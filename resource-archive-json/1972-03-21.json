Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last week when I took part in the debate on\r\n\r\nthe  Budget presented by the Minister, I  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  a  progressive Budget,  which  would\r\n\r\nbenefit   the  development  of  our  commerce   and\r\n\r\nindustry. Today, I still hold this point  of  view,\r\n\r\nand  that  is,  that the Minister for  Finance  has\r\n\r\nprepared a healthy and progressive Budget.  What  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to raise here is the question  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  provisions and whether they are adequately\r\n\r\nallocated.   On  7th  March,  when   the   Minister\r\n\r\npresented  the Budget in this House, he  emphasised\r\n\r\nthat  the main reason why it has not been necessary\r\n\r\nto  increase  taxes over the last three  years  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the rapid development of our  commerce\r\n\r\nand industry leading to an increase in revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch upon the provisions\r\n\r\nfor  the  various  departments. I think  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain areas which we need to discuss and examine.\r\n\r\nThe  total  provision amounted  to  the  figure  of\r\n\r\n$1,448,692,350.   In   terms   of    the    various\r\n\r\ndepartments,   the  allocation  for   Defence   and\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  is  38.9  per  cent.  This   is\r\n\r\nnecessary in order to strengthen our defence and to\r\n\r\nmaintain  our  internal security.  Social  Services\r\n\r\naccounted  for 26.6 per cent, Statutory Expenditure\r\n\r\naccounted for 15.1 per cent, and Economic  Services\r\n\r\naccounted for only 7.8 per cent. What I would  like\r\n\r\nto  raise  here is in regard to Economic  Services.\r\n\r\n7.8  per  cent  appears to me as  rather  low.  The\r\n\r\nMinister himself has mentioned that the increase in\r\n\r\nrevenue is due\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  rapid  development  of  our  commerce  and\r\n\r\nindustry,   and   these   Economic   Services   are\r\n\r\nbeneficial to economic expansion and industrial and\r\n\r\ncommercial  development. Therefore, we should  have\r\n\r\nadequate  provision for Economic  Services.  If  we\r\n\r\ncompare  Economic Services to the goose  that  lays\r\n\r\nthe  golden  egg,  then we should provide  adequate\r\n\r\nnutrition  for this goose. It is only by  providing\r\n\r\nadequate  nutrition that this goose can be expected\r\n\r\nto  lay a great quantity of golden eggs, so that we\r\n\r\ncan  have better results in our economic expansion.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, this goose, suffering from malnutrition,\r\n\r\nwill  be sickly and contract a lot of diseases.  If\r\n\r\nthis is the case, I believe we will not be able  to\r\n\r\nget  any eggs from this goose. Mr Speaker, Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis for this reason that I believe the provision for\r\n\r\nEconomic  Services  is inadequate  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nshould  be increased. In addition, I would like  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister to explain the details related  to\r\n\r\nEconomic Services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is in\r\n\r\nregard  to  external trade. Last  year,  our  trade\r\n\r\ndeficit  has increased to the phenomenal amount  of\r\n\r\n$3,000  million. The Minister for Finance explained\r\n\r\nto us last year that we do not have to worry unduly\r\n\r\nabout  trade deficit because this can be offset  by\r\n\r\nincomes  received from other sources, such as  ship\r\n\r\nrepairing, port services, and tourism. I would like\r\n\r\nto  know  whether the $3,000 million trade  deficit\r\n\r\nlast  year  has been sufficiently set  off  by  the\r\n\r\nincomes from other sources. Can the Minister please\r\n\r\nexplain to this House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to mention is in\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  stability  of  price  levels.  The\r\n\r\nMinister has already acknowledged that there is  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the general level of prices. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI think he should take adequate measures to control\r\n\r\nprices  to  ensure a better standard of living  for\r\n\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This\r\n\r\nhas  caused  a  lot  of  frustration  among  junior\r\n\r\nofficers,  because they feel that their chances  of\r\n\r\npromotion  are  nullified by  these  retired  civil\r\n\r\nservants who are re-employed in some of the  senior\r\n\r\nposts.  I  am not objecting to their re-employment,\r\n\r\nbut  whether their experience is necessary for  the\r\n\r\nbetterment of the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a certain amount of brain drain\r\n\r\namong the civil servants who, after having received\r\n\r\ntheir  scholarships, come back only to resign after\r\n\r\nserving  for a few years. This form of brain  drain\r\n\r\nmust  be  stopped, because the civil servants  make\r\n\r\nuse  of  the civil service as a stepping stone  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own betterment. We cannot have them  holding\r\n\r\nthe civil service by the throat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would suggest that better conditions\r\n\r\nof  service  should  be considered  for  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants.  As  far  as possible,  the  gap  in  pay\r\n\r\nbetween  the public and private sectors  should  be\r\n\r\nnarrowed, and so prevent a brain drain in the civil\r\n\r\nservice.  Furthermore. I would suggest  that  civil\r\n\r\nservants  should be recruited on a contract  basis,\r\n\r\nso that the knowledge and experience that they gain\r\n\r\nwill not be lost to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment after a short employment. Otherwise,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  a  waste  of Government  expenditure  to\r\n\r\nrecruit and train these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether a varying scale\r\n\r\nof  a  maximum  of three annual increments  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  salary scales can be granted to an officer\r\n\r\nfor  any  one  year. Entitlement  to  this  special\r\n\r\nincrement   should  depend  on   the   merits   and\r\n\r\ncapabilities  of  the individual.  It  will  be  an\r\n\r\nincentive for the officers to give of their best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the low income group is concerned, I\r\n\r\nhave  the  greatest sympathy for them.  There  have\r\n\r\nbeen complaints about the rising cost of living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  although the Minister  for  Finance  is\r\n\r\nmaking  every effort to bridge the gap between  the\r\n\r\nlower  and  higher  income groups  by  way  of  tax\r\n\r\nreliefs  which he has announced in Parliament  last\r\n\r\nweek.  However. I still feel that the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup  should get more benefits in the revision  of\r\n\r\ntheir  emoluments,  and I hope the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil will look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one example of dissatisfaction in the civil\r\n\r\nservice  can  be  seen  in the  case  of  temporary\r\n\r\nofficers   engaged   on  a  month-to-month   basis.\r\n\r\nSometimes  they are asked to act in a senior  post.\r\n\r\nHowever,  when  a vacancy for the  senior  post  is\r\n\r\nadvertised,  these  officers are unfortunately  not\r\n\r\neligible  to apply. Some other officers, with  whom\r\n\r\nthe temporary officers are familiar, will take over\r\n\r\nthe  post.  Why cannot these temporary officers  be\r\n\r\nconfirmed  as  permanent officers in  their  senior\r\n\r\nposts?  Can  the Minister look into it and  rectify\r\n\r\nthe matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our local population has a\r\n\r\nprejudice  against locally-made products.  This  is\r\n\r\njustified to a great extent. If one were to  import\r\n\r\na certain product which is also produced locally, a\r\n\r\ncertain  difference in quality can be noticed.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  a  certain brand of tooth-paste  made  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia foams better in the mouth than the  tooth-paste   of   the   same  brand  produced   locally.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, cars manufactured and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassembled by the parent company overseas are  of  a\r\n\r\nsuperior  quality  to cars of  the  same  make  but\r\n\r\nassembled locally.. Surely something can be done by\r\n\r\nlocal  manufacturers who produce goods of a certain\r\n\r\nquality   for  local  consumption  and  of  another\r\n\r\nquality for export purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  am obliged  to  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  for  his  comments  and  sentiments  for\r\n\r\nadequate  provision for the Economic Services  and,\r\n\r\nin particular, industrial development with which  I\r\n\r\nmust  fully  agree. He has asked for  some  details\r\n\r\nregarding the allocation for Economic Services. May\r\n\r\nI  refer him to Appendix F of the Main Estimates of\r\n\r\nRevenue  and Expenditure for 1972-73,  in  which  a\r\n\r\nvery detailed breakdown is given of expenditure  by\r\n\r\nfunctional classification. It will be observed that\r\n\r\nall  the  departments  and Ministries  involved  in\r\n\r\nproviding  economic  services have  been  allocated\r\n\r\nadequate funds for their needs. As I have explained\r\n\r\nin  the Budget Statement, the apparent reduction in\r\n\r\nthe  provision for Economic Services is due to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that the Telecommunications Department is  to\r\n\r\nbecome  a  statutory authority and,  therefore,  no\r\n\r\nprovision   has   been  made  for   its   recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  which was allocated  a  sum  of  $19.4\r\n\r\nmillion in the 1971-72 Estimates. If this is  taken\r\n\r\ninto   account,  it  will  be  observed  that   the\r\n\r\nprovision for Economic Services has, in fact,  been\r\n\r\nincreased from $107.5 million in 1971-72 to $113.14\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1972-73. I should also like  to  remind\r\n\r\nthe  Member that the amount we have entered in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Estimates  does not  constitute  all  the\r\n\r\nbudgetary  provision  for  Economic  Services,   as\r\n\r\nprovision is also made in the Development Estimates\r\n\r\nfor  expenditure  on Economic Services.  It  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  noted that with the increased  allocation\r\n\r\nfor  Defence and Social Services, the proportionate\r\n\r\nshare  of  the  expenditure for  Economic  Services\r\n\r\nwould tend to be marginally smaller, even when  the\r\n\r\nactual   quantum   of  funds  provided   has   been\r\n\r\nincreased. I can assure the Member that adequate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunds will always be made available for departments\r\n\r\nproviding economic services, and that there  is  no\r\n\r\nintention  on the part of the Treasury  to  curtail\r\n\r\ntheir expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also asked a\r\n\r\nquestion  on  the  widening trade gap  of  $3,283.7\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1971 as compared with $2,778.0  million\r\n\r\nin  1970. This should give no cause for alarm.  The\r\n\r\npreliminary  figures  for  the  1971   balance   of\r\n\r\npayments  show that we have some $847.5 million  in\r\n\r\nour  favour compared with $416.5 million for  1970.\r\n\r\nThis  represents  a 103 per cent  increase  in  our\r\n\r\nreserves.  Some  reasons  for  the  trends  in  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of payment figures had been given  in  the\r\n\r\n1970  and  1971 Budget debates. If I may summarise,\r\n\r\nit  should  be appreciated that the widening  trade\r\n\r\ngap is fairly common in a developing country, owing\r\n\r\nto  the  need to purchase large amounts of  capital\r\n\r\ngoods,    particularly    heavy    machinery    and\r\n\r\ntransportation  equipment.  Of  the  trade  gap  of\r\n\r\n$3,283.7  million in 1971, import of machinery  and\r\n\r\ntransportation   equipment  alone   accounted   for\r\n\r\n$2,209.1  million. Even if we discount  the  $740.5\r\n\r\nmillion  for export of machinery and transportation\r\n\r\nequipment  from  Singapore,  the  retained  imports\r\n\r\nstill amounted to $1,568.0 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which has to be made is that the\r\n\r\ntrade balance is not the only factor in the balance\r\n\r\nof  payments.  It is offset by increased  invisible\r\n\r\nearnings  from,  firstly, entrepot trade  services,\r\n\r\nincluding  finance, banking, insurance and  freight\r\n\r\nearnings.   Secondly,   unrecorded   purchases   by\r\n\r\ntourists and transportation personnel, such as ship\r\n\r\nand   air   crew.  Thirdly,  ship  building,   ship\r\n\r\nrepairing,  supplies  to  vessels,  oil  rigs   and\r\n\r\naircraft  using Singapore as a base. Fourthly,  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial  under-coverage by  the  trade  balance\r\n\r\nfigures,  which is indicated by the large balancing\r\n\r\nitem of $3,045.2 million in our balance of payments\r\n\r\nbalance   sheet.  Some  redistribution   of   these\r\n\r\nbalancing  items could be attempted  and  would  be\r\n\r\nlargely  made  on the credit side  of  the  Current\r\n\r\nAccount, particularly on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerchandise  trade, also on Capital  Account.  This\r\n\r\nattempt to redistribute the balancing items has not\r\n\r\nbeen  made since comprehensive data on these  flows\r\n\r\nare  not available to enable this to be done  on  a\r\n\r\nreliable  basis. Nevertheless, I think it would  be\r\n\r\nhealthy  to see our exports increase substantially.\r\n\r\nSingapore's total exports in 1971 registered  a  13\r\n\r\nper  cent  increase over the 1970  performance.  In\r\n\r\naddition   to  the  introduction  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nExpansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax)  Act,\r\n\r\na  new export promotion unit is being set up in the\r\n\r\nTrade  Division in 1972-73 to undertake studies  of\r\n\r\nexport  markets and to take full advantage  of  the\r\n\r\npreferential treatment offered by various developed\r\n\r\ncountries   to   assist  developing  countries   to\r\n\r\nincrease exports of locally manufactured goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's last comment on the matter of\r\n\r\nprice  increases, the Government is doing  what  it\r\n\r\ncan   to   stabilise  the  prices  of   foodstuffs,\r\n\r\nespecially    basic   necessities.   Manufacturers,\r\n\r\nimporters,  and  members of the distributive  trade\r\n\r\nhave been warned against taking undue advantage  of\r\n\r\nany  situation  that presents  itself  to  jack  up\r\n\r\nprices.  In this respect, I think officers  of  the\r\n\r\nSupplies Office are continually checking on  prices\r\n\r\nof  foodstuffs  in  all  localities  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever, Singapore cannot remain totally immune  to\r\n\r\nchanges  in  supply  and demand  for  food  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational  scene. Nevertheless, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  to  step  in  to  help the consumers  wherever\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail price of locally refined sugar has\r\n\r\nremained stable at 39 cents a katty, or $550 a  ton\r\n\r\nex-factory,  with duty, since February  last  year,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  fact that world prices of  raw  sugar\r\n\r\nhave  shot up from \u015349 or $360 per ton to over  \u015390\r\n\r\nor  $661.50 per ton currently -- I think it will be\r\n\r\nappreciated  that there has been concern  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  over  the  rise in the  price  of  their\r\n\r\nsugar. To safeguard the consumers in Singapore,  an\r\n\r\nexport  control  is also placed on locally  refined\r\n\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as wheat flour is concerned, the retail\r\n\r\nprice  of  25  cents per katty has remained  stable\r\n\r\nsince the beginning of 1971. Rice prices have  also\r\n\r\nremained  very  firm.  Since  January  last   year,\r\n\r\nwholesale  prices for the two Thai  top-grade  rice\r\n\r\nhave declined from $33.50 and $26 per picul to  its\r\n\r\npresent   price   of   $32  and   $25   per   picul\r\n\r\nrespectively. The price of China top-grade rice has\r\n\r\nalso dropped during the same period from $26.25  to\r\n\r\nthe present value of $23.50 per picul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On condensed milk, the price of popular brands\r\n\r\nhas  remained at 60 cents for a 14-ounce tin  since\r\n\r\nSeptember  last year. Over this period, the  prices\r\n\r\nof raw materials have gone up considerably. Skimmed\r\n\r\nmilk  prices have increased on an average of $1,000\r\n\r\nto $1,200 a ton, while butter fat prices have risen\r\n\r\nfrom  $2,400  to $3,300 a ton. The Government  has,\r\n\r\ntherefore, done a fair amount of work in trying  to\r\n\r\nstabilise the prices of basic commodities. However,\r\n\r\nI  welcome  the  establishment  last  year  by  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  of the Consumers'  Association  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  which is very active in  looking  after\r\n\r\nthe  interests of consumers and is working  closely\r\n\r\nwith our Trade Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I understand the National Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress  is presently studying the feasibility  of\r\n\r\nsetting  up a Consumers' Co-operative, and  that  a\r\n\r\npilot  project will be launched in the near future.\r\n\r\nWith  the  close  co-operation of  consumers,  this\r\n\r\nproject should prove successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, first of all, raised the\r\n\r\npoint  of  the 13th monthly salary to  be  paid  to\r\n\r\npensioners. I think the intention of the scheme  is\r\n\r\nreally .a 13th month salary payment. So it is not a\r\n\r\n13th  month pension. In the circumstances, it  does\r\n\r\nnot  fall within the scope of the 13th month salary\r\n\r\nscheme or the non-pensionable annual allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also made some comment on the question\r\n\r\nof  terms  and  conditions  of  service  for  civil\r\n\r\nservants and, particularly, for those who have just\r\n\r\nreturned from overseas. I believe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis   comment  is  prompted  by  concern  over  the\r\n\r\npossible resignation of civil servants to join  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector. The present practice, of course, is\r\n\r\nthat  the Public Service Commission appoints higher\r\n\r\nlevel   personnel,   including   professional   and\r\n\r\ntechnical personnel, to the permanent establishment\r\n\r\nso as to offer them a long-term career in the civil\r\n\r\nservice. The Member suggested offering contracts. A\r\n\r\nsmall number of officers have been appointed  on  a\r\n\r\ntemporary basis because they so prefer it. In other\r\n\r\ncases, it is because they are required for specific\r\n\r\nprojects of a temporary nature only. However,  such\r\n\r\ntemporary  officers with proven ability  have  been\r\n\r\nand  will be offered permanent appointment if  they\r\n\r\nwish.  Those  who  were appointed  initially  on  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  basis  because  their  jobs  were   only\r\n\r\ntemporary  jobs can apply when permanent  vacancies\r\n\r\narise.  The  policy  of the P.S.C, is  to  conduct\r\n\r\nfrequent  promotion exercises so  that  outstanding\r\n\r\nand  promising  officers  will  obtain  accelerated\r\n\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion in the professional services is now\r\n\r\nbased  on  merit rather than for filling posts,  so\r\n\r\nthat where there are deserving officers, the P.S.C.\r\n\r\nwill  recommend their promotion even  though  there\r\n\r\nare insufficient established vacancies. As an added\r\n\r\nincentive  to promising officers, the  policy  with\r\n\r\nregard  to acting appointments is that these should\r\n\r\nalso  be made on merit and not on seniority.  Also,\r\n\r\npensioners  are  not  normally  re-employed  unless\r\n\r\nthere   are  exceptional  reasons,  such  as  acute\r\n\r\nshortage  of  experienced  staff  in  a  particular\r\n\r\ngrade.  In  every  case  of  re-employment   of   a\r\n\r\npensioner,  Government ensures that  this  is  done\r\n\r\nwithout  depriving  the serving officers  of  their\r\n\r\npromotion prospects. With near-full employment,  it\r\n\r\nmay,  in  fact,  become increasingly  necessary  to\r\n\r\nemploy  more  pensioners who are still  healthy  in\r\n\r\nmind and body and who can contribute positively  to\r\n\r\nthe economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it difficult, however, to accept the\r\n\r\nMember's  suggestion to replace the present  annual\r\n\r\nincremental practice with a three-year increment in\r\n\r\nall cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also made one comment with\r\n\r\nregard  to locally-made products. I heartily  agree\r\n\r\nthat  these  products should be made  more  popular\r\n\r\namong  our own consumers. I think the schemes which\r\n\r\nhave been instituted by the Singapore Institute  of\r\n\r\nStandards  and Industrial Research should  make  it\r\n\r\nplain   to  all  local  consumers  that  our  local\r\n\r\nproducts  are  just  as good  as  those  which  are\r\n\r\nimported. I hope they will give their full  support\r\n\r\nto  the  consumption of local products, instead  of\r\n\r\nimported products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  thank  the Minister for answering  all  my\r\n\r\nthree  questions. He has given a very comprehensive\r\n\r\nand adequate answer. Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> (Punggol): Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I would like to\r\n\r\nrefer the Minister for Finance to two Reports which\r\n\r\nhave  been  presented to this  House.  One  is  the\r\n\r\nReport  of  the  Auditor-General for the  financial\r\n\r\nyear  1969-70 contained in Paper Cmd.  14  of  1971\r\n\r\npresented  to Parliament on l7ti July,  1971.  The\r\n\r\nother  is  the First Report of the Public  Accounts\r\n\r\nCommittee  contained  in  Paper  Pan.  1  of   1972\r\n\r\npresented  to  Parliament on 12th  February,  1972.\r\n\r\nSir, whilst browsing through the Auditor- General's\r\n\r\nReport,  I was given the impression that losses  of\r\n\r\npublic  funds in the various departments  were  the\r\n\r\nresult   of   the  officials  in  the   departments\r\n\r\nconcerned  not being conversant with the  financial\r\n\r\nprocedures  or  that they have been  overworked  in\r\n\r\nsome cases. The First Report of the Public Accounts\r\n\r\nCommittee  bears testimony to this  fact.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to quote the comments in page 2 of this Report\r\n\r\nunder the heading \"Irregularities\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`8. Perusing the Audit Report your Committee\r\n\r\nnoted  the number of irregularities which were,  in\r\n\r\nthe main, due to weaknesses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  accounting system or because the financial\r\n\r\nofficers concerned were not sufficiently acquainted\r\n\r\nwith and did not follow the safeguards laid down in\r\n\r\nthe Instruction Manuals.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Further  down,  the Public Accounts Committee  made\r\n\r\nsome recommendations, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`9. As an immediate measure, your Committee\r\n\r\nrecommend that attention of all accounting officers\r\n\r\nshould  be  drawn  to  these two  common  areas  of\r\n\r\nweaknesses  so that they may be more  vigilant  and\r\n\r\ntake necessary action to prevent the occurrences or\r\n\r\nrecurrences of such irregularities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. As a long term measure, your Committee feel\r\n\r\nthat the whole problem should be tackled on a wider\r\n\r\nbasis  of co-ordination and improvement of  general\r\n\r\nfinancial administration and supervision, including\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  modern mechanical aids and computers,\r\n\r\nand  that  a  proper training scheme  for  officers\r\n\r\nshould  be  formulated  and  implemented.  For  the\r\n\r\nimmediate future, your Committee recommend that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance look into the feasibility  of\r\n\r\ncreating  a cadre of trained financial officers  at\r\n\r\nvarious  levels  for  posting  to  Ministries   and\r\n\r\nDepartments  to strengthen financial administration\r\n\r\nand  supervision as well as improve  efficiency  of\r\n\r\nfinancial work in all sectors.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know whether the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance will take immediate remedial action  as\r\n\r\na  result of the two Reports. Of course, I am fully\r\n\r\naware  that  the  Public Accounts Committees  First\r\n\r\nReport  was  presented only last  month,  lest  the\r\n\r\nMinister  should say, \"We have just  received  this\r\n\r\nFirst  Report  and it is now being studied  with  a\r\n\r\nview to taking appropriate action as soon as a full\r\n\r\nevaluation of the Report has been made.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to enquire from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance whether his Ministry will\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing aided school teachers  to  apply\r\n\r\nfor   holiday  bungalows  in  Changi,  which   were\r\n\r\nrecently acquired by the Government from the  Royal\r\n\r\nAir  Force,  on  the same terms  offered  to  their\r\n\r\ncounterparts in the Government service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this inquiry, I am prompted by two\r\n\r\nconsiderations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The recent policy of the Finance Ministry is\r\n\r\nto allow members of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  to  occupy such bungalows, thus  indicating\r\n\r\nthat  the availability of holiday bungalows exceeds\r\n\r\nthe needs of civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That aided school teachers are granted\r\n\r\nmedical facilities like their counterparts  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service. That being so, will  they  also\r\n\r\nbe   granted   the   same   privileges   as   their\r\n\r\ncounterparts in the Government service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, regarding the irregularities\r\n\r\nin  the accounting system, whether indicated by the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General in his Report which has  just  been\r\n\r\nreceived,  or  whether they  are  detected  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  or  Departments themselves  or  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance, they are always very carefully\r\n\r\nstudied and, where possible, remedies are taken. In\r\n\r\nany  big organisation, however, we must expect that\r\n\r\noccasional flaws in the accounting system  will  be\r\n\r\ndiscovered. The other area of weakness,  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  suggested as being responsible for losses  of\r\n\r\npublic  funds,  is overworking the staff.  On  this\r\n\r\nmatter  I  have,  in response to questions  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on my annual Budget Statement, stated  that\r\n\r\nthe  remedy  to prevent civil servants  from  being\r\n\r\noverworked is to try and retain more of them and to\r\n\r\nrecruit  them  on a more acceptable basis.  On  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  the Government accounting system  is  on  a\r\n\r\nfirm   and  sound  base.  Nevertheless,  there   is\r\n\r\nconsiderable scope for improvement, and  steps  are\r\n\r\nbeing  taken  to increase the use of computers  and\r\n\r\nother  mechanical aids, as suggested by the Member,\r\n\r\nso  that  the element of human fallibility  can  be\r\n\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion was that the weaknesses in\r\n\r\nthe   accounting  system  may   be   due   to   the\r\n\r\nunfamiliarity  of the financial officers  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  proper financial procedures.  To  remedy\r\n\r\nthis, courses on financial administration are being\r\n\r\nconducted  by  the  Staff  Training  Institute  for\r\n\r\nDivisions  I and II officers. Subjects on financial\r\n\r\nsystem  and  procedures, annual budgets,  financial\r\n\r\ncontrol, losses of public moneys\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  stores,  contract  and stores  procedures  are\r\n\r\nincluded  in the courses conducted by the Institute\r\n\r\nfor administrative and executive officers, and they\r\n\r\nwill continue to be included in future courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein asked whether the Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry will allow aided school teachers to  apply\r\n\r\nfor holiday bungalows in Changi. The answer is that\r\n\r\nthey  are  eligible  to apply  as  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  I  believe,  however,  the  suggestion  is\r\n\r\nprompted  by the desire to give them priority  over\r\n\r\nother  members of the public, in the  same  way  as\r\n\r\nfacilities   are  given  them  in  the   Government\r\n\r\nhospitals.  However, I will look into  this  matter\r\n\r\nand,  assuming that we have an over-supply of these\r\n\r\nholiday   bungalows,  we  will  certainly  consider\r\n\r\nmaking them available to the aided school teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In the light of the Minister's\r\n\r\nreply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

A few months ago  when  I\r\n\r\nhad occasion to be in hospital for a short time,  I\r\n\r\nwas  surprised  to hear complaints made  by  senior\r\n\r\nstaff  members about an item of furniture,  namely,\r\n\r\narmchairs, supplied by the Central Supplies  Office\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry  of Health. They were  complaints\r\n\r\nthat  the  item of furniture received showed  early\r\n\r\nsigns of deterioration, and on one occasion a chair\r\n\r\ncollapsed under the weight of a patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask is whether\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments are forced  to  accept  the\r\n\r\ngoods provided by the Central Supplies Office, even\r\n\r\nif  they  are reluctant to accept the goods because\r\n\r\nthey  are  able to get similar items  of  equal  or\r\n\r\nbetter  quality and at a cheaper price  than  those\r\n\r\nsupplied.

Wherever   possible,\r\n\r\nsamples  are  examined before the actual  purchases\r\n\r\nare   made.  It  must  be  recognised  that   large\r\n\r\nquantities of supplies are usually consumed and, as\r\n\r\npublic  funds  should  be spent  judiciously,  they\r\n\r\ncannot always be of the best quality available.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, I accept the Member's point  that\r\n\r\nthe   cheapest   are  not  necessarily   the   most\r\n\r\neconomical and that mistakes of judgment, which are\r\n\r\noccasionally    made   in   regard    to    quality\r\n\r\nspecifications  should  be  corrected  by  constant\r\n\r\nreview  of  such specifications. On the  particular\r\n\r\nexample of the hospital chair, I am obliged to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  the information, and I  will  ask  the\r\n\r\nChief Supplies Officer to look into the matter.

The\r\n\r\ndeficit itself is largely due to the fact that  for\r\n\r\nthe one-room and two-room flats the rentals charged\r\n\r\nare  not  sufficient to cover the  operating  cost,\r\n\r\nincluding   the   provision   of   amenities    and\r\n\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in subsidy required is due to two\r\n\r\nfactors;  firstly, the increase in  the  number  of\r\n\r\ntenants living in one-room flats and, secondly, the\r\n\r\nincreasing  cost of providing amenities and  proper\r\n\r\nmaintenance of the housing estates. As at  the  end\r\n\r\nof  1971,  the  number of Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard flats under rental was 89,500, of which  one-room and two-room flats amounted to 69,982. In 1972\r\n\r\nthe  Board is planning to build another 9,100  one-room  flats. Most of these flats are being used  to\r\n\r\nhouse  families affected by the various development\r\n\r\nprojects  under  the  urban  renewal  schemes,  and\r\n\r\nindustrial and other development schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in the number of tenants living\r\n\r\nin  subsidised Housing and Development Board flats,\r\n\r\nit is inevitable that the Government subsidy has to\r\n\r\nbe   proportionally  increased.  It  may  also   be\r\n\r\nmentioned   that  the  rentals  for   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats were fixed in 1960-61,  and\r\n\r\nsince  then there have naturally been increases  in\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  providing services,  amenities,  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  estates.  It  is  not  possible  to\r\n\r\nprovide  separate  data on the  various  components\r\n\r\nthat  make the subsidy, as these increases are only\r\n\r\nreflected  in the overall deficit in the  operating\r\n\r\nexpenses  of  the Board. The preliminary  financial\r\n\r\nstatement of the Housing and Development Board  for\r\n\r\nthe   year  1971-72  indicates  that  the   subsidy\r\n\r\nrequired will be in the region of $10 million.  The\r\n\r\nfinal  figure will be determined when  the  audited\r\n\r\naccounts of the Board become available around  June\r\n\r\nor  July,  1972.  The total number of  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  units  completed  in  1971  was\r\n\r\n16,147.  Of these, 6,898 units were sold,  and  the\r\n\r\nrest were for rental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would you allow me\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister a favour on this same subhead,\r\n\r\nplease?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, in respect of the subsidy to\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board, I also  presume\r\n\r\nthat,  as the Minister has said, this sum is  being\r\n\r\nused  for  certain amenities - in the  case  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  the  construction  of   a   swimming\r\n\r\ncomplex.

In other words,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot specifically for the use of one Ministry or any\r\n\r\nindividual officer. Persons entertained under  this\r\n\r\nvote are usually officers of other governments  and\r\n\r\ninternational organisations visiting  Singapore  on\r\n\r\nofficial  missions,  or for hi-lateral  talks.

Therefore,  in  regard  to  entertainment\r\n\r\nexpenses  incurred by Parliamentary Secretaries  in\r\n\r\nentertaining official foreign guests, such expenses\r\n\r\ncan be charged to the \"Entertainment Expenses\" vote\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry.  In fact,  I  thought  all  such\r\n\r\nexpenses  are currently being paid out of the  vote\r\n\r\nwhich   is  more  commonly  referred  to   as   the\r\n\r\nMinister's     entertainment     expenses     vote.\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries can and do, in fact, make\r\n\r\nuse of this vote with the concurrence, implicit  or\r\n\r\notherwise,  of  the  Minister  concerned.  It   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  incorrect  to  say  that  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries are not benefiting from such  facility.\r\n\r\nIf  any  of  them are out of pocket, it is  because\r\n\r\nthey do not make a claim; it is not because of  any\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  against  them.  If  there  is   any\r\n\r\nshortage  of  funds, they can always apply  to  the\r\n\r\nTreasury for reimbursement from the central vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, my question on the air\r\n\r\npassages for Parliamentary Secretaries has not been\r\n\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, this expenditure does not\r\n\r\ncome  under this particular entertainment  expenses\r\n\r\nvote.

It   is   inadequate   for   their\r\n\r\nactivities.  It is common knowledge  that  cultural\r\n\r\nactivities certainly require an assistance of  more\r\n\r\nthan $10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the policy statement of the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister we know that our economy has established a\r\n\r\nfirm  foundation.  At the same  time  we  are  also\r\n\r\npromoting a gracious living in Singapore because we\r\n\r\ndo   not   want   to  produce  ugly   Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  would like to ask the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  to  allocate more funds as a  contribution\r\n\r\nfor   the  promotion  of  cultural  activities   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the largest theatre in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  the  National  Theatre.  Though  it  is  called\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre, it is not run by the State,  but\r\n\r\nby the National Theatre Trust. Notwithstanding this\r\n\r\nfact,  Sir, under the planning and organisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  National  Theatre Trust,  various  significant\r\n\r\nactivities  have been carried out in  the  cultural\r\n\r\nfront. But this is not a direct management from the\r\n\r\nState. Because of this, the National Theatre  Trust\r\n\r\nis  annually faced with financial deficits of  more\r\n\r\nthan  $200,000  per annum. It has  to  make  public\r\n\r\nappeals  for  donations  every  year  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndeficit. What I fail to understand is why  has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  not allocated a sum of  $200,000  to  5\r\n\r\n300.000  to the National Theatre Trust to  make  it\r\n\r\npossible   for  the  National  Theatre   Trust   to\r\n\r\nsuccessfully   promote   cultural   activities   in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  I  would like to ask the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance not to stinge on the cultural expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read in the newspapers that a cultural\r\n\r\nmission  was sent to Adelaide to take part  in  the\r\n\r\ncultural  festival  under  the  leadership  of  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture. It was a great success and the performance\r\n\r\nwas  applauded by thousands of Australians, thereby\r\n\r\nenabling them to have a better image of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this basis I would like the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  to  allocate more sums to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  to set up a permanent cultural mission  to\r\n\r\nvisit and perform in various countries overseas. In\r\n\r\nthe   first  place,  this  will  promote   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  in Singapore. In the second  place,  it\r\n\r\nwill  give  added  publicity to Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\npromotion of our tourist trade. I think a  cultural\r\n\r\nmission  is  a better means of promoting  Singapore\r\n\r\nthan  mediums or trishaws organised by the  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board. I hope the Minister will  consider\r\n\r\nthis matter seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is considered unnecessary at this stage for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to take over the National Theatre  Trust\r\n\r\nas  it  is running the National Theatre quite well.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the National Theatre Trust has a 40-member  Chinese  orchestra and  a  38-member  choir\r\n\r\ncomprising  amateurs who rehearse and perform  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time.  It is envisaged  that  if  such  a\r\n\r\nChinese orchestra and choir were to be formed  into\r\n\r\na  permanent, or even a semi-professional  body,  a\r\n\r\nlarge  amount of money would have to come from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  quite  agree with  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong that more money should be allocated to  this\r\n\r\nsubhead  so that we can assist cultural  bodies  in\r\n\r\nthe   Republic   to   carry  out   their   cultural\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on the suggestion of the\r\n\r\nMember with regard to organising a permanent troupe\r\n\r\nto  perform  overseas  as a promotional  effort  to\r\n\r\npublicise  Singapore and to project a  true  multi-racial  image of Singapore. As Members know,  early\r\n\r\nthis  month  we  sent  a 62-member-strong  cultural\r\n\r\ndelegation  to  Adelaide. This  delegation  put  up\r\n\r\nperformances   which   were  well   received.   The\r\n\r\nperformances  were  spectacular and  colourful  not\r\n\r\nonly  in  themselves but also in the  costumes  and\r\n\r\npresentation  and made a tremendous impact  on  the\r\n\r\nAustralian  audience. Apart from the  audiences  in\r\n\r\nAdelaide, the performances were telecast live over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntelevision  throughout Australia. I have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat the performances by this troupe have made  the\r\n\r\nAustralians  much more aware of the  multi-cultural\r\n\r\nand  multi-racial  content of Singapore,  and  will\r\n\r\ncertainly implant in their minds a desire  to  come\r\n\r\nto  Singapore or at least to stop over at Singapore\r\n\r\nand see things for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This no doubt will be a big boost to the tourist\r\n\r\ntrade,  and  with  it the hotels,  restaurants  and\r\n\r\nnight  -club  businesses. If  the  sending  of  one\r\n\r\ncultural   delegation  abroad  can  have   such   a\r\n\r\nreaction, it logically follows therefore that if we\r\n\r\nsend more cultural troupes overseas, the image will\r\n\r\nbe  even more pronounced provided, of course,  that\r\n\r\nthe standard of performances is of a high level.  I\r\n\r\nshould  point  out, however, that  my  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nconsidering  the possibility of organising  such  a\r\n\r\ncultural troupe either on a permanent or on a part-time basis, and also how best this troupe should be\r\n\r\norganised and maintained, and the best way in which\r\n\r\nthis  can  be  done. But whilst we may provide  the\r\n\r\nwherewithal to present our cultural activities,  we\r\n\r\nare  not in a position to promote Singapore's image\r\n\r\noverseas principally because of the lack of  funds.\r\n\r\nThis  is  essentially  a  matter  for  the  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board. As Members may be aware, sending a\r\n\r\ncultural  troupe  overseas costs a  lot  of  money,\r\n\r\nquite   apart  from  the  time  spent  on  constant\r\n\r\nrehearsals and training. There is also the question\r\n\r\nof   providing  air  fares,  costumes,   insurance,\r\n\r\nallowances and other incidentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the suggestion of the Member is worth\r\n\r\npursuing  as  the  promotion of  Singapore's  image\r\n\r\nabroad  is  a matter which, I consider, rests  with\r\n\r\nthe  Tourist Promotion Board. I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe    Tourist   Promotion   Board   give   serious\r\n\r\nconsideration  to such ventures in  the  future  by\r\n\r\nproviding,   in  liaison  with  Mercury   Singapore\r\n\r\nAirlines, which will be soon our national  airline,\r\n\r\nand  the  hotels  and other tourist establishments,\r\n\r\nthe necessary facilities for travel, accommodation,\r\n\r\nallowances,  etc.,  to  make  such  overseas  trips\r\n\r\npossible, thereby propagating the idea of Singapore\r\n\r\nas a multi-racial,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural   Republic,   and    thus\r\n\r\nattracting  more tourists to our island.  I  cannot\r\n\r\nthink  of  a  more potent way in which the  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board can help itself to fulfil its  main\r\n\r\nfunction  of  attracting tourists to Singapore,  as\r\n\r\nhas been suggested by the Member for Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  somewhat taken by surprise by the reply. I  was\r\n\r\ntrying to speak for the Ministry of Culture to  get\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Finance to give  more  money  for\r\n\r\ncultural  activities.  However,  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  does  not  seem to think  that  this  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  The question is this. Is  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre  worthy  of financial assistance  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  If so, it should give  more  money  so\r\n\r\nthat  it would not have to run into annual deficits\r\n\r\nof  more  than $200,000, which can only be  met  by\r\n\r\ncontributions  or  donations from  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic. If it has to carry on like this every year,\r\n\r\nthe difficulties will be great. What will happen to\r\n\r\nthe  National Theatre if it fails to get sufficient\r\n\r\ndonations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I\r\n\r\nhave  said just now, I fully agree with the  Member\r\n\r\nthat more money should be allocated to the National\r\n\r\nTheatre  Trust in order that it can carry  out  its\r\n\r\ncultural  activities. I promise I  will  look  into\r\n\r\nthis  matter, and also draw my Minister's attention\r\n\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate very\r\n\r\nmuch  that cultural activities should be subsidised\r\n\r\nby  the  Government, there are always other  claims\r\n\r\nand  my  Ministry can only allocate funds according\r\n\r\nto  the  priorities set down by the Government.  In\r\n\r\nthe  particular case of the Adelaide  Festival,  to\r\n\r\nwhich  we  sent a very successful cultural mission,\r\n\r\nmay  I  point out that no provision was,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nmade in the 1971-72 Estimates. However, because  of\r\n\r\nthe  importance of participation in this particular\r\n\r\nfestival,  the Ministry of Finance did provide  the\r\n\r\nmoney  even  though there was no provision  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.  Therefore, it  can  he  seen  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is,  in  fact,  placing   considerable\r\n\r\nemphasis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   culture.

He\r\n\r\nhas   also  pointed  out  that  we  have   a   huge\r\n\r\norganisation like the National Theatre Trust  which\r\n\r\ndepends  on public donations year after  year.  His\r\n\r\nquestion is whether or not it is advisable for  the\r\n\r\nTrust to carry on in this way, in view of the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  difficult to go out for donations.  I\r\n\r\nappreciate the reply of the Minister of State  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  set down  priorities  on  the\r\n\r\nallocation of funds but, in respect of the cultural\r\n\r\ntroupe  to  the Adelaide Festival, much  money  was\r\n\r\nspent although there was no provision for it in the\r\n\r\n1971-72 Estimates. Therefore, Sir, it would  appear\r\n\r\nfrom the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Culture that his Ministry  is\r\n\r\nwell  aware  of the fact that the National  Theatre\r\n\r\nTrust is doing quite well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I too share the concern of the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jurong that the Government should  give\r\n\r\nmore  financial help to cultural organisations,  so\r\n\r\nthat we could eventually evolve a national identity\r\n\r\nin our national culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the\r\n\r\nsentiments of both the Member for Punggol  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Jurong.

Our opinion is that while the sum may  not\r\n\r\nbe  enough  to cover everything, it does  at  least\r\n\r\ngive  encouragement  to cultural  organisations  to\r\n\r\ninitiate   their  cultural  activities.   Moreover,\r\n\r\nculture  cannot  he fostered from  above.  It  must\r\n\r\nspring from the grass-root level. We can only  give\r\n\r\nencouragement.

It was decided that Singapore's cost  of\r\n\r\nparticipation of US$2,000 would be drawn  from  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  Fund and the rest of the cost, estimated  at\r\n\r\nabout US$18,000, would come from other sources. The\r\n\r\nstatement of accounts for this project has not been\r\n\r\nfinalised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there were project tours of\r\n\r\ntelecommunications experts, international telephone\r\n\r\noperators and satellite earth station engineers and\r\n\r\ntechnicians. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestimated  cost  of  the  project  per  country  is\r\n\r\nUS$5,940. While the statement of accounts  for  the\r\n\r\nproject has not been finalised, the actual cost  to\r\n\r\nSingapore is expected to be substantially less than\r\n\r\nwhat I have given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another four project tours of civil aviation\r\n\r\nexperts have been planned with a budget of US$4,260\r\n\r\nper  country.  A tourism marketing  plan  has  been\r\n\r\nplanned  for  1972 with a budget of  US$50,000  per\r\n\r\ncountry.  For  1973,  our  contribution   will   be\r\n\r\nUS$100,000 per country, thereafter increasing by 20\r\n\r\nper cent per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are contributions to the Fund by\r\n\r\nmember-countries. The Fund totalling  US$5  million\r\n\r\nis  made  up of contributions of US$1 million  from\r\n\r\neach member-country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for benefits - direct or indirect - to\r\n\r\nSingapore  from participation in the  projects,  it\r\n\r\nwould be really difficult to measure the extent  of\r\n\r\nbenefits  in anything which is cultural by  nature.\r\n\r\nBut if this will satisfy the Member, I can say that\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN  theme music will be used  to  introduce\r\n\r\njoint-ASEAN radio and T.V, programmes and at  ASEAN\r\n\r\nfunctions whenever they are held. It will serve  to\r\n\r\ngive the Association of South-East Asian Nations  a\r\n\r\nregional identity of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project tours of civil aviation experts,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications experts, international telephone\r\n\r\noperators and satellite earth station engineers and\r\n\r\ntechnicians were organised to carry out a survey of\r\n\r\noperational and other facilities available in  each\r\n\r\ncountry  with a view to co-ordinating the  services\r\n\r\namong  member-countries. It is envisaged that their\r\n\r\nfindings would result in better services within the\r\n\r\nregion.  Singapore's participation in  the  Jakarta\r\n\r\nFair  is  in  support  of the decision  of  member-countries to promote trade and commerce of  member-\r\n\r\ncountries  jointly. As for tourism marketing  plan,\r\n\r\nit is a follow-up of the \"Visit ASEAN Year\" held in\r\n\r\n1971  for publicity and promotion campaigns and  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to  boost  tourism  in  the  region  from\r\n\r\nEurope,  the  United  States  of  America,   Japan,\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund may be used only for the purposes of\r\n\r\nimplementing projects which have been  approved  by\r\n\r\nthe  Foreign Ministers of ASEAN and, in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the rules governing the control, disbursement\r\n\r\nand  accounting of the Fund.

I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  agree  with me  that  the  existing\r\n\r\nsocieties in Singapore play a very important\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart  in  our efforts to build a closely-knit\r\n\r\nsociety.  The Minister should be aware  that  these\r\n\r\nsocieties  are organised on a voluntary  basis  and\r\n\r\ndepend  on their members' subscriptions and  public\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these societies are going to raise funds for\r\n\r\nthe   construction  of  their   premises   or   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of scholarships or other  meaningful\r\n\r\nprojects,  they  will have to  carry  out  a  fund-raising campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from what I know a large -proportion of\r\n\r\nthese  funds which the societies have raised  after\r\n\r\ngreat  pains and efforts goes to the Inland Revenue\r\n\r\nDepartment  in the form of income tax.  Since  they\r\n\r\nare  working for public good or charity, this  tax,\r\n\r\nin fact, serves to discourage them to continue with\r\n\r\ntheir efforts. I think the tax measure is not fair,\r\n\r\nand  should be abolished. Income tax should not  be\r\n\r\nlevied  on  societies. If these  societies  can  be\r\n\r\nexempted  from  tax,  then  they  will  be  greatly\r\n\r\nencouraged to carry out their meaningful activities\r\n\r\n-for  the  welfare of the public. This,  I  believe\r\n\r\nwill  be  of great benefit to our society  and  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, not all voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  registered under the  Societies  Act\r\n\r\nare  subject to income tax. Voluntary organisations\r\n\r\nwhich are charitable in nature and are organised to\r\n\r\nrelieve distress, to advance science and education,\r\n\r\nor  to promote health or services conducive to  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the public as a whole, are exempted from\r\n\r\nincome   tax.   These  organisations  include   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Singapore\r\n\r\nAssociation for the Blind, Singapore Arts  Council,\r\n\r\nSociety  for the Aged, and many others.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  voluntary organisations which are formed  to\r\n\r\nserve  a more sectional interest and which  do  not\r\n\r\ncover  the well-being of the community in  general.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not appropriate to subsidise such\r\n\r\norganisations through income tax exemption, as they\r\n\r\ndo  not  serve the community at large  and  do  not\r\n\r\ncomply  with  the  requirements  for  a  charitable\r\n\r\norganisation. The tax liability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof such organisations depends on the ratio  of\r\n\r\ntheir  income from members or non-members. If  more\r\n\r\nthan half its income is from members, then it would\r\n\r\nnot  be liable to tax, but if more than half of its\r\n\r\nincome  is from non-members, then it will be liable\r\n\r\nto  tax.  To  suggest that voluntary  organisations\r\n\r\nshould  one and all be exempted from income tax  is\r\n\r\nto  invite tax evasion, as potential taxpayers will\r\n\r\nsoon    run    their   businesses   as    voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the Member's suggestion that\r\n\r\ncertain  projects  run by voluntary  organisations,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  an education fund, be exempted  from\r\n\r\nincome tax, if such an education fund is, in  fact,\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of the community at large and  not\r\n\r\njust   covering  sectional  interest,  it  can   be\r\n\r\nexempted from income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  there is one matter  which  is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. The Government has just  set  up  the\r\n\r\nNational Sports Promotion Board for the purpose  of\r\n\r\npromoting  sports  activities in our  country.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has also given some money as  financial\r\n\r\nassistance to the other sports organisations in our\r\n\r\ncountry.

A radio set, as we  understand,\r\n\r\nis  a  broadcast  sound  receiver  used  for  aural\r\n\r\nreception of broadcast matters transmitted by radio\r\n\r\nwaves,  wire or cable; whereas a television set  is\r\n\r\na, broadcast television receiver capable of  aural\r\n\r\nas well as visual reception of broadcast matters by\r\n\r\nradio  waves,  wire or cable. The only  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  the two is the visual or picture reception\r\n\r\nin  a television set. The common feature in both is\r\n\r\nthe aural or sound reception. A fee of $12 per year\r\n\r\nis charged for sound reception in a radio set or in\r\n\r\na   television  set  or  both.  However,   as   the\r\n\r\ntelevision   set  is  also  capable  of   receiving\r\n\r\npictures,  it  is charged an extra  $24  per  year.\r\n\r\nThus,  the licence fee for a radio set is  $12  per\r\n\r\nyear,  and that for a television set $36 per  year.\r\n\r\nIt is still\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$36  per year for both a television set and a radio\r\n\r\nset,  or  for  that matter two or even three  radio\r\n\r\nsets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

May I know what steps are being taken  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  such tax dodgers do pay  their  taxes\r\n\r\neither by extradition or other means?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the Anti-Evasion Unit\r\n\r\nbecame  operational in 1970, and in  that  year  it\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  completed  investigations  into   107\r\n\r\ncases. In 1971, the Unit succeeded in dealing  with\r\n\r\n136  cases. The amount of income tax and  penalties\r\n\r\nrecovered  was  $3.9  million in  1970,  and  $11.6\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1971. I am afraid, Mr Speaker, Sir,  at\r\n\r\nthe moment I do not have the figures for the number\r\n\r\nof cases prosecuted in court and also those settled\r\n\r\nout of court. However, if the Member is interested,\r\n\r\nI will be happy to supply him with the figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have been taken to ensure that taxpayers do\r\n\r\nnot escape tax by going overseas - for example,  by\r\n\r\nwithholding their passports as soon as  we  have  a\r\n\r\ndefinite case of tax liability. However, in, cases\r\n\r\nwhere taxpayers are already abroad, I am afraid  it\r\n\r\nis  not  possible to extradite the taxpayer because\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  revenue case and extradition  is  only\r\n\r\napplicable in criminal cases. I want to  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  as  a  result of the work of the Anti-Evasion\r\n\r\nUnit,  this  operation has also  helped  to  induce\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  voluntarily to make  more  accurate  and\r\n\r\ncomplete   returns  and  to  pay  their  taxes   in\r\n\r\naccordance with their true incomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am indeed grateful to the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State for his reply, and am  anxiously\r\n\r\nwaiting for the figures which I have asked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of those taxpayers who are\r\n\r\nabroad,  I  am  surprised to  hear  that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  we  can do about it. Surely  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nconcerned can look into this matter. I am told that\r\n\r\nthose taxpayers who are abroad have got large  sums\r\n\r\nof money for which they have got to account for and\r\n\r\nfor which they have to pay taxes.

However, if we can trace or  find  out\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  any property in the  name  of  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer who has gone abroad, such property can  be\r\n\r\nproceeded against for the recovery of tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, that explanation is quite\r\n\r\nirrelevant,  because  the  Anti-Evasion  Unit   was\r\n\r\nprimarily  established  for  two  reasons:  (1)  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate into cases, and (2) to try and  recover\r\n\r\ntaxes. If it is a case in reverse, I would ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Finance whether this Unit  is\r\n\r\nable to locate the persons who should have declared\r\n\r\ntheir  properties, sources of income, etc., to  the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Department but had not done so. I myself\r\n\r\ndo  not  know.  But  surely his  department,  being\r\n\r\nprimarily concerned with this problem should  know.\r\n\r\nThere  was  an article in the newspapers  not  very\r\n\r\nlong  ago that certain persons whom the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment were looking for, had left Singapore. It\r\n\r\nis possible that the Extradition Act might not have\r\n\r\nany  provisions to act in cases of this nature, and\r\n\r\nif  that  is so, could they not be included?  After\r\n\r\nall, the Minister of State for Finance is a learned\r\n\r\nman,  and therefore, Sir, he could consider my very\r\n\r\nhumble  suggestion and take it up with  authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned.  That being the case, Sir, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  close the debate on this topic, and I beg leave\r\n\r\nto withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $6,586,780 for Head 1306 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0901 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead l00l*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Yeo Choo Kok, Ho Kah Leong, Low Yong Nguan, and P. Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past year, the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nhas  undoubtedly  contributed tremendously  to  the\r\n\r\npromotion of healthy cultural activities. It has  a\r\n\r\ncreditable  record  of achievement,  by  organising\r\n\r\ncultural  nights, concerts, solos, and monthly  art\r\n\r\nexhibitions  in  the various community  centres  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  Ministry of  Culture  has,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  brought  art and culture to the  grass-root\r\n\r\nlevel.  Sir,  it  has  also  recently  organised  a\r\n\r\ncultural   mission  to  participate  in  the   arts\r\n\r\nfestival in Adelaide, South Australia. Through this\r\n\r\ncultural  mission,  it  has  publicised  the   fine\r\n\r\ncultural  traditions of Singapore. The mission  was\r\n\r\nvery  well received and applauded by the people  of\r\n\r\nAustralia. This is indeed a great encouragement  to\r\n\r\nthe cultural workers and artistes of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the cultural mission has a very\r\n\r\nhigh  standard of performance. I attended  a  dress\r\n\r\nrehearsal  of  this cultural group at the  Victoria\r\n\r\nTheatre on the eve of their departure. They put  up\r\n\r\na  very  good  and  tight programme  consisting  of\r\n\r\nMalay,   Chinese  and  Indian  traditional  dances,\r\n\r\nincluding a lion dance and ballet. All the artistes\r\n\r\nwho  took  part in the show had high standards  and\r\n\r\nput  up a spectacular performance. It is no wonder,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  they received such  a  tremendous\r\n\r\napplause in South Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the splendid performance by our cultural\r\n\r\nmission  has  rebutted  the wrong  conception  that\r\n\r\nlocal  artistes  are  not up to  standard  and  has\r\n\r\nstrengthened  the confidence of local artistes  and\r\n\r\ncultural  workers.  In order that  our  people,  in\r\n\r\ngeneral, will be able to enjoy such cultural  shows\r\n\r\nby  the  mission, I would like to  propose  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned to allow the mission to  perform\r\n\r\nin the rural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nareas to promote healthy cultural activities. These\r\n\r\nshows  can  be held regularly at parks or community\r\n\r\ncentres, and I am sure that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  give them a good reception. As you know, Sir,\r\n\r\nculture  and art play an important role  in  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding because they help to strengthen the morale\r\n\r\nof   our   people  an-d  also  inculcate   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness   and   patriotism.   Therefore   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture must actively  shoulder  this\r\n\r\nrole.  On  the other hand, it is also my hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  cultural  workers in Singapore will  similarly\r\n\r\nmatch the efforts of the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to suggest several proposals\r\n\r\nfor  the  consideration of the  Minister.  Sir,  to\r\n\r\nencourage more local artistes or cultural  workers,\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Culture  should  send  cultural\r\n\r\nmissions overseas more often, like the one we  sent\r\n\r\nto Adelaide in Australia. As a matter of fact, Sir,\r\n\r\nsending   cultural  missions  overseas  have   many\r\n\r\nadvantages.  On the one hand, we can publicise  our\r\n\r\nfine culture and art and, on the other hand, we can\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our friendly ties with other countries.\r\n\r\nWe  can  kill two birds with one stone. In view  of\r\n\r\nthis,  Sir, I would like to ask whether  this  year\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture has any plans to send  any\r\n\r\ncultural mission abroad. Secondly, Sir, in order to\r\n\r\npropagate our culture and art, I propose  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture should hold a massive cultural\r\n\r\nfestival  every  year. In fact, 1  have  made  this\r\n\r\nproposal  many  times over the past  few  years.  I\r\n\r\nremember  that, during the last Budget debate,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State concerned agreed that it  was  a\r\n\r\ngood  idea and he would consider it. One  year  has\r\n\r\npassed, and I would like to ask the Minister or the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary concerned what decision has\r\n\r\nbeen  arrived  at  regarding  the  organisation  of\r\n\r\ncultural  festivals in Singapore. May  I  have  his\r\n\r\nviews  on  this matter? Thirdly, I wish to  propose\r\n\r\nthe  setting up of a Cultural Fund. I remember this\r\n\r\nproposal  was also made last year and the  Minister\r\n\r\nin charge had agreed that a Cultural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFund be set up so that this would give an incentive\r\n\r\nto  our local talent. I do not know whether or  not\r\n\r\nthe  scheme for the setting up of the Cultural Fund\r\n\r\nhas-been implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we set up a Cultural Fund in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it  will  contribute  greatly  to   the\r\n\r\npromotion   of  cultural  activities.   From   this\r\n\r\nCultural  Fund we can also finance various cultural\r\n\r\nactivities  and  even  produce publications.  Local\r\n\r\ntalent will thus be encouraged and assisted. I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  will give serious  consideration  to\r\n\r\nthese proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nnot speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas  the  Member for Sembawang has pointed out  just\r\n\r\nnow   the   Ministry  of  Culture  has   a   record\r\n\r\nachievement last year in the promotion  of  healthy\r\n\r\ncultural activities. In this-respect, I wish to say\r\n\r\nthat the Minister for Culture himself has been very\r\n\r\nactive  in the cultural front. Although he has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able to participate in this debate  today,  I\r\n\r\nhave  to  show  my  appreciation for  his  efforts.\r\n\r\nThrough  his  hard  work we are  able  to  see  art\r\n\r\nexhibitions in the various community centres almost\r\n\r\nevery  week, and local artists are now able to  use\r\n\r\nthe  art  centre  at Outram3 Park  at  a  very  low\r\n\r\nrental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take this opportunity to make three\r\n\r\nproposals  to  the Parliamentary Secretary  in  the\r\n\r\nfield of cultural promotion? First, the setting  up\r\n\r\nof  a permanent Art Gallery. Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare  many  artists in Singapore. Many of  them  now\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  great reputation overseas. They are  well\r\n\r\nknown  not  only  locally but also internationally.\r\n\r\nHowever, so far there is no permanent place or  Art\r\n\r\nGallery   to  display  their  work.  Although   the\r\n\r\nproposal  to  build an Art Gallery  was  made  last\r\n\r\nyear,  so  far nothing has been done. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what\r\n\r\nprogress has been made-in this respect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next proposal is this. Will the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture ask for a piece of land to be used for  art\r\n\r\ndisplays in the open air? For example, we  can  ask\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome space along Queen Elizabeth Walk for our local\r\n\r\nartists  to  display their work in the  open.  This\r\n\r\nopen   air  art  exhibition  will  attract  foreign\r\n\r\ntourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion is whether the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCulture  will  seek  the assistance  of  the  other\r\n\r\nMinistries concerned to put up sculptural works  on\r\n\r\nour   traffic  islands.  The  traffic  islands  are\r\n\r\ndecorated only with plants and rocks. There are  no\r\n\r\nsculptures.  Apart from a few pieces of  rocks  and\r\n\r\nplants. I do not see any proper decoration  on  the\r\n\r\ntraffic islands, except one in Tiong Bahru. We have\r\n\r\nmany  sculptors in Singapore and we can  very  well\r\n\r\ndisplay their work on the traffic islands. We  have\r\n\r\nsome  well  known sculptors in Singapore,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture  can liaise  with  the  other\r\n\r\nMinistries  concerned so that the  traffic  islands\r\n\r\ncan be a venue for the display of statues and other\r\n\r\nsculptural works produced by our sculptors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think these proposals merit\r\n\r\nsome consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore\r\n\r\nthere   are  only  two  daily  issues  of   English\r\n\r\nnewspapers, one in the morning and the other in the\r\n\r\nafternoon.  These two issues are  produced  by  the\r\n\r\nsame  organisation. As a result, during the  recent\r\n\r\nStraits  Times strike the English speaking  members\r\n\r\nof  the  public were deprived of their daily  news.\r\n\r\nRadio   and   Television  Singapore  was   a   poor\r\n\r\nsubstitute.  Besides the short news  bulletins,  it\r\n\r\nfailed to keep the English speaking public properly\r\n\r\ninformed of local and world news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise one point in this House.\r\n\r\nLast  Monday in this House I spoke about the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  salary. I mentioned that  a  Minister's\r\n\r\nsalary  is $4,500. But I read in the Straits  Tunes\r\n\r\nthat it was reported as $4,200. I cannot blame  the\r\n\r\nreporters. They are very busy reporting the debates\r\n\r\nin Parliament. Most probably the correct figure was\r\n\r\nleft  out. However, the vernacular papers  reported\r\n\r\nas  $4,500. Only the English paper reported  it  as\r\n\r\n$4,200.  I  do not want to blame the reporters  and\r\n\r\nthe newspapers. But the people of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  be  made aware of what is happening  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture  that  he should request the newspapers  to\r\n\r\ncarry  more Singapore news instead of foreign news.\r\n\r\nI   cannot   blame  the  reporters;  otherwise   in\r\n\r\ntomorrow's  issue,  I  will  find  that  they  have\r\n\r\nreported me differently. Instead of P. Govindaswamy\r\n\r\nspeaking, they might print as \"Govindasamy\".  I  do\r\n\r\nnot want that to happen. I am just mentioning it in\r\n\r\nthis House hoping that they will verify their news,\r\n\r\nand will not allow such things to happen again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first\r\n\r\nof  all,  I  wish to thank the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nfor all the nice things he has said, especially  on\r\n\r\nthe success of our cultural mission to Adelaide.  I\r\n\r\nappreciate the compliments made by him. Now he  has\r\n\r\nalso   advocated  the  sending  of  more   cultural\r\n\r\ndelegations aboard. I share with him the hope that,\r\n\r\nwith  further  effort  and planning  by  all  those\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the performing arts and  with  some\r\n\r\nfinancial  support from Government and the  public,\r\n\r\nwe can send more cultural troupes abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier in replying to a question\r\n\r\nraised  by  the Member for Jurong, my  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nconsidering  how  best  to organise  more  cultural\r\n\r\nmissions  overseas.  Now that we  have  a  cultural\r\n\r\ntroupe   which   has  successfully   performed   in\r\n\r\nAdelaide,  this  can  form  the  nucleus  of   such\r\n\r\ncultural  troupes.  With  the  valuable  experience\r\n\r\ngained  particularly in meeting  all  the  problems\r\n\r\ninvolved in the preparation of a cultural troupe of\r\n\r\nthis  nature,  and possibly also, in  general,  the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a dance company, we are now  in  a\r\n\r\nbetter position to consider how best Singapore  can\r\n\r\nbegin  to  form  either a strong  amateur  cultural\r\n\r\ngroup  or a modest semi-professional dance company,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  give cultural performances  abroad  as\r\n\r\nwell as locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Sembawang also suggested\r\n\r\nthat  cultural troupes should give performances  at\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres so that the people will  have  a\r\n\r\nchance to see cultural shows, thereby\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  number of cultural  activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  in this case, the performing  arts.

There are\r\n\r\nno specific plans to organise cultural festivals at\r\n\r\nthe  moment.  However, in view  of  the  tremendous\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  the cultural mission to  the  Adelaide\r\n\r\nCultural  Festival, serious consideration is  being\r\n\r\ngiven  to further develop our cultural performances\r\n\r\nand  to  organise more cultural troupes. This  will\r\n\r\nmean  greater expenditure. I have no doubt that  at\r\n\r\nthe  right  time  provision will be  voted  for  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested that a Cultural Fund should\r\n\r\nbe  set up so that any moneys collected can be used\r\n\r\nto  finance various cultural organisations  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  to  carry out their cultural  activities.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  good suggestion, and I can assure  him\r\n\r\nthat we will look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of a permanent Art Gallery raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for  Jurong,  at  the  moment  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Culture  is  finalising   plans   to\r\n\r\nestablish  an  Art  Gallery to  be  housed  in  the\r\n\r\nNational Museum building. This Art Gallery will  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  be  of considerable interest to  both  local\r\n\r\nvisitors  and overseas tourists. With the reversion\r\n\r\nof  the  National Museum to the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nfrom 1st April, 1972, we intend to convert the back\r\n\r\nportion of the National Museum building into an Art\r\n\r\nGallery.  In  this connection, the  Singapore  Arts\r\n\r\nCouncil  has  made an offer to contribute  $650.000\r\n\r\ntowards  the  conversion. The proposed Art  Gallery\r\n\r\nwill provide facilities for a permanent display  of\r\n\r\nabout  150  paintings and sculptures on a  rotation\r\n\r\nbasis.   Facilities  will  also  be  provided   for\r\n\r\ntemporary art exhibitions and the sale of paintings\r\n\r\nand  sculptures. In addition, there will also be  a\r\n\r\nsmall multi-purpose theatrette for about 150 to 200\r\n\r\npersons so that all those who are involved  in  the\r\n\r\nvisual and the performing arts can make use of this\r\n\r\ntheatrette for their cultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Art Gallery should not only be a display\r\n\r\ncentre  but  also a focus of dynamic  and  forward-looking  activities  in  the  field  of  the  arts,\r\n\r\nespecially among the younger generation. As I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier,  plans are now  being  finalised  to\r\n\r\nestablish the Art Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's other proposals that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  should try to get a piece of  land  along\r\n\r\nthe  Queen  Elizabeth Walk area for the purpose  of\r\n\r\nholding art exhibitions in the open and also to put\r\n\r\nup  sculptures on traffic islands, I am taking note\r\n\r\nof  his  proposals and will let  him  know  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopments in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned that when the\r\n\r\nstaff  of  the Straits Times Group went on  strike,\r\n\r\nthere  were no English and Malay newspapers  during\r\n\r\nthe  period  of the strike, except for Chinese  and\r\n\r\nTamil   newspapers.  And  the  Member   experienced\r\n\r\ndifficulty  during that period and  suggested  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Culture should issue bulletins  in\r\n\r\nthe absence of newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff of the Straits Times Group went on\r\n\r\nstrike  from  24th to 31st December,  1971.  During\r\n\r\nthis   period,  the  English  and  Malay   educated\r\n\r\nsegments of the population were deprived of printed\r\n\r\nnews. Apart from Chinese and Tamil newspapers,  the\r\n\r\nonly other source of Malay and English news was the\r\n\r\nradio   and   television.  Radio   and   Television\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  the  time gave greater  coverage  to\r\n\r\nlocal and foreign news. The strike mentioned was of\r\n\r\nvery  short duration. Had it continued, steps would\r\n\r\nhave been taken to remedy the position. As a matter\r\n\r\nof interest, certain measures were being considered\r\n\r\nto  provide for such a situation should it occur in\r\n\r\nthe future. All newspapers in Singapore are run  by\r\n\r\nprivate  concerns.  Although local  newspapers  are\r\n\r\nlicensed by my Ministry, there is no press  control\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and the policy of the newspapers  is\r\n\r\ndictated   by   persons  owning  and  running   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  If the general public is  strongly  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  more  local news, then they  can  quite\r\n\r\neasily  make their opinions felt by writing to  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers in the man-in-the-street  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolumn  or  letters  to  the  editor\r\n\r\ncolumn.   There  is  no  doubt  that  any  socially\r\n\r\nresponsible  newspaper  will  respond  to  such   a\r\n\r\nreasonable   request  if  it   is   backed   by   a\r\n\r\npredominance  of its subscribers. I have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be the balancing factor  in  that\r\n\r\nother  subscribers will ask for more foreign  news.\r\n\r\nThen the newspapers concerned will have to strike a\r\n\r\nhappy  medium between the subscribers and  in  this\r\n\r\nway able to give the public what they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nthe   Parliamentary  Secretary  for  answering   my\r\n\r\nquestions.  But  there is one point  which  he  has\r\n\r\noverlooked.  He  only quoted what I  have  said.  I\r\n\r\nsuggested that the cultural mission should  perform\r\n\r\nin  the  various community centres.

I would imagine that there should  also\r\n\r\nbe  some  emphasis  on participation  in  art,  not\r\n\r\nmerely  on a passive spectator-approach to art.  In\r\n\r\nthat  respect,  I  think there  should  be  greater\r\n\r\nencouragement of response from schools. In relation\r\n\r\nto  this,  I  think  there  should  not  be  simply\r\n\r\nencouragement given to exhibitions or expression in\r\n\r\npaintings and other forms of art, but there  should\r\n\r\nbe some emphasis on art in relation to industry. In\r\n\r\nthis   way,  and  in  order  to  bring  about  this\r\n\r\nrelation,  there  are materials in the  forthcoming\r\n\r\nArt  Gallery  that  could  lend  themselves  to   a\r\n\r\nhighlighting of such a relationship between art and\r\n\r\nindustry.  By  placing emphasis on  this  relation,\r\n\r\nsuch as encouraging design competitions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetitions  in respect of motifs for  silverware,\r\n\r\nceramics, and so on, one can make this relationship\r\n\r\nclear, so that ultimately there may be some support\r\n\r\nfrom  the  industrial sector for this Art  Gallery,\r\n\r\nwhich otherwise would remain unrelated towards what\r\n\r\nis  going  on  around us. In respect  of  what  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary has also said  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be greater public support, I think the point\r\n\r\nthat I have made is relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I feel that Government should\r\n\r\nmore  actively  encourage  cultural  expression  in\r\n\r\ngeneral.  Ten  thousand dollars as contribution  to\r\n\r\ncultural  organisations, as we have heard  a  while\r\n\r\nago,  is  chicken-feed  in  relation  to  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State for Finance has said  regarding\r\n\r\ngrass-roots.  If you want to fertilise grass-roots,\r\n\r\n$10,000 will not be enough even for fertilisers  in\r\n\r\na  good  orchid  industry  in  Singapore!  I  would\r\n\r\nimagine  I have to give support to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  in any of its future attempt to  get  more\r\n\r\nmoney for the encouragement of arts in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  may  not  have\r\n\r\nanswered the questions of other Members but he  has\r\n\r\ngiven  me  a  satisfactory answer.

Previous to that, the  Theatre\r\n\r\nsection of the present building was built as a Town\r\n\r\nHall  in  1862.

Apart from the local training\r\n\r\nof  personnel,  it  will be  useful  to  send  them\r\n\r\nabroad,  or to take advantage of visiting  experts.\r\n\r\nThe    T.V.-radio   media,   as-entertainment   and\r\n\r\neducational media, are constantly undergoing  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges-and  are  exposed to  constant  changes  in\r\n\r\nstyle and selection of themes for presentation.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the\r\n\r\nBudget  session  last year, one  of  my  colleagues\r\n\r\nbrought up the question of late screening of  Tamil\r\n\r\nfilms  on  television  on  Thursdays  and  Fridays.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Tamil films are still being shown on  TV.\r\n\r\nevery  Thursday and Friday at 10 p.m, and not  many\r\n\r\npeople   have  the  opportunity  of  viewing   them\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.  In view of the fact  that  workers\r\n\r\nhave  to sleep early, is it not possible to  screen\r\n\r\nTamil  films  on Mondays and Tuesdays at  an  early\r\n\r\nhour? Surely this is not asking too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The F.M. Stereo section has failed miserably in\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not aware of the existence  of  stereo\r\n\r\nrecords  in Hindi and Tamil. It is high  time  that\r\n\r\nRadio  and  Television Singapore introduced  stereo\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  Indian listeners  too.  After  all\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  shortage of such  records,  if  only\r\n\r\nR.T.S, would make an effort to purchase them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, Sir, I would like to mention\r\n\r\nsomething   about  uniforms,  which  I  raised   in\r\n\r\nyesterday's Committee of Supply. Speaking  on  that\r\n\r\namendment. I had asked for something to be done  to\r\n\r\nthe  postal  uniforms to distinguish the  different\r\n\r\ngrades  of  officers. But the R.T.S, have  reported\r\n\r\nthat   Mr  N.  Govindasamy  had  said  that.   Most\r\n\r\nprobably,   all   the  reporters   think   that   P\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy  and N.

They\r\n\r\nmust  be very careful in their report, and also  to\r\n\r\nsee   to   the  need  for  Tamil  stereo   records.\r\n\r\nYesterday,  I  moved  an amendment  to  the  Postal\r\n\r\nServices.

Tomorrow, when I go  out  they\r\n\r\nmight ask, \"What have you done for us?\" And I  must\r\n\r\nhave  an answer. Therefore, I ask the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for Culture  to  rectify\r\n\r\nthis error. Do not let this kind of wrong reporting\r\n\r\nhappen again in future, i.e., reporting the speaker\r\n\r\nas N. Govindasamy instead of P. Govindaswamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

A   good\r\n\r\ninterviewer  is not made after attending  a  single\r\n\r\ncourse on the art of interviewing. He needs  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  time  to  build up confidence  and  to  gain\r\n\r\npractical experience. A follow-up of this programme\r\n\r\nhas  to  be done. We have also sent members of  the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting staff for training overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that there is room for improvement\r\n\r\nin  the  standard of interviewing by R.T.S, staff,\r\n\r\nincluding  its  news  reporters.  For  reasons   of\r\n\r\neconomy, R.T.S, do not recruit staff purely  to  do\r\n\r\ninterviews,  that is, they are employed  with  only\r\n\r\nthe qualifications for that specific job. To accept\r\n\r\nthe  proposal  that  we have  such  specialists  in\r\n\r\nR.T.S, would mean a radical change in staffing  and\r\n\r\nequipment,   with  a  corresponding   increase   in\r\n\r\nfinancial   provision.   R.T.S, announcers    and\r\n\r\nproducers  are  presently expected to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nannounce,  compere, read the news,  write  scripts,\r\n\r\nproduce  programmes, interview and  comment  either\r\n\r\nfor  radio  broadcasts or for  television,  or  for\r\n\r\nboth.  Some  of them do their jobs more competently\r\n\r\nthan others, while some are only able to do one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  of  these  jobs well. The same versatility  is\r\n\r\nexpected  of R.T.S, reporters, who also cover  both\r\n\r\nfor  radio  and  television. Persons  recruited  as\r\n\r\nR.T.S, reporters  generally have  no  journalistic\r\n\r\nexperience, and therefore they have first to  learn\r\n\r\nthe job about news reporting. Subsequently they are\r\n\r\nalso  expected  to do interviews for television  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  radio.  Here again, some  reporters  have\r\n\r\nshown  more  ability  in this  area  of  work  than\r\n\r\nothers. Courses in the art of interview have in the\r\n\r\npast   few  years  been  conducted  for  new  staff\r\n\r\nrecruited  for programme work. Since  last  year  a\r\n\r\nColombo  Plan expert for radio has been  conducting\r\n\r\ntraining  courses for the staff, which include  the\r\n\r\nart  of  interview.  This and  other  courses  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be held. Training for our reporters  in\r\n\r\nthis  field was started last month under a  Colombo\r\n\r\nPlan  expert for television. It is hoped that  such\r\n\r\nin-service  sessions will help improve the  quality\r\n\r\nof  interviewing for radio and television.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Member for Katong is satisfied with the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Anson's complaint\r\n\r\nabout  the Tamil programmes, R.T.S, do not telecast\r\n\r\nthe Tamil film either on Channel 5 or 8 on Mondays.\r\n\r\nTamil films usually appear as a regular feature  on\r\n\r\nChannel 8 on Thursdays at 9.45 p.m, and Fridays  at 10.00 p.m. There is, however, a light\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmusical    programme   in   Tamil   entitled    Nam\r\n\r\nIsainyarkal,  i.e.,  Our  Music  Makers,  which  is\r\n\r\ntelecast at 8.05 p.m, on Mondays on Channel 8.  For\r\n\r\nthe  Family In Tamil is telecast on Channel 8  at 8.45  p.m, on Wednesdays. Also on Channel 8 at 6.10\r\n\r\np.m, on  Saturdays there is a Tamil drama, Naadaga\r\n\r\nArangam.  On  Sundays,  a  variety  show,   Amuthum\r\n\r\nThenum,  is  telecast at 5.45 p.m. It can  be  seen\r\n\r\nfrom  this that Tamil programmes are evenly  spread\r\n\r\nthroughout  the week's hours of transmission,  with\r\n\r\nsome  programmes scheduled in early  evening  slots\r\n\r\nand  others a little later. This is also  the  case\r\n\r\nwith  programmes in the other languages. It is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  telecast programmes in  a  particular\r\n\r\nlanguage  only at peak hours. Because of  the  long\r\n\r\nunpredictable duration of full length Tamil films -\r\n\r\nI hope the Member for Anson takes note of this - it\r\n\r\nis difficult to schedule them between 6.00 p.m, and 9.50  p.m.  News telecast takes place  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod and this has to be at stipulated times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This includes accessibility of  the\r\n\r\nmobile  library  van  to  the  service  points   of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres. The van is a large vehicle  and\r\n\r\nrequires  a  fair amount of space for  parking  and\r\n\r\nmanoeuvring   around.

Because of the advances in  film\r\n\r\ntechniques,  we  can  see  the  performances   with\r\n\r\nrealistic  detail on the screen. This is  a  common\r\n\r\neveryday form of amusement indulged by the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, because of its extensive influence  over\r\n\r\ncinema-goers, we should exercise strict  censorship\r\n\r\non  them, so that those decadent, erotic, fantastic\r\n\r\nor  undesirable films shall not adversely influence\r\n\r\nour children and youths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although we have all along censored films,\r\n\r\nhowever, some films being exhibited in the  cinemas\r\n\r\nconsist  of  merely  cruelty,  violence  and  other\r\n\r\nundesirable themes, which will have adverse effects\r\n\r\non   our  young  people.  So  we  must  adopt  more\r\n\r\nstringent  measures in the censoring of  films.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  we should allow  more  films  of\r\n\r\nartistic  taste  and  educational  content  to   be\r\n\r\nimported  into Singapore, in order to  provide  our\r\n\r\npeople with more healthy and cultural films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that the Ministry of Culture\r\n\r\nhas  set up a film classification committee.  As  1\r\n\r\nunderstand it, the committee has already given  its\r\n\r\nrecommendation to the Minister. I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether any decision has been made  on\r\n\r\nfilm  classification. I personally do not agree  to\r\n\r\nfilm  classification because, in  my  opinion, our\r\n\r\npeople   would   all  like  to  see   healthy   and\r\n\r\neducational  films.  If  certain  films   are   not\r\n\r\nsuitable for screening to youths and children, then\r\n\r\nthey  belong to the bad category of films, in which\r\n\r\ncase,  even  adults should not see them.  What  the\r\n\r\npeople  want  is  the kind of  films  that  can  be\r\n\r\nenjoyed by the whole family. Therefore, I am of the\r\n\r\nopinion that we should not implement this system of\r\n\r\nfilm classification. According\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  my  information, the film classification system\r\n\r\nnow  being implemented in our neighbouring  country\r\n\r\nhas  aroused certain disturbances there. I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned  will take  note  of  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened in our neighbouring country in respect  of\r\n\r\nfilm classification before he makes his decision on\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture has always been very strict  in\r\n\r\ncensoring  violent  films, and  all  Chinese  films\r\n\r\nwhich show excessive violence are either banned  or\r\n\r\nappropriately censored before they are released for\r\n\r\npublic   exhibition.   As  a   result   of   strict\r\n\r\ncensorship, coupled with the change in the trend of\r\n\r\nproduction,  the  number of violent  Chinese  films\r\n\r\nreleased  for  public exhibition has  been  reduced\r\n\r\nconsiderably  in recent months. It  is  anticipated\r\n\r\nthat  this year's import of films of this  category\r\n\r\nby   local  distributors  will  be  lessened.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry   will   continue   to   exercise   strict\r\n\r\ncensorship  to  eliminate  scenes  of  callousness,\r\n\r\nviolence and bloodshed. As was pointed out  in  the\r\n\r\nlast Budget session, despite discussions among film\r\n\r\ndistributors, exhibitors and ordinary cinema-goers,\r\n\r\nthere  was  no definite consensus of opinion  among\r\n\r\nthe   parties  concerned  on  the  system  of  film\r\n\r\nclassification  and  whether or  not  a  particular\r\n\r\nsystem would definitely be better than the existing\r\n\r\nfilm censorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an advisory committee on film classification\r\n\r\nwas  set  up  by  the Minister in May  1971.  After\r\n\r\nconsidering its report, tt was considered that  the\r\n\r\nadvantages  accruing from classification  of  films\r\n\r\nwere  marginal as compared with the problems  which\r\n\r\nhave  to be overcome. Among these were the problems\r\n\r\nof enforcement and what may be termed the differing\r\n\r\nstandpoints of the different cultural groups, e.g.,\r\n\r\nvis-a-  vis-  risque scenes on the  one  hand,  and\r\n\r\nviolent  sword-fighting scenes  on  the  other.  No\r\n\r\ndecision  has, therefore, been taken as to  whether\r\n\r\nfilm  classification should be introduced  for  the\r\n\r\npresent. I hope I have answered the Member's  query\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, after\r\n\r\nhearing   the  reply  given  by  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,  I am not satisfied because he  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  specific  whether  his  department  wants  to\r\n\r\nimplement film classification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> As I said just now,\r\n\r\nthere   was   an   advisory   committee   on   film\r\n\r\nclassification headed by Dr Peter S.

The\r\n\r\ncommittee  has submitted a report which recommends,\r\n\r\namong   other   things,   that   a   simple    film\r\n\r\nclassification  system be introduced.

Owing to the difficulty of checking the\r\n\r\nages  of  audiences and the fact that the trend  of\r\n\r\nproducing pornographic films has declined  somewhat\r\n\r\nin  the  West,  most of our local film distributors\r\n\r\nand  exhibitors are not keen on film classification\r\n\r\nas   they  have  expressed  satisfaction  with  our\r\n\r\npresent censorship system.

I would imagine also that it would\r\n\r\nbe  good  if  the Education Officers of the  Museum\r\n\r\nstaff  could  organise  a special  section  in  the\r\n\r\nMuseum related to interests in art and craft in the\r\n\r\nschools, in the same way as such a section has been\r\n\r\norganised  with special attention to the  interests\r\n\r\nof  schools in natural history, especially as  laid\r\n\r\ndown  in the syllabuses for schools. It would be  a\r\n\r\ngood  idea  to emphasise early school  activity  in\r\n\r\nart,  both  in  the  primary and  later  stages  of\r\n\r\neducation  because a love for, and an interest  in,\r\n\r\nart must be inculcated at a very young age, and one\r\n\r\nwants  to tap the potential, at as early an age  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this special section to encourage art\r\n\r\nexpression   emanating  from  the  schools,   other\r\n\r\nactivities can also be carried out, like  seminars,\r\n\r\nfilm  shows, courses for art teachers, guided tours\r\n\r\nof the Museum itself, in such a way that a constant\r\n\r\nactivity is taking place, and that there is  not  a\r\n\r\npassive  response  to art. In as  much  as  I  have\r\n\r\nspoken   about  the  necessity  to  encourage   the\r\n\r\nindustrial and applied aspects of art, I hope  that\r\n\r\nwhere  schools  are concerned, every  encouragement\r\n\r\nwill  be given so that the function as well as  the\r\n\r\naesthetic  aspects of art could  be  emphasised  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  not only school children, but  the  Museum\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nfull  duties and functions of the Education Officer\r\n\r\nare:   the  conducting  of  tours  in  the   public\r\n\r\ngalleries and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlessons  in  the  school's museum;  organising  and\r\n\r\nconducting   regular  -  specialised  courses   for\r\n\r\nqualified  and  trainee  teachers;  selecting   and\r\n\r\nscreening    films    on   Saturdays;    organising\r\n\r\nillustrated  talks  and  demonstrations   to   Pre-University   and  upper  secondary   students   and\r\n\r\nteachers   once  a  month;  assisting  schools   to\r\n\r\nestablish  science  clubs  and  giving  illustrated\r\n\r\ntalks    and   demonstrations   to   these   clubs;\r\n\r\nsupervising the preparation of biological specimens\r\n\r\nfor loan to teachers; and organising special talks,\r\n\r\ndemonstrations  and  film shows  for  students  and\r\n\r\nteachers when requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member for Katong's suggestions that we\r\n\r\nshould  also  include all the other  aspects,  like\r\n\r\nart,  etc., I am sure we could look into  them.

Grand  Prix\r\n\r\nhas become a national event in Singapore and it  is\r\n\r\nparticipated   not   only   by   local   but   also\r\n\r\ninternational competitors. In fact, Sir, it is  one\r\n\r\nof the very few international sporting events which\r\n\r\nis  held  in  Singapore. Singapore has  a  rightful\r\n\r\nplace in the international motor racing calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, can we say that we have a suitable\r\n\r\ncircuit?  What  we need is a permanent  Grand  Prix\r\n\r\ncircuit, and this question was raised not less than\r\n\r\ntwice  previously.  Sir, though next  week's  Grand\r\n\r\nPrix  is  the  seventh in our series, we  have  had\r\n\r\nmotor  racing  events  for many  years.  The  local\r\n\r\nparticipants in the racing events are always  at  a\r\n\r\ndistinct  disadvantage because of  the  lack  of  a\r\n\r\npermanent  circuit  where  they  can  practise  and\r\n\r\ncompete  with  one another in order that  our  best\r\n\r\ntalents  can participate at the annual  Grand  Prix\r\n\r\nevent.   A   permanent  circuit  will  provide   an\r\n\r\nopportunity for our young speed enthusiasts to test\r\n\r\ntheir  skill and their motor cars or motor  cycles.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  it will also put an end to the  hide-and-seek that our young motorists are playing with  the\r\n\r\ntraffic police at odd hours in various places, like\r\n\r\nOrchard Road, Nicoll Highway, Nicoll Drive,  Jurong\r\n\r\nand  other venues. Our motorists and motor-cyclists\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  able to offer keen competition  to\r\n\r\ninternational  competitors in our Grand  Prix,  not\r\n\r\nbecause  they lack talent but because there  is  no\r\n\r\npermanent  circuit  where  they  can  practise  for\r\n\r\ncompetitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last March, Sir, our sporting Minister for Social\r\n\r\nAffairs  told us that a committee had been  set  up\r\n\r\nand  it had submitted a comprehensive report to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  an  alternative  site   and   other\r\n\r\nrequirements.  He  also told us that  the  proposed\r\n\r\nmulti-purpose  circuit would be in a good  location\r\n\r\nwith  scenic surroundings and away from residential\r\n\r\nareas.  He also told us that there would be  social\r\n\r\namenities  and  it  would  thus  become  a  tourist\r\n\r\nattraction. May I inquire what has become  of  this\r\n\r\ncommittee's report? It is high time we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  a  permanent racing circuit.

In  recent\r\n\r\nyears  sports  have  been  promoted  by  the   able\r\n\r\nleadership of the Social Affairs Ministry and great\r\n\r\nprogress has been made. The standard of the various\r\n\r\nkinds  of  sports has improved. There is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  sports play a very important role  in  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.  It is through organised activities  such\r\n\r\nas  sports  that we build a rugged society.  Sports\r\n\r\nmake  our  people physically strong  and  cultivate\r\n\r\ngood  moral virtues. Therefore, sports deserve  our\r\n\r\nclose  attention. I am sure we all agree  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Social Affairs has done a great deal in\r\n\r\nthe promotion of sports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Promotion Division has organised an\r\n\r\ninter-constituency soccer competition in  order  to\r\n\r\npopularise   sports.  In  order  to  support   this\r\n\r\ncompetition  the  Prime  Minister  has  donated   a\r\n\r\nChallenge Trophy. The Sports Promotion Division has\r\n\r\ndone  a great deal in the promotion of sports.  The\r\n\r\nobject  is  that  more people will  participate  in\r\n\r\nsports.  However, what I cannot understand is  that\r\n\r\nit  sometimes  does something which  obstructs  the\r\n\r\npromotion of sports, especially when it attempts to\r\n\r\nraise  funds  for the setting up of soccer  fields.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a soccer field in my constituency  which\r\n\r\nwas  handed  over  by  the  British  Armed  Forces.\r\n\r\nPreviously  it  was free for any football  team  to\r\n\r\npractise there, but now there is a charge of $5 per\r\n\r\nday  for  the use of this field. This has caused  a\r\n\r\nfinancial burden on the football teams which intend\r\n\r\nto  practise  there. I know that in  some  football\r\n\r\nfields  a charge of $2 is levied. In any case,  why\r\n\r\nis  it that for the Naval Base football field $5 is\r\n\r\nlevied  for  each  day? I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nreduce  this fee, or better still, make it free  of\r\n\r\ncharge.  This  will  encourage  everybody  to  play\r\n\r\nfootball and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandard of soccer will improve. I do not know what\r\n\r\nthe Minister thinks about this idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Blangah that my Ministry attaches\r\n\r\nthe   highest  priority  to  the  provision  of   a\r\n\r\npermanent Grand Prix circuit in Singapore. However,\r\n\r\nthe choice of a proper site and its availability in\r\n\r\nthe  context  of the general shortage of  land  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  purposes, besides the heavy  financial\r\n\r\ninvestment, are relevant considerations which  have\r\n\r\ndelayed  our decision to go ahead with the project.\r\n\r\nIt  is still under very active consideration  by  a\r\n\r\ncommittee with representations from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational  Development, the Ministry of Finance  and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Social Affairs, working  in  close\r\n\r\nconsultation with officials of the Singapore  Motor\r\n\r\nClub.  I  hope they will be able to finalise  their\r\n\r\ninvestigations and come to a definite conclusion in\r\n\r\nthe  not  too  distant future. It is  invidious  to\r\n\r\nencourage  motor racing in general, as  the  Member\r\n\r\nhas  said, and the annual Grand Prix in particular,\r\n\r\nwithout having a permanent circuit, but it must  be\r\n\r\nseen  within competing alternatives and  priorities\r\n\r\nfor  land and money. I am personally confident that\r\n\r\nwe will be able to resolve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the query raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang, the Sembawang football field is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  facilities recently handed over to us  by  the\r\n\r\nBritish Forces. The rental has been fixed at $5 per\r\n\r\nsession, and this is the normal payment far half  a\r\n\r\nday. This means that for such payment each side can\r\n\r\nplay  football for half a day if they want  to.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Member has said in other places, for  instance\r\n\r\nat  Farrer  Park,  the charge  for  the  use  of  a\r\n\r\nfootball field is only $2 per match. The fields  in\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park are heavily utilised and there can  be\r\n\r\ntwo or three matches on the field in one day. I  am\r\n\r\nafraid I cannot allow the use of the football field\r\n\r\nin  Sembawang without any charge, because there  is\r\n\r\nalways the question of maintenance. However, if the\r\n\r\nMember\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang still thinks that he cannot afford to\r\n\r\npay  the $5, he can always approach me and  I  will\r\n\r\nconsider his request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think the rental of $5 for the  use  of  a\r\n\r\nfootball field is not going to promote sports.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Social Affairs has adequate funds.  It\r\n\r\ncan  raise funds by various means, for example, the\r\n\r\nselling  of lucky draw tickets. He should  consider\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that many football teams  are  short  of\r\n\r\nfunds.  It is not only $5 which they have to  incur\r\n\r\nby  way of expenses. The players have also to spend\r\n\r\nmoney  on  drinks  and  refreshments,  laundry   of\r\n\r\njerseys  and uniforms. After the practice  session,\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  players  have  to  spend  money   on\r\n\r\ntransport. If we can allow these teams a  free  use\r\n\r\nof  the  football  field, this  will  serve  as  an\r\n\r\nencouragement  and more and more people  will  play\r\n\r\nfootball.

In previous  years,\r\n\r\nprospective  pilgrims  can  board  their  ships  at\r\n\r\nSingapore. But last year they had to go to the Port\r\n\r\nof Klang. They made no preparations for the trip to\r\n\r\nthe  Port of Klang as they were first scheduled  to\r\n\r\nboard  ship in Singapore. However, because of their\r\n\r\ngreat  desire  to  go  to  Mecca,  they  faced  the\r\n\r\nproblems  and difficulties with patience  and  with\r\n\r\nthe  full  conviction  that they  would  definitely\r\n\r\nreach the destination. To assist future pilgrims of\r\n\r\nSingapore, the President of the Majlis Ugama- Islam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  his  press  statement  recently  said  that   a\r\n\r\nPilgrimage  Fund would be established in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  would like to know what plans have been made  to\r\n\r\nassist  prospective pilgrims. To obtain the support\r\n\r\nof  Muslims  in Singapore, the Majlis  Ugama  Islam\r\n\r\nshould  make  the  scheme  attractive  and  provide\r\n\r\namenities  to the prospective pilgrims. Apart  from\r\n\r\nproviding   amenities  and   facilities   for   the\r\n\r\nprospective  pilgrims, the Majlis should  encourage\r\n\r\nMuslims   to  save  mores-  through  the   proposed\r\n\r\nPilgrimage  Fund for their journey to the  Haj,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they  would  have  to  face  all  sorts   of\r\n\r\ndifficulties in Mecca and N4edina, particularly  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of welfare and health. Many pilgrims  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  ignored by the pilgrim  agents  in\r\n\r\nMecca  who  have contacts with one or  two  pilgrim\r\n\r\nagents in Singapore. Most of the pilgrim agents are\r\n\r\nconcerned with their own welfare and with making  a\r\n\r\nlot  of profit. As such, it is important to provide\r\n\r\nassistance  and amenities to pilgrims of  Singapore\r\n\r\nat Mecca and Medina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another matter, which I would like to bring\r\n\r\nto  the  attention of this House is that the Majlis\r\n\r\nUgama  Islam  or  the Minister for  Social  Affairs\r\n\r\nshould consult the Central Provident Fund anti  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour to allow Muslims who  have  got\r\n\r\nfunds  in  the  CP.F, to withdraw  part  of  their\r\n\r\ncontributions and deposit it in the Pilgrimage Fund\r\n\r\nin  order  to enable them to go on a pilgrimage  to\r\n\r\nMecca. Sir, I would like to stress that it is  only\r\n\r\na  part  and not all of their contributions  or  an\r\n\r\namount which is sufficient for their fare to Mecca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the proposed Pilgrimage Fund will get\r\n\r\na  good response from Muslims in Singapore and,  in\r\n\r\nthis  way, will allow Muslims, while they are still\r\n\r\nyoung  and strong, to go to the Haj when  they  are\r\n\r\nfit to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know how many mosques\r\n\r\nand  suraus  are  under the administration  of  the\r\n\r\nMajlis?

The  Majlis'  plan  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   intended   to  help  Muslims   in   their\r\n\r\npilgrimage to Mecca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are actually two matters involved. Firstly,\r\n\r\nit  is the arrangement for charter flights to Mecca\r\n\r\nand,  secondly, the formation of a Pilgrimage  Fund\r\n\r\nor  Tabong  Haji.  Regarding the  proposed  charter\r\n\r\nflights,  the  Majlis  is  still  considering   the\r\n\r\nproject  and  there  is  a need  to  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nresponse  by  local  pilgrims through  registration\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be carried out soon. It  is  important\r\n\r\nthat  there must be a sufficient number of pilgrims\r\n\r\nwho  are interested in this project. Otherwise,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  worthwhile to embark upon  such  a  costly\r\n\r\nventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the formation of Tabong Haji, again\r\n\r\nthis depends upon the response\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Majlis can get from the Muslim public who\r\n\r\nwish   to   travel  to-Mecca  by  air.  Exploratory\r\n\r\ndiscussions are now being held with the experts  in\r\n\r\nthe  various fields and, as far as can be  gathered\r\n\r\nfrom  our preliminary discussions, there is  likely\r\n\r\nto  be  no difficulty in the establishment  of  the\r\n\r\nPilgrimage  Fund.  It must be recognised  that  the\r\n\r\nPilgrimage  Fund  serves a real  need  in  that  it\r\n\r\nensures that prospective pilgrims will save  enough\r\n\r\nmoney  for  the pilgrimage when they  register  for\r\n\r\npilgrimage by air, and it discourages the  practice\r\n\r\nof  selling  or mortgaging property to raise  money\r\n\r\nfor pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will be pleased to know that the\r\n\r\narrangement    for    pilgrimage    through     the\r\n\r\nestablishment of Tabong Haji or the Pilgrimage Fund\r\n\r\nwill  include-the provision of welfare  and  health\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  pilgrims during their  sojourn  in\r\n\r\nMecca,  Medina and Jeddah. The Pilgrimage Committee\r\n\r\nis considering the provision of medical facilities,\r\n\r\nincluding the services of a doctor and a nurse  for\r\n\r\nthe  pilgrims when they are in Mecca. The provision\r\n\r\nof  a  welfare  officer to look  into  the  welfare\r\n\r\naspects  of  the  pilgrims and the  services  of  a\r\n\r\nreputable pilgrim broker, and matters such  as  the\r\n\r\noffering of special gifts and life insurance, etc.,\r\n\r\nare also being looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the use of C.P.F, contributions by\r\n\r\nMuslim  contributors for the purpose of pilgrimage,\r\n\r\nthe  answer  has already been given before  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Labour. The basic aim of  the\r\n\r\nC.P.F, is to provide workers with some savings when\r\n\r\nthey  retire  from employment or when they  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  able  to work. To allow withdrawal  of  the\r\n\r\nmoney,  either  in full or in part, from  the  Fund\r\n\r\nbefore  a  member  is qualified for  withdrawal  in\r\n\r\norder to proceed on a pilgrimage to Mecca will  not\r\n\r\nbe  consistent  with  the purpose  for  which  the\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund was established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Section 74 (1) of the\r\n\r\nAdministration of Muslim Law Act, 1966, all mosques\r\n\r\nare now administered by the Majlis.

The Majlis has\r\n\r\nalready taken steps to ensure that all mosques  are\r\n\r\nproperly  managed.

As for  Naib\r\n\r\nKathis,  there  is a special -selection  committee,\r\n\r\ncomprising  representatives of the Majlis  and  the\r\n\r\nShariah Court, which select suitable candidates for\r\n\r\nappointment by the President of Singapore.

There  are  now  24  madrasahs  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  which  have  been registered  as  Islamic\r\n\r\nReligious Schools, of which 18 are under Government\r\n\r\ngrant-in-aid   and  six  private.  Two   of   these\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  are  running both primary and  secondary\r\n\r\nreligious  classes,  while the rest  are  providing\r\n\r\nprimary  education only. The subjects  provided  by\r\n\r\nthese  madrasahs  include  Koran  reading,  Islamic\r\n\r\nReligious  Knowledge, Arabic and  Malay  languages.\r\n\r\nThe  total enrolment of students attending  the  24\r\n\r\nmadrasahs  stands at 3,667. As for  the  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents   who   have  graduated   from   religious\r\n\r\nuniversities abroad, I would like to point out that\r\n\r\nsome  of  our  religious  students  go  for  higher\r\n\r\nstudies  at their own expense, while others proceed\r\n\r\nto  the  universities and then apply to the  Majlis\r\n\r\nfor scholarships.

The  general   public\r\n\r\nsomehow does not seem to be aware of the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  Legal Aid Bureau, apart from the normal  legal\r\n\r\naid,   does  also  undertake  cases  of  road   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents. There is also an unfortunate\r\n\r\nimpression that if they go to the Legal Aid Bureau,\r\n\r\nthe  result normally is rather slow. I do not  know\r\n\r\nhow  far  this is true, but that seems  to  be  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  impression. Perhaps it is because  of  the\r\n\r\ninadequacy  if  the Bureau that a great  number  of\r\n\r\nunfortunate   victims   of  road   and   industrial\r\n\r\naccidents  have.  I believe, become  easy  prey  to\r\n\r\nunscrupulous lawyers who have come to he  known  as\r\n\r\n\"ambulance chasers\". Once you are in the  hands  of\r\n\r\nsuch  operators  then,  by the  time  you  get  the\r\n\r\ncompensation,   that  is,  if  you   do   get   any\r\n\r\ncompensation, the amount of what you  are  entitled\r\n\r\nto  will  be reduced by about 40 to 50 per cent  or\r\n\r\neven  60 per cent. This matter does not come  under\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Social Affairs. Until such time  as\r\n\r\nwe  have  more  adequate measures  to  control  the\r\n\r\nactivities of such unscrupulous operators, I  think\r\n\r\none way we can go about it is to extend the service\r\n\r\nof  the  Legal Aid Bureau to help these unfortunate\r\n\r\nvictims of road and industrial accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I wanted to ask the same\r\n\r\nquestion as the Member for Jalan Kayu in respect of\r\n\r\nworkmen's   compensation  claims  that   might   be\r\n\r\nprocessed by the Legal Aid Bureau. Perhaps I  could\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister, therefore, to  quote  how  many\r\n\r\ninstances  of claims of such nature that the  Legal\r\n\r\nAid Bureau has succeeded in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As  no\r\n\r\nseparate   statistics  are   kept   of   industrial\r\n\r\naccidents,  it is not possible to give  the  actual\r\n\r\nnumber of applicants who have applied for aid under\r\n\r\nthis category under the heading of Accidents, which\r\n\r\ninclude  both  industrial and road  accidents,  the\r\n\r\nLegal  Aid Bureau dealt with 255 cases in 1970  and\r\n\r\n355 cases in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With record to industrial accidents, applicants\r\n\r\nwho  are  within  the  means test  commenced  their\r\n\r\nproceedings  with  the Legal  Aid  Bureau,  or  are\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  Bureau by the  Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nLabour.  The  referrals are only  cases  where  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour is of the  view  that  the\r\n\r\ncomplainants  have a reasonable  chance  to  pursue\r\n\r\ntheir  claims  at  common  1aw  on  the  ground  of\r\n\r\nnegligence,  or  cases  where  the  injuries   were\r\n\r\nsustained not in the course of employment.  In  die\r\n\r\nmajority  of  cases the Legal Aid Bureau  has  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful in obtaining compensation for  them.  In\r\n\r\ncases  where  there is no course of action  against\r\n\r\nemployers  for industrial matters, the  Bureau  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  able to obtain compensation on  an  ex-gratia  basis.

But today, after a lapse  of\r\n\r\ntwo  years,  nothing has been done at  all  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I also brought up the question of\r\n\r\nthe plight of farmers and fishermen in Singapore. I\r\n\r\npointed  out  that they are in a state of  hardship\r\n\r\nand   they   have  been  exploited  by   middlemen.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to help improve the lot of  the\r\n\r\nfishermen and farmers in Singapore which, in  fact,\r\n\r\nis   one  of  the  aims  of  the  P.A.P, socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment, it is perhaps time for us to  help  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  and  fishermen to set up co-operatives  so\r\n\r\nthat they may be freed of any exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will also recall that two years ago when\r\n\r\nthe  Minister replied to my question he pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  due  to the shortage of staff in the Registry\r\n\r\nof    Co-operative   Societies   and    to    other\r\n\r\ndifficulties, it was not possible at that  time  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  farmers and fishermen  to  organise  co-operative  societies.

Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when a co-operative thrift and loan society is self-\r\n\r\nsufficient  and has made great profits,  and  after\r\n\r\ncontributing  the  necessary 10  per  cent  of  its\r\n\r\ncapital into the statutory reserve funds and  other\r\n\r\nformalities, why does the Registrar object  to  the\r\n\r\nsociety's declaration of a dividend of six per cent\r\n\r\nfor  its  members? As a result of  this  objection,\r\n\r\nmany  members would feel that they are not  getting\r\n\r\nproper  returns  for the money they  have  invested\r\n\r\nbecause  other  financial organisations,  like  the\r\n\r\nbanks,  and  chit fund companies are paying  better\r\n\r\nreturns.  If members were to note that  it  is  not\r\n\r\neasy for a co-operative thrift and loan society  to\r\n\r\ndeclare  a  six  per cent dividend as  embodied  in\r\n\r\ntheir   rules  and  regulations,  I  will  not   be\r\n\r\nsurprised if a great majority of the members resign\r\n\r\nto   invest   their   money  in   other   financial\r\n\r\norganisations. Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay I suggest to the Minister to take a  look\r\n\r\ninto this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, previously when Singapore was\r\n\r\npart of Malaysia, the co-operative societies in our\r\n\r\ncountry  had been contributing a two per cent  levy\r\n\r\nto  the  Co-operative College  of  Malaya  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of co-operative education. Thereafter, when\r\n\r\nSingapore  separated from Malaysia,  this  two  per\r\n\r\ncent   contribution  to  the  Co-operative  College\r\n\r\nceased,  and  the  individual  societies  are   now\r\n\r\nholding  on to this co-operative education fund.  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether it is possible for legislation to be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  get  this two per  cent  levy  from\r\n\r\nindividual  co-operative movements  into  a  common\r\n\r\npool  and  to use it for co-operative education  in\r\n\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the idea of\r\n\r\nforming co-operatives for fishermen and farmers  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  new  one.  As  it is, the  Padang  Terbakar\r\n\r\nFishermen's  General  Purpose Co-operative  Society\r\n\r\nLtd, was  formed  in  1959.  Another  co-operative\r\n\r\nsociety,  the Punggol Co-operative Credit and  Fish\r\n\r\nMarketing Society Ltd., was formed in 1956: but  it\r\n\r\ndied  a  natural death four years later.  Five  co-operatives for farmers were formed between 1954 and\r\n\r\n1956,  one of which, the Jurong Road 14 m.s.  Rural\r\n\r\nCo-operative  Credit Society, still  exists  today.\r\n\r\nThese  co-operatives have, however, become inactive\r\n\r\nand  membership  is  poor: and their  members  give\r\n\r\nlittle  support  to the management. Leadership  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  most of the co-operative  societies\r\n\r\nare of a low standard, with the result that they do\r\n\r\nnot  function  properly and members  derive  little\r\n\r\nbenefit from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is merit in the establishment of co-operatives for fishermen and farmers at Jurong.\r\n\r\nInitially,  they can start on a modest scale.  They\r\n\r\nneed  not  be as elaborate as the co-operatives  in\r\n\r\nother countries. But the important thing is that co-operatives must be well managed and those concerned\r\n\r\nwith the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablishment  and  management  must  have  a  real\r\n\r\ninterest.  I am, therefore, inclined to favour  the\r\n\r\nformation  of such a co-operative by the  fishermen\r\n\r\nand  farmers  in  Jurong themselves.  I  think  the\r\n\r\ninitiative  must come from them. My Ministry  will,\r\n\r\nof  course,  provide  the  necessary  guidance  and\r\n\r\nprovision to ensure that the project launched  will\r\n\r\nbe  a viable one. If necessary, the Registry of Co-operative-Societies will also assist in the initial\r\n\r\nplanning  of  the  co-operative  and  provide'  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  training and education to build  up  the\r\n\r\nknowledge and experience required in the management\r\n\r\nof co-operatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson,   Sir,   under  the-Co-operative   Societies\r\n\r\n(Modification)   (Amendment)   Order,   1954,   co-operatives  are  not obliged to contribute  two-per\r\n\r\ncent  of  their  net  profits to  the  Co-operative\r\n\r\nCollege  of  Malaya.  However,  any  society  which\r\n\r\ncontributes two per cent of its profits to the  Co-operative   College   shall   be   exempted    from\r\n\r\nappropriating to its reserve fund for the  year  an\r\n\r\namount equal to the sum contributed to the College.\r\n\r\nFor example, a co-operative society is required  by\r\n\r\nlaw to-appropriate 25 per cent of its profits to  a\r\n\r\nreserve fund. If it contributes two per cent of its\r\n\r\nnet  profits to the Co-operative College of Malaya,\r\n\r\nthat co-operative society is allowed to appropriate\r\n\r\nonly  23 per cent of its net profits to the reserve\r\n\r\nfund.   If  there  is  an  alternative  educational\r\n\r\ninstitution engaged in the teaching of theory of co-operation  and  other  allied  subjects,  and   the\r\n\r\nadministration  is  run to the satisfaction  of  my\r\n\r\nMinistry, then my Ministry will consider making the\r\n\r\nnecessary amendment to the Order to channel the two\r\n\r\nper cent levy into such institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a co-operative society may declare and pay a\r\n\r\ndividend  of  six  per cent if it  contributes  the\r\n\r\nstatutory 25 per cent of its net profits  into  the\r\n\r\nreserve  fund.  Under  the  Co-operative  Societies\r\n\r\n(Modification) Order, 1954, a co-operative  society\r\n\r\nis allowed to appropriate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  to  10  per  cent of its net profits  into  the\r\n\r\nreserve  fund if it has been in existence for  more\r\n\r\nthan  10  years.  However, one  of  the  conditions\r\n\r\nattached to this reduction in appropriation is that\r\n\r\nthe rate of dividend on the subscription should not\r\n\r\nexceed  four per cent. This is because one  of  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  co-operatives  is  that  the  share\r\n\r\ncapital should only receive a strictly limited rate\r\n\r\nof  interest,  if any. A society which  contributes\r\n\r\nonly  10  per  cent  of its net  profits  into  the\r\n\r\nreserve fund is permitted to utilise the balance of\r\n\r\nthe 15 per cent only in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to reduce the interest on loans to members;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to create common-good funds:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to create building funds;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) for propaganda:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) for education; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) for any other similar purpose approved by\r\n\r\nthe Registrar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  his  reply,  the  Minister said  that  the  co-operative  societies  closed down  because  of   poor\r\n\r\nadministration  and management.  In  this  respect,\r\n\r\nSir, I think the responsibility should fall on  his\r\n\r\nMinistry.  We  know that all farmers and  fishermen\r\n\r\nare of comparatively low educational level and they\r\n\r\nlack    experience   in   organising   co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties.  As they also do not have  the  time  to\r\n\r\nengage  themselves fully in the activities  of  the\r\n\r\nsocieties,  so  the main bulk of the organisational\r\n\r\nwork  should fall on the shoulders of his Ministry.\r\n\r\nSince  the Minister has promised to assist in  this\r\n\r\nmatter, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,541,720 for Head 1001 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1002 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P.

It amounts to-$7.04 million,  which  is\r\n\r\nslightly  less than the allocation for  last  year.\r\n\r\nProbably  this  is  a reflection  of  the  economic\r\n\r\nprosperity  and increased employment  opportunities\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, resulting in a decline in the number\r\n\r\nof  poor people. Sir, a reduction in social welfare\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  a  normal sign.  If  there  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease,  it  can  be taken as  an  indication  of\r\n\r\nabnormality in our financial and economic position.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these remarks, Sir, it is still\r\n\r\nour  responsibility to look after the poor and  the\r\n\r\nneedy in our Republic. On this ground, I would like\r\n\r\nto  request the Minister concerned to increase  the\r\n\r\nfunds  for  public assistance, so that we  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  help  these  poor  and  needy  people  to\r\n\r\nsubsist. This is because during the period of price\r\n\r\nfluctuations,  the  cost  of  living  has  gone  up\r\n\r\nparticularly in respect of daily necessities. So if\r\n\r\npublic assistance is to be paid at the old rate  to\r\n\r\nthese  poor and needy people, then it will be  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  them to live at the  same  rate  of\r\n\r\nsubsistence. Furthermore, Sir, since we are  making\r\n\r\nconsiderable  progress in our economic  development\r\n\r\nwe   have   enough  funds  to  give   more   public\r\n\r\nassistance.  I  hope  the Minister  will  seriously\r\n\r\nconsider this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise with the Minister\r\n\r\nis  the  Boys' Homes. Mr Speaker, Sir, I  am  quite\r\n\r\nconcerned about the Boys' Homes. We know that these\r\n\r\nboys,  being  of tender age, have been misled,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore    kept   in   the   Boys'   Homes    for\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  and training. We should  give  them\r\n\r\nvocational  training in the Boys' Homes  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  when  they  leave these-Homes  they  will  be\r\n\r\nequipped  with a skill to earn their own living.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask  the  Minister  what  kind  of\r\n\r\ntraining  facilities are available in  the  various\r\n\r\nBoys' Homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with\r\n\r\nthe Member for Sembawang regarding the increase  in\r\n\r\npublic  assistance because the cost of  living  has\r\n\r\ngone  up. So the amount paid to the poor people  is\r\n\r\nnot  sufficient. The Minister will have to consider\r\n\r\nincreasing  public  assistance  to  those  who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  work, disabled persons, especially  the\r\n\r\nmedically unfit. I think this is a proper  time  to\r\n\r\nincrease public assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to bring a few points regarding\r\n\r\nthe   Woodlands  Home  for  the  Aged.  The  living\r\n\r\nconditions are bad. The old people are served  with\r\n\r\npoorly cooked food, There are a lot of bugs in  the\r\n\r\nbeds.  Toilet  facilities are  poor.  Most  of  the\r\n\r\ntoilets  are  dirty and damaged, and  the  flushing\r\n\r\nsystem is unsatisfactory. Despite the anti-mosquito\r\n\r\ncampaign,  there are a lot of mosquitoes and  flies\r\n\r\nin  the Home. Spot checks and investigations by the\r\n\r\nproper  authorities should be carried no  into  the\r\n\r\nold  people's  complaints. We  cannot  treat  these\r\n\r\npeople  as fourth-class citizens because  of  their\r\n\r\nage   and  neglect  them  completely.  I  was  also\r\n\r\ninformed  that  the inmates of the  Home  are  each\r\n\r\ngetting $4 as pocket money every month. But  I  was\r\n\r\ntold they have reduced it to only $1. Whether it is\r\n\r\ntrue  or  not  I  am not sure, but the  people  are\r\n\r\ngetting  $1 each. That also should be checked.  Now\r\n\r\nalthough we want to increase the pocket money  from\r\n\r\n$4  to  $6,  we cannot do so because  it  has  been\r\n\r\nreduced to SI. I do not know whether or not this is\r\n\r\ntrue.  I  hope  the Minister will  look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter and see whether there is a ruling on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> The Member for Sembawang, in\r\n\r\nmoving  his  amendment in respect of  the  subhead,\r\n\r\nDirector  of  Social Welfare, has  touched  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of Public Assistance. And since I have  an\r\n\r\namendment  in  respect  of  subhead  2061*,  Public Assistance, I am wondering if you \r\n\r\nwill permit me to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*  The amendment, standing in the names of Messrs Sim Boon Woo and Seah Mui Kok, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 2061.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeak on my amendment now, as it will be convenient\r\n\r\nfor the Minister to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> If Members care to look at\r\n\r\nsubhead  2061, they will observe that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nreduction of $600,000 in the provision as  compared\r\n\r\nwith fast year's estimates. This is because some of\r\n\r\nthe  recipients  of  public assistance  have  found\r\n\r\nemployment. I would like the Minister to re-examine\r\n\r\nthe  criteria  in deciding the quantum  of  payment\r\n\r\ngranted to recipients of public assistance, in view\r\n\r\nof the high cost of living today. I appreciate that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should not be too liberal or unduly\r\n\r\ngenerous in this particular form of social  welfare\r\n\r\nservice for it might encourage irresponsibility and\r\n\r\nindolence. However, I strongly feel that  in  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  the  recipients  are  not  employed  due  to\r\n\r\nillness,  old  age  or  handicapped,  consideration\r\n\r\nshould be given to the fact that the amount granted\r\n\r\nshould  be reasonably sufficient to enable them  to\r\n\r\nlive  a  reasonable  life.  Another  factor  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  in this respect is that  sonic  of  the\r\n\r\nrecipients may be employable but cannot take up any\r\n\r\nemployment  as  they have to perform the  necessary\r\n\r\ndomestic routine, for example, a widowed mother has\r\n\r\nto  look  after  their young children.  It  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, morally wrong for the otherwise able-bodied\r\n\r\npersons to live on welfare dole almost permanently,\r\n\r\nbut unfortunately the situation is such that it  is\r\n\r\nbeyond help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would request the Minister to conduct an\r\n\r\nimmediate  exercise to revise the rates  of  public\r\n\r\nassistance  allowances, taking  into  consideration\r\n\r\nthe   different  social  environment  and   today's\r\n\r\nminimum  standard  of  living.  Sir,  the  dreadful\r\n\r\nsituation  some of our public assistance recipients\r\n\r\nare  in cannot meet with our claim that we have the\r\n\r\nsecond highest per capita income in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,\r\n\r\nI originally intend to speak on my amendment* which\r\n\r\nwill  come  up later, but since other Members  have\r\n\r\nbeen  speaking on the same subject, I also wish  to\r\n\r\ntouch on it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The amendment, standing in the name of Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1151.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in December last year when I raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  public  assistance,  I  remember  the\r\n\r\nMinister   concerned  replied  that  his   Ministry\r\n\r\nproposed to ask the Ministry of Finance to increase\r\n\r\nthe  rates  of public assistance to those  families\r\n\r\nwho  needed  aid, and that the Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nwas  considering it. However, when we  examine  the\r\n\r\npresent  Budget we are rather disappointed, because\r\n\r\nwhile  we  are  able to give an additional  month's\r\n\r\nsalary  as  allowance  to our civil  servants,  the\r\n\r\npublic  assistance vote has not been  increased  as\r\n\r\nexpected,  but  instead  it  has  been  reduced  by\r\n\r\n$600,000  as compared with that of last year.  Does\r\n\r\nthat  imply that those recipients under the  scheme\r\n\r\nwill  get less financially? If I am not wrong, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe present public assistance scheme was formulated\r\n\r\nin 1962. According to this current scheme, a family\r\n\r\nreceiving public assistance could get a minimum  of\r\n\r\n$21  per month. The maximum should not be over $60.\r\n\r\nThese  were the rates fixed ten years ago. A decade\r\n\r\nhas  passed and our social environment has  changed\r\n\r\ntremendously. Our standard of living  is  now  much\r\n\r\nhigher than it was ten years ago. If the family  of\r\n\r\na recipient is staying in a Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard flat, the meagre sum of public assistance  is\r\n\r\nnot  sufficient even to meet the expenses for  rent\r\n\r\nand   P.U.B, charges,  not  to  mention  food  and\r\n\r\nsundries. The present amount is not sufficient as I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned earlier. In these circumstances,  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the Public Assistance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScheme will be of actual help to those who need  it\r\n\r\nunder  the  scheme.

The question  of\r\n\r\npublic  assistance must be reviewed in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  rate  to be given per month. As we  have  just\r\n\r\nheard  from the Member for Tiong Bahru, these rates\r\n\r\nof allowances are more than ten years old. In fact,\r\n\r\nif  we look around, much water has flowed under the\r\n\r\nMerdeka  Bridge  in the past ten  years!  Liken  to\r\n\r\nthat,  I  would  say that Ministers' salaries  have\r\n\r\nbeen increased from $2,500 to $4,500 per month; the\r\n\r\nallowance  to  each Member of Parliament  has  been\r\n\r\nraised   from  $500  to  $1,000  per   month.   The\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries and Ministers  of  State\r\n\r\nhave also had increases in allowances. Recently, it\r\n\r\nhas  been announced that one month's salary  as  an\r\n\r\nannual  allowance would be paid to civil  servants.\r\n\r\nNow we have these cases of poor people depending on\r\n\r\npublic assistance. An upward revision in the  rates\r\n\r\nis  long overdue. Why does the Minister for  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs  not take this into consideration?  Instead\r\n\r\nof   an  increase  in  the  allocation  for  public\r\n\r\nassistance, we see a decrease. In fact,  last  year\r\n\r\nin  this august Chamber, he assured the House  that\r\n\r\nhe  would  look into this matter. Does he  mean  to\r\n\r\ntell us that when he looks into a matter there will\r\n\r\nbe a reduction in the allowance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> There are less deserving cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> It may well be that there are\r\n\r\nless   deserving  cases.  But  if  we   have   five\r\n\r\nBackbenchers  standing up to say that  it  is  high\r\n\r\ntime the Minister revised the rates, there must  be\r\n\r\nsomething wrong somewhere. We do not come into this\r\n\r\nChamber  just to make noise and get some publicity.\r\n\r\nFar from it, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had occasion to meet cases of hardship. A\r\n\r\npoor washerwoman had come to me and said, \"Can  you\r\n\r\nplease  help me. The Public Assistance  Section  of\r\n\r\nthe  Social Welfare Department has now asked me  to\r\n\r\nrefund the allowance paid, and it has threatened to\r\n\r\ncut  the assistance.\" I asked her why, and what was\r\n\r\nthe  amount  she was given. She told  me  that  she\r\n\r\nreceived  only  a  small allowance  with  which  to\r\n\r\nsupport   so  many  children,  including   herself.\r\n\r\nTherefore, she said that she could not go on.  What\r\n\r\ncould  she do but to take up some additional  work.\r\n\r\nEven that does not help her much. However, whenever\r\n\r\nthe Social Welfare Department officials discover  a\r\n\r\ncase  whereby a recipient has found employment,  it\r\n\r\nwill  proceed to cut off the assistance. There were\r\n\r\nquite  a number of cases where the allowances  have\r\n\r\nbeen cut. I personally know of a lot of other cases\r\n\r\nwhere  the recipients turned to me and said, \"I  do\r\n\r\nnot want public assistance. This is bitter bread of\r\n\r\ncharity.  I  do  not  need  it.  What  I  want   is\r\n\r\nemployment.\" Unfortunately, Sir, both the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance and the Minister of State for  Finance\r\n\r\nare  not  here  in this Chamber, or  I  would  have\r\n\r\npressed  this  matter further. However,  Sir,  when\r\n\r\nthese  poor  recipients  go  and  register  at  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Exchange, they are found either too  old\r\n\r\nor maybe a little handicapped physically, and as  a\r\n\r\nresult  they cannot get employment. What  can  they\r\n\r\ndo?  Is  it not the responsibility of the State  to\r\n\r\nlook   after  these  poor  people?  A   good   many\r\n\r\nillustrations  have been given  in  this  House  in\r\n\r\nwhich the small amount\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  public assistance given is barely sufficient to\r\n\r\npay for rent and public utility services, let alone\r\n\r\nto subsist on it. I appreciate that there may be  a\r\n\r\nreduction in the number of cases, and the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  get  up to say that this is a good  sign.  At\r\n\r\nleast  I hope the Minister for Social Affairs  will\r\n\r\nconsider  the  matter. I am  not  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister is not considering it, but how much has he\r\n\r\nthought of it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Very much? But then why is there\r\n\r\na  reduction instead? This is the irony of  it.  He\r\n\r\nfought for it so hard that in the end the amount is\r\n\r\nreduced.  The  Minister for Finance has  painted  a\r\n\r\nvery  beautiful picture of the economic  growth  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Everything is going up. As I  have  said\r\n\r\nthe  other day, the Gross National Product is going\r\n\r\nup,  but how far it is going up I do not know.  But\r\n\r\nthen what about the people at the lower levels  who\r\n\r\ncannot and will never be able to catch up?

I  feel\r\n\r\nthat it is not only  the  rates  of public \r\n\r\nassistance allowances that need looking into\r\n\r\nbut  also  the rules. I have a case recently  of  a\r\n\r\nwoman  who  is  in  receipt  of  public  assistance\r\n\r\nallowance of $21 per month and as soon as she found\r\n\r\nherself  an  odd-job paying only $20, the  Ministry\r\n\r\npounced  on  her  straightaway  and  cut  off   the\r\n\r\nallowance by $10. I think this is extremely unfair.\r\n\r\nHow  can we expect a person to live on $31?  Surely\r\n\r\nit  is our policy to encourage them, no matter  how\r\n\r\nold  they  are,  to try to stand on their  own  two\r\n\r\nfeet,  And this is a case of a woman of  55  or  56\r\n\r\nyears of age.

I think the only case that we can  make\r\n\r\nagainst  raising the rates is making it  too  high.\r\n\r\nBut we are so far below the disincentive point that\r\n\r\nwe can safely proceed to double, if not triple, the\r\n\r\ncurrent rates. We must have in mind the people  who\r\n\r\nare  old, especially those who are decrepit.  As  I\r\n\r\npointed  out in the past, we are a rapidly changing\r\n\r\nsociety.  The traditional extended family has  been\r\n\r\nbreaking down. One of the effects of living in high-rise  modern-type  flats  is  the  breaking  up  of\r\n\r\nfamilies into smaller units. People no longer  stay\r\n\r\nwith or take care of their parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, as we modernise, as we build\r\n\r\nspanking new hotels, new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroads  and  so  on, I am afraid we are  restricting\r\n\r\noptions to people. The land for cultivating  simple\r\n\r\nthings  to  live on is shrinking. The opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  hawking are also shrinking. One has to  be  on\r\n\r\nthe  register of hawkers for the last two years  in\r\n\r\norder  to  qualify for a licence in a new  hawkers'\r\n\r\ncentre.  One cannot just go out and try to  make  a\r\n\r\nliving. One could get hauled up before a court  and\r\n\r\nfined  $5  for  the  first time and  $15  for  each\r\n\r\nsubsequent  offence.  We  are  trying  to  build  a\r\n\r\nmodern,  dynamic,  progressive society,  double  or\r\n\r\nquadruple  our national income. But,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  should  be a society  with  a  heart,  a\r\n\r\nsociety  that  does not neglect people  who  cannot\r\n\r\nkeep up with the competitive pace because they  are\r\n\r\nold,  decrepit  and because they  simply  lack  the\r\n\r\neducation  and  the skills to keep up  with  modern\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

This is due to a reduction\r\n\r\nin  the number of public assistance recipients. The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  public  assistance cases  has  shown  a\r\n\r\nsteady  decline from 27,435 cases in 1964 to  8,915\r\n\r\ncases  in  1971. Therefore, the provision  of  $2.8\r\n\r\nmillion for public assistance allowance under  item\r\n\r\n(1)  of  subhead  2061, Head 1002, in  the  1972-73\r\n\r\nEstimates  is  expected  to be  adequate,  provided\r\n\r\nthere  is no change in the existing rates of public\r\n\r\nassistance allowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the rules governing the public\r\n\r\nassistance scheme, they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndesigned  to assist those who are in real  need  of\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance. As the Member for Changi  has\r\n\r\nso  ably  put it, the quantum of payment should  neither  be  too liberal nor unduly generous  as  to\r\n\r\nencourage   irresponsibility  and  indolence.   The\r\n\r\nquantum of payment is based on the means test which\r\n\r\ntakes-   into  consideration  the  status  of   the\r\n\r\nrecipient according to the number of dependants  he\r\n\r\nhas.   In  administering  the  scheme,  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department has always seen to it that  the\r\n\r\ngenuine  cases  of  hardship are given  sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration  and, wherever necessary,  additional\r\n\r\nallowances,  payable under the other schemes,  such\r\n\r\nas  the Silver Jubilee Fund, will he given to  such\r\n\r\nhardship cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the upward revision of the present\r\n\r\nrates  of public assistance allowance, I am pleased\r\n\r\nto  inform the House that steps have, in tact, been\r\n\r\nactively taken to revise the rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

It will  take\r\n\r\ntoo  much time to describe all the training schemes\r\n\r\nthat  are  being provided. The Member may  wish  to\r\n\r\nknow that, apart from academic subjects, moral  and\r\n\r\nreligious     instruction,    physical    training,\r\n\r\nparticipation in uniformed groups, a wide range  of\r\n\r\nvocational   and  recreational  types  of   general\r\n\r\ncourses  are  also provided in the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nHomes.  The types and levels of such courses-  vary\r\n\r\nfrom  institution  to institution.  In  the  Gimson\r\n\r\nSchool for Boys, for example, courses include motor\r\n\r\nmechanics, electric wiring, metal craft, carpentry,\r\n\r\nhandicraft   work,   making   of   souvenirs    and\r\n\r\nsignboards,  noodle-making and cooking  (restaurant\r\n\r\nstyle).  In  the Mount Emily Girls'  Home,  on  the\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhand,  such courses as commercial laundry,  ladies'\r\n\r\nhair  dressing  and styling, sewing and  embroidery\r\n\r\nwork,  cake-making,  food catering  and  handicraft\r\n\r\nwork,  including the making of dolls, are provided.\r\n\r\nSuffice  it  for me to say, everything possible  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done to provide adequate and useful training\r\n\r\nfor  the boys and girls in Social Welfare Homes  so\r\n\r\nas  to  enable  them  to  fit  into  the  world  of\r\n\r\nemployment upon their discharge from the Homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Anson, it is indeed\r\n\r\ngratifying  to hear that he is so deeply  concerned\r\n\r\nwith the welfare of the old people at the Woodlands\r\n\r\nHome  for the Aged, which is now undergoing repairs\r\n\r\nand  renovations.  Four new  dormitories,  a  large\r\n\r\nworkshop,  and a recreational hall have  just  been\r\n\r\ncompleted,  and  workmen are  now  building  a  new\r\n\r\ndining hall and making improvements to the existing\r\n\r\nkitchen.  Repair  of  leakages in  water  cisterns,\r\n\r\npipes and taps, has been completed. Members of  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of Visitors appointed to inspect and  advise\r\n\r\non the running of this Home are generally satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the conditions and amenities in the Home.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Social  Welfare  Department  has  taken\r\n\r\nconsiderable pains to improve the amenities for the\r\n\r\nresidents.  For  example, several  television  sets\r\n\r\nhave recently been installed in the dormitories.  A\r\n\r\npergola  and a decorative fountain have  also  been\r\n\r\nconstructed  for  the enjoyment of  the  residents.\r\n\r\nThrough  the  combined efforts  of  the  staff  and\r\n\r\nresidents,  the Home, together with  its  extensive\r\n\r\ngrounds, has been kept quite clean and green. Flies\r\n\r\nand  mosquitoes  did present a problem  before,  in\r\n\r\nview  of the fact that the Home is located  in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity  of  animal  and  vegetable  farm   lands.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the Ministry of Health has already  taken\r\n\r\naction on the farm lands adjacent to the Home,  and\r\n\r\nthe situation has improved considerably. The health\r\n\r\nauthorities have also confirmed that there  are  no\r\n\r\nbreeding  grounds for flies and mosquitoes  in  the\r\n\r\nHome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware that the allowance for any inmates\r\n\r\nof  th-e Homes for the Aged has been reduced to $1.\r\n\r\nIf the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  can give me the  names  of  the\r\n\r\ninmates who have been paid an allowance of only  SI\r\n\r\nper  month.  I  will immediately have  their  cases\r\n\r\ninvestigated. Previously, aged residents its Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Homes were paid a fixed monthly  allowance\r\n\r\nof   $5  for  male  residents  and  $4  for  female\r\n\r\nresidents,  irrespective  of  their  conduct.   The\r\n\r\nsystem  has  led  to  abuse in  that  many  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents  failed  to comply with  the  regulations\r\n\r\nwhich  are  designed  for the-welfare  of  all  the\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to devise a system that encourages good\r\n\r\ndiscipline  and  order, a new  payment  system  was\r\n\r\nintroduced on the 1st August. 1969. Under this  new\r\n\r\nsystem,  the  residents  are classified  into-three\r\n\r\ngroups, according to their conduct and industry  in\r\n\r\nthe  homes  and  not  according  to  sex.  Grade  I\r\n\r\nresidents receive $10 per month; Grade II residents\r\n\r\n$5 per month, and Grade III residents $2 per month.\r\n\r\nIn  addition to that, an incentive scheme has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced  to  enable the  more  industrious\r\n\r\nresidents to share 50 per cent of the profits  from\r\n\r\nthe   sales  of  manufactured  articles  and  other\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to extend an\r\n\r\ninvitation  to all Members of Parliament  to  visit\r\n\r\nthe  Woodlands Home for the Aged at any time to see\r\n\r\nfor themselves the conditions existing therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary for his detailed reply.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of Mr J.

This subhead 2009  is\r\n\r\njust another relevant matter concerning the care of\r\n\r\nthe  old people in the Homes for the Aged. The  sum\r\n\r\nvoted  is to provide free coffins and free  burials\r\n\r\nto  the dead inmates of the Homes. I consider  this\r\n\r\nsum  too  meagre. I feel that the dead  inmates  in\r\n\r\nthese  Homes  are  given  something  worse  than  a\r\n\r\npauper's  burial. I wish to appeal to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor an exercise in this provision. So much money is\r\n\r\nbeing   spent   on  less  important  matters,   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we should not save on our last  services\r\n\r\nto  the dead. Therefore, I advocate for an increase\r\n\r\nfor this subhead in next year's budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Sir, I agree with the\r\n\r\nsentiments expressed by the Member for Mountbatten.\r\n\r\nEvery effort is being made to ensure that the  poor\r\n\r\nold  people in the Homes are given a decent burial.\r\n\r\nThe  provision of $200 under subhead 2009  is  also\r\n\r\nused  to meet the cost of burial in those cases  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  dead  bodies are sent to  the  hospital\r\n\r\nmortuary.  It  is  the  normal  practice  for  such\r\n\r\nburials  to be undertaken by an approved contractor\r\n\r\nat  the  same  rates as those payable  in  hospital\r\n\r\ncases.  Expenditure under this subhead  during  the\r\n\r\nlast two financial years had not exceeded $100  per\r\n\r\nyear.   Therefore,  the  provision   of   5200   is\r\n\r\nconsidered adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial grants for burials for other cases are\r\n\r\nnormally  paid  from  either the  Cheang  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nBurial  Ground  Charity Fund or the Silver  Jubilee\r\n\r\nFund.  There  is also a provision of  $3,000  under\r\n\r\nsubhead 2061, item (4), to cover burial subsidy for\r\n\r\nMalay  families  affected by  development  schemes.\r\n\r\nThus the Social Welfare Department, in fact, has  a\r\n\r\nBurial  fund  at  its  disposal  to  assist  -needy\r\n\r\nfamilies to defray their funeral expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I am glad that the Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department has other funds at its disposal.\r\n\r\nIn view of this, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $7,042,660 for Head 1002 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1003 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of\r\n\r\nMessrs Teong Eng Siong, N.
