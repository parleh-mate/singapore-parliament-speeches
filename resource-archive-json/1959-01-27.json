But the point I would like to  emphasise\r\n\r\nis  that these election results give an ironical proof\r\n\r\nthat  we  have to rectify the not fully representative\r\n\r\nnature  of a Government or any authority which  arises\r\n\r\nfrom optional voting. We are going to get this kind of\r\n\r\nresult if we say to the people, \"You can go or you can\r\n\r\nstay at home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one sad thing in the Singapore City Council\r\n\r\naffairs.  The  debate that is going  on  in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  whether  it is on a big  thing  or  a  small\r\n\r\nmatter, is so well-known that it may be known all over\r\n\r\nthe world by now. Regarding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe decisions made by the City Council, are they fully\r\n\r\nand popularly supported by the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These City Councillors were returned on a small\r\n\r\nmargin  of  votes polled, some as low as 15 per  cent.\r\n\r\nWhere  were those 85 per cent voters? Where was  their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvoice?  What  was their stand? Do they  approve  every\r\n\r\naction  taken  and  every issue  raised  in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, any decision or legislation passed will\r\n\r\nnot  represent the wishes of the people  as  a  whole,\r\n\r\nunless  all the eligible voters take part in it.  Then\r\n\r\nwill the democratic process be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why I support compulsory voting is\r\n\r\nthat I believe it would bring to the polls many voters\r\n\r\nwho  are in favour of a stable form of government. The\r\n\r\nright of suffrage and democracy can be preserved  only\r\n\r\nthrough the exercise of that right. Are the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore fully aware of our political aspirations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time I have been confronted by foreign\r\n\r\nvisitors  and  they seem to think that  our  political\r\n\r\nstatus is rather peculiar. They say that we are not  a\r\n\r\nColony  because we are going to have a Head  of  State\r\n\r\n(maybe we will have to address him as His Majesty  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara), and yet we  are  under  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of the Colonial Office in London. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  are neither a Colony nor an independent state. Why\r\n\r\nhas   Singapore  been  thrown  into  such  a  peculiar\r\n\r\nsituation? I wonder how many people know this exactly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time I have not only advocated a merger,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  popularly supported by our Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nTun Lim Yew Hock, or even our most respected-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member should\r\n\r\nstop at \"Chief Minister\", and not give him a name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Even if these two nationalist\r\n\r\nleaders, our Chief Minister and the Prime Minister  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya, decide on a merger, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  Whitehall  or even the White House  will  allow\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya to merge so easily. It is because\r\n\r\nSingapore has been outlined as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmost  important  strategic port by the  Western  bloc.\r\n\r\nThey  just  do  not  trust the people  of  Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore. In this respect, I would like to recall the\r\n\r\nremarks  I made in this House about two years ago.  We\r\n\r\nmust think this: without Gen. Tojo in Japan and Hitler\r\n\r\nin  Germany, I do not think we will ever have this so-called   constitutional  advancement   or   a   Rendel\r\n\r\nConstitution even. In other words, Sir, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering how Gen. Tojo has anything\r\n\r\nto do with compulsory voting in Singapore. Perhaps the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  would  like  to  relate  Gen.  Tojo   to\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, we cannot afford to have any\r\n\r\nradical change. If there is any radical change we must\r\n\r\nwait  for the whole of Asia or the whole world to have\r\n\r\na  change.  Therefore, we need a moderate  and  stable\r\n\r\nGovernment. We do not want any pink party (not red but\r\n\r\npink).  They try to mislead the masses. They  want  to\r\n\r\nhave  land  reforms;  they  want  to  \"down  with  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists!\";  and they want us to be  ruled  by  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and farmers in this country. Therefore,  Sir,\r\n\r\nit is only by compulsory voting that we can settle it.\r\n\r\nWe need a moderate and stable Government. We are going\r\n\r\nto  force  the middle-aged people and the middle-class\r\n\r\nto  exercise  their right. The right of  suffrage  and\r\n\r\ndemocracy  can be preserved only through the  exercise\r\n\r\nof  that right. It is no use of their crying, \"We want\r\n\r\nto  be  citizens of Singapore,\" and when it  comes  to\r\n\r\nvoting  they  remain  at  home.  Therefore,  the   new\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  new  voters  of  today  are  of   vital\r\n\r\nimportance  and I shall term it a potential  force  to\r\n\r\nthis country. It is only through these middle-aged and\r\n\r\nmiddle-class people that Singapore is as prosperous as\r\n\r\nit  is  today.  Yet their wishes and their  views  are\r\n\r\nnever  represented in the Legislative Assembly or  the\r\n\r\nCity Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, nobody dares to disregard or ignore the danger\r\n\r\nwhich  lies ahead of us, of the great tendency of  the\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Singapore who either suffer from political  apathy\r\n\r\nor   fall   into  the  hands  of  what  we  call   the\r\n\r\nunscrupulous politicians who lure either with power or\r\n\r\nthrough the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a newspaper cutting which shows why we need a\r\n\r\nmoderate  and stable government. Here is a picture  in\r\n\r\nthe  Straits  Times of 23rd December,  1958,  the  day\r\n\r\nafter the mayoral election result was announced.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI show the picture here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captions read: \"P.A.P. Cheers\", \"Clenched fists\",\r\n\r\n\"Victory proves people back us - Mayor,\" \"Ong re-elected\r\n\r\nMayor  for new term.\" Sir, what I would like  to  show\r\n\r\nyou  are these two pictures, one showing the newly re-elected Mayor being chaired by P.A.P. supporters  with\r\n\r\nclenched  fists, and another one showing T. T.  Rajah,\r\n\r\nwith  a clenched fist. I invite every hon. Member here\r\n\r\nto have a close look and study these pictures. Why are\r\n\r\nthese  faces  so  youthful? In some  instances,  their\r\n\r\nmouths are opened as if they were shouting during some\r\n\r\nbig  festival. Why cannot we get more varieties of age\r\n\r\ngroups?   See  this  picture - where  are  the  parents,\r\n\r\nteachers and employers? Why cannot Mayor Ong Eng  Guan\r\n\r\nbe  supported by all races, all classes  and  all  age\r\n\r\ngroups?  They  are  not  in this  group  here  in  the\r\n\r\npicture.  A moderate estimate shows that the  majority\r\n\r\nof  them  are below 25. A closer look may reveal  that\r\n\r\nthey  are even below 20. Is this country going  to  be\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by this crowd who turned up  at  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil Mayoral election? I am sure that every genuine\r\n\r\nnationalist leader here, including our People's Action\r\n\r\nParty  leader,  will not be satisfied if  their  Party\r\n\r\nwere  to  be supported by youngsters only.  They  only\r\n\r\nbelong  to a certain group-workers, students, farmers.\r\n\r\nThey are only the Chinese-speaking group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this picture, the question is posed. Where\r\n\r\nwas  the middle-aged group who was interested  in  the\r\n\r\nCity Council elections?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason why I am in favour of compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting is that I believe compulsory voting would  tend\r\n\r\nto  produce a better type of candidates for  election.\r\n\r\nIt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  only  by compulsory voting that you can  produce  a\r\n\r\nmore suitable type of candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a queer belief among our people in\r\n\r\nthese  last few years that you must vote for the Party.\r\n\r\nDo  not  care about the candidates. Even how  unpopular\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar is, never mind about him.\r\n\r\nThe  People's Action Party is the best. Do not care for\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar. He is nothing.  But  the\r\n\r\nParty is important. There is no more individuality, but\r\n\r\ncollective  regimental  organisation.  That   is   the\r\n\r\npicture we are going to see. Tom and Harry can  be  put\r\n\r\nup as candidates for the election as long as they stand\r\n\r\nfor  a particular party. They do not care what kind  of\r\n\r\npersonality or ability they have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that by compulsory voting, the middle-aged group and the middle class people, who are mature\r\n\r\nand experienced, will be able to give a better lead. If\r\n\r\nwe  can  force those people to go to the  polls,  they\r\n\r\nwill be able to influence others around them to go too.\r\n\r\nI  give a particular example. If I go to the polls,  my\r\n\r\nwife  will naturally follow me. But if I do not go,  my\r\n\r\nwife will not be bothered to go. She will say: \"Even my\r\n\r\nhusband does not care about voting, so why should I  go\r\n\r\nto  the  polls?\"  So if I am the one who  goes  to  the\r\n\r\npolls,  I can at least bring one voter more. No  matter\r\n\r\nwhether or not it is decisive, we can at least cast our\r\n\r\nvote with conscience and knowledge. We will be able  to\r\n\r\nknow how to choose the suitable candidate that is going\r\n\r\nto  represent the best interests of the people of  that\r\n\r\nparticular division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that only by compulsory voting can we\r\n\r\nencourage  persons of good character and  ability,  who\r\n\r\nare   not   interested  in  getting   any   Ministerial\r\n\r\nappointment  or  have  any axe  to  grind,  to  reflect\r\n\r\ngenuine public opinion by fearlessly speaking out their\r\n\r\nminds.  This will tend to force any political Party  to\r\n\r\npick its candidates most carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth reason why I am in favour of compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting  is  that  it  tends to  reduce  corruption  and\r\n\r\nmalpractices. I believe that compulsory voting  can  at\r\n\r\nleast   eradicate   part   of   the   corruption    and\r\n\r\nmalpractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us refer for a moment to the famous Elias\r\n\r\nCommission  Report. Although this Report  was  bitterly\r\n\r\ncriticized by the People's Action Party, it has  opened\r\n\r\nthe  eyes of the people of Singapore and made known  to\r\n\r\nthem  how  the elections are actually run, who controls\r\n\r\nthem and who influences them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to relate a personal story which I experienced\r\n\r\non  my  way home from abroad in a liner just  two  days\r\n\r\nbefore  the Kallang by-election to the City Council.  A\r\n\r\nstranger  knowing that I was from Singapore, asked  me,\r\n\r\n\"Is it true that Singapore politics are in the hands of\r\n\r\nstudents  and  gangsters and the fight in Singapore  is\r\n\r\ncaused by the students and gangsters?\" Sir, is it not a\r\n\r\nshame  for  an  elected representative of Singapore  to\r\n\r\nhear such stories? The stranger did not know who I was.\r\n\r\nHe  only  knew that I was a Singaporean. Sir, it  is  a\r\n\r\nwell-known fact that in past elections - this is actually\r\n\r\nreferred to in the Elias Commission Report - undemocratic\r\n\r\nand  unscrupulous  elements had  infiltrated  into  our\r\n\r\nranks.  What are we then going to do about  the  coming\r\n\r\nelections?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition of \"corruption\" in the public\r\n\r\nmind  is  still not very clear. The act of  giving  two\r\n\r\nbottles  of  brandy  or an ang pow of  $100  is  called\r\n\r\ncorruption.  Sir,  that, in  fact,  is  not  true.  In\r\n\r\npolitics, the definition of \"corruption' should include\r\n\r\npower corruption and moral corruption, besides material\r\n\r\ncorruption. Let our people understand clearly in  their\r\n\r\nminds  that  there are politicians without  any  morals\r\n\r\nthirsting for power. They are as equally corrupt as the\r\n\r\ngangsters in the streets. The gangsters intimidate  the\r\n\r\ninnocent  public  by  the  use  of  force.  There   are\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  and  selfish  politicians  who  influence\r\n\r\nignorant  youngsters, workers and  farmers  with  their\r\n\r\nirresponsible  promises.  Sir,  these  politicians  are\r\n\r\nequally  guilty of corruption. Sir, to those  extremist\r\n\r\npoliticians  who  know  too well  that  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nremain a Colony for some time and also that Singapore's\r\n\r\nlivelihood is dependent, not only politically but  also\r\n\r\neconomically, on Her Majesty's pleasure, I  would  like\r\n\r\nto ask the Member for Sembawang who is not here, that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould the Naval Base authorities decide to close down\r\n\r\nthe  Naval Base in Singapore, how he would be able  to\r\n\r\nlook  after  the welfare of the tens of  thousands  of\r\n\r\nworkers who are employed in the Naval Base. Sir, I  am\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Changi  and  I  know  how  much  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people of Changi is dependent on the\r\n\r\nChangi    Airport.   If   because   of   international\r\n\r\nrepercussions  or Commonwealth implications  Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot  get its freedom, how can we promise our people\r\n\r\nunrealistic,  impractical and even impossible  changes\r\n\r\nto  this  country? Sir, I pray to God  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill never have a Government with such an outlook.  If\r\n\r\nI  have  a  durian, you might say, it is shit \"because\r\n\r\nMr  Lim Cher Kheng's durian must be shit\". But if  it\r\n\r\nwas  the durian of, say, the Member for Tanjong Pagar,\r\n\r\nthen  it  would be a durian. Sir, the public may  have\r\n\r\ncome  to  believe  that  the  Preservation  of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity   Ordinance  passed  by  the   Labour   Front\r\n\r\nCoalition  Government  is undemocratic,  but  had  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  been  passed by the P.A.P.  Government,  it\r\n\r\nwould have been made to appear that it would serve  to\r\n\r\nbring  Singapore  nearer to the Federation.  Sir,  all\r\n\r\nthese irresponsible, unrealistic and selfish political\r\n\r\npromises  can  be countered only by compulsory  voting\r\n\r\nwhich  will  open  the  eyes  of  the  people  to  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of these morally corrupt politicians.  They\r\n\r\nare equally as bad as corrupt gangsters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is addressing the\r\n\r\nChair and the Chair is, I think, today being very much\r\n\r\nintimidated. I would ask the hon. Member  to  modulate\r\n\r\nhis  voice  and perhaps be a little calmer  about  the\r\n\r\nwhole matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir, I cannot\r\n\r\nhelp it because I am so sorry at the thought that  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore only understand the definition  of\r\n\r\ncorruption  as  merely  the receiving  of  bottles  of\r\n\r\nbrandy and cash. They do not know that there is such a\r\n\r\nthing as power and moral corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore strongly advocate compulsory voting\r\n\r\nbecause I believe that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough   compulsory  voting  we  can   get   rid   of\r\n\r\ncorruption, including moral and power corruption,  and\r\n\r\nmalpractices.  In  the  past, we  have  seen  how  the\r\n\r\nregimented  students of a Party were  ordered  to  get\r\n\r\nready  to  start a meeting, if Mr So and So  were  to\r\n\r\nstand up on the stage, they clapped their hands.  Only\r\n\r\na  few  persons  at first would start  clapping  their\r\n\r\nhands.  Sir, you know our masses here; if a few  start\r\n\r\nto  clap  hands,  then  immediately  everybody  starts\r\n\r\nclapping hands too. These students are regimented  and\r\n\r\nwell  trained. The students and the workers are  told,\r\n\r\n\"Our  Party is going to have a political meeting at  a\r\n\r\ncertain  place.\" A group of people will then be  given\r\n\r\nthe front seats and when the leaders have spoken there\r\n\r\nis  loud clapping. The reporters quickly send out this\r\n\r\nmessage,  \"This  Party  is very  well  supported.  The\r\n\r\nattendance is wonderful and the Party has the  genuine\r\n\r\nsupport  of the people of Singapore.\" Sir, to me  that\r\n\r\nis  also  a  kind of corruption - the kind of corruption\r\n\r\nwhich misleads our public into believing that such and\r\n\r\nsuch  a  Party  is genuinely supported and  is  beyond\r\n\r\ncorruption. This sort of a Party is corrupted and very\r\n\r\nirresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last reason why I am in favour of compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting is that it would stimulate the interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople in the elections and in political issues.  Sir,\r\n\r\nif I want my children to learn, I must compel them to\r\n\r\ngo  to  school.  They will be able to concentrate  and\r\n\r\nlearn  quickly. It is human nature that if you  compel\r\n\r\npeople  to  do anything, they will show some  concern,\r\n\r\nbut  if  you  do not compel them to do anything,  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  show  any  concern. I  will  quote  another\r\n\r\npractical example, Sir. Today, the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  a  Queen's Scholar, has to learn  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage most diligently. Sir, why does the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar have to devote so much of his  precious\r\n\r\ntime  to  study Chinese most diligently? It is because\r\n\r\nthe circumstances compel him to do so. If he wants  to\r\n\r\nbecome  a  popularly supported leader of the  Chinese-speaking  students and workers, he  must  be  able  to\r\n\r\nspeak  Mandarin, Sir. Therefore, we should induce  our\r\n\r\npeople to be more politically conscious and to be more\r\n\r\ninterested in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  affairs. We must force them to understand  the\r\n\r\nissues at stake in the next elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, those people who claim that\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting is undemocratic,  impractical  and\r\n\r\nuseless  should  bear in mind that  unless  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting is introduced, Singapore cannot be safe against\r\n\r\nthe  insidious  attempt  to  seize  power  by  morally\r\n\r\ncorrupted  extremists  thirsting  for  power  and   by\r\n\r\ngangsters. It is only by compulsory voting that we can\r\n\r\nget  rid  of  this danger. Only compulsory voting  can\r\n\r\nensure  for Singapore a government which is  popularly\r\n\r\nsupported by and is truly representative of all races\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Singapore today needs a government with\r\n\r\nsuch  popular support. We should never allow Singapore\r\n\r\nto  fall into the hands of a government which is  only\r\n\r\nsupported by a section of the people - workers, farmers\r\n\r\nor  any  racial group. We want a government which  can\r\n\r\nprovide  for  our welfare and prosperity - a  government\r\n\r\nwhich  has the confidence of the people and  which  is\r\n\r\npopularly supported by all races in all age groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.42 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nmust rise to congratulate the Member for Changi on his\r\n\r\nmost coherent and perhaps the best speech in the whole\r\n\r\nof his career in this House. Sir, I do so because I am\r\n\r\namazed  at  the  growth of his political  maturity.  I\r\n\r\nrecall  the time when he first crossed my path  during\r\n\r\nthe  first general elections. He stood at the platform\r\n\r\nof my opponent in Paya Lebar Airport and there he made\r\n\r\na speech saying, \"Mr Lim Koon Teck is the Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe  Appeals Board in the Singapore Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nand,  as  Chairman,  he  is responsible  for  all  the\r\n\r\nevictions.\"  I must say that possibly the  information\r\n\r\nwas falsely passed to him and I bear him no malice for\r\n\r\nsaying that, although at that time I had a writ  ready\r\n\r\nto unseat him from this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those were the things which we had to face when\r\n\r\nwe  fought  the  first elections  to  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  under the Rendel Constitution. I  have  been\r\n\r\nsold that political elections is a dirty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngame  and  I found, to my cost, that nothing  is  more\r\n\r\ndirty  than  that  in Singapore.  We  who  fought  the\r\n\r\nelections know how much we suffered and how many  home\r\n\r\ntruths  on corruption there are in the Elias Commission\r\n\r\nReport.  So  much so, Sir, that very many  responsible\r\n\r\npeople  refuse  to come forward as candidates  because\r\n\r\nthey are afraid to be slandered, defamed and have  all\r\n\r\nthe mud thrown at them on the election platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of compulsion in anything, particularly in\r\n\r\nusing one's sacred right to vote, must be repugnant to\r\n\r\nmost  of us, but when we consider and reflect on  what\r\n\r\nhas  happened during the past few elections  we  have\r\n\r\nhad in Singapore, I think we must strike a balance and\r\n\r\nsay  that  under  no other system than the  compulsory\r\n\r\nsystem  of voting will Singapore be able to produce  a\r\n\r\ntruly  representative government  for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We have seen on election day how troops  of\r\n\r\nboys  and young men and gangsters having all sorts  of\r\n\r\nemblems  tied around their foreheads, on their  shirts\r\n\r\nand  on their cars, rushing about from house to  house\r\n\r\ntelling lies sometimes to the extent that where  there\r\n\r\nare  old people in a house, they tell them, \"You  must\r\n\r\ncome and vote for us,\" and then, when they are in  the\r\n\r\ncar,  they are told, \"Now you must vote for a  certain\r\n\r\nParty  and  if you do not do so, we shall be  able  to\r\n\r\nfind  out  for  whom you voted, and dire  consequences\r\n\r\nwill  happen to you if you do not vote for  us.\"  Sir,\r\n\r\nall these things must be stopped. We must stop the use\r\n\r\nof  all  cars.  This costs a large sum  of  money  and\r\n\r\nentails  an  obligation to the person  who  lends  the\r\n\r\ncandidate  his  car which sometimes gets  damaged.  We\r\n\r\nmust,  in  every respect, try to make it  possible  so\r\n\r\nthat  a candidate can contest the polls without having\r\n\r\nto  contravene the law by spending more than  what  is\r\n\r\nallowed   under   the   Local   Government   Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us make it possible for the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  voting day to reflect  calmly,  without\r\n\r\nbeing  oppressed and without being dragged into  motor\r\n\r\ncars,  on  the  candidate whom he wants  and  whom  he\r\n\r\nthinks  will  serve  him best.

They\r\n\r\nwere  either not found at their addresses or they  were\r\n\r\nfound  at  the  wrong addresses. So it  would  be  more\r\n\r\ncorrect  to  say that the number of voters was  60  per\r\n\r\ncent of those registered. In my Ward, 70 to 75 per cent\r\n\r\nof the total number of voters went to the polls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quoting figures of the elections in England:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Macmillan - out of 47,000 voters for the\r\n\r\nconstituency, 40,000 voted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Gaitskell - out of 57,000 voters, 38,000 voted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Attlee - out of 42,000 voters 34,000 voted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Lennox-Boyd - out of 49,000 voters, 33,000\r\n\r\nvoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rt. Hon. Lyttleton - out of 50,000 voters, 40,000 voted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Winston Churchill - out of 72,000 voters, 62,000\r\n\r\nvoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>When  I  quote  \"Sir Winston Churchill - out  of  72,000\r\n\r\nvoters,  62,000  voted\", it does not mean  that  62,000\r\n\r\npeople  voted for Sir Winston Churchill. It means  that\r\n\r\n62,000  people of the whole constituency went to  vote.\r\n\r\nSo  this  works out to about 60 to 70 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal number of voters who went to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all admit that the election registers of\r\n\r\nSingapore are absolutely inaccurate. You could  put  it\r\n\r\nat  literally  60 per cent of the voters,  if  you  are\r\n\r\nlucky  to get them. Of this 60 per cent of the  voters,\r\n\r\n70  to 75 per cent went to vote. So I do not understand\r\n\r\nhow  it can be said, \"Ah, the people are not coming  to\r\n\r\nvote.  Therefore, we must have an Ordinance  to  compel\r\n\r\nthe people to come and vote.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in England, as I said, the election machinery\r\n\r\nhas  been  in  motion for the last 130  years,  but  in\r\n\r\nSingapore the elections started only from 1948. How can\r\n\r\nit  be said, \"The people of Singapore are just going to\r\n\r\nbe  indifferent. They are not enlightened. They are not\r\n\r\nintelligent enough to take part in the elections.\"?  So\r\n\r\nwhen you take 60 per cent of those registered as voters\r\n\r\nto  be the accurate figure due to the fact that 40  per\r\n\r\ncent of those registered as voters are untraceable, the\r\n\r\nresponse  of  the  voters  in  Singapore  is  excellent\r\n\r\ncomparing  our election results with those  of  England\r\n\r\nwhere elections have been going on without a break  for\r\n\r\nthe last 130 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has brought up this Bill with\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of getting indifferent and  unenlightened\r\n\r\npeople  to come to vote. My point is that there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed for us to compel such people to come and vote.  If\r\n\r\nyou  say  that there are quite a number of  indifferent\r\n\r\nvoters  in  Singapore, there are also people  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  who are equally indifferent and who  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  vote  and if you are going  to  compel  these\r\n\r\npeople to vote, there must be something wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I oppose the particular clause which compels the\r\n\r\npeople to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock(Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In reply, Sir.

While\r\n\r\nwe were in this House last Thursday, Sir, I received  a\r\n\r\ntelephone call\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Chairman  of  the  Constitution  Exposition\r\n\r\nCommittee  informing me that the Committee  felt  that\r\n\r\nthey  did  not  consider  it  advisable  to  open  the\r\n\r\nExposition on the 21st of this month as fixed, because\r\n\r\nthe  ground was not firm, and because of the incessant\r\n\r\nrain,  the  ground was so muddy that  it  would  cause\r\n\r\ngreat  inconvenience to the public and that  it  would\r\n\r\ndeter the public from visiting the Exposition. Would I\r\n\r\nbe  good enough to agree to a postponement? When  that\r\n\r\nquestion was posed to me, Sir, in all humility I  must\r\n\r\nsay that, with my experience in the political field, I\r\n\r\nknew that this postponement would be caught hold of by\r\n\r\nthe   People's  Action  Party  to  turn  it  to  their\r\n\r\npolitical  advantage. I thought to myself  whether  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  better for me to tell them, \"Go ahead  with\r\n\r\nthe  opening. I do not care about the comforts of  the\r\n\r\npublic!\"  and  thereby save the  Government  from  any\r\n\r\nodious remarks from the members of the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty.  But,  Sir, having been in the service  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, having loved them, as  I  still\r\n\r\nlove  them  and think of their welfare more  than  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  my Party and myself and my Government,  I\r\n\r\nfelt  that it was right and proper that if the grounds\r\n\r\nwere  not  ready for them to attend the exhibition,  I\r\n\r\nhad  no  objection.  Therefore,  the  opening  of  the\r\n\r\nExposition was postponed and, as expected  by  me,  it\r\n\r\nwas  twisted  and  twisted in  such  a  way  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   pavilions  were  not  ready,   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  machinery  is  not  good,  that  only  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  which  is now running the City  Council,  can\r\n\r\ndeliver  the goods in time, can do what they say  they\r\n\r\nwould do at a certain date.

We know that in political life, one must\r\n\r\nbe  quite prepared to accept political trickery!  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanjong Pagar then says:  it  is  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  our  defeat in the City Council  elections\r\n\r\nthat  we  delayed the District Council elections.  The\r\n\r\nhon. Member will remember that it was he who tabled  a\r\n\r\nmotion  for the appointment of a Commission, resulting\r\n\r\nin  the appointment of the Elias Commission. That  was\r\n\r\nin   July  1957.  The  Commission  was  appointed   in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1957,  I  remember,  and  the  Report   was\r\n\r\nsubmitted and tabled in this House in April 1958.  The\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of that Report received  commendation\r\n\r\neven  from the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, although\r\n\r\nI  can  still remember he did try to move a motion  to\r\n\r\ncensure  certain parts of the Report,  and  he  failed\r\n\r\nmiserably. It was because the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nElias  Commission were felt stupid that, in  the  best\r\n\r\ninterests  of clean elections, amendments  had  to  be\r\n\r\nmade to incorporate those recommendations, so that all\r\n\r\nfuture elections can have a chance of being clean.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  Sir, there was the All-Party Constitution\r\n\r\ndelegation  to London; again to finalise the  drafting\r\n\r\nof  the  Orders  in Council. So it  was  felt  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, even with the knowledge of the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar, that the quickest way to set about\r\n\r\nimplementing these recommendations was to introduce an\r\n\r\namending   Bill  to  the  Local  Government  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  so  that  whatever  is  decided  by   this\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly could be incorporated  into  the\r\n\r\namending  Bill  to  amend  the  Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  Elections Ordinance. The amending  Bill  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  for  First Reading a  few  days  ago,  and\r\n\r\nwhatever is decided on this Bill decides the  fate  of\r\n\r\nthat  amending Bill. The amending Bill was  introduced\r\n\r\nin  July last year. After its Second Reading, a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  was appointed. All Parties were represented\r\n\r\nin Select Committee. Deliberations had been protracted\r\n\r\nbecause  there had to be discussions on various  lines\r\n\r\nof   approach   and  the  feasibility  of  introducing\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting. The Report of the Select  Committee\r\n\r\nwas presented to this Assembly on 29th November, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to the accusation that it is the\r\n\r\nGovernment who seeks to introduce compulsory voting in\r\n\r\norder  to  try  their luck at getting  back  into  the\r\n\r\nGovernment again. I would like hon. Members to refresh\r\n\r\ntheir minds that when the amending Bill was introduced\r\n\r\nin  July  1958,  there  was no  clause  on  compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting. There was none. It was not in the Bill because\r\n\r\nI felt, as I said yesterday, that as compulsory voting\r\n\r\na matter of great importance to all political Parties,\r\n\r\nit  should  be discussed in Select Committee,  and  if\r\n\r\naccepted, it could be introduced into the Bill.  Where\r\n\r\nthen   is   the   accusation   that   the   Government\r\n\r\ndeliberately introduced compulsory voting in order  to\r\n\r\nstage  a  comeback? Sir, I myself did not  think  that\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting would help the Government because of\r\n\r\nthe experience I have gained over the past years - this\r\n\r\nmove, as in every other move of the Government, can be\r\n\r\ntwisted about in such a way as to cause the voters  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  simply  to  cast  their  vote  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment out of spite! It could happen that way.  In\r\n\r\nfact, it is a great danger to the Government to accept\r\n\r\ncompulsory  voting.  It  is  not  something  that   we\r\n\r\nintroduce  in order to put us in. I am sure  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar and his Party, while  having\r\n\r\ndreams  of  becoming the next Government of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  while most of their leaders have gone  out  on  a\r\n\r\nwitch-hunt, are already saying what they will  do  and\r\n\r\nwhat they will not do to those that are with them  and\r\n\r\nto  those that are not with them. I have felt that the\r\n\r\nburden  of  Government is indeed a heavy one.  It  has\r\n\r\nweighed heavily upon me, but I am not doing all I  can\r\n\r\nthrough  the machinery of the Government  in  any  way\r\n\r\nwhatsoever to say that I am staging a comeback through\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting, and to tell the people, \"Unless you\r\n\r\nvote for us, watch out!\" We do not do that, Sir,It is\r\n\r\nup  to the people of Singapore. The fate of Singapore\r\n\r\nis  in their hands. If they want us to serve, we  will\r\n\r\ngladly serve. If they do not want us to serve, we will\r\n\r\ntake  it.  But we do not go out of our way to  try  to\r\n\r\ncorrupt  the minds of the public by matters  that  are\r\n\r\nmost irresponsible, by actions that are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot right. If we do get into the Government, we get  in\r\n\r\nto  serve  the  people of Singapore. But  I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthrough  the  activities, the actions,  the  words  and\r\n\r\ndeeds  of a different political Party which is  seeking\r\n\r\npower  today - they are seeking it because they  want  to\r\n\r\nsay,  \"We,  the P.A.P., are the Party.

In  this way, they say that  because  this\r\n\r\namendment cannot be implemented during the lifetime  of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly, therefore, it is just-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> A waste of time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - a waste of time. Whereas the\r\n\r\nhon.

I am sure the hon.

I\r\n\r\nsaid  in  my opening speech that the Hon.

The main\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobjections were jointly from the Chambers of Commerce,\r\n\r\nand  the  grounds  for  the main  opposition  were  as\r\n\r\nfollows.  First,  they objected to  the  licensing  of\r\n\r\nmanufacture   of  almost  every  type,  because   they\r\n\r\nconsidered  that that was too rigorous  a  requirement\r\n\r\nand  created  a  state of uncertainty. Secondly,  they\r\n\r\nconsidered  that the 15-year life of the  licence  was\r\n\r\ntoo  short  and that there was no certainty  that  the\r\n\r\nlicences  would be renewed by a different  government.\r\n\r\nThey  also  considered that the power  vested  in  the\r\n\r\nMinister  was  too excessive, and that there  were  no\r\n\r\nchecks  on  the Minister in the form of any  machinery\r\n\r\nfor  appeals.  They  considered  that  there  was   no\r\n\r\nsafeguard for those who were in the course of  setting\r\n\r\nup  industrial projects. And finally some of them were\r\n\r\nopposed  to  the  granting of monopolies  to  any  one\r\n\r\nmanufacturer.  These points, Sir, were  considered  by\r\n\r\nthe Government, and amendments were moved by me in the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  to  remedy these  main  grounds  of\r\n\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended Bill, Sir, meets this opposition by the\r\n\r\nfollowing  methods: licensing has been  abolished  and\r\n\r\nregistration has been substituted. The 15-year  period\r\n\r\nhas  now been removed so that registration is  for  an\r\n\r\nindefinite  period. Manufacture of every type  is  now\r\n\r\nnot  required  to  be  registered;  instead  only  the\r\n\r\nmanufacture of those items specified in the  Schedules\r\n\r\nis  required  to be registered. A Registrar  has  been\r\n\r\nprovided  for  to administer the requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and  an  appeal to the Minister  over  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar   has  been  provided  for.  Additions   and\r\n\r\nvariations  to  the Schedules are to be  made  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  but an appeal to the Assembly  is  provided\r\n\r\nfor  in  the form of a provision whereby the  Assembly\r\n\r\ncan,  by  a  motion,  overrule the Minister.  Projects\r\n\r\nalready set up and are manufacturing cannot be refused\r\n\r\nregistration. Projects in the course of being  set  up\r\n\r\nare  safeguarded by a provision that registration  for\r\n\r\nsuch  projects cannot be refused except for  those  in\r\n\r\nthe Second Schedule. The granting of monopolies by the\r\n\r\nRegistrar will still be possible, but will now have to\r\n\r\nbe gazetted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that  the public are informed and they could  make\r\n\r\nrepresentations  to the Minister, and  therefore  this\r\n\r\ngranting  of  monopolies is subject to appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the salient features of the amended Bill as\r\n\r\nit  has  emerged  from the Select  Committee.

The Minister for Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry  now holds the record of having introduced  a\r\n\r\nBill  which  underwent the most drastic transformation\r\n\r\nof  any  Bill in Select Committee. You will  remember,\r\n\r\nSir,  when he moved the Second Reading of this  Bill,\r\n\r\nbefore  it was committed to Select Committee, that  he\r\n\r\nconsidered  any  move  to  send  the  Bill  to  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee as an attempt to block and stymie him. Sir,\r\n\r\nhe  might  well  be right in guessing the  motives  of\r\n\r\nthose   who  wanted  to  send  this  Bill  to   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  but certainly by the amendments  which  he\r\n\r\nhas  accepted  and introduced into this Bill,  he  has\r\n\r\nconfessed that, in fact, his first thoughts  were  not\r\n\r\nhis best thoughts. He prided himself for having made a\r\n\r\nspeech on one occasion when he uttered famous words to\r\n\r\na  famous  gathering which included the  Secretary  of\r\n\r\nState  for the United States of America without  first\r\n\r\nhaving  committed it to paper. He regaled us with  the\r\n\r\nprivilege of hearing it after it had been committed to\r\n\r\npaper. Sir, the experience which he has undergone as a\r\n\r\nresult  of this Bill should be a constant reminder  to\r\n\r\nhim  that  bright ideas should first be put on  paper.\r\n\r\nThey  should  be  carefully  considered  not  only  by\r\n\r\nhimself\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  by  all  his experts, and should receive  further\r\n\r\nconsideration   after  everybody   has   given   their\r\n\r\ncontributions as to what was right and  wrong  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.   He   would   then  have  saved   himself   the\r\n\r\nembarrassment of having been the Minister who put in a\r\n\r\nBill  which received the most number of amendments  in\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, as it is now passed, still enables him to\r\n\r\npursue his pet topic, because I notice that cigarettes\r\n\r\nand matches are put in a special Second Schedule. I do\r\n\r\nnot  want, Sir, to join in this speculation as to  the\r\n\r\nprofits  which  can be milched out  of  the  cigarette\r\n\r\nindustry,  but  I  can assure the  Minister  of  this:\r\n\r\nnobody  is  going  to  make any  commitment  involving\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars on the basis of a Government whose\r\n\r\nterm  of  office  will last for approximately  another\r\n\r\neight weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.36 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy that\r\n\r\nI  am an Independent Member, and I am not seeking  any\r\n\r\npolitical  capital in the coming elections this  year.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  have no axe to grind and  do  not  care\r\n\r\nwhether this Bill is passed too early or too late, and\r\n\r\nwhether it is practicable or impracticable. Of course,\r\n\r\none  point we are in common agreement with is that  we\r\n\r\nhave to remind the Minister to explain to us how he is\r\n\r\ngoing to make this Bill work, as the statement he  has\r\n\r\njust made fails again to mention the importance of Pan\r\n\r\nMalayan  economic  development. He  has  not  told  us\r\n\r\nwhether  he has any confidence that the implementation\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  can  cope with the further  industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment in the Federation or not, and whether this\r\n\r\nBill  will  not  mislead the Federation industry  into\r\n\r\nbelieving that we are going to challenge the  industry\r\n\r\nwhich is opening up in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to touch on a point which I suggested in\r\n\r\nthe  last  Budget  debate, and that is,  we  must  get\r\n\r\ntogether -  Singapore and the Federation - and  sit  down\r\n\r\nand  try to outline a plan as to what type of industry\r\n\r\nwe are opening up and what type of goods we are going\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  manufacture,  both  in  Singapore  and  Malaya.  The\r\n\r\ninterests  of both territories are inter-related  and  a\r\n\r\nloss  suffered in Singapore will also mean an equal loss\r\n\r\nto   the   Federation.  For  example,  if  our  Minister\r\n\r\nadvocates  the  manufacture of cigarettes in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand,  at the same time, Malaya also decide to open up  a\r\n\r\ntobacco  factory,  then we would have,  in  a  territory\r\n\r\nwhich  is  so  small - Singapore  and  Malaya - two  tobacco\r\n\r\nfactories,  subsidized and supported by the  Government.\r\n\r\nTo  me  this  seems  a waste of our  resources  and  our\r\n\r\nstrength.  If  we  can manufacture  cigarettes  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation can manufacture matches, then we can  achieve\r\n\r\nwonderful  results.  Sir, this is  the  principal  point\r\n\r\nwhich  I wish the Minister to clarify more fully to  the\r\n\r\nHouse. Any legislation which he introduces in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the encouragement of industrial expansion must  be\r\n\r\non  a Pan Malayan basis, because the interests of Malaya\r\n\r\nand   Singapore  must  always  be  taken  as  a   whole,\r\n\r\nespecially in view of our common economic interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, this Bill deserves our\r\n\r\ncongratulations because it is a good Bill.  The  timing,\r\n\r\nhowever,  I regret, is rather late. But we do hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Commerce and Industry will be returned\r\n\r\nto  office  in the next Government, so that he  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  see  the implementation of this  Bill  carried\r\n\r\nthrough smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will definitely encourage local\r\n\r\nindustry.  It will definitely give an assurance  to  the\r\n\r\nlocal  industry that they will have a certain  security,\r\n\r\nand  they  will feel confident that the money they  have\r\n\r\ninvested here is going to be repaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that we have many business houses\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not keen to open up factories here.  Through\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  we are going to force, indirectly,  foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies to set up factories here. Otherwise, if we  go\r\n\r\nalong,  the  business  houses, especially  the  European\r\n\r\nbusiness houses, thinking that we must maintain our free\r\n\r\nport   status,   just   could  not   care   less   about\r\n\r\nmanufacturing our own goods here. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  quote  an example. I strongly oppose the  monopoly\r\n\r\nwhich  the Shipping Conference has in Singapore. If  you\r\n\r\nwant to export copra to Europe, the freight is lower and\r\n\r\nthe  space  can always be reserved. But if you  want  to\r\n\r\nexport coconut oil, the freight is much higher, and from\r\n\r\ntime  to time they will say that there is no more  space\r\n\r\navailable for the export of coconut oil. That shows that\r\n\r\nthe  European  business houses have a control  over  our\r\n\r\nlocal trade. Through this Bill we are going to force the\r\n\r\nEuropean  business houses to open up  factories  and  to\r\n\r\nmanufacture goods which they are used to handling here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is this. I am sure this Bill will serve\r\n\r\na  good  purpose in that it can regulate our  trade  and\r\n\r\ninvestment. To me, industry and trade are twins. As  you\r\n\r\nknow,  Sir,  all the big ports in the world today,  like\r\n\r\nLondon,  New York and Tokyo (the three biggest ports  in\r\n\r\nthe  world  today) are also known as the big  industrial\r\n\r\ncentres  of  their  country,  especially  New  York  and\r\n\r\nTokyo-although  we can consider Osaka as  an  industrial\r\n\r\ncentre too. But you cannot deny that Tokyo and New  York\r\n\r\nproduce  many manufactured goods in order that they  can\r\n\r\nexport  their  manufactured  products.  Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nentrepot position of Singapore will never be jeopardized\r\n\r\nby the boosting of industry here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heartily support this Bill. Before I sit down, I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the Minister can clarify an article which\r\n\r\nappeared  in  this morning's paper about  Mr  Hosgood's\r\n\r\ncriticism of the Minister's plan to open up factories to\r\n\r\nmanufacture cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jumabhoy, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M.

There is no embarrassment to\r\n\r\nmyself. I am not embarrassed in the least. Why should I\r\n\r\nbe embarrassed, Sir, when I have moved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese amendments myself? He says that this will create a\r\n\r\nrecord  for  a Bill that has undergone the most  drastic\r\n\r\ntransformation. No thanks to the hon. Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar. Out of nine meetings of the Select Committee,  he\r\n\r\nattended  only one meeting. The transformation that  the\r\n\r\nBill has undergone is entirely voluntary on my part.  It\r\n\r\nstill  fits  in  with the policy that I  laid  down  and\r\n\r\nannounced in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will see that the power of the Minister\r\n\r\nto  add or vary to the First Schedule remains intact. It\r\n\r\nis   immaterial  whether  the  Bill  should  be  as   it\r\n\r\noriginally was which said that everyone has got to apply\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister before he starts a factory; or whether\r\n\r\nthe Bill is in this form, so that the Minister can still\r\n\r\nmake  anyone,  whom  he  feels he  wants  to  get  under\r\n\r\ncontrol,  apply  to  him by putting  that  item  on  the\r\n\r\nSchedule. The point is that the power of the Minister is\r\n\r\nstill there, as far as the First Schedule is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always said that so long as I am allowed to\r\n\r\ncarry   out  the  policies  that  the  Government   have\r\n\r\nformulated,  if  more safeguards can  be  put  into  the\r\n\r\nlegislation, I am not going to stand in the way. It is a\r\n\r\nperfectly  democratic procedure, if you do it in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  or  even outside the Committee when  you  get\r\n\r\nreasonable objections. It is perfectly democratic to try\r\n\r\nand meet those objections by changing the wording in the\r\n\r\nlaw  so  long as the basic requirement of the government\r\n\r\nbeing able to carry out its policy remains intact. I can\r\n\r\nwell  understand, Sir, that such a procedure  would  not\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  who  is  well\r\n\r\nversed  in a dictatorial form of administration,  as  is\r\n\r\nnow  going on in the City Council. Therefore, if he puts\r\n\r\nup  legislation, one may well expect he will not  change\r\n\r\nit,  even  though it could very well be changed  without\r\n\r\naffecting the powers that the legislation should have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi has asked me to clarify the\r\n\r\nreply which one big cigarette organisation has given to\r\n\r\nmy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclarification in the Assembly on the profit factor.\r\n\r\nI do not know, Sir, what he wants me to clarify, but -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He wants to know whether an\r\n\r\ninvestment of $500 will bring in a profit of $500!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I can say that this reply in\r\n\r\nno way says that I am wrong in my calculation of the\r\n\r\nprofit factor. The only place where it says that I am\r\n\r\nwrong is about the cheaper brands. Sir, I have taken\r\n\r\nthat into calculation and when I said in this House last\r\n\r\nweek that I had estimated the profit factor would be\r\n\r\nabout 60 per cent based on the sale of two million\r\n\r\ncigarettes, I was, in fact, only estimating the profit\r\n\r\non the medium type of cigarettes and not on the lower\r\n\r\ntype. Singapore smokes 6 million cigarettes a day, out\r\n\r\nof which 5 million are imported. I was estimating my\r\n\r\nprofit of 60 per cent only on the sale of 2 million, not\r\n\r\non the sale of 6 million cigarettes. Sir, I have\r\n\r\ntherefore taken this factor into consideration when I\r\n\r\nsaid I estimate the profit factor would be 60 per cent\r\n\r\nof the capital. [Laughter.] It is no use, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar laughing it off, because these\r\n\r\nare hard facts. These are calculated figures which the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar may try to belittle, but he\r\n\r\ncannot get over them. I only wish the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore know of these facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, Sir, Mr Hosgood said the Minister spoke\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  150 million cigarettes monthly,  but  the\r\n\r\nprofit  depended upon whether every smoker would  accept\r\n\r\nthe  new  brand and that no cigarettes would be smuggled\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore. Sir, I said 150 million cigarettes  was\r\n\r\nthe number imported, but my profit factor was calculated\r\n\r\nonly on 60 million cigarettes a month-two million a day.\r\n\r\nHowever,  on  the  question whether  every  smoker  will\r\n\r\naccept  the  new brand, I also indicated in  this  House\r\n\r\nthat  probably  there would be no  reason  to  have  new\r\n\r\nbrands  because  we  are negotiating with  the  existing\r\n\r\ntrade to try and bring a big firm into partnership on  a\r\n\r\n49  :  51 per cent basis, Singapore holding the  51  per\r\n\r\ncent. If so, then most of the popular brands could be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanufactured here. Therefore, there is no question of\r\n\r\nnew brands being rammed down the throats of the people.\r\n\r\nBut if we come to the stage where, because nobody will\r\n\r\nmake any commitments before the election results are\r\n\r\nknown - the Member for Tanjong Pagar is sure about this,\r\n\r\nand I do not know why he is so sure, but it is possible\r\n\r\nthat he may have got into contact with them and offered\r\n\r\nthem \"instead of Jumabhoy 49 per cent, the P.A.P. will\r\n\r\ngive you 51 per cent - and complete control, if possible.\"\r\n\r\n(that is why he is so sure he can stymie the progress of these negotiations) - if it comes to that, and if we are\r\n\r\nforced to have a factory entirely capitalised by\r\n\r\nSingapore capital, then the factory will have to make\r\n\r\nnew brands. I can assure this House, Sir, that even if\r\n\r\nit comes to that, we can manufacture cigarettes as good\r\n\r\nas the imported ones. There is no question that we\r\n\r\ncannot. Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, practically\r\n\r\nall Asian countries are manufacturing\r\n\r\ncigarettes - cigarettes that are considered as good as\r\n\r\nimported cigarettes. Japan and Vietnam also manufacture\r\n\r\ncigarettes as good as the imported ones. The only thing\r\n\r\nis that foreign interests will make a lot of propaganda\r\n\r\nand probably they will be assisted in this by the ex-extreme Left - at present the extreme Right - the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar in order to stymie the efforts of this\r\n\r\nGovernment to benefit the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is curious, Sir, how out of the ashes of the\r\n\r\npassionate  fires of class hatred aroused  in  1955  and\r\n\r\n1956 by members of the People's Action Party, there  now\r\n\r\narises an extreme Right-wing personality-the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar, who  would go to outside  interest  and\r\n\r\nundercut what is beneficial to Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I have never drafted any legislation with  a\r\n\r\nview   to  making  political  propaganda  at  all.
