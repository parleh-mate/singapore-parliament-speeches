Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the three\r\n\r\nvessels  referred to by the hon.  Member  are  SMF\r\n\r\n496, SMF 538 and SMF 500. Of them, the last - that\r\n\r\nis,  SMF  500  - was detained once before  by  the\r\n\r\nIndian authorities at Port Blair in February  1965\r\n\r\nand both the crew and the vessel were subsequently\r\n\r\nreleased  in April 1965. Almost in all cases,  the\r\n\r\nfishermen concerned had complained of bad  weather\r\n\r\nand  engine  trouble  for  the  difficulties.  The\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister had discussions with the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department to find out the facts of the\r\n\r\ncase. We had discussions also with the Indian High\r\n\r\nCommission  here on the same subject. I  will  now\r\n\r\nmention  briefly the case of each of  these  three\r\n\r\nfishing boats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMF 538 was apprehended by the Indian naval\r\n\r\nauthorities  for intrusion into their  territorial\r\n\r\nwaters  off the Nicobar Islands. We were  informed\r\n\r\nof  this  by  the Indian High Commission  on  15th\r\n\r\nJune, 1966. On 27th July, 1966, a request was made\r\n\r\nto  the Indian High Commission to obtain the early\r\n\r\nrelease  of  the  vessel  and  her  crew.  On  8th\r\n\r\nOctober, 1966, this Ministry was informed  by  the\r\n\r\nIndian  High Commission that the crew of SMF  538,\r\n\r\nwho had since been sentenced to two months'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nimprisonment, would be released on 30th October,  1966,\r\n\r\nbut   the   vessel  was  confiscated  by   the   Indian\r\n\r\nauthorities. This is in accordance with the Andaman and\r\n\r\nNicobar Islands Fisheries Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 16th September, 1966, a letter was received from\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Marine Product Workers' Union  that  two\r\n\r\nmore Singapore fishing boats, SMF 496 and SMF 500, with\r\n\r\na  total crew of 16 persons, had been detained  by  the\r\n\r\nIndian   authorities  at  Andaman  Islands.   On   18th\r\n\r\nNovember,  1966, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs  made\r\n\r\nrepresentations   to   the   Indian   High   Commission\r\n\r\nrequesting the High Commission to use its good  offices\r\n\r\nto  obtain the early release of the crew and the boats.\r\n\r\nA reply is awaited from the Indian authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>AMENDMENT TO LABOUR ORDINANCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour   if  he  will  consider  introducing   amending\r\n\r\nlegislation  to bring within the ambit  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance workers who are at present excluded from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Unless there are  very  strong  and\r\n\r\ncompelling reasons for the proposal made by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Bras  Basah, the Government does  not  propose  to\r\n\r\nraise the age restriction to under 21 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nis  a provision in the Labour Ordinance which prohibits\r\n\r\nfemale  factory workers from working after  10  p.m.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  the Acting Minister  for  Labour  will\r\n\r\nconsider applying the same provision to bar waitresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present prohibition\r\n\r\nof  employment of waitresses under 17 years of  age  is\r\n\r\ncontained  in the Liquors Licensing Regulations,  1962,\r\n\r\nwhich were made under the Customs Ordinance, 1960. Rule\r\n\r\n43 (1) of the Liquors Licensing Regulations reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No licensee shall employ or permit to be employed in\r\n\r\nhis licensed premises any waitress -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) who has not reached the age of 17 years, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) who he knows or has reason to believe is a\r\n\r\nprostitute or of bad character.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  relevant  regulations dealing with  bars  make  no\r\n\r\nrestriction  as  to the time within  which  such  girls\r\n\r\nshould work.

Very few farms,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  occupy more than five acres of land.  Modern\r\n\r\nscientific methods of farming by way of the proper  use\r\n\r\nof  fertilizers,  the selection of good  strains,  crop\r\n\r\nrotation  and  pest control are the most  sensible  and\r\n\r\neconomically  feasible  in the  context  of  our  local\r\n\r\nfarming  conditions.

However, to reduce the rate of accidents at\r\n\r\nthis  spot,  steps are being taken to  impose  a  speed\r\n\r\nlimit  of  20 miles per hour and it is felt  that  this\r\n\r\nmeasure, together with the existing double white  line,\r\n\r\nshould produce the desired effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ZEBRA CROSSINGS AT ANSON AND TANJONG PAGAR ROADS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

However,  there\r\n\r\nare  sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic to  allow\r\n\r\npedestrians to cross the road safely, provided care and\r\n\r\ncaution is taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation by the Traffic Police has disclosed that\r\n\r\nthe  number of pedestrians crossing Anson Road in front\r\n\r\nof  Gan Eng Seng School is negligible. The majority  of\r\n\r\npersons  crossing Anson Road in front of Gan  Eng  Seng\r\n\r\nSchool  are  the  students  of  this  school.  A  zebra\r\n\r\ncrossing  is  not  recommended at this  place.  If  the\r\n\r\nintention of requesting the zebra crossing is  for  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  then  a  school crossing patrolman  is  more\r\n\r\njustified  than a zebra crossing. Observation  will  be\r\n\r\nkept at this place when the school re-opens in January,\r\n\r\nand if it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfound necessary to have a school crossing patrolman at\r\n\r\nthis place, recommendations will a be submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the second part of the question. Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  Road is 41 feet wide and there are several  side\r\n\r\nroads.  This  road  caters  for  two-way  traffic,  and\r\n\r\nparking  is  permitted on both sides of  the  road.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  hawkers have pitched their  stalls  on  both\r\n\r\nsides  of  Tanjong  Pagar Road from Wallich  Street  to\r\n\r\nGopeng Street. This leaves only sufficient room for one-lane traffic in either direction. Vehicles will have to\r\n\r\ncrawl  along this portion of Tanjong Pagar Road.  There\r\n\r\nare  sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic to  allow\r\n\r\npedestrians  to  cross safely. There is  no  particular\r\n\r\nspot   along   Tanjong  Pagar  Road  where  pedestrians\r\n\r\nconcentrate to cross the road. Therefore,  if  a  zebra\r\n\r\ncrossing is provided along Tanjong Pagar Road, it  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  of  much practical use, since the  pedestrians\r\n\r\nwill  not take the trouble to walk all the way  to  the\r\n\r\ncrossing to cross the road, as they can cross  the  the\r\n\r\nroad  safely from wherever they approach Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nRoad.  In  view  of  this,  a  zebra  crossing  is  not\r\n\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RESIDENTS AT MACPHERSON ESTATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Payments of consolidated bills at Area Office)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

When we were a part  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, we paid 40 per cent of our national income to\r\n\r\nthe  then  Malaysian Central Government. Sir,  until  I\r\n\r\nreceived   the   Third   Supplementary   Estimates   of\r\n\r\nExpenditure for 1966, as contained in Paper Cmd. 28  of\r\n\r\n1966,  I  was under the impression that the  ex-Federal\r\n\r\ndepartments were well maintained by the then  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment.  They  had been paid 40  per  cent  of  our\r\n\r\nnational income for the purposes of maintaining all the\r\n\r\ndepartments under their care.

During\r\n\r\nthe  Lim  Yew Hock regime, it was used as the residence\r\n\r\nof  a certain Minister or Ministers. But at the present\r\n\r\nmoment, in the context of independent Singapore, it  is\r\n\r\na place of significance. It is symbolic of our Republic\r\n\r\nand  is a very important place. Its status is such that\r\n\r\nit  is used to welcome our national guests. It is  also\r\n\r\nused  as a place for the representatives of the  people\r\n\r\nto  congregate on ceremonial occasions. Therefore,  its\r\n\r\nstatus is quite different from what it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  in  the past. From the building in the istana,  we\r\n\r\ncan  see  that  it could be used in the  past  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  I have mentioned. But it is not suitable  for\r\n\r\npresent-day  purposes, because it smells  too  much  of\r\n\r\naristocracy. It was designed for the use  of  very  few\r\n\r\npeople only. But now it is used to welcome our national\r\n\r\nguests  and  as a meeting place for the representatives\r\n\r\nof  the people on festive or ceremonial occasions.  The\r\n\r\ncapacity of the hall is very small. Only a small number\r\n\r\nof  persons  may  be  housed  therein.  Because  of  my\r\n\r\npersonal  experience  after  having  attended   several\r\n\r\nfunctions  there, I have the feeling that whenever  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wishes to welcome representatives  from  the\r\n\r\npeople,  such functions are always held in the  grounds\r\n\r\nof  the  Istana, and on rainy days or very windy  days,\r\n\r\nthe people have to take shelter running with chairs and\r\n\r\ncups  and  saucers into the building  itself.  If  this\r\n\r\nsight is to be presented to our foreign guests, it will\r\n\r\nbe  a  very  disappointing one indeed.  This  may  give\r\n\r\npeople  the  impression that we are  so  poor  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot  even  afford  a  proper  place  to  hold   such\r\n\r\nfunctions. From this supplementary estimate, I can  see\r\n\r\nthat  since  we have spent so much money on decorations\r\n\r\nand  repairs,  why  not we spend  some  more  money  in\r\n\r\naltering  the Istana itself, to enlarge it so  that  it\r\n\r\ncan  hold bigger functions and make it more appropriate\r\n\r\nfor  our purposes, instead of letting it be used  by  a\r\n\r\nfew  people only, the aristocracy? This is my  view  on\r\n\r\nthis  item and I hope that the Minister concerned  will\r\n\r\ngive me a satisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I came here today\r\n\r\nprepared  to argue that the sum of $182,000,  which  we\r\n\r\nspent  on repairs and extensions to the Istana  and  on\r\n\r\nthe  renovation of the old Attorney-General's bungalow,\r\n\r\nwas well spent. I thought that the Member for Delta was\r\n\r\ncriticising  the spending of such money.  But  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  all  that she has said and, if we can spend  more\r\n\r\nmoney  on the Istana, I will be the first to spend  it.\r\n\r\nIt  is true that if there is rain on certain days  when\r\n\r\nwe  have  functions in the grounds, then it  is  rather\r\n\r\ncongested in the small hall.

My personal opinion is that the amendments\r\n\r\nare  not  only necessary but that there should be  more\r\n\r\namendments  to the original Ordinance to make  it  more\r\n\r\nwater-tight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Nanyang University has been bedevilled\r\n\r\nby  various  problems  and difficulties,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nengagement of the Chancellor. The problem started  from\r\n\r\nthe   time  when  a  foreigner  was  recruited  to   be\r\n\r\nChancellor  of the University. Up to now, the  post  of\r\n\r\nChancellor  is  still  vacant.  The  new  Ordinance  on\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  has not been  formulated  and  the\r\n\r\nUniversity is still within the purview of the  original\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The post of Vice-Chancellor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas   not  provided  for  in  the  original  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the present amendment Bill is necessary  to\r\n\r\nput right the position. One odd thing is that today  we\r\n\r\nforget about the Chancellor whereas we provide for  the\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor.  In the past, people  knew  about  the\r\n\r\nChancellor but forgot about the Vice-Chancellor. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible to go without a Chancellor,  but  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance there is no provision for a Chancellor. Since\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  such  provision in the  Ordinance,  then\r\n\r\nnobody  would  dare suggest or say who  should  be  the\r\n\r\nChancellor.  That is something which should  be  looked\r\n\r\ninto.  If the Minister for Education thinks that it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to provide for the post of Chancellor as well\r\n\r\nin  the  Ordinance, then I will welcome it  very  much.\r\n\r\nThis  is  one defect in the present Ordinance  which  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the donations to Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  I  have some queries  to  air  also.  When\r\n\r\nNanyang  University was first set up, members  of'  the\r\n\r\npublic  in all walks of life promised various  sums  as\r\n\r\ndonations  to the Nanyang University Fund. But  so  far\r\n\r\nnot  all  the  donations promised have been  collected.\r\n\r\nWithout further information, it is not possible for the\r\n\r\npublic  to know who have or who have not paid the  sums\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  promised to give to Nantah.  This  is\r\n\r\nsomething to which the Government should pay attention.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to know what measures the  authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned  will take with regard to the  collection  of\r\n\r\nsuch promised donations in order to augment the Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  Fund for the maintenance of the running  of\r\n\r\nthe University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that whenever we talk about Nantah,\r\n\r\nit  is inevitable that we also think about the question\r\n\r\nof  the recognition of Nanyang University degrees.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has promised on many occasions that it would\r\n\r\naid  Nanyang  University and it has  allotted  quite  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of money to it. Members of the public  are\r\n\r\nstill  looking  forward  to  the  day  when  those  who\r\n\r\npromised  donations  to Nanyang  University  will  come\r\n\r\nforward to fulfil their promises. Many people are  also\r\n\r\nawaiting the day when the Government will come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout openly and say that Nanyang University degrees will\r\n\r\nbe  recognised  by  the Government.  According  to  the\r\n\r\npresent  rate  of  progress of Nanyang University,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can draw up its plan for the recognition  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University degrees and members of  the  public\r\n\r\nare waiting for this question to be answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore becoming an independent  Republic,  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the Nanyang University (Amendment) Bill\r\n\r\nis  necessary.  There are anti-national  elements  with\r\n\r\nulterior motives who make use of this amendment Bill as\r\n\r\na  pretext  to  accuse  the Government  of  wanting  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  Chinese  education and of  trying  to  further\r\n\r\ncontrol  Nanyang University. All these accusations  are\r\n\r\ngroundless. In fact, the people of Singapore know  what\r\n\r\nkind of people they are who say such things. It is very\r\n\r\nobvious  from the statement of the Minister of  Defence\r\n\r\nthat  all these accusations are made by only a minority\r\n\r\nwho  are  anti-national elements  and  who  have  close\r\n\r\nrelationship with the anti-national Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore know very\r\n\r\nwell that the Government is implementing the policy  of\r\n\r\nequal  treatment to all the four streams of  education.\r\n\r\nIt is allotting large sums of money for the development\r\n\r\nand promotion of the four streams of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also allotted large sums of money to aid\r\n\r\nNanyang  University, such as the building of a Library.\r\n\r\nAll  this  goes  to show that the Government  does  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  against  Nanyang  University.  In   other\r\n\r\nwords,  this  shows  that  the Government  is  actually\r\n\r\npromoting  Chinese  education by actual  deeds.  It  is\r\n\r\nproof  that the Government is looking after the highest\r\n\r\nChinese educational institution --- Nanyang University.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  correct attitude taken by a  responsible\r\n\r\nGovernment. This attitude and action on the part of the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore should be supported and praised\r\n\r\nby all conscientious people. Therefore, the accusations\r\n\r\nby the anti-national elements with ulterior motives are\r\n\r\npuerile and sheer nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present problem facing Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity is how to raise its academic standard. After\r\n\r\nthe passage of the Nanyang University (Amendment) Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich is now before the House, I hope that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education will adopt quicker measures to  implement\r\n\r\nthe  various recommendations of the Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nReform Committee, such as the revision of salaries  and\r\n\r\nbetter  working  conditions of the  teaching  staff  in\r\n\r\norder  to enable the teachers, professors and lecturers\r\n\r\nto  devote more time and energy to raising the academic\r\n\r\nstandards  of  the students so that they will  be  well\r\n\r\neducated  and be able to contribute to nation-building.\r\n\r\nThere  is a great difference between the salary  scales\r\n\r\nof  the teachers of Nanyang University and those of the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore. There is a saying that we want\r\n\r\nthe  horse to run well, but we also want it not to  eat\r\n\r\nany  grass.  How  is it possible? I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  will  look into the working  conditions  and\r\n\r\nsalaries  of the teaching staff whilst he is  promoting\r\n\r\nChinese education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise   in   full  support  of  the  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University was first conceived in 1953 and it\r\n\r\nstarted  classes  in  1956. Its  inception  took  place\r\n\r\nduring  the colonial days under circumstances in  which\r\n\r\nmany  obstructions were placed by the colonial masters.\r\n\r\nDespite  this, people from all walks of life in  Malaya\r\n\r\nand    Singapore   donated   generously   towards   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of Nanyang University. Its main objective\r\n\r\nwas  to  pave the way for further studies for graduates\r\n\r\nof  secondary schools. The second objective, of course,\r\n\r\nwas to provide a source of teaching staff for secondary\r\n\r\nschools.  The third objective was intended to link  the\r\n\r\noriental  and occidental cultures and also  to  develop\r\n\r\nMalayan culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the establishment of Nanyang University,\r\n\r\nthe  organisation of this University was run by  multi-millionaires  and very rich businessmen. Although  they\r\n\r\nwere enthusiastic in this pursuit,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  is  praiseworthy,  they  lacked  experience   in\r\n\r\nrunning  an  academic  institution.  They  managed  the\r\n\r\nUniversity as though they were doing business in a  big\r\n\r\nenterprise. Because of this, and owing to various other\r\n\r\nfactors  which presented a lot of problems  to  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity, there was a lack of Chinese scholars coming\r\n\r\nforward during the initial stages to give the necessary\r\n\r\nassistance and guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly and undeniably, Mr Speaker, over the\r\n\r\npast  10  years  of  its existence, Nantah  has  indeed\r\n\r\ntrained  and  fostered great talent in various  fields,\r\n\r\nsuch  as commerce, education, industry, etc. But in  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  the  organisation  and  structure  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  the economic problem, and the question  of\r\n\r\nacademic  staff are concerned, Nanyang University  lags\r\n\r\nfar  behind  any other university. The main  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  University Council is improperly  organised.\r\n\r\nThe  second  reason is that there has  been  no  expert\r\n\r\nscholar  to  fill  the role of Vice-Chancellor  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  ever since its inception. Mr Speaker,  you\r\n\r\nwill  agree  with  me that these two factors  are  very\r\n\r\nessential to a university.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the reorganisation of Nanyang University, the\r\n\r\nmain  powers of the Nanyang University Council  lay  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands of Mr Tan Lark Sye. He was the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  University Council. Mr Tan, of course, is a  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful  businessman, but I am afraid he knows  next\r\n\r\nto nothing about the organisation and administration of\r\n\r\na university and university education. Because of this,\r\n\r\nhe  had  to rely on some useless, good-for-nothing  and\r\n\r\nincompetent  followers of his to run the University  in\r\n\r\nso far as administration was concerned. For example, in\r\n\r\nthe   administrative  structure  of   the   University,\r\n\r\nalthough there existed an Executive Committee which was\r\n\r\nthe supreme administrative organ of the University, the\r\n\r\nUniversity  authorities appointed a Secretary  who  was\r\n\r\ndirectly responsible to Mr Tan Lark Sye. The powers of\r\n\r\nthe   Secretary  included  the  control  of   financial\r\n\r\naffairs, the academic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstaff,   their   recruitment   and   dismissals,    the\r\n\r\nadministration  and  policy making of  the  University.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  such wide controls, he became in  practice\r\n\r\nthe un-crowned emperor of the University. His followers\r\n\r\nheld key positions in Nanyang University, and they  had\r\n\r\nno  regard for the sacred mission of the University  as\r\n\r\nsuch.  Because  of  this, the organisation  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  was such that people who were  capable  and\r\n\r\nscholarly were reluctant to continue serving under  the\r\n\r\nunlearned,  useless and good-for-nothing leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe  incompetent  followers. And even  those  who  were\r\n\r\nquite  prepared to stay on only stayed on for  a  while\r\n\r\nbecause  they  could  not tolerate  these  unreasonable\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  And those who had come to  serve  would\r\n\r\nnot  think  of  staying on for long.  Of  course,  this\r\n\r\naffected  the  treatment and the pay structure  of  the\r\n\r\nacademic  staff,  which accounted for the  University's\r\n\r\nfailure  to  get  internationally reputed  scholars  to\r\n\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have already said, the powers of\r\n\r\nthe Secretary conflicted with the administration of the\r\n\r\nExecutive  Committee, and this conflict  brought  about\r\n\r\nthe  Prescott  Commission Report which  took  away  the\r\n\r\ntenure  of office and the powers of the Secretary,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of the Executive Committee had to resign.\r\n\r\nThis,  of course, was very, very comforting to  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity and it gave a ray of light, a hopeful  light\r\n\r\nindeed,  to  Nanyang University. So at that  time  when\r\n\r\npeople  from all walks of life were very confident  and\r\n\r\nhopeful  about Nanyang University, it failed  again  in\r\n\r\nthe selection of proper personnel in the administrative\r\n\r\nand   executive  fields.  And  so  Nanyang   University\r\n\r\nunderwent another chaotic state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the loose organisation of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  and its incompetent administration  can  be\r\n\r\nlikened  to  a  crumbling feudalistic  structure  which\r\n\r\nprovides  good opportunities to pro-Communist elements.\r\n\r\nUnder  those  circumstances, pro-Communist cadres  took\r\n\r\nover Nanyang University; they were well trained people.\r\n\r\nBecause the Nanyang University Students' Union had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall along been controlled by the pro-Communist students\r\n\r\nwho  knew  that the University could be manipulated  at\r\n\r\ntheir  will, these pro-Communist students had  complete\r\n\r\ndisregard for discipline in the University campus. They\r\n\r\ntook Nanyang University as a hotbed for the training of\r\n\r\nCommunist   cadres.  Through  the  Nanyang   University\r\n\r\nStudents' Union they propagated Communist ideology  and\r\n\r\nideas.  They  even  made use of  the  property  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  for  illegal activities. In the  University\r\n\r\nitself these pro-Communist students had no respect  for\r\n\r\nlaw   and  discipline.  They  beat  up  students   with\r\n\r\ndifferent   ideologies,  and  because  of   this,   the\r\n\r\nsituation was very, very unsatisfactory. They even went\r\n\r\nso  far as to coerce the authorities to fine or dismiss\r\n\r\nthose students who dared to oppose them. These students\r\n\r\nwasted  their  time  doing  other  things  instead   of\r\n\r\nstudying. They failed in their examinations as a matter\r\n\r\nof  course,  and  because of that they  threatened  the\r\n\r\nlecturers  and teachers, asking them to  pass  them  in\r\n\r\ntheir examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since 1961 these pro-Communist students\r\n\r\nblatantly   linked   themselves  with   the   Communist\r\n\r\norganisations outside the campus and formed a  united\r\n\r\nfront for activities against the nation. They even held\r\n\r\npolitical meetings in the campus of the University  and\r\n\r\ncarted a lot of workers and other students to break  up\r\n\r\nthe   peaceful  atmosphere  of  study  in  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  campus.  They  brought  politics  into  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  campus.  As a result, Nanyang  University  was\r\n\r\ndrawn  into  the  political vortex. Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nsuffered in its reputation. It was unable to live up to\r\n\r\nthe  hopes  of  people from all walks of life  who  had\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  its  future.  As  a  result   of   such\r\n\r\nshattering  of their confidence, the future of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity   and   the  students  was  also   adversely\r\n\r\naffected,  and  members  of  the  public  had  a  wrong\r\n\r\nimpression of the University. So the innocent  students\r\n\r\nsuffered.  This  is  a very sad situation  indeed,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Because of a small group of extreme  elements\r\n\r\nwho  were pro-Communist and who had no love for Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity, Nanyang University was used for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  evil  political purposes of certain people.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  really  love Nanyang University are  the  studious\r\n\r\nstudents  and  generous donors from  various  walks  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the duty of a responsible elected\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the people to guide the  University  in\r\n\r\nhealthy  and  good  development.  The  Government   has\r\n\r\ntherefore   taken  the  initiative  to   help   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  reorganise  in  this  direction.  This   is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  It  also  helps in the realisation  of  the\r\n\r\nhopes  of  those  who have contributed  financially  to\r\n\r\nNanyang  University so that it may not  fall  into  the\r\n\r\nhands  and continue to be in the hands of the Communist\r\n\r\ncadres.  The  Singapore Government has shouldered  this\r\n\r\ngreat  responsibility. It has already  taken  steps  to\r\n\r\nreorganise  Nanyang University. It has got rid  of  the\r\n\r\nundesirable  elements. It has given Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nthe   necessary   financial  support.   It   has   made\r\n\r\nadjustments  in the pay and treatment of  the  teaching\r\n\r\nstaff   and   increase   the  facilities   of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  such  as  the  new  library  and   science\r\n\r\nequipment.   Within  a  short  period   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   given  $6.7   million   to   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  This, of course, is a praise-worthy  move.\r\n\r\nIt shows that the Government is paying attention to the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the University. I hope  that  it  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to do this, and I also hope that people  from\r\n\r\nvarious walks of life will, in the same spirit as  they\r\n\r\nhave  helped  Nanyang University,  continue  to  donate\r\n\r\ngenerously from now on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the aim of the Nanyang University\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill is to strengthen the organisation  of\r\n\r\nthe  University  Council to implement more  effectively\r\n\r\nthe  development of the University. The  membership  of\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang  University Council includes  people  from\r\n\r\nvarious  strata of society, such as representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  the  University,  and  the  Graduates\r\n\r\nOrganisation, and well-wishers, some of whom come  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  An  organisation on this  basis  is  a  very\r\n\r\nreasonable   and  enlightened  one,  as   the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity Graduates Fellowship had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade it clear in a statement on the 26th of October  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because of the past and the future necessity of the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  to  foster more  effectively  high\r\n\r\ntalents  for the nation, it is necessary to set  up  as\r\n\r\nearly  as  possible an effective central administrative\r\n\r\norganisation   so  that  all  such   matters   as   the\r\n\r\nadministration, curricula and academic  standards  will\r\n\r\nbe well taken care of, including the matter relating to\r\n\r\nthe salaries of the teaching staff. Such changes in the\r\n\r\norganisation  of the Council and in certain  names  are\r\n\r\nalso  in  keeping with this spirit without any harm  to\r\n\r\nthe University organisation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote one more extract to conclude my\r\n\r\nspeech, Mr Speaker. From the same Fellowship, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As one of the highest educational institutions of\r\n\r\nour  country, the Nanyang University will shoulder  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities for the further education and  studies\r\n\r\nof Chinese secondary graduates.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, as one who has been educated in Chinese, I  am\r\n\r\nvery  concerned  with the highest of  Chinese  academic\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  namely, Nantah. When Singapore  achieved\r\n\r\nindependence, members of the public had high  hopes  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University. Everybody thought that it was  the\r\n\r\nhighest  expression in higher education. It is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  supports of our society. It is everyone's duty  to\r\n\r\ngive  encouragement  and support to Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nbecause this institution is a very important factor  in\r\n\r\nour  society.  They all hope that the  University  will\r\n\r\nprovide  opportunities and facilities for  students  so\r\n\r\nthat  in  future  they can put what they  have  already\r\n\r\nlearnt in the University at the service of society.  In\r\n\r\nview  of  this,  the previous University  Council  have\r\n\r\nrequested  the Minister for Education and  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity authorities to make a careful study  of  the\r\n\r\nNanyang   University  organisation  and   the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity   Ordinance.  They   have   formulated   and\r\n\r\nrecommended amendments to the original Ordinance  which\r\n\r\nare  now  before the House. We all remember that  under\r\n\r\nthe    Nanyang   University   Ordinance,   1959,    its\r\n\r\norganisation  and composition are not in  keeping  with\r\n\r\nthe present requirements and time.

Otherwise  a few anti-national  elements\r\n\r\nwould  be  able to manipulate the organisation  and  to\r\n\r\ninfiltrate  into  this Council because  foreigners  can\r\n\r\ncome  into  it  and manipulate it to  carry  out  their\r\n\r\nnefarious subversive activities. On the other hand,  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  encourage those who really  love  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity and Chinese education to be in this Council.\r\n\r\nI  therefore  support  the  present  amendment  to  the\r\n\r\ncomposition  of the Council which inter  alia  provides\r\n\r\nfor  six members to be appointed by the Government,  of\r\n\r\nwhom  three  may be members resident outside Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut  I feel that in the composition of the Council they\r\n\r\nhave  neglected representatives from the working class.\r\n\r\nIn   other  words,  there  is  no  provision  for  such\r\n\r\nrepresentatives on-the Council. The Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nFund  is  made up of donations from people  in  various\r\n\r\nwalks  of life, including taxi-drivers, trishaw  riders\r\n\r\nand  workers. They have shown great enthusiasm in their\r\n\r\nsupport of Chinese education and Nantah. Therefore,  in\r\n\r\nthe  new  Council in the amendment Bill,  I  feel  that\r\n\r\nclause   7  (1)  (e)  should  be  amended  to   include\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  the  working  class,   say   the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. With such an amendment, I feel the composition\r\n\r\nof  the  Council  will be perfect, more effective,  and\r\n\r\nmore  representative  and, as a  result,  will  have  a\r\n\r\ngreater  contribution to make to the future of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  The  few undisciplined students  who  hold\r\n\r\ntheir   teachers   in  contempt,  who  have   destroyed\r\n\r\nUniversity property and have carried out nefarious acts\r\n\r\nof vandalism, will be wiped out, so that those students\r\n\r\nwho  are really sincere in their further studies in the\r\n\r\ncourse of the next four\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nyears  may be enabled to pursue their studies in  peace\r\n\r\nand in a better environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   I   rise  to  support  the  Nanyang   University\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill. As what the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nto the Minister for National Development has said, ever\r\n\r\nsince   its  inception  Nanyang  University  has   been\r\n\r\nbedeviled by defective organisation, bad administration\r\n\r\nand ignorance of the University Council. The top policy-making  body,  the  Nanyang  University  Council,  knew\r\n\r\nnothing about University education. Therefore,  it  was\r\n\r\npossible  for the Communists and pro-Communist students\r\n\r\nto  make Nanyang University a breeding-ground for their\r\n\r\ncadres and to exploit Nanyang University for their anti-national activities and evil purposes and to bring down\r\n\r\nthe  name  of the University. In order to make  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity a real institution of higher learning -  and\r\n\r\nthis  is the hope of all who love Nanyang University  -\r\n\r\nthey  will agree that it is necessary to wipe  out  the\r\n\r\ninfluence  of these pro-Communist elements as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.   Only  thus  is  it  possible  for   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  to  provide peaceful surroundings  for  the\r\n\r\nstudents to pursue their knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me quote a speech made by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education on the 20th December last  year\r\n\r\nin this House. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Universities represent the apex of the educational\r\n\r\nsystem  in  a  country.  They  have  an  essential  and\r\n\r\ninfluential  role  in  society,  and  the  quality  and\r\n\r\ncharacter  of  the  universities  are  bound  to   have\r\n\r\nimportant   impacts  on  the  social,   economic,   and\r\n\r\npolitical life of a country. The role and character  of\r\n\r\nuniversities have varied from place to place  and  from\r\n\r\ntime   to   time.   Universities   are   simultaneously\r\n\r\nconservative    and    progressive    institutions    -\r\n\r\nconservative in the sense that they preserve  the  best\r\n\r\nin  the  culture of a society, and progressive  in  the\r\n\r\nsense  that  they introduce new ideas, new discoveries,\r\n\r\nand  new  inventions,  usually for  the  betterment  of\r\n\r\nsociety.    As   institutions   of   higher   learning,\r\n\r\nuniversities throughout the world share certain  common\r\n\r\nfunctions,  but they differ also because they  have  to\r\n\r\ncater  for  the  different needs of the  societies  for\r\n\r\nwhich they purport to serve. It is obvious that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuniversities  in  homogeneous societies  with  a  well-developed sense of national identity have one important\r\n\r\ndifference in role to play from universities  in  newly\r\n\r\nindependent  countries  faced  with  the  problems   of\r\n\r\nbuilding  national  identity  out  of  a  heterogeneous\r\n\r\npopulation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech I have just quoted refers to higher\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  learning  in  general,  but   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  ever since its inception,  and  especially\r\n\r\nsince  the publication of the Wang Gung-Wu Report,  has\r\n\r\nagain  and again emphasised that the Nanyang University\r\n\r\nstudents  should  be at least bilingual,  if  not  tri-lingual, and be able to fulfil the special needs of the\r\n\r\nsociety they will have to serve. Mr Speaker, Sir,  all\r\n\r\nthe  past  facts have shown that the Nanyang University\r\n\r\nstudents  have  distinguished  themselves  in  service.\r\n\r\nAlthough  they  have  come from a different  stream  of\r\n\r\neducation,  their loyalty, their patriotism  and  their\r\n\r\nwork are no less excellent than those of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since the founding of the\r\n\r\nUniversity, people from all walks of life in Malaya and\r\n\r\nSingapore   have   contributed   generously   to    the\r\n\r\nUniversity, especially people from the middle and lower\r\n\r\nstrata.  But  what  is deplorable  is  that  this  non-Government  University, ever since its  inception,  has\r\n\r\npassed  into  the  hands of those evil-doers  who  have\r\n\r\nulterior  designs and these elements,  because  of  the\r\n\r\nsupport  given  by certain rich business tycoons,  were\r\n\r\nable  to  carry out their evil deeds in the  University\r\n\r\nand  land  it in a mess. The control of the  University\r\n\r\npassed  into  the  hands of certain multi-millionaires.\r\n\r\nThese  people knew nothing about university  education.\r\n\r\nThey  thought that money is everything. But  they  have\r\n\r\nforgotten the old maxim: \"To die of hunger is  a  small\r\n\r\nmatter,  but  to  succumb to  evil  forces  is  a  real\r\n\r\ndisgrace.\"  Many  people  with academic  qualifications\r\n\r\nwere  hesitant in coming to the University.  Those  who\r\n\r\ndid  come  very  soon left. What is absurd  is  that  a\r\n\r\ngeneral meeting - they have a membership of 1,500  -had\r\n\r\nnot been convened even once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reason why I have quoted so many\r\n\r\nexamples  is  that I wish to show that because  of  the\r\n\r\nincompetence of the people in charge of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  University, it was possible for the pro-Communists\r\n\r\nto  infiltrate  into the University. By their  actions,\r\n\r\nthey brought down the name of the University and landed\r\n\r\nit  into difficulties. Teachers, administrators and the\r\n\r\nleadership  were surrounded by pro-Communist  elements.\r\n\r\nThey  made  use  of  the  University  campus  as  their\r\n\r\ntraining  ground  to  carry out their  evil  deeds  and\r\n\r\nnefarious  designs. These people profess  to  love  the\r\n\r\nUniversity,  but,  in  actual  fact,  they  have   been\r\n\r\nindulging  in acts of vandalism by damaging  University\r\n\r\nproperty  and  burning down University buildings,  thus\r\n\r\nmaking  it necessary for the University authorities  to\r\n\r\nspend  a  large sum of money on repairing the building.\r\n\r\nIs  this the behaviour of one who loves the University?\r\n\r\nThis  only  worsens  the  financial  position  of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since its inception in 1953,\r\n\r\nmany  people  have made generous contributions  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity,  ranging  from  hundreds  of  thousands  to\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars. But the actual amount collected is\r\n\r\nonly $12 million. If this sum is compared to the amount\r\n\r\ncontributed by the Government, it is very insignificant\r\n\r\nindeed. The Government has contributed $6.7 million  in\r\n\r\na  short  period.  The  people  donated  money  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  because they love it and pay a high  regard\r\n\r\nto  the  sacred task of education. It was  because  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  members  did not set a good example  that  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of  money  was  made  very  difficult.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  Mr Tan Lark Sye, who promised to  donate  $5\r\n\r\nmillion,  actually  paid  up  only  $2.5  million.  The\r\n\r\nHokkien  Huay Kuan promised to donate $600,000 for  the\r\n\r\nerection  of  an  auditorium,  but  the  actual  amount\r\n\r\ncollected was only $200,000. The Nanyang Siang Pau  Co.\r\n\r\nLtd, promised  to donate $1 million,  but  the  actual\r\n\r\namount  collected was only $94,000. Another reason  was\r\n\r\nthat the University was in a topsy-turvy condition  and\r\n\r\ncontrol  of it had passed into the hands of  the  anti-national  elements, and the future  of  Nantah  was  in\r\n\r\ndanger. Therefore, these people did not pay up the full\r\n\r\namount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University is a non-government institution.\r\n\r\nApart  from  the  grant by the Government,  it  has  to\r\n\r\nreceive support from the public. Ever since the  wiping\r\n\r\nout   of   the  pro-Communist  anti-national  elements,\r\n\r\nNanyang  University has been put on a  proper  footing,\r\n\r\nespecially in view of this amending Bill. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nappeal  to  those who love education and the University\r\n\r\nto  keep  their  word  and pay up all  that  they  have\r\n\r\npromised  to  donate. This will be  beneficial  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  University  and  to  society   in\r\n\r\ngeneral. To all people from all walks of life,  I  make\r\n\r\nthis  appeal - that they should continue their  support\r\n\r\nfor  Nanyang University. Although the University is now\r\n\r\nreceiving  aid from Government, it does not  mean  that\r\n\r\nthe  people  should stop giving aid to it.  With  ample\r\n\r\nfinance it can be managed in a better way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the pro-Communist elements thought\r\n\r\nthat  as the University was founded by people from  all\r\n\r\nparts of Malaysia, people outside Singapore should have\r\n\r\nmore  say and control in the running of the University.\r\n\r\nThis   is   absurd.  Because  of  different   political\r\n\r\nsituations,  the citizens in Singapore  should  have  a\r\n\r\nbigger   say  and  control  in  the  running   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity. This is only proper and is in keeping  with\r\n\r\nour  national interest. But, at the same time, we  will\r\n\r\nallow  Malaysian  citizens to play  their  part  within\r\n\r\ncertain limits. This is provided in the amendment which\r\n\r\nallows   for  three  Council  members  from   Malaysian\r\n\r\nterritory.  We  also welcome people  outside  Singapore\r\n\r\ngiving   aid  and  constructive  suggestions   to   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  and their continued support. The  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment and people are now subsidising about  $1,300\r\n\r\nfor  every outside student per year. In spite of  that,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  still welcomes genuine  students  from\r\n\r\nabroad  to  study here. At the same time,  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian   Government   will  discard   their   narrow\r\n\r\nracialist   ideology.   They  should   absorb   Nanyang\r\n\r\ngraduates into their Government departments just as the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government is doing. If they  can  do  this,\r\n\r\nthen  we can say that the Malaysian Government  is  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminating  against  Chinese  education.  I   fully\r\n\r\nsupport this amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nI  think it is hardly necessary for me to argue further\r\n\r\nthe  case for the amendment Bill. The support given  to\r\n\r\nit  by  Members  of this House, particularly  from  the\r\n\r\nformer   graduates  of  Nanyang  University,  is   most\r\n\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government realise that the present amendments to\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang University Ordinance are inadequate. There\r\n\r\nare,  in  fact,  many other sections of  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nrequiring   suitable   amendments   to   make   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  and its Council function more  efficiently.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the present amendments are what the  existing\r\n\r\nCouncil  is  prepared  to accept to  avoid  unnecessary\r\n\r\nsuspicion from certain sections of the public who might\r\n\r\nstill  be  fearful that the character of the University\r\n\r\nmight  be altered. However, the Government shall always\r\n\r\nkeep  in touch with the future Council to ensure  that,\r\n\r\nshould  further amendments be necessary, these will  be\r\n\r\nbrought  up  for  consideration in this  House  at  the\r\n\r\nappropriate time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has made certain\r\n\r\nreferences  to the composition of the Council  and  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty in calling for a general meeting of  members\r\n\r\nto  elect from amongst themselves three members to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil. These difficulties have been envisaged, but  I\r\n\r\nam  sure the Council will be able to sort them  out  by\r\n\r\nintroducing  new regulations, if necessary,  to  govern\r\n\r\nthe conduct and procedure of such general meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has also mentioned that we\r\n\r\nhave  been  too concerned with the status of the  Vice-Chancellor  in  this  present  amendment  Bill  to  the\r\n\r\nneglect of the Chancellor. However, section 12  (1)  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing  Ordinance has already provided  for  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Council  to  be  the  head  of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity, and as such the provision for the  post  of\r\n\r\nChancellor is unnecessary at this stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also raised the question of\r\n\r\ncontributions  from  members of  the  public  who  have\r\n\r\npledged various sums at various times in the course  of\r\n\r\nthe history of the University. If he will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntable a question on this subject in this House, I shall\r\n\r\nattempt to get the relevant information for him.  Right\r\n\r\nat this moment I have no such information at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as anxious as the Member that the question of\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  Nanyang University degrees  should  be\r\n\r\nresolved as soon as possible. In fact, last year I  did\r\n\r\nmention  that the Government would consider recognising\r\n\r\nNanyang University degrees in about three years'  time.\r\n\r\nI  think  the  more important question is  whether  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  will be given the opportunity to reorganise\r\n\r\nwithout  being interrupted by pro-Communist  agitation,\r\n\r\nand  whether  the  quality of the  staff  can  also  be\r\n\r\nimproved.  In my view, if Nanyang University  could  be\r\n\r\nreorganised  without  any  interruption  and  both  the\r\n\r\nquality of the staff and the students could be improved\r\n\r\n- and I think it could, which would lead to the raising\r\n\r\nof  the  academic  standard  -  then  the  question  of\r\n\r\nrecognition  could  come  in a  matter  of  two  years,\r\n\r\nperhaps three.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has brought up the question\r\n\r\nof  salaries  for  the  staff  of  Nanyang  University.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he is not aware that since 1966 we have  raised\r\n\r\nthe  salaries of the staff of Nanyang University to the\r\n\r\nsame  level  as  that obtaining in  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since then the University of Singapore has\r\n\r\nhad another revision to their salaries to bring them in\r\n\r\nline  with  the  salary  scales now  obtaining  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya. Therefore, the present  salaries\r\n\r\nof  the  Nanyang University staff are not as attractive\r\n\r\nas those of the University of Singapore. However, these\r\n\r\ndisparities  can be put right as soon as  the  time  is\r\n\r\nappropriate. What Nanyang University lacks, of  course,\r\n\r\nis a gratuity scheme for its staff, and on this subject\r\n\r\nI  think Government is always prepared to consider  any\r\n\r\nsuitable suggestions from Nanyang University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has mentioned that there is\r\n\r\nno provision for representation from the workers on the\r\n\r\nUniversity  Council. Although no specific provision  is\r\n\r\nmade   for   a   representative  from   the   N.T.U.C.,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, the amendment to section 19 (1) (e)  does\r\n\r\nnot  preclude  nomination of a  representative  of  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. if  he  is noted for his interest  in  higher\r\n\r\neducation for workers.

The\r\n\r\nrequest  of the Association has been made too late  for\r\n\r\nme  to raise the matter during Question Time, and  that\r\n\r\nis the reason for my present adjournment speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association has also attached to its letter to me\r\n\r\na copy of the letter dated 2nd November, 1966, which it\r\n\r\nhas  previously  sent to the Director  of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department and to the Minister for  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational  Development. Whatever may be the  reason  for\r\n\r\nthe  Association  to request my service  to  place  its\r\n\r\ngrievances before this House only shortly after it  has\r\n\r\nmade  representation  to  the Department  and  Ministry\r\n\r\nresponsible for the resettlement of the farmers,  I  am\r\n\r\nin  no position to comment. But the three points raised\r\n\r\nby the Association in its letter relate to an important\r\n\r\nand  interesting  aspect of any public  administration,\r\n\r\nthat  is, the particular application or execution of  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  policy of the Government by the department  or\r\n\r\nstatutory body charged with the administration of  such\r\n\r\npolicy. For this reason alone, if not for any other,  I\r\n\r\nconsider  it  most  appropriate that  these  grievances\r\n\r\nshould be aired before this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point raised by the Association in the\r\n\r\nletter  mentioned earlier is that many of  its  farmers\r\n\r\nhave been adversely affected by the Government's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nindustrial and housing projects. But before any  Member\r\n\r\nof  the House jumps to any hasty conclusion, let me add\r\n\r\nthat the Association is not grumbling about the farmers\r\n\r\nliterally  standing in the way of progress. It  appears\r\n\r\nthat  these farmers did not own the land on which  they\r\n\r\nhave  been working. Such land was invariably State land\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have been allowed to farm under  Temporary\r\n\r\nOccupation Licences. Under the terms of these Temporary\r\n\r\nOccupation Licences, or T.O.L.s, as they are  popularly\r\n\r\nknown,  for which nominal fees are payable, the farmers\r\n\r\nhave to vacate possession of the land on demand by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Because of the rapid pace of  Government's\r\n\r\nindustrial  and housing development, those farmers  who\r\n\r\nhave  been unfortunate enough to occupy State  land  in\r\n\r\ncertain  areas  which  are marked out  for  development\r\n\r\npurposes, have to vacate possession of their respective\r\n\r\npieces  of  land  on  which they may  have  worked  for\r\n\r\nseveral  years and start all over again on fresh  plots\r\n\r\nof  land.  In  this  respect, I must  congratulate  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  its  human  gesture  in  providing   an\r\n\r\nalternative site to the farmers so requested to  vacate\r\n\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snag is that on the previous sites most of these\r\n\r\nfarmers have been occupying areas of several acres. But\r\n\r\non  resettlement they are only allocated areas  of  not\r\n\r\nmore than two acres. Some farmers may even be allocated\r\n\r\npocket-sized plots of land. It may seem strange to  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House that, instead of being  grateful\r\n\r\nfor  being  allocated any land at all, the farmers  are\r\n\r\nnow  carping about the plots of land allocated to them.\r\n\r\nBut  it  must be appreciated by this House  that  these\r\n\r\nfarmers  are  mostly  breeders  of  poultry  and  pigs,\r\n\r\nparticularly of the foreign or cross-bred variety. Such\r\n\r\npoultry  and  pigs are less hardy than  the pure  local\r\n\r\nstrain. Therefore, for the successful rearing  of  the\r\n\r\nforeign  or  cross-bred variety of poultry,  a  certain\r\n\r\nminimum  standard of hygienic practices and precautions\r\n\r\nmust  be  adopted.  The  size  of  the  plots  of  land\r\n\r\nallocated  to farmers on resettlement is  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nparamount   importance   to  the   farmers,   because,\r\n\r\ngenerally  speaking, the bigger the size the easier  it\r\n\r\nis to observe the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstandards  of  hygiene in respect of  the  poultry  and\r\n\r\npigs.  The  result  is  that, because  of  the  rigidly\r\n\r\nenforced maximum of two acres of land to be allotted to\r\n\r\neach   resettled  farmer,  who  might  have  previously\r\n\r\noccupied five or six acres, the farmers on resettlement\r\n\r\nhave  no  choice but to cram their flocks of fowls  and\r\n\r\nherds of pigs into the limited space allocated to them.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not require much imagination to realise  that\r\n\r\ncramming  these animals or livestock into a  much  more\r\n\r\nconfined  space  than advisable would have  an  adverse\r\n\r\neffect on the health of the animals. This in turn would\r\n\r\naffect  the volume of production of eggs and  meat  for\r\n\r\nthe market, whether domestic or foreign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effect of a rigid application of the policy\r\n\r\nrestricting each resettled farmer to a maximum  of  two\r\n\r\nacres,  I think, should give rise to grave and  serious\r\n\r\nconcern  not  only to the Government but  also  to  all\r\n\r\npersons who have the interest of Singapore at heart. We\r\n\r\nat present are engaged in an all-out effort to increase\r\n\r\nthe level of productivity. The local rearing of poultry\r\n\r\nand  pigs should play a significant and important  role\r\n\r\nin  this  effort to increase productivity  and  output.\r\n\r\nInstead  of taking a flexible attitude to consider  the\r\n\r\nfarmers'  plight,  our Government policy  is  so  rigid\r\n\r\nwhere it does not warrant rigidity. For example, in the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance,  they are  so  very  liberal  in\r\n\r\nissuing bar licences - but here they are so rigid.  The\r\n\r\nbigger  the  volume of our local production of  poultry\r\n\r\nand  pigs  and  associated  products,  the  lesser  the\r\n\r\ndependence  of  Singapore on other countries  for  such\r\n\r\ncommodities. One obvious effect of such minimisation in\r\n\r\nour  import of poultry and pigs would mean a saving  in\r\n\r\nour foreign exchange reserves, a saving which is not to\r\n\r\nbe  sneezed  at  in the present context of  Singapore's\r\n\r\npolitical and economic circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Association has requested me to bring to the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Members of this House is whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can reconsider this policy of allocating  a\r\n\r\nmaximum   of   only  two  acres  per  farmer   on   the\r\n\r\nresettlement of such farmers. I am given to  understand\r\n\r\nthat this policy of the Government is well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfounded  on  the fact that land is a scarcity  item  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and that there is a limit to the  amount  of\r\n\r\nState  land  which  the Government can  set  aside  for\r\n\r\nfarming   purposes.   On  the  surface,   the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment policy appears to be reasonable and  logical\r\n\r\nin  the circumstances. I wish to assure you Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House that I have no doubt in that respect. But  I\r\n\r\nam inclined to wonder whether this present policy which\r\n\r\nhas  been rigidly applied or enforced by the department\r\n\r\nor statutory body concerned with the allocation of land\r\n\r\nto  resettled farmers can be rendered more flexible  in\r\n\r\nits  application. This would become more evident in the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  the next point which I intend to  bring  to\r\n\r\nyour attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of the Association's grievances is\r\n\r\nthat,  because some farmers on resettlement  find  that\r\n\r\nthe  land  allocated to them is insufficient for  their\r\n\r\nneeds, they are forced to obtain an extra plot of  land\r\n\r\nfrom  other  farmers who do not require all  the  whole\r\n\r\npieces of land allocated to them. The complaint of  the\r\n\r\nAssociation is that those farmers who managed to obtain\r\n\r\nadditional plots of land in this manner have  found  to\r\n\r\ntheir astonishment that, after the transfer of land has\r\n\r\nbeen arranged and completed, they have to pay T.O.L. or\r\n\r\nTemporary  Occupation Licence fees for such  additional\r\n\r\nplots  of land many times higher than the usual  T.O.L.\r\n\r\nfees   charged  for  those  plots  of  land  originally\r\n\r\nallocated to them. In normal circumstances, the  T.O.L.\r\n\r\nfee  per acre of agricultural State land is either  $15\r\n\r\nor  $30  per  year, depending on the situation  of  the\r\n\r\nland. But when the farmers acquire additional plots  of\r\n\r\nland  from  other farmers, the T.O.L. fee for  land  so\r\n\r\nacquired  ranges between $72 and $160 per acre  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  land where the normal T.O.L. fee is  $15  per\r\n\r\nacre  per year and can be as high as $204 per acre  for\r\n\r\nland  which is normally $30 per acre. While the  amount\r\n\r\nof  increase  may  not  appear very  great  to  us,  it\r\n\r\nrepresents a huge sum to the farmers. The difference of\r\n\r\n$100 in the T.O.L. fees payable by the farmers per acre\r\n\r\nmay  mean a difference between loss and profit  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  who  already  have  other  heavy  expenses  to\r\n\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already mentioned to you, I am aware of\r\n\r\nthis Government policy of restricting the allocation of\r\n\r\nland  to resettled farmers up to a maximum of two acres\r\n\r\nper  farmer  because of the sheer physical scarcity  of\r\n\r\nland in Singapore. I also understand that it is also  a\r\n\r\nnecessary  corollary of such policy for the  Government\r\n\r\nto  adopt  deterrent measures against farmers occupying\r\n\r\nplots  of  land  bigger  than  two  acres  by  charging\r\n\r\nexorbitant premiums or high T.O.L. fees to farmers  who\r\n\r\nwant  to acquire additional plots of land. But the fact\r\n\r\nremains  that  farmers  who  find  the  plots  of  land\r\n\r\nallocated to them insufficient for their needs are able\r\n\r\nto  acquire additional land from other farmers who  are\r\n\r\nallocated  plots  of  land in excess  of  their  actual\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand to be corrected, Sir, if I say that the\r\n\r\npresent  policy of allocating land to resettled farmers\r\n\r\nis on the basis of the mere fact of occupation of State\r\n\r\nland required for development purposes. The departments\r\n\r\nor  authorities concerned with the resettlement of such\r\n\r\nfarmers  do not seem to have considered the possibility\r\n\r\nthat  a  policy  framed on such  a  basis  may  not  be\r\n\r\nequitable  and,  worse  still, may  lead  to  a  highly\r\n\r\nundesirable  situation as that where resettled  farmers\r\n\r\nare  allocated plots of land when they had no intention\r\n\r\nat  all  of carrying on their former farming occupation\r\n\r\nor on so extensive a scale as previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, in the face of the much often repeated\r\n\r\naffirmation that it is the policy not to allocate  more\r\n\r\nthan  two acres of land to resettle farmers because  of\r\n\r\nthe   physical  scarcity  of  land  in  Singapore   for\r\n\r\nagricultural  purposes  or otherwise,  a  farmer  could\r\n\r\nstill be allocated land on resettlement when he has  no\r\n\r\nwish  to  carry  on  farming. It  is  because  of  this\r\n\r\nadministrative  inflexibility in the application  of  a\r\n\r\nsensible  and logical policy of the Government  that  a\r\n\r\nridiculous situation has developed whereby farmers, who\r\n\r\nare  genuinely interested in farming and who found that\r\n\r\nthe plots of land allocated to them on resettlement are\r\n\r\ninsufficient  for their needs, must acquire  additional\r\n\r\nplots of land from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother persons who have been allocated plots of land  in\r\n\r\nexcess of their requirements or who have no longer  any\r\n\r\nintention of carrying on farming after resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By making it prohibitive for the genuine and hard-working farmers to acquire additional plots of land,\r\n\r\nthe  departments  or  authorities responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nadministration of such Government policy are, in  fact,\r\n\r\nobstructing Government policy. If land is as scarce  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   as   it  is  maintained  by  the   relevant\r\n\r\ndepartment  or statutory body, how is it possible  that\r\n\r\npersons  who  are no longer interested in  farming  are\r\n\r\nallocated plots of valuable agricultural land on  their\r\n\r\nresettlement? To me the remedy seems to lie in devising\r\n\r\na  proper system for the allocation of land to  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are interested in carrying on farming, and not  in\r\n\r\nthe  rigid and inflexible adherence to a policy of  not\r\n\r\nallocating more than two acres of land to any resettled\r\n\r\nfarmers,  irrespective  of  the  bona  fides  of  their\r\n\r\nintention or requirement after resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point which the Association has requested me\r\n\r\nto  raise  is  a  general grievance  of  all  livestock\r\n\r\nfarmers   whether  resettled  or  otherwise.  But   the\r\n\r\ngrievance  has been rendered acute in relation  to  the\r\n\r\nresettlement   of   farmers  because   of   the   rigid\r\n\r\napplication  of  the  policy of  restricting  resettled\r\n\r\nfarmers to a maximum of two acres each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that previously farmers were required to\r\n\r\npay only $3 to $5 as planning fees for each unit of pig\r\n\r\nsty and chicken shed built according to plans submitted\r\n\r\nto  and approved by the relevant Government department.\r\n\r\nNow  it  seems that this rate of fee for each unit  has\r\n\r\nbeen  increased to $12. The members of the  Association\r\n\r\nare  understandably  upset by  this  increase  in  fee.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the  limitation  of  land  space  or   the\r\n\r\nirregularity of the contour and layout of the allocated\r\n\r\nland,  or  land  acquired  otherwise  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nresettlement  and rigid application of policy  and  for\r\n\r\nhygienic  reasons, the farmers have to build many  more\r\n\r\nunits of pig sties and chicken sheds than necessary  if\r\n\r\nthey  have not been so rigidly restricted in land  area\r\n\r\non resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, this fee is required for\r\n\r\nadministrative purposes and not as a source of  revenue\r\n\r\nfor the Government. The imposition of such planning fee\r\n\r\nis   to  ensure  that  proper  planning  permission  is\r\n\r\nobtained by farmers before they construct any  pig  sty\r\n\r\nor  chicken  shed.  It is difficult to  understand  why\r\n\r\nthere is a necessity to increase this planning fee. The\r\n\r\nincrease  represents an increase of more than  100  per\r\n\r\ncent  on the old rate which, as I say, may not be  much\r\n\r\nto you and me but it means a lot to the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As farmers are playing a vital role in Singapore's\r\n\r\nstruggle for survival, I think it is only reasonable to\r\n\r\nexpect  that the Government policy is framed or applied\r\n\r\nin such a way that livestock farmers are encouraged and\r\n\r\ninduced  to increase their productivity and output  and\r\n\r\nnot  in such a way as to demoralise them or force  them\r\n\r\nout  of production completely. In the end, it is we the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore who have to pay the price  for  a\r\n\r\npolicy  rigidly  or  unimaginatively  applied  by   the\r\n\r\ndepartment or statutory authority responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nadministration of such policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nours is a country which practises democratic socialism.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the Government is very concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the  farmers. It has set  up  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department in order  to  help  the  farmers\r\n\r\ncarry out their farming activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Bras Basah has aired the\r\n\r\ngrievances  of  those farmers who have been  resettled,\r\n\r\nthat  they  have been given only two acres of  land  on\r\n\r\nresettlement.  This  will cause  some  difficulties  to\r\n\r\nthem.  I realise that our Government is faced with  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of land scarcity. However, I am of the opinion\r\n\r\nthat  although the available land for farming  is  very\r\n\r\nlimited, I still think we should give better protection\r\n\r\nand  consideration  to  those  farmers  who  have  been\r\n\r\naffected  by  our  development  programmes,   as   they\r\n\r\nconstitute  a  very great proportion of our  population\r\n\r\nand have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontributed a lot to the economic welfare of our State.\r\n\r\nThey have contributed about $100 million worth of goods\r\n\r\nto  our  economy. They have produced enough vegetables,\r\n\r\neggs  and  other farming products for export  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  thus earning a lot of foreign exchange  for\r\n\r\nour  country.  Therefore, I believe that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  will agree with me when I say  that  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  allots  a  bigger  piece  of  land  to  the\r\n\r\naffected  farmers  so  as to facilitate  their  farming\r\n\r\nactivities in order to increase their productivity, the\r\n\r\nfarmers will bring greater prosperity to our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as to how to solve the problem of\r\n\r\nland scarcity, I am of the opinion that the departments\r\n\r\nconcerned  should have an overall and  better  plan  in\r\n\r\nallocating  land and developing land in the surrounding\r\n\r\nislands  for  farming purposes, as  enunciated  by  our\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. The land in these surrounding  islands\r\n\r\ncan  be  used  for rearing fishes, ducks  and  for  the\r\n\r\ncultivation  of vegetables. I appreciate that  we  will\r\n\r\nhave to invest a lot of money to develop these islands,\r\n\r\nbut in the long-term interest this is worth doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the exorbitant T.O.L. fees the\r\n\r\nfarmers  have  to pay for their land and  the  planning\r\n\r\nfees.   In   order  to  alleviate  their  burden,   the\r\n\r\ndepartment concerned should give consideration to their\r\n\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point is about those who are not bona fide\r\n\r\nfarmers. These people have some land near their  houses\r\n\r\nand they carry out poultry and other farming activities\r\n\r\nas  a  side-line in order to supplement  their  income.\r\n\r\nThey are also affected by the resettlement schemes, but\r\n\r\nthe  Government should give only accommodation but  not\r\n\r\nany  land to them. Therefore, I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  carry out his policy in a  more  flexible\r\n\r\nway.  These  not bona fide farmers should  be  given  a\r\n\r\nsmall piece of land in order that they can continue  to\r\n\r\nearn   their  customary  income  from  their  side-line\r\n\r\nactivities so as not to suffer any hardship  when  they\r\n\r\nare resettled elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of\r\n\r\nresettlement  not  only affects our farming  population\r\n\r\nbut  also  affects  our economy as a whole.

Whilst   industrialisation\r\n\r\nrightly  demands  our  urgent  attention,  our  farming\r\n\r\npolicy   should   not   be  neglected.   Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nneglected  it appears to be. It is, I should  say,  the\r\n\r\nCinderella  in our Government policy. In acquiring  the\r\n\r\nJurong  site  for industrial development, for  example,\r\n\r\nfarmers  from that area were resettled in the Choa  Chu\r\n\r\nKang Constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> They\r\n\r\nwill vote for you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> They were each allocated a plot of\r\n\r\nland  of  not more than two acres irrespective  of  how\r\n\r\nmuch  land they had been cultivating before,  and  also\r\n\r\nwithout   considering   their   particular   type    of\r\n\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make way for the resettlement of farmers from\r\n\r\nJurong, land in the Choa Chu Kang area was acquired and\r\n\r\nfarmers  who  were  farming on  a  large  scale  before\r\n\r\nsuddenly   found  that  they  had  to   squeeze   their\r\n\r\noperations  into a much smaller plot of  land.  As  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Bras Basah has just said,  most  of  these\r\n\r\nlands were held on T.O.L.s. All the Government did  was\r\n\r\nto  revoke the T.O.L.s, take back the land and re-allot\r\n\r\nto  these resettled farmers a plot of not more than two\r\n\r\nacres.  Let  me give the House an example to illustrate\r\n\r\nmy   point.  In  my  constituency,  there  was  an  old\r\n\r\nestablished poultry farming family rearing chickens  on\r\n\r\na  very  large scale on ten acres of land.  The  annual\r\n\r\nturnover  was  in  the region of $1 million,  and  they\r\n\r\nemployed  a  score or so of farmhands. Because  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's resettlement policy, the land was acquired\r\n\r\nby the Government - in this case the T.O.L. was revoked\r\n\r\n-  and  this family was re-allotted a two-acre plot  of\r\n\r\nland.

As  we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  farming  at the present stage of development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is labour intensive. It is one of  the  ways\r\n\r\nwhich could be explored to create job opportunities.  I\r\n\r\nsubmit,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  properly  developed\r\n\r\nfarming   can   give   tremendous   opportunities   for\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present policy of the Government, however, of\r\n\r\nallotting  a plot of two acres to farmers, irrespective\r\n\r\nof   their   special  circumstances,  is  against   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the farming industry as  a  whole.

As a Member from\r\n\r\na rural constituency, I think it is also my duty to air\r\n\r\nmy views on the same problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was recently elected, I have, within a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  slightly more than one  month,  visited  my\r\n\r\nconstituency  now and then in order to  understand  the\r\n\r\nproblems  affecting the livelihood of the  farmers  and\r\n\r\nvillagers. During these visits, I have discovered  that\r\n\r\nthe  topics  dealt  with by the  Members  are  actually\r\n\r\nrealistic  problems facing the farming population.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Choa Chu Kang has already mentioned that our\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   paying   too   much   attention    to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and neglecting the problems affecting\r\n\r\nthe livelihood of farmers in Singapore. As a result  of\r\n\r\nsuch  neglect,  the  farmers in  the  rural  areas  are\r\n\r\nfinding  it difficult to earn a livelihood without  the\r\n\r\nnecessary care and attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also pointed out that\r\n\r\nthe  farmers in Singapore play an important role in the\r\n\r\neconomy of our nation, because they produce about  $100\r\n\r\nmillion  worth  of farm produce per year.  In  view  of\r\n\r\nthese facts, I would urge the Minister concerned to pay\r\n\r\nmore  attention  and  care to  the  livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of allocation of arable land to\r\n\r\nfarmers  affected  by resettlement, I fully  appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  our  land area is very limited - it is about  225\r\n\r\nsquare miles. But we can think of some other places  to\r\n\r\nprovide our farmers with more arable land. According to\r\n\r\nthe  present  resettlement policy with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nallocation  of  farm land, a maximum of  two  acres  is\r\n\r\nallowed  to each farming household. Members  one  after\r\n\r\nanother  have already pointed out that the  maximum  of\r\n\r\ntwo acres is, in fact, not sufficient for the necessary\r\n\r\nfarming  activities. Although in relation to the  total\r\n\r\narea of our island this allocation is quite reasonable,\r\n\r\nconsideration must be given to deserving cases of bona\r\n\r\nfide farmers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that no land is given to undeserving cases, thereby\r\n\r\ngiving  rise  to  the situation, as  mentioned  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bras Basah, where people who are not totally\r\n\r\ndependent  on  farming for their livelihood  have  been\r\n\r\nallotted  land, whereas those dependent on farming  for\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood  have  been allotted  land  which  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient for them, so that they have  to  get  some\r\n\r\nland  from those who do not need so much land. In  this\r\n\r\nsituation, the people who get land from others have  to\r\n\r\npay higher T.O.L. fees and this, of course, adds to the\r\n\r\nburden of the farmers. In my own constituency, there is\r\n\r\na  similar  example.  I  have a  farmer  who  has  been\r\n\r\nresettled  at  Choa Chu Kang and his T.O.L. fees  have\r\n\r\nbeen  increased from $7 to $408 per year.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of many times the original amount, which  is,\r\n\r\nof  course,  a great burden on the farmer concerned.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister will give serious consideration  to\r\n\r\nthe problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that we must develop and we\r\n\r\ncannot   remain  in  a  backward  state.  This   is   a\r\n\r\nproposition  which everybody must accept. I  think  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  affected by resettlement appreciate  it.  They\r\n\r\nagree with the Government's development policy. If they\r\n\r\nget  reasonable compensation or allocation of land  and\r\n\r\nif  Government officers in implementing the policy  are\r\n\r\nreasonable  and fair, then they will not have  much  to\r\n\r\ncomplain  about.  But  sometimes, in  implementing  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government, some Government officials are\r\n\r\ntoo  rigid and inflexible. As a result, they are unable\r\n\r\nto  handle  a  situation without some  imagination  and\r\n\r\nflexibility.  Some farmers in the process  of  removing\r\n\r\nhave  to attend to their farming activities at the same\r\n\r\ntime,  and  they do not have the time to  change  their\r\n\r\naddresses at the police station because they are busily\r\n\r\nengaged.  As a result of resettlement, it is  sometimes\r\n\r\ndiscovered that the addresses in the identity cards  of\r\n\r\nsome farmers are different from those at which they are\r\n\r\nliving. Because of this, they are not allotted land  in\r\n\r\nthe  resettlement area. In some other cases, the houses\r\n\r\nof  the farmers are without house numbers. They use the\r\n\r\naddresses of some provision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshops in a market place and, because of this, they\r\n\r\ndo  not get farm land. In some other circumstances, the\r\n\r\nnames  of  farmers appearing in identity cards  do  not\r\n\r\ncompletely  tally  with their names appearing  in  some\r\n\r\nother Government documents. In cases where the transfer\r\n\r\nof   the   T.O.L. has  not  been  effected  from   the\r\n\r\ngrandfather  or the father to the farmer himself,  then\r\n\r\nthis person again will not be considered for allocation\r\n\r\nof farm land in the resettlement area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these people are, in fact, dependent upon farming\r\n\r\nactivities for their livelihood and they are not  given\r\n\r\nthe  necessary land. In certain circumstances, some  of\r\n\r\nthese  farmers have to live in Housing Board flats  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  change  their way  of  life  completely\r\n\r\nbecause   they  have  no  land  to  carry   out   their\r\n\r\nagricultural   activities,  and  they   are   cut   off\r\n\r\ncompletely  from  a  side  income.  So  they  find   it\r\n\r\ndifficult to make ends meet from their small income and\r\n\r\nthey  are faced with certain problems of earning  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one other aspect regarding\r\n\r\ncompensation.  In  my  constituency  there   are   some\r\n\r\nvillagers who have planted rubber trees on their  land.\r\n\r\nThe  Resettlement  Department assured  them  originally\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  get compensation  for  their  rubber\r\n\r\ntrees. This, in fact, was the position in 1963, so that\r\n\r\nowners  or  farmers who had planted  rubber  trees  got\r\n\r\ncompensation. This gave people the impression that,  in\r\n\r\nfuture, compensation would be given in other cases.  So\r\n\r\nthey  allowed  the Government to cut  down  the  rubber\r\n\r\ntrees.   But  later  on  they  were  notified  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to  their  astonishment,  that  Government\r\n\r\nwould not compensate them for cutting down their rubber\r\n\r\ntrees. They were taken by surprise. It was like a  bolt\r\n\r\nfrom the blue. They had engaged contractors to cut down\r\n\r\nthe   rubber   trees  in  the  hope  of  getting   some\r\n\r\ncompensation,  and  now they have no  compensation.  So\r\n\r\nthey   lose  the  trees  and  they  have  to  pay   the\r\n\r\ncontractors.  These  are  genuine  difficulties   which\r\n\r\ndeserve the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsympathetic consideration of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has just now mentioned,\r\n\r\namong  other things, the planning fees relating to  pig\r\n\r\nsties   and  chicken  runs.  I  myself  have   received\r\n\r\ncomplaints  on  this matter from my villagers,  because\r\n\r\ntheir income is already low enough. If they have to pay\r\n\r\nlicence fees from $3 or $5 to $12 a year, that will  be\r\n\r\na  burden to them, particularly as the chicken feed has\r\n\r\nincreased  in price and their farm produce,  such  as\r\n\r\neggs and chickens, has gone down in price. So they have\r\n\r\ndecreasing   prices for  their  farm  produce,   higher\r\n\r\nlicence  fees,  and more expensive chicken  feed.  They\r\n\r\ndeserve the sympathy of the Government, and I hope that\r\n\r\nthe Government or the Minister in charge will give them\r\n\r\ndue consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I had not intended to  enter  into  the\r\n\r\ndebate on the subject until my interest was aroused  by\r\n\r\ncertain  statements made by the Member for  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nand the Member for Choa Chu Kang, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the ordinary citizens of Singapore do not\r\n\r\nrealise   that  livestock  farming  is  a  considerable\r\n\r\neconomic  pursuit on this island, and  that,  far  from\r\n\r\nimporting  poultry, eggs and pork, this City  State  of\r\n\r\nours  is  a very substantial exporter of food  -  pigs,\r\n\r\neggs  and poultry - to surrounding countries. We  have reached  this  rather  unusual and surprising  position\r\n\r\nbecause  of  certain  advantages  which  we  enjoy   in\r\n\r\nlivestock  farming. Firstly, in the post-war  years  it\r\n\r\nwas   possible   to   control   diseases   and   pests,\r\n\r\nparticularly  among poultry, by injections,  especially\r\n\r\nanti-ranikhet injections. This enables large flocks  of\r\n\r\nbirds  to  be  raised  with small risk  of  substantial\r\n\r\nlosses  when  the whole flock dies during an  epidemic,\r\n\r\nwhich  used  to  happen regularly before  the  war.  In\r\n\r\naddition    to    this,   Singapore    has    excellent\r\n\r\ncommunications  and  could,  therefore,  buy   feeding\r\n\r\nstuffs like maize, fishmeal,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  cod  liver  oil from the cheapest markets  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Cheap supplies combined with excellent  banking\r\n\r\nand  credit facilities have enabled our farmers to  get\r\n\r\nfeeding stuffs on very favourable terms to enable  them\r\n\r\nto  raise large flocks of poultry either for the  table\r\n\r\nor  as  laying birds, as well as to raise large numbers\r\n\r\nof pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the economic point of view, there is one rather\r\n\r\nridiculous  feature  about the  livestock  industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This  is the absurdly low prices  at  which\r\n\r\nfarmers are able to rent or lease their land. A  farmer\r\n\r\ncan  get,  say,  5  or  10 acres  of  Crown  land  from\r\n\r\nGovernment on T.O.L. (Temporary Occupation Licence) for\r\n\r\na  fairly nominal payment of something like $5 or $2  a\r\n\r\nyear  sometimes.  Of course, this is not  the  economic\r\n\r\nrent.  It does not reflect the real value of land which\r\n\r\nthe  Government could get, say, from renting  the  land\r\n\r\nfor other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the cheapness of land which has somewhat\r\n\r\ndistorted  the  picture  and  has  not  impressed  upon\r\n\r\nfarmers  that land is very scarce. Supposing they  have\r\n\r\nto pay something like $200 a month for an acre of land,\r\n\r\nwhich  may be the market price for land, then  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  will  be more careful about the use of  land  and\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to raise very large flocks of  birds  or\r\n\r\nlarge numbers of pigs in small areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here we are. We are faced with a situation where\r\n\r\nland  is limited by nature and, at the same time, there\r\n\r\nis a substantial demand for the use of land for raising\r\n\r\npoultry and pigs because it is a paying occupation. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Bras Basah says that the solution would  be\r\n\r\nto  give  more  than  two acres  per  farmer  and  asks\r\n\r\nGovernment not to limit the grant of resettlement  land\r\n\r\nto  two acres. It is all very well to say, \"Let  us  be\r\n\r\ngenerous.\" But at whose expense? After all, the acreage\r\n\r\non  the island is limited and if you give more than two\r\n\r\nacres,  then  only a certain number of people  will  be\r\n\r\nable to get it and large numbers will have to be turned\r\n\r\naway  without  any land. So the idea of  giving  people\r\n\r\nlarger grants of land may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  all  right in individual cases, but I  think  as  a\r\n\r\npolicy it is self-defeating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to put forward for the consideration of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister one solution which was experimented  with\r\n\r\nin  the United Kingdom. I am not a farmer by profession\r\n\r\nor  a gentleman farmer; so I do not know at all whether\r\n\r\nit will work here, but maybe his staff can work out the\r\n\r\neconomics  and  the technical side of this  idea.  Some\r\n\r\nyears  ago  in  the  United  Kingdom  an  extraordinary\r\n\r\ndevelopment took place in agriculture, and that is  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of what are called \"concrete farms\".  Some\r\n\r\nfarmers  of  pigs - I think they were mainly  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  pigs -decided that you could raise pigs in flats!\r\n\r\nAfter  all, the rearing of a pig or for that  matter  a\r\n\r\nchicken,  is really a process whereby you put into  its\r\n\r\nmouth  corn  or  what have you, and  then  you  convert\r\n\r\nvegetable carbohydrates into animal protein.  And  that\r\n\r\nis what chickens and pigs are meant for! And you can do\r\n\r\nthis  in  a building. In fact, even in Singapore,  when\r\n\r\nthey  rear poultry by modern methods, they do  not  let\r\n\r\nthe poultry run about the farm; they put them in cages,\r\n\r\nand  pigs are kept in pig sties. [Interruption] No, no.\r\n\r\nNo  health  hazards, because then you can  arrange  for\r\n\r\nautomatic sprinklers and so on. You can put detergents,\r\n\r\nor  whatever  they are, at the right time  and  in  the\r\n\r\nright place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> You can then do farming in Housing\r\n\r\nBoard flats!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. I am not saying it could be\r\n\r\ndone  in  flats.  It could be done in  specially  built\r\n\r\nstructures. And since pigs and poultry are lighter than\r\n\r\nhuman beings, you can build a light and presumably less\r\n\r\ncostly structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Government must then give a\r\n\r\nspecial loan to the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, I am coming to that. When a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  enterprising farmers tried this in  Britain,\r\n\r\nthere  was,  of course, a tremendous uproar  among  the\r\n\r\nrespectable farmers who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreared  pigs  on  land.  They  said,  \"This  is  unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition.\"   Presumably  then  it   must   be   more\r\n\r\neconomical and more competitive to raise pigs  in  this\r\n\r\nunnatural way in concrete buildings than to raise  them\r\n\r\nin  the  natural way, i.e, on farm land.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister might get his officials to have a look at this\r\n\r\nidea.  And  if  it  is  possible to  build  very  cheap\r\n\r\nstructures,  much cheaper than, say, structures  needed\r\n\r\nfor  housing human beings, then this may be one way  of\r\n\r\nencouraging   the   growth  of  the  animal   husbandry\r\n\r\nindustry.  It  may mean, of course, Government  forking\r\n\r\nout  money. But, as against that, if it is possible  to\r\n\r\nsave  on land, then the saving in the cost of acquiring\r\n\r\nor buying land, the price of which will go up from year\r\n\r\nto  year,  can go into a fund which could be  used  for\r\n\r\nlending  money to farmers to enable them to build  this\r\n\r\nkind of structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Just before you proceed, Mr\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy, could I ask Members who are  now  turning\r\n\r\non   their   speakers  to  turn  them  off   when   Mr\r\n\r\nGovindaswamy finishes his speech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): When I speak on this\r\n\r\nmotion,  I  would like to refer to some  of  the  notes\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have made. Government has a bounden  duty  to\r\n\r\nwork  for  the welfare of the rural folk. Only  if  the\r\n\r\nrural  people have a fair livelihood will city dwellers\r\n\r\nhave  an  equally good livelihood. We put  up  so  many\r\n\r\nbuildings in the city area. We construct and widen  our\r\n\r\nroads.  Nevertheless, we must remember  from  where  we\r\n\r\nderive the foodstuffs for the city dwellers. Ours is  a\r\n\r\nvery  small country. We do not produce enough food  for\r\n\r\nour own consumption, but have to import it from abroad.\r\n\r\nWe have to use our land not only for the benefit of the\r\n\r\nrural dwellers, not only for better farming conditions,\r\n\r\nnot only for poultry and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndairy farming and pig rearing, but we have also to make\r\n\r\nthe  best  use of it. If such improvement projects  are\r\n\r\nundertaken,  then the produce will be of great  benefit\r\n\r\nto  all the people of this country. We will be able  to\r\n\r\nproduce enough to export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Defence has brought forward some facts. He says that poultry production has increased a great deal and that pig rearing has also increased, so we are able to export farm produce. From the Digest of Statistics of 1960, he will note how the cost of living has been rising. Since this is the case, and since only\r\n\r\ntwo acres of land are being allotted to the farmers  by\r\n\r\nGovernment, what can they do with two acres?  Can  they\r\n\r\nfarm  on it? Can they build anything to live on? If  we\r\n\r\ncannot provide such facilities for the farmers, then in\r\n\r\nwhat manner are we practising democratic socialism?  It\r\n\r\nis  only when we raise the living standard of the lower\r\n\r\nincome groups that we can have a secure future for  our\r\n\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Defence has also suggested that farming could be carried out in flatted buildings. Let us consider the tremendous amount of capital needed for such buildings. If the same capital could be provided for the farmers, it is easy to imagine the tremendous expansion in production which could be achieved. While\r\n\r\nwe  are  carrying out many improvement projects in  the\r\n\r\ncity,  we  should keep in mind the needs of  the  rural\r\n\r\ndwellers  as well. This Government has a duty  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  welfare  of  the  poorer  sections  of  our\r\n\r\ncommunity. It is these poorer sections who live in  the\r\n\r\nvillages.  Therefore, if the Government is not  showing\r\n\r\nsufficient interest in their problem, I feel it will be\r\n\r\nan  inadvisable  course.  The  rural  folks  are  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to help us. Their productivity means  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal for the city dwellers. In this connection, if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  indifferent, the people  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas may one day be compelled to leave their place and\r\n\r\ncome to the city to look for jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Labour has said, 69,500 people\r\n\r\nare  now unemployed and this figure may easily rise up.\r\n\r\nTo prevent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch a situation the Government has to devise ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  to  tackle the problem right now. It should,  as\r\n\r\nfar   as   possible,  assist  the  farmers   to   their\r\n\r\nsatisfaction. This is my submission to the  Government.\r\n\r\nMay I repeat again that we should not be indifferent in\r\n\r\nthis matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  today I am sitting in the Opposition's  place\r\n\r\nand  so I shall stand up and say what is right and what\r\n\r\nis wrong without any favour, fear or ill-will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Bras Basah has made an\r\n\r\nadjournment  speech  on  the resettlement  of  farmers.\r\n\r\nFormerly I was an official in the Resettlement  Section\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  and  I know  more  than  he  does.\r\n\r\nResettlement is within the jurisdiction of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development. There are merits and demerits\r\n\r\nin  the work done by the Primary Production Department.\r\n\r\nWhat are the merits? The merits are that the Government\r\n\r\nis  looking after the housing needs of the people.  The\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board has undertaken a massive\r\n\r\nhousing  programme.  But in other  respects  there  are\r\n\r\ndefects.  What  are  the defects and  demerits  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  concerned? Although I am  in  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nseat, I will say what is right and what is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of resettlement of farmers, there was no\r\n\r\ncompensation  paid in the beginning. In some  cases  no\r\n\r\nalternative accommodation was allotted. In  some  cases\r\n\r\nfarmers  received  $500 or $1,000 as  compensation  for\r\n\r\nresettlement,    but    they   had    no    alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation. This is a defect. Later on the situation\r\n\r\nwas improved. The farmers got alternative accommodation\r\n\r\nplus  compensation. Still later on they got  two  acres\r\n\r\nfor  farming. This is, of course, right. But  now  they\r\n\r\nsay they do not have enough farming land. If you do not\r\n\r\ngive  them the land, how could you expect them to live?\r\n\r\nThis  is  the defect or the demerit, as I have  already\r\n\r\nsaid.

The most important  thing  is  the\r\n\r\nadministrative   work.  The  officer   in   charge   of\r\n\r\nadministration should not do things as he pleases.  The\r\n\r\nfailure  in  certain respects is not the fault  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  or  the Parliamentary Secretary.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nfault  of  the administrative head, because he  took  a\r\n\r\ndictatorial course of action. He was stubborn  in  some\r\n\r\ncases.  He took action without consulting the  Minister\r\n\r\nin  charge. He went his own way. Sometimes, of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister was to be blamed because he did not  seem\r\n\r\nto  know  many  things. Yes, it is true.

As  in  the  past,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has acquired a lot of land for reallocation\r\n\r\nto farmers.

The first is that the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  reconsider  its  policy  towards  the  farmers.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  the  Minister or the  department  concerned,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the  Resettlement Section,  must  set  up  a\r\n\r\ncommittee   comprising,  in  particular,   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  for the rural areas and constituencies  and\r\n\r\nofficers  of  the department concerned. This  committee\r\n\r\nwill  be in charge of resettlement as a whole. Thirdly,\r\n\r\na  policy must be formulated to assist the farmers on a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive basis so that they will not suffer  great\r\n\r\nhardships and will be given an opportunity to carry  on\r\n\r\ntheir farming activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the resettlement\r\n\r\nof  farmers does not affect my constituency, but  since\r\n\r\nit  is  in  the rural area, I would like to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  say  a  few words.  Firstly,  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport the views expressed by the mover of the motion\r\n\r\nand  several  of  my colleagues on the resettlement  of\r\n\r\nfarmers  occupying State land. Sir, the Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen  stressing  a great deal on the need  to  increase\r\n\r\nproductivity,  but productivity in this  context  means\r\n\r\nincreasing  industrial produce  only.  However,  in  my\r\n\r\nview,  the Government has not made a realistic approach\r\n\r\ntowards encouraging our farmers to increase the  output\r\n\r\nof  agricultural produce. From what I gather in  regard\r\n\r\nto  the resettlement of farmers, the Government has, in\r\n\r\nfact,  allotted  them farm land which is  much  smaller\r\n\r\nthan the farm land on which they had previously farmed.\r\n\r\nFor example, when a farming area is to be taken over by\r\n\r\nthe Government for public development, the resettlement\r\n\r\nof  farmers will inevitably take place, but instead  of\r\n\r\nallocating them farm land of a similar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsize,  the Government, through the department concerned\r\n\r\nor  the  statutory board, has allocated to  them  small\r\n\r\nplots of land, thereby reducing their scope to increase\r\n\r\ntheir farming activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure this House will agree with me on this\r\n\r\npoint. When an area is required for public development,\r\n\r\nand  resettlement of farmers takes place,  the  farmers\r\n\r\nwill  have to be moved out to new areas. They will have\r\n\r\nto  start all over again before they can carry on  with\r\n\r\ntheir  normal  activities and to  reap  their  harvest.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  with  the reduction in the  size  of  their\r\n\r\nfarming  lands,  they  will  inevitably  reduce   their\r\n\r\nfarming  activities,  thereby resulting  in  a  reduced\r\n\r\namount  of agricultural produce. Sir, I am sure  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  the Government's intention to inhibit the progress\r\n\r\nof  farming  activities  in  our  Republic.  Therefore,\r\n\r\ninstead of decreasing the size of resettled land to  be\r\n\r\nallocated, which is not more than two acres,  I  appeal\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister  concerned to take a  more  realistic\r\n\r\npolicy  on the resettlement of the farmers. I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthis  House  will  bear with me if I  stress  that  the\r\n\r\nfarmers in the Republic play an important role  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry's struggle for survival. They toil all  day  to\r\n\r\nproduce  as  much agricultural produce as  possible  to\r\n\r\nhelp  feed  many  of  our people.  They  produce  large\r\n\r\nquantities of eggs, poultry, pigs and a good variety of\r\n\r\nvegetables.  By so doing, they contribute in  no  small\r\n\r\nmeasure  towards providing these essential  commodities\r\n\r\nfor a good part of our population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, realising the importance of the role\r\n\r\nplayed by the farmers, I would like to appeal again  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Law and National Development to  look\r\n\r\nclosely   into  this  question  of  resettling  farmers\r\n\r\noccupying State land with a view to increasing the size\r\n\r\nof land to be allocated, instead of reducing such plots\r\n\r\nto  not  more than two acres, so that the farmers  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  help feed a good many of us not  only  in\r\n\r\nthis House but in our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, several\r\n\r\nMembers   of   this  House  have  spoken   about   the\r\n\r\nresettlement  of farmers. I sincerely  hope  that  the\r\n\r\ndepartment concerned, including\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister in charge, and the officials will in  due\r\n\r\ncourse  treat  this problem with some humility  and  in\r\n\r\nproper  perspective. I would like  to  suggest  that  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  be set up to review our farming  policy  and\r\n\r\nits  terms of reference must include the administration\r\n\r\nof  the  Resettlement Department.  And  if  the  review\r\n\r\nreveals   that  there  are  certain  defects   in   the\r\n\r\ndepartment  concerned,  then  the  department  requires\r\n\r\n\"resettlement\" itself!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two other points to add. In the Resettlement\r\n\r\nSection,  problems have arisen in various  fields.  For\r\n\r\nquite  some  time  in  the  past,  the  rules  of   the\r\n\r\nResettlement  Section were such that those  people  who\r\n\r\nwere  ignorant  of  the  rules were  always  told  that\r\n\r\neverything was done according to law. But, in  fact,  a\r\n\r\nlot of things were not done according to law. They were\r\n\r\ndone  according  to the rules. They were  not  actually\r\n\r\nlaws which had been passed and debated in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring to the attention of\r\n\r\nMembers  concerns the \"masterpiece\" of the Resettlement\r\n\r\nSection.  Some farmers are quite prepared to  make  way\r\n\r\nfor   the  development  of  their  farm  land  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and to resettle in another place. But  if  a\r\n\r\nvillager  affected is a sole occupier, then he  is  not\r\n\r\nentitled  to  alternative accommodation  in  a  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flat. Even if he has a child - a daughter  or  a\r\n\r\nson  who  applies jointly with him for a Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflat, his application will be turned down on the ground\r\n\r\nthat his child -- daughter or son - is not affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  resettlement scheme, having been living in another\r\n\r\nplace. This is ridiculous. This is a blunder - a  legal\r\n\r\nblunder  if we may call it - because the sole  occupier\r\n\r\naffected is allowed to apply jointly with another  sole\r\n\r\noccupier  affected  by the same scheme  for  a  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flat. If a bachelor and a spinster are similarly\r\n\r\naffected,  how  can they be expected to  make  a  joint\r\n\r\napplication for a Housing Board flat? This is a  defect\r\n\r\nwhich  must be removed. This is a common sense  matter.\r\n\r\nWhen a sole occupier is affected, he being lonely is in\r\n\r\nmisery already. And if he is to be discriminated in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfavour  of  those with families, those  who  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbliss  of  family life, then he should receive  special\r\n\r\nconsideration to compensate him. This is a policy which\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should consider. The present  rule  is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  common sense concept of  humanitarianism.\r\n\r\nAlthough sole occupiers are not many in number, I  hope\r\n\r\nwe  are able to handle their problems with some ease so\r\n\r\nthat  they will be housed in a proper place. This is  a\r\n\r\nmatter worthy of our consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that in the Resettlement Section\r\n\r\nsome  work  is done with no bearing on resettlement  at\r\n\r\nall.  This  is  the  matter of eviction.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nresettlement.  There is eviction without  resettlement.\r\n\r\nIf  you want to resettle, that means after eviction you\r\n\r\nmust rehouse the evicted people somewhere else. But  in\r\n\r\nmany cases the so-called resettlement is mere eviction.\r\n\r\nThe  people are driven out and that is the end  of  it.\r\n\r\nThat  is  what  they call resettlement, which  I  would\r\n\r\nrather  call eviction. The officers concerned must  not\r\n\r\nforget  that  the department is set up for resettlement\r\n\r\nand  not  for eviction alone. So they must  know  their\r\n\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say we regret that in certain places some\r\n\r\ntemples are in existence. Because they are affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  resettlement scheme, they have to be removed.  But\r\n\r\nthe administrative policy does not give resettlement to\r\n\r\nthe  people  living  in these temples.  They  are  just\r\n\r\nevicted  and are given no alternative land,  either  to\r\n\r\nbuild  another temple, or accommodation to live in  and\r\n\r\nto  carry out their religious activities. As a  result,\r\n\r\nthese people have no place for religious congregations.\r\n\r\nThis  is  against the freedom of religion advocated  in\r\n\r\nour  Republic. It is inconsistent with the  concept  of\r\n\r\nfreedom  of religion. So certain arrangements  must  be\r\n\r\nmade  in  regard to temples and other places of worship\r\n\r\naffected  by the resettlement scheme. This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nsensitive  matter  and  must  be  given  some   careful\r\n\r\nthought. In the case of a mosque or church affected  by\r\n\r\na  resettlement  scheme, alternative  accommodation  or\r\n\r\nland  is given for the reconstruction of the mosque  or\r\n\r\nthe church. But in the case of temples of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother  religion, no provision is made in some  cases.\r\n\r\nThis  will give rise to discontent and misunderstanding\r\n\r\namongst the members of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like the Minister in charge and the\r\n\r\nofficers  concerned to pay special  attention  to  this\r\n\r\naspect  of  the problem, because we have received  many\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from  the farmers and villagers  about  the\r\n\r\nofficers of the Resettlement Section. Perhaps  not  all\r\n\r\nof  them are bad in their attitude in dealing with  the\r\n\r\npublic,  but some of them are lacking in the spirit  of\r\n\r\npublic service. When they carry out their duties, there\r\n\r\nis  no  sincerity  on their faces. Instead,  they  look\r\n\r\nfierce   when  they  implement  the  policies  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. When you go to the Resettlement Section, it\r\n\r\nlooks  as  though you are going to hell  with  all  the\r\n\r\ndevilish-looking officers around. Sir, some farmers who\r\n\r\nneed to go to the Resettlement Section invariably go to\r\n\r\ntheir   Members   of  Parliament  for   a   letter   of\r\n\r\nrecommendation,  as though it is an effective  talisman\r\n\r\nagainst  these devilish-looking officers! Some  farmers\r\n\r\nand  villagers complain that the letters given to  them\r\n\r\nhave been torn to pieces by the officers concerned.  So\r\n\r\nI hope the Minister concerned will look into the matter\r\n\r\nand  take  stringent  action  against  these  officers,\r\n\r\nbecause  in our newly-independent Republic, if we  want\r\n\r\nthe people to support us in national reconstruction, we\r\n\r\nmust  not  allow  a small group of public  servants  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  sense  of  hatred among the  public  against\r\n\r\nGovernment. This is my sincere hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard\r\n\r\npractically  all the Members of this House  speak  with\r\n\r\none  voice,  except the Minister of Defence,  and  they\r\n\r\nmake   general  allegations  against  the  Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment of the Housing and Development Board. I,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  have no answers to the general allegations.  I\r\n\r\nremember,  in  particular, the Member for  Bukit  Merah\r\n\r\nshouting   about   the  devils  in   the   Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment. I would suggest that he give me  the  names\r\n\r\nof these devils and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  the  allegations  are,  because  anyone  who   is\r\n\r\nresettled  is  dissatisfied. You give  him  a  thousand\r\n\r\ndollars;  he wants two thousand dollars. You  give  him\r\n\r\none acre; he wants five acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the hon. Members themselves have\r\n\r\nadmitted,  land is a scarce commodity in Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  land  is  very scarce. We have only  225  square\r\n\r\nmiles  of  land in Singapore. We are trying to  reclaim\r\n\r\nmore land. We have a reclamation scheme in Kallang.  We\r\n\r\nare  reclaiming  land in Kranji, along the  East  Coast\r\n\r\nRoad and in the Port Authority. But all the reclamation\r\n\r\nwe  do  in  Singapore cannot double  the  size  of  the\r\n\r\nisland,  and  a great part of the land in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nswampy land. A large part, too, forms part of the  land\r\n\r\nadjacent to our reservoirs and we cannot allow  farmers\r\n\r\nin.  This is the catchment area and it is a wide  area.\r\n\r\nIf  yon allow them in with their pigs and chickens, the\r\n\r\nwater will be polluted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> You are driving a motor road in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> To drive in a motor road is a different\r\n\r\nthing. You have a road along MacRitchie Reservoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in short, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not got\r\n\r\nsufficient  land.  Everybody in Singapore  expects  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to give all the time; they themselves  never\r\n\r\ngive.  In  Singapore,  we  have  large  acres  of  land\r\n\r\noccupied  by,  say,  one  person.  A  few  years   ago,\r\n\r\ninvestigations revealed that, a woman in Singapore  had\r\n\r\na  Temporary Occupation Licence from the Government and\r\n\r\nshe  was  occupying 300 acres of State  land.  She  was\r\n\r\nsupposed to be in occupation, but all she was doing was\r\n\r\nmaking money out of that. All 300 acres were sublet  to\r\n\r\nothers  who  were paying her fees or rent.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthese   300   acres  were  taken  away.  Her  Temporary\r\n\r\nOccupation Licence was revoked and licences were  given\r\n\r\nto  the  actual occupants. This is our policy. We  give\r\n\r\nland to people who want land and who occupy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about the Singapore Island Club\r\n\r\nwhere they play golf?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> But this is just one example. If you have\r\n\r\nany  noises to make about the Golf Club, do not address\r\n\r\nthem to me. I am not a golfer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to our subject. If we have in Singapore\r\n\r\nland  as much as the Malaysians have in Johore  or  the\r\n\r\nAustralians in Australia or the New Zealanders  in  New\r\n\r\nZealand, I would he happy to comply with their  wishes.\r\n\r\nInstead of giving them two acres, I would give them two\r\n\r\nsquare miles. But we have not got the land. That is why\r\n\r\nour  buildings  go  up  and up.  We  are  not  building\r\n\r\nsideways;  we are going up. As the Minister of  Defence\r\n\r\nhas  pointed  out,  it would not be realistic  to  give\r\n\r\nfarmers  more  than two acres of land. I  realise  that\r\n\r\nproduction  will  not be as great as if  a  farmer  had\r\n\r\nthree  acres or twenty acres. That is logical.  But  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Choa Chu Kang puts it, it is a question\r\n\r\nof  priority - land for industry, land for farms.  Do  we\r\n\r\nsacrifice everything for the farmers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another wrong impression Members have is that all\r\n\r\nfarmers  are poor. They say, \"Why do you not  help  the\r\n\r\nrural  folk? You are doing nothing for the rural  folk.\r\n\r\nThey  are  all poor.\" But the Member for Choa Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nhas  quoted one case in his constituency where  someone\r\n\r\nwas  occupying  ten acres of Government  land  and  the\r\n\r\nturnover  was $1 million a year. This person said  that\r\n\r\nwe  took away this land and gave him two acres. I  say,\r\n\r\nwhat is wrong with that? The land never belonged to him;\r\n\r\nthe  land  belonged to us. It was not to cut  down  his\r\n\r\nproduction.  If  he had so much money,  he  could  have\r\n\r\nbought  10, 20 or 30 acres. But as I have put  it  just\r\n\r\nnow,  they all want to take; they never give. What  has\r\n\r\nthe  Government to give? The Government  has  land.  So\r\n\r\neverybody  gets  T.O.L.s.  Once  the  T.O.L. is  given\r\n\r\n- whether  it is for 10, 15 or 20 acres -they behave  as\r\n\r\nif  the  land  is  theirs. Now this is where  they  are\r\n\r\nwrong.  The land is State land and it is let  out  very\r\n\r\ncheaply  -$15  per annum for one acre,  which  is  well\r\n\r\nbelow the economic rent. It is practically a gift  -  a\r\n\r\ngift  on  a  year's licence. But the land  is  not  the\r\n\r\nfarmers'.  The land is State land. Subject  to  certain\r\n\r\nconditions, that licence is given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand one of the conditions is no transfer, no subletting\r\n\r\nwithout the consent of the Commissioner of Lands, which\r\n\r\nmakes  me  come  to  the second  point  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nLivestock Association in their letter to the Member for\r\n\r\nBras Basah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We give Mr X two acres of land. He claims to be a\r\n\r\ngenuine  farmer. We go into his bona fides and  we  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied that he is a farmer. We give him two acres of\r\n\r\nland.  What  does he do? He transfers  his  two  acres,\r\n\r\neither  through non-interest in farming or because  his\r\n\r\nfarming did not succeed, to a successful farmer. So the\r\n\r\nLand Office hears about this and says to him, \"You have\r\n\r\nno  business to transfer without telling us. One of the\r\n\r\nconditions  is that you should not transfer.\"  So  they\r\n\r\nimpose  a  premium which is in the region of  $150  per\r\n\r\nacre. They also increase the rent. The previous licence\r\n\r\n-  or rent if you like to call it was a subsidised fee.\r\n\r\nWe  were  not making any money out of it.  But  when  a\r\n\r\ntransfer  like that takes place, we charge an  economic\r\n\r\nrent or a licence fee. The reason is this -- - that the\r\n\r\nland  is  our  land.  Because  of  the  transfer,   the\r\n\r\ntransferor  gets a few thousand dollars. Do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat  out  of  the goodness of his heart he transferred\r\n\r\nhis  licence  fee.  He  got a  big  fat  fee  for  that\r\n\r\ntransfer.  Normally in order to avoid stamp duty,  they\r\n\r\ndeclare  the  transfer fee at $4,000 in  order  not  to\r\n\r\navoid  but to reduce the amount of stamp fee attracted.\r\n\r\nSo  this  is  Government land let out on a  T.O.L. and\r\n\r\nsomeone  practically sells it. They sell our  land.  We\r\n\r\nshould  be  making the profit, but they are making  the\r\n\r\nprofit. If we do not either revoke the T.O.L. or impose\r\n\r\nthese  new transfer fees and increases in annual  fees,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  buying  and  selling  State  land  like\r\n\r\nnobody's  business. This is the mistake.  The  land  is\r\n\r\nours;  it  is  not  theirs. We let it  out  on  certain\r\n\r\nconditions  provided they keep to the conditions.  They\r\n\r\nwill always have the land, but the trouble is that they\r\n\r\ndo not keep to the conditions. That is the second point\r\n\r\nraised by the Member for Bras Basah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Livestock Association.\r\n\r\nWe  come  now to the building permits which  have  been\r\n\r\nraised to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$12  per  annum. There is a history behind  this,  and,\r\n\r\nshortly,  it is this. A new set of building regulations\r\n\r\ncame into effect from the 1st of August, 1966, the  aim\r\n\r\nbeing  to  replace two sets of former building  by-laws\r\n\r\nwhich  consisted of City Council by-laws applicable  to\r\n\r\nthe city area and those of the Rural Board bylaws which\r\n\r\nwere applicable to areas outside the city. In doing so,\r\n\r\nthis   simplified  administrative  procedure   overcame\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies  experienced in the past because  of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  sets  of building by-laws. The fee for a temporary\r\n\r\npermit for any temporary building in the city area  was\r\n\r\n$12  per annum. This fee was not increased but was made\r\n\r\napplicable  to  the whole of Singapore island,  and  it\r\n\r\naffected the Rural Board so that a temporary permit fee\r\n\r\nof $3 to $5 per annum in the past was increased to $12.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Finance had a hand in this. His scale\r\n\r\nof  fees in the rural areas had not been revised  since\r\n\r\n1953 and he felt that it was fair and reasonable that a\r\n\r\nfee of $12 per annum charged for a temporary permit  in\r\n\r\nthe  city  area should be made applicable in the  rural\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to come back again to the subject of \"We are\r\n\r\ndoing  nothing for the farmers;\" \"you must have  a  new\r\n\r\npolicy in farming;\" \"the Minister does not know what is\r\n\r\nhappening  in his Resettlement Department,  people  are\r\n\r\ngrumbling.\"  Let  me  tell  you  this.  In   1965,   we\r\n\r\nintroduced  legislation to register all  farmers.  This\r\n\r\nincidentally was done by way of the Animals  and  Birds\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Ordinance. The object of this  legislation\r\n\r\nwas  to  register the farmers. The idea of  registering\r\n\r\nthem  was to find out how many farmers we had and  what\r\n\r\ntype of farmers we had. The intention was to try to see\r\n\r\nthe  size of the problem and, if possible, to make sure\r\n\r\nthat  the,  services provided by the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment should benefit those people who needed these\r\n\r\nexpansion   services   most.  The  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  was  of  the  view  that  registration  was\r\n\r\nessential.  For some reason or other, this registration\r\n\r\nof  farmers met with considerable opposition  from  the\r\n\r\nfarming population, perhaps more through ignorance  but\r\n\r\nperhaps they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad their valid reasons. To cover administrative costs,\r\n\r\nwe  intended  to  charge them $5 registration  fee  per\r\n\r\nfarmer.  They  did  not  like  it.  Another  reason  is\r\n\r\nprobably  this. They do not pay income tax. The  moment\r\n\r\nthey register, the Minister for Finance chases them. So\r\n\r\nwe  give away money when we do not know who the farmers\r\n\r\nare.  But  that $5 is incidental. We are  not  charging\r\n\r\nthem annually. It was just this once. They did not like\r\n\r\nthe  idea. They did not like us to know more about them\r\n\r\nthan what they told us. If they have their problems, we\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to help them. But how can you  help  any\r\n\r\nbody  of  people unless you know who these people  are,\r\n\r\nhow  many  there are, and what their problems are?  One\r\n\r\nmethod is registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Why not take a census?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> And in registration you can distinguish\r\n\r\nbetween the genuine farmer and the bogus farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Members has pointed out that we give land\r\n\r\nto one farmer and the next month he transfers it; so we\r\n\r\nare  at fault. He says, \"Sometimes you do not give land\r\n\r\nto  a genuine farmer,\" and so we are at fault. When you\r\n\r\ngive,  it is wrong. When you do not give, it is  wrong.\r\n\r\nWhen  you  query  him about his identity  card,  it  is\r\n\r\nwrong. The address is in Changi, but he is supposed  to\r\n\r\nbe farming in Choa Chu Kang. So we look at his identity\r\n\r\ncard and ask, \"What is this?\" Oh, he does not like  it;\r\n\r\nhe  is a genuine farmer. Or his name is different,  and\r\n\r\nwe  query. And when we query, he does not like it.  But\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of querying is merely to find ample evidence\r\n\r\nor  proof that they are genuine farmers.

I am not saying  that\r\n\r\nthe whole lot are crooks, but we must catch the crooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> This could be due to a change of\r\n\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It could be; very rightly so. But we\r\n\r\nquery  not  to down them. We query to down the  crooks.\r\n\r\nBut there must be grouses on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I could now refer to the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nwho is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere.  I  think he has made a very valuable  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  we  start farming on the outer islands.  We  have\r\n\r\nabout 40 islands round Singapore, and I can assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  an  intensive survey has been made by a committee\r\n\r\nwho has done a lot of field work on the islands, and it\r\n\r\nhas made certain recommendations. Land is scarce and we\r\n\r\nneed  more land and we propose to use these islands.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  give  details at the moment as  the  report  is\r\n\r\nstill  quite secret, but I can assure him that  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to make use of these islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> For farming or for pleasure?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> For all purposes. But it is difficult to\r\n\r\nget  the farmers to leave the main island for the small\r\n\r\nislands. That is the point, they will not move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has made one point which,\r\n\r\nI  think,  I must reply to, and that is this.  He  says\r\n\r\nthat when a church or a mosque is demolished, there  is\r\n\r\nalways  another  piece of land for  another  church  or\r\n\r\nanother  mosque.  When  it is a  temple,  he  says,  we\r\n\r\ndemolish the temple and never supply the land.  Let  me\r\n\r\nreassure him that we have a multi-religious policy  and\r\n\r\nwe  do not discriminate between churches, mosques,  and\r\n\r\ntemples.  It  is not easy to find alternative  land  in\r\n\r\nHousing  Board estates where a temple wants to be,  and\r\n\r\neach particular problem or temple must be dealt with on\r\n\r\nthe  facts of the case. I think the Member will realise\r\n\r\nthat  religion is a very sensitive problem, and  people\r\n\r\nare  very  touchy. I would be the last  person  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  to break into a temple and pull the walls  down.\r\n\r\nAll  these  matters have to be handled with the  utmost\r\n\r\ntact,  and  we  do  our best not to be  forced  into  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  demolish. In fact, we never demolish.  We\r\n\r\nbehave,  I should say, with a lot of sincerity  and  we\r\n\r\nfinally  after  a long time get them to move,  but  not\r\n\r\nafter they have extracted from us many a concession!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Member has referred to the question of rubber\r\n\r\ntrees.  He  says  that the Government promised  to  pay\r\n\r\ncompensation for cutting down rubber trees,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  then this poor farmer engaged a contractor to  cut\r\n\r\ndown  the rubber trees. And when the rubber trees  were\r\n\r\ncut  down, no compensation was paid. We have, in  fact,\r\n\r\npaid compensation for rubber trees in some cases and we\r\n\r\nhave  refused  to  pay in others. I do  not  know  what\r\n\r\nparticular  case he has in mind, but where a  Temporary\r\n\r\nOccupation Licence has a condition that you are to farm\r\n\r\non  the  land  and not to plant rubber trees,  you  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  farm  on the land. If  you  plant  rubber\r\n\r\ntrees, and we find that out later, then we cut down the\r\n\r\ntrees,  because you have already broken the  conditions\r\n\r\nof  the Temporary Occupation Licence. You are lucky  we\r\n\r\ndid   not  revoke  the  licence.  Do  not  expect   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to pay you for planting rubber trees,  which\r\n\r\nis  in direct breach of one of the express terms of the\r\n\r\nTemporary  Occupation Licence. But if  we  give  you  a\r\n\r\nT.O.L. to plant rubber trees, we will pay you when  we\r\n\r\ncut  down  the  rubber trees, but  not  otherwise.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Changi  should  know  that  some  of   the\r\n\r\nTemporary Occupation Licences were granted long  before\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. came to power, even before the last war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I close, Mr Speaker, I should tell Members of\r\n\r\nthe  House about the present resettlement policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  it  is  this.  Farmers  - Category  A.\r\n\r\nGenuine  farmers are provided with alternative land  in\r\n\r\ndeveloped resettlement areas plus cash compensation for\r\n\r\ntheir  houses,  improvements and cultivation.  If  they\r\n\r\nelect to find their own accommodation, they are paid  a\r\n\r\nrehabilitation grant of $1,000 per acre  of  cultivated\r\n\r\nland.  Transport allowance ranging from $50 for a  sub-tenant to $100 for a hut owner is paid, irrespective of\r\n\r\nwhether  they are resettled in a resettlement  area  or\r\n\r\nelect to find their own accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category B - non-farmers. Non-farmers are given\r\n\r\nsuitable  alternative accommodation  in  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats,  if  they  want  such  flats,  plus  payment  of\r\n\r\ndisturbance and transport allowance ranging  from  $300\r\n\r\nfor  a  sub-tenant to $350 for a hut owner or occupier.\r\n\r\nThe hut owner will be reimbursed for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouse  occupied by his immediate family and  for  other\r\n\r\nimprovements  in  accordance  with  the   schedule   of\r\n\r\napproved  rates.  These benefits are also  extended  to\r\n\r\nfamilies who elect to find their own accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopkeepers - Category C - affected by clearance are\r\n\r\ngiven  priority in the allocation of alternative  shops\r\n\r\nin  various  Housing and Development Board  estates  at\r\n\r\nconcessional rentals without having to go  through  the\r\n\r\nnormal tender system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps before I close, it would not be out of order\r\n\r\nfor me to give you -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> A bouquet!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Not a bouquet, but to give you the\r\n\r\nfigures  of  the amount of money paid by the Government\r\n\r\nfrom  1961  to 1966. In 1961 we paid about $275,000  as\r\n\r\ncompensation;  1962  $924,000;  1963  $1,698,000;  1964\r\n\r\n$3,365,000;  1965  $5,451,000; and  for  the  first  10\r\n\r\nmonths of this year, we have already paid more than  $4\r\n\r\nmillion in compensation. So we have spent quite  a  bit\r\n\r\nof money in respect of resettlement. We have not forced\r\n\r\nany  person  out  of his house without proper  care  or\r\n\r\nreasonable compensation. It is accepted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat to get a family to move out from a place where the\r\n\r\nmembers  have  lived for many years  is  not  a  simple\r\n\r\noperation.  The Government has, therefore,  made  it  a\r\n\r\npolicy  not  to  upset  such  families  unless  it   is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  necessary, as in the  case  of  land  being\r\n\r\nrequired  for a public purpose, for road widening,  for\r\n\r\nreclamation, for a school, for a clinic, or for  public\r\n\r\nhousing.  Even  then  it  must be  explained,  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of those who pretend to be so indignant,  that\r\n\r\nan  infinite amount of patience, tolerance and sympathy\r\n\r\nhas  always  been  exercised to  make  resettlement  as\r\n\r\npainless  as possible. We would be happier if it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  necessary to upset or uproot any family,  but,\r\n\r\nhon.   Gentlemen,  the  alternative  is  to   have   no\r\n\r\ndevelopment, no roads, no new schools, no clinics,  and\r\n\r\nno housing. Surely this is not what you critics want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Thirteen minutes past Seven o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Wednesday, 14th December, 1966.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
