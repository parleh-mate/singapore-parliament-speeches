I was telling the House  how\r\n\r\nhe  even  said that if he had only stood his  ground\r\n\r\nfor  another 24 or 48 hours he would have got Duncan\r\n\r\nSandys  down  on his bended knees before  the  great\r\n\r\nanti-colonial P.A.P. hero. But the letter  from  Mr\r\n\r\nDuncan  Sandys clearly states the position.  Blakang\r\n\r\nMati  with its 658 acres will not be released  until\r\n\r\n1966 and the Sembawang land will not be released  at\r\n\r\nall. Even Fort Canning will be released only if  and\r\n\r\nwhen  - these are very important words, Sir, \"if  and\r\n\r\nwhen\"  - the  British do not want it and  only  after\r\n\r\nadequate   compensation  from  the   Government   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  has been paid. The Prime Minister  claims\r\n\r\nhe has obtained from the U.K. Government $10 million\r\n\r\nas payment for illegal occupation of Singapore land.\r\n\r\nBut  let us be very clear what the money is for.  It\r\n\r\nis not for rent or compensation of the land occupied\r\n\r\nby  the military forces. Any rent payable is only  a\r\n\r\nnominal sum of $1 per site. The Singapore Government\r\n\r\nunder the P.A.P. can be extraordinarily generous  to\r\n\r\nthe colonial Government - their colonial masters - but\r\n\r\nnot  to the people. And only licence money collected\r\n\r\nfrom farmers cultivating land now illegally occupied\r\n\r\nby  the British military forces will be made payable\r\n\r\nto  the  Singapore  Government.  That  amount,  Sir,\r\n\r\ncannot  amount  to very much. The $10 million  which\r\n\r\nthe U.K. Government will make available to Singapore\r\n\r\nis   only   meant   \"for  raising,   equipping   and\r\n\r\naccommodating the Second Battalion of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nInfantry  Regiment  up to 31st  August,  1963,  when\r\n\r\nSingapore's   financial   responsibility    ceases.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, we hear right from the horse's mouth that\r\n\r\nthe money is only for raising\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Second Battalion, which we all know  is  to  be\r\n\r\nused  by the colonial Government for the suppression\r\n\r\nof  the  hopes and aspirations of the people in  the\r\n\r\nregion. P.A.P. propaganda has created the impression\r\n\r\nthat  the money is payment for compensation of  land\r\n\r\nnow  occupied  by the British military  forces.  But\r\n\r\nthis  is not so. The Prime Minister may say anything\r\n\r\nin his own letter to Mr Duncan Sandys, but the fact\r\n\r\nremains  that  the  $10 million given  by  the  U.K.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  given only for the  raising  of  the\r\n\r\nmilitary forces. We hope the P.A.P. Government  will\r\n\r\nhave  enough guts to tell the people all this.  Tell\r\n\r\nthem  the  truth. Do not hide. Anyway, however  much\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. may want to hide, we will expose them. It\r\n\r\nis  time  that the P.A.P. realise that  they  cannot\r\n\r\ndeceive the people all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, we may ask, if the military forces\r\n\r\nreally are in illegal occupation of Singapore  land,\r\n\r\nwhy does the P.A.P. not use its police and courts to\r\n\r\nevict  the British forces from occupation? The brave\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has done this often enough but only  against\r\n\r\npoor,  defence-less men and women who  cannot  fight\r\n\r\nback  against the police and the troops.  Would  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. dare  to  take  action against  the  British\r\n\r\nforces?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the matter of the loan of $150 million for\r\n\r\nthe development of the Borneo territories, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  tries a face-saving device by asking  that\r\n\r\n50  per  cent of the labourers who will be used  for\r\n\r\nsuch  development should be supplied from Singapore.\r\n\r\nHe  claims that these terms are written on the  back\r\n\r\nof an envelope and allegedly signed by the Tunku. He\r\n\r\nclaims  that  50 per cent of labour, including  even\r\n\r\ncontractors, must come from Singapore in the use  of\r\n\r\nthe  $150  million  loan. Here  we  see  the  absurd\r\n\r\nposition  of the P.A.P. On the one hand,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said that he had \"insisted\" that  the  so-called  common  market terms  be  written  into  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  and that nothing else  would  be  good\r\n\r\nenough.  He  repeatedly said during his constituency\r\n\r\ntours that the M.C.A. in the Federation is trying to\r\n\r\nsoak  the  people of Singapore and that, because  of\r\n\r\nthat, the common market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrangement  must be written into the  Constitution.\r\n\r\nYet, on the other hand, the Prime Minister tells  us\r\n\r\nthat  something scribbled, rather illegibly at that,\r\n\r\non  the back of an envelope is as good a bond in the\r\n\r\nconduct of affairs of State. Is this not evidence of\r\n\r\nthe Gilbert and Sullivan cuckoo-land of Lee Kuan Yew\r\n\r\nand his Ministers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is today published in the Nanyang Siang\r\n\r\nPau   a  letter  with  the  scribbled  envelope   in\r\n\r\nphotostat  for all to see. We can see  a  few  words\r\n\r\nscribbled and clown below some more scribbling  with\r\n\r\nbig  crosses all over the place. In a statement,  it\r\n\r\nsays  that the Tunku's signature on the back of that\r\n\r\nenvelope  means  only acceptance of the  points  for\r\n\r\ndiscussion  and that the envelope cannot be  treated\r\n\r\nas  an official document. They even complained  that\r\n\r\nthe  action  of the Prime Minister of  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nraising  this matter for open discussion is  just  a\r\n\r\nlittle  hit  too much.

Last night, I remember I pointed out\r\n\r\nthat the Prime Minister also claimed 1, 2, 3, 4,  5,\r\n\r\n6,  7,  8  - many, many points in his letter  to  Tun\r\n\r\nRazak.  Tun  Razak merely answered with  a  six-line\r\n\r\nletter  to  his  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  words,\r\n\r\nindirectly, giving a slap in the face to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Singapore. This is what has  happened.\r\n\r\nSuch  being the case, it is no wonder that there  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a  strong  protest from Mr  Donald  Stephens,\r\n\r\nChief Minister-designate of Sabah, and also from the\r\n\r\nSarawak  politicians about this 50 per cent  labour.\r\n\r\nMr  Donald Stephens and the politicians in  Sarawak\r\n\r\nare  not  slow in quoting the constitution on  their\r\n\r\nState  powers over immigration. On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nSir, search as we might, we cannot find anywhere  in\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution this 50 per cent labour  provision\r\n\r\nwhich  the Prime Minister of Singapore wants  us  to\r\n\r\naccept.  It  is no wonder that we see the ridiculous\r\n\r\nsituation in which we find the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof the Federation, Tun Razak, having to write on the\r\n\r\n18th of July to the Prime Minister that there was no\r\n\r\nuse  to  reply  further  to  his  letters,  and  was\r\n\r\ntherefore returning all those letters to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to Paper Misc. 5 of 1963, the\r\n\r\nlast  letter but one, dated 18th July? It is  only  a\r\n\r\nfew lines and it is worth reading, Sir. It reads:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n`Dear Prime Minister,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n You  will remember that shortly before the  signing\r\n\r\nof  the  formal  agreement for the establishment  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in London on 8th July. 1963, you forwarded\r\n\r\na  number  of  claims  on behalf  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the form of letters. As a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  discussions between Tunku and yourself and  the\r\n\r\nunderstanding reached between you it was agreed that\r\n\r\nthere was no need to reply further to these letters.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, returning them to you herewith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n             (Sgd.)

Has the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister still face to tell us that he has got\r\n\r\nthis and that for the people of Singapore? The whole\r\n\r\ntrouble is that although he receives slaps and kicks\r\n\r\nfrom  the Federation Ministers, the P.A.P. dare  not\r\n\r\nanswer back.

It is pathetic that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has to swallow his pride with words, \"I  am\r\n\r\nhappy to leave it at that\" when he never got what he\r\n\r\nwanted to set. I refer you to the last letter of the\r\n\r\nsame   Paper,  the  last  sentence  of  the   second\r\n\r\nparagraph.

Of course, the P.A.P. cannot  get\r\n\r\nanything out of the Federation. What else can he do?\r\n\r\nHe must of course leave it at that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident, however, reveals the desperate\r\n\r\nsituation in which the Prime Minister found  himself\r\n\r\nin London. He\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  pressured right and left and had to  sign  away\r\n\r\nthe  rights of the people of Singapore in order that\r\n\r\nhe might still have a hope of saving himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident also reveals another aspect of\r\n\r\npolitics in Malaya. That the Prime Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation could make such arrangements that binds a\r\n\r\nState  without  prior consultation  with  the  State\r\n\r\nconcerned,  that  is,  if  the  Prime  Minister   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  allegation was true, shows how  readily\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Government ignores the wishes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  the  various  states  of  the  proposed\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   This  is  an  example  of  great   power\r\n\r\nchauvinism which will always place the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation above the interests of other smaller\r\n\r\nStates. However, to come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 50 per cent labour and contractors' claim of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., if true, would, of course, be  able  to\r\n\r\nbenefit Singapore a bit, just a little, and  only  a\r\n\r\nlittle. Only artisans and skilled workers will  have\r\n\r\nthe  chance  and  they are not  many  in  number  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  it is pertinent  to  ask,  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nindeed  the $150 million loan was used for  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, which we doubt, and so provide jobs for\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore, why then has  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  not  used the same  money  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nitself?  Why have jobs to be provided for in Borneo,\r\n\r\n1,000  miles away, and not here in Singapore itself?\r\n\r\nWould it not be possible then to use not 50 per cent\r\n\r\nlabour,  but 100 per cent labour from Singapore  and\r\n\r\nreally  give  thousands  of  jobs  to  our  tens  of\r\n\r\nthousands of unemployed?

Would the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nagree  to this? That is correct - $30 million a year.\r\n\r\nWe  are spending in Singapore on the various capital\r\n\r\nprojects of the Government, of the Housing Board, of\r\n\r\nthe  Harbour Board and of the Public Utilities Board\r\n\r\nand  so on, somewhere within five or six times  that\r\n\r\namount.

Forty thousand young  men  and  women\r\n\r\nleave  school  every year. Where are  the  jobs  for\r\n\r\nthem?  Why does the P.A.P. not use the $150 million\r\n\r\nto  help  our own young men and women? Why  loan  to\r\n\r\nBorneo?  And  why on such terms? Singapore  borrows\r\n\r\nfrom  the World Bank on terms which the people  call\r\n\r\nhumiliating  but  which  the P.A.P. considers  very\r\n\r\nfair. The World Bank, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiving  a  loan  of only $45 million  to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nrequires  that  the  Singapore  Government  enact  a\r\n\r\nspecial  law  in order to enable the World  Bank  to\r\n\r\nexact  those humiliating terms from Singapore.  What\r\n\r\nis  worse,  all  our Municipal property  worth  many\r\n\r\ntimes  the  $45 million is mortgaged for that  small\r\n\r\npuny  loan.  So what happens? If Singapore  has  to\r\n\r\nloan  $150  million, surely some form  of  terms  as\r\n\r\nimposed  by  the World Bank should he considered  if\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government considers those terms fair and\r\n\r\njust.  I  might  ask,  Sir, if  the  P.A.P.  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  realises  what the interest  of  the  $150\r\n\r\nmillion  will  mean to the people of  Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nalready know, Sir, on 5\ufffd per cent interest, the $100\r\n\r\nmillion  of  the  $150 million loan will  fetch  $55\r\n\r\nmillion in ten years. But if Singapore has to borrow\r\n\r\nmoney - let us assume that it is only on 5\ufffd per cent;\r\n\r\nin  fact, it is more - in order to use that very  same\r\n\r\nmoney to lend interest free to another country, then\r\n\r\nin   fact   the  loss  incurred  by  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  would be twice $55 million.  It  becomes\r\n\r\n$110 million in ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I seem to recollect that the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  did give these figures yesterday.

In so doing,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. has sold Singapore completely  down  the\r\n\r\ndrain, lock, stock and barrel The terms as laid down\r\n\r\nin  the  White Paper are unequal and unjust  enough.\r\n\r\nBut  the  terms in the Malaysia Agreement signed  in\r\n\r\nLondon on the 9th July, 1963, are even more so.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister himself knows this. That is  why  he\r\n\r\nsaid  he signed because of the Tunku, hoping to  use\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku's name as a shield against all criticism.\r\n\r\nAnd he also said over T.V. that he signed because he\r\n\r\nwas  asked to show face to Tan Siew Sin. \"Oh,  never\r\n\r\nmind,\" he said. He sounded very apologetic over T.V.\r\n\r\nNever  mind with the people's money? I remember  how\r\n\r\nwhen he similarly gave a T.V. show in his address to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Harbour Board workers. He related the\r\n\r\nstory  of  how the Manager of the Singapore  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard  consulted him about a certain worker, and  he\r\n\r\nsaid - it  came very clearly over the radio and  T.V.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- \"Sack him. The Manager consulted me and I said,\r\n\r\n`Sack  him'.\"  How very strong and  powerful.  \"Sack\r\n\r\nhim,\" he said. But not with the people's money.  Not\r\n\r\nwith  the Tunku. He would not dare. The P.A.P. never\r\n\r\nreally  consider  the interests  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He  does  not give any  thought  to  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore. If he had done\r\n\r\nso,  he would not have signed away the rights of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore in this easy manner.  Just  to\r\n\r\ngive  face  to  this person or that person.  However\r\n\r\npretty  a face may be, I am sure it is not worth  so\r\n\r\nmany millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had also boasted at one stage that he was not the Sultan of Brunei. Of course, different meanings can be read into those words; it depends on whether it is meant to be derogatory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  otherwise. We have seen today that the Sultan of\r\n\r\nBrunei at least has the guts to say No. He has shown\r\n\r\nthat  he  has more guts than our Prime Minister.  He\r\n\r\nhas  enough guts to stand up for his rights and  the\r\n\r\nrights of Brunei, in spite of all the pressure  from\r\n\r\nthe  British.  Has Lee Kuan Yew similarly  withstood\r\n\r\nthe pressure from the British and the Federation? He\r\n\r\nhas not. Why has he not? The reasons are not far  to\r\n\r\nseek.

If  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Ministers had, the result of the whole merger\r\n\r\nnegotiations would have been entirely different. The\r\n\r\nBritish  and  the  Federation  negotiated   on   the\r\n\r\nstrength  of their guns and their jets.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  no  such  strength.

It must be deeply rooted in at least  a\r\n\r\nsection of the people whose interests it represents.\r\n\r\nIt  must  be  able  to exercise influence  over  the\r\n\r\npeople,  lead them and mobilise them to  action,  so\r\n\r\nthat the political aims and ideals may be realised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today superficially the P.A.P. appears to be a\r\n\r\n\"force\".  It  is still the Government. Yes.  It  can\r\n\r\nstill  use  the Government machinery for  its  party\r\n\r\npurposes.  Yes.  It  can  still  pass  laws  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  that is, so long as those laws correspond\r\n\r\nwith the interests of a section of the Opposition in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. It can still monopolise the  use  of\r\n\r\nthe  radio and television. Yes. And it can still nut\r\n\r\npressure  on the Singapore newspapers. Yes.  It  can\r\n\r\nstill   use   the  Police  Force  on  its  political\r\n\r\nopponents. Yes. It can still make use of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice to help the Party work. Yes. It can use  the\r\n\r\ncourts   to   prosecute   and  persecute   political\r\n\r\nopponents. Yes. It can even bring up fictitious  and\r\n\r\nfrivolous  charges  of breach of  privilege  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  against political opponents. It can  pressure\r\n\r\npeople  into \"welcoming\" the Prime Minister. It  can\r\n\r\norder  school students to line the streets.  It  can\r\n\r\nintimidate  and bribe certain people into supporting\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  But all power and  strength  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  the control over the State machinery, and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  this power because of its control  over\r\n\r\nthe  State  machinery. Bu: iii  terms  of  the  real\r\n\r\nmeaning of a political force, i.e. whether or not it\r\n\r\nrepresents the people, the P.A.P. is not a political\r\n\r\nforce.  The Prime Minister may bluster and  posture,\r\n\r\nbeat his chest, heat his drum, shout and talk tough,\r\n\r\nbut he and the P.A.P. Ministers themselves know that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is not a force. It does not  even  dare\r\n\r\nhold  a  mass rally, as I have said. We could  count\r\n\r\nthe  number  of people who attended the P.A.P. mass\r\n\r\nrallies during the referendum campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. came to power by posing itself as a left-wing Party representing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the workers of Singapore.  It  was\r\n\r\nlargely  due  to  the  support  of  the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore that the P.A.P. came to control the  State\r\n\r\nmachinery.  But  this posturing of P.A.P.  Ministers\r\n\r\nwas  soon  exposed  and  the P.A.P. has  completely\r\n\r\nbetrayed  the people who brought it into power.  But\r\n\r\nso long as the system of one-man-one-Vote exists and\r\n\r\nstill operates, however inadequately, those who  put\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. into power can similarly take away  that\r\n\r\npower from the P.A.P. political opportunists. It  is\r\n\r\njust  a  question  of time. That is  why  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  condemned this one-man-one-vote system  in\r\n\r\nhis  talk  to  the  civil servants last  year.  That\r\n\r\nsystem  still works however inadequately today,  and\r\n\r\nit  will  become the undoing of the  P.A.P.  And  in\r\n\r\nspite of the P.A.P. Ministers' love for power,  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  be able to prevent this power from  being\r\n\r\ntaken  away  from  them. Knowing  this,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters   have   nightly   been   sleeping    with\r\n\r\nMachiavelli  to scheme out plans to keep  themselves\r\n\r\nin  power.  Hence the undemocratic clause 29:  hence\r\n\r\nthe dishonest and undemocratic Referendum: hence the\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance; hence the Singapore (Elections\r\n\r\nto the Federal House of Representatives) Bill. Both\r\n\r\nthese Bills have now been defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite all the Prime Minister's blustering\r\n\r\nabout  going  back  to meet the people, the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters are still doing their best to cling on  to\r\n\r\npower  for  as long as possible, because  they  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  moment  they lose control  of  the  State\r\n\r\nmachinery, they will not be able to use the power of\r\n\r\nthe  State  represented by the police,  troops,  the courts,  the  prisons; and this is  very  important,\r\n\r\nSir, the power of deprivation of citizenship and the\r\n\r\npower  of  banishment.  When that  time  comes,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Ministers will sink into oblivion, buried  by\r\n\r\nhistory  - according  to  the  words  of  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  It will be the end of an era - again  the\r\n\r\nwords  of  the  Prime Minister - the  P.A.P. era  of\r\n\r\narrogance, bully, and Fascist dictatorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., as I have said, is not a political\r\n\r\nforce. The Ministers know it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   they   are  making  full  use   of   all   the\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  travel  about  and  to  live   in\r\n\r\ngrandeur while the going is still good, so to speak.\r\n\r\nThe  moment general elections take place, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters will be habis. The Ministers will have  to\r\n\r\nlook  for new jobs, and the Back-benchers will  have\r\n\r\nto  find new moorings. That will be the end  of  the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of real political strength, the\r\n\r\nAlliance  is  today  stronger than  the  P.A.P.  The\r\n\r\nAlliance    has    consistently   represented    the\r\n\r\nreactionary   forces  in  Singapore   and   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  whereas the P.A.P. Ministers  are  only\r\n\r\nopportunists  who  came to power  on  the  Left-wing\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the workers, and who for the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears  have  been clinging on to power on Right-wing\r\n\r\nsupport.  You  will remember, Sir,  last  night  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  talked  very  glibly  of  the  four\r\n\r\nforces;   naming   the   British   Government,   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government, the Singapore Government, and\r\n\r\nthe  Communists as the four forces. I do  not  know,\r\n\r\nSir,  but I think he must have been talking  through\r\n\r\nhis hat because that is mere wishful thinking. There\r\n\r\nare  only  two forces as far as we can see  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  or  anywhere. They are the  forces  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists and imperialists and the forces of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  not  the P.A.P. Today it is the reactionary\r\n\r\nforces  which are making use of the P.A.P. and  not\r\n\r\nthe other way round. The P.A.P. thought of itself as\r\n\r\nbeing  indispensable to the Left at one  time.  That\r\n\r\nhas been proved false. Similarly the P.A.P. wants to\r\n\r\ntell  the British who are the real force behind  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia scheme, that the P.A.P. is indispensable in\r\n\r\nthe  fight against the Communist bogey. But  however\r\n\r\nmuch the British may want to protect the P.A.P. for\r\n\r\njust a little while perhaps, we have already seen in\r\n\r\nthis  House  that the moment the reactionaries  have\r\n\r\ndone with the P.A.P. -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture (Mr Rajaratnam): To join\r\n\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - they will leave the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nfend  for itself, and will be doing everything  they\r\n\r\ncan indirectly to bring the P.A.P. down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have repeatedly said that the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\ntoday  is  a Government only on sufferance.  Without\r\n\r\nthe  reactionary prop, the P.A.P. will  tumble  just\r\n\r\nlike  a house built with a pack of cards. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas no solid foundation, no reinforced concrete,  no\r\n\r\npiling in its foundations, and it is going to  fall,\r\n\r\nand  will certainly fall, very soon. A matter of one\r\n\r\nor  two  months maybe, and that is all the Ministers\r\n\r\ncan  hope for. The reactionary forces have made  use\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.  The Prime Minister  thinks  he  can\r\n\r\ncalculate  but he forgets all the time - to  use  his\r\n\r\nown  words  - the electronic computer which  has  300\r\n\r\nyears  of  experience  of  colonial  domination  and\r\n\r\nexploitation behind it. This electronic computer  is\r\n\r\nall   the   time  directing  affairs   quietly   and\r\n\r\nunobtrusively  behind the scenes,  manipulating  the\r\n\r\nstooges  and the puppets without even letting  these\r\n\r\nstooges  and  puppets realise that  they  have  been\r\n\r\nmanipulated. The electronic computer encourages  the\r\n\r\nfeeling  of  egoism and opportunism of  self-centred\r\n\r\npoliticians, so that they begin to have the illusion\r\n\r\nthat what they were made to do and what they were in\r\n\r\nfact  directed  to do were creations of  their  own.\r\n\r\nThus  it  is  that  the Prime Minister  thinks  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  his own creation. There is  a  saying,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  those whom the gods would destroy,  they\r\n\r\nfirst make mad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It seems to me that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  must  be completely mad with  nuts  loose\r\n\r\nhere  and  there beneath their skulls  for  them  to\r\n\r\nharbour  such  illusions that  they  themselves  had\r\n\r\nsuggested  Malaysia. But the ridiculous position  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. today  is  this:  although  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  have done everything possible  to  please\r\n\r\nthe Federation, they are nevertheless not trusted by\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. The Federation prefers  to  entrust\r\n\r\nits interests to their own friends in the S.P.A. at\r\n\r\none  time  and  the Alliance now in  Singapore.  And\r\n\r\nhowever  much  the  P.A.P. may  try  to  split  the\r\n\r\nAlliance, one component from another component,  the\r\n\r\nM.C.A. from the U.M.N.O. by denigrating the  M.C.A.\r\n\r\nand the ex-S.P.A. and praising to the skies the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. and especially the Tunku, Tun Razak and Dr\r\n\r\nIsmail,  the P.A.P. will not be able to  succeed  in\r\n\r\ngaining the favour of the Federation. If anything is\r\n\r\nleft behind after the big feast, the crumbs will  be\r\n\r\nleft  to  the P.A.P. Ministers. The P.A.P. Ministers\r\n\r\nwill  only be able to get the crumbs from the table,\r\n\r\nbut unfortunately for them even these crumbs may not\r\n\r\nbe  given to them, who are waiting around the  table\r\n\r\nwith  open  mouths, like dogs for  food  from  their\r\n\r\nmaster.  The Federation knows the true character  of\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.  Ministers  because  opportunists   are\r\n\r\nopportunists. If the P.A.P. opportunists can  betray\r\n\r\nthe  Left-wing movement and the workers who put them\r\n\r\ninto  power, so these same opportunists can one  day\r\n\r\nsimilarly    betray   the   Right-wing    and    the\r\n\r\nreactionaries  if  the  P.A.P.  Ministers  find   it\r\n\r\nnecessary to do so in order to cling to office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is in a dilemma because of its own\r\n\r\nopportunism. On the one hand, it is rejected by  the\r\n\r\nworking  class movement of Singapore, and indeed  of\r\n\r\nthe whole Malaysia region. We saw how the P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nexpelled  by the Conference of Socialist Parties  in\r\n\r\nJanuary 1962 in Kuala Lumpur. On the other hand, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  not  trusted  by the  reactionaries  and\r\n\r\ncommunal forces in the region although made  use  of\r\n\r\nby  them. That is the tragedy of the P.A.P. It  does\r\n\r\nnot   represent  the  interests  of  any  particular\r\n\r\nsection  of  the  people.  Today,  the  P.A.P. may\r\n\r\naccelerate  promotions, give  medals  to  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants and praise them. But other than for a small\r\n\r\nnumber,  the  P.A.P. will not be able to  get  their\r\n\r\nsupport. The P.A.P. remains a force only because  of\r\n\r\nits   temporary  - that  is  a  very  important  word\r\n\r\n- temporary  - control  of the  State  machinery.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is legally in power, but it has already  been\r\n\r\nmorally  discredited  and rejected  by  the  people.\r\n\r\nTheir position is not unlike the position of the Lim\r\n\r\nYew Hock Government just before the 1959 elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, knowing the situation, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  use  Machiavellian methods  and  hope  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  in  an  unsettled  and  unstable  political\r\n\r\nsituation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  they survive by their skill in brinkmanship  by\r\n\r\nplaying  one  political force against another.  But.\r\n\r\nSir, opportunistic politics cannot last. History  is\r\n\r\nnot created by the so-called genius or brilliance of\r\n\r\na  few leaders. Opportunist leaders do not represent\r\n\r\nthe  people. They are on the stage for a  while  and\r\n\r\nthey  disappear. Opportunists do not  represent  the\r\n\r\nhopes  and aspirations of the people. From this,  we\r\n\r\ncan  understand why the P.A.P. is cracking  its  so-called  cleverness and brilliance to twist and  turn\r\n\r\nand  to distort. But one falsehood after another  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. has been exposed. Their citizenship bluff\r\n\r\nwas  exposed. They have to change the name  \"Federal\r\n\r\nNational\"  into  the  words  \"Malaysian  Citizenship\r\n\r\n(Singapore)\".  It is becoming more  and  more  clear\r\n\r\ntoday  to  the  people of Singapore  that  Malaysian\r\n\r\nCitizenship   (Singapore)  is  not   the   same   as\r\n\r\nFederation Citizenship. In fact, a Singapore citizen\r\n\r\nnot only gets second-class citizenship in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger  deal, but he also stands in grave danger  of\r\n\r\nlosing    his    original   Singapore    citizenship\r\n\r\naltogether. This is one aspect of the great sell-out\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. In the P.A.P. merger proposals we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have a common citizenship. I have amply  proved\r\n\r\nthis  last night. The Federation, Sabah and  Sarawak\r\n\r\ncitizens  are  in  one group. The Singapore  citizen\r\n\r\nstands isolated in another group. Then where is  the\r\n\r\ncommon  citizenship?  Where is the  national  unity?\r\n\r\nBut, of course, the P.A.P. Ministers are very clever\r\n\r\nbluffers and they even bluffed the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\nBut  anyway,  we  can take heart  that  this  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbluffing will be gone forever very soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister says we share a common fate with the Federation. Yes. I think we will. But in the present context, only insofar as our fate will be tied to the fate of the Federation if the unjust merger is pushed through. But we shall not share a common political life. The citizenship provisions and the restrictions on the freedom of travel will\r\n\r\nsee  to  that. We shall share a common fate  in  the\r\n\r\nrespect  that  we  in Singapore will  not  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to decide our own future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are part of Afro-Asia. We stand for\r\n\r\nneutrality and anti-colonialism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand anti-imperialism. But the Federation policy, for\r\n\r\nexample,  is  tied to the chariot wheel  of  Western\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and  imperialism. Yet  because  of  the\r\n\r\nmerger  and Malaysia, we become tied hand and  foot,\r\n\r\nat  least temporarily, and we cannot decide our  own\r\n\r\nfuture as regards foreign policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis are entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the P.A.P. We stand on the  side  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers,  the  exploited and  down-trodden.  We\r\n\r\nrepresent  their  interests. They are  part  of  the\r\n\r\nforce  that  will decide the future of  mankind.  We\r\n\r\nhave  not  misjudged  any  situation  as  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said. The Prime Minister gives  himself\r\n\r\ntoo  much  credit. This is of course because  he  is\r\n\r\narrogant  as usual and imagines himself to  be  more\r\n\r\nclever,  more brilliant, than the rest  of  mankind.\r\n\r\nWe,  on  the  other hand, practise humility  and  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  our limitations. We recognise  also  that\r\n\r\nforever  we  shall be students of politics.  We  are\r\n\r\nlearning  every day. But we also see  the  situation\r\n\r\nvery  clearly.  We see the future very  clearly.  We\r\n\r\nknow what is coming. We see the march of history. We\r\n\r\nsee history progressively going forward from slavery\r\n\r\nto feudalism, from feudalism to capitalism, and from\r\n\r\ncapitalism  to  socialism. This is  inevitable.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister does not know how to  use  the  word\r\n\r\n\"inevitable\", Sir. This is inevitable.  History  has\r\n\r\nproved   it.   Malaysia  is  not  inevitable.   That\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  \"inevitability\" is all  propaganda.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. says  this  to take away the  will  and  the\r\n\r\nfighting  spirit of the people. The P.A.P. hopes  to\r\n\r\nuse this word \"inevitable\" to take away the fighting\r\n\r\nstrength  and resistance of the people against  neo-colonialist  Malaysia.  But Malaysia's  downfall  is\r\n\r\ninevitable;  just  as the fall  of  colonialism  and\r\n\r\nimperialism  is inevitable; just as the  triumph  of\r\n\r\nsocialism is inevitable; and just as the realisation\r\n\r\nof  the  hopes  and  aspirations of  the  people  is\r\n\r\ninevitable:  just as the victory of the people  over\r\n\r\nall  reactionary forces represented in a  small  way\r\n\r\ntoday in Singapore by the P.A.P. is inevitable. That\r\n\r\nis  the meaning of the word \"inevitable\". The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas been using the word wrongly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. talks of chopping off of heads. But\r\n\r\nhistory is not decided by the chopping off of heads.\r\n\r\nMillions  of people have sacrificed their  lives  in\r\n\r\nthe past and millions of people will sacrifice their\r\n\r\nlives  in  the future. But history marches  forward.\r\n\r\nThe  march may be slower at times and may be  faster\r\n\r\nat  times. But history marches forward and advances,\r\n\r\nand  no  force on earth, much less the  puny  little\r\n\r\nP.A.P. infantile opportunistic force, can stop  such\r\n\r\nadvance. Today, the national liberation movement  is\r\n\r\nsteadily advancing and growing in strength the world\r\n\r\nover.  We  have seen heads chopped off  and  put  on\r\n\r\nspike  poles in Angola. When I was in London, I  saw\r\n\r\nspecial  pictures of how the Portuguese colonialists\r\n\r\nand  imperialists have chopped off the heads of  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  fighters in order to frighten  the  people.\r\n\r\nBut  today in Angola the lighting is still going on,\r\n\r\nand  more  and  more  of the people  in  Africa  are\r\n\r\nbacking  the people in Angola helping them to  drive\r\n\r\nout  the Portuguese imperialists. Chopping off heads\r\n\r\nwill   not   stop   history.  We  have   seen   more\r\n\r\nunbelievable atrocities in other colonial countries,\r\n\r\nbut  history advances and socialism must  inevitably\r\n\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, therefore, not misjudged the situation. It\r\n\r\nis  opportunists  like the Prime  Minister  and  his\r\n\r\nother  Ministers who have misjudged  the  situation,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  falsely  imagine  that  a  couple  of\r\n\r\nindividuals can thwart the march of history. We have\r\n\r\nabsolute confidence in the future, and we know  that\r\n\r\nwe  will win, whatever the P.A.P. may try to do. The\r\n\r\nfuture   lies  with  the  people.  Let  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters themselves not misjudge the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the predicament the P.A.P. is in, we\r\n\r\nalso understand why the P.A.P. acts in the manner it\r\n\r\ndoes.  As  I have said, the P.A.P. has not the  mass\r\n\r\nsupport.  It  knows it has sold the  rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. But for its own survival,  it\r\n\r\nneeds  to cover the sell-out somehow, with  hope  of\r\n\r\ngaining the support of the people. Hence the frantic\r\n\r\npreparation  of the P.A.P. propaganda  machinery  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  traitor a hero's welcome and to build  up\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister as a fighter for the interests of\r\n\r\nthe people. But this farce is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow completely exposed. All Singapore knows that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is going down as a result of the sell-out.  I\r\n\r\nwill not speak very much longer, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today Malaysia exerts an oppressive shadow over the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  South-East  Asia.  Pro-Malaysia  salesmen\r\n\r\nshout  deceptive  slogans of prosperity,  happiness,\r\n\r\nnational unity, independence, stability and national\r\n\r\nsecurity  through Malaysia. But we  have  seen  very\r\n\r\nclearly  before our eyes that instead of  prosperity\r\n\r\nwe  have promises of extra burdens and extra  taxes.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  give thousands of millions of  dollars\r\n\r\naway.  The Johore Causeway will remain a barrier  to\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  travel and also to trade,  if,  at  any\r\n\r\ntime,  the  Federation decides  to  levy  production\r\n\r\ntaxes   and  extra  duties  on  goods  produced   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Instead of happiness, there is repression\r\n\r\nand  widespread bitterness and sorrow over the land.\r\n\r\nNo  greater  issue divides the people  of  our  land\r\n\r\ntoday  than  the  issue  of  Malaysia.  Instead   of\r\n\r\nnational  unity,  there  is now  national  disunity.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  independence  we  get  neo-colonialism.\r\n\r\nInstead of stability and national security, there is\r\n\r\nstrife  and  tension, and today's summit meeting  in\r\n\r\nManila  will  decide whether or not  there  will  be\r\n\r\nfurther  threats  to  peace in South-East  Asia.  At\r\n\r\npresent Malaysia can be born only on the support  of\r\n\r\nBritish  might.  But  without  the  support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, such military imposition on the people  will\r\n\r\nnot  make  Malaysia work. Malaysia  cannot  succeed,\r\n\r\ntherefore. Like the West Indies Federation  and  the\r\n\r\nCentral African Federation, Malaysia must inevitably\r\n\r\nfail.  Pro-Malaysia  salesmen hope  to  make  people\r\n\r\nbelieve  that Malaysia is formed to fight Communism.\r\n\r\nThey  say  that only the Communists oppose Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThis  is,  of  course, the pet excuse  used  by  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists and their stooges for every  aggressive\r\n\r\naction  of  theirs  against staunch anti-colonialist\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents. And to justify  their  Fascist\r\n\r\nand  repressive  actions against  those  who  oppose\r\n\r\nMalaysia, and especially those of us in the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, the British colonialists and their  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nstooges  have  invoked  the  Communist  bogey.   But\r\n\r\ncuriously enough,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  who  oppose Malaysia most fiercely  and  have\r\n\r\neven resorted to armed struggle against Malaysia are\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  in Brunei. And no one has  ever  called\r\n\r\nthem  Communists. From this alone, we  can  see  how\r\n\r\nridiculous and absurd the P.A.P. charges  are.  But,\r\n\r\nof  course,  the  P.A.P. Ministers  are  experts  at\r\n\r\ntelling  falsehoods. I remember Senator Tan  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  saying this of the Prime Minister:  that\r\n\r\n\"he  is  capable of saying anything as  long  as  it\r\n\r\nserves  his  purpose. Nothing is too low  for  him,\"\r\n\r\ni.e. our Prime Minister. However, to come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is a neo-colonialist plot designed to\r\n\r\nprotect  British military, political,  and  economic\r\n\r\ninterests  in  the  region. It is also  designed  to\r\n\r\nfrustrate  the hopes and aspirations of  the  people\r\n\r\nfor  self-determination, democracy, and freedom.  It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  represent the spontaneous desire  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the region for a union.  It  is  a  plan\r\n\r\nimposed  from  above on the people and  intended  to\r\n\r\nmake  the whole of South-East Asia a strategic  bloc\r\n\r\nin  the  service of Western colonial domination  and\r\n\r\nexploitation. Malaysia is only the political  aspect\r\n\r\nof the British Far East Unified Command which covers\r\n\r\nexactly the same area of Malaysia. In fact, Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill  only  be an extension of the working  room  of\r\n\r\nSEATO.  Malaysia, therefore, in fact, is a  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  SEATO  bloc. In this connection,  Sir,  I  must\r\n\r\nrefer  you  to Article VI of the Malaysia Agreement,\r\n\r\npage 2 of Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963. This Article is the\r\n\r\nessence of Malaysia. Let me read it out, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Agreement on External Defence and Mutual\r\n\r\nAssistance  between  the Government  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  and  the  Government of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya on 12th October, 1957, and its annexes  shall\r\n\r\napply  to  all  territories  of  Malaysia,  and  any\r\n\r\nreference  in  that Agreement to the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya shall be deemed to apply to Malaysia, subject\r\n\r\nto  the proviso that the Government of Malaysia will\r\n\r\nafford  to the Government of the United Kingdom  the\r\n\r\nright  to  continue to maintain the bases and  other\r\n\r\nfacilities  at  present occupied  by  their  Service\r\n\r\nauthorities within the State of Singapore  and  will\r\n\r\npermit the Government of the United Kingdom to  make\r\n\r\nsuch  use  of  these  bases and facilities  as  that\r\n\r\nGovernment may consider necessary for the purpose of\r\n\r\nassisting  in  the  defence  of  Malaysia,  and  for\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  defence and for  the  preservation  of\r\n\r\npeace  in  South-East Asia. The application  of  the\r\n\r\nsaid Agreement shall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  subject  to the provisions of Annex  F  to  this\r\n\r\nAgreement  (relating primarily to Service  lands  in\r\n\r\nSingapore).'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  this is the essence of the Malaysia Agreement.\r\n\r\nIf  this Article VI was not in this Agreement, there\r\n\r\nwould be no Malaysia. That is important. And for the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  to say that he does  not  know  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of \"neo-colonialism\", I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nhe  go  back to school and learn politics  all  over\r\n\r\nagain.  This Agreement was signed in London  on  the\r\n\r\n9th July, and this Article extends the Anglo-Malayan\r\n\r\nDefence  Treaty  to  the whole Malaysia  region.  It\r\n\r\ngives the U.K. Government the right -mind you,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  right  to imperialists thousands of miles  away\r\n\r\n- to  maintain bases and other facilities in the five\r\n\r\nterritories for so-called U.K. defence for which the\r\n\r\nBritish  Far  East  Unified  Command  was  specially\r\n\r\ncreated. If we want to understand Malaysia, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nmust   look  at  it  from  this  perspective.   Then\r\n\r\nimmediately  we can understand why all  the  neutral\r\n\r\ncountries in Afro-Asia are opposed to Malaysia.  And\r\n\r\nwe  will  immediately understand  why  Indonesia  is\r\n\r\nopposed  to  Malaysia. We will also  understand  why\r\n\r\nBritain,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  Japan,  Canada,\r\n\r\nItaly,  France,  and, of course, the United  States,\r\n\r\nsupport Malaysia. Then we understand everything. All\r\n\r\nthe  pieces in the jig-saw puzzle fit into place and\r\n\r\nthe  whole  picture is presented right  before  you.\r\n\r\nHowever, within the proposed Malaysia region itself,\r\n\r\nopposition to Malaysia has already resulted  in  the\r\n\r\nBrunei  uprising  and  guerilla  warfare  over   all\r\n\r\nBorneo.  The Government of the Federation will  have\r\n\r\nto  expand very greatly their armed forces, and that\r\n\r\nis  why  Singapore will have to pay so much annually\r\n\r\nto   the  Federation.  That  is  why  Singapore   is\r\n\r\ncompelled  to loan - a very nice word euphemistically\r\n\r\n- to  \"loan\"  $150 million to the Federation  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch  for  the development of the Borneo territories\r\n\r\nas  for  the expansion of defence - I think it should\r\n\r\nbe  offence - capital expenditure. It should  not  be\r\n\r\ndefence,  in  fact. For their own selfish  interests\r\n\r\ntoday, the P.A.P. Ministers have signed the Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement  which  seeks to push Singapore  into  the\r\n\r\nFederation bound hand and foot. We have opposed this\r\n\r\nall along but the P.A.P. claims that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  has a mandate from the people. The P.A.P. claims\r\n\r\nthat the White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 has been passed\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly,  and  that  it  has  later  been\r\n\r\nendorsed  by  the people in the sham referendum.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, this is not really true. The P.A.P. has  the\r\n\r\nso-called mandate only by the most undemocratic  and\r\n\r\ndishonest  means. But even if what  the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nclaimed  was true, that claim cannot hold  true  any\r\n\r\nlonger  today.  The  P.A.P. has legal  authority  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  on  behalf of Singapore only  within  the\r\n\r\nlimits  clearly  defined in  the  White  Paper.  Any\r\n\r\nvariation  and any departure from this  White  Paper\r\n\r\nand  from  the explanations and assurances given  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Ministers therefore cannot be valid.  It\r\n\r\nbecomes ultra vires in many ways of speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already pointed out the many variations and\r\n\r\ndepartures  from  Cmd. Paper  33  of  1961  in  this\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement. The P.A.P. has no  moral  right\r\n\r\nand  even legal right to vary and depart so very far\r\n\r\nfrom  the  White  Paper.  Any  wide  variation   and\r\n\r\ndeparture    especially   involving   totally    new\r\n\r\nprinciples  must  first have  a  mandate  from  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  We  had  a  debate on the  progress  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  talks  last month following  a  statement\r\n\r\nfrom the Prime Minister. But the P.A.P. did not have\r\n\r\na  mandate  from this House to vary and depart  from\r\n\r\nthe White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961. Now since there are\r\n\r\nwide  variations and departures from the White Paper\r\n\r\nand since the P.A.P. did not have a mandate from the\r\n\r\nHouse  to  vary  and depart from  the  White  Paper,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it must be condemned for signing such  an\r\n\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these variations and departures had been\r\n\r\nadvantageous  to the people of Singapore,  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  been  easier  to  accept such  variations  and\r\n\r\ndepartures. But these variations and departures  are\r\n\r\ncompletely  to  the disadvantage of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. In fact, more and more of our powers have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  away  and  all the  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nproposed Constitution merely seek to further enslave\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore. All the safeguards,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  for the protection of citizenship acquired\r\n\r\nby the people not born in Singapore are now gone and\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlose their own original Singapore citizenship if  at\r\n\r\nany time the Federation politicians decide to cancel\r\n\r\nthe   so-called   automatic  Malaysian   citizenship\r\n\r\n(Singapore).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then emergency powers are given to the Federation\r\n\r\nto   impose   wartime  emergency   regulations   and\r\n\r\nrestrictions on Singapore even when all is peace and\r\n\r\nquiet   and  when  there  is  no  war,  no  external\r\n\r\naggression and no internal disturbance in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThen the people of Singapore have been squeezed  and\r\n\r\nsoaked.  Singapore has to pay more than $150 million\r\n\r\nannually  to the Federation in order that  Singapore\r\n\r\nmay  serve  the Federation. A $150 million  loan  is\r\n\r\ngiven   almost  completely  interest  free  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  and  more  likely  than  not  the  $150\r\n\r\nmillion  will also be gone with the wind. In return,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  obtained a common  market  in  which\r\n\r\nalmost  all  the  advantages are on  the  Federation\r\n\r\nside.   Singapore  industries  will  not  have   the\r\n\r\nprotection  and safeguards for expansion.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  common  market in which the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nsuch  great  faith  will not encourage  and  promote\r\n\r\nlocal   industries.   It  will   merely   facilitate\r\n\r\nexploitation of Singapore by foreign capital through\r\n\r\nthe benefits of pioneer status, the exploitation  of\r\n\r\ncomparatively cheap local labour, and the escape  of\r\n\r\nheavy taxes in the countries of the foreign monopoly\r\n\r\ncapitalists. This is the neo-colonialism  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. does not seem able to understand. But what is\r\n\r\nworse,  the  free port status of Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\nalmost  completely lost in 12 years from  now.  This\r\n\r\ncan  only mean loss of trade, especially the tourist\r\n\r\ntrade,  with increased cost of living for the people\r\n\r\nand  even  loss of employment for the thousands  now\r\n\r\ngainfully employed. The exchange of letters  between\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Government  and   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  Singapore Government  and  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government contained in  Misc.  5  of  1963\r\n\r\nclearly  states the position. The P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\ncannot  bluff  the people that its own  claims  have\r\n\r\nbecome part of the agreement when they in fact  have\r\n\r\nnot been agreed to by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation and the British Governments. The Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement  is  therefore completely unacceptable  to\r\n\r\nthis  House and to the people of Singapore. En fact,\r\n\r\nthe  whole Agreement is a sell-out of all the rights\r\n\r\nand  interests  of  the  people  of  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nAgreement must therefore be repudiated and torn up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constitutional future of Singapore affects each\r\n\r\nand  every  one of us in the country. The people  of\r\n\r\nthe  country must have their basic rights  of  self-determination  to  decide their  own  constitutional\r\n\r\nfuture.  The 31st of August, 1963, is the date  that\r\n\r\nhas  been  set aside by the powers-that-be  for  the\r\n\r\nincorporation   of  Singapore  into   the   proposed\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The  P.A.P. conducted a  sham  referendum\r\n\r\nwhich  did not, and could not, reflect the will  and\r\n\r\ndesire of the people freely expressed. The people of\r\n\r\nSingapore must therefore be given the opportunity to\r\n\r\ntruly  and  genuinely  decide on  their  own  future\r\n\r\nbefore  the  date  set down for the inauguration  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government has been defeated on three\r\n\r\noccasions in the past few days and the Leader of the\r\n\r\nHouse has already solemnly said that there will soon\r\n\r\nhe  a  general election. It is clear that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncannot  conduct a fair and democratic election.  The\r\n\r\nsham  referendum is proof of that. The recent defeat\r\n\r\nof both the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections\r\n\r\n(Temporary  Provisions)  (Amendment)  Bill  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  (Elections  to  the  Federal   House   of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives)  Bill  further   prove   that   all\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties  cannot  trust  the  P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nconduct  a fair election. The general election  must\r\n\r\ntherefore  be conducted and supervised by a  neutral\r\n\r\nbody.  We  suggest that such a neutral body  be  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a precondition to the general election, of\r\n\r\ncourse,    all   political   detainees    must    be\r\n\r\nunconditionally   released   and    all    political\r\n\r\nactivities in Singapore normalised. The basic rights\r\n\r\nand  freedoms of speech and publication, association\r\n\r\nand  assembly must be restored. Once the people have\r\n\r\nelected  their  new  representatives,  these   newly\r\n\r\nelected representatives of the people can then  hold\r\n\r\nfresh constitutional talks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the United Kingdom Government. That,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthe way to allow the people of Singapore a chance to\r\n\r\ndecide on their own future. We ask the House to  let\r\n\r\nthe people decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few last words before I close. We want to warn\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., the Alliance and the British  that  the\r\n\r\narrests on 2nd February cannot and will not help the\r\n\r\nreactionaries  and  the  colonialists.  As  I   have\r\n\r\nalready   pointed  out,  history  advances,  history\r\n\r\nmarches forward. No force can prevent or block  this\r\n\r\nmarch  forward  of history. Arrests now  or  at  any\r\n\r\nfuture  time  will not be able to  help  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  to cling to office any longer.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assemblymen  of the Barisan  Sosialis  will  be\r\n\r\nprosecuted in the court by the P.A.P.

Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlistening to the Member for Queenstown, he took  the\r\n\r\nFloor  yesterday at 5.30 p.m. and maintained  it  up\r\n\r\ntill midnight, which is, excluding the dinner break,\r\n\r\nI  think  5\ufffd hours. And this afternoon from 2.30  to 4.15  p.m., which is a little under two hours, which\r\n\r\nmakes it 7\ufffd hours -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The arithmetic from this side\r\n\r\nis 6\ufffd hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged for the\r\n\r\narithmetic - 6\ufffd hours. I think he has fallen short of\r\n\r\nhis past performance, which I think exceeded that by\r\n\r\none  hour.  But anyway, listening to the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  -  and  I  have  listened  to  him  very\r\n\r\ncarefully  when  I have been in the Chamber  - I  was\r\n\r\nreminded  of  the  statement  the  Hon, the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  made just before he set off to London  for\r\n\r\nthe constitutional talks. I hope I am not misquoting\r\n\r\nhim,  but if I remember correctly, he said, \"I shall\r\n\r\nout-talk them; I shall out-squat them.\" Now, I think\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown has out-talked the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  the length of time spoken.  Does  that\r\n\r\nmake  the Member for Queenstown the victor? I hardly\r\n\r\nthink so, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming back to the motion before the House.\r\n\r\nBefore I deal with the merits of the motion, I  wish\r\n\r\nto make one matter very clear indeed to the House as\r\n\r\na  whole, Mr Speaker, Sir, more particularly to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  the Government seem to  be  in  some\r\n\r\ndanger of getting their own party interests mixed up\r\n\r\nwith  what, in my view, are national interests. Sir,\r\n\r\nmy  Party,  the  Alliance,  and  I  personally  have\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly been behind the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nin   the  matter  of  Malaysia.  We  have  been   so\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly behind the Government in this - and  I\r\n\r\nrecollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I appeared on  the\r\n\r\nsame platform as the Prime Minister did, much to the\r\n\r\ndisgust  of  some  Members of my own  Party.  I  was\r\n\r\nalmost on the mat for it. It was by the skin  of  my\r\n\r\nteeth  that I escaped censure proceedings. I escaped\r\n\r\nit  on the basis that this was a national matter. We\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Alliance and the P.A.P. spoke  the  same\r\n\r\nlanguage  in terms of effect, the words  might  have\r\n\r\nbeen different. But in terms of effect, we spoke the\r\n\r\nsame  language. There was no divergence of views  on\r\n\r\nthis. Therefore, I really cannot understand why  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government, after Malaysia has almost  been\r\n\r\nreached,  agreements concluded and  we  are  on  the\r\n\r\nverge  of Malaysia, should accuse the Alliance Party\r\n\r\nnow of being against Malaysia. Surely, no one in his\r\n\r\nright  senses  in  Singapore, no one  in  his  right\r\n\r\nsenses in the Federation, no one in his right senses\r\n\r\nin the three Bornean territories can ever think that\r\n\r\nwe in the Alliance can ever be against Malaysia. Are\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government out of their senses?  Or  are\r\n\r\nthey trying to make political capital out of this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give full credit to the Prime Minister for having\r\n\r\nbrought  the  ship of Malaysia safely through.  Full\r\n\r\ncredit,  100  marks - I said it then, I  say  it  now\r\n\r\nopenly,  and  I will continue to say it  even  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia. We in the Alliance provided him the  elbow\r\n\r\nroom   during   the  referendum  time   to   perform\r\n\r\nadequately.  The stage was set, the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwas on the stage. We left it uncluttered for him  in\r\n\r\norder to give him plenty of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelbow   room,   and  I  think  the  Prime   Minister\r\n\r\nunderstands what I mean when I say we gave him elbow\r\n\r\nroom. If we had been harassing him on the stage,  if\r\n\r\nwe  had  been elbowing him from the stage, we  would\r\n\r\nnot  have got the 70 per cent votes that we  did  in\r\n\r\nfact  get  in  Singapore. So never  let  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  forget that Malaysia  was  not  a  party\r\n\r\naffair.  It  was  a joint affair by  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  believed in Malaysia.  No  political\r\n\r\nstatement by the P.A.P. Government at this  juncture\r\n\r\non  the threshold of merger saying that the Alliance\r\n\r\nis  against Malaysia will help them out. I am  sorry\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. Government should at this late stage\r\n\r\ntry,  because  of  certain actions which  they  have\r\n\r\ntaken,  which I propose to explain to the House,  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that we are against Malaysia or merger - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Of course, it is true. The radio has\r\n\r\nsaid so; T.V. has said so; the papers are saying so.\r\n\r\nT.V., the radio, the papers belong to the Government -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not the papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> They do, Mr Speaker, Sir, I regret to\r\n\r\nsay. If you turn on the news at any time during  the\r\n\r\nnight  or  morning,  you will hear  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said this and the Prime Minister said that,\r\n\r\nbut  why  did  be say that? It was because  somebody\r\n\r\nmade  a  speech to which the Prime Minister replied.\r\n\r\nBut does the radio report the speech which motivated\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister into making his reply? No. It  is\r\n\r\nforgotten;  that is not reported. But the  whole  of\r\n\r\nthe speech of the Prime Minister is given. The other\r\n\r\nside of the story is not given at all. The means  of\r\n\r\npropaganda is at the disposal of the Government and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it appears that they are going to use  it\r\n\r\nto  hammer  all the other political Parties  out  of\r\n\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what induces the P.A.P. Government to say that we are against Malaysia? What is it? Because last Thursday, when the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance were away, and I think since we are in a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntruthful  mood,  we might as well say  straight  now\r\n\r\nthat without the Prime Minister and the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  the P.A.P. Front Bench is quite  pathetic,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir. They really cannot think properly.\r\n\r\nThey cannot react at all. Because the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  his  able aide, the Minister for Finance,  were\r\n\r\nnot  here,  they got into a complete and utter  mess\r\n\r\nover the Federal Elections Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anybody is responsible for this present impasse,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, over the election of seats to the\r\n\r\nFederal   Parliament,  then   it   is   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. What did we object to in that Bill,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker?  Two  points of objection were  taken.  The\r\n\r\nfirst point was procedural; the second point was one\r\n\r\nof  substance.  The procedural point  was  that  the\r\n\r\npresentation  of  the Bill to the House  was  wrong,\r\n\r\nthat  it should have come after this debate.  To  my\r\n\r\nmind,  that was a valid point. The second point  was\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. Government was going to  draw  the\r\n\r\nwards  in  the way they could, the way they  wanted.\r\n\r\nNaturally, do you think we are going to allow  that?\r\n\r\nWe  are  political Parties. We want political  power\r\n\r\njust  as  much as they do. We are not babes  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical  wood.  We  know  that  if  we  give   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  the power to delineate the  wards,  they\r\n\r\ncould  draw them in such a way that they  would  get\r\n\r\nalmost  all  the  15 seats. It is simple.  Let  them\r\n\r\nallow me to draw the wards, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  I\r\n\r\nwill  draw them in such a way that the Alliance will\r\n\r\nget  the  greatest number of seats. Give it  to  the\r\n\r\nBarisan,  they  will  do it likewise.  Give  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim, and he will do  it  likewise.\r\n\r\nEach of four groups can draw the wards in such a way\r\n\r\nthat  each  group can get a majority of  seats.  The\r\n\r\nfair  thing to do is to put the drawing of the wards\r\n\r\nin  an  impartial  body. The Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nrecognised  this in his statement to the  House.  He\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Yes, on second thoughts I now realise that 5-4  is  not fair; make it 4-4,\" showing that at  last\r\n\r\nthe light was beginning to dawn. The Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim asked, what about the Chairman? The Chairman  is\r\n\r\nimportant. If the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  asked  for  or  if  they had  listened  to  our\r\n\r\nsuggestions, we might have suggested to them to  get\r\n\r\nan  independent Chairman from the Federal  Elections\r\n\r\nCommission in Kuala Lumpur. Let him preside, and  if\r\n\r\nthere is an equality of votes on any issue, give him\r\n\r\na  single casting vote. We would be happy. The  ball\r\n\r\nis now at the Government feet. They can kick it into\r\n\r\nthe  Federal  Elections Bill goal  or  not  as  they\r\n\r\nplease.  So  let  them not blame  the  Alliance  for\r\n\r\nmaking   it  not  possible  for  Singapore   to   be\r\n\r\nrepresented in the Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might I say this to the Government? Let them draw\r\n\r\nthese  election boundaries in a fair and  reasonable\r\n\r\nmanner. Mr Speaker, Sir, you know this business  of\r\n\r\nintroducing Bills, making amendments here, there and\r\n\r\neverywhere piecemeal and getting the Assembly into a\r\n\r\nstate of non-understanding - that is the phrase I  am\r\n\r\nthinking of. Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember the\r\n\r\nSingapore  (Elections  to  the  Federal   House   of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives)  Bill which has now  been  stymied,\r\n\r\nbut which still remains on the statute book with the\r\n\r\noption  to  the  Government to reintroduce  it  with\r\n\r\nsuitable amendments if they want to. So let not  the\r\n\r\nblame lie with the Opposition any more. I hope  that\r\n\r\nresponsible organs which are allowed in the Assembly\r\n\r\nin order that what is said in this Assembly might be\r\n\r\ncarried  out to the public at large do their  public\r\n\r\nduty.  Instead  of suppressing it, omitting  it  and\r\n\r\nsaying  \"Oh,  we forgot. We did not think  that  was\r\n\r\nimportant,\" I am suggesting, Mr Speaker, Sir,  this\r\n\r\nis  absolutely vital. Let nobody misunderstand this.\r\n\r\nYou  will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in  this\r\n\r\nBill,  there is no provision as to how the electoral\r\n\r\nboundaries would have been drawn - a serious omission\r\n\r\nby the drafting side of the State Advocate-General's\r\n\r\nDepartment.   They  bring  in  amendments   to   the\r\n\r\nSchedule.  They set out the Schedule, then  set  out\r\n\r\nthe  amendments that they are going to make  to  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  On the First Reading all the  amendments\r\n\r\nwere  not in. On the Second Reading, amendments were\r\n\r\nbrought in very cleverly to section 8 of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Legislative   Assembly   Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance. Now, section 8 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may from time to time by notification\r\n\r\nin  the Gazette specify the names and boundaries  of\r\n\r\nthe  electoral divisions of the island for  purposes\r\n\r\nof election under this Ordinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Originally,  Mr Speaker, Sir, when  this  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwas  passed, the phrase was \"the Governor  may  from\r\n\r\ntime to time\". You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat elections were first introduced in Singapore in\r\n\r\nthe  colonial days when power was with the  Governor\r\n\r\nwith  his  Legislative Council. Parties there  were.\r\n\r\nBut  the deciding factor, the person who decided the\r\n\r\nelectoral boundaries, was the Governor. In so far as\r\n\r\nParties   were  concerned,  the  Governor  was   not\r\n\r\ninterested. So he played cricket, not golf.  He  did\r\n\r\nnot  hook the hail. He played cricket. And he played\r\n\r\nit  fair according to certain recognised principles.\r\n\r\nThere  are  certain recognised principles  when  one\r\n\r\ndraws  electoral boundaries. I know them. I  sat  on\r\n\r\none of them. Mr Thomson was the Chairman. They know\r\n\r\nMr Thomson. They trust him. I also trust him. He is\r\n\r\na  perfect gentleman. The first thing we did on that\r\n\r\nCommittee  was to agree on the principles  on  which\r\n\r\nthe divisions should be made. All the Parties agreed\r\n\r\nthat  there  should be certain principles applicable\r\n\r\nin the matter of delineation of wards. Having agreed\r\n\r\non  those principles, each of us put our suggestions\r\n\r\nbased on those principles. That is how we did it. In\r\n\r\ncourse of time, complete self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the word \"Governor\" has been changed to\r\n\r\n\"Minister\".  The Minister does not play cricket.  He\r\n\r\ndoes  not  play any game at all. But  he  plays  the\r\n\r\nparty  game.  So what is the Minister going  to  do?\r\n\r\n\"The  Minister may from time to time by notification\r\n\r\nin  the Gazette specify the names and boundaries  of\r\n\r\nthe  electoral divisions of the Island for  purposes\r\n\r\nof   elections  to  the  Federal  Parliament.\"   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, he is not in this to do us justice  as\r\n\r\nwe  think it should be done. I would not blame  him,\r\n\r\nif  he  drew it the way he wanted to; of  course,  I\r\n\r\nwould not. If we were fools enough to give him  that\r\n\r\nstatutory power,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy  should  he  not use it?

We were sufficiently -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The point k that we want to\r\n\r\nmake  our position quite clear, because the position\r\n\r\nwe  are  going to take today - I hope the  Government\r\n\r\nare  not going to use their mass media of propaganda\r\n\r\nto distort the stand we are going to take - is what we\r\n\r\nthink is in the best interests of Singapore, in  our\r\n\r\nview.  They  might not agree. The Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nmight  not agree. The Barisan might not agree.  But,\r\n\r\nin  our  view,  the stand we are going  to  take  is\r\n\r\ncompletely fair and completely just now,  today  and\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Sir, when\r\n\r\nthis Assembly debated the White Paper we were behind\r\n\r\nthe  Government. We voted with them. And  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper after the resolution of the Assembly was their\r\n\r\nmandate  for Malaysia. Anything outside that mandate\r\n\r\nwas  not within the competence of the Hon, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and his able Finance Minister to talk about\r\n\r\nin  London.  Even if they did talk  about  it,  they\r\n\r\nshould  have come back to us for approval  and  then\r\n\r\nhad  them  embodied in the Constitution.  The  whole\r\n\r\npresentation  of  these papers in  the  debate,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I must say, has been pathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Absolutely pathetic.

I\r\n\r\nmight  say,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that  the  procedure\r\n\r\nadopted for the presentation of these papers in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, I think, has been determined by this - that\r\n\r\nthey did not want us to read the documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Documents after documents came to us on\r\n\r\nthe last day, Mr Speaker, and amendments on top  of\r\n\r\namendments. Imagine our predicament. There are  some\r\n\r\nmore  to  come, I am told. The whole story  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  told  yet. And we are asked to  consider  this\r\n\r\nrationally and give a fair and reasonable  appraisal\r\n\r\nof  the  situation in such a manner that we can  all\r\n\r\ncome to some reasonable conclusion on this. What  is\r\n\r\nthis  game  the  Government are  playing?  Are  they\r\n\r\npushing  us into something which they think  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to go in without our knowledge? I think I have\r\n\r\nspotted  some  defects. But I do not  claim  I  have\r\n\r\nspotted  them  all. Maybe the Member for  Anson  may\r\n\r\nhave spotted some which I have not. I hope tile rest\r\n\r\nwill bring up these things before the House. But  as\r\n\r\nI  see  the  Government's motion,  there  are  three\r\n\r\naspects to the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first aspect is the White Paper. The second\r\n\r\naspect  is  the loan agreement. The third aspect  is\r\n\r\nthe  common market. And there is a fourth aspect  to\r\n\r\nit,  which  is  neither  here  nor  there,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had hoped that we would not see  it.  We\r\n\r\nhave  seen  some  of it - some of us who  have  spent\r\n\r\nsleepless nights, and I am quite groggy on my  feet.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have  seen some of it. But whether  we  are\r\n\r\nsufficiently  compos mentis to make  our  points  as\r\n\r\nlogically  and  as coherently as we might  otherwise\r\n\r\nhave done is a matter for history to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the White Paper, as I have indicated, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   a  complete  mandate   from   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly. I congratulate the  Government\r\n\r\non carrying it through very efficiently. On the loan\r\n\r\nagreement,  there  was  no mandate.  On  the  common\r\n\r\nmarket  there was no mandate. But I will not pretend\r\n\r\nthat I was not unaware of what Government was doing.\r\n\r\nI  will not pretend. I approve of some of the things\r\n\r\nwhich  they said and did. I think some of the things\r\n\r\nwhich  they  finally did are wrong. But  it  may  be\r\n\r\npurely  a  matter of personal opinion. They  may  be\r\n\r\nright,  but  my  personal opinion is that  the  loan\r\n\r\nagreement  was  wrong. That is my personal  opinion.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  that the ten years that are to come from today\r\n\r\nare  the vital years for Singapore. He is right.  If\r\n\r\nwe  survive the next five to ten years, we will have\r\n\r\nturned the corner into an era of stability. But  the\r\n\r\nfirst ten years is an unstable period, and the  boat\r\n\r\nis  likely  to rock any minute. Somebody could  rock\r\n\r\nit.  And, therefore, the State must be in a position\r\n\r\nto  maintain  the  boat  on an  even  keel.  My  own\r\n\r\npersonal  view  is, give an outright  grant  of  $25\r\n\r\nmillion maybe, but do not permit $150 million of the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  money  to  go  out  in  loans.  We   are\r\n\r\ncommitting the money over a period of 10 years to 15\r\n\r\nyears.  I am not grudging the loan, because  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  any  money lent to Borneo, any  benefit  which\r\n\r\nthey  get,  Singapore  must  inevitably  benefit.  I\r\n\r\nsurely appreciate that. But while benefiting others,\r\n\r\nI  think we should benefit ourselves first. I really\r\n\r\nbelieve that if the $100 million or the $125 million\r\n\r\nof   that  money  which  is  being  loaned  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation  for  Borneo had been kept  with  us,  it\r\n\r\ncould  have  been utilised for social  services.  It\r\n\r\ncould have been utilised for a number of good things\r\n\r\nwhich  the people in Singapore should have. And  the\r\n\r\nmore  they  have, the less liable  they  are  to  be\r\n\r\nagitated  by the friends of the Prime Minister  whom\r\n\r\nhe  calls  the manipulators of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\nThat is the only point, Mr Speaker. I do not grudge\r\n\r\nBorneo   the   money.  Good  luck  to  them.   Their\r\n\r\nprosperity must inevitably be ours. The Federation's\r\n\r\nprosperity  must inevitably be ours,  and  we  would\r\n\r\nlike to be in between two areas of prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not competent to speak on the common market. The Prime Minister has said that his able Finance Minister will explain the whole position to the House. He has not yet done so. No doubt when he does so, there will be other Members on my side of the House who will deal with the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to deal particularly with the constitutional\r\n\r\naspect  of  the  merger agreement and the  documents\r\n\r\nthat have now been put before us. You will remember,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I said that there was  a  fourth\r\n\r\naspect to these documents. There were deletions here\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere, amendments here and there; and everything was\r\n\r\ncrowded  on  to us within 24 hours, perhaps  in  the\r\n\r\nhope  and  expectation  that  we  might  not  notice\r\n\r\nmaterial changes. But I propose to bring up some  of\r\n\r\nthe matters I have noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point I wish to deal with is Article 69.\r\n\r\nIf I may refer to Paper Cmd. 22 of 1963, Article 69,\r\n\r\npage  47. This is a matter which deals with  a  Bill\r\n\r\nintituled  \"An Act for Malaysia\", and this  will  be\r\n\r\npassed by the Federal Parliament. Article 69 of that\r\n\r\nBill  affects  Singapore. With your permission,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  might  I  read it - at least  the  relevant\r\n\r\nportions of it? Article 69:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) No amendment shall be made to the Constitution\r\n\r\nwithout the concurrence of the Governor [the Goveror\r\n\r\nhere is the Yang di-Pertuan Negara] if the amendment\r\n\r\nis   such  as  to  affect  the  operation   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution in relation to Singapore as regards any\r\n\r\nof the following matters -'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, constitutionally, in my mind, it means this: No\r\n\r\namendment shall be made to the Constitution  without\r\n\r\nthe  concurrence of the Government of  Singapore  if\r\n\r\nthe amendment is such as to affect the operation  of\r\n\r\nthe Constitution in relation to Singapore as regards\r\n\r\nany of the following matters:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) citizenship of Singapore...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the constitution and jurisdiction of the High\r\n\r\nCourt in Singapore and the appointment, removal and\r\n\r\nsuspension of judges of that court;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the matters with respect to which the\r\n\r\nLegislature  of  the  State  may  make  laws,   the\r\n\r\nexecutive authority of the State in those  matters,\r\n\r\nthe borrowing powers of the State and the financial\r\n\r\narrangements between the Federation and the State;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the discharge of functions of the Public\r\n\r\nServices  Commission or of the Judicial  and  Legal\r\n\r\nService Commission by a branch established for  the\r\n\r\nState, and the constitution of any such branch;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) religion in the State [which the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  touched on yesterday],  the  use  in  the\r\n\r\nState  or  in  Parliament of any language  and  the\r\n\r\nspecial position of the Malays in Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) the allocation to the State, in any\r\n\r\nParliament  summoned  to meet  before  the  end  of\r\n\r\nAugust, 1970, of a quota of members of the House of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives  not  less, in  proportion  to  the\r\n\r\ntotal allocated to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   other  States  which  are  members  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   on  Malaysia  Day,  than   the   quota\r\n\r\nallocated to the State on that day.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  juxtaposition to that Article, Sir, may I  refer\r\n\r\nyou  to  page 161 of the same Command Paper - Article\r\n\r\n90  of  our Constitution, because they both tie  up.\r\n\r\nArticle 69 is the Federal angle; let us now get  the\r\n\r\nSingapore angle. Article 90 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Subject to the provisions of the Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution and to the following provisions of this\r\n\r\nArticle, the provisions of this Constitution may  be\r\n\r\namended by a law enacted by the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A Bill for making an amendment to this\r\n\r\nConstitution (other than an amendment excepted  from\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this clause) shall not be  passed\r\n\r\nby  the  Legislative  Assembly unless  it  has  been\r\n\r\nsupported on Second and Third Readings by the  votes\r\n\r\nof  not less than two-thirds of the total number  of\r\n\r\nmembers thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The following amendments are excepted from the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clause (2)  of this Article, that is to\r\n\r\nsay -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any amendment consequential on such a\r\n\r\nlaw  as  is  mentioned in Article  23  of  this\r\n\r\nConstitution;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any amendment the effect of which is to\r\n\r\nbring  the  Constitution  of  the  State   into\r\n\r\naccord  with  any  of the essential  provisions\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the  Eighth  Schedule   to   the\r\n\r\nFederal Constitution.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, you will notice that by virtue  of the  provisions of Article 90, any Second and  Third Readings on matters affecting the Constitution  must be by votes of not less than two-thirds of the total number  of members of the Legislature. Correct.  Now may I read Article 90 (1)  again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of the Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution and to the following provisions of this\r\n\r\nArticle, ..'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The operative words in this Article, to my mind, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, are \"Subject to the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Constitution\".  Let  us  get  back  to  the\r\n\r\nFederal   Constitution.  What   does   the   Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution say? It says this - I am paraphrasing it\r\n\r\n- there  is  a procedure prescribed for amendment  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federal Parliament. It must not be less than  a\r\n\r\ncertain  number  of votes, as we  will  have  it  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So  the  amendments are  passed  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal Parliament according to the minimum number\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  votes required, affecting our Constitution.  The\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament  passes it by  two-thirds;  they\r\n\r\nhave  the  decency  to do that. But  what  does  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  do? What does our Prime Minister  commit\r\n\r\nus  to  by  the  back-door  method?  He  says,  \"The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  agree to it; the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  will agree to it; the Cabinet will agree  to\r\n\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I may be wrong, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I\r\n\r\nwould  be  happier  if  Article  69  (1)   read,  \"No\r\n\r\namendment shall be made to the Constitution  without\r\n\r\nthe  concurrence of two-thirds of the votes  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly of Singapore.\". I would then be\r\n\r\na much happier man, and I would sleep much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is what it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, let us have it in black and white!\r\n\r\nLet  us  not quibble about it in the Courts. Let  us\r\n\r\nhave  it  in  a language that we all can understand.\r\n\r\nYou talk about the Governor. If you were to read  it\r\n\r\nagain,  you might think one single man could do  it.\r\n\r\nThen in order to find out who the \"Governor\" is, you\r\n\r\nhave to go to some interpreting section. And then we\r\n\r\nfind  that  the \"Governor\" means the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara.   And  then  you  get  to  know   from   the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  experts that  the  \"Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara\" in the Constitution means the Cabinet. Now I\r\n\r\nam told by the Front Benchers that the Cabinet means\r\n\r\nthe   Legislative  Assembly.  I  am  puzzled;  quite\r\n\r\nfrankly  I  am,  when  the  Cabinet  can  mean   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly. That really beats me. Let  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  prove that the Cabinet equates  to  two-thirds  of the Legislative Assembly, and I am happy.\r\n\r\nBut until they can show it to me and to the Assembly\r\n\r\nthat  the  Cabinet does not equate to two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly - not a majority vote; we do not want  a\r\n\r\nmajority  vote. We might have a 26/25 Assembly  here\r\n\r\nand  the  Government could put it through a 26-vote;\r\n\r\nno,  we  do  not  want that. We  want  a  two-thirds\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  Legislative Assembly.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has quite rightly fought for certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings to be put into the Constitution. He has said,\r\n\r\n\"I  want  the  Common Market terms embodied  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\"  I  agree  with  him  completely  and\r\n\r\nutterly.  I am behind him because that is  our  only\r\n\r\nprotection. Once we have it in the Constitution, the\r\n\r\nFederal Parliament Cabinet cannot alter it. We  must\r\n\r\nhave  protection,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  This  is  no\r\n\r\nprotection  to us. We will end up with  the  Federal\r\n\r\nCabinet   taking   away   all   our   constitutional\r\n\r\nsafeguards  and well be left naked,  high  and  dry.\r\n\r\nThat is the first point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is Article 30 (2) (b) of Paper\r\n\r\nCmd.  22,  at page 144 - Tenure of office of Members.\r\n\r\nIf I may read it, Mr Speaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Every Member of the Legislative Assembly shall\r\n\r\ncease to be a Member at the next dissolution of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly after he has been elected,  or\r\n\r\npreviously thereto if his seat becomes vacant, under\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The seat of a Member of the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly shall become vacant - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if he ceases to be a citizen of Singapore; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if he ceases to be a member of or is expelled\r\n\r\nor  resigns from the political party for which\r\n\r\nhe stood in the election; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if, by writing under his hand ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  rest of the provision, Mr Speaker, Sir, is  as\r\n\r\nit  is in our present Order in Council. Now, I am  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  a  political Party.  I  think  political\r\n\r\nParties  have  places in society,  especially  in  a\r\n\r\nsociety  which believes in parliamentary  democracy.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do not think that a political Party has  any\r\n\r\nplace in the constitution of any country. No.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot believe it. It may be - if the Prime Minister  or\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Finance  can  say   - that   the\r\n\r\nconstitution of some country has embodied the rights\r\n\r\nof  political Parties in the Constitution.

I do  not  have  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General to advise me. Even if I'  ring  him\r\n\r\nup  for  information,  I do not  get  it.  You  will\r\n\r\nrecollect that the Prime Minister made an open offer\r\n\r\nto  Members of the Opposition that if they  were  in\r\n\r\ndoubt  they could approach his Ministry or the State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General.  I  availed myself  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's offer, and I rang up the State  Advocate-General's Chambers and I spoke to him. E said, \"I am\r\n\r\nin difficulties, Mr State Advocate-General. Can you\r\n\r\nhelp  me?\"  He  said, \"Certainly.\" A most  courteous\r\n\r\ngentleman. \"Certainly,\" he said. And I said,  \"Look,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister has indicated  that  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper as published in England and the White Paper as\r\n\r\npublished  here differ. He has also  said  that  the\r\n\r\ndifference  occurs  (1)   at  the  instance  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government, and (2)  at the instance of the\r\n\r\nFederation Government. So could you please  indicate\r\n\r\nto  me  where  the  differences lie  and  could  you\r\n\r\nseparate  the differences under the two  appropriate\r\n\r\nheads'?\" I told him that otherwise I would  have  to\r\n\r\nspend  hours  and hours comparing our document  with\r\n\r\nthe  English document. Each document runs  to  about\r\n\r\n210  pages.  It  is  no joke.  I  do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  private secretaries  or  able  civil\r\n\r\nservants.

Whether it has received Her Majesty\r\n\r\nthe  Queen's Assent, I am not in a position to  say,\r\n\r\nbut  I would think that once it receives Her Majesty\r\n\r\nthe  Queen's Assent, then the Annexure and the  Bill\r\n\r\nitself  become  a statute and no provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nstatute  nor  any  part or portion of  the  Annexure\r\n\r\ncould  be altered without the consent of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThen  the constitutional position would be that  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty  the  Queen  would  formulate  an  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil  which  would  then become,  [take  it,  our\r\n\r\nConstitution.  Now the Government has  presented  us\r\n\r\nwith  Cmd.  22  of 1963 which diverges certainly  to\r\n\r\nthis extent in clause 30 (2)  (b)  which is not in the\r\n\r\nEnglish counterpart. I want a categorical reply from\r\n\r\nthe Government on this, assuming they get a vote  on\r\n\r\nthis  section, as to what is the constitutional  and\r\n\r\nlegal position. Would this supersede the Annexure to\r\n\r\nthe  British  Act which would become  the  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil,  or would Parliament have to reconvene  and\r\n\r\npass the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill all over again with a different Annexure, or is\r\n\r\nthe  Queen  competent constitutionally  of  her  own\r\n\r\naccord  and volition to alter the Annexure  to  suit\r\n\r\nthe private wish of our Prime Minister and his party\r\n\r\ncolleagues, because he is afraid that one or two  of\r\n\r\nhis Back benchers might cross over. I am not looking\r\n\r\nin  any  particular direction, Mr Speaker,  Sir,I\r\n\r\njust  happened to look that way. [Laughter]  Is  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister afraid that one or two  might  cross\r\n\r\nover  and he might lose his majority? It could  well\r\n\r\nbe  that  it  is not so, but it does look  like  it,\r\n\r\nbecause he is in fact with this problem very much on\r\n\r\nhis  lap; does he think that this is the way out for\r\n\r\nhim?  I  respectfully suggest to him that it  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  embodied  in the Constitution.  Perhaps  it\r\n\r\nmight be embodied in a local Act. That will be  just\r\n\r\nbetween them and us for the moment. But to embody it\r\n\r\nin  the Constitution of Singapore, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nis to embody it for the present and the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may read that paragraph\r\n\r\n(b)  again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If he ceases to be a member of or is expelled or\r\n\r\nresigns from the political party for which he  stood\r\n\r\nin the election;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope you will forgive me for referring to myself. I am possibly the only Member in this Assembly whom this section will not catch. It will not catch me at all, because I contested the elections as an Independent and if I subsequently join a Party as in fact I have and resign from it,\r\n\r\nthis section does not affect me. So you will forgive\r\n\r\nme  for suggesting to you that my speech on this can\r\n\r\nbe  completely  objective - no personal  motives,  no\r\n\r\npersonal  interests; I think I should be  given  the\r\n\r\nweight that should be given to an objective point of\r\n\r\nview,  and in this particular matter I am  the  only\r\n\r\nperson  in  this august Assembly who  could  express\r\n\r\nthat  objective  view, because  there  is  no  other\r\n\r\nMember  in  this  House  who  was  returned  as   an\r\n\r\nIndependent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, could I refer you to page 165 of\r\n\r\nthe  same  Command  Paper?

You  see,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, after Malaysia Day, the Constitution  comes\r\n\r\ninto  operation. After Malaysia Day,  this  Assembly\r\n\r\ncannot sit without taking the oath under section  96\r\n\r\n(2) .  Before  the oath is taken, you  will  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether the Members here  are  sitting  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the provisions of this Constitution.\r\n\r\nIf  any  of  them  have violated the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nsection  30 (2) , then, Mr Speaker, you will  either\r\n\r\nhave  to make up your own mind on this very delicate\r\n\r\nmatter, or you will have to get advice from possibly\r\n\r\nthe State Advocate-General, and do the best you can.\r\n\r\nBut  it could be that the factual position resulting\r\n\r\nfrom  the 1st of September could be this. If  I  may\r\n\r\ndeal  with the Members on my left first. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Joo Chiat - now an Independent - returned to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  as a Singapore People's Alliance candidate\r\n\r\nand  he will find that he is not sitting within  the\r\n\r\nambit of this Constitution and therefore -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Member:</b> One year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> What I feel is this. That we should have\r\n\r\nthese  things written down in such a way that we  do\r\n\r\nnot  give people sleepless nights thinking over what\r\n\r\nthey  should  do and should not do. In other  words,\r\n\r\ndiscretion. Too much discretion should not be  given\r\n\r\nto  the Government. You see how much time they waste\r\n\r\nthinking over whether they should have a by-election\r\n\r\nin  Sembawang, whether it should be five  days  from\r\n\r\ntoday,  or  whether  it  should  be  six  days  from\r\n\r\ntomorrow. You see how much time and trouble we  will\r\n\r\nsave  the  Government if we put in an  amendment  to\r\n\r\nArticle 33 - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the casual vacancy shall be filled within\r\n\r\nsixty days of such occurrence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The   law  then  would  take  its  course.  And  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would not have to make these very,  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  decisions. I do accept it. If I  were  in\r\n\r\nthe Government's position, I might be doing the same\r\n\r\nthing.  But there is no reason why when I am in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition I should not see that the right thing  is\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Yet  when  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister made his speech, I think, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfairness  to  the Opposition - now I understand,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  why  I  have not  been  given  these\r\n\r\ndifferences. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have told you  that\r\n\r\nI   had  requested  the  S.A.G. to  give  me  these\r\n\r\ndifferences. I can now understand why I had not been\r\n\r\ngiven  them. If the list had come to me  this  would\r\n\r\nhave been pinpointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the British Parliament, the Agreement between\r\n\r\nour  Government, the Federation Government  and  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government was clause 33 - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever the seat of a Member has become vacant\r\n\r\nfor any reason other than a dissolution, the vacancy\r\n\r\nshall within three months from the date on which  it\r\n\r\nis  established that there is a vacancy,  be  filled      \r\n\r\n...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What do we have in our Constitution?

We believe\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia.  We fought for it with the  Government\r\n\r\nside  by side; if the Prime Minister does not object\r\n\r\nto  the  continuation  of the  simile,  shoulder  to\r\n\r\nshoulder. And we, who have been fighting with him on\r\n\r\nthis   matter  on  a  national  basis,   have   been\r\n\r\nunwittingly led along.

As  the  Member  for  Farrer  Park  has\r\n\r\nindicated  that he, at the appropriate moment,  will\r\n\r\nwish  to  move a further amendment, therefore,  this\r\n\r\ndebate could range over this further amendment which\r\n\r\nhe  says  he will propose at the appropriate moment.\r\n\r\nHe  cannot  do so now because there is  already  one\r\n\r\namendment  before the House.

Sir, there  is\r\n\r\nno  question, so far as the Alliance is concerned of\r\n\r\nthe S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. The Government are trying to\r\n\r\ndivide  us.  They  keep  on  attacking  the  S.P.A.,\r\n\r\nleaving  the U.M.N.O. out. For their edification,  I\r\n\r\nmight  say that the Member for Cairnhill, who is  an\r\n\r\nAlliance member, is the leader of the Alliance,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  the Southern Islands,  who  is  an\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. Member, is the Whip of the Party.  And  any\r\n\r\naction   taken  by  the  Alliance  is  after   joint\r\n\r\nconsultation. We are in this together. There  is  no\r\n\r\ndivergence  of views. So let not the Government  try\r\n\r\nand  split us. It is quite unworthy of them. It will\r\n\r\nnot get them anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all I wish to say is this. We are for\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I  ask  the Government  not  to  make  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for us to vote with them on this  motion.\r\n\r\nWhile  we are for Malaysia, we are even more so  for\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is because we love Singapore  so  much\r\n\r\nthat  we  go  into Malaysia. Now, if in  going  into\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  some  jiggery-pokery  is  going   to   be\r\n\r\nperpetrated  against  Singapore,  to  preserve  some\r\n\r\nparty  interests, we are not going to be a party  to\r\n\r\nthat.  We cannot and we must not. The Alliance makes\r\n\r\nthis  offer  that if they support this amendment  we\r\n\r\nwill  whole-heartedly and with great  pleasure  vote\r\n\r\nwith  them on the motion, but if they deny  us  this\r\n\r\nand  defeat  us on this amendment, it  is  with  the\r\n\r\nutmost  regret  that we will have  to  refrain  from\r\n\r\nvoting  on  a  matter on which  we  are  so  vitally\r\n\r\nconcerned and connected. I hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nnot force us into that position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement  is  a sell-out  by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nminority  Government.

Both sell-outs happened more or less in  the\r\n\r\nsame circumstances, and in the same predicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the principle of Malaysia, which is a\r\n\r\nmerger of the five territories of Malaya, Singapore,\r\n\r\nSabah, Sarawak and Brunei - a genuine merger of these\r\n\r\nterritories on fair and equal terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is bad luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> But the Malaysia Agreement signed\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. minority Government in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom   with   the  British  and  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernments  is not in concord with the  concept  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Singapore is relegated to a vassal  State\r\n\r\nwith  many  obligations  and  liabilities  and  with\r\n\r\nlittle  rights. Singapore is a step-brother in  this\r\n\r\nso-called family. Our rights have been sold by  this\r\n\r\nP.A.P. minority Government down the gutter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 24th January, 1962, I said in this Assembly that we support the concept of Malaysia which will provide a bigger single political and economic unit for the benefit of the ten million inhabitants of this country, giving us wider opportunities for both political and economic\r\n\r\nadvancement.  But, as I said in my  speech  on  24th\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1962,  the  P.A.P. White  Paper  proposals\r\n\r\ncould not provide us with the opportunities for both\r\n\r\npolitical and economic advancement for the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be two types of citizenship, one for the\r\n\r\nrest  of Malaysia, and the other, an inferior status\r\n\r\nof  Malaysian  citizenship, for us,  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There will be restrictions  of  movement\r\n\r\nwithin  the new Federation of Malaysia so  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  cannot  exercise  their  full\r\n\r\nrights  as  citizens  of  Malaysia.  The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are relegated to an inferior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclass  of  Malaysian citizenship anti  their  rights\r\n\r\nwill  be  suppressed. This is not  the  Malaysia  we\r\n\r\nwant.  The present scheme is to suppress the  rights\r\n\r\nof  the  people  of  Singapore.  Our  stand  on  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  issue  is  most constant  and  has  never\r\n\r\nwavered, not even once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malaysia Agreement, which is a direct\r\n\r\ndeparture from the Malaysia concept, and endorsed by\r\n\r\nthe minority Government of the P.A.P., is an act  of\r\n\r\ntreachery   perpetrated  against   the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The P.A.P. Government are so ashamed  of\r\n\r\nthis,  and that is why Opposition Members are  given\r\n\r\nall  these voluminous constitutional documents  only\r\n\r\nat the last minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Malaysia Agreement containing 232 pages was given to me on Sunday afternoon. This is the document which will decide the destiny of 1.8 million people of Singapore, and also our children to come. This document is the most vital document ever produced in the State to decide\r\n\r\nthe  fate and the destiny of 1 .8 million people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and their future generations.  It  dwarfs\r\n\r\nthe  importance of the Rendel Constitution  and  the 1958   Singapore  Constitution,  because  in   those\r\n\r\nConstitutions  we were only provided with  temporary\r\n\r\nGovernments   for  fleeting  phases  in  Singapore's\r\n\r\nhistory,  at  the most for four to five  years,  and\r\n\r\ndespite  that,  with  those two  Constitutions,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and the people were afforded ample  time\r\n\r\nand  opportunities to put forward  their  views  and\r\n\r\ndiscuss   the   merits   or   demerits   of    those\r\n\r\nConstitutions. But with the Malaysia  Agreement  and\r\n\r\nthe  new State Constitution of Singapore under  this\r\n\r\nso-called Malaysia, documents which will decide  our\r\n\r\ndestiny for many hundreds of years to come,  let  me\r\n\r\nask  the  Government, how many people  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  read  these vital documents?  In  my  opinion,\r\n\r\nthere are not more than 20 or 30 people in Singapore\r\n\r\nwho  have  read  these vital documents.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  dare  not  even translate  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement into the vernacular languages and  publish\r\n\r\nit  in  the  Press.  Whereas  in  the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial    negotiations   with   the    Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, special long explanatory articles were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwritten  by the Government and even translations  of\r\n\r\ncertain  documents on the financial agreements  were\r\n\r\nmade  and  published in the Press.  Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will give us the excuse that there is not\r\n\r\nenough time to translate the Malaysia Agreement into\r\n\r\nthe various vernacular languages for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, shall we just pass this document which\r\n\r\ndwarfs  all the sell-out treaties signed by  Chinese\r\n\r\nmilitary  war lords to imperialist powers when  only\r\n\r\nat  the most 20 or 30 people in Singapore have  read\r\n\r\nthem?  Why is the Government so scared? Why has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  given  us so little time  to  study  the\r\n\r\ndocuments, to debate them, giving us only three days\r\n\r\nto   debate   - documents  which  would  decide   our\r\n\r\ndestinies  for  hundreds of years!  Giving  us  only\r\n\r\nthree days to debate and to inform the people.  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  this not a sell-out? Is this not a genuine sell-out? And that is why they are so scared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must strongly protest against the manner in which the P.A.P. Government is treating the Opposition and the people. They are afraid that the people will know what goes on.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 234-page Malaysia Agreement, that is, the Blue\r\n\r\nBook, could be bought in the United Kingdom from the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government Printing Office about two  weeks\r\n\r\nago  for about $6 per copy, and some Members of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition managed to obtain several copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the P.A.P. Government said that the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement published by the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which  is the Blue  Book,  is  somewhat\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the Malaysia Agreement presented  to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Legislative Assembly,  which  is  the\r\n\r\nWhite Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government is going to  present  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation Parliament next month when they are going\r\n\r\nto  debate  also the Malaysia Agreement.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthey use the Brown Book. Now the British passed  the\r\n\r\nBlue Book, which is different from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  White  Book  passed by the Singapore  Assembly,\r\n\r\nwhich  might be different from the Brown Book passed\r\n\r\nby  the Federation Parliament. Mr Speaker, Sir, how\r\n\r\nare  we going to run this country? Which book is the\r\n\r\nright  interpretation of what  has  been  sold  out?\r\n\r\nWould the P.A.P. tell us the whole truth? What  have\r\n\r\nthey  sold out? How much have they sold us out?  Why\r\n\r\nshould  we  have so many versions of what they  have\r\n\r\nsigned in England?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to seek clarification from the Government on\r\n\r\nwhich is the genuine Malaysia Agreement. Why do they\r\n\r\nnot  produce  to us photostat copies of the  genuine\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement  to which this  minority  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment have attested their signatures?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember after the P.A.P. special conference\r\n\r\nof  19th  June,  1960, when I was  expelled,  though\r\n\r\nthere  was  not  such an item to  expel  me  on  the\r\n\r\nagenda,  the  P.A.P. leadership produced  different\r\n\r\nversions  of  the minutes of party proceedings,  one\r\n\r\nversion  for  the English press and another  version\r\n\r\nfor   the  Chinese  press.  Different  versions   of\r\n\r\nproceedings  of one meeting. Now we  have  the  same\r\n\r\nsituation - different versions of what was  sold  out\r\n\r\nin the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit, Sir, it is very difficult for us to\r\n\r\ntrust the P.A.P. leadership. We never know for  sure\r\n\r\nto  what extent this minority P.A.P. Government  has\r\n\r\nsold  out  Singapore. I wish to ask  the  Government\r\n\r\nthis  question.  Has  the Government  given  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition   all   available  documents   concerning\r\n\r\nSingapore's constitutional future, or are these only\r\n\r\npart  of the documents? Are there any more documents\r\n\r\nrelevant  to the constitutional future of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich the P.A.P. Government has sought to hide  from\r\n\r\nus?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish the Government will clarify the matter later.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minority P.A.P. Government must make available to the Opposition Members all the minutes and all the documents of their negotiations from 1961 onwards; then we will\r\n\r\nknow exactly the extent of P.A.P. treachery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the papers on the financial\r\n\r\nnegotiations as contained in Misc. 4 of 1963 contain\r\n\r\nonly 77 pages. I am sure there must be thousands  of\r\n\r\npages  of  documents concerning just  the  financial\r\n\r\ntalks  alone. Why not give us the documents and  all\r\n\r\nthe  facts  so that we can gauge the extent  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. sell-out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have a feeling there are many things the P.A.P. Government is trying to hide from us and from the people. In order to conceal all its sins of betrayal and treachery, this minority P.A.P. Government produces photostat copies on scraps of paper, things written on the back of used envelopes, and telling us they are vital constitutional\r\n\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, how can a constitutional document be written and endorsed at the back - with scribbled notes - of a used envelope, and produced as a part of the White Paper for debate in this Assembly? Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer to the notes scribbled by\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Prime Minister at the Ritz Hotel  on\r\n\r\n8th  July, 1963. I am not sure whether it is the 8th\r\n\r\nJuly,  1963, or the 7th July, 1963. There  were  two\r\n\r\ndates  there. It could be either 12 midnight of  7th\r\n\r\nJuly or 12.01 on 8th July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe they were only points of discussion\r\n\r\nwhich the Federation Prime Minister scribbled on the\r\n\r\nback of a used envelope which he happened to pick up\r\n\r\nat  his  desk.  Is  that proof that  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  agreed to all the  five  points  of\r\n\r\ndiscussion scribbled on the back of a used envelope?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words scribbled on the used envelope are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) \"Loans, labourers - not outside Malaysia - 50 per\r\n\r\ncent  Singapore.\" Mr Speaker, Sir, what  does  that\r\n\r\nmean to us? \"Labourers - not outside Malaysia - 50 per\r\n\r\ncent Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) \"Singapore L. Assemblymen - resignation or\r\n\r\nexpulsion - vacate seat - so long as does not conflict\r\n\r\nparliamentary practice.\" Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  is\r\n\r\nmore understandable although it is like a Morse Code\r\n\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) \"Singapore Immigration and restriction order\r\n\r\nmovement.  Reciprocal.\" Reciprocal might  have  many\r\n\r\nmeanings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) \"Singapore gangster.\" I could not read the\r\n\r\nwords.  It  looks  like O.S.K., a Japanese  shipping\r\n\r\nline.  \"Singapore gangster 0.5K. Detention  delegate\r\n\r\nto us in Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, this is the best joke of this\r\n\r\n\"vital constitutional document.\" \"Detention delegate\r\n\r\nto   us  in  Singapore.\"  This  is  signed  by   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime  Minister.  In  other  words,  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime Minister delegates  the  power  of\r\n\r\ndetention  to  the  Federation  Prime  Minister   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. \"To us in Singapore\" - that is what he has\r\n\r\nsaid. It does not say that detention delegate to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  in Singapore - to  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the last point, Sir, is: \"Singapore last part\r\n\r\nout  - inter-government  committee.\"  This  makes  no\r\n\r\nsense to me at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to mock all this P.A.P. propaganda, we have in\r\n\r\ntoday's  papers, that is, 31st July, the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment's straight denial that they  have  agreed\r\n\r\nto these five points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to refer to page 9 of one\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese newspapers, the Nanyang  Siang Pau. \r\n\r\nThe Federation Government have come out with  a denial that\r\n\r\nthey have agreed to any of these points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think having sold away Singapore in\r\n\r\nLondon  the Singapore Prime Minister became panicky.\r\n\r\nHe must have a guilty conscience. Before he departed\r\n\r\nfor  London, he talked big. He tried to play up  the\r\n\r\n$50 million grant issue - to cover up the purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe  trip which was to sign away Singapore. That was\r\n\r\nthe genuine and the only purpose of the trip. So  in\r\n\r\norder  to  cover  it up be used all the  weapons  of\r\n\r\npropaganda  at  his disposal and  told  us.  \"Fellow\r\n\r\ncountrymen. I am not the Sultan of Singapore;  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  going  to give away $50 million.\"  But  he  was\r\n\r\ngoing  there  quietly to sign away  Singapore  lock,\r\n\r\nstock  and barrel. Sir, he gave away $50 million  in\r\n\r\nanother form - in the form of interest-free loans for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10 years - five years in the first instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to Singapore he knew the big guns\r\n\r\nof the Opposition would be waiting for him. Being  a\r\n\r\nvery  shrewd politician, he tried to catch the  bull\r\n\r\nby  the  horns.  He  organised a  so-called  victory\r\n\r\ncelebration to cover up his sell-out and his  defeat\r\n\r\nin  London. The crowd in the City Hall steps and  in\r\n\r\nHong  Lim Park attracted by the concerts turned away\r\n\r\nwhen the Prime Minister began to speak. On the first\r\n\r\nnight  the  T.V. cameraman must have got a  scolding\r\n\r\nfor  turning his T.V. lenses on the dispersing crowd\r\n\r\nas  the returned hero spoke. On the second night  in\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  Park the T.V. cameraman must have  learnt\r\n\r\nhis  lesson. The Work Brigade boys in front were  so\r\n\r\nembarrassed as the T.V. lenses had only their  faces\r\n\r\nto focus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister and the P.A.P. leadership\r\n\r\nsaw  it. The ground was cold. Nobody echoed  to  the\r\n\r\nshouts  of  Merdeka despite the fact that the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  tried to explain. The P.A.P. leaders  knew\r\n\r\nthey  were finished. They pinned their last hope  on\r\n\r\nthe  undemocratic  Federal  Elections  Bill  through\r\n\r\nwhich they hoped they could rig the elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. leadership had a feeling in London that things were not going too well. They have deceived the Chinese-speaking people in Singapore into believing that Singapore is going to have financial autonomy. Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, the Prime Minister has never mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  words  \"financial autonomy\" when  he  made  his\r\n\r\nspeeches  in English, but when he made his  speeches\r\n\r\nin  Mandarin  or  in  Hokkien,  he  used  the  words\r\n\r\n\"financial autonomy\" for Singapore. But I feel, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  they made a grave tactical mistake in  playing\r\n\r\nup  the  financial talks. They thought it  was  good\r\n\r\npropaganda,  hoping  to  deceive  the  people   that\r\n\r\nalthough  they  had endorsed the  White  Paper  they\r\n\r\nstill  had   the interests of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nat  heart - always defending their rights against the\r\n\r\nencroachment  of  the  Federation  Government.  They\r\n\r\nforgot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  old  saying,  \"Who brought the  wolf  into  the\r\n\r\nhouse?\"  They  cannot  deliver  the  goods  on   the\r\n\r\nfinancial talks which they played up. They were back\r\n\r\nto  the same original position before they played up\r\n\r\nthe  financial talks. The whole propaganda  strategy\r\n\r\nboomeranged against the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, they gave away $50 million in another form, in the form of an interest-free loan. The P.A.P. leadership knew they were finished. Sir, I say that they will not get more than five seats in the 51-seat contest if it is held in September, that is, two months from now, or only a few weeks from\r\n\r\nnow, and their five seats will diminish in number as\r\n\r\ntime  passes by as the people of Singapore  see  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement  and  the  new  Constitution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  work out in practice to the detriment  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. Therefore, the P.A.P. must do something\r\n\r\nin  their power to save themselves after signing the\r\n\r\nfatal  Malaysia  Agreement. Any straw  is  good  for\r\n\r\nthem; any straw is good for sinking people. It  must\r\n\r\nhave been somewhere near midnight when the Singapore\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister -or was it about 9.30 - went from  his\r\n\r\nPark  Lane  Hotel - I believe, Sir, it  costs \ufffd30  a\r\n\r\nnight  - to see the Federation Prime Minister at  the\r\n\r\nRitz  Hotel. The Singapore Prime Minister must  have\r\n\r\nput  forward five items of discussion and begged the\r\n\r\nFederation Prime Minister to agree. The first  point\r\n\r\non labour arising from Singapore's $150 million loan\r\n\r\nto the Borneo State is to explain why Singapore gave\r\n\r\naway  $50 million worth of interest. We have to  pay\r\n\r\n$50  million worth of interest to get this loan  and\r\n\r\nin turn lend it to the Borneo State. The other three\r\n\r\npoints  are  to  save the collapse  of  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nparticularly asking for the rights to detain  people\r\n\r\nunder   the   Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The main purpose of this request is  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government will have the power  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  political opponents since the Preservation  of\r\n\r\nPublic Security Ordinance has been given away to the\r\n\r\nFederation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I can imagine that the Federation\r\n\r\nPrime Minister was tired between the nocturnal hours of 7th and  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8th July. The Singapore Prime Minister can be a very\r\n\r\npersistent  man.  He has the capacity  to  drum  his\r\n\r\nviews  into  a  person  for  hours  and  hours.  The\r\n\r\nFederation Prime Minister requiring sleep must  have\r\n\r\nlistened  impatiently, and being a good-natured  man\r\n\r\nand requiring more sleep because he is an older man,\r\n\r\ncould  have  nodded his head and  said,  \"Yah,  yah,\r\n\r\nyah,\"  which  means nothing at all.  [Laughter]  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, it is like the Singapore Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance. When he listens to a request for funds,  he\r\n\r\nnods  his head, and all the time he says, \"Yes, yes,\r\n\r\nyes.\"  But  he does not mean that he agrees  to  the\r\n\r\nrequest  for  funds.  The Singapore  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ncould  have  then  taken away the used  envelope  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Federation Prime Minister had  scribbled\r\n\r\nsome  notes on points raised by the Singapore  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  He  therefore waited until  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement was signed on the 9th of July, and on  the\r\n\r\n10th of July, he shot a memorandum to the Federation\r\n\r\nPrime Minister hoping by this memorandum to get  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime Minister committed. The Federation\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, being an equally astute politician,\r\n\r\ndid  not  reply and confirm the memorandum. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  in this exchange of letters as contained in the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  Misc.  5 of 1963, in  this  bundle  of\r\n\r\nDocuments, we did not see any reply, any memorandum,\r\n\r\nfrom  the Federation Prime Minister confirming  this\r\n\r\nso-called agreement on the 5 points. Mr Speaker, is\r\n\r\nthis not unusual? The P.A.P. Government has a lot to\r\n\r\nexplain   to   the  people.  Today  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment have not only issued a denial  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  agreed  to  the  five points,  but  they  have\r\n\r\nproduced   a   photostat  copy  which  is   slightly\r\n\r\ndifferent from the photostat copy published  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, we have  two\r\n\r\nphotostat  copies.  I  do  not  know  which  one  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  We  have  in  the Nan  yang  Siang  Pau  a\r\n\r\nphotostat copy which is more or less the same as the\r\n\r\nphotostat copy produced in the White Paper  Misc.  5\r\n\r\nof  1963,  but  it seems to me that there  are  many\r\n\r\nwords  here with crosses and marks not contained  in\r\n\r\nthe Singapore photostat copy. Sir, I must admit that\r\n\r\nI am getting more and more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfused.  There  are two versions of  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement; there might even be three versions. There\r\n\r\nare  two  versions of what happened in a bedroom  at\r\n\r\nthe Ritz Hotel on the night of either the 7th or the\r\n\r\n8th  of  July.  Sir, these are vital  constitutional\r\n\r\nmatters and issues affecting the fate and the  lives\r\n\r\nof  1.8 million people and our future. These are not\r\n\r\nfour-digit  lottery  numbers written  on  scraps  of\r\n\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these constitutional documents are irrevocable. They will forever in perpetuity seal the fate of the people of Singapore. They are hundreds of times more important than the 1958 Singapore Constitution which is only for a period of a few years. Mr Speaker, Sir, yet when the 1958\r\n\r\nSingapore  Constitution was  signed  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  it  was signed by an All-Party  Delegation\r\n\r\nand  it  had the backing of all the Parties and  the\r\n\r\npeople   in  Singapore.  The  broad  principles   of\r\n\r\nconstitutional  advancement were at first  discussed\r\n\r\nat  an  All-Party  Conference  and  debated  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly and all Party delegations took part in  the\r\n\r\ndetailed   negotiations  on   the   1958   Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution in the United Kingdom. Draft copies  of\r\n\r\nthe  1958 Constitution were circulated to Opposition\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  giving them ample  time  to  study  the\r\n\r\ndetailed  provisions so that they could  fully  take\r\n\r\npart  in  the  debate.  But, Sir,  here  we  have  a\r\n\r\nminority  P.A.P. Government which,  if  it  has  any\r\n\r\nsense  of  decency left, should have  resigned  last\r\n\r\nThursday on the undemocratic Federal Elections  Bill\r\n\r\nafter  having  promised to do so. Here,  we  have  a\r\n\r\nGovernment which has no majority, a Government which\r\n\r\nhas  lost  two  key by-elections, signing  away  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  the people of Singapore.  How  can  this\r\n\r\nminority   P.A.P.  Government  sign  on  behalf   of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  They have lost their mandate  to  govern\r\n\r\nlong  ago.  Even in this Assembly which was  elected\r\n\r\nmore  than  four  years  ago  and  where  the  power\r\n\r\nposition  has shifted considerably since  1959,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government has suffered an ignominous defeat\r\n\r\non  the  vital  Bill, and they should have  resigned\r\n\r\nthere and then on their solemn undertaking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not understand why this Government want to linger on from clay to day in office like the Lim Yew Hock Government did before the 1959 general elections. Why do the P.A.P. Government want to commit the rights of the people of Singapore deeper and deeper down the drain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the documents in the Malaysia Agreement must be looked at from two aspects. The first aspect is that it is primarily a sell-out treaty signed by two persons representing a minority Government of Singapore. The second aspect is that in consideration of hawking away the rights of the people the P.A.P. Government managed to get a few\r\n\r\nconcessions  here  and there for their  own  selfish\r\n\r\ninterest  which  they  hope  would  resuscitate  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., and if the Federation Government is prepared\r\n\r\nto be the scapegoat for destroying P.A.P. opponents,\r\n\r\nthen the way is open for a higher ambition - the road\r\n\r\nto  Prime  Ministership of Malaysia. Of  course,  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  that  is an idle, vain  dream.  At  this\r\n\r\nmoment,  if  the P.A.P. were to hold a clean  honest\r\n\r\nelection,  they would not get even  one  of  the  15\r\n\r\nseats to the Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us examine the sell-out aspect of the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Agreement. First of all, there is the sell-out  on  citizenship rights. I have often said  that\r\n\r\nthere  will be two classes of Malaysian citizenship:\r\n\r\none  class  meant  for citizens of  the  11  Malayan\r\n\r\nStates  and  the  two Borneo States of  Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nSabah,  and the other class is an inferior class  of\r\n\r\nMalaysian  citizenship  (Singapore)  meant  for  the 624,000  citizens of Singapore. The two  classes  of\r\n\r\nMalaysian  citizenship  are not  interchangeable  by\r\n\r\nmoving  residence and this distinction  will  remain\r\n\r\nfor  ever, for many, many centuries to come. It does\r\n\r\nnot  only  affect  the  present  generation  of  1.8\r\n\r\nmillion  people of Singapore but also  their  future\r\n\r\ngenerations.  There is no provision in the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement   to   provide  for  a   review   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  at some future date, so that  the  two\r\n\r\nclasses of Malaysian citizenship can be abolished,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that  one  class of Malaysian  citizenship  will\r\n\r\nremain.  Sir,  in  other words, there  will  be  two\r\n\r\nseparate    compartments   in   Malaysia   - entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  compartments - one compartment  comprises\r\n\r\nthe  11 Malayan States and the two Borneo States and\r\n\r\nthe  other  compartment is Singapore. The  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompartment is doomed for ever. Under the provisions\r\n\r\nof   the   Malaysia  Agreement,  even  if  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  increased greatly in number in  excess  of\r\n\r\nits  present  624,000 citizens  to  even,  say,  one\r\n\r\nmillion,  and  let us assume the other  compartment,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  Federation and the Borneo States  have\r\n\r\nnot increased at all, yet Singapore's representation\r\n\r\nin  the Central Parliament would always remain at 15\r\n\r\nseats.  There is no provision for review  and  under\r\n\r\nthe Malaysia Agreement Article 31, sub-clause (1), a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen can only be elected as a Member of\r\n\r\nParliament. He cannot go elsewhere and vote or stand\r\n\r\nfor  election,  but in the case of  the  first-class\r\n\r\nMalaysian  citizenship, he can go  anywhere,  stand,\r\n\r\nvote and be elected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nNot in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I\r\n\r\nheard  an  interesting joke, that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs did not even read the Constitution  on\r\n\r\nthe  citizenship issue. There is no  provision.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker Sir,In that case, since the increase in the\r\n\r\nnumber   of  Singapore  citizens  does  not   affect\r\n\r\nSingapore's  representation of M.P.s in the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment,  then it should only be  fair  that  the\r\n\r\nright  to  confer and deprive Singapore  citizenship\r\n\r\nshould rest solely on the Singapore Legislature  and\r\n\r\non the Singapore Government. But this is not what we\r\n\r\nexpect   in  the  Malaysia  Agreement.  The  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  take  away  the  basic  rights  of\r\n\r\nconferring   Singapore  citizenship  and   depriving\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship. The right to confer Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship by naturalisation goes to the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment under Article 27 (1)  (a)  (ii). Of course,\r\n\r\nit  is  provided that the Singapore Government  must\r\n\r\nconcur.  The  Singapore Government has no  right  to\r\n\r\ndeprive the citizenship of a person naturalised as a\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizen  by the Federation Government. The Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has no right to deprive the  citizenship\r\n\r\nof  a  person naturalised as a Singapore citizen  by\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government. They confer on  somebody\r\n\r\nwhom  we  do not like, Singapore citizenship status,\r\n\r\nand  we  cannot revoke it. The Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nhas  the  right to approve Singapore citizenship  by\r\n\r\nregistration   -only  by  registration.   But   such\r\n\r\napproval  requires the concurrence of the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. That is contained in Article 57  (1)   of\r\n\r\nthe    Singapore   Constitution.   The    Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment can deprive any Singapore citizen of  his\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship by depriving the latter of his\r\n\r\nsecond-class Malaysia citizenship under  Article  23\r\n\r\n(3)  of the Malaysia Act. Mr Speaker. Sir, what will\r\n\r\nhappen  is  this. We will be Singapore  citizens  as\r\n\r\nwell   as   second-class  Malaysia   citizens.   The\r\n\r\nFederation Government, by depriving us of our second-class   Malaysia  citizenship,  will   automatically\r\n\r\ndeprive us of our Singapore citizenship. Is this not\r\n\r\na  sell-out? I must refer you to clause  64  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Constitution which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Where a person who is a citizen of Singapore has\r\n\r\nrenounced  his  citizenship  of  Malaysia  or   been\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  his  citizenship of  Malaysia  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of the Federation such person  shall  be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  have renounced or been deprived  of  his\r\n\r\ncitizenship of Singapore under this Constitution and\r\n\r\nsuch   person   shall  cease  to   be   citizen   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Is   this  clause  not  unfair  to  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore? Why should the minority P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\ncommit  the  destiny of 624,000 Singapore  citizens?\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore Assembly and the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  full  autonomy  on  questions  of\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship because Singapore is not being\r\n\r\naccepted  in a genuine merger. Second-class Malaysia\r\n\r\ncitizenship  (Singapore) is  entirely  a  class  and\r\n\r\nstatus  all  on  its own. Why should the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  be allowed to interfere in the  granting\r\n\r\nand depriving of Singapore citizenship when the fact\r\n\r\nis  that  whether  we have more  or  less  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens makes no difference to the number of  seats\r\n\r\nin  the  Central  Parliament? Sir,  we  should  have\r\n\r\ncomplete  autonomy  on  the question,  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship, that is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  question of even controlling an inferior  class\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia citizenship (Singapore) and that  right\r\n\r\nis  now  denied  us. There is no autonomy  given  to\r\n\r\nSingapore on Singapore citizenship. This should have\r\n\r\nbeen the case since Singapore is to be considered  a\r\n\r\nseparate  unit  under the control of the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  not  fully  integrated   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under the Malaysia Agreement the granting of\r\n\r\ncitizenship by registration requires the sanction of\r\n\r\nboth  the  Singapore Government and  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This  is under clause  57  (1)   of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Constitution.   Therefore,   Sir,   when\r\n\r\napplying  for  Singapore  citizenship,  instead   of\r\n\r\nhaving one hurdle to cross as at present, there will\r\n\r\nbe two hurdles to cross in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we must please both the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Federation Government in order to\r\n\r\nacquire  Singapore citizenship, which  automatically\r\n\r\nmakes   us   a   second-class  Malaysia  citizenship\r\n\r\n(Singapore).   Similarly,   both   the    Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Singapore Government have  powers\r\n\r\nto  deprive Singapore citizens of their citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, Sir, one has to be nice not only to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government but also to the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. I refer you to section 61 and section 64\r\n\r\nof   the   proposed   Singapore  Constitution.   The\r\n\r\nFederation  Government can, on its own, without  our\r\n\r\nconsent, grant to Singapore citizens, as I have said\r\n\r\njust   now,  the  status  of  Singapore  citizenship\r\n\r\nthrough  the process of naturalisation. This  is  so\r\n\r\neven  though the Singapore Government might consider\r\n\r\nsuch  a person undesirable. To add insult to injury,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government has no right to cancel the\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship  of  such  a  person  who  is\r\n\r\ngranted   citizenship  by  naturalisation   by   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government. May I refer you  to  section\r\n\r\n61(5)   of the Singapore Constitution? It is a  pity,\r\n\r\nSir, that this P.A.P. minority government give us so\r\n\r\nlittle  time  to study the constitutional  documents\r\n\r\nmore carefully and in greater detail. Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government what is going to happen to the\r\n\r\ntens   of  thousands  of  applicants  for  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship which are still pending?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure if more time is given to the Opposition\r\n\r\nand  if  these  vital constitutional documents  were\r\n\r\ntranslated  into  all the vernacular  languages  and\r\n\r\npublished  in the Press, the Government  would  know\r\n\r\nthe  temper  of  the  country,  the  temper  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to these sell-out documents. What type of\r\n\r\nmerger  is this? What type of country are we heading\r\n\r\nfor?  Is  there any similar Federation elsewhere  in\r\n\r\nthe world?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 60 (3) of the Malaysia Act gives the\r\n\r\nFederation Government the right to restrict  second-class  Malaysia citizenship of Singapore  travelling\r\n\r\nto  or  residing in any part of Malaysia,  including\r\n\r\nthe Borneo territories. Sir, this is a shame. Why do\r\n\r\nthe  minority P.A.P. Government accept this shameful\r\n\r\ncondition? In other words, the Federation Government\r\n\r\ncan tomorrow, after Malaysia, close the Causeway and\r\n\r\nprevent  the entry of second-class Malaysia citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. Likewise Sabah and Sarawak can forbid\r\n\r\nentry   of   second-class  Malaysia  citizens   from\r\n\r\nSingapore into the Borneo territories. Is this not a\r\n\r\ncomplete sell-out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you to section 14 of the Immigration\r\n\r\nAct  which  is  part  and  parcel  of  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement? Section 14 of the Immigration  Act  which\r\n\r\nis  part of the Malaysia Agreement provides that  we\r\n\r\nrequire a so-called internal travel document  to  go\r\n\r\nto   Borneo.  Why  call  this  an  internal   travel\r\n\r\ndocument?  Why not call it a passport and visa?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  may I ask this P.A.P. minority  Government\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is any other country  in  the  world\r\n\r\nwhere citizens in the same country are forbidden  to\r\n\r\ntravel  freely  within its national boundaries?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, out of the hundred over countries  is\r\n\r\nthere any other parallel?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 6 of the White Paper has promised the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore that the fundamental liberties of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore will be adequately safeguarded\r\n\r\nin  the  provisions of the Federation  Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut  under  the  Malaysia Agreement our  fundamental\r\n\r\nliberties   are  all  conscribed.   They   are   not\r\n\r\nprotected.  They are not safeguarded.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nneed for the Prime Minister to try to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconceal   these  restrictions  on  the   fundamental\r\n\r\nliberties  of second-class citizens of Singapore  by\r\n\r\nmaking a Ministerial statement on religious freedom.\r\n\r\nWhy  does the Prime Minister not come here and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Countrymen, all of you have the freedom to  breathe\r\n\r\nfresh air.\"? It is a right which we already have and\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  now enjoying. Why  does  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment agree to all these conscriptions  of  our\r\n\r\nfundamental liberties, of our freedom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us compare our inferior citizenship status to\r\n\r\nthe  citizenship provisions accorded  to  Sabah  and\r\n\r\nSarawak. Their citizens will be treated as equals of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  citizens from the 11 Malayan States.  They\r\n\r\nwill  have no distinction. They will have  the  same\r\n\r\ntype of citizenship. They will have the same status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the second sell-out of the P.A.P. minority Government is the number of seats which the Prime Minister has accepted in the Central Parliament. The first sell-out is on the citizenship rights. The second sell-out is on the number of seats in the Central Parliament. Article 9 of the Malaysia Act provides for 15 members from Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith 1.8 million people, compared to 16 members from\r\n\r\nSabah, with a quarter of Singapore's population.  We\r\n\r\nhave  1.8 million people and we have only 15  M.P.s.\r\n\r\nSabah  has  only 400,000 people and they  have  more\r\n\r\nM.P.s  than  Singapore. Is this not  another  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsell-out? Sir, to make matters worse, this ratio  is\r\n\r\nfixed,  under  the  Malaysia Act,  indefinitely  and\r\n\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no provision to review the position after\r\n\r\na  period of time where adjustments can be  made  to\r\n\r\nrectify   the  wrongs  perpetrated  by  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I remember the Prime Minister  said  in\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang sometime early this year  during  his\r\n\r\nrural  visits that Singapore will have the right  to\r\n\r\nreview   the   position   and   can   increase   its\r\n\r\nrepresentation in the Central Parliament to even  40\r\n\r\nor  100  seats if necessary when the time  comes.  I\r\n\r\nhave  searched through the documents and cannot find\r\n\r\nsuch  a  provision.  It is my  belief  that  such  a\r\n\r\nprovision  does  not  exist.  The  minority   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  therefore not  only  sold  out  the\r\n\r\npresent generation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlock,  stock and barrel. It has sold out the  future\r\n\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister told the people that Singapore has accepted less seats compared to Sabah because it will have financial autonomy. He said, without financial autonomy the Federation can hold a future Singapore State Government to ransom. Sir, where is Singapore's financial autonomy? Can the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment tell us Opposition Members where to  find\r\n\r\nit?  I  have  searched  through  the  Constitutional\r\n\r\ndocuments  during the last few days and I could  not\r\n\r\nfind  it.  There  is  no  such  thing  as  financial\r\n\r\nautonomy for Singapore. The vital power to legislate\r\n\r\non  taxes  belongs  to  the  Federation  Government.\r\n\r\nMonetary and fiscal policies to create prosperity or\r\n\r\na  boom  or  a depression are in the powers  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   Government,  in  other   words,   basic\r\n\r\nfinancial   powers  on  legislation   and   policies\r\n\r\nconcerning   finance  belong   to   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Income Tax law, from 9th July, 1963, it is\r\n\r\nwritten   into  the  Malaysia  Agreement  that   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government will have no  more  powers  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  even new amendments. It is  not  only  on\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax legislation that the Federation Minister\r\n\r\nof  Finance  is  given full powers.  The  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  can actually at any time take  over  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Income Tax Department; and even  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter  the  Customs  and  Excise  Departments.  The\r\n\r\nFederation   Government  can  check   the   detailed\r\n\r\nworkings  of  the  Singapore Income  Tax  Department\r\n\r\nthrough  its Comptroller-General of Income Tax,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the Customs and Excise Department through  its\r\n\r\nspecial  inspectors. Mr Speaker, Sir,  relief  from\r\n\r\nincome  tax  on depreciation, and Orders made  under\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Expansion (Relief from  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1959),  shall rest with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. These powers are important because  they\r\n\r\nare relevant to industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Customs and on Income Tax the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It  is  not the separation  of  powers\r\n\r\nbetween Federal and State. It is different from  the\r\n\r\nList of State powers enumerated, where the Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislature  will  in future have jurisdiction  over\r\n\r\nthe  list  of enumerated State powers. The Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment's  running  of  Income  Tax  and  Customs\r\n\r\nDepartments  would  be delegated by  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment to the Singapore Government.

I have studied Articles 8, 9, 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said in this Assembly before, what\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government has been fighting for and  has\r\n\r\nbeen playing up its propaganda in the past few months\r\n\r\nis  to  have  the  right to be a rent collector.  The\r\n\r\nmoney  collected  by  the Singapore  Government  from\r\n\r\nnational  taxes,  according  to  Article  6  of   the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Agreement,  has  to  be  paid   into   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Central  Bank which will  open  a  Branch\r\n\r\nOffice  in  Singapore.  In other  words,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is nothing but a rent collector.  If  the\r\n\r\nrent  collector  behaves, or if the  boss  likes  his\r\n\r\nface,  then he is allowed to collect rent,  and  this\r\n\r\nrent is to be in the form of cheques, which will have\r\n\r\nto  be  paid into the boss's banking account.

Moreover all these  departments  for\r\n\r\nthe collection of taxes can be taken back at any time\r\n\r\nunder  some  pretext given under  Article  5  of  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Agreement. I only refer to the main  powers\r\n\r\nof  finance given to the Central - I am not  referring\r\n\r\nto  the other 14 items of financial powers which  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government   has   surrendered   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is  no\r\n\r\nautonomy in finance. We will only be acting  as  rent\r\n\r\ncollectors. Sir, is this not another sell-out by  the\r\n\r\nminority P.A.P. Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sell-out is citizenship rights: the\r\n\r\nsecond  sell-out  is representation  in  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament;  the third sell-out is financial  rights.\r\n\r\nThe  fourth  sell-out is on the List of State  rights\r\n\r\ngiven   to   Singapore,  which  the  P.A.P. minority\r\n\r\nGovernment  has accepted on behalf of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If  we  compare  Part  I  of  the  Fourth\r\n\r\nSchedule  to the Malaysia Act, which is State  rights\r\n\r\nfor  the  Borneo States, and Part II  of  the  Fourth\r\n\r\nSchedule  to the Malaysia Act, which is State  rights\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore,  we will see that  the  State  rights\r\n\r\ngiven  to the Borneo States and to Singapore  do  not\r\n\r\ndiffer  very significantly. Not only so,  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  during  the first five years after  Malaysia,\r\n\r\ncan  manage  to get substantial aid of $500  million,\r\n\r\nand  Singapore will have to advance them more or less\r\n\r\nan interest-free loan of $150\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion.  Sabah,  with  one-quarter  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\npopulation, gets more representation in the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament than Singapore. The Borneo States,  under\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  Immigration Bill,  can  restrict  the\r\n\r\nimmigration  of people from other parts of  Malaysia\r\n\r\ninto their territories. Mr Speaker, Sir, these  are\r\n\r\nthe State rights given to Sabah, almost equal to the\r\n\r\nState rights given to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabah has more representation in Parliament\r\n\r\nalthough  they only have one-quarter of  Singapore's\r\n\r\npopulation; $500 million free financial aid to Sabah\r\n\r\nand  Sarawak  in the space of five years;  and  $150\r\n\r\nmillion  more or less interest-free loan which  will\r\n\r\ncost  the  Singapore taxpayers $50  million,  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to Sabah and Sarawak during the course of  15\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borneo States will have the right to restrict\r\n\r\nimmigration into Sabah and Sarawak. Under Article 60\r\n\r\n(3)   of the Malaysia Act, the Federal Government can\r\n\r\nrestrict the movement of Singapore citizens into the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Under  section 14  of  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nBill, Sarawak and Sabah can restrict entry of second-class  Malaysian  citizens  of  Singapore  into  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  States. Sir, what happens? Under section  60\r\n\r\n(3)   of  the Malaysia Act, the Federation Government\r\n\r\ncan  stop us from moving across the Causeway.  Under\r\n\r\nsection  14  of  the Immigration  Act,  Borneo  will\r\n\r\nprevent  us from going to Borneo. What are we  like,\r\n\r\nSir?  Singapore citizens would be like turtles in  a\r\n\r\nstagnant pond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have a closer look and compare the\r\n\r\nrespective  State  rights reserved  for  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  and for Singapore? If we have the two Lists,\r\n\r\nPart   I   and  Part  II,  of  the  Fourth  Schedule\r\n\r\nenumerated  and  tabulated we  will  find  that  the\r\n\r\npowers   given  to  Singapore  and  to  the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories are more or less similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many powers exactly similar given to\r\n\r\nboth  places.  For  instance, medicine  and  health,\r\n\r\nfamily laws, charitable trust, State elections for a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time.  Mr  Speaker,  these  powers  are\r\n\r\nsimilarly reserved and accorded to both territories.\r\n\r\nThen there are little sundry powers given to each of\r\n\r\nthe territories which are peculiar to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neach  of  them. For instance, Sabah will  run  Sabah\r\n\r\nRailways, Singapore will run its own gas works.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  it is of no use for Singapore to have  the\r\n\r\nright to run the Singapore Railway because we do not\r\n\r\nhave  one. It is neither useful for Sabah to  run  a\r\n\r\ngas works because Sabah does not have any gas works.\r\n\r\nSo Sabah will run the Sabah Railways; Singapore will\r\n\r\nrun Singapore's gas works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than all these, there are only two items of\r\n\r\nimportance  reserved  for Singapore  which  are  not\r\n\r\nfound  in the List given to Borneo, namely, the  two\r\n\r\nsubjects of education and labour. Sir, let  us  look\r\n\r\nat  these two items more closely. Let us first  talk\r\n\r\nabout  labour.  In Singapore we face  a  surplus  of\r\n\r\nlabour; in Borneo there is a shortage of labour. Due\r\n\r\nto the labour shortage there and therefore the rates\r\n\r\nof  wages  there  are high - it is believed  that  in\r\n\r\nSabah a hard-working lumberman can get from $500  to\r\n\r\n$700 a month - there is hardly any labour problem.  It\r\n\r\nis  the  same  even  in Sarawak. There  is  not  the\r\n\r\npressing  necessity for a Ministry of  Labour.  They\r\n\r\ntherefore do not need so-called autonomy in handling\r\n\r\ntheir  own labour problem, because they hardly  have\r\n\r\nany  labour problem. Their main concern is  to  keep\r\n\r\naway  immigrants, and the Immigration Bill contained\r\n\r\nin  the  Malaysia Act has given them  the  right  to\r\n\r\nprohibit immigrants from entering Sabah and Sarawak,\r\n\r\nespecially   immigrants  of  second-class   Malaysia\r\n\r\ncitizens from Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that we are supposed to belong to\r\n\r\none country - Malaysia - the people in Singapore cannot\r\n\r\ngo  to  Borneo  to  get jobs or do business  freely.\r\n\r\nSecond-class  Malaysia citizens from  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  apply  for internal travel  documents,\r\n\r\neven  to  visit Sabah or Sarawak. Which country  has\r\n\r\nsuch  an absurd phenomenum? In other words,  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of so-called autonomy in labour, Singapore\r\n\r\ndoes  not get more than what the Borneo States  get,\r\n\r\nbecause the Borneo States do not require autonomy in\r\n\r\nlabour. What they require is an Immigration Act  and\r\n\r\nthey have got it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, let us look at education. Due to the fact\r\n\r\nthat the Borneo States have not been so developed in\r\n\r\nmany  respects compared to Singapore, and  education\r\n\r\nis one of them, there is not the problem relating to\r\n\r\nthe  question  of education as exists in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever,  on  the question of the use  of  language,\r\n\r\nArticle 6 of the Malaysia Act guarantees the use  of\r\n\r\nthe  English  language for a minimum  period  of  10\r\n\r\nyears  and the protection of native languages,  laws\r\n\r\nand  customs.  The so-called autonomy  in  education\r\n\r\ngiven  to  Singapore does not, therefore, make  much\r\n\r\nsubstantial  difference  in  the  quantum  of  State\r\n\r\nrights   given  to  respective  territories  between\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Borneo  States.  I   therefore\r\n\r\nconclude  that the respective State rights given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo States and to Singapore, if they can  be\r\n\r\nmeasured  in  quantum, are almost equal.  Yet  Sabah\r\n\r\nwith one quarter of Singapore's population, gets  16\r\n\r\nseats  in the Central Parliament, which is one  seat\r\n\r\nmore than Singapore's 15 seats. Mr Speaker, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthis not a sell-out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, four fundamental sell-outs. First\r\n\r\ncitizenship   rights;  second,   the   question   of\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in  Parliament;  thirdly,  financial\r\n\r\npowers;  and, fourthly, State rights. Singapore  has\r\n\r\nto  contribute each year 40 per cent of the national\r\n\r\ntaxes  or  28  per cent of all revenue collected.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  at one time the P.A.P. Government  told  us\r\n\r\nthat it was 25 per cent. Now it has increased to  28\r\n\r\nper  cent. In other words, for every dollar of  tax,\r\n\r\ncustoms  duties, traffic fines on poor taxi-drivers,\r\n\r\nor fines on hawkers, fees from hospitals, and school\r\n\r\nfees - all types of revenue raised in Singapore under\r\n\r\nthe  sun  from  every  citizen of  Singapore,  every\r\n\r\ndollar collected in Singapore, we have to pay to the\r\n\r\nFederation a tribute of 28 cents, 28 per cent of the\r\n\r\ntotal  revenue  collected, or 40  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nnational taxes. The amount of revenue contributed to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation will increase year by year,  because\r\n\r\nunder  the Financial Agreement the percentage  basis\r\n\r\nhas been used. Moreover, Singapore has to give about\r\n\r\n$150  million loan, almost free of interest, to  the\r\n\r\nBorneo States, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill cost the Singapore Government about $50 million\r\n\r\nto   raise  because  interest  has  to  be  paid  by\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  the loan. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  have\r\n\r\ncomputed  a  small table with the little information\r\n\r\nand  the little time available to me because we have\r\n\r\nonly a few days to study these vital Constitutional\r\n\r\ndocuments. I have computed that if we were  to  give\r\n\r\n$100  million  free-interest loan to the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  - a $100 million 15-year loan,  starting\r\n\r\nwith  $20 million in 1964, $20 million in 1965,  and\r\n\r\n$20  million in each subsequent year ending in  1968\r\n\r\n- we  would  have to pay $48 million in  interest  to\r\n\r\nthose  persons  from  whom we have  to  borrow.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this is the greatest  cheat  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government. The Singapore Government, before\r\n\r\nthey  went  to  London to sign the sell-out  treaty,\r\n\r\ntold  us  that the main fight was on the $50,000,000\r\n\r\ngift  to  the  Borneo States. They  went  there  and\r\n\r\nsigned  this sell-out treaty. They gave more than  a\r\n\r\n$100  million  contribution  as  a  tribute  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government each year. In addition,  they\r\n\r\nare  giving  an interest-free 15-year loan  of  $100\r\n\r\nmillion  with a proviso of reviewing the loan  after\r\n\r\nfive  years,  whether interest  should  be  paid  in\r\n\r\nsubsequent  years  or not; but  the  proviso  is  so\r\n\r\nflexible, that it seems no interest will be paid  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  payment of  interest  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nhinges  on Singapore's prosperity - Singapore  always\r\n\r\nprospers,  even  without  Malaysia.  It  is  just  a\r\n\r\nnatural  process.  If we compare the  budget  of  10\r\n\r\nyears  ago  with the budget of today, Singapore  has\r\n\r\nprospered  many times over. And, therefore,  because\r\n\r\nof  that fact, it looks likely that the interest for\r\n\r\nthe  subsequent  live years will be  waived  to  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  States.  Mr Speaker, Sir, working  on  that\r\n\r\nbasis.  I  have computed that the cost on the  loans\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Singapore Government have to  raise  for\r\n\r\nBorneo,  paying an average of six per cent  interest\r\n\r\non  a $100 million loan, comes to about $48 million.\r\n\r\nAnd  if this includes the cost of raising the  loans\r\n\r\nand  the  administrative expenses, which I  estimate\r\n\r\nat,  say, $1 million or $2 million, it makes a grand\r\n\r\ntotal of $50 million. It therefore comes to the same\r\n\r\nthing.  A  face-saving  device  whereby  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan come back and deceive the people again. But, the\r\n\r\npeople will not be deceived. The people have no more\r\n\r\ntrust  and  no more faith in the P.A.P.  Government.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P.  Government tried to explain  this  huge\r\n\r\ninterest-free  loan by saying that half  the  labour\r\n\r\nused for the loans would be obtained from Singapore.\r\n\r\nNow,  the  Federation Government have  denied  today\r\n\r\nthat they have ever agreed to that condition. Let us\r\n\r\nassume  that  the Federation Government has  agreed.\r\n\r\nCould  the  P.A.P. Government work out in  terms  of\r\n\r\nquantity  of  labour how much labour  Singapore  can\r\n\r\nexport to Sabah and Sarawak under this loan? If they\r\n\r\nare  going to build two gas works or a gas works and\r\n\r\nan  electrical station which will eat away the  $100\r\n\r\nmillion,  I think they will not engage more  than  a\r\n\r\nfew tens of workmen. Why does the P.A.P. not use the\r\n\r\n$150  million to develop Singapore whereby Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not only benefit from its development but more\r\n\r\nlabourers  will  be employed, more  shops  will  get\r\n\r\nbusiness.  This  is  what  we  call  the  multiplier\r\n\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the $150 million loan is used in the Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  and  even if they recruit some  labour  from\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it will only engage 30, 50  or,  let  us\r\n\r\nsay, 500 of Singapore's labourers; take away 500  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  unemployed labourers at a cost  of  $50\r\n\r\nmillion.  Those  are all the benefits  we  may  get.\r\n\r\nThere is no provision that they must get contractors\r\n\r\nfrom   Singapore.  Can  the  labour  recruited  from\r\n\r\nSingapore and working in Sabah ring up Singapore and\r\n\r\norder  coffee  and  tea, or buy shirts  from  Change\r\n\r\nAlley? No, Sir, but if these loans are being used in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  Singapore's  own  development,  then\r\n\r\nnormally one cent of development expenditure  should\r\n\r\ncreate  three or four cents of money in circulation.\r\n\r\nA  dollar investment creates $3 or $4 or $5 in money\r\n\r\ncirculation, because the workmen will be able to buy\r\n\r\nthings  from the shops; the shops get more business;\r\n\r\nthey   buy   things   from  the   wholesalers;   the\r\n\r\nwholesalers will make more money and order things\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  overseas; the Harbour Board will be busy;  and\r\n\r\neverybody  will be active. But we are  not  accorded\r\n\r\nthese benefits. We are being sold away. If Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  so much money, why borrow a few million dollars\r\n\r\nfrom the World Bank at 5\ufffd per cent interest? And  we\r\n\r\nmust pay \ufffd per cent to the World Bank even if we  do\r\n\r\nnot  draw  out the money. We must pay  5\ufffd  per  cent\r\n\r\ninterest with all sorts of strings attached. We have\r\n\r\nbeen  sold  out to the World Bank for a few  million\r\n\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenses incurred on the Police, the Prisons\r\n\r\nand  the  Armed  Forces in the Borneo States  would,\r\n\r\nlike   Singapore,  be  incurred   by   the   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment,  instead  we  understand  that  the  two\r\n\r\nBorneo  States  will  receive substantial  financial\r\n\r\naid,  as  I have said, to the extent of $500 million\r\n\r\nfor  five  years. Singapore has entered into  a  bad\r\n\r\nfinancial bargain. The P.A.P. has sold us  out.  The\r\n\r\ndifference between Singapore's contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government, and the Borneo States' financial\r\n\r\nassistance received from the Central Government  is,\r\n\r\nin  my  calculation, estimated  at  more  than  $200\r\n\r\nmillion  per year. We have to give to the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment more than $100 million a year. The Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  will receive from the Federation  Government\r\n\r\nmore  than  $100 million a year. It makes the  total\r\n\r\ndifference to be more than $200 million a year.  And\r\n\r\nthis $200 million a year is enough for Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbuild  about  40,000 S.I.T. flats a  year  or  4,000\r\n\r\nclinics  or 4,000 creches. Once Malaysia  is  pushed\r\n\r\nthrough  and  the  new  Singapore  Constitution   is\r\n\r\nallowed to work itself for a few months, the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore will then see for themselves the extent\r\n\r\nof  this sell-out Malaysia Agreement being put  into\r\n\r\noperation with all the disadvantages working against\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. We have so much to lose and\r\n\r\nso little to gain from the Malaysia Agreement. It is\r\n\r\ntherefore  based on this belief that  I  assess  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections for the 51 seats to  be  held  in\r\n\r\nSeptember this year. The P.A.P.

In\r\n\r\nother words, if the Federation Government decide  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  tyre factory in Petaling Jaya  and  not  in\r\n\r\nJurong,  it can refuse, it can veto such  a  pioneer\r\n\r\ncertificate granted by the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the Federation Government can make things\r\n\r\ntough  for  the Singapore Government, as the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  also  surrendered  other  rights  relevant   to\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  and industrial promotion.  Orders\r\n\r\nmade  under  the Industrial Expansion  (Relief  from\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax)  Ordinance, 1959, will  be  subject  to\r\n\r\napproval  by  the Federation Minister  for  Finance.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Tariff Advisory Board, which will  be  in\r\n\r\ncharge of Common Market problems and which will make\r\n\r\nall  the vital decisions, will be controlled by  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  - Annex  J.  Because  of  the\r\n\r\nunfavourable conditions, the people of Singapore may\r\n\r\nhave to suffer an increase in the cost of living due\r\n\r\nto   customs   duties  being  imposed   to   protect\r\n\r\nindustries  in  Petaling Jaya or Johore  Bahru,  but\r\n\r\nwithout  Singapore receiving any benefits.  Is  this\r\n\r\nnot another P.A.P. sell-out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malaysia Agreement is meant to sell out\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of  the people of Singapore  and  is\r\n\r\nsigned  by  the  minority P.A.P.  Government.  After\r\n\r\nsigning  the  Agreement, the P.A.P. Government  just\r\n\r\nwants  this  Assembly  to  endorse  what  they  have\r\n\r\nalready  ratified  and agreed upon.  The  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties were not consulted before the Agreement  was\r\n\r\nsigned.  The  draft Constitution was  not  discussed\r\n\r\nwith the Opposition Parties as was the case with the 1958  Singapore  Constitution. Everything  is  being\r\n\r\npushed  down our throats. Can the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\naccept  all  the consequences? Can it shoulder  this\r\n\r\ntremendous responsibility? But. Sir, what can we  do\r\n\r\nto  a political bankrupt who incurs more debts after\r\n\r\nhis   bankruptcy?  He  is  already  a  bankrupt  and\r\n\r\ntherefore he has nothing more to lose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I read under section 104 of the 1958 Singapore Constitution that even if we are to amend a clause in this temporary and transitional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>1958  Singapore  Constitution, we will  require  the\r\n\r\nconsent  of  a two-thirds majority of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislature. With this Malaysia Agreement  on  which\r\n\r\nhinges   the  destiny  of  1.8  million  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the generations to come, should we not\r\n\r\nalso have a two-thirds majority? We demand that this\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement  requires a two-thirds  majority\r\n\r\nand  if  it  is only passed by less than  that,  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Agreement must be repudiated. This Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement should have the minimum of 34 votes out of\r\n\r\n50.  We  have  now 50 votes in this  Assembly.  Two-thirds  out  of  50 is 34 and the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nmust muster 34 votes in order to convince us and the\r\n\r\npeople  that  even this out-of-date Legislature  has\r\n\r\napproved this sell-out document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said at the beginning of my speech that\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysia Agreement must be looked at  from  two\r\n\r\naspects. Firstly, it is basically a sell-out treaty.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  in  consideration of  its  sell-out,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  managed  to wriggle  out  for  its  own\r\n\r\nbenefit  with built-in safeguards and provisions  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  P.A.P. in the future, if it has any  more\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to read the dreams of a Japanese military\r\n\r\nman  - I have forgotten his name, but I think it  was\r\n\r\nTanaka  - who  submitted his  dreams  of  a  Japanese\r\n\r\nEmpire  to  the Japanese emperor many  decades  ago.\r\n\r\nUnder   his  notorious  plan,  he  hoped   that   by\r\n\r\nconquering Manchuria, which would be used as a  base\r\n\r\nagainst  China,  Japan  would  be  able  from  there\r\n\r\nonwards to create a Japanese-sponsored Greater East-Asia  Co-prosperity Sphere. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nour  Singapore Tanaka, who is not only  the  planner\r\n\r\nbut  the  prima donna, who is not only the  plotter,\r\n\r\nbut  the actor, has ambitions, however vain and idle\r\n\r\nwe  may look at them, to follow the path of conquest\r\n\r\nenvisaged by Tanaka many decades ago. The idea of  a\r\n\r\nCuba   in   Singapore  was  born  in   the   fertile\r\n\r\nimagination of the Prime Minister. I heard of it  as\r\n\r\nearly  as  1959.  He coined the  words  \"a  Cuba  in\r\n\r\nSingapore\". Nobody else coined those words. It was a\r\n\r\ngood propaganda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nline to frighten certain people and those people,  I\r\n\r\nmust say, swallowed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the White Paper proposals were conceived,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. was in the doldrums. Since  then,  many\r\n\r\nthanks  to the Work Brigade, the P.A.P. planned  the\r\n\r\nvisits  to the rural constituencies. I believe,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, that lately not only the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  surrounded the Prime Minister but at  every\r\n\r\nvisit  he requires about 150 plainclothes detectives\r\n\r\n- this is what I have heard - and many members of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Infantry Regiment -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Sahorah Binte Ahmat (Siglap):</b> Gila!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Chaps fired crackers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Member for Siglap should not\r\n\r\ninterrupt because her name, I believe, will  not  be\r\n\r\nin the next list of nominations for candidature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. leaders thought that\r\n\r\nthere  was some chance of staging a  come-back after all this fanfare.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.P.S.O., the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthe possible cancellation  of\r\n\r\nOpposition  Party  symbols on nomination  day,  were\r\n\r\nthought  to  be sufficient to crush the  Opposition.\r\n\r\nSince  they have been slowly building up  a  ray  of\r\n\r\nhope, however  faint  it  looks  to  us   in   the\r\n\r\nOpposition, the P.A.P. leaders have strong powers of\r\n\r\nauto-suggestion;  a  way must be  prepared  for  the\r\n\r\nconquest  of  Malaysia should  such  an  opportunity\r\n\r\narise,  and  such  an opportunity  should  never  be\r\n\r\nmissed.   Like  the  Japanese  venture  into   world\r\n\r\nconquest  step  by step, so is the  P.A.P.'s  future\r\n\r\ndream  of conquering Malaysia also step by step.  In\r\n\r\n10  years'  or at the most 15 years' time  when  the\r\n\r\nTunku  retires from active politics, the  course  is\r\n\r\nclear  for  a  P.A.P.  Prime  Minister.  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  what  vain and childish  hopes!  They  are\r\n\r\nnothing  but  a pipe-dream. The P.A.P. cannot  even\r\n\r\nhope  to go as far as the Japanese did. They reached\r\n\r\nthe  Australian  coast and nearly conquered  Hawaii.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the  first  step of the P.A.P.'s  dream  of\r\n\r\nconquest, which is contained -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> How far is yours?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> First, my dream is to knock out\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.

Mr Deputy Speaker,  there\r\n\r\nare  many hundreds of additional steps to go. In the\r\n\r\nfirst  step, Article 95, which the P.A.P.

That  is  why\r\n\r\nthey have been so demoralised these few days -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Most cheerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> The Minister for Culture has\r\n\r\nnever been thinner in his life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of additional steps to go.\r\n\r\nArticles  95 and 96 with special provisions  written\r\n\r\ninto the Malaysia Act give the P.A.P.

If such a situation arises, the general elections for the 51 seats will follow\r\n\r\nimmediately after the elections for the 15 seats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe the electoral registers can be used two or three times. They do not need to revise them. They can use it today for one election, and they can use it tomorrow for another election. But in case the P.A.P. loses the elections for the 15 seats, in spite of all the\r\n\r\nrigging,  then  there  is a  second  chance  because\r\n\r\ntransitional provisions have been built in Part  VII\r\n\r\nof  the new Singapore Constitution. Clause 98 of the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Constitution  will  allow   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  carry on until June  1964.  But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, this is now unlikely because we expect  some\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Back-benchers to quit and there will  be  no\r\n\r\nmeeting this year to approve the 1964 Budget. In the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  the  P.A.P. Government will  devise  some\r\n\r\nscheme  to  retrieve the position.  However,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, as I have said, the P.A.P. Government  will\r\n\r\nnot last that long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. hopes that Singapore will therefore\r\n\r\nbe  a  stepping  stone to getting greater  political\r\n\r\npowers  in  Malaysia. All these  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Constitution and in the Malaysia Act and in\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Constitution  were  meant,  in   my\r\n\r\nopinion, to fulfil this dream. For instance, Sir, in\r\n\r\nPart II of the Fourth Schedule in the Malaysian  Act\r\n\r\nenumerating State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrights for Singapore, they deliberately provide that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government could  have  powers  over\r\n\r\nelections  to the State Assembly until August  1968.\r\n\r\nSo,   Mr   Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  can rig the 15-seat election in  August,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  able  to rig  and  win  the  51-seat\r\n\r\nelections in September or October, thereby  becoming\r\n\r\nthe  State Government as well as having a number  of\r\n\r\nseats  in  the Central Parliament. From there,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhalf  the  battle is won to fulfil the  dream  of  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Prime Minister of Malaysia. As I have  said,\r\n\r\nthis is a false hope and an idle dream. Remember  in\r\n\r\nthe Hong Lim by-election, they were ready with their\r\n\r\nfanfare  of  lion  and dragon dances  for  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nvictory  in Hong Lim.

It is vital to the fulfilment\r\n\r\nof their dream. Sometimes it is very handy to have a\r\n\r\nlaw  which we can use to lock up political opponents\r\n\r\nwithout  trial  and calling them gangsters,  because\r\n\r\nthe Government do not have to prove it in the courts\r\n\r\nof  law.  Get  two  or  three  gangsters,  get  some\r\n\r\nofficials    from   the   State   Advocate-General's\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  put a chop - the man  goes  in  under\r\n\r\nsection   55   of   the  Criminal   Law   (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Ordinance.  We  warn  all  those  civil\r\n\r\nservants who play with the P.A.P. in these  acts  of\r\n\r\nsuppression of political opponents that the  day  of\r\n\r\nretribution might not be too far away. Section 55 of\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance is useful to nip in the bud aspiring\r\n\r\npoliticians or effective political opponents of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. regime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, in Annex K to the Malaysian\r\n\r\nAgreement,  concerning the agreement  on  Television\r\n\r\nand Radio,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit is vital when the P.A.P. decides to broadcast so-called  P.A.P. achievements in its  new  short-wave\r\n\r\nfrequency  radio  across  the  seas  to  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nStates,  spreading P.A.P. propaganda to  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 95 of the new Singapore Constitution is\r\n\r\nalso  vital.  As  in the case of the 1958  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  should\r\n\r\nremain  in  office for only six months after  a  new\r\n\r\ngovernment  is formed so that any future  government\r\n\r\nwill  decide,  subject to the Agong's approval,  who\r\n\r\nwill  be the next Yang di-Pertuan Negara during that\r\n\r\nParty's period of office. We are afraid that section\r\n\r\n95  will  want  to  avoid such a democratic  proviso\r\n\r\ncontained in the 1958 Singapore Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 99 of the Singapore Constitution concerns\r\n\r\nthe P.S.C. Both sections 95 and 99 are important, in\r\n\r\ncase  the  P.A.P. Government can win the next  State\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Of course, we know they cannot.  But  I\r\n\r\nmust say that no future government has an obligation\r\n\r\nto recognise every P.A.P. appointment. If the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nappointments had been done on the sole criterion  of\r\n\r\nmerit,  then  I am sure any future Government  would\r\n\r\nrecognise   these   appointments.   But    if    the\r\n\r\nappointments are not done on the basis of merit, but\r\n\r\nwere  done for some other purposes, then, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, let it be put on record that no future\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  got  the  necessity  to  meet  this\r\n\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these are only some of the provisions which the P.A.P. hope to save them from collapse and prop them up for future capture of power. Sir, they are only false hopes. The P.A.P. are finished. They should have resigned last Thursday, when the undemocratic Singapore (Elections\r\n\r\nto  the  Federal House of Representatives) Bill  was\r\n\r\ndefeated, through which the P.A.P. hoped to rig  the\r\n\r\nelections.  Sir,  the P.A.P.'s  days  are  numbered.\r\n\r\nToday and tomorrow, we will hear the departing  swan\r\n\r\nsong  of the P.A.P. leaders.

The rest of the\r\n\r\nBlue  Book  which was mentioned by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park was only a document tabled in the House,\r\n\r\nbut it was not subject to debate at all. Neither did\r\n\r\nit  have to go through three Readings. I have now  a\r\n\r\ncopy of the Blue Book. It did not say either that it\r\n\r\nis a Command Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to Article 69 of the Malaysia Bill and\r\n\r\nArticle 90 of the Singapore Constitution relating to\r\n\r\namendments to the Singapore Constitution. Article 69\r\n\r\nin   the  Malaysia  Bill,  at  page  47,  refers  to\r\n\r\nsafeguards   for  the  constitutional  position   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Article 69 (1)  reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No amendment shall be made to the Constitution\r\n\r\nwithout the concurrence of the Governor...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The   Constitution  here  refers  to   the   Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution. In other words, the Federal Parliament\r\n\r\ncannot change the Singapore Constitution without the\r\n\r\nconcurrence of the Singapore Government. The purpose\r\n\r\nof  this Article 69 is to protect certain rights  as\r\n\r\nembodied in the Singapore Constitution. You will see\r\n\r\nthat  a  similar clause refers to the constitutional\r\n\r\nposition  of the Borneo States. This is  in  Article\r\n\r\n66, at page 45, of the Malaysia Bill. Article 66 (2) \r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No amendment shall be made to the Constitution [in\r\n\r\nthis   case   again  it  refers   to   the   Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution]   without  the  concurrence   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernor  of the Borneo State or each of the  Borneo\r\n\r\nStates concerned,...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, the Federal Parliament cannot amend\r\n\r\neither    the   Singapore   Constitution   or    the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Sabah or the Constitution of Sarawak\r\n\r\nwithout  the approval of the Governments  of  Sabah,\r\n\r\nSarawak or Singapore. That is the meaning of Article\r\n\r\n69.  Therefore.  Article 69  does  not  in  any  way\r\n\r\nconflict   with   Article  90   of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution  where  it  is  stipulated   that   any\r\n\r\nalterations  to  the  Singapore  Constitution  would\r\n\r\nrequire a two-thirds majority of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Is it a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order.

But they  did  not  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  word in that written document. At  least  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim had the courage to seek a  fresh\r\n\r\nmandate and he won the by-election.

I am\r\n\r\nsorry for the Member for Anson that he finds himself\r\n\r\nin  this position. He won the Anson by-election  but\r\n\r\nhe  has  lost his Party. So the question  is,  where\r\n\r\ndoes he stand? However, the Member for Anson and the 14  Members  from  the  Barisan  Sosialis  need  not\r\n\r\nparticularly  worry  at time  moment  because  their\r\n\r\nseats  in this present Assembly are secured  by  the\r\n\r\ntemporary and transitional provisions of Article 96.\r\n\r\nArticle 96 of the transitional provisions - it  is  a\r\n\r\ntransitional provision - states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) The Legislative Assembly established by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  (Constitution) Order  in  Council,  1958,\r\n\r\n[meaning  this Assembly] shall remain in  being  and\r\n\r\nshall  be  deemed  to  be the  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nestablished by this Constitution, and accordingly -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the persons who immediately before the coming\r\n\r\ninto  operation of this Constitution hold  the\r\n\r\noffices  of  Speaker  and  Deputy  Speaker  or\r\n\r\nMembers of the Legislative Assembly shall,  on\r\n\r\nthe    coming   into   operation    of    this\r\n\r\nConstitution,  continue to hold those  offices\r\n\r\nor  their seats as Members in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe provisions of this Constitution;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  there is really no contradiction at all  between\r\n\r\nArticle  32 (b)  and Article 96. Until this  Assembly\r\n\r\nis dissolved, everyone who is still a Member of this\r\n\r\nAssembly remains a Member. I hope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  will  meet the objection raised by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in reference to Article 33 of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Constitution which refers to by-elections,\r\n\r\nour   intention  is  that  this  should  follow  the\r\n\r\nexisting  law relating to the Singapore  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly    Elections.   Whether    the    Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution  will  be adopted  by  this  motion  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  amendments made to this Constitution  will\r\n\r\nbe  forwarded to the United Kingdom Government,  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently   by   an  Order   in   Council,   this\r\n\r\nConstitution will be given the force of law. Tonight\r\n\r\nwe  are debating solely on the merits of this  draft\r\n\r\nConstitution. Even if this Assembly should adopt  or\r\n\r\nchange  this  draft Constitution, by virtue  of  the\r\n\r\nfact that it has been through this Assembly, it does\r\n\r\nnot  give  itself the force of law.  It  has  to  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted,  with  any  amendments,  to  the   United\r\n\r\nKingdom Government which will then make an Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil  after  which the Constitution  will  become\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysia Bill itself is not debated here in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber.  It will be debated  in  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament.

That was two\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  The  fruit of their  treachery  was  an\r\n\r\nexultant Member for Anson who, if you will remember,\r\n\r\nSir,  reappeared  in  this Chamber  with  shouts  of\r\n\r\n\"Merdeka\". He did not know then that he  was  but  a\r\n\r\npolitical  flea in the Barisan fur. He  was  brought\r\n\r\ninto   this  Chamber  by  his  hosts,  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. Now that his hosts are about to  die,  the\r\n\r\nflea  in the Barisan fur must either find a new host\r\n\r\nor face slow starvation himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, thanks to the treachery of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and their Communist  mentors,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, it is true, was in a difficult position.\r\n\r\nHad  it  been weak, had it lacked moral courage,  it\r\n\r\ncould  have compromised with the pro-Communist anti-merger  elements, and carried on with a  comfortable\r\n\r\nmajority. If, as the Barisan Sosialis claim  and  as\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A. claim today, the P.A.P. were interested\r\n\r\nonly  in  clinging  to power, the  easiest  and  the\r\n\r\nsimplest  thing to do would have been to  play  ball\r\n\r\nwith the anti-national and anti-merger elements  and\r\n\r\nso  assured ourselves of a comfortable majority. But\r\n\r\nthe price we would have to pay would be betrayal  of\r\n\r\nmerger  and  the espousal eventually of an  isolated\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That  was  a price  which  we  were  not\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay,  even to assure  ourselves  of  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable  majority. Though  our  ranks  had  been\r\n\r\ndepleted  by the treachery and betrayal, we  decided\r\n\r\non  20th  July, 1961, to hit back at the  Communists\r\n\r\n- not  because  they were Communists but  because  we\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  the Communists were  out  to  betray\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia. Instead of  being  cowed  and\r\n\r\ndemoralised  by our defeat at Anson, we  decided  on\r\n\r\n20th July, 1961, to take on the Communists and those\r\n\r\nwho  had  been  mesmerised by the myth of  Communist\r\n\r\ninvincibility,  as some of those who  deserted  from\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty  to join the Barisan Sosialis Communist  ranks\r\n\r\nwere, that the non-Communist, democratic Left is not\r\n\r\na  feeble, stupid and bankrupt political force.

If he can now just concentrate on  the\r\n\r\nmotion and the amendment, it will be better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> With due respect, this motion deals\r\n\r\nwith  the  battle for merger, and it  is  necessary,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  show  why  the Member for  Queenstown  has\r\n\r\nbrought in such an amendment, and to show that  this\r\n\r\nis  the culmination of a battle begun two years  ago\r\n\r\nin this Assembly - the battle for merger and Malaysia\r\n\r\n- and  that this motion by the Prime Minister  is  an\r\n\r\nepitaph   which  should  be  put  over  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to show the Communists that once they\r\n\r\nstarted opposing merger and Malaysia to which  their\r\n\r\nParty  was  committed - merger was  the  platform  on\r\n\r\nwhich they were elected, merger was the platform  on\r\n\r\nwhich every P.A.P. Assemblyman was elected - that once\r\n\r\nthey  decided to oppose this essential plan  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's programme, the fight was  on.  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nwanted to show the Communists and their performing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfleas  that  lived off them that the  non-Communist,\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Left  can compete and  win  against  the\r\n\r\nCommunists in the battle for the hearts and minds of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Singapore had been chosen by the\r\n\r\nCommunists  as  their  Yenan for  the  extension  of\r\n\r\nCommunist   power   throughout  Malaysia.   If   the\r\n\r\nCommunists   were   contained   and   paralysed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, then their auxiliaries in the rest of the\r\n\r\nMalaysian   territories  would  also  be   weakened.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir, the Communists on 20th July,  1961,\r\n\r\nmiscalculated when they thought that we  would  take\r\n\r\ntheir  betrayal lying down. They thought that  after\r\n\r\nour  defeat  in Hong Lim and at Anson, we  the  non-Communist  Left  would be too  demoralised  and  too\r\n\r\nfrightened to fight back, is I have said, Sir,  they\r\n\r\nunder-estimated the resilience of the  non-Communist\r\n\r\nLeft.   Far   from  running  away  and  hiding,   we\r\n\r\nreconvened  the  Assembly on 20th  July,  1961,  and\r\n\r\nbrought  in this nine-ward motion of confidence.  It\r\n\r\nwas the Communists who were taken aback by this show\r\n\r\nof  fight. If you will recollect, those who are  now\r\n\r\nin  the Barisan Sosialis, especially the Member  for\r\n\r\nNee  Soon, was pleading with the Government  not  to\r\n\r\nproceed  with this motion of confidence.  They  were\r\n\r\nnot  yet  quite ready for a showdown with  the  non-Communist  Left. They were hoping still to  stay  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and in the Party in  an  effort  to\r\n\r\ncapture them both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, despite their pleas not to\r\n\r\nproceed  with the motion of confidence, we  insisted\r\n\r\non  a  vote being taken on the motion of confidence.\r\n\r\nWhat   happened,   Sir?  - the  first   defeat,   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  abstained! They were forced out  of  the\r\n\r\nParty   and  the  Government  to  form  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  That  was how the battle for  merger  was\r\n\r\nstarted in this Assembly two years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From then on, Sir, it was a relentless battle\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Communists  and  the  democratic  non-Communist  Left. The issue was merger and  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nToday  looking back, the more intelligent Communists\r\n\r\nrealise  that  the major blunder they  made  was  in\r\n\r\nmaking merger and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysia  the  issue on which to try their  strength\r\n\r\nwith  the  non-Communist Left. That was their  first\r\n\r\nmajor blunder - first betrayal - and secondly, testing\r\n\r\ntheir  strength with the non-Communist Left  on  the\r\n\r\nissue of merger and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had they been more intelligent, had they not\r\n\r\nallowed  their thinking to be distorted by infantile\r\n\r\nslogans,  they could have slowed down  the  pace  of\r\n\r\nmerger  and Malaysia not by resisting merger but  by\r\n\r\nenthusiastically coming out in support of merger and\r\n\r\nMalaysia. We, for our own part, had conic to the conclusion   that   for  a  variety  of   reasons   the\r\n\r\nCommunists, though theoretically supporting  merger,\r\n\r\nin fact, were not in favour of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But many of the Federation leaders had been\r\n\r\ninclined  to  view  merger as a  necessary  part  of\r\n\r\nCommunist  strategy to take over Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation.   That   is   why   Federation   leaders\r\n\r\nrepeatedly said that there would be no merger within\r\n\r\nthe  foreseeable future, because they believed  that\r\n\r\nmerger  was  a  Communist threat to  take  over  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Though we believed otherwise,  we  could\r\n\r\nnot  hope  to  convince the Federation leaders  that\r\n\r\nmerger  was  not, in fact, in the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists, it was not part of their strategy.  They\r\n\r\nhad  decided on some other strategy. Therefore, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  only  people who could convince the  Federation\r\n\r\nleaders of the correctness of our analysis were  the\r\n\r\nCommunists themselves - the Barisan Sosialis. And that\r\n\r\nis  what the Communists and the Barisan Sosialis did\r\n\r\nfor  us.  They  helped  to convince  the  Federation\r\n\r\nleaders  that  merger  was not a  Communist  threat.\r\n\r\nRemember,  Sir, when the Tunku first  announced  his\r\n\r\nproposal  for  merger and Malaysia,  the  Communists\r\n\r\nobliged  by  openly  coming  out  in  opposition  to\r\n\r\nmerger.  They  further obliged us  by  carrying  the\r\n\r\nopposition  to merger and Malaysia by betraying  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. candidate in favour of the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nwho was opposed to merger and who was a long time an\r\n\r\nadvocate  of  an  independent  Singapore  under  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of the United Nations. In  other  words,\r\n\r\nSir,  not  only  were the Barisan Sosialis  able  to\r\n\r\nconvince the Federation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders, but the Communists also provided proof that\r\n\r\nthey  were opposed to merger, not only verbally  but\r\n\r\nthey  were also prepared to go to any extent to halt\r\n\r\nmerger.  Therefore, Sir, by their  betrayal  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. candidate  - it  is  ironical,  Sir,  poetic\r\n\r\njustice - the Communists provided convincing proof of\r\n\r\nour  thesis  that  they were, in  fact,  opposed  to\r\n\r\nmerger  and  that  merger  was  not  a  plan  for  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  take-over. Therefore, the more  violently\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  fought merger, the more  enthusiasm\r\n\r\nwas generated in the Federation for merger. The more\r\n\r\nthey  shouted, \"No merger,\" the more the  Federation\r\n\r\nleaders  were convinced that if merger was not  good\r\n\r\nfor   the  Communists,  it  must  be  good  for  the\r\n\r\nFederation. In other words, Sir, without wanting to,\r\n\r\nbut  by their own stupidity, the Communists and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis accelerated the pace of merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  They  became the unwitting  catalysts  of\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia. And so, Sir, we have planned to\r\n\r\ngive Malaysia Medals on 31st August. [Laughter]  And\r\n\r\nwe  are printing a special Medal out of tin for  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  At  least  without  wanting  to,\r\n\r\nwithout  knowing  it, they also contributed  towards\r\n\r\nthe realisation of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know when the Communists will come to\r\n\r\nwrite   their  history  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis'\r\n\r\ncontribution to the Communist cause, but I am  quite\r\n\r\nsure, Sir, that the bones of the Barisan will be dug\r\n\r\nup and re-buried elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this was only one of the many blunders they\r\n\r\nmade during the course of the battle for merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia. They blundered, Sir, not because they  are\r\n\r\nintrinsically  stupid  but  because  they  made  the\r\n\r\ninitial  mistake of opposing what was  \"historically\r\n\r\ninevitable\".  This is a phrase which all  Communists\r\n\r\nconstantly  use.  Fortunately for  us,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis tried very hard to be good Communists,  but\r\n\r\nthey   are   the   biggest  fumblers  of   Communist\r\n\r\ntechniques and blunderers on behalf of the Communist\r\n\r\ncause  in  Singapore and in Malaya.  They  blundered\r\n\r\nbecause   they   opposed   what   was   historically\r\n\r\ninevitable.  We told them so during  the  debate  on\r\n\r\n20th  July,  1961.  We warned  them  that  they  had\r\n\r\nembarked on a course of action which would land  the\r\n\r\nCommunists and the Barisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSosialis Assemblymen in disaster. At that time, they\r\n\r\nwere  confident.  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong  was  still\r\n\r\nrunning  around;  Mr  James Puthucheary  was  still\r\n\r\nrunning  around.  At  that time,  they  laughed  and\r\n\r\ncheered.  They  said,  \"No,\" and  that  we  will  be\r\n\r\nburied.  Sir,  today this 200-word motion  that  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has moved will, as I said,  Sir,  be\r\n\r\nthe  epitaph that will preface the impending  demise\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis. Two years ago, many of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Members opposite, mesmerised by the\r\n\r\nmyth of Communist invincibility, deserted the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfor  the Communist camp, because they never for  one\r\n\r\nmoment  believed that the non-Communist  Left  would\r\n\r\nhave the stamina, the courage or the intelligence to\r\n\r\noutwit  and circumscribe the Communists,  and  bring\r\n\r\nthe  battle  for merger and Malaysia to a victorious\r\n\r\nconclusion.  They  saw, on the other  hand,  in  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Communist Party a movement built and  forged\r\n\r\nover  a  period of 30 years or more. They saw behind\r\n\r\nit   the   resources,  experience  and  organisation\r\n\r\naccumulated  over  many  decades.  As  against   the\r\n\r\nM.C.P., therefore, they saw what they believed to be\r\n\r\na  young non-Communist Left-wing movement whose only\r\n\r\nvirtue  was that their supporters firmly believe  in\r\n\r\ntheir non-Communism, in merger and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

They believed  that  the\r\n\r\nyoung non-Communist Left-wing movement could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  take on a powerful experienced M.C.P. with  30\r\n\r\nyears  of  experience,  organisation  and  resources\r\n\r\nbehind  it.  The  Communists,  by  intimidation,  by\r\n\r\npressure  of  all  kinds, and by  carefully  staging\r\n\r\ndemonstrations  and  mass  support, convinced   the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Members opposite  that  they  were\r\n\r\nriding on the wave of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, two years after the commencement of the\r\n\r\nbattle  for  merger and Malaysia,  we  of  the  non-Communist Left managed to shatter the illusion  that\r\n\r\nthe  Communists have the masses behind them  in  the\r\n\r\nbattle for merger and Malaysia. It took a long  time\r\n\r\nto  convince  the Barisan Sosialis confrontationists\r\n\r\nthat,  in  embarking upon this dangerous  course  of\r\n\r\nopposing what was historically inevitable, they were\r\n\r\nin  grave  peril  of  being disowned  by  their  own\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referendum was the first occasion which exposed\r\n\r\nthe  Communist lie that they have the masses  behind\r\n\r\nthem  in the battle against merger and Malaysia.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  Barisan Sosialis  are  now  trying  to\r\n\r\nexplain  away  their  defeat at  the  referendum  by\r\n\r\nclaiming  that the referendum was rigged.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown spent the best part of the\r\n\r\nevening  trying  to show that the referendum  proved\r\n\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Member for Queenstown, and since the\r\n\r\nMember  for Thomson seems to echo the voice  of  his\r\n\r\nboss,  or  rather their second-rate script  writers,\r\n\r\nwhy, if the Member for Queenstown believed that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  was rigged and he had evidence,  did  he\r\n\r\nnot  take  steps  to challenge the  verdict  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum in the courts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, why, if the referendum was rigged, did Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching Siong, just before the counting began  at\r\n\r\nthe  Badminton Hall, tell the newspapers that he was\r\n\r\npretty  confident  that the  vast  majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  would cast blank votes? If he believed  that\r\n\r\nthe  referendum  was rigged why  did  he  make  this\r\n\r\nprediction that the blank votes would out-number the\r\n\r\nvotes for merger and Malaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, if the Communists believed that the\r\n\r\nreferendum was rigged, why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  did  their  cohort of school boys  and  school\r\n\r\ngirls gather outside the Badminton Hall with banners\r\n\r\nand   fire-crackers  to  celebrate  the  anticipated\r\n\r\nvictory  of the anti-Malaysia forces over  the  pro-Malaysia   forces?

Again,\r\n\r\nwhy,  after  the  results were  announced,  did  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown and  his  friends  demand  a\r\n\r\nrecount?   Surely,  if  the  Member  for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  the referendum had been  rigged,  he\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  asked for a  recount  of  what  he\r\n\r\nclaimed to be a rigged referendum?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I quote one authority as to the honesty of the\r\n\r\nreferendum,  which  I  know  the  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\nconfrontationists dared not contradict? Because even\r\n\r\nin Indonesia the referendum results in Singapore had\r\n\r\nnever  been  questioned. A number of  its  spokesmen\r\n\r\nhave  conceded, whatever may be the case  elsewhere,\r\n\r\nthat  the  referendum in Singapore  has  shown  that\r\n\r\nthere is popular support in Singapore for merger and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.

Every\r\n\r\ntime the Communists describe merger and Malaysia  as\r\n\r\na  sell-out, as the Member for Queenstown  did  for\r\n\r\nthe  best part of one evening and one afternoon, and\r\n\r\nthe  referendum  as  phoney, they  only  succeed  in\r\n\r\nhelping to consolidate the 72 per cent of the people\r\n\r\nwho  voted  for the White Paper.

So  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown can keep on saying  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum is phoney, the referendum is rigged,  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  is dishonest, but the 72  per  cent  who\r\n\r\nwent  to put their crosses on the ballot papers  for\r\n\r\nAlternative A know what they did, why they did;  and\r\n\r\nevery time the Member for Queenstown and the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis keep on trying to put forward this  slogan,\r\n\r\nthey are helping to consolidate the 72 per cent.

He castigated them  bitterly,  for\r\n\r\nwhich  there  was no reply, no come-back,  from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. He castigated them  bitterly  for\r\n\r\nhaving  fallen into what he called a political  trap\r\n\r\nby  the decision to campaign for blank votes with  a\r\n\r\nlong virulent editorial against the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nfor  having  fallen into a political trap  by  their\r\n\r\ndecision  to  campaign for blank votes, because  - he\r\n\r\ndid  not  say so but it was quite clear, if we  read\r\n\r\nbetween  the lines - by this blunder on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis and their advisers, the Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist movement, or the Malayan Communists,  were\r\n\r\nfor  the  first  time  put in a position  where  the\r\n\r\ncarefully  prefabricated  myth  that  they  had  the\r\n\r\nmasses  behind them could be effectively  challenged\r\n\r\nand  destroyed  in  a straight constitutional  fight\r\n\r\nbetween the democratic non-Communist forces and  the\r\n\r\npro-Communists. The Communists had never, ever,  put\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  a  position where they  had  to  try\r\n\r\nconstitutional  strength between the  Communist  and\r\n\r\nnon-Communist forces. They have either fought for it\r\n\r\non a united front basis or on some basis kept out of\r\n\r\nelections  altogether. But this was the first  time,\r\n\r\nthanks  to  the  blunder  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nleaders,  that the Communists were put in a position\r\n\r\nof  having  to  try its strength in a constitutional\r\n\r\nfight between the non-Communist forces and the  pro-Communists.  The  Communists had been  trapped  into\r\n\r\ncampaigning  for blank votes because  they  believed\r\n\r\nthat   the   blank  votes  would  not   be   counted\r\n\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think even the Member for Hong Lim - he is a\r\n\r\nlittle   bit  shrewder  than  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nleaders   - also  thought  that  they  had  possibly,\r\n\r\nincluding  himself, fallen into a trap, because  the\r\n\r\nblank  votes  would  show the  extent  of  Communist\r\n\r\ninfluence, and votes for the White Paper would  show\r\n\r\nthe extent of non-Communist influence in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blank votes were, in fact, counted separately,\r\n\r\nand  less than 25 per cent of the electors - and that\r\n\r\npredominantly   in  the  rural   areas   - could   be\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by the Communists as at September  1962.\r\n\r\nIt   is  very  important,  Sir.  On  that  day,  the\r\n\r\nStatistics  showed  the  organised  might   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  showed a few opportunist  like  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim and the Member for Anson that at\r\n\r\nthe  most  they could mobilise or influence  25  per\r\n\r\ncent of the electors, and that, again, predominantly\r\n\r\nin  the  rural areas where what they call the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nradio  and  P.A.P. television could  not  reach  the\r\n\r\nmasses.  That  is  an  omission which  was  speedily\r\n\r\nrectified. But as at September 1962, throughout  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  Singapore,  the  Communists  could   only\r\n\r\nmislead 25 per cent of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, the myth of Communist mass\r\n\r\ninfluence  has been effectively destroyed.  For  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  the people of Singapore  realised  with\r\n\r\nrelief  and  joy  that  the  Communist  movement  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the so-called citadel of  the  Communist\r\n\r\nmovement  in  Malaysia, the Yennan of  Malaysia  was\r\n\r\nafter all a giant with feet of clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1947, the Communists, with clever\r\n\r\norganisational technique, such as carefully arranged\r\n\r\nand  disciplined mass meetings of 30,000 and  40,000\r\n\r\npeople, the manipulation of unions by staging  riots\r\n\r\nand  engineering violence between police and  school\r\n\r\nchildren,  the Communists had built up an  image  of\r\n\r\nirresistible   strength  and  unchallengeable   mass\r\n\r\ninfluence. This image helped the Communists  to  cow\r\n\r\nand  neutralise large numbers of people  who  feared\r\n\r\nthem,  who  feared  their  strength  and  who   were\r\n\r\ntherefore  not  prepared to show their  disagreement\r\n\r\nwith   Communist  policies.  Therefore,   when   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  began  the  battle  against  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  hoped  to  capitalise on  this  image  of  the\r\n\r\ninvincible,  powerful,  and  irresistible  Communist\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the referendum became, thanks to the stupidity\r\n\r\nof  the Karl Marxists and Change Alley Lenins in the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  a  straight  trial  of  strength\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Communists  and  the  democratic  non-Communists. We broke the spell, for the first  time,\r\n\r\nof    Communist   invincibility   and   irresistible\r\n\r\ninfluence in Singapore. We are proud that we of  the\r\n\r\nnon-Communist  Left who, two years  ago,  when  they\r\n\r\ndeserted us, were in a difficult situation, who have\r\n\r\nbeen  reviled  by  the Barisan Sosialis  as  feeble,\r\n\r\nvacillating  and purposeless social democrats,  have\r\n\r\nhelped    to   break   the   Communist   spell    of\r\n\r\ninvincibility.   If  for  no  other   reason,   Sir,\r\n\r\nwhatever happens to us, we shall be satisfied  that\r\n\r\nwe  in the P.A.P. have been able for the first  time\r\n\r\nin  30 years to break the myth, the humbug that  the\r\n\r\nCommunists are invincible. This achievement of  ours\r\n\r\nis something to contribute to the cause of democracy\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. For nothing else, even if our  houses\r\n\r\nand  factories are discounted, this one  achievement\r\n\r\nof  ours,  that after 30 years we have proved  in  a\r\n\r\nstraight  constitutional fight  that  the  Communist\r\n\r\nmyth  of  invincibility is hollow, empty, a lie,  is\r\n\r\nsomething.  And  as a result of the  referendum,  we\r\n\r\nhave  freed the people of Singapore from their  fear\r\n\r\nof  the  Communists. It was fear, intimidation,  the\r\n\r\nbelief  that if you oppose the Communists they  will\r\n\r\ncome back to power and settle scores with you. And I\r\n\r\nhave  some photographs here which I will show  later\r\n\r\non  which will show that for the first time  we  had\r\n\r\nthe   people  of  Singapore  laughing,  jeering  and\r\n\r\ncheering  at the Communists. That is what  happened,\r\n\r\nSir.  But  that  is a thing which I  shall  come  to\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

[Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have helped to instil in the people of Singapore\r\n\r\na  new confidence and a new hope through the success\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbattle   for   merger  and  Malaysia   against   the\r\n\r\nopposition of the Communists. We have convinced  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  if the non-Communist majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  united, they can defeat the  Communists\r\n\r\nand  their brainless stooges any time, anywhere.  At\r\n\r\nleast  that is the little contribution we have  made\r\n\r\nto  the cause of democracy, to the cause of national\r\n\r\nsolidarity in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, the Change Alley Lenins in the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis realise today that the  referendum\r\n\r\nwas  the  beginning of the end for them.  They  know\r\n\r\nthat  the referendum was their death sentence.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  - they cannot explain it away - they have  to\r\n\r\nkeep  on repeating the falsehood that the referendum\r\n\r\nwas rigged, that it was not a true indication of the\r\n\r\npeople's wishes. They are doing this not in order to\r\n\r\nwin  over  the  72 per cent who have refused  to  be\r\n\r\ninfluenced by them. That is not their purpose.  They\r\n\r\nknow  that.  They are repeating this falsehood  that\r\n\r\nthe  referendum was rigged in order to retain  their\r\n\r\nwavering hold over the 25 per cent whom they  misled\r\n\r\ninto  casting blank votes. That is the purpose,  not\r\n\r\nbecause  of winning over the 72 per cent. They  know\r\n\r\nthey  have  lost. They can never win them over.  But\r\n\r\nnow  they have to preserve the 25 per cent whom they\r\n\r\nhave  misled. It is no longer a question, as far  as\r\n\r\nthe    Barisan   Sosialis   confrontationists    are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  of  their winning more converts  but  of\r\n\r\nholding  on  to the little they have.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, therefore, Sir, after the referendum, even if\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis Back-benches do not  know  it\r\n\r\ntoday,  but  the  people who  do  a  little  bit  of\r\n\r\nthinking in the Barisan Sosialis knew that after the\r\n\r\nSeptember  referendum,  the battle  for  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  took on a new phase. It was now  a  battle\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Communists and the non-Communist  Left\r\n\r\nfor  the  hearts and minds of the 25 per cent.  That\r\n\r\nwas  the battle, not for the 72 per cent but for the\r\n\r\n25  per cent. So long as the 72 per cent of the non-Communist votes remain united and not split by  non-Communist adventurers in search of loot and prey, we\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P. are convinced that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan detach a substantial part of the 25 per cent the\r\n\r\nCommunists  deluded,  and we  can  do  this  not  by\r\n\r\nbullets, unless, of course, the Communists and their\r\n\r\nstooges in the Barisan Sosialis in their desperation\r\n\r\ntake  to  sticks, stones, broken bottles  and  hand-grenades.  If they do not do that, we can  win  over\r\n\r\n- not  by bullets but by ballots - a substantial  part\r\n\r\nof  the 25 per cent, detach the 25 per cent from the\r\n\r\nCommunists     and     the     Barisan      Sosialis\r\n\r\nconfrontationists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that the tin-pot Lenins in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis are not as perky as they  were\r\n\r\ntwo  years ago when, following the betrayal of their\r\n\r\nown  Party at Anson, they triumphantly led into this\r\n\r\nChamber  the  Member for Anson. For two years,  they\r\n\r\nprophesied  disaster for us if we persisted  in  our\r\n\r\nbattle for merger and Malaysia. \"The day will come,\"\r\n\r\nthey  said,  \"when the masses will  be  chasing  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders down the street.\" Then there came the\r\n\r\nday  when  the Member for Nee Soon came clean-shaven\r\n\r\nto  this  Chamber, and I knew then  that,  like  the\r\n\r\nBiblical  Samson  whose strength lay  in  his  hair,\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  fight left in the Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nThat was purely a symbol of what was going on in the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and the state of their minds.  They\r\n\r\nknew then - and they know it now - that it is they who\r\n\r\nwill  one  day have to run away from the masses  and\r\n\r\npossibly   seek  refuge  in  islands   outside   the\r\n\r\nterritorial  jurisdiction  of  Malaysia  after  31st\r\n\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\nQuite right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> This is no wild prophecy, Sir. One\r\n\r\nthing  that the Barisan Sosialis cannot hold against\r\n\r\nus  is that our predictions and warnings - purely  to\r\n\r\nhelp them out - have not come true. We have said that\r\n\r\ncome what may there will be Malaysia, as sure as the\r\n\r\nsun  rises.  It is true that when last Thursday  the\r\n\r\nopportunist  Right-wing  S.P.A. together  with  the\r\n\r\nMembers  for Anson, Joo Chiat and the U.P.P. ganged\r\n\r\nup  to  defeat  the  Bill for the elections  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral    Parliament   and   forced   a   premature\r\n\r\nresignation of the Government, the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers were filled with hope -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> What is wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - that Malaysia may not after all\r\n\r\ncome  about. I was told that during tea-time on that\r\n\r\nday  the  Member  for Anson, to the delight  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, was telling everyone that  he  was\r\n\r\nwaiting   for  the  kill  that  night.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Members, I was told, were  prancing  about\r\n\r\nthe  corridors  of  this Chamber besides  themselves\r\n\r\nwith  joy. That was on Thursday. Today is Wednesday.\r\n\r\nThere has been no kill. The Government is very  much\r\n\r\nalive  and  kicking and more than somewhat cheerful.\r\n\r\nBut not so the Opposition United Front, and least of\r\n\r\nall  the paper matadors who were poised for the kill\r\n\r\non  Thursday.  What  happened  is  that  while  they\r\n\r\nflourished  their cloaks and swished  their  swords,\r\n\r\nthey  got gored from behind. There will be no  kill,\r\n\r\nSir.  There  will  be merger and  Malaysia  by  31st\r\n\r\nAugust,  however much the Opposition  may  gang  up.\r\n\r\nSir, if it is any consolation to the Opposition, and\r\n\r\nto  the Barisan Sosialis in particular, I would like\r\n\r\nto  tell  them  now  that the Government  is  making\r\n\r\nintensive preparations to proclaim Malaysia  not  on\r\n\r\n31st  August, as originally scheduled,  but  at  the\r\n\r\nstroke  of midnight on 30th August. Sir, if for  two\r\n\r\nyears the Communists failed to halt progress towards\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  this  last-minute - I think  the  term  is\r\n\r\n\"bundling\":  I  am  told  it  is  a  bundling   bed;\r\n\r\neverybody  gets  it - bundling of the Right-wing  and\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis in the same bed will not  rock\r\n\r\nthe Malaysia Boat before 31st August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of merger and Malaysia - one of the\r\n\r\nmiscalculations  made by both the  Barisan  and  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  - will not be decided today  by  mutations\r\n\r\nand  permutations in the Opposition  ranks  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Ninety-five per cent of  the  battle  for\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia  was fought  not  within  this\r\n\r\nAssembly hut outside. That is where the S.P.A.,  the\r\n\r\nU.P.P. and  the  Members for Anson  and  Joo  Chiat\r\n\r\nmiscalculated  when they thought  they  could  panic\r\n\r\nthis  Government by ganging up against it with cries\r\n\r\nof  \"Resign\". Merger and Malaysia will come about on\r\n\r\n31st\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust, because the battle for Malaysia has been won\r\n\r\noutside  this Assembly, and it will not  come  about\r\n\r\nbecause of any fear, one way or the other, from this\r\n\r\nAssembly, but because last September, 72 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe people said that they wanted merger on the basis\r\n\r\nof the White Paper, not the complete merger as first\r\n\r\nrequested by the Barisan Sosialis and the U.P.P. and\r\n\r\nthen   abandoned  for  merger  on  terms   no   less\r\n\r\nfavourable   than  those  granted  to   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  as  first requested by the  S.P.A. and\r\n\r\nthen  abandoned  by them, but on the  basis  of  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper. This, Sir, is the simple fact that  was\r\n\r\noverlooked  by  the Member for Queenstown  while  he\r\n\r\ngroaned  and  groaned his way through  the  sort  of\r\n\r\nincoherent prose that is normally heard  only  on  a\r\n\r\npsychoanalyst  couch. He talks  of  the  people.  He\r\n\r\nalways keeps on talking about the people, the people\r\n\r\nwanting that, the people being opposed to merger and\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  the  people  having  lost  faith  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.? But which people is he talking about? Is  he\r\n\r\ntalking about the S.P.A. Journal which goes  by  the\r\n\r\nname  \"The People\"? Is he talking about the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  people? I agree that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\npeople  who  for the most part consist of bony-kneed\r\n\r\nschool  boys  and youths and pig-tailed lassies  are\r\n\r\nagainst  merger and Malaysia. True, these  befuddled\r\n\r\nand  hysterical juveniles put up black  banners  and\r\n\r\npossibly  black  underpants to mourn the  inevitable\r\n\r\nadvent  of merger and Malaysia. These are the people\r\n\r\nyou  see  them  running around in pig  tails,  short\r\n\r\npants; I understand, Sir, that new orders have  gone\r\n\r\nout  that they should wear long pants, cut off their\r\n\r\npig  tails, have permanent wave - probably  the  bee-hive  - so that the people will say that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nhas  now  the support of mature people - the  workers.\r\n\r\n[Interruption]  I  might be crazy,  Sir,  but  these\r\n\r\nGentlemen,  as far as I can see, are in  a  position\r\n\r\nwhere  they will go crazy slowly. If the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  thinks that the people are  the  72  per\r\n\r\ncent  who voted for merger and Malaysia or even  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  numbers in the rural areas  who  since  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's visits of explanations realise that\r\n\r\nthey have been misled by the Barisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSosialis  falsehoods,  then I  am  afraid  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and the Member for Queenstown  are\r\n\r\ncompletely  off  the mark. The  truth  is  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and  the Communists  have  become\r\n\r\nobjects  of  contempt and ridicule among the  people\r\n\r\ntoday,  and the Communists and the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nknow  it.  That is why the Barisan Sosialis  Members\r\n\r\nopposite  have lost their bounce and confidence.  It\r\n\r\nis  an open secret that the more far-sighted Members\r\n\r\nin   the   Barisan   Sosialis   are   today   making\r\n\r\npreparations to give up politics after 31st  August,\r\n\r\neither  to  take  up higher studies abroad,  or  run\r\n\r\nprawn farms -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Are you thinking too?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> - and one Member of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  told the Minister for Health and Law  that\r\n\r\nshe is going to buy and sell second-hand cars.

I wish they had  done  it\r\n\r\nsooner, but with 30 days more to 31st August, it  is\r\n\r\nstill  not too late. I approve of people going  into\r\n\r\nthe  prawn farm business or even selling second-hand\r\n\r\ncars  or  even share-broking, because it means  that\r\n\r\nmany  of  them  secretly believe that Malaysia  will\r\n\r\nbring  prosperity in which they too  would  like  to\r\n\r\nhave  a share. Whether they do so or not will depend\r\n\r\non  whether between now and 31st August they  embark\r\n\r\nupon newer, more foolish, still madder misadventures\r\n\r\nlike  storming  the  City Hall or  possibly  staging\r\n\r\nminor confrontations of their own in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, many Barisan Sosialis Members are not\r\n\r\nparticularly  impressed or convinced by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Queenstown's  affirmation  and  re-affirmation\r\n\r\nyesterday  and today that the Ban-san  Sosialis  and\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  have  the  people  behind  them.  I\r\n\r\nwatched  them very closely yesterday and I  got  the\r\n\r\nimpression that they did not believe a word of  what\r\n\r\ntheir leader was saying [Interruption]. Many of them\r\n\r\ndrifted  in  and out. In fact, Sir,  you  will  have\r\n\r\nnoticed that when the Member for Queenstown's  voice\r\n\r\nrose  to  an oratorical crescendo about the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving  the masses behind them in this fight against\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia,  not  once  were  there   any\r\n\r\nsupporting  noises  from the Barisan  Sosialis  Back\r\n\r\nBenches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, the Minister must realise\r\n\r\nthat unseemingly noises in this Assembly are out  of\r\n\r\norder.

The number of events  during\r\n\r\nthe  last few weeks in Singapore have made it  clear\r\n\r\nto  the  Barisan  Sosialis that  their  Party  is  a\r\n\r\npolitical  dead  duck  and  that  they  have  become\r\n\r\nobjects  of  open  derision and contempt  among  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Yes,  Sir, unlike two years  ago  when  the\r\n\r\npeople  dared  not  laugh at the  Communists  openly\r\n\r\nbecause   they  were  mesmerised  by  the  myth   of\r\n\r\nCommunist  power, today the people are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nlaugh and boo at the Communists openly and publicly.\r\n\r\nThis happened at Hong Lim on the 14th July when  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister held a mass meeting immediately after\r\n\r\nhis  return  from London after signing the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement.  Not far from the park, Sir,  the  second\r\n\r\nbranch of the Communist-controlled Singapore General\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union displayed black banners  to  mourn\r\n\r\nwhat  they  called `the selling-out of the  people's\r\n\r\nrights under the Malaysia Agreement'. It is strange,\r\n\r\nSir,  that thousands and thousands of people  should\r\n\r\nhave  lined  the streets, fired crackers  and  built\r\n\r\narches  to cheer and congratulate the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nfor \"selling them out.\" It is very strange that they\r\n\r\nshould have lined the streets, shaken his hands  and\r\n\r\ncheered  him  for selling them out. But  there  were\r\n\r\nthousands of people at Hong Lim Park on that  night.\r\n\r\nDuring  the course of his speech, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ndrew the attention of the crowd to the black banners\r\n\r\nput up by professional mourners of the second branch\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore  General  Employees'  Union.  The\r\n\r\nbanners  were  lighted  up and  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nthought that he would do the professional mourners a\r\n\r\nfavour  by  giving  them  their  banners  additional\r\n\r\npublicity. Since he was on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  T.V. and the radio, he wanted to read  out  the\r\n\r\nobituary  message  on  the  black  banners  so  that\r\n\r\nhundreds  and thousands of radio listeners and  T.V.\r\n\r\nviewers could know what the Communists were mourning\r\n\r\nfor - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M.

Sir, since the  black\r\n\r\nbanners  were some distance away, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhad some difficulty reading the words and I expected\r\n\r\nthe  S.G.E.U. mourners to turn on more lights on the\r\n\r\nbanners  so that the Prime Minister could read  what\r\n\r\nwas  written  there and relay the message.  Instead,\r\n\r\nthe lights went off suddenly to the astonishment  of\r\n\r\nthe  thousands of people assembled at the  park  and\r\n\r\nthe  T.V. cameras picked it up all. Not only did the\r\n\r\nlights  go off and the black banners were hidden  in\r\n\r\ndarkness but the crowds were even more astonished to\r\n\r\nsee  the  youthful mourners of the S.G.E.U. premises\r\n\r\nscooting  for their lives. Here are the  people  who\r\n\r\nproclaim  that they have the masses behind them,  to\r\n\r\nthe right of them, to the left of them, running away\r\n\r\nlike frightened rabbits before the masses. This  was\r\n\r\nseen  by  The  crowds and picked by  the  television\r\n\r\ncamera  and  relayed, I hope, throughout the  length\r\n\r\nand  breadth of Singapore. All because of what, Sir?\r\n\r\nBecause the Prime Minister, whom the Communists have\r\n\r\nsaid is afraid of the masses, had wanted to read out\r\n\r\nfor  the  benefit of the audience and the radio  and\r\n\r\nT.V. listeners  what  the Communist  black  banners\r\n\r\nsaid.  All  he  was trying to do was to  do  them  a\r\n\r\nfavour,  and  they  scooted. No  wonder  before  the\r\n\r\nastonishing spectacle of Communist stooges  doing  a\r\n\r\nbunk  before the eyes of the people that the  crowds\r\n\r\nat  first laughed and then booed. Then they  cheered -\r\n\r\nnot  the Barisan, Sir. For the first time in a  long\r\n\r\nwhile,  a  crowd of ordinary people  who  have  been\r\n\r\nconditioned to maintain a respectful silence  before\r\n\r\nthe Communists and their stooges were able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  laugh and see the Communist stooges scooting for\r\n\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the battle that began two years ago, the magic\r\n\r\nspell  of  Communist strength and invincibility  has\r\n\r\nbeen irrevocably broken. A figure of fear had, after\r\n\r\ntwo  years  of protracted struggle over  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  become a popular figure of fun,  just  as\r\n\r\ntoday  the Member for Queenstown and his cohorts  in\r\n\r\nthis   Assembly  have  become.  Even  his   marathon\r\n\r\nspeeches  in  this  Assembly, a hitter  and  massive\r\n\r\ncompendium of all the speeches he has made  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly   during  the  last  few   years,   despite\r\n\r\neditorials   from   the  Barisan  Sosialis'   Orient\r\n\r\nExpress, the impromptu flow of the unconscious,  all\r\n\r\nthis  too, today, have become a figure of  fun.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that  today an ordinary crowd can  openly  and\r\n\r\npublicly  dare to laugh at the Barisan Sosialis  and\r\n\r\ntheir   Communist   cohorts  constitutes   a   major\r\n\r\npsychological  and political victory  for  the  non-Communist  democratic forces. In  the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nmasses, the Barisan Sosialis is not a Marxist outfit\r\n\r\nbut  an  outfit  of  Marx Brothers - Groucho,  Harpo,\r\n\r\nChico and Siew Choh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, last Saturday, there occurred an event\r\n\r\nat Jalan Besar which proved beyond a shadow of doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the myth of Communist invincibility, Communist\r\n\r\nprestige,   Communist  might,   had   been   utterly\r\n\r\ndestroyed.  The  people have  been  purged  of  this\r\n\r\ndangerous  fear  of Communist power  and  influence.\r\n\r\nJalan Besar is a Communist stronghold. It is one  of\r\n\r\ntheir  major  hunting grounds. There  is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nunions  around  there, Sir. The humiliation  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  being laughed out of their own  premises\r\n\r\nby  a  crowd.  The biggest humiliation  is  where  a\r\n\r\nperson can be laughed out of his own premises.  They\r\n\r\nwere  high  up,  Sir, so that people  could  not  do\r\n\r\nanything. They were about four or five storeys high.\r\n\r\nBut  they  were still so scared of the  people  that\r\n\r\nthey  ran out. That was the biggest humiliation,  it\r\n\r\nwas  bad enough putting out the lights, running  out\r\n\r\nof your own house, hut worse still, running out of a\r\n\r\nhouse which was beyond the reach of the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, to rectify that humiliation, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and the Communists wanted to retrieve their\r\n\r\nhonour  and  self-respect at  Jalan  Besar.  We  had\r\n\r\nadvanced  information  that  a  number  of   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  unions were making active preparations  to\r\n\r\nboo  and  heckle the Prime Minister, to shout  anti-Malaysia and anti-merger slogans during his tours of\r\n\r\nJalan   Besar,   Kampong  Kapor  and   Farrer   Park\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  They  wanted  to  see   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister run away from the people this time. Some 70\r\n\r\nbeardless  youths and hysterical girls had assembled\r\n\r\nhigh   above   the   Communist-controlled   National\r\n\r\nBuilding Construction Workers Union. They had  fixed\r\n\r\nloud-speakers  to boo and hurl abuse  at  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. Well, Sir, things did not work out the way\r\n\r\nthe  Communists had hoped for. Far from running away\r\n\r\nas  the  Communists  had hoped, the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhalted  his jeep in the midst of thousands of people\r\n\r\nwho  had  assembled  there,  while  from  the  Union\r\n\r\nbuilding  above  draped  with  black  banners,   the\r\n\r\nCommunists shouted how the Prime Minister  had  sold\r\n\r\nout the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Were you there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, I was there.

I was very happy\r\n\r\nthat  I  was  there on that day, to  see  the  final\r\n\r\nhumiliation  of the Communists by the  people,  Sir,\r\n\r\nnot by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Work Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Well, Sir, I will come to that.

Sir, here  were\r\n\r\nthe  people - I think something like 6,000 or  7,000\r\n\r\nordinary people - gathered around the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThere  were  on  one  side the  Communists  shouting\r\n\r\nslogans,  \"Down  with Malaysia!  Sell-out  Malaysia!\r\n\r\nSell-out  merger,\" and there was the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\n- who  is supposed to be disliked by the people,  the\r\n\r\npeople are waiting to hang him from the nearest lamp-post  - standing  in the midst of the crowd,  whereas\r\n\r\nthe \"people's representatives\", the \"men who had the\r\n\r\nmasses behind them\" in a fourth-storey building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Quite easy to jump down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> To be fair, Sir, I must say that\r\n\r\nthough the boys and the girls were covering up their\r\n\r\nfaces,  wearing  masks,  handkerchiefs  - one   thing\r\n\r\nstruck  me, Sir, and I must be fair to the girls.  I\r\n\r\nhad  a  distinct  recollection that the  girls  were\r\n\r\nsomewhat  braver than the boys. At least  the  girls\r\n\r\noccasionally  revealed their faces.  It  is  an  odd\r\n\r\nthing   about  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  that   their\r\n\r\nwomenfolk  are  not only braver than their  menfolk,\r\n\r\nbut they are often delegated to undertake more risky\r\n\r\njobs  like  volunteering for West Irian or  storming\r\n\r\nthe  City Council.

He asked the hysterical youths and\r\n\r\ngirls to send a representative to come down and talk\r\n\r\nto  the  people. He offered them the use of  a  more\r\n\r\nefficient  microphone to explain to the  people  why\r\n\r\nthey thought that the Malaysia Agreement was a sell-out.  The crowd, too, thought that it was a sporting\r\n\r\noffer,  and by cheers urged the Communists to accept\r\n\r\nthe offer. But to the astonishment of the crowd, the\r\n\r\nCommunists  youths,  the Barisan  Sosialis  stooges,\r\n\r\nshowed  great reluctance in coming down  from  their\r\n\r\ngreat  heights to talk to the people.

One thing is that the  pictures\r\n\r\ntaken by the television cameras failed to show  what\r\n\r\nthe  crowd was saying, the noises of the crowd,  the\r\n\r\nanger of the crowd. When the Prime Minister left, he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Here, you can see for yourselves. These  are\r\n\r\nthe  people who want to destroy Malaysia.\" Then  the\r\n\r\ncrowd gave three cheers, three merdekas, and by that\r\n\r\ntime  the  gentlemen,  little boys  and  girls,  had\r\n\r\nvanished  from  the National Union  of  Construction\r\n\r\nWorkers building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is unlike two years ago when they had Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong and a few others to put life  into  the\r\n\r\nParty.  Today, after two years of struggle with  the\r\n\r\nsocial   democrats,  whom  they  had  contemptuously\r\n\r\ndismissed as effete, purposeless elements, it is the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis which is in the process of gradual\r\n\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is my belief that even the Communists, who  will\r\n\r\nsurvive the Barisan Socialist for a long time,  have\r\n\r\nwritten  the  Barisan Sosialis off as a vehicle  for\r\n\r\ntheir purpose. They will make use of it as a vehicle\r\n\r\nwhile  it  still survives, because it  is  the  only\r\n\r\nvehicle   left  for  them  to  manipulate  in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  It  is fairly common knowledge  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, under the nominal  leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Queenstown and his advisers,  have\r\n\r\nbecome an embarrassment to the Communist cause.  His\r\n\r\nfreelancing,  his marathon speeches,  ostensibly  on\r\n\r\nbehalf   of   the  Communist  cause, is   no   mean\r\n\r\ncontribution   towards   bringing   Communism   into\r\n\r\ndisrepute for the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, there was a letter in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers which described the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nas   a   political  lightweight,  what  the   writer\r\n\r\ndescribed  as a sugar plum to decorate  the  Barisan\r\n\r\ncake.  I  would,  I submit, Sir,  to  be  more  apt,\r\n\r\ndescribe  him  as the pickled prune in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\ntrifle.  His performance last Thursday when  he  and\r\n\r\nhis  Party lined up with the S.P.A. and the rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  to  bring down the  Government  was\r\n\r\nanother miscalculation as damaging to the Communists\r\n\r\nas the famous tea-party the Barisan Sosialis leaders\r\n\r\nhad  in Eden Hall. Sir, to be led up the garden path\r\n\r\nby   British   colonialists  has   at   least   this\r\n\r\nconsolation.  At  least  the Barisan  Sosialis  were\r\n\r\noutwitted by the British colonialists with  hundreds\r\n\r\nof  years of experience of State craft and diplomacy\r\n\r\nbehind  them.  But last Thursday to be  led  up  the\r\n\r\ngarden path by the Right-wing Alliance, which is  no\r\n\r\nelectric computer - the S.P.A., we know, were playing\r\n\r\ntheir  own  game, a game on orders from  above.  For\r\n\r\ntheir own reasons, the S.P.A. did not want elections\r\n\r\nto  the  Central Parliament first. So they lined  up\r\n\r\nwith the Barisan Sosialis who thought that here  was\r\n\r\na chance to bring about the immediate resignation of\r\n\r\nthe   Government  and  halt  merger  and   Malaysia.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir,  if  the Barisan Sosialis  and  their\r\n\r\nadvisers had made some careful calculations on  that\r\n\r\nfateful  Thursday afternoon, they would  have  known\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Cairnhill is not the kind of man\r\n\r\nwho is going to do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanything  to  ensure  the survival  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis in the next election. By opposing elections\r\n\r\nto  the  15  seats before 31st August,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have deprived the Communists of a possible\r\n\r\nchance they may have had of winning a few seats even\r\n\r\nif  they  are  only  to be Central  Parliament.  But\r\n\r\nthanks  to  their being led up the garden path,  now\r\n\r\nafter  3lst August the chances of the pro-Communists\r\n\r\nstanding  for  election and  winning  seats  are,  I\r\n\r\nshould  say,  zero. Toe Barisan Sosialis  have  been\r\n\r\nonce  again led up the garden path by - and what must\r\n\r\nbe  most  humiliating is that they should have  been\r\n\r\nled up the garden path by - the Alliance Party, whose\r\n\r\npowers  of  political calculation are  by  no  means\r\n\r\noutstanding.  That is why the Barisan Sosialis,  who\r\n\r\nwere  jubilant  on Thursday evening,  looked  a  bit\r\n\r\ndazed  and  desperate  on the  following  day.  Some\r\n\r\nbright  chaps  must have done some calculations  too\r\n\r\nand  put  one more black mark against the  political\r\n\r\nineptitude  of  the  Member for Queenstown  and  his\r\n\r\nbefuddled  advisers.  It is now  not  a  case  of  a\r\n\r\npickled prune in the Barisan trifle, but the Barisan\r\n\r\ntrifle being in a serious pickle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what then is the immediate future for the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis?  How  can  they  in  these   last\r\n\r\nremaining 30 days hope to halt Malaysia and  merger?\r\n\r\nI  say immediate future because, as I have said,  it\r\n\r\nis only a matter of 30 days before the clock strikes\r\n\r\nmidnight  to Malaysia and the Barisan Sosialis  find\r\n\r\nthemselves in serious trouble. They know today  what\r\n\r\nhappened in Jalan Besar, what the reactions  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  are to their propaganda, to their effort  to\r\n\r\nmount  opposition to Malaysia. They know  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to rally at least 72 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  people in any anti-Malaysia crusade because the\r\n\r\npeople  are  determined  to have  Malaysia,  as  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis also know that Malaysia will  come\r\n\r\nwhatever happens by 31st August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I was slightly amused when I read the\r\n\r\namendment by the Member for Queenstown because, Sir,\r\n\r\nif you will read the amendment carefully, you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill discover that it is a tacit admission that  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper merger terms have the popular backing of\r\n\r\nthe   people.  The  amendment  by  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  and much of his argument were calculated\r\n\r\nto  convey  the  impression that it is  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  who are now really interested in defending\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper merger terms. The  Government  was\r\n\r\ncastigated for departing from the terms of the White\r\n\r\nPaper, apart from the general sell-out of merger and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Sir, the propaganda objective  is  clear.\r\n\r\nSince the Communists cannot halt Malaysia, they hope\r\n\r\nthey can at least capitalise on what they know to be\r\n\r\npopular support for the White Paper by appearing  as\r\n\r\ndefenders of the White Paper, that the P.A.P. which\r\n\r\ndevised  the  White  Paper had  betrayed  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper,  and that the Barisan Sosialis, which opposed\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper, can be relied on  to  defend  the\r\n\r\nterms  of  the White Paper. I do not think all  this\r\n\r\nwill cut any ice with the people who have now learnt\r\n\r\nto  laugh  at them publicly. The people have  become\r\n\r\nmore  sophisticated  and they  have  not  the  least\r\n\r\ndesire  tu  place  the running of this  country  and\r\n\r\nsonic 5400 million worth that the Government has put\r\n\r\nby  the  treasury in the hands of youths and  masked\r\n\r\nschool  girls.  The  Member for Queenstown  and  his\r\n\r\nParty  may  have public rallies of 20,000 or  30,000\r\n\r\nbleating  kids. But as the referendum showed,  these\r\n\r\nmammoth  rallies  of  dedicated followers  will  not\r\n\r\nprevent 72 per cent of the people or more from using\r\n\r\ntheir  intelligence and casting their votes for  the\r\n\r\nright type of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, as I have said, that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis know that their number is up. But they have\r\n\r\nto  keep  up the pretence that they have the  people\r\n\r\nwith  them.  There  is nothing  else  they  can  do.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it is perhaps essential, now that  we  are\r\n\r\nreaching  the final stages of the battle for  merger\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia, to indicate the real danger,  or  the\r\n\r\nmore  dangerous role, the last and final role,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  will play  before  they  are\r\n\r\nfinally eliminated from the political scene.  It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  people of Singapore  to  become\r\n\r\naware of what potential danger can emanate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the Barisan Sosialis. As far as the people  and\r\n\r\nthe workers of Singapore are concerned, they will get no\r\n\r\nsupport. They can never formalise them and they know\r\n\r\nit.  That is why there was one phrase in the  speech\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Queenstown which I  thought  was\r\n\r\nsignificant,  because he himself drew  attention  to\r\n\r\nit.  Because in his verbal ramblings, he let the cat\r\n\r\nout  of the bag when he said that the essence of the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement  - that is  his  very  word,  the\r\n\r\nessence of the Malaysia Agreement - to which he  took\r\n\r\nthe  strongest objection was Article 6, dealing with\r\n\r\ndefence  pacts. It immediately struck me  that  this\r\n\r\nwas also an Article to which the strongest exception\r\n\r\nhas  been taken by certain confrontationists outside\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  Sir, ths more clearly than  anything\r\n\r\nelse reveals in whose interests the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare working. The same term \"essence\" - the others are\r\n\r\nall   part   of  the  propaganda  - of  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement to which they take the strongest objection\r\n\r\nis  that  part of the agreement which will safeguard\r\n\r\nthe security of the lives of the people of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nSir, I can well understand confrontationists outside\r\n\r\nof  this  country objecting to Malaysia, maybe  they\r\n\r\nhave  genuine misunderstandings about Malaysia. That\r\n\r\nis   their  business.  If  they  persist  in   their\r\n\r\nconfrontation,   it   is  our  business   as   loyal\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, loyal Malaysian people  and  loyal  to\r\n\r\nthe  people of this country, to try and explain away\r\n\r\nthe  misunderstandings foreign  friends  might  have\r\n\r\nabout  Malaysia.  But not so the  Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nThey are helping to magnify the misunderstandings by\r\n\r\ncreating the impression that there is opposition  to\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia. If they can give the impression\r\n\r\nto  outside  forces that they are in real opposition\r\n\r\nto  Malaysia,  then  it  is an  open  invitation  to\r\n\r\nintervention by forces outside who may misunderstand\r\n\r\nthe  situation.  They might say, \"It  is  worth  our\r\n\r\nwhile  intervening.\" That is a dangerous  role  that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis is playing.  As  far  as  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  are  concerned,  they  are   not\r\n\r\ninterested in defending the interests of the  people\r\n\r\nof Singapore. That is why they were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheld  in  contempt by the vast masses of the people.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why they were jeered and booed and laughed\r\n\r\nout  at Hong Lim and Jalan Besar, because the people\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  are  not  that  foolish.  They   are\r\n\r\nbeginning  to see that the Barisan Sosialis  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  hours  of  their lives are  playing  the  most\r\n\r\ndespicable of all roles that any political Party can\r\n\r\nplay   in   any  country  - betraying  their  people,\r\n\r\nbetraying their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no accident that when the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nfirst began their opposition to merger and Malaysia,\r\n\r\nMr Lim Ching Siong, amongst many other things, said\r\n\r\nthat  he  preferred merger with Indonesia to  merger\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation. It is no  accident  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  should  have   tried   to   give\r\n\r\nsupporting  action  in  Singapore  to  further   the\r\n\r\nforeign inspired revolt in Brunei. It is no accident\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member  for Queenstown  should  pick  out\r\n\r\nArticle 6 of the Malaysia Agreement as the essential\r\n\r\npart of the Agreement to which he is most opposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say after two years of bitter struggle, we do\r\n\r\nnot  mind losing out even to the S.P.A. Whatever  it\r\n\r\nis,  the  S.P.A. is  a Malaysian  Party,  loyal  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  whatever disagreement we have with  them.\r\n\r\nBut  when a political Party is prepared to sell  out\r\n\r\ntheir  own people merely to save their own political\r\n\r\nskin, then I say that when the time comes the people\r\n\r\nwill  deal  with  them not as a Malaysian  political\r\n\r\nParty  hut  as  Quislings, traitors,  who  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  because of the role  they  are  playing,\r\n\r\nwill  merit  their being - there are  legal  remedies\r\n\r\n- executed. Their's is a traitorous role - a sell-out.\r\n\r\nWe  do not mind being sold out to the Right-wing. We\r\n\r\ndo not mind being sold out even to the Tunku, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You are selling out to the British\r\n\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I do not mind being sold out to the\r\n\r\nBritish because the British at least are not part of\r\n\r\nour  life.

The  history of the Barisan  Sosialis  in  two\r\n\r\nyears  - 20th  July, 1961, started out with treachery.\r\n\r\nTheir  beginning to be a political Party  - treachery\r\n\r\n- ending  up  with  preparing for a sell-out,  for  a\r\n\r\ntraitorous  role. I can think of no more  inglorious\r\n\r\nend  to  an  inglorious Party. That we  should  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded after two years, we whom they have  called\r\n\r\nfeeble,  pro-colonialist stooges, though  we  are  a\r\n\r\nParty  - we  have not got all the experience  of  the\r\n\r\nM.C.P. of  30  years  - but  that  we  should   have\r\n\r\neventually  succeeded in getting them to admit  that\r\n\r\nthe  only  hope of their survival does  not  lie  in\r\n\r\ngetting  support from their own people  but  selling\r\n\r\nout  their  own people to outside forces.  That  has\r\n\r\nmade  our struggle worthwhile, the struggle  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial democrats against the Communists, worth every\r\n\r\nminute,  every  hour. Sir, as I have  said  earlier,\r\n\r\nthis  Government  is  now  preparing  to  inaugurate\r\n\r\nMalaysia Day not on 31st August, but on 30th August.\r\n\r\nWe  shall  send  them an invitation  because  up  to\r\n\r\nmidnight  of 30th August, we guarantee nothing  will\r\n\r\nhappen.

The  White\r\n\r\nPaper  proposals were put to the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nin  the referendum held last year, and because their\r\n\r\nsell-out plan was not put to the electorate,  as  it\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  fraudulent on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to do so, they campaigned for blank votes\r\n\r\nin a big way. Having suffered a resounding defeat at\r\n\r\nthe  polls,  they  turned round and  said  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  were  frightened by the loss of  citizenship\r\n\r\ninto  voting for the White Paper proposals and  that\r\n\r\nthe  referendum  was  a phoney  referendum.  Through\r\n\r\ntheir  trickery and lies, they were able to  get  25\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  the electorate, mostly in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  where their influence was greatest and  where\r\n\r\nthe   Government's   means   of   dissemination   of\r\n\r\ninformation had difficulty in penetrating,  to  cast\r\n\r\nblank votes. If, in fact, the people were frightened\r\n\r\nby   the   loss  of  citizenship  into  voting   for\r\n\r\nAlternative A in a big way, how is it that those who\r\n\r\ncast  blank votes were not actuated by the same sort\r\n\r\nof  fear?  This  is  what  the  Barisan  have  great\r\n\r\ndifficulty in trying to explain away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the contradictions in their own position are\r\n\r\nclearly  apparent  to  them.  But  for  those  whose\r\n\r\nfortunes are now hanging on a thread, what  do  such\r\n\r\ncontradictions  matter  so  long  as  they  can,  by\r\n\r\ntrickery  and  deception, put up a facade  that  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Agreement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis a sell-out of the fundamental\r\n\r\nrights of the people of Singapore, so that they  can\r\n\r\nmake one last attempt to confuse the people by their\r\n\r\nhypocrisy  and  their evil cunning?  They  who  have\r\n\r\nasked  the  people of Singapore to reject the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  proposals  in toto and cast blank  votes  now\r\n\r\nseek  in  an  amendment to claim that the Government\r\n\r\nhas cheated the people of Singapore by going back on\r\n\r\njust   one  of  the  clauses  of  the  White   Paper\r\n\r\nproposals.  It does not matter to them at  all  that\r\n\r\nthis  House  gave the Government a mandate  on  10th\r\n\r\nJune,  1963, to reach an early settlement  fair  and\r\n\r\njust to both sides on the basis of the terms of  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper proposals. It was in pursuance of  this\r\n\r\nmandate  that  the  Agreement was  entered  into  in\r\n\r\nLondon  recently. Have they attempted to  show  that\r\n\r\nthe Agreement was not fair and just to both sides on\r\n\r\nthe basis of the White Paper proposals? They now say\r\n\r\nthat  the  loss  of  our free port  status  was  not\r\n\r\nincluded   in   the  White  Paper   proposals   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  there  has been a  sell-out.  They  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to  hand over Singapore, lock,  stock  and\r\n\r\nbarrel,  to  the Central Government;  yet  they  now\r\n\r\ncomplain of the loss of the free port status. It  is\r\n\r\nnot dissimilar to their protest against Article 6 of\r\n\r\nthe   Malaysia  Agreement,  extending  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement to all the Malayan territories,  and  just\r\n\r\nas hollow. The negotiations in London were difficult\r\n\r\nenough,  each  side trying to get the  best  of  the\r\n\r\nbargain. If agreement was to be reached, concessions\r\n\r\nhad  to be made on both sides. It is only those  who\r\n\r\nseek  to mask their real intentions who will be bold\r\n\r\nenough to claim that the net result of the agreement\r\n\r\nreached in London is that Singapore has been  handed\r\n\r\nover  to  the Central Government as a dependency  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation, substituting British imperialism for\r\n\r\nFederation imperialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fair and just apportionment of the revenue to\r\n\r\npay  for  the Central Government responsibility  for\r\n\r\nservices  in  Singapore, hitherto the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Government, and to meet  the  new\r\n\r\nDefence  and External Affairs commitments  following\r\n\r\nfrom the establishment of Malaysia, had to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccepted  and  had to be worked out in  dollars  and\r\n\r\ncents.

In an outright gift  of  $50\r\n\r\nmillion,  the interest due which amounts to  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  sum of money every year on the capital  grant\r\n\r\nis lost for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Singapore is to survive as a viable\r\n\r\neconomic  entity  after merger, a common  market  is\r\n\r\nessential and it was the duty of the Singapore  side\r\n\r\nto   ensure   that   this  was  enshrined   in   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  This was done. The Rueff  Report  has\r\n\r\ndrawn  attention to the fact that the eventual  loss\r\n\r\nof  the  free  port status must be accepted  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of the new constitutional arrangements,  and\r\n\r\nthe  quid pro quo for this eventuality in the common\r\n\r\nmarket  has been assured to the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nin  safeguards  to be written into the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHas the Government sold out the rights of the people\r\n\r\nby  doing what a prudent Government would do in  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was a lot of loose talk from the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown on clauses of the constitution which\r\n\r\nhe  obviously does not understand and which find  an\r\n\r\nhonourable   place  in  all  federal  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements. One such proposal is the  power  given\r\n\r\nto  all  Central  Governments to suspend  the  State\r\n\r\nConstitution  under conditions of emergency  arising\r\n\r\nfrom political disturbances in a member State.

They have tried  in\r\n\r\nthis  last  sitting of this Assembly to confuse  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But the people know them only too  well  by\r\n\r\nnow.

The word \"freedom\" in its  democratic\r\n\r\ncontext  does  not mean a licence to create  trouble\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose of frustrating the wishes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  it  is not the denial  of  fundamental\r\n\r\ndemocratic  rights for the Government  to  take  all\r\n\r\nreasonable  steps to ensure that the wishes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  will  be respected and Malaysia  comes  into\r\n\r\nbeing  on  the  31st  of August in  a  peaceful  and\r\n\r\norderly manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that the combined Opposition has decided\r\n\r\nthat   there  shall  be  general  elections   before\r\n\r\nelections   for   the  15  seats  to   the   Central\r\n\r\nParliament,  there will be general elections  before\r\n\r\nthe  year  is out, but not for the purpose of  fresh\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks.

The  inexorable  logic  of\r\n\r\nevents  has  taken its full course and a chapter  in\r\n\r\nour  history  is soon to be closed.

For those who\r\n\r\nare too deeply committed and cannot see the error of\r\n\r\ntheir  ways,  they  must be  prepared  to  take  the\r\n\r\nconsequences of their own folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now deal with the points of difficulty\r\n\r\nwhich  have  troubled the Member  for  Farrer  Park.\r\n\r\nClause 69 of the Malaysia Bill deals with amendments\r\n\r\nto   the   Federal  Constitution,   and   the   only\r\n\r\nLegislature  which  can  be  concerned   with   such\r\n\r\namendments is the Federal Parliament. As the  Leader\r\n\r\nof  the  House has already pointed out, this Article\r\n\r\nis  parallel  in  terms with  clause  66(2)   of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Bill which deals with the same position  as\r\n\r\nregards  the Borneo States. Clause 69 and clause  66\r\n\r\n(2)   of the Malaysia Bill are not at all in conflict\r\n\r\nwith Article 90 of the Constitution of the State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, which deals only with amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Constitution. The broad effect of  clause\r\n\r\n69  of  the  Malaysia Bill is that  even  where  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament has enacted a law  amending  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the Federation of Malaysia with  the\r\n\r\nrequisite  majority,  it  will  still  require   the\r\n\r\nconsent  of  the  Government  of  Singapore  if  the\r\n\r\namendment  affects  the  position  of  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nregard  to the matters set out in clause 69. But  as\r\n\r\nfar   as  the  Singapore  Legislative  Assembly   is\r\n\r\nconcerned,   it   can  only  amend   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution   provided  that   the   amendment   is\r\n\r\nsupported by the required majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Members of the House who belong\r\n\r\nto   political   Parties  and   who   switch   their\r\n\r\naffiliation from the Party for which they stood  for\r\n\r\nelection,  the accepted constitutional  position  in\r\n\r\nthe  British parliamentary system is that  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  legally  bound to vacate their  seats.  But  in\r\n\r\nother   countries  which  also  subscribe   to   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system of parliamentary government, where\r\n\r\nthere  is  provision for proportional representation\r\n\r\nas  in  France, the concept is that it is the  Party\r\n\r\nwhich   is   represented  and  not  the   individual\r\n\r\ncandidate.  In  that system where a Member  switches\r\n\r\nhis  Party  affiliation, he is replaced  by  another\r\n\r\nMember of the same Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in law and in fact, there are no rigid forms\r\n\r\nof parliamentary practice and there is no reason why\r\n\r\nwe  should  not  draw  on  our  own  experiences  to\r\n\r\nimprovise a new form of parliamentary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractice  to meet our own local situation.  We  have\r\n\r\ntherefore introduced a provision which combines  the\r\n\r\nBritish emphasis on the individual candidate and the\r\n\r\nFrench concept of Party representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Article 30 (2) (b) of the Singapore Constitution\r\n\r\nis  accepted,  then the resulting  vacancy  must  be\r\n\r\nfilled  in accordance with the provisions of Article\r\n\r\n33.  As I understand it, the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\ndoes  not  object  to Article 33  but  only  to  the\r\n\r\nomission of the provision that the vacancy should be\r\n\r\nfilled  within  three months. However,  the  present\r\n\r\nSingapore (Constitution) Order in Council  does  not\r\n\r\nprescribe  any period within which the vacancy  must\r\n\r\nbe   filled,  and  for  that  reason  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndelegation  did not agree to the imposition  of  any\r\n\r\ntime  limit  in  the  new Constitution.  There  are,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  no  real  points of  difficulty  in  the\r\n\r\namendments introduced by the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\nI  would,  therefore, invite him to  reconsider  the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, this subject has been accepted by all - by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  by  the Opposition,  and  even  by  the\r\n\r\npublic  - as  one  of  a  grave  national  character.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Prime  Minister  was  accorded  due\r\n\r\nsilence  and respect when he moved a very  intricate\r\n\r\nmotion  and  spoke for nearly three hours.  In  that\r\n\r\nspeech  of his, he said - let me just quote from  my\r\n\r\nshorthand notes which I have - \"I do not want to deal\r\n\r\nin   detail  with  the  financial  arrangements.  My\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for Finance, who  bore  the\r\n\r\nbrunt of the detailed work and the argument with his\r\n\r\ncounterpart in the Federation will do so. If I  know\r\n\r\nhim,  he  will do so competently.\". He said that  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech.  That  was yesterday.  We  waited.  The\r\n\r\nfinancial  arrangements and the common market  terms\r\n\r\nare  matters of grave importance, matters which have\r\n\r\nnot  been discussed in the Assembly, and matters  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government has received no  mandate.  We\r\n\r\nwaited, we waited, and we waited. My colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMember for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFarrer   Park,   in  his  speech  touched   on   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional points. He did say to the  Government\r\n\r\nthat  we  were  waiting to hear  the  views  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance; in fact, his guidance  as  to\r\n\r\nhow   the  arrangements  reached  between  the   two\r\n\r\nGovernments are - using the words of the motion - fair\r\n\r\nand  just.  We waited. After the Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  had spoken and invited the Government to carry\r\n\r\nout  the  advice  of  the Prime Minister,  to  which\r\n\r\nadvice  we  listened with great interest  and  great\r\n\r\nrespect,  we waited for the Minister for Finance  to\r\n\r\ninform  this House what are the benefits  that  will\r\n\r\naccrue  to  Singapore which are  fair  and  just  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia  out of the terms that had been reached  in\r\n\r\nLondon  over  the  financial  arrangements  and  the\r\n\r\nCommon  Market.  We are the more interested  because\r\n\r\nthose  were  the two points that the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand  the  Minister for Finance had been play  acting\r\n\r\nall  along before they even went to London, and  had\r\n\r\nbeen play acting in London too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we were to say that we were anxious\r\n\r\nto   know,   to  understand  and  to  support   with\r\n\r\nunderstanding the arrangements reached, could we  be\r\n\r\naccused if I were to say that I had been let down by\r\n\r\nthe  Government whose Minister for Finance only  sat\r\n\r\nhere and interjected and misbehaved himself, instead\r\n\r\nof giving the Opposition the guidance that we needed\r\n\r\nso much for the interest of the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leader of the House - the Deputy Prime Minister - when he jumped up to reply to the points on constitutional law brought up by my colleague, the Member for Farrer Park, said also that the Minister for Finance would speak on the financial arrangements and the Common Market. That was before the dinner break. After that we had two more\r\n\r\nMinisters  coming in - the Minister for  Culture  and\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Law.

Surely, how can  the  Opposition\r\n\r\ncriticise  or  support  the  financial  arrangements\r\n\r\nreached  in  London  if  the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nhimself did not give the guidance that is necessary?\r\n\r\nThe Minister for Finance is not the Minister for the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. but the Minister for the whole of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  our Minister for Finance too, and therefore  he\r\n\r\nhas  a  responsibility to guide us  and  to  let  us\r\n\r\nunderstand the things that he thinks are right,  and\r\n\r\nwe  are anxious, with understanding, to support him.\r\n\r\nBut no, the Minister for Culture, who just now stood\r\n\r\nup  on a point of elucidation, took nearly two hours\r\n\r\n-  what  is that? politics!

But there was something  in\r\n\r\nthat speech of his which is repetitious, a sort of a\r\n\r\nrecord  of  His  Master's Voice.  Just  because  his\r\n\r\nmaster  said, \"Oh, the S.P.A. is linked up with  the\r\n\r\nBarisan to vote against the Federal Elections  Bill\"\r\n\r\ntherefore the S.P.A. and the Barisan are doing this,\r\n\r\nthat  and  the others, although after a  responsible\r\n\r\nMember  of  the  Opposition, the Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark, had stood up and explained the reason for  the\r\n\r\nopposition of the Alliance to the Federal  Elections\r\n\r\nBill,  and gave two points. One point was  that  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading  of that Bill could  and  should  be\r\n\r\ntaken  after the Malaysia debate. The second  point,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very  important and which  has  not  been\r\n\r\nexplained  away by the Government, is that according\r\n\r\nto  the  Bill, the dice is loaded in favour  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and that if the Government would only make an\r\n\r\nhonest   attempt  to  show  that  they  too  desired\r\n\r\nelections  conducted in an honest way so that  there\r\n\r\ncould be fair play for all, we could have understood\r\n\r\nit.  In  fact, the Member for Farrer Park  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  the ball is now at their feet. No, they  would\r\n\r\nprefer, if possible, to rig the elections as much as\r\n\r\npossible. When their evil intentions were found out,\r\n\r\nwhat  did they do? They said they had been receiving\r\n\r\nCommunist   tutelage   on  propaganda;   first-class\r\n\r\npropaganda to confound the public. \"Oh, the Alliance\r\n\r\nis  afraid  of elections, and therefore  they  voted\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Bill.\"  [Interruption]  I  thank   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance for saying that that is  quite\r\n\r\nright.  He  admitted  that  he  received  very  good\r\n\r\nCommunist  tutelage on the art of distortion.  Quite\r\n\r\nright. He learns that. So, therefore, they went  out\r\n\r\ntalking,   \"The  Alliance  is  afraid   of   general\r\n\r\nelections,  and  therefore, they voted  against  the\r\n\r\nFederal Elections Bill.\" They repeatedly said  that.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for Culture repeated  it  even  after\r\n\r\nhaving heard what the Member for Farrer Park had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  to  the Government, that the ball  is  now  at\r\n\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not like to waste the time of this\r\n\r\nHouse  by repeating what the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nhas  said, but in replying I would like to touch  on\r\n\r\ncertain points raised by the Leader of the House and\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Law. They are in regard to three\r\n\r\nlegal points raised by the Member for Farrer Park. I\r\n\r\nwould  like to reply to them in due course,  but  in\r\n\r\nthe  meantime,  let us tackle the  speeches  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters, in the order of the last Minister  first.\r\n\r\nApart  from the legal point, which I would bring  up\r\n\r\nat a later stage, what I am going to speak no now is\r\n\r\nmore on the points of a political character than  of\r\n\r\na  constitutional character. He says, \"The  combined\r\n\r\nOpposition has dissented, so there shall be  general\r\n\r\nelections  before the year is out,\" and this  coming\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister for Law. He knows that the  1962\r\n\r\nElectoral Registers are null and void, because -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Because of what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - because of the Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative     Assembly    Elections     (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) (Amendment) Bill tabled last  Wednesday.\r\n\r\nThat  Bill had a Second Reading on Wednesday. I will\r\n\r\njust  talk  very briefly on this. The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs, in moving the Second Reading  of  the\r\n\r\nBill, unfortunately set the wrong tone, and got  the\r\n\r\ntails of the Opposition up. What did he say? \"Oh, we\r\n\r\nthe  Government  say  there  is  no  need  for  this\r\n\r\namending  Bill.  The Government believes  and  still\r\n\r\nmaintains  that  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections    (Temporary    Provisions)    Ordinance,\r\n\r\nintroduced  in June and forced through  against  the\r\n\r\nwhole  united  Opposition objection, was  right  and\r\n\r\nlegal.\"  In  June, it was pointed out by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park  and  by me,  that  that  amending\r\n\r\nlegislation   could   only   legalise    the    late\r\n\r\ncertification of the Electoral Registers.  It  could\r\n\r\nnot  legalise  the  acts done  by  the  Registration\r\n\r\nOfficer  in conducting the registration,  when  such\r\n\r\nacts  were done after the end of 1962, that  is,  in\r\n\r\nFebruary  1963.  Therefore, it was  urged  upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that they should consider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarefully  putting in a provision to make it  beyond\r\n\r\nall doubt that the acts of the Registration Officer,\r\n\r\ncarried   out  in  February  1963,  which  were   in\r\n\r\ncontravention   of  section  50  of  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, should  be\r\n\r\nprotected.  I urged upon the Minister then  that  he\r\n\r\nshould  give serious consideration to this point  of\r\n\r\nlaw.  The  Member  for Farrer Park appealed  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law and sought his wisdom. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law  chose to be silent. The Minister for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  just  went ahead and said, \"This  Bill  was\r\n\r\nprepared  and vetted by the State Advocate-General's\r\n\r\nDepartment, and surely it must have been all right.\"\r\n\r\nThey  pushed it through against the whole Opposition\r\n\r\nvote,   immediately  after  that,  they  tabled   an\r\n\r\namending  Bill at the following sitting, i.e.  July,\r\n\r\non  a  Certificate of Urgency. What did the Minister\r\n\r\nsay  then?  I  would not like to  waste  time  going\r\n\r\nthrough  the Official Report, but in effect this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  he said, \"Oh, you know, I tabled this amending\r\n\r\nBill,  not  because the Government thinks  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  is right - the Government still  maintains\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  right - but in order to accommodate  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  so  this amending Bill is  introduced.\"\r\n\r\nSurely,  Sir,  that  is  not  the  way  to   run   a\r\n\r\ngovernment.  That  is  not  the  way  to   introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation.   What  was  the  reaction   from   the\r\n\r\nOpposition?  Up  we  jumped. We said  that  what  we\r\n\r\nadvised the Government to do, the Government  should\r\n\r\nhave  done.  If the Government had been a democratic\r\n\r\nGovernment,  upholding the practice of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  it  would have given due weight  to  any\r\n\r\nOpposition  objection together with legal reasoning,\r\n\r\nand  then it could have deferred the Committee Stage\r\n\r\nfor just one hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen)</b>: Order.

It would\r\n\r\nalso appear that what the Prime Minister does is not\r\n\r\neven  known  to the Ministers, so much so  that  the\r\n\r\nthree  Ministers  who  stood up  - the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  the  Minister  for  Culture,   and   tile\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law - did not talk about the documents.\r\n\r\nNo.  They  talked about the hard and  long  struggle\r\n\r\nwith  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  the  Communists,  the\r\n\r\nRight.  Left,  and Centre. \"Everybody is  Communist\"\r\n\r\n- that is what they talk about. They did not talk  of\r\n\r\nthe  documents,  and  I must  say  this,  Sir,  they\r\n\r\nthemselves  do  not know what is in  the  documents,\r\n\r\nbecause  they themselves did not have  the  time  to\r\n\r\nstudy  what  is in them.

The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister could have explained that Article  30\r\n\r\n(2)   (b)   is a new one, and could have said,  \"Watch\r\n\r\nout,  the implications mean this and we ask  you  to\r\n\r\nsupport us on this because you know the Barisan boys\r\n\r\nleft us.

How could I have read  anything\r\n\r\nwhen  all  these Documents were still  kept  by  him\r\n\r\nsecret  until Sunday afternoon? Sir, this is typical\r\n\r\nof P.A.P. propaganda! He said, \"There is this Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill, busy making money, and he  does  not\r\n\r\neven have the time to read the Documents,\" when,  in\r\n\r\nactual  fact, he was even afraid to let us have  the\r\n\r\nDocuments  in  time.  This is  the  kind  of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nculture,  P.A.P. crookedness, and P.A.P. attempt  to\r\n\r\ntry  to \"fix the Opposition.\" Yes, Sir, \"to fix  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.\" The Prime Minister has said, \"I can fix\r\n\r\nyou, but you cannot fix me.\" Never mind, although we\r\n\r\ncannot  fix  him,  we will see  him  buried  at  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections and I do not think  I  will  even\r\n\r\nsend him a wreath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is interesting. He said that I was in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur sitting and waiting. He said  that  he\r\n\r\nsaw  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  waiting  patiently\r\n\r\noutside the Cabinet, and that it afforded them  some\r\n\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Great amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That day, the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance went up. I went up too. The\r\n\r\nnight  before,  I  knew what the  trouble  was.  The\r\n\r\ntrouble was this $50 million grant. The P.A.P. said,\r\n\r\n\"No  loan.  The common market in terms  have  to  be\r\n\r\nspelt out. We are going to be firm.\" I must say that\r\n\r\nI  had  talks with the P.A.P. because I was just  as\r\n\r\nanxious  as they were. You must not forget, Sir,  on\r\n\r\n10th  June it was my motion demanding fair and  just\r\n\r\nterms.  It  was  my  motion,  not  the  Government's\r\n\r\nmotion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemanding   fair  and  just  terms  for   a   merger\r\n\r\nagreement.  So I went up, Because I am a friend  and\r\n\r\nstill  am  proud to be a friend of the Ministers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, I went to the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nand said, \"This is very difficult, you know. I think\r\n\r\nyou  had better change your stand. Do not spoil  the\r\n\r\nchances  of Malaysia. Accept the loan and  think  of\r\n\r\nsomething   else.  Let  it  be  written   into   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\" I was for it in an honest attempt  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  P.A.P. At the time they were having  that\r\n\r\nmeeting, I was anxious, because I knew the temper of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers in the Federation. Their  temper  was\r\n\r\nnot  that  they wanted to extract as  much  as  they\r\n\r\ncould   out  of  Singapore  but  because  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was playing party politics the whole  time.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for Finance an ogre - whereas  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Cabinet, I can say this, Sir.  There  is\r\n\r\nreal collective responsibility. There every Minister\r\n\r\nknows  what  the  other Ministers are  doing.  There\r\n\r\nevery  decision is taken by the Cabinet. But  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  so here with the P.A.P. Everything is the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  He  went  to  negotiate.  \"Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance?  Ah, get out! When he comes, get out.\"  And\r\n\r\nhe kept on talking about finance - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hoc -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Prime Minister talking about\r\n\r\nfinance,  and yet he accused the Federation Minister\r\n\r\nof'  Finance  as  being the big  bad  wolf.  Whereas\r\n\r\nwhatever  points presented  by  the  Minister \r\n\r\nfor Finance  in  the Federation were the points \r\n\r\ndecided upon  by  the  Federation Government.\r\n\r\nIt  serves  the P.A.P. to twist and to distort - M.C.A., M.C.A. \r\n\r\nWhy? Because they really feel afraid that the Chinese  in \r\n\r\nSingapore  are  going to throw the P.A.P. down  the drain.\r\n\r\nSo  they say, \"The M.C.A. jahat, very,  very evil  men.\"\r\n\r\nHere  it is the same  thing.  They  are trying to twist \r\n\r\nthe U.M.N.O. and the M.C.A. They are calling  the S.P.A. very \r\n\r\nevil men and U.M.N.O. baik punya  orang-lah, banyak baik. \r\n\r\nWhat are they  trying to do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I was anxious. I was more anxious than the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Why, Sir? Because I say the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe people of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  should come first and not party politics.\r\n\r\nI  was anxious. I thought the meeting would be  over\r\n\r\nin  an hour. Unfortunately, Brunei was included  and\r\n\r\nthey  met  right up to ten past one. I  met  a  very\r\n\r\ncharming civil servant who said, \"Tun, come into the\r\n\r\nroom  and sit down. It is air-conditioned.\" I  said,\r\n\r\n\"What for the air-conditioned room?

So they say, \"What\r\n\r\nis  this'? What is he doing?\" I was more anxious.  I\r\n\r\nwould  not  call and embarrass any Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government, especially the Prime Minister who\r\n\r\nis very dictatorial and very vindictive. I would not\r\n\r\nlike  to name any Minister. Yet at lunch time I  was\r\n\r\nthere,  so  was the Minister for Finance. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  could  not go and I felt  sorry  for  him,\r\n\r\nbecause Mrs Lee Kuan Yew had to go to London for an\r\n\r\noperation. So the Prime Minister was at the airport.\r\n\r\nBut what I want to point out is this. At that lunch:\r\n\r\nI did shake my head and say, \"Oh, why come to such a\r\n\r\ndecision.\" The decision was taken. Yet it would seem\r\n\r\nthat  the interests of the people of Singapore  were\r\n\r\nonly  entrusted to the P.A.P. and the  P.A.P. only.\r\n\r\nNobody  else. Anybody else who wants to do  it, and\r\n\r\nbecause we are on this side of the House: we  happen\r\n\r\nto  sit  in front of the Barisan; very soon Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  may  become a Communist too. I  do  not  know.\r\n\r\nCould be. By their way of reasoning, it could be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk of the referendum. Of course, the\r\n\r\nreferendum was again attacked by the Opposition. Not\r\n\r\nme.  The Barisan, the good ex-comrades of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nBut  what did the Prime Minister in his speech  say?\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister,  a very  responsible  man!  He\r\n\r\nadmitted this unashamedly in his speech. \"You  know,\r\n\r\nwe  worked in such a way that we rigged the counting\r\n\r\nof  the  votes.  51 tables for 51 divisions.  Nobody\r\n\r\nknew  where  they  were.\" But we knew.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are clever boys. They put in suns of  paper\r\n\r\nto  show  that this is from Anson; or  that  man  is\r\n\r\nliving  in  Cairnhill Road, so it must be Cairnhill;\r\n\r\nor that woman is living in Toa Payoh, so that is Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh. There was a game going on between the Barisan\r\n\r\nand the P.A.P. They say we are little innocents.  We\r\n\r\nare  innocent? We are clean. We do not stoop to such\r\n\r\ndirty  practice. We knew what was going on. Did  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer  Park  not  say  in  very  sober\r\n\r\nlanguage  that  we gave the P.A.P. our  support  on\r\n\r\nMalaysia?  We gave the P.A.P. our support for  Paper\r\n\r\nCmd.  33.  We gave the Prime Minister all the  elbow\r\n\r\nroom he wanted, the whole stage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  play  with  and  to  perform  on.  This  is  not\r\n\r\ncheating,  Sir.  This  does mean  to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  is rigged. No. It s the way  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwanted  to  find  out for their own  P.A.P. selfish\r\n\r\nends.  \"Here in Hong Lim, how many blank votes.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim cannot know. But I know.\"  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Prime  Minister knows. \"Ah, it  is  nothing.\r\n\r\nOnly  18  per cent. Forget the Member for Hong  Lim.\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar? Ah, it does not matter. 12 per  cent\r\n\r\nand  still  nothing. We could still win.  The  rural\r\n\r\nareas? Jurong? Oh my God, Jurong is 49 per cent.\" So\r\n\r\nthey  knew  there was 49 per cent in  Jurong.  Tidak\r\n\r\nApah.  They know how to work. So you see  that  they\r\n\r\nare  playing  the party game the whole  time  - party\r\n\r\npolitics  -  instead  of getting  to  work  for  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people of Singapore. The Barisan was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  shoot  down the P.A.P. and  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwanted  to  choke  the Barisan.  \"Got  them  by  the\r\n\r\nthroat\" - I think that was the expression used.  That\r\n\r\nis  not  the way. We do not mind letting the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nknow in a crooked way how the voting went. We do not\r\n\r\nworry  about  that  because  as  sure  as  there  is\r\n\r\nretribution,  that  retribution  will  come  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. on polling day - the general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.
