The gap between Singapore and its regional competitors has narrowed significantly.&nbsp; Top doctors from the region, whether they are from countries like Malaysia, India, Philippines and China, are no less than many of our top doctors.&nbsp; In India and China, procedures are done at a fraction of our cost.&nbsp; Many of their top doctors have been trained in top western foreign medical institutions.&nbsp; Today, the reality is that a large number of nurses, medical technologists and radiographers come from our neighbouring countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government tells Singaporeans to be entrepreneurial, take risks, grow the economy, create jobs; and on its side, it will provide incentives, regulate lightly and remove bureaucratic hurdles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dream of a Singapore Regional Medical Hub where we combine the best of Singapore and the region by drawing upon the talent of some of the brightest and best doctors from the region, including Malaysia, India, Philippines and China.&nbsp; In this sense, where the large majority of the patients are foreigners, these foreign consultant specialist doctors can be allowed to practise independently to service our large foreign private sector pool.&nbsp; They are allowed accreditation to <p align=left>Column: 2058<p>perform procedures based on their training and experience.&nbsp; They adopt Singapore standards of medical practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We work with the medical MNCs to become regional centres of excellence in various areas of medical advances.&nbsp; As we continue to maintain high standards, we provide cost competitive healthcare services which make us a magnet for foreign patients.&nbsp; When we grow sufficiently big to have a big pool of local and foreign specialists, we will set up outposts where we use Singapore standards but local costs.&nbsp; In a few years, Singapore Regional Medical Hub will compete in the home ground of our ASEAN neighbours and in South Asia and China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing talent from the region, being reference centres for medical technology, practising the highest standards of medicine and remaining cost competitive, Singapore Regional Medical Hub eventually becomes the medical centre of choice in Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans dare to dream, take the risk and raise the standards.&nbsp; We want to lead in the world and are not content to be just followers of other countries.&nbsp; We may run into competition with the public sector but we need not fear if the competition is open and transparent without resorting to bureaucratic hurdles, turf protection measures and harassment through Government agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans know what they must do to beat the competition, but the steps ahead require rapid changes in the system.&nbsp; Is the Ministry of Health ready?&nbsp; As one senior healthcare official told me&nbsp; -&nbsp; you are too far ahead of the time, we cannot change fast enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know whether all these will continue to remain a dream or whether it will become a reality.&nbsp; But one thing I know for sure is that in India and China,<p align=left>Column: 2059<p> their large pool of foreign trained specialists will post a formidable challenge to Singapore.&nbsp; If we do not act fast enough, not only will the number of foreigners coming to Singapore decrease, the number of Singaporeans seeking private healthcare treatment overseas will increase.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alexander Chan Meng Wah (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

-&nbsp; the National Healthcare Group (NHG) and the Singapore Health Services (SHS).&nbsp; This was to enable more integrated and better quality healthcare services through greater cooperation and collaboration among public sector healthcare providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me declare that I am a director on the board of the National Healthcare Group, one of the two public healthcare clusters.&nbsp; Having seen the genesis and the early-stage transformation of this cluster, I know that there were numerous challenges to meet, as expected in any new organisation with new management, newly created and reformed competition, the changing patient demand picture and the newly crafted regional segmentation of the restructured hospitals.&nbsp; There was great impact on staff at many levels, leading to movements between hospitals and clusters, due largely to the perceived imbalance of medical disciplines between the two clusters at the start, and the perceived difference in management styles as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, five years after the birth, these two hospital clusters have stabilised their respective operations.&nbsp; The entities seem to be driven by well staffed mission oriented management teams supported by their respective boards.&nbsp; There have been critics of the cluster system as well as <p align=left>Column: 2060<p>supporters no doubt.&nbsp; The rising development of competing hospital systems in the neighbouring countries as others before me have talked about, plus the continuing public attention on healthcare costs, may have also added some doubt as to whether the original goals and objectives of hospital clustering are being achieved.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how he assesses the situation and whether he views the clusters as fulfilling the original goals and objectives, whether there is a need to change these goals and objectives and therefore whether there is a further change anticipated to the clusters.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

At the same time, they have the objective to pursue medical excellence and thus provide certain premium services.&nbsp; This is definitely an inspiring and exciting goal in line with our desired status to be a centre for medical excellence.&nbsp; However, the availability of premium services in public facilities often leads to very high cost for certain families.&nbsp; For example, whenever a patient is admitted regardless of the class of the ward, the family of the patient would normally request that the medical personnel choose the best available treatment for their loved ones.&nbsp; More often than not, there is&nbsp;little discussion over cheaper alternative treatment, particularly&nbsp;because the filial piety is part of our Asian culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There may be some marginal differences in their effectiveness but the cost difference can be substantial.&nbsp; Thus, I would like to recommend that our <p align=left>Column: 2061<p>current two clusters focus on providing basic health services only,&nbsp; and if the two medical clusters are to pursue premium services to set up the third cluster, if necessary, for these premium services.&nbsp; The third cluster would have the freedom to pursue excellence for more cutting-edge medicine in our quest to be the world class centre for excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Traditional Chinese Medicine</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> &nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and I wish to speak in Mandarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, I wish to thank the Minister for Health who has, after listening&nbsp; &nbsp;to my repeated appeals in Parliament, finally decided to allow qualified Chinese physicians to treat patients in the wards of approved public hospitals.

I hope that, in the not too distant future, similar cooperation plan may be extended to more Government hospitals and clinics. However, to arrive at such a stage, as pointed out by Minister Khaw Boon Wan, the pre-requisite is that the professional standard of the Chinese physicians must be raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">At present, we have two colleges providing specialised training for Chinese physicians.

I understand that the two colleges are actively training a considerable number of Chinese physicians. In recent years, there is an upward trend in both enrolment and number of graduates. Since we do not have any TCM hospital, the number of outlets available to the fresh graduates is limited. Generally speaking, they can only play the role of the primary healthcare providers after graduation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the field of western medicine, our only NUS <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Medical</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> trains more than 200 western doctors each year. About half of them will eventually become family doctors. The second medical school will start its enrolment soon to train even more western doctors.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B> Mr Chairman, I thank Dr Michael Lim for his comments on our ambition to become the regional medical hub, an initiative which we have codenamed <I>SingaporeMedicine</I>.&nbsp; I share his dream, not every single detail, but at least the larger plot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee felt that we could succeed in <I>SingaporeMedicine</I>.&nbsp; Years ago, we were a clear leader in the region.&nbsp; But as Dr Lim&nbsp;pointed out, our competitors have quietly narrowed the gap with us.&nbsp; It is not just Parkway in Malaysia, or Bumrungrad in Bangkok.&nbsp; It is now also Apollo, Escorts, Max Healthcare and Fortis in India.&nbsp; If we are not careful, it will soon be Shanghai, Beijing and Dubai.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim asked if MOH is ready to make his dream come true.&nbsp; <I>SingaporeMedicine</I> is not strictly an MOH portfolio.&nbsp; But from MTI where I was for seven years, I knew that without MOH's support, <I>SingaporeMedicine</I> will be so much harder to achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To secure our lead, we have many things to do: increase supply, step up training, let in more foreign talent, make our&nbsp;cost more competitive&nbsp;and work more actively with world-class partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ministry of Health's past ambivalence on <I>SingaporeMedicine</I> is not without good <p align=left>Column: 2065<p>reasons.&nbsp; As increased demand would have to be supported by more specialists, there were concerns that more specialists, in turn, would lead to higher demand.&nbsp; The assumption is, as what Dr Tan Sze Wee has just noted, that supply could induce demand in healthcare.&nbsp; The end result is higher healthcare cost.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supply-induced demand is real but is not unique to healthcare.&nbsp; Wherever there is market failure and unequal power between provider and consumer, the potential for supply to induce demand exists. &nbsp;For example, where sellers know more than the buyers, what economists call&nbsp;information asymmetry,&nbsp;an irresponsible seller can creatively induce spurious demand.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at motor repair workshops.&nbsp; Most of us know how to drive, but I think very few of us know exactly&nbsp;how engines work, let alone how to&nbsp;fix a car problem.&nbsp; So this is a classic case of information asymmetry between the mechanic and the car owner.&nbsp; So, bad luck, you go to a mechanic who is irresponsible, he will say: fix this or fix that, this is the bill.&nbsp; I think very few of us will be able to argue with him or to even know whether we&nbsp;have been taken for a ride.&nbsp; And if insurance is going to pick up the tab, most car owners may not even care.&nbsp; They are more interested in how soon they can get the car back in good shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many examples of such market failures.&nbsp; When you go to a strange city where&nbsp;you are not familiar with the roads, you hop into a taxi -&nbsp; information asymmetry - and you say, \"I'm here.&nbsp; I want to go there,\" and the taxi driver took you on a long way,&nbsp;you may not even realise it;&nbsp;hence, the expression \"taken for a ride\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way to address such market failures is not to restrict supply and expect demand to go down.&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct <p align=left>Column: 2066<p>response is to make as much information as available to consumers,&nbsp;reduce the information asymmetry so that consumers can&nbsp;make better informed choices.&nbsp; If they cannot digest the information, they can seek third party advice, for instance, from their family physicians or their insurers.&nbsp; That is why it is so important for every Singaporean to have a good family physician.&nbsp;It is crucial - very important.&nbsp; Equally important, we need to put in place a framework which generates incentives for hospitals to provide good basic healthcare with minimum resources.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some time now, we control the supply of specialists as a policy, on the premise that this would moderate healthcare demand.&nbsp; But from an economic point of view, this logic may not be entirely correct.&nbsp; As I said just now, it is wishful thinking to hope that with fewer specialists, demand for their services will go down.&nbsp; This is particularly so when demand is largely driven by exogenous factors, like &nbsp;in our case,&nbsp;by our&nbsp;ageing population and our aspirations to be a regional medical hub.&nbsp; Over-restricting supply in the face of independently-rising demand will simply drive up healthcare costs, as prices will adjust to the excess demand.&nbsp; This is Economics 101.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I favour taking a more market-based approach to manpower planning.&nbsp; We must be responsive to market demand and we must be flexible in adjusting supply.&nbsp; Yes, there are valid concerns about supply-induced demand.&nbsp; We will watch the situation carefully.&nbsp; But, at the same time, we must take care not to rigidly control numbers and overly-choke supply,&nbsp;creating a severe excess-demand situation.&nbsp; After all, if <I>SingaporeMedicine</I> makes progress and we still restrict the training of specialists, queues will simply lengthen, and prices just&nbsp;go up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also step up training, but not just for ourselves.&nbsp; We must help train our<p align=left>Column: 2067<p> neighbours, particularly Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and China.&nbsp; Many are very&nbsp;keen to learn from us.&nbsp; Every year, our hospitals play host to thousands of such doctor visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should welcome such trainees, even from countries which we may not have traditionally recruited from.&nbsp; The best amongst them, we hope, will&nbsp;eventually settle down here, and become Singaporeans; the rest will go back and they become very important links for us&nbsp;to their region.&nbsp; Moreover, with a larger patient base, we can train our own doctors better and faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at India and China, which Dr Michael Lim described.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of organ transplants, coronary artery bypasses and joint replacements that their doctors get to work on is mind-boggling.&nbsp; What our trainees get in one year, they can get in one&nbsp;month; sometimes two weeks! &nbsp;Coupled with their vast pool of talent and hungry ambition, it is a matter of time their skills will surpass ours.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should not be afraid that we are training our competitors.&nbsp; The strength of Singapore is our ability to get things to work and maintain operational efficiency over time.&nbsp; We are good at operating complex systems.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at Changi Airport and PSA.&nbsp; Others can buy the same hardware, the same cranes, the same IT equipment and so on.&nbsp; But we stay ahead of competition by operating what we have, effectively and efficiently.&nbsp; Likewise, our regional healthcare competitors can buy the same technology that we have.&nbsp; But I am confident that our hospitals have what it takes to stay ahead of competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Michael Lim has painted his dream.&nbsp; Let me share with Members my vision.&nbsp; It is that our hospitals can be the best in Asia and be&nbsp;acknowledged as such by our peers. But let me quickly clarify what \u201cthe best\ufffd? means.&nbsp; To be the best does not <p align=left>Column: 2068<p>mean the tallest, shiniest buildings or the most&nbsp;expensive equipment.&nbsp; \"The best\ufffd? means we have the best clinical outcomes, the lowest morbidity and mortality, the lowest complication rates, the fastest recovery, the lowest usage of resources.&nbsp; And we come up with new productive devices, new effective techniques, and new processes.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all specialties can achieve this.&nbsp; But, hopefully, a handful can produce results within a few years, which will then encourage the other specialties.&nbsp; Can we make it?&nbsp; I know&nbsp;it is a tall order.&nbsp; But we have proven our abilities in other areas before.&nbsp; Yesterday, I spoke about our SMs model of funding healthcare,&nbsp;totally made in Singapore.&nbsp; Our response to SARS was world-class, and again made in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;With some of our best students in medicine, and some of our best talent in healthcare, we must put these top brains to work.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim spoke obliquely about \u201cbureaucratic hurdles, turf protection and harassment through Government agencies\ufffd?, all of which could turn his dream into a nightmare.&nbsp; He spoke, presumably, from his own experience.&nbsp; I listened carefully;&nbsp;I got his \u201ccoded\ufffd? message.&nbsp; Let me encourage him not to lose his passion.&nbsp; Changing mindsets overnight is not possible.&nbsp; But there are people within the Ministry who share his dream.&nbsp; Count me as one.&nbsp; Together, let us make it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;medical leadership&nbsp;is keen&nbsp;to work towards this vision, but acknowledging the challenges.&nbsp; If we stay focused and we are prepared to be bold in our approach, with determination, I think, after five to 10 years, we should be able to produce significant results.&nbsp; But we must be prepared to change, re-engineer our processes, and work with the best.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Dr Chong Weng Chiew mentioned traditional Chinese medicine<p align=left>Column: 2069<p> (TCM), let me use that as an illustration.&nbsp; It is a very difficult subject, given our lack of domain knowledge.&nbsp; There is a certain mystique about it because we do not know what we do not know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the regulatory regime for TCM herbs as an example.&nbsp; We have two options: do nothing, keep them largely unregulated and hope that no accidents happen.&nbsp; Or we can&nbsp;proactively engage the TCM experts and the industry to see whether we can develop a regulatory and&nbsp;certification system which can, in fact, be a global model.&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers all over the world always have problems differentiating real herbs from fakes - and there are many.&nbsp; Often, we get&nbsp;conned.&nbsp; I had been conned before too.&nbsp; I bought some cordyceps from somewhere, and once you started boiling it, it became something else!&nbsp; Can we develop the standards and the tests to help certify authentic TCM products?&nbsp; Can we aim to be the certifying body for the world market?&nbsp; Singapore is a trusted&nbsp;brand.&nbsp; I think if it comes with the&nbsp;Singapore chop, most people will trust that and say, \"Aw, done by Singapore, certified by SISIR (or now called SPRING),&nbsp;should be reasonable.\"&nbsp; That will create a whole&nbsp;new industry in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years ago, Minister George Yeo planted a seed in Ang Mo Kio Hospital&nbsp;when he started acupuncture there as a pilot.&nbsp; There have been some developments since.&nbsp; Even our Zoo finds application for TCM.&nbsp; Last week, I read Ah Meng somehow benefited from acupuncture!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am giving TCM a booster shot.&nbsp; That is why I said \u201cyes\ufffd?

practitioners to continue with their traditional way of training, often from father to son.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"<I>Die-da</I>\"&nbsp;is a branch in TCM dealing with injuries to bones and soft tissues. The correct practice of&nbsp; \"<I>die-da</I>\", like the practice of any specialty in TCM, requires full knowledge of TCM.&nbsp; That is why we require those who wish to practise \"<I>die-da</I>\"&nbsp;to undergo the complete training in TCM and be registered as TCM practitioners. This is also&nbsp;the regulatory regime&nbsp;in China and Hong Kong.&nbsp; You know at the hospital end, we have seen <p align=left>Column: 2071<p>some of the damages done by some of these so-called \"<I>die-da</I>\" practitioners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are sympathetic to the incumbents who had no opportunity for such training in the past.&nbsp; And that is why&nbsp;we&nbsp;have special provisions allowing&nbsp;them various chances to try to study and pass examinations, and quite a few do.&nbsp; A few dropped out for various reasons.&nbsp; But I think, from now on, for all&nbsp;new practitioners, we have to require them&nbsp;to be fully-trained and fully registered as TCM practitioners.&nbsp; I think let us not compromise on standards here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Sze Wee asked about the enrolment in our local TCM schools.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;two schools.&nbsp; They offer 6-year part-time&nbsp;course&nbsp;or a 3-year full-time course.&nbsp; And I am quite glad both have tied up separately with TCM universities in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, about 100 graduated from both&nbsp;schools.&nbsp; Currently, about 800 are at various stages of studying, another 200 are doing&nbsp;the 3-year full-time course. So there is&nbsp;a total of about 1,000 stretched over several years. I just read today's newspaper that NTU is starting a double degree course with Beijing TCM University.&nbsp; So there will be a few students from there too.&nbsp; I welcome that development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan asked about the impact of TCM training on western primary healthcare. But TCM has always co-existed with western medicine, playing a very useful complementary role.&nbsp; Their market share is about 12%,&nbsp;and I have been looking at those data for several years.&nbsp; It has&nbsp;remained quite stable at&nbsp;12%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Chong Weng Chiew expressed a concern that&nbsp;we may be over training.&nbsp; We have now about 1,800 on the TCM register and, as I said, there are&nbsp;1,000 still in the pipeline.&nbsp; It seems like a&nbsp;very large number.&nbsp; I have no idea whether the <p align=left>Column: 2072<p>market will be able to absorb&nbsp;1,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, as I said so yesterday, let the market work.&nbsp; But the market can only work if you provide useful information.&nbsp; What we would do and what the TCM community ought to do is to publish information, how many are you training, what is the job prospect of&nbsp;graduates.&nbsp; Like NUS and&nbsp;NTU, every year, they systematically publish within&nbsp;so many weeks or months, their graduates get jobs,&nbsp;their starting pay,&nbsp;etc. And I think the students need to know. &nbsp;My fear is that&nbsp;if you have two competing TCM schools and they start competing to produce as many as possible,&nbsp;it is&nbsp;troublesome, you&nbsp;get over-training and the students come out, they cannot find jobs.&nbsp; I do not think that will be&nbsp;fair to the students.&nbsp; I am not saying that the students are&nbsp;finding no jobs.&nbsp; I do not know enough about the industry yet.&nbsp; But I would urge the community to publish more such information into the public domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move west to our hospital clusters.&nbsp; Mr Alex Chan and Dr Chong asked whether cluster formation has achieved&nbsp;the purpose and whether excellence can be better achieved through&nbsp;a third cluster.&nbsp;Frankly speaking, the key to medical excellence is seldom due to organisational structure.&nbsp; I have seen various kinds of organisational structures among the top institutions, from Cleveland to Stanford.&nbsp;Top performance comes from leadership.&nbsp; Are the leaders serious?&nbsp; Are they clear of their goals?&nbsp; Are they able to attract like-minded people to join their cause?&nbsp; Are they ready to drop team members who are&nbsp;distracting or are distracted?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whether it is one cluster, two clusters,&nbsp;three, or five, the more important question is whether we are clear about our mission and&nbsp;do we have good people who are passionate about our vision.&nbsp; Do we know when to cooperate,<p align=left>Column: 2073<p> and when to compete?&nbsp; This is increasingly the key to winning the global competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, the only way <I>SingaporeMedicine</I> can stay ahead of competition, is for all hospitals, public and private, to work together as Singapore Inc. when it comes to professional matters.&nbsp; We fight as one team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I advised the two clusters to stop organising competing annual scientific meetings but&nbsp;jointly organise much bigger annual scientific meetings with far greater impact on the region.&nbsp; I am glad that they are taking up my suggestion.&nbsp;They are now planning to upsize the many small local professional meetings to include the professionals from the region.&nbsp; Then you have meetings involving thousands and not just a few hundreds.&nbsp; They will also share and consolidate their databases of conference participants so that we can market our meetings more effectively.&nbsp;They will also try to leverage on the many world-renowned scientists, Nobel Prize Laureates, that&nbsp;A*STAR brought into Singapore, to help project Singapore as a thought leader for all things medical.&nbsp; I am very&nbsp;cheered by this development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, one of my grassroots leaders had a mild heart attack.&nbsp; He was a former patient of SGH Heart Centre.&nbsp; He had a heart attack at home, called the ambulance and because he lived very near to Tan Tock Seng Hospital,&nbsp;the ambulance brought him there.&nbsp;After stabilising him and discovering that he was a former&nbsp;patient of SGH, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, different cluster,&nbsp;called up SGH, informed them that they were sending him over.&nbsp; They&nbsp;put&nbsp;him into an ambulance and sent him to SGH.&nbsp;&nbsp;SGH&nbsp;was ready to receive&nbsp;and admit the patient.&nbsp; He&nbsp;stayed in hospital for seven days, recovered, he came out.&nbsp; Then only he told me about his experience of a&nbsp;very pleasant encounter<p align=left>Column: 2074<p> with the two hospitals.&nbsp;Mind you, he was a subsidised patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very happy to hear his experience.&nbsp; Obviously, the rivalry between the two clusters must have eased.&nbsp; I dare not say that it has disappeared, but&nbsp;it has&nbsp;eased,&nbsp;at least in this instance,&nbsp;and SGH&nbsp; and TTSH have been able to cooperate for the welfare of their patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, it is not about how many clusters we have.&nbsp; The key is&nbsp;focus and leadership.&nbsp; What counts is how we take care of our patients at the front line, in&nbsp;the clinics and&nbsp;the wards.&nbsp;If our clusters compete to have the latest equipment, inflating pay to poach staff from each other, and shifting costs to each other, then we are headed for disaster.&nbsp; But I am confident that we have enough sense to know that the competition is not against each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is against diseases. Our focus must always be on how to improve health, how to reduce illness,&nbsp;how to do better and more with less, for the sake of all Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success will depend on whether we have the right leadership at the front line: hospital CEOs who see the larger&nbsp;picture and share the vision, and yet at the operational level, are hands-on at the helm of a tightly-run ship.&nbsp; They serve the doctors, the nurses, the frontline staff, make sure that the right systems are in place, the right people are well-trained and well-deployed, and facilities and equipment are working optimally so that our&nbsp;professionals&nbsp;can care for their patients in the best&nbsp;and least-costly manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we stay focused on the right thing and have the right people in charge, I see no reason why we cannot be the best in the region.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I think on the issue of manpower development and supply for the healthcare sector, we all agree that having an effective and adequate supply of manpower for the healthcare is extremely crucial for an effective delivery of healthcare services in Singapore.&nbsp; In this respect, there have been many developments, one of which has already been&nbsp;alluded to by the Minister when he spoke recently about the establishment of the second medical school and focusing on how to create greater specialisation and&nbsp;sub-specialisation for doctors.&nbsp;&nbsp;These developments will contribute towards developing better healthcare service through the doctors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other development is, of course, the establishment or&nbsp; allowing nurses to continue to upgrade themselves through a degree in nursing through the second medical school that is being set up.&nbsp; For a long time, this has been&nbsp;the bugbear of nurses that they have no opportunity to do so to improve themselves.&nbsp; This is definitely a step in the right direction.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry also to consider not only on the direct staff providing healthcare services, like nurses and doctors, but also to look at the para-professionals.&nbsp; Because to have an integrated, holistic healthcare delivery system, particularly with an ageing population, we do&nbsp;need para-professionals, ie,&nbsp;podiatrists, psychotherapists,&nbsp;to provide palliative care as well.&nbsp; There is some concern that this group probably has not been receiving enough attention, and there may&nbsp;also be&nbsp;a shortage of this category of para-professionals.&nbsp; So I would like to urge the Ministry to look into the needs of this group of people and also to ensure an adequate supply of such para-professionals in the public health service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Can the Minister inform the House what&nbsp;is the exact number of doctors working in the polyclinics of each cluster in each financial year from 2001 to 2004, particularly those doctors who are registered under Temporary Registration with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC).&nbsp; The reason why I ask this is that I understand that the temporary registered doctors in polyclinics are not Singaporeans.&nbsp; Singaporeans are either provisional, conditional or fully registered with&nbsp;SMC.&nbsp; Can the Minister provide the nationalities of these temporary registered doctors in the polyclinics?&nbsp; Also, can we request for this data from the cluster hospitals as well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is, what are the average salaries of our doctors, say, for a first year medical officer after his housemanship who has graduated from either NUS, or&nbsp;Singaporeans who are trained overseas, either UK, Australia or approved universities, versus the temporary registered doctors who are working and employed in the same service.&nbsp; Third, with the onset of block funding, should there be a difference between those under temporary registration and the other two categories?&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the clusters be, therefore, more inclined to hire more doctors under temporary registration versus locally-trained or overseas-trained Singaporean doctors?&nbsp; Fourth, can the Minister assure the House that, with block funding and possibly increased use of such foreign doctors under temporary registration, quality care to our Singaporeans will not be compromised in the public sector?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I understand that these doctors are registered under the&nbsp;temporary SMC registration.&nbsp; Having read through the relevant sections of the Medical Registration Act (MRA)&nbsp;on Temporary Registration, which is section<p align=left>Column: 2077<p> 23, and given the nature that these doctors are purely here to give service with skills that are already commonly available amongst Singaporean doctors, I am uncertain how they can qualify for temporary registration on such a prolonged basis.&nbsp; Temporary registration is for doctors to \"engage themselves exclusively in teaching, research and postgraduate studies in medicine\".&nbsp; These doctors are here in our polyclinics to give a service primarily.&nbsp; Therefore, would it be better to amend the MRA to create a special class of conditional registration instead?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Member Dr Lily Neo has mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, only patients who seek treatment for chronic illnesses follow up at polyclinics qualify for Government subsidies.&nbsp; However, there are limitations to the reach of our polyclinics to the needy.&nbsp; Many of the elderly sick have mobility problem and thus have difficulty going to the polyclinics without assistance.&nbsp; As a result, many of the sick, the poor elderly postpone or even to the extent of defaulting on their visits to the polyclinics until, very often, which is the<p align=left>Column: 2079<p> case, their conditions are irreversible or untreatable.&nbsp; Such situations lead to unnecessary sufferings and could result in even heavier medical bills for them subsequently and their families, as well as the taxpayers, who would subsidise the more aggressive and usually more costly treatments to help them recover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To alleviate the situation, may I suggest that the Ministry of Health consider allowing means-tested patients to seek subsidised chronic sick follow-up at private clinics.&nbsp; Our network of private clinics is excellent, at least one within walking distance of almost every HDB block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, besides giving grants to our two current health groups, would the Ministry consider allowing qualified charity welfare organisations who offer chronic sick follow-up medical services to the needy to claim similar grants?&nbsp; This way, voluntary welfare organisations can also assist in serving the poor and sick by offering subsidised services which complement those already offered by our current medical agencies.&nbsp; This would be perfectly in line with the many-helping-hands approach of our Government.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On the anecdotal feedback from my medical colleagues that the two cluster polyclinics have very different objectives and modus operandi, one is rather conservative while the other is quite aggressive, and hence the growth rates for the two polyclinic clusters are quite different.&nbsp; This has also been compounded <p align=left>Column: 2080<p>by the introduction of night polyclinics back in 2001 which led to further growth.&nbsp; If these growth rates are sustained in the future, will block funding be able to sustain these growth rates?&nbsp; If not, what can we do about it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Minister kindly furnish us with the following information:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The year-on-year growth in workload and year-on-year growth rate of the polyclinic workloads of each of the two clusters from 2000 to 2004 inclusive;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Give us the possible explanations to account for&nbsp;the differences in growth rates between the two clusters, should the rates be quite different;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the rates obtained in (1) above, does the Minister expect&nbsp;these growth rates to continue to vary very significantly in the next five years; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Reassure us that the proposed block funding mechanism will be able to continue funding these rates of increase, as given in (1) above of the two clusters' polyclinics in, say, the next five years and, if not, are there any plans to fund the polyclinics along these rates of historical expansion or to curtail demand for polyclinic services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In developed countries all over the world, it is established wisdom and common practice to \"de-market\" subsidised primary healthcare.&nbsp; The exceptions being that of immunisation, whereby it is treated as a public good with positive externalities as well as certain disease screening, such as pap smear and mammography.&nbsp; However, from the years&nbsp;2000 and 2004, it is largely perceived that the polyclinic went on a marketing spree to market its services.&nbsp; Because there is no means test currently in practice in the polyclinics, the capacity to abuse through a \"buffet mentality\" or \"moral hazard\" remains pretty large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2081<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other issue with block funding of polyclinics is the disproportionate distribution of market share between the two clusters.&nbsp; One cluster has almost two-thirds of the polyclinic cluster while on the other hand, it only has 40% market share on the hospital, ie, secondary and tertiary,&nbsp;level.&nbsp; So, it is not 50-50 down the line vertically integrated.&nbsp; Going forward, is this mal-distribution sustainable?&nbsp; With the advent of block funding, what is there to prevent one cluster from dumping subsidised patients on another cluster by getting polyclinics to refer its patients to the other cluster?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Infectious Diseases</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As brought up by Mdm Halimah Yacob yesterday as well, it was mentioned that during the SARS outbreak in 2003, Singapore did not have enough infectious disease specialists and public health specialists.&nbsp; Can the Minister inform the House how many doctors have been recruited for the Basic Specialty Training (BST) and the Advanced Specialty (AST) for the disciplines of infectious disease and public health respectively?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</B> Sir, I would like to thank the hon. Members, Mdm Halimah Yacob, Dr Tan Sze Wee, Dr Chong Weng Chiew and Dr Lily Neo for their comments.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Dr Tan asked about the medical manpower situation.&nbsp; Dr Tan made particular reference to the polyclinic.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, manpower planning in healthcare is not an exact science.&nbsp; As we recently announced, there will be a second medical school.&nbsp; This school will take 25 students in its first batch in 2007.&nbsp; They will be housemen in 2011,&nbsp;finish their advanced training around 2017, and&nbsp;become specialist consultants around 2020, ie, about 15 years from now.&nbsp; Likewise, the <p align=left>Column: 2082<p>number of doctors and specialists we have today was influenced by the admission policies of the last 30 years.&nbsp; Fortunately, the number of doctors working here is not solely dependent on rigid manpower planning.&nbsp; This is because a significant number of Singaporeans study medicine abroad and a number of them return home to work.&nbsp; We also take in foreign doctors who have augmented our numbers.&nbsp; And&nbsp;we&nbsp;have Singaporean doctors who leave to work abroad in the US, UK and Hong Kong.&nbsp; They reduce the local supply but they are an asset to Singapore because they form a Singapore network around the world that we can tap into. &nbsp;Just as Singapore hospitals recruit foreign doctors, foreign countries try to recruit our doctors. &nbsp;Some time ago, there was a team from the&nbsp;UK which visited Singapore. &nbsp;It was led by a distinguished surgeon and they were trying to recruit surgeons for the NHS.&nbsp; Three years ago, two of my former neurosurgical trainees who became consultant neurosurgeons were offered salaries of US$500,000 each, tax-free, to work in an oil-rich country.&nbsp; They turned down the offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there is a global market for skilled medical manpower. &nbsp;Our healthcare system works within this market. &nbsp;The global market helps us import doctors in the areas where there is a shortage and allows our doctors to work abroad if there is a temporary oversupply in any specific area.&nbsp; In the same way, there is a global market for nurses and the health sciences professionals like physiotherapists and radiotherapists.&nbsp; Our nurses are targeted by foreign recruiters.&nbsp; I am told that the recruiters hand out leaflets to nurses at the bus-stops and MRT stations serving the public hospitals.&nbsp; The existence of a global market means that we have to pay globally-competitive wages if we are to hold on to our healthcare workers.&nbsp; But it also means that we can meet shortfalls in our manpower requirements by recruiting foreign-trained workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2083<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 7,000 doctors registered by the SMC, about a fifth are foreign-trained.&nbsp; They have been a plus to our healthcare system.&nbsp; Let me give two examples of foreign-born foreign-trained doctors who have contributed to our healthcare system.&nbsp; Prof Abu Rauff and Dr K C Tan are foreign-born and did not graduate from the local university.&nbsp; Prof Rauff was Chief of Surgery at NUS and was teacher to many of the top surgeons in practice today.&nbsp; Dr K C Tan is, of course, Singapore's liver transplant surgeon who saved both Ms Andrea D'Cruz and Mr Suleiman when their livers failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By welcoming talented foreign doctors, our healthcare system has been able to deliver better care to the public.&nbsp; There is no reason to discriminate against them.&nbsp; In answer to Dr Tan, there is no difference in the pay structure between foreign-trained and locally-trained doctors.&nbsp; The starting salary for medical officers is around $3,500 a month. &nbsp;Temporarily-registered doctors receive less because they have to be supervised. &nbsp;Those on temporary registration who perform well should eventually be given full registration.&nbsp; In answer to&nbsp;his specific question on the number of temporarily-registered doctors, there are 219.&nbsp; They work in both clusters&nbsp;and about 30 of them are in the polyclinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at medical manpower, we need to also consider the distribution of doctors between the various specialties.&nbsp; Specialisation makes it difficult to redeploy medical manpower.&nbsp; The United States, which has a sophisticated training system, has 24 specialties and includes family medicine as one of the 24 specialties. &nbsp;Singapore has 35 specialties, and we exclude family medicine.&nbsp; Specialisation creates silos with walls that prevent the movement of work or doctors across specialties.&nbsp; Even within specialties, doctors sub-specialise further and are reluctant to be deployed elsewhere within the specialty.&nbsp; This can create a relative<p align=left>Column: 2084<p> over-supply or under-supply within the specialty.&nbsp; For example, since the number of deliveries in our public hospitals has dropped from an annual peak of about 40,000 to less than 20,000, the number of neonatal beds should be halved.&nbsp; Instead, the neonatal specialists tell me the number of beds remains the same and that they are working at 110%.&nbsp; When there were 40,000 births, the neonatal specialists had the modest goal of reaching a standard equal to that&nbsp;in a good hospital in the UK or Australia.&nbsp; Now, they want to be one of the top three centres in the world.&nbsp; With more than enough skilled manpower, relative to deliveries, they can set themselves this goal.&nbsp; The neonatal specialists are a dedicated and hardworking group, and they may achieve their goal.&nbsp; I am proud of their work.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is an example of supply-induced demand. Since the supply of neonatal specialists has increased greatly in relation to the number of deliveries,</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>they have just set higher standards for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua yesterday expressed concern about the high cost of drugs and diagnostic tests. The clusters buy in bulk and this has reduced the cost of medicines. With regard to radiological tests, there are many new diagnostic machines. In countries like the US, rules have been relaxed so that other specialists are allowed to own and operate these diagnostic machines. This is not yet the case in Singapore. Our regulations reduce the supply of specialists who are allowed to operate the machines to only radiologists. The cost of radiological investigations in Singapore is sometimes twice that of neighbouring countries. This is not a problem restricted to the private hospitals. The MRI and CT scan charges at our restructured hospitals may, in some cases, be higher than the private sector. Patients bear this cost. MOH will study<p align=left>Column: 2085<p> how to safely deregulate and introduce more supply and more competition so that the unit cost for radiological tests is brought down. This will benefit patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have given these examples to show that market principles apply in healthcare and, at the same time, to show how supply can create its own demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the market to work, our hospitals must have autonomy in making decisions on how they employ their doctors and what&nbsp;services they wish to provide. So, in answer to Dr Tan on the differences between the clusters, there must be differences because&nbsp;NHG and Singhealth do not have identical practices. They&nbsp;have the autonomy to make their own management decisions and compete with each other. This gives patients choice and the competition between the two will lead to better service and lower costs. They have different manpower recruiting strategies and different plans for future expansion. The CEOs of the clusters, hospitals and polyclinics are on the ground and they are in the best position to make decisions. I believe MOH should not try and micromanage the polyclinics or hospitals.&nbsp; And we should not unnecessarily set restrictions on them on what they should do in 2007.&nbsp; I do not have a crystal ball to look into and say in 2007 what the situation will be and what decisions they should make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah wanted to know what the doctor-patient ratio was. She was concerned about the number of doctors we&nbsp;have.&nbsp; In&nbsp;2000,&nbsp;it was 1:720 population. It is now 1:650 population. So there has been an improvement.&nbsp; The second medical school will increase the supply of new doctors starting&nbsp;seven years from now. At the same time, we are going to need more doctors as our population ages. So looking ahead, I think supply will match demand, but even if the <p align=left>Column: 2086<p>two did not match up exactly, any shortfalls or excesses will be evened out by the global market place in healthcare manpower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah was also concerned about&nbsp;other health sciences professionals.&nbsp; I agree with her. We must support the training and development of other healthcare professionals like nurses and the allied healthcare workers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo highlighted the problems of chronic diseases in the elderly. Looking after the chronic diseases of the elderly will become the biggest sector in healthcare. With our high healthcare standards, Singaporeans can look forward to living into their 80s and 90s. This is good news. But it also means many will&nbsp;develop one of&nbsp;six chronic diseases in their lifetime, namely,&nbsp;hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer or dementia. We must therefore be able to manage these diseases better and in a holistic manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, many members of the public think that specialist care is better than the care of a GP or a polyclinic doctor. Perhaps, this is because of the word \"specialist\", which is derived from the word \"special\". So patients think they get ordinary care from a GP and special care from a specialist.&nbsp; This is not so. The \"special\" refers not to special care, but to a special part of your body.&nbsp; The part of your body considered special is not really special&nbsp;- it could be your liver, or your lung or your colon or skin. &nbsp;It is considered \"special\" by the doctor because that is the usual part of the body he treats. So depending on the number of parts your body is divided into, you will need that many specialists to look after you. A specialist is therefore a body-part expert and not a whole-body expert.&nbsp; I have said there are 35 specialties in Singapore. If we exclude pediatrics and obstetrics, which I presume a man will not need, a man may need 33 specialists for his care.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2087<p> So that is why many patients in our hospitals end up seeing multiple doctors which costs them a great deal.&nbsp; Even then, sometimes things are missed because there will be gaps between the body parts covered by the specialists looking after the patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to educate the public that GPs, family physicians and polyclinic doctors are experts in looking after the whole body just as specialists are experts in looking after one part of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chronic sick often have multiple problems and they need holistic care. The polyclinics will be piloting specialist Family Clinics to look after chronic diseases. They will start with clinics that will look after hypertension and diabetes. They will announce the details when they are ready to roll out the service. If the pilot is successful, then GPs can be brought into the system to provide holistic care.&nbsp; We will study how best to model this scheme, possibly similar to the PCPS scheme, as suggested by Dr Lily Neo.&nbsp; Similarly, we can study how VWOs can be involved in chronic care, as suggested by Dr Chong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking after the elderly requires a \"many helping hands\" approach.&nbsp; The grassroots can take the lead. And if any technical assistance is needed, my Ministry will help.&nbsp; I agree with Dr Chong that VWOs can play an important part in looking after the chronic sick. Like MOH, VWOs can employ competent doctors to provide primary health care. But there is a difference between MOH and a VWO. The great strength of the VWO is that it is a people-driven organisation, and that means it is an organisation with a heart that beats in tune with the community and that it is closer to the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan&nbsp;had asked about the adequacy of infectious disease manpower. There are 18 infectious disease specialists, of whom 15 are in the public sector. There are also over 70 trained public health specialists<p align=left>Column: 2088<p> and there are about 10 trainees in each speciality. For the exact details on the numbers, we can send it to the Member. Is this enough? Having more specialists is always better but I think our numbers are adequate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November, I had forecast that the rate of increase of AIDS was such that, in 2004, we will cross the 300 mark in terms of new cases diagnosed. The final tally is in.&nbsp; Sadly, the total number of new cases for 2004 was 311.&nbsp; In 2003, the number of new cases was 242. This means there was a year-on-year increase of 28%. Currently, 90% of these newly diagnosed patients are males, with one-third&nbsp;being gays. We had a low prevalence rate of HIV in the past, even in the gay community. We do not know the reasons for the sharp increase of HIV in the gay community. &nbsp;An epidemiologist has suggested that this may be linked to the annual predominantly gay party in Sentosa - the Nation Party - which allowed gays from high prevalence societies to fraternise with local gay men, seeding the infection in the local community.&nbsp; However, this is a hypothesis and more research needs to done by the experts.&nbsp; The reported new cases are only the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; In total, we have more than 2,000 HIV/AIDS patients. But for every AIDS patient we have diagnosed, there are possibly&nbsp;two to&nbsp;four undiagnosed patients with HIV in Singapore. That means there could be anywhere between 4,000&nbsp;and 8,000 undiagnosed HIV patients in Singapore.&nbsp; Last month, there was an alarming report from the US.&nbsp; The AIDS virus has mutated and the new virus is drug-resistant and kills quickly. Even those who are already HIV-positive can get infected by this strain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We therefore have to make testing simpler for people at risk. MOH is currently studying the introduction of over-the-counter HIV test kits.&nbsp; These test kits are easy to use because they test the <p align=left>Column: 2089<p>saliva. Any member of the public should be able to do it themselves.&nbsp; This will allow those at risk to test themselves.&nbsp; If those with HIV are diagnosed early, they could receive treatment early and hence minimise the development of complications.&nbsp; They could also take&nbsp;precautions so that they do not spread the disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, we made testing of HIV in pregnant mothers an opt-out option. This increased the overall screening rate from 37% to 77%.&nbsp; As a result of screening, in the last two months, we have saved at least one child from getting infected.&nbsp; MOH is studying proposals to make testing of pregnant mothers compulsory so that we can achieve 100% screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, besides gays, the other major risk group are heterosexual men who have casual sex. In many cases, this puts the wife at risk.&nbsp;In countries where the AIDS epidemic is full-blown, the majority of AIDS patients are women. This is because it is easier for the infection to move from man to woman than from woman to man. Currently, 10% of AIDS patients in Singapore are women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not act to protect women, many women will get infected and we will have a situation where women form the majority of AIDS patients. Do we want this to happen?&nbsp; There is a need to balance the right to confidentiality of the AIDS patient with the right to protect those at risk. The current legislation appears to be tilted in favour of the patient and exposes the spouse to the risk of catching AIDS.&nbsp; It also prevents the healthcare system from performing its public health duties. This is one reason why the AIDS epidemic is not coming under control. We need to treat AIDS like any other public health problem. We must give public health workers the tools needed to screen for the infection and contact-trace the infection.&nbsp; We need to protect the women of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 2090<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a reluctance to deal pro-actively with AIDS because of the fear that the AIDS patient will be discriminated. Hence, many measures were put in place which hindered efforts to diagnose HIV. But if the HIV patient is not diagnosed and even the person who is HIV-positive does not know he has HIV, how can we effectively stop the transmission of the disease?&nbsp; We need to de-stigmatise testing and, at the same time, we must prevent discrimination against AIDS patients. A lot of education is going to be needed.&nbsp; And the Health Promotion Board in Singapore will be busy this year working on this.&nbsp; Those who test positive for HIV should be able to lead normal lives in society. MOH will consult with the public and stakeholders before proposing any legislative changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there was some fear expressed by Dr Tan&nbsp;over the block budget system&nbsp;affecting clinical services. Minister Khaw has outlined to this House our approach towards block budgeting.&nbsp; There is no perfect health system. The health administrator has to work in a market-based system and is forced to be as efficient as he can. At the same time, the block budget ensures that the overall growth of the healthcare sector is moderated so that healthcare remains affordable. So, in answer to Dr Tan, the clusters will have to see what their block budget is and then determine what service they should expand.&nbsp; If they think polyclinic services should be expanded more because there is such an overwhelming demand, then that is what they should expand.&nbsp; If they think they should invest more in inpatient services, that is what they should do.&nbsp; I do not think we want to set a rigid guideline for what they should do over the next five years and then guarantee this House that that is what they are going to do and guarantee that&nbsp;the block budget should be&nbsp;used for that.&nbsp; As far as possible, we should let those on the ground decide how best to use the funds available</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I would like to ask MOH for the policy planning on the medical needs of the elderly in the next 10-25 years when the elderly population will increase from 14% to 20% of the population.&nbsp; Such a policy planning should be prioritised by MOH so that the heavy burden in the future will be cushioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What progress has MOH achieved to provide for the three-fold increase in the resident population above the age of 65 in 25 years' time?&nbsp; Are there plans to increase the capacity of the various healthcare services such as acute hospital services, nursing homes, day centres, community daycare centres?&nbsp; May I urge MOH to ensure that we do not leave it too late for this provision in the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask if MOH agrees that homecare in Singapore is at its infancy and if MOH considers homecare as an integral part of healthcare in an ageing population?&nbsp; Does MOH see it as a priority presently and, if so, would MOH <p align=left>Column: 2092<p>develop homecare services in professional medical caregivers, domiciliary services, daycare with rehabilitation facilities, occupational therapy services, as well as equipment and adaptations at homes?&nbsp; Would it also look at a variety of inter-related needs such as nutrition, nursing, medication and mobility management and, thus, the services of personnel, transport and domestic support?&nbsp; Should MOH involve the community help and community volunteers to deliver part of the homecare services?&nbsp; Most caregivers in the community are family members and maids.&nbsp; Would MOH help to provide the proper know-how and homecare support?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MOH should aim to provide seamless integrated care services for all discharged elderly patients from public hospitals to placement of patients to stepdown care facilities that look into their medical, social and psycho-social needs.&nbsp; Would MOH ensure coordination and effective implementation of these services and make them user-friendly as well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Member,&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo.&nbsp; She always has the privilege to mention those points before me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry has introduced subsidies for homecare providers three years ago.&nbsp; I think that is in line with the Ministry's objective of promoting homecare or rather home-based or community-based care as compared to institutional care.&nbsp; However, currently, the subsidy does not extend to many other services including home therapy services.&nbsp; Thus, I&nbsp;hope&nbsp;the Ministry will&nbsp;reconsider this decision in view of our growing ageing population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An increasing number of elderly Singaporeans will require physiotherapy<p align=left>Column: 2093<p> and other follow-up care services that are conducted at their homes and in the community.&nbsp; This is because many elderly people are either living alone or are alone in the day, when their children or caregivers are at work.&nbsp; Hence, they are home-bound.&nbsp; Yes, there are daycare centres at various locations island-wide but, even so, elderly with mobility problems will have problem accessing&nbsp;these services.&nbsp; In addition, not every estate has daycare centres.&nbsp; In fact, those people who will benefit maximally from therapy are actually those who are home-bound.&nbsp; If a person has the ability to go to a daycare centre for rehabilitation, probably his disability is not as bad as one who is home-bound.&nbsp; Thus, without MOH's subsidy, the elderly poor will not be able to benefit from treatment and therapy just when they need them most.&nbsp; If the Ministry could subsidise such services, many elderly will benefit from this improvement in their health, as well as their quality of life.&nbsp; Thus, I&nbsp;hope that the Ministry will review its position on this policy.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman):</B> Sir, I thank Dr Lily Neo and Dr Cheong Weng Chiew for sharing their views and concerns, especially with regard to the elderly population.&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree that there are immense challenges in transforming our healthcare sector, and in ensuring more efficient use of resources, as well as&nbsp;more effective delivery of services.&nbsp; The MPs have highlighted the importance of a multi-pronged and seamless approach for public health policies and programmes, from preventive healthcare to ensuring that the services are delivered to the elderly population.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the healthcare service delivery in both the private and public sectors remains fragmented.&nbsp; Both of them are healthcare practitioners, and they are in a <p align=left>Column: 2094<p>better position to understand&nbsp;and to know that.&nbsp; This lack of integration gives rise to disconnects in service delivery and optimal healthcare outcomes.&nbsp; Except within small groupings of providers, there is very little sharing of critical information, when a patient moves from one provider to another.&nbsp; To compound the issue, we continue to be&nbsp;concerned with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, each of which can cause significant health and financial burden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tremendous effort lies ahead of us,&nbsp;and to date the progress has been slow.&nbsp; The technology needed to link up different health care providers has existed for many years, yet very few, if any, providers have taken the initiative to come together.&nbsp; Why is this so?&nbsp; Many chronic diseases can be detected early and actions taken to prevent their deterioration.&nbsp; Prevention or delayed onset of such diseases will help individuals achieve a higher quality of life, as well as lower their healthcare costs.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to address this more systematically. To have better disease management and proper care for the chronically-ill, it is crucial that we continue to transform our healthcare delivery system innovatively and on various fronts.&nbsp; More of the same certainly is not sustainable.&nbsp; With the advice and wisdom from our MPs who understand the issues on the ground, we are confident that these problems could be overcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate this journey of change, the <I>Health.connect</I> concept that was mentioned in this House last year has now been fleshed out in more detail and piloted in the Jurong area since July 2004.&nbsp; <I>Jurong Health.connect</I> is an initiative that MPs like Mdm Halimah, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Dr Lily Neo and Mr Ahmad Khalis are actively involved in, with the strong backing by Mr Lim Boon Heng.&nbsp; This is not an easy pioneering effort.&nbsp; <I>Jurong<p align=left>Column: 2095<p> Health.connect</I> requires active support to integrate healthcare services across both public and private healthcare sectors, across hospital and step-down care, across carers and patients.&nbsp; When completed, it will deliver holistic care from all providers working as a team, with the Electronic Medical Records as the backbone.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start with the first transformation needed in preventive healthcare.&nbsp; One key to a successful healthcare system is the early detection of diseases.&nbsp; Thus a primary component of <I>Health.connect</I> is health screening.&nbsp; Today, we have many players who reach out to different subsets of the community for health screening, under the&nbsp;Check Your Health programme, NKF screenings and ad-hoc outreach projects conducted by NGOs and religious groups. The GPs and polyclinics also conduct opportunistic screenings for their patients.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no consistent health screening standard that these providers adopt,&nbsp;resulting in disparate datasets that are not effectively managed&nbsp;for useful analysis.&nbsp; Follow-up for those who require further attention is not systematically monitored. <I>Jurong Health.connect</I> is moving forward in this regard, with various providers agreeing on a standard screening approach.&nbsp; There is a call centre.&nbsp; The call centre under the <I>Health.connect</I> framework will reach out to those identified as needing further attention, allowing early intervention to manage the disease.&nbsp; This is part of the seamless process that we want to try to facilitate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the launch of the call centre hotline and website in mid-October 2004, the last four months or so, &nbsp;it has fielded more than 100 calls, with 36 referrals generated, within the community.&nbsp; Cases helped by JHC include, for example,&nbsp;a woman who obtained a referral for a home nursing service for her 100-year-old<p align=left>Column: 2096<p> mother who was recently discharged from hospital.&nbsp; Another example is a&nbsp;woman who obtained information on services for her mentally-disadvantaged uncle.&nbsp; These cases were given information and access, referrals to facilities that are within the community.&nbsp; JHC is gradually building up a network, one step at a time, to link up healthcare providers in that area.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we applaud the move towards better coordination of early screening, it remains a great challenge.&nbsp; Although the Government keeps the cost of screening affordable, we need more Singaporeans to be forthcoming.&nbsp; For example, a few years ago when a Community Health Screening Programme was launched to detect diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol, at minimal charge, only a quarter of the target group turned up.&nbsp; The situation has now improved for ad-hoc screening programmes with larger numbers turning up, but not for regular periodic screenings.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The feedback from our healthcare providers and partners is that people&nbsp;do not realise the importance of regular check-ups, or of follow-ups, after an initial diagnosed medical condition.&nbsp; Singaporeans must do their part in preventive healthcare.&nbsp; We have provided the infrastructure, created the opportunities, but they must come forward for the screenings as well as follow-ups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on a broader level, preventive healthcare is about healthy living.&nbsp; MOH and the Health Promotion Board actively encourage Singaporeans to lead healthy lifestyles, so that they remain healthy and disease-free for as long as possible.&nbsp; Promoting healthy lifestyle requires a multi-pronged approach to reach out to different segments of our population, such as school children, working adults and the elderly.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a significant proportion of our population being working adults,<p align=left>Column: 2097<p> employers have an important role to play.&nbsp; In 2003, the National Workplace Health Promotion Survey showed that 86% of the Singapore workforce has access to a comprehensive Workplace Health Promotion (WHP) programme. We hope they capitalise on the opportunities that are presented.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, international studies show that adopting a healthy lifestyle could significantly reduce the risk of chronic diseases.&nbsp; It would also significantly reduce the individual's healthcare spending.&nbsp; Research in the US, for example, has found that healthcare spending for obese Americans accounted for 27% of the growth of overall healthcare spending, and healthcare cost incurred by the obese individuals was 37% higher than that&nbsp;of normal weight individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is some good news at home.&nbsp; Preliminary results from our latest National Health Survey in 2004 show that Singaporeans are exercising more and smoking less. 24% of adult Singaporeans now exercise regularly, up from 17% during the previous survey.&nbsp; The proportion of smokers has fallen from 15% in 1998 to 13%, although there is a worrying prevalence of young female smokers.&nbsp; Singaporeans with diabetes declined from 9% to 8%, with high blood pressure also falling from 22% to 20%, and with high blood cholesterol falling also from 25% to 19%.&nbsp; This is between 1998 and 2004.&nbsp; The survey is conducted every six years. These figures are indeed very encouraging.&nbsp; But, whether this improvement is sustainable remains to be seen.&nbsp; We will, however, continue our efforts to&nbsp;encourage Singaporeans to remain healthy.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Lily Neo&nbsp;raised some pertinent concerns with regard to the elderly population.&nbsp; I thank her for being a <p align=left>Column: 2098<p>constant voice for our senior citizens, and constantly reminding us of the plight of this group of Singaporeans.&nbsp; We acknowledge that as our society ages, more effort will have to be put in place to meet the health care needs of the population.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have put in place an active programme of primary prevention&nbsp; and early detection and management of chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes for Singaporeans at large as well as specifically for the elderly population.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier the HPB's \u201cCheck Your Health\ufffd? programme and other community health screening programmes, which&nbsp;are being enhanced to encourage more participation by the elderly.&nbsp; The cost is kept&nbsp;very affordable and the screenings are conducted on Sundays in HDB town centres to increase accessibility to&nbsp;the elderly.&nbsp; Where possible, the elderly are personally invited to undergo the screening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those elderly who have acute medical conditions, our polyclinics and hospitals are able to provide&nbsp; them with affordable&nbsp;care.&nbsp; We have set up the Integrated Care Services (ICS)&nbsp; in 2001, to ensure the proper discharge and post-hospitalisation handling of elderly patients, and that they are able to access long-term care if required.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>To date, there have been 7,000 referrals through the ICS, 70% of which&nbsp;have been referred to nursing homes.&nbsp; The remaining cases either had families which found alternative arrangements or&nbsp;were not suitable for nursing homes,&nbsp;and some&nbsp;subsequently would have passed away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elderly who require step-down care can access a comprehensive range of institutional and community step-down facilities&nbsp;-&nbsp;community hospitals, nursing homes, day rehabilitation services and home medical/nursing services&nbsp;-&nbsp;which <p align=left>Column: 2099<p>are subsidised by the Ministry.&nbsp; The ICS has been effective in reducing the waiting time for nursing homes, from&nbsp;three months to&nbsp;two weeks .&nbsp;&nbsp;This is with regard specifically to the concerns that Dr Lily Neo raised to ensure that there is seamless process of ensuring the patients who need step-down care when they are discharged from hospitals are taken care of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MOH is also working to improve referrals to day rehabilitation centres and other community facilities through further publicity with public hospitals as well as community referral mechanisms like the <I>Jurong Health.connect.</I>&nbsp; We will continuously review our processes to ensure that the movement of patients from acute hospitals to step-down facilities is quick and smooth for patients and their families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provision of health care services in an ageing population will continue to be a challenge for us.&nbsp; MOH is working with its partners, including agencies like MCYS, People's Association, the Singapore Sports Council, VWOs, CDCs and other&nbsp;grassroots organisations, to look after the health of elderly Singaporeans. We will continue to monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of these elderly care facilities.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above and other inter-agency ageing issues are discussed through the key platform of the Committee on Aging Issues, co-chaired by SMS Balaji and myself.&nbsp; Recognising the multi-faceted nature of aging issues, this committee comprises relevant agencies such as MCYS, MOH, MND, MOT and MOF, as well as the people sector.&nbsp; We recognise and we realise that elderly issues are not the responsibility of only one particular Ministry, but it is a combination of the responsibilities of various different Ministries. So this platform of the Committee on Aging Issues will address those concerns that are relevant and related to the elderly population.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2100<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to date, a sizable number of ideas are being discussed for testing.&nbsp; The committee is also currently deliberating on the Eldercare Master Plan for the next&nbsp;five years.&nbsp; Dr Neo asked for the next 20-30 years.&nbsp; I think it is reasonable to work towards a five-year plan with a long-term understanding of what the implications are of the elderly population several years down the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Healthcare is one main issue affecting the elderly which the committee will monitor closely and provide further recommendations to ensure the healthcare concerns of the elderly population are addressed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Chong Weng Chiew raised the issue of home rehabilitation services for home-bound patients, just like Dr Lily Neo also.&nbsp; Indeed, we are keen to ensure that the elderly are placed with their family and within the community as far as possible.&nbsp; This ensures that the primary responsibility of the family is not compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, MOH is already subsidising a range of home care and day rehabilitation services for the elderly who live in their own homes.&nbsp; The subsidies cover: (a) home medical and home nursing services by 14 VWOs;&nbsp;and (b) 27 day rehabilitation centres and therapy services, many located in HDB void decks.&nbsp; In addition, the current capacity of existing services for the elderly can be stretched.&nbsp; For example, the day rehabilitation centres can be further utilised, as&nbsp;the&nbsp;current utilisation rate is only 63%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our low-income elderly patients today already have access to subsidised rehabilitation, therapy and home care services in the community.&nbsp; We are assessing the availability and cost effectiveness of alternative services in the community, as well as the level of need in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2101<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo asked whether the current services are adequate and whether we have any projections in terms of the need.&nbsp; At this point in time, the home care nursing services are very well subscribed.&nbsp; We have over 6,000 users of home nursing services and&nbsp;over 800 users of home medical services.&nbsp; We do not have an existing waiting list.&nbsp; I think we will continue to monitor the extent of need of the elderly population for both home medical and home nursing.&nbsp; And we certainly will look into how best we can further develop the services to ensure the needs are continually met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;a service like home therapy, as suggested by Dr Chong,&nbsp;requires one-to-one despatch of a therapist to a patient's home to provide rehabilitation services and comes at significant cost.&nbsp; And because of high subsidies required, it&nbsp;is not sustainable if the numbers are not big.&nbsp; So what we try to do now is actually to ensure that the medical and the nursing needs of the elderly who are home-bound are met first, bring them to a level that they may be able to travel with aid to the community rehabilitation facilities and then subsequently ensuring that they get the rehabilitation services that are already available in the community.&nbsp; I think the rehabilitation services in the community are sufficient because, as I mentioned earlier, the utilisation rate is now at 63%.&nbsp; We want to make effective use of those resources that have already been put in place.&nbsp; The principle behind it is to ensure that services are available close to the community such that more can access those services.&nbsp; If access is an issue, then we have to look at access issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry is aware of Dr Chong's point that there are some elderly patients in need of rehabilitation who have problems travelling to day rehabilitation centres.&nbsp; Today, there are a small number of private and non-Government<p align=left>Column: 2102<p> organisations, with some private foundation support, which offer home therapy.&nbsp; Some home nurses and therapists help develop home exercise programmes&nbsp;and train family members and caregivers to give simple physiotherapy for these elderly disabled until they can be brought to day rehabilitation centres for therapy.&nbsp; We will monitor the current situation.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the healthcare system is indeed a complex issue with many dimensions - quality of service, efficiency, cost, to name just a few.&nbsp; The solution is not simply to build more hospitals and clinics or to keep on expanding our existing services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that making the system work requires the co-operation of all the stakeholders - the Government, healthcare providers, and the people.&nbsp; The Government has put in preventive programmes including screening, and is investing in more public health education programmes&nbsp;which promote a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; Singaporeans must take ownership for their well-being and go for regular screening and any necessary follow-ups.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Health.connect</I> is an innovative experiment towards achieving seamless health care for our community - the issue that Dr Lily Neo raised.&nbsp; Health screening is an important step under <I>Health.connect</I>, but it is just a&nbsp;first step.&nbsp; Those patients who need acute treatment will enjoy seamless access to an appropriate treatment centre or hospital, accessed within the community as far as possible.&nbsp; Once discharged, <I>Health.connect</I> will facilitate the return and reintegration of these patients into the community through step-down facilities, including home medical and nursing care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The small steps we take with Jurong today will one day lead us to a new model of healthcare delivery for Singapore.&nbsp; It will not be an easy journey.&nbsp; If successful, we may eventually have one nation-wide<p align=left>Column: 2103<p> <I>Health.connect</I>&nbsp;which integrates and delivers healthcare to all Singaporeans who require it.

And where we can work together to improve the welfare of Singaporeans through better health, that is what we should do.&nbsp; But in practical terms, I have got to make sure all this starts from the public hospitals first.&nbsp; Then I am on moral high ground when I tell the private GPs or private hospitals to&nbsp;join me in this cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo is helping us out in a significant way in the <I>Jurong HealthConnect</I> that Dr Maliki mentioned just now.&nbsp; That is a huge skunk works, pioneering work. Nobody is doing it in the world.&nbsp; We are at least attempting to try to solve this problem.&nbsp; I outlined this concept last year at the&nbsp;Budget debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very happy that Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Dr Lily Neo, now, Mdm Halimah, and others are chipping in because it is a challenge.&nbsp; At the same time, if we can get it fixed, I think we would have made a major contribution to transforming how we deliver healthcare.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the end point?&nbsp; The end point is that everybody begins to look at the patient as a person.&nbsp; And we are all partners, as a team,&nbsp;trying to bring about&nbsp;better health&nbsp;for this patient.&nbsp; Instead of I looking at you, when you step into my hospital, then I am interested in you, and the moment you are discharged, goodbye; or the moment you walk into my clinic, I am interested in you, and the moment you leave, sorry, you are another digit, another medical record.&nbsp; But to bring that about, there are huge challenges.&nbsp; Fortunately, technology is beginning to help us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So yesterday, when I outlined the vision of&nbsp;one Singaporean, one electronic medical record,&nbsp;it is crucial.&nbsp; Because without that infrastructure, how can I<p align=left>Column: 2106<p> share information with the GPs?&nbsp; Because, today, you may come and see me; tomorrow, you may walk into another private doctor.&nbsp; But how to share it?&nbsp; You require this infrastructure.&nbsp; From the IT planning point of view, it is no big deal.&nbsp; We only have 4 million people. So it is actually only four million electronic medical records.&nbsp; What is the big deal?&nbsp; In the financial sector, all those multinationals, like CitiCorp,&nbsp;you can go anywhere in the world, there are ATM machines, you have got the right password, and you&nbsp;can access your account.&nbsp; And that is global.&nbsp; Why can we not do it in the tiny little place called Singapore?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who has done it in the world?&nbsp; Nobody has done it.&nbsp; I have a certain sense of optimism that because we are small, we are compact, we are better organised, and more importantly,&nbsp;the political leaders here enjoy a certain level of goodwill and trust by the people that we can have a better chance of making it happen.&nbsp; And if we do, then I think we will have made a major contribution to the whole practice of healthcare which can be a model for the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last point is about exodus.&nbsp; I used that word&nbsp;in relation to Mr Low Thia Khiang's comment yesterday.&nbsp; He said, and quite rightly so, that the elderly premiums are high, a few hundred dollars.&nbsp; But at a stage when you are probably on&nbsp;pension,&nbsp;no income, and yet your premium is high.&nbsp; So he says, \"Why can't we average it out?\"&nbsp; So for MediShield insurance, average it out means everybody pays the same rate, young or old. It&nbsp;means the young subsidise the old.&nbsp; But I reminded him that&nbsp;the premium range is as wide as $30 for the young per year to over $500.&nbsp; So, if we&nbsp;average it out, it&nbsp;means that it may be around $300&nbsp;to $400.&nbsp; That means&nbsp;we expect&nbsp;everybody&nbsp;to pay $300 to&nbsp;$400, instead of&nbsp;$30 today.&nbsp; That is 10 times more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2107<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can he guarantee that there will be no exodus of the young from MediShield?&nbsp; Because if there is, we will be in trouble.&nbsp; Then what is left would be all the old people,&nbsp;and what have we achieved?&nbsp; So that was when I used the word \"exodus\" in that light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we still have 5 minutes, let me elaborate a little bit about the young and old.&nbsp; This is a very complicated subject - young subsidising the old.&nbsp; There are two aspects to it.&nbsp; Are you talking about today's young, like Miss Penny Low, supporting tomorrow's old when Miss Penny Low becomes older&nbsp;20-30 years down the road?&nbsp; That is one aspect.&nbsp; The other aspect is today's young, again using Miss Penny Low as an example, subsidising today's Khaw Boon Wan.&nbsp; The first aspect is easier to handle and is probably more equitable.&nbsp; You are talking about the same person.&nbsp; We are just saying, \"All right, when you are young and working, you pay more, so that when you grow old, you get these services.\"&nbsp; I have incorporated that into our MediShield reform.&nbsp; So we have a loyalty programme.&nbsp; The longer you stay with MediShield, when you become&nbsp;70 years old, you will stand to get discounts as high as 40% off.&nbsp; So that is cross subsidy.&nbsp; That aspect can be settled that way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other aspect is more complicated - today's young subsidising today's old.&nbsp; The westerners did that.&nbsp; All the welfare states in the world \"pay as you earn\".&nbsp; And that is how the pension scheme was developed.&nbsp; It is wonderful when your demographics are in your favour.&nbsp; So for decades, it is the most kind and&nbsp;gentle system that one can evolve.&nbsp; But when they now go into the second half of the demographics curve, when the old are growing while the young are not growing, especially with very low birth rates, they know they are heading into insolvency.&nbsp; So if you read the newspaper reports, all the pension reforms, all the huge debates in <p align=left>Column: 2108<p>the US and&nbsp;Europe are all over the same issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a young society.&nbsp; I think we better learn from these older societies their problems.&nbsp; It is a huge trap that you are creating if you try to follow them.&nbsp; This is not to say that the young should not subsidise the old.&nbsp; But I think we have to subsidise it in a way which is sustainable for the long term.&nbsp; So what is Singapore's solution?&nbsp; What we have evolved over the years is top-ups.&nbsp; So whenever the economy can support, we top up.&nbsp; Whenever there&nbsp;are good budget surpluses, we set aside&nbsp;in endownment funds.&nbsp; And I think that way it is a much more sustainable model.&nbsp; More importantly, we make sure that we do not take away the role played&nbsp;traditionally by families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an Asian tradition&nbsp;that parents&nbsp;sacrifice for the young and when they&nbsp;become old, the young people, when they can earn money,&nbsp;support their parents. But society comes in to supplement.&nbsp; So filial piety, which was mentioned by Dr Chong Weng Chiew just now, is a&nbsp;fundamental value.&nbsp; It is part of our heritage and culture.&nbsp;If you look at the Chinese word \"educate\", <I>jiao</I> comprises two parts.&nbsp; It is <I>xiao</I>&nbsp;and <I>wen</I>.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;education is the art of filial piety.&nbsp; So filial piety forms the crux of Asian education.&nbsp; I think that piece of Asian wisdom we should never forget.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo:</B> My question was, why not national coverage of MediShield, which the Minister did not answer?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> I have explained this before.&nbsp; If I were to design MediShield from day 1, 15 years ago, I would have done so.&nbsp; I would have preferred to make it compulsory.

Sir, I beg to move,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated for Head&nbsp;K of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our policy of offering greater variety and customisation according to the capability of the students is a correct approach.&nbsp; We ought to produce a few peaks of excellence while maintaining a high general level of academic achievements.&nbsp; However, I would like to stress that our education policy cannot be focused only on academic achievements.&nbsp; We must provide a holistic and balanced education for our children.&nbsp; In Chinese, there&nbsp;are five words that describe the five key aspects of education, <I>de zhi ti qun mei</I>, meaning moral values and character building, intelligence and knowledge, physical development, social skills and artistic skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have done very well in the academic aspects.&nbsp; But I feel that we should strengthen our moral education and character development programmes.&nbsp; Moral values are important as they provide a sense of responsibility, accountability and respect for others.&nbsp; This is the basis of any interpersonal relationship, without which we cannot build a strong community.&nbsp; Character development, on the other hand, is important as it gives the person strength and determination to overcome obstacles and realise his dreams in life.&nbsp; I would like to repeat my call to the Ministry to review the moral education and character development programmes in our schools, such as the co-curriculum activities, the community involvement programme and the National Education programme.&nbsp; Perhaps, it is time that we revamped these programmes to make them more relevant and more effective.&nbsp; We could use the tsunami incident to teach our children values and character.&nbsp; Perhaps, the older children may even be able to be involved<p align=left>Column: 2111<p> in part of the relief and rebuilding efforts.&nbsp; This would help reinforce what they learn in the classrooms.&nbsp; I think more can be done in this area.&nbsp; And it would be useful to form a taskforce to review our present programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in our strive for excellence, we must also be mindful not to neglect students that need additional help.&nbsp; This is in line with our philosophy of building a caring and inclusive community.&nbsp; There are three categories of students whom we need to pay more attention.&nbsp; Firstly, slower students.&nbsp; We need to help slower students make progress and achieve success.&nbsp; We need to give them encouragement and build their confidence.&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to urge the Ministry to consider doing away with the remaining EM3 streaming at the primary level.&nbsp; We can give schools more flexibility to decide how to differentiate among its students and provide learning support for them, without explicit streaming.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, disabled students.&nbsp; We must improve our facilities to allow greater integration of students with disabilities.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;run kindergartens which include autistic children, and it is tough.&nbsp; They need more time and more attention.&nbsp; These students will also need greater financial support as they would require additional therapy to help them cope with the normal education programme.&nbsp; The Government has provided additional funding for them, or perhaps more could be done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, delinquent students.&nbsp; We must provide counselling and support for students who have disciplinary problems.&nbsp; Our objectives must&nbsp;be to try to keep them in schools, rather than to keep them out,&nbsp;so long as they do not affect other students in the school.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to urge the Ministry to take a more lenient approach in re-admitting students who have dropped out of schools.&nbsp; The Minister has explained that these students must demonstrate a sincere desire to<p align=left>Column: 2112<p> return to school before they are re-admitted.&nbsp;

This, they say, is aggravated by the shift to the 5-day week.&nbsp; Schools are perceived to cram the 5 1/2 days' workload into five days.&nbsp; As a result, some parents of secondary school children told me that their children who used to leave school at 3.00 pm now do so at about 6.00 pm.&nbsp; Another told me that his son leaves&nbsp;his school even later, after 7.00 pm.&nbsp; Because of this development, the family now has even less time together.&nbsp; Parents perceive different causes for the problem.&nbsp; But they all have one plea to the Ministry and schools:&nbsp; please look into ways to give time back to the children and the family.&nbsp; Some parents are impatient with the pace of change.&nbsp; They felt that the time between the announcement of the change and the implementation is too long.&nbsp; A case in point is the change to the teaching of the Chinese language.&nbsp; The proposed changes will not take effect until 2008.&nbsp; They do not want their children to miss out on the changes.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</B> Sir, three major points.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Certainty in syllabi.&nbsp; While Singaporeans often complain that the school system is stressful, the question is often whether the stress is from the school or whether it is from outside the school, namely, the parents.&nbsp; My children tell me that their schoolmates from China find it more relaxed and less stressful when they study in Singapore as compared to their schools in China.&nbsp; The Ministry may take measures to reduce workload on children to reduce stress.&nbsp; It has initiatives, such as \"Teach Less, Learn More\".&nbsp; When there is an announcement on syllabi reduction, instead of being happy, parents get frantic.&nbsp; When you tell parents that examinations will not be based on the standard textbooks, they panic.&nbsp; Parents will tap into their intelligence network to find out the right tutor who had helped a friend's child get solid grades for the last year's PSLE.&nbsp; It is the element of uncertainty that drives parents bananas in their endeavour to over-compensate for that void created in the reduction in school work.&nbsp; What the Ministry and the schools must do is to communicate to the parents as to what is required and spell out clearly what is in the syllabi at the beginning of each year.&nbsp; Nothing causes more stress and drives up the level of <I>kiasu-ness</I> than uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Outcomes of education. &nbsp;As the education system evolves and we churn out more diploma and degree graduates, the Ministry will need to assess the quality of graduates that come into the workforce.&nbsp; Employers' feedback provide an excellent source of feedback.&nbsp; Only <p align=left>Column: 2115<p>then can we assess the outcomes of our education system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to take the case of medical technologists who graduate from Singapore Polytechnic.&nbsp; Compared to medical technologists from overseas, our graduates are armed with theoretical knowledge but have very little practical skills.&nbsp; More often than not, we have to get our foreign-trained technologists to give further practical training to our local technologists.&nbsp; The main reason is that when they are posted to the public hospitals for their practical attachment, the technologists there are too busy to teach them to allow them hands-on training.&nbsp; Examinations do not tell everything.&nbsp; Performance in the real world does.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Learning Malay. &nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;I remember that,&nbsp;as a primary school child, I had to attend Malay classes for the first four years.&nbsp; Most of us thought that it was a waste of time as it was a non-examination subject.&nbsp; However, in the course of&nbsp;work, the basic foundation I had in Malay became important.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I converse in Malay with many of my foreign patients, and it has made a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;With&nbsp;Malaysia&nbsp;and Indonesia as our neighbours, it will certainly be useful to foster better relations with our neighbours by being able to communicate with them in Malay.&nbsp; We need to allow an avenue for our school children to be exposed to basic conversational Malay.&nbsp; However, learning has to be made interesting.&nbsp; As one student put it, \"No one will pay attention to non-examination subjects.\"&nbsp; Therefore, the onus is on the Ministry to come up with better creative teaching tools.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, the education system has been going <p align=left>Column: 2116<p>through a strict diet regime.&nbsp; When it is deemed to be too full, it gets trimmed, as in the latest \"Study Less and Learn More\", and when it is deemed to be too lean, it gets loaded, as in the past when the curriculum was beefed up to ensure that our students stay all-rounded.&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures were so targeted to keep our education system in good shape.&nbsp; But, just like any dieting programme, the best results are obtained from a combination of a&nbsp;regular exercise regime and an accurate diet prescription.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to note that MOE is slowly evolving to that desirable state of outcomes.&nbsp; For this, we need to engage all stakeholders.&nbsp; To date, we have been engaging academic staff, parents and students in some of the policy matters.&nbsp; I say some only because it is only in recent times that the MOE has made the conscious effort of holding dialogue sessions to hear out the views of students on matters pertaining to their education or to the society in which they live in.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three issues to raise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first issue, I would like to comment on the CCA/CIP for JCs and the schools in general.&nbsp; Sir, I understand that the PEARLS&nbsp;system framework has been provoking the outcries of students for many years since its implementation in 2000.&nbsp; I note in several of the tea sessions that I conducted with the ITE, polytechnic, JC and university students in 2003 and 2004, under the Feedback Unit, students did not hesitate to share the downside of a system that served to inculcate and perpetuate a paper chase mentality, except that this time they literally chased points.&nbsp; This is a sad state of affairs, as we know that CCA/CIP should throw up desired attributes, such as leadership, passion, commitment and time involvement, which are less quantifiable than the descriptors of \"Participation\", \"Achievement\" and \"Representation\" under the PEARLS system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2117<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the emphasis on the points to be attained had driven students to the point that some students had learned to \"outbeat\"&nbsp;the system by taking advantage of the score descriptors.&nbsp; The score descriptors \"Representation\" and \"Achievement\" under the PEARLS system are not an accurate reflection of the bigger purpose of what the CCA/CIP should be inculcating in a character.&nbsp; For example, two students A and B could both be engaged in a school approved-initiated outside club activity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student A displayed top ratings in all attributes of leadership, commitment, passion, time and effort devoted to the activity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, under the PEARLS framework, he failed to fulfill the descriptor of \"Representation\", as points given under \"Representation\" are only for competitions.&nbsp; Moreover, more points are given to MOE-organised competitions.&nbsp; Being in an outside club activity, even if it was possible to organise competitions, the fact remains that the scoring will be at a lower rating because they are not MOE-organised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student B may be less involved in the outside activity, so that some time could be spent in the school activity, such as the chess club.&nbsp; He would have fulfilled the descriptors of \"Representation\" and \"Achievement\".&nbsp; All that student B needed to do was to attend a few chess games, then sign up for a competition.&nbsp; In this instance, student B would be allocated points for \"Representation\" and \"Achievement\" even if he did not win the competition, whereas student A who excelled in the outside activity would have gotten a zero for both \"Representation\" and \"Achievement\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many students have been affected negatively by the PEARLS framework, especially if their scores are at the border of an upper and lower grade, eg, between<p align=left>Column: 2118<p> an A and&nbsp;B because of failure to fulfill the \"Representation\" and \"Achievement\" descriptors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the recognition of CCA and CIP for scholarship awards, I would like to ask whether the PEARLS framework would be the only evaluation tool to be used.&nbsp; I would request that, as a supplement to verify the true involvement of a student in an activity, perhaps a testimonial written by the mentor or coach of the activity and verified by the school could be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on CIP assessment, I understand that under this scheme, students had also learnt to \"outbeat\"&nbsp;the system simply by going round to chalk up hours but not actually getting involved in a meaningful way.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to know what is MOE's proposed implementation process to ensure the continuous involvement and feedback of all stakeholders on matters that impact them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my second issue, I would like to raise about teachers in school.&nbsp; It has been reported that teachers have left the profession because they could not cope with the additional administrative demands imposed on them.&nbsp; How does MOE intend to go about helping these teachers to cope?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, I would like to touch on students with disabilities in learning.&nbsp; I would like to relate the experience of one particular Primary 2 student who has a learning disability.&nbsp; In the eyes of his project team mates, he had become responsible for slowing down the work of his class because of his slowness.&nbsp; This child undergoes the Learning Support programme in school.&nbsp; His classmates have creatively changed the label of Learning Support to \"Lousy and Stupid\" and he is called lousy and stupid by them.&nbsp; This has affected him much, such that he has developed eating disorders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am not against integrating children with disabilities in the main<p align=left>Column: 2119<p> school.&nbsp; But I would like to know what are MOE and the schools doing about situations like this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, in the year 2000, MOE launched the subject-based pilot classrooms plan.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry is ready to fully implement the plan with a view to ultimately replace the current streaming system.&nbsp; I think the true spirit of&nbsp; \"teaching according to students' ability\" is to respect individual students' natural endowment and strength and teach them the corresponding contents and methods.&nbsp; Give them the corresponding space and opportunities so as to lead students to realise their potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By euphemism, the current streaming system is described as&nbsp; \"teaching according to ability\".&nbsp; In reality, it favours the two subjects of English and Mathematics.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Mathematics examinations seem to test the students' proficiency in English to comprehend the questions that are set rather than their mathematical skills. This type of elimination system based on the command of English fails to fully assess and discover the students' natural endowment and aptitude.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a student should lose the chance to go on studying their strong subjects such as Chinese or Science just because their English is poor, can it be said that we are streaming them according to their ability? Worse, the superficial elimination system has left in the minds of many students the intangible branding or inferiority complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; School rankings have caused principals to avoid putting resources and attention on such students. This makes them feel rejected and hopeless, consequently giving up on themselves and&nbsp;become a <p align=left>Column: 2120<p>social problem aggravating&nbsp;juvenile delinquency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the polarisation of streaming results in elitist education and \"elite schools\".&nbsp; Many parents push&nbsp;their children to learn with intensive&nbsp;tuition hoping for their children's admission into these elite schools.&nbsp; This jeopardises the health of students and the meaning of the quest for knowledge is distorted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming system also results in serious social contradictions. There is this student from one of the \"elite&nbsp;schools\" who sparks a war of words with the neighbourhood school students over the issue of boy-girl relations. They use words full of class discrimination and set up the alarm bell of social segmentation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we sit on the fence and do nothing, then this will become a heavy price to pay later. Year in and year out, I have repeatedly asked for a&nbsp;review of the streaming system because its&nbsp;ill implication is&nbsp;far-reaching.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that the Education Minister will boldly deal with the present streaming system to fully meet the demand and concept of teaching according to the students' ability.&nbsp; To&nbsp;truly develop our talents, we must resolutely abolish this narrow and rigid streaming system and expand the concept of subject-based classrooms by implementing the subject-based teaching system that is customised based on students' ability and interest. This will provide greater opportunity to maximise the potential of students, allowing the full play of maximum ability of each student.&nbsp; This is in contrast to the current system of streaming in determining one's fate by English language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development of a society depends on development of each individual within that society.&nbsp; An education system which is flexible with a customised system of teaching to foster individual development is helpful in building a reservoir of human capital for our nation.&nbsp; This will enable us<p align=left>Column: 2121<p> better face the challenges of this rapidly changing world.&nbsp; The current streaming system lacks these positive factors.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Recognising Excellence and Helping the Academically Challenged</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, I have said in the Chamber before that I am glad that we are beginning to recognise excellence in education in all its possible forms and not only in academic performance.&nbsp; But I have a small concern which I would like to ask MOE.&nbsp; Once we have recognised our brightest, whatever field it may be, should we not&nbsp;continue to develop them even further?&nbsp; I would like to ask MOE what are the resources that&nbsp;are being allocated to further develop our young in whatever area apart from academic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also the need to develop the balanced individuals.&nbsp; Holistic education is what we want, as what Mr Gan has mentioned earlier.&nbsp; A child whose only strength is academic will exhibit inadequacies, some of them may be disruptive to family and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emotional development is extremely important, for instance, compassion for others, culture awareness and appreciation, especially in a multi-racial Singapore. This must be imbibed in our young during their early years. We do not want a lopsided emphasis on the academic aspect of education at the expense of other important areas like character building, soft skills, appreciation of the arts and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask MOE&nbsp;what are we doing to enlighten parents in this area.&nbsp; I know that it may not be MOE's view to seek to educate parents, but as partners in education, parents must be made to understand that their children must be educated in&nbsp;all aspects, not only&nbsp;on <p align=left>Column: 2122<p>academics.&nbsp;&nbsp;This overwhelming emphasis on academic education is something we have created in our desperation to develop as a nation, something we must unlearn and discard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point, Sir, is in relation to the academically challenged.&nbsp; Our teachers must be given proper resources and skills to identify the academically challenged children at their early age. Time may be of the essence in these cases. What more can be done to assist this group of children&nbsp;apart from the LSP programme that has been mentioned many times? I would like to know what MOE is doing and what kind of resources is being provided to assist our teachers and the system to assist the young who are academically challenged.&nbsp;Addressing this early will bear us fruits in the long term.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Mindset Change</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo</B>:&nbsp; Sir, there is a need for MOE to promote a mindset change in our people with regard to stressful education in Singapore. Stress of education is still being faced by students and parents despite the announcement of MOE for significant cuts in curricula, change of teaching and examination systems, modified ranking and admission procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There should be more effort put in to better inform parents and teachers about the recent initiatives of MOE.&nbsp; MOE should step up public education to enhance a positive approach and correct attitudes of parents and teachers alike.&nbsp; Should there not be more emphasis on preparing our young children to be the successful individuals of tomorrow who are innovative, confident, inspired, informed and globally savvy citizens?&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents must be convinced that there are the attributes that their children need for a leg-up in the job market and for success in their careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Innovative skills and creativity in our children, the attributes which we want to <p align=left>Column: 2123<p>cultivate, will not come from just getting good academic scores.&nbsp; Young children may lose the joy of learning, questioning, exploring if they are overloaded with school work and other extra-curricular activities with no free time of their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a need to promote a mindset change that every child will be given the opportunity to develop his or her best potential, albeit not limited to just the few popular professions. Success must be further defined without stereotyping of certain professions only.&nbsp; MOE must ensure that teachers observe the guideline changes that were announced.&nbsp; It would certainly defeat the purpose of cutting the syllabus of various subjects if the teachers still insist on teaching&nbsp;them.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Dr Neo, your time is up.&nbsp; Dr Loo Choon Yong.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Student Development</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, we have allocated $6.16 billion or 20.8% of total expenditure of Government to education.

Can the Minister share with us his plans and strategy and methodology for retraining the teachers and principals to the mindset that my colleague, Dr Lily Neo, talked about?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know it is a lot easier to teach content than to inspire and nurture students to new habits of mind.&nbsp; Contents are more tangible and measurable. So teachers, principals and inspectors will find it easier to account for their work.&nbsp; But we all know that the content rapidly becomes outdated in this fast changing world.&nbsp; Even medical knowledge has a half life of seven years only.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I urge all of us to be brave, the teachers especially, to be bold, as we embark on this new course.&nbsp; This is a bold fundamental shift&nbsp;of direction for our education system.&nbsp; Or in sailing language, it is a tack and not just trimming the sails.&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, if at the end of the 10 years' education, we have instilled in our youths the curiosity and passion for learning and impart to them the arts and skill of learning, we would have succeeded and all the money would have been worth it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, recently, I re-read PM's Address at the National Day Rally last year -&nbsp;23 insightful and inspiring paragraphs, the result of his conversations with 10 school principals and, of course, his own <p align=left>Column: 2125<p>experience.&nbsp; I recommend that the Minister make these 23 paragraphs compulsory reading for every teacher and principal if he has not done so.&nbsp; It will inspire teachers and principals to be bold and creative and be agents of change and not obstacles to change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am optimistic.&nbsp; Last Sunday, I am sure we have all read about the \"<I>zi cha</I>\" man - a hawker who sells seafood <I>guotiao</I> or whips up a 10-course dinner, shark's fin, suckling pig,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; This is a hawker who has a dream to sail around the world. He is forking out $8,000 to sail from the Caribbean to Liverpool.&nbsp; To prepare for this sail, he has to learn about navigational rules in the Atlantic, sail routes, currents, coastal, coordinates, hazards and so on.&nbsp; He continues to nurture his passion - to learn and grow.&nbsp; He is a hawker. This is the kind of people we hope our schools will produce.&nbsp; We will then have a learning nation and we will excel.&nbsp; Workers will no longer need REAP and other retraining programmes because if workers are constantly improving themselves, they will actually be ahead of the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, parents.&nbsp; Most parents are interested in the education of their children. Would the Minister be considering new and novel ways to tap this large resource of adjunct teachers free of charge?&nbsp; Parents want their children to do well and get ahead.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many of them are responsible for killing their children's interest in learning when they force-feed them with assessment books, home tuition and, in recent times, enrichment classes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, can the MOE not work out ways for parents to participate more constructively in the education of their children and have a stronger parent-teacher partnership in&nbsp;experiential <p align=left>Column: 2126<p>learning?&nbsp; For a start, may I suggest MOE prepare materials to guide parents so that they can bring their children on outings where they can bond as a family, as well as learn things together?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunities abound in Singapore - visit the Arts Museum for art appreciation, tree-top walk to learn more about nature, flora and fauna and protect the environment, visit Sungei Buloh to learn about mangrove swamps and the life forms there, visit the Wax Museum to learn about Singapore's history, and Chinatown and Little India to learn about our heritage.&nbsp; The materials should contain information, learning opportunities, learning points, highlights and thoughtful questions, not the assessment book type of questions, one question only one answer.&nbsp; This will equip the parents for the task so that they would not find it too daunting.&nbsp; If we do this well, we will kill three birds with one stone.&nbsp; The children's curiosity gets aroused or stimulated.&nbsp; They will feel loved,&nbsp;parents will feel purposeful in educating their children and the joy of doing that is a great experience.&nbsp; And maybe even the&nbsp;fourth bird, some parents may actually be rekindled to want to learn again.&nbsp; We can also extend this to the area of community service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is often said that life is a marathon.&nbsp; So the success or failure in junior college examinations&nbsp;is only a very small part in the life-long journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The important point is that it must not be able to destroy the confidence of a student.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to the said newspaper report, SM Goh said that, \"What the junior college students experience is nothing.&nbsp; Wait till they go out into the globalised world.&nbsp; They shall meet challenges which are many times stiffer&nbsp;than what they experienced from the foreign students in schools.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever it is, our students must be brought up to have confidence in themselves.&nbsp; If they have that kind of positive attitude they shall have better chances of succeeding in life.&nbsp; Maybe a good example is what Dr Loo has said, the z<I>i cha</I> man, he has got so much confidence he is willing to sail alone around the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Minister could arrange for regular talks by successful Singaporeans in schools to inculcate confidence in the students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is on the enrolment of foreign students in our newly opened music conservatory.&nbsp; Singapore has only one conservatory and has proven to be very popular.&nbsp; The enrolment to the conservatory is high and competition for places is keen.&nbsp; I know Singapore observes <p align=left>Column: 2128<p>meritocracy.&nbsp; In the case of admissions to the conservatory, I am certain that only those who qualify could get admitted, yet, I read in the newspapers that parents are complaining that too many foreign students are enrolled in the conservatory and their own children, who are Singaporeans, have missed out.&nbsp; Has the admission procedure not been made clear to those parents?&nbsp; Could the Minister explain whether there is a policy to gain foreign talents in our conservatory at the expense of local students?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, with the recent changes in the education system, I would like MOE to give more emphasis to character building of our students to develop values in them that will enrich their lives as individuals, and as members of society.&nbsp; Desirable basic character traits, such as courtesy, honesty, responsibility, fairness, filial piety, consideration for others and obedience to legitimate rules, in other words, knowing the good, desiring the good and doing the good, should be fostered.&nbsp; May I ask MOE what steps are being taken to ensure the character building of our students?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that such values be reinforced without being indoctrinated and made interesting through interactive modes instead of being a study subject.&nbsp; Could MOE ensure that such character building education yield effects that students could relate to and apply to themselves?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The character traits should permeate the students' environment.&nbsp;

During my visits to my constituency, I notice that younger people are now more willing to be involved in community activities.&nbsp; Now that it has been seven years since we implemented this scheme, what has been the progress?&nbsp;

Sir, our students in school are at an age where they are most receptive to learning.&nbsp; Our educators have made excellent progress in imparting a wealth of academic knowledge to them in their formative years.&nbsp; Recent changes in the education system envision that our students will become thinking adults.&nbsp; I applaud this approach and look forward to seeing more thinkers than rote learners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we are in the midst of effecting these changes in how our young are taught, I ask that their personal development too be considered.&nbsp; Our <p align=left>Column: 2130<p>multi-cultural, racial and religious heritage demands that we develop a more mature society through imparting knowledge about how we live in harmony.&nbsp; Religious knowledge, imparted in a way that is not politicised, will be an effective tool because it teaches our youth to recognise and respect the beliefs of their fellow citizens.&nbsp; I understand that currently, in higher primary schools, the students are taught a little bit about the festivities celebrated by&nbsp;other races, while the secondary school students learn some very basic information on religions.&nbsp; I find that inadequate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the Ministry will consider the introduction of teaching more about the different religions and starting them in early primary school years.&nbsp; We should not just touch on religions superficially.&nbsp; We should gradually build up the students' understanding of all the major religions in Singapore.&nbsp; We must aim that, at the end of the lower secondary schools, our students understand the fundamental principles and values of each religion, such as the five pillars of Islam, the four noble truths of Buddhism, and so on.&nbsp; We should let students know the significance of one another's religious practices.&nbsp; In addition, we should also arrange for our students to visit places of worship of the different religions.&nbsp; In so doing, we could nurture cultural and religious sensitivities of our students and build a more gracious and even more harmonious society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Chairman, every year, we hear repeated calls to make the system less stressful, less competitive, allowing our children to enjoy school, etc.&nbsp; I used to hear them but was not able to fully appreciate the extent of these calls until my children started going to school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stress level is high, not only in classrooms but also outside the<p align=left>Column: 2131<p> classrooms, not to mention in our own homes,&nbsp;especially outside the classrooms during CCAs.&nbsp; Sir, my concern is&nbsp;how these CCAs are conducted, the spirit behind it and the implications on the children.&nbsp; Specifically, I would&nbsp; like to focus on CCAs for sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was in school, I remember that the policy then was to have every student to be members of one uniformed group, one sports and another from another category.&nbsp; This ensured that students had a well-rounded exposure to the different categories of CCAs, or ECAs then, which offered diverse and unique experiences.&nbsp; Sir, this does not seem to be the case today.&nbsp; In fact, in the spirit of decentralisation of MOE, my fear now is that every school has its own way of managing their CCAs.&nbsp; Sir, while I appreciate the value of providing school autonomy, I urge the Ministry to keep a close tab on what is happening on the ground and its impact on the children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that in some schools the focus on sports CCA is primarily competitive sports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in the old times, we joined a&nbsp;particular sport as a CCA because we enjoyed the game.&nbsp; Today, at least in some schools, students can only join the CCA for a particular sport, only if they are competitively good at.&nbsp; They have to undergo a trial or an audition, and only those who are good at, and who will be able to represent their school competitively, will be selected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, within such a system, obviously there will be a sizable number of children who will end up not being selected as the school will only take in the numbers that are necessary to focus their resources that will bring glory to the school.&nbsp; The end result is that you have students, eager initially, to be part of the sports fraternity, being rejected from one sporting group to another.&nbsp; Rejection is an understatement.&nbsp; I know it personally because I have seen it in my daughter and<p align=left>Column: 2132<p> several of her friends.&nbsp; I know I am not the only parent who is saying that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to ensure that the&nbsp;Ministry has a consistent policy with regard to CCA for sports in school so that we do not have a situation where sports is seen only in the competitive sense but&nbsp;rather that one can actually enjoy the sport.&nbsp; This is very much in line with our approach of encouraging sports for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B> Sir, first let me thank the Members who have spoken so far for their constructive comments and the broad support that they have expressed for the directions that we are pursuing in education.&nbsp; I should also thank them for the passion that never escapes&nbsp;a debate on education in this House, a passion that is really not surprising because, as Mr Gan Kim Yong has said, children are&nbsp;our key asset in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; So, if we prepare them well, if we help them each to discover their own strengths and talents, and nurture in them the qualities they&nbsp;need to do well in life and to play a responsible role in the community, we will be preparing Singapore well for the future.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan, together with Dr Tan Boon Wan, Dr Lily Neo, Dr Ong Seh Hong, Mdm Ho Geok Choo, Mr Zainudin Nordin and Dr Loo Choon Yong,&nbsp;had a common theme in their comments.&nbsp; They all spoke about the need to develop our students holistically.&nbsp; I agree with them that education is much more than about grades.&nbsp; The knowledge that our students acquire in school, and are tested on, is important.&nbsp; It is often the building block for future knowledge and learning.&nbsp; But more important is to nurture an enquiring spirit, a certain zest for learning that carries them through life.&nbsp; And just as important, we want our children to be imbued with sound moral and social values - especially the compassion and respect for others that<p align=left>Column: 2133<p> make for a cohesive society - and to develop the strength of character that allows them to ride over difficulties and live life to the fullest.&nbsp; Values and character development have always been integral to the education our schools provide and are now more relevant than ever.&nbsp; So I fully agree with Members who have spoken about the need to keep in focus these broader dimensions in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been several changes in our education system in recent years.&nbsp; There are not too many and they are not taking place too soon.&nbsp; If we do not keep evolving, as Mr Gan Kim Yong put it, our children will grow up unprepared for the world&nbsp;- a fast changing world.&nbsp; In the leading Chinese cities, major changes are taking place in curriculum every year, even in the learning of the Chinese language and in the way the schools and universities are being freed up to pursue new paths. They are&nbsp;looking outwards, taking ideas from around the world and implementing them quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, there is great dissatisfaction with the state of schools, and the desire to move ahead with&nbsp;reforms. But their problems are complex, the ideological currents often run deeper and their teachers are often organised to oppose reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So our ability to move ahead with educational reforms in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is a major advantage&nbsp;- our ability to revise the curriculum, to keep it relevant, to train our teachers, recruit new ones and to let some schools run ahead with the new models of education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent changes in our schools are summarised in the blue booklet that Members might have picked up before the debate.&nbsp; But the thrust of the changes and refinements we are making in education<p align=left>Column: 2134<p> can be summarised in two words - opportunity and flexibility. Across the system, we are opening up more choices, more doors and paths to help our young discover their talents and develop them as far as we can.&nbsp; That is the essence of what we are doing, and we will keep communicating this to parents and students so that they understand the options being put before them and which are&nbsp;open to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our schools now provide far more diverse opportunities than they did five years ago.&nbsp; It is most clearly evident amongst our secondary schools and junior colleges, but now our primary schools are also developing distinct strengths in diverse areas, from sports and arts, to outdoor adventure, and in the way we are bringing IT into teaching and learning.&nbsp; This is a new phase of diversity that we have embarked on.&nbsp; It is diversity that will be built on a common commitment to a high quality core curriculum that every primary school will deliver to prepare every child well for secondary education.&nbsp; We have just awarded 16 primary schools additional resources, up to $100,000 a year, to develop their own special strengths under the Programme for School-based Excellence.&nbsp; We will scale the number&nbsp;up in the coming years as more good proposals come through for schools wanting to develop niche programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also recognising more diverse strengths amongst students, beside their performance in national examinations.&nbsp; This is an important step in education.&nbsp; Last year, we introduced the discretionary school admission system for our integrated programme schools which were given the flexibility to take in students on their own merit-based criteria.&nbsp; This year, we will be extending the discretionary scheme to our independent schools, our autonomous schools, other schools with well-established niches and our junior colleges for between 5-20% of their total<p align=left>Column: 2135<p> intake of students.&nbsp; This will take place at the end of this year for admission 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother tongue language learning is also being reformed to help students develop an abiding interest in the language.&nbsp; We have been making refinements to our system of ability-based education by introducing more flexibility within the streaming system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><st1:time Hour=\"14\" Minute=\"45\">2.45 pm</st1:time></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We want to give them a broad range of experiences as they grow up which provides them with the opportunities to develop character, to learn critical life skills and imbibe values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide this, we have to do less of some things in education.&nbsp; The system is already full to the brim.&nbsp; So if we want to provide more space for character education, sports participation,&nbsp;independent learning or research,&nbsp;we have to reduce some other things that we do in education.&nbsp; Otherwise, we are overloading our schools and teachers, and run the risk of turning off our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We, therefore, have to make careful choices on what to take out as much as<p align=left>Column: 2136<p> what to put in.&nbsp; And as we do so, we have to avoid eroding the core strengths that have got us here.&nbsp; We have to achieve a new balance in education that provides&nbsp;broad-based holistic education for our students without compromising the rigour of learning in school that prepares our students well for post-secondary education wherever they go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our basic approach, as we go forward, is to go for more quality and less quantity.&nbsp; We will focus on the quality of learning, quality of CCA and community engagements and the quality of the whole school experience that the student goes through.&nbsp; We will seek to cut back on quantity, careful and calculated cuts, so as to provide more \"white space\" in the curriculum, space which gives schools and teachers the room to introduce their own programmes, to inject more quality into teaching, to reflect more, to have more time for preparing lessons and to give students themselves the room to exercise initiative and to shape their own learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are reviewing this thoroughly in MOE and in our schools.&nbsp; We are working towards a 10-20% cut in our secondary school syllabuses in 2007-2008, similar to what we will do in the new JC curriculum from next year.&nbsp; We will do this judiciously.&nbsp; I absolutely agree with Dr Tan Boon Wan that any cuts should not undermine the core knowledge and skills that our young should have, or lead to an erosion of&nbsp;an ethic of hard work.&nbsp; And I should clarify that our objective is not to reduce stress per se.&nbsp; Our objective is to redistribute the load that students currently occupy themselves with, from an excessive focus on the academic and on examinations towards a broader focus consistent with our&nbsp;holistic aims in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our schools are moving ahead with their own initiatives.&nbsp; Victoria Junior College decided this year to shorten<p align=left>Column: 2137<p> teaching periods and end school an hour earlier&nbsp;each day, to signal students the importance of engaging in their own learning.&nbsp;They also created on-line discussion forums instead of&nbsp;regular General Paper lessons to encourage students to express their views freely.&nbsp; They now find that, on their own, students participate more actively in the on-line discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools are also reassessing the number of tests and examinations that they conduct.&nbsp; Tests and examinations have an important role to play in giving both teachers and students a sense of how they are progressing, and in motivating our students to go over what they have been taught to make sure they have understood it.&nbsp; But an excessive focus on examinations tends to narrow teaching and learning. It discourages students from venturing beyond what might be tested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many schools have gone ahead to experiment with different approaches to assess how pupils are progressing, particularly in the primary school years.&nbsp; Ms Eunice Olsen had asked during the Budget debate whether MOE would consider removing examinations for Primary 1 and 2.&nbsp; These are decisions which the schools will have to make.&nbsp; This year, two-thirds of our primary schools have decided to remove at least one of the two continuous assessment&nbsp;(CA) tests that they had conducted for Primary 1 students.&nbsp; Many have done likewise at the upper levels.&nbsp; Most schools have retained their mid-year and year-end semestral examinations in order to get timely feedback on student performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree fully with Mr Gan Kim Yong and Dr Lily Neo that we have to keep up communication with our stakeholders, especially our parents, as we proceed with changes in education.&nbsp; We will keep<p align=left>Column: 2138<p> doing this, first and foremost, through our schools themselves.&nbsp; We will also continue to use the media and MOE information booklets like the one we have just distributed.&nbsp; We want parents to know where we are heading, and how they can help their children and guide them in making choices in education.&nbsp; Parents should not equate large amounts of homework and frequent tests with effective learning.&nbsp; We should also not have unrealistic expectations of our children's abilities and push them so hard that they lose all joy in learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are encouraging signs.&nbsp; A growing number of parents are looking at success in education more broadly than by examination performance alone, just as schools are recognising more diverse measures of success. Parents&nbsp;are helping their children find their own strengths and selecting schools that can best develop those strengths.&nbsp; We will keep up our communication with parents so that they support the schools' efforts to give children a holistic education and provide room for them to pursue the things they have a talent in or&nbsp;enjoy doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Michael Lim asked specifically whether schools will keep parents informed of changes in the school syllabus before the start of the year.&nbsp; Our syllabi are posted on the websites of MOE and the Singapore Examinations Assessment Board.&nbsp; Syllabuses of the various examination subjects are also updated on the Internet for the public to access at the start of the year.&nbsp; And schools also keep parents and pupils informed on the parts of the syllabus to be assessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now turn to issues raised by Members concerning character development. Let me first address the specific point raised by Mr Gan Kim Yong on students who drop out, before I move on to the broader issues that he and others raised on character building. Mr Gan wanted the Ministry to be more lenient in<p align=left>Column: 2139<p> re-admitting students who had dropped out. Fortunately, our drop-out rates are low. And the majority of those who left school because they were expelled or for other reasons, and who want to return to school, are able to do so. But I am not keen to change our stance, that students should only be re-admitted if they show a genuine desire to learn and abide by school rules. It is not a \u201cpunitive approach\ufffd? as Mr Gan puts it, but one that preserves a culture of discipline in our schools. If we were to let students move in and out of school at will, we would demoralise the majority who remain. We will also lose the happy situation we have where the vast majority of students are keen to remain in school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should do all we can to keep this culture of discipline and avoid the drop-out and delinquency problems we see in many other countries. In the UK, the government has spent more than S$2.7 billion since 1997 on schemes to tackle truancy in schools with virtually no success. They now intend to spend an additional $1.7 billion in the coming two years to try to entice 50,000 students who skip classes every day back to school.&nbsp; About 40% of schools in the UK reported pupils bringing weapons into the playground or classroom at least once a term - previously thought to be an American problem, it is now&nbsp;British.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US, a recent Harvard University study found that 32% of American youths do not complete high school. In Japan, there has been a rising tide of serious crimes among students -&nbsp;crimes including pre-meditated homicide. Violence in school grounds is reported to have increased five-fold over the last decade. There is a sense of crisis in the Japanese society as a growing number of students seem to behave in ways that are completely alien to their parents, let alone their grandparents.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are fortunate that our social fabric is still intact and strong. The number of<p align=left>Column: 2140<p> serious disciplinary cases in schools has not risen in recent years. We should keep the culture of respect for school rules and respect for fellow students.&nbsp; But we will do more&nbsp;- to help students at risk of dropping out or of falling into delinquency, and to help students who are keen to resume their studies and observe school rules after they have dropped out and&nbsp;want to come back.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By next year, we will have provided every secondary school with a full-time counsellor.&nbsp; By 2008, all primary schools and Junior Colleges&nbsp;will also have a full-time counsellor. This is in addition to the two teacher-counsellors we have already trained in our schools, and the&nbsp;two more we will train in secondary schools. They will help schools identify and assist students who need help.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to the broader agenda of character development in our schools. It is an agenda we are giving more importance to. But while the Ministry provides various platforms and resources for character development, such as through the Civics and Moral Education Programme (CME), pastoral care programmes, co-curricula activities (CCA)&nbsp; and Community Involvement Programmes (CIP), we cannot be too prescriptive about the specific activities we expect to see in schools. There is no single fix, no formula in education to impart sound values or to develop strength of character. Schools have to see what works for their own students&nbsp;- students with different backgrounds and needs&nbsp;- draw on their own school traditions, and develop their own programmes and practices over time. And it will take time.&nbsp;As the Chinese saying goes, it takes&nbsp;a hundred years to raise a man of character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we will encourage schools to explore their own ways to develop the character of their students&nbsp;-&nbsp;ways that have to work in their own context. We<p align=left>Column: 2141<p> will recognise schools that work consistently and effectively at&nbsp;character development&nbsp;through the new Character Development Award that we will be introducing in year 2006. These schools can then share their best practices, particularly their processes,&nbsp;with other schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But schools will have to rely on the support of parents and the community, without which the job is always incomplete. It is the total experience of the child -&nbsp;how he is raised at home, the experiences and relationships he&nbsp;develops in&nbsp;school, right through his years of schooling, his encounters in the community, what he sees in the media -&nbsp;as he grows up&nbsp;that shapes his character, quietly,&nbsp;in unseen ways, in the classroom, in the playing field, on the performing stage and in the cinema theatre. Schools cannot do it alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Dr Lily Neo that character education can be more authentic where we engage our students in interesting and meaningful activities. It cannot be a textbook subject. One way is to expose the students to real-life stories -&nbsp;stories of men and women who have shown strength of character in difficult times and who have made significant contributions to society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what Yangzheng Primary School did recently. It got 50 students to interview 20 prominent ex-students about their life experiences, and especially on how their personal values helped to make them what they are today. Some of the students were so inspired by the project that they hope to publish a book about these real-life stories. The stories brought to life for them useful lessons on hard work, thrift, honesty, uprightness and community spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2142<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCA and CIP programmes are integral to character education in all our schools.&nbsp; Mr Ong Ah Heng asked about the effectiveness of the CIP.&nbsp; It is now in its seventh year. On the whole, the CIP has been a very positive experience. The results of our annual CIP surveys and direct feedback from students in dialogue and feedback sessions&nbsp;indicate that CIP has made an impact in developing a spirit of volunteerism in our students during their school years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tsunami relief effort that Mr Ong also asked about was a good expression of this. Because you can&nbsp;really tell what is working when you see it happening, and not in what they tell you.&nbsp;Our schools raised a total of $3.5 million for aid agencies helping in the relief efforts.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>The&nbsp;students did not just stand with tins in street corners.&nbsp; They organised bazaars and charity fairs, washed cars, painted faces, and all kinds of other things.&nbsp; They were also active in mobilising other schools.&nbsp;Pioneer JC, for example, led other schools in its cluster to collect tents, clothings and blankets for Sri Lanka.&nbsp; And tomorrow,&nbsp;&nbsp;10th March, National Junior College will send some of its students to the Maldives, as part of its Overseas CIP to help rebuild some of the IT infrastructure that previous NJC students had in fact helped to build and&nbsp;which was destroyed&nbsp;by the tsunami.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are making changes that&nbsp;will give JC and CI students greater ownership over their CCA and CIP programmes.&nbsp; I agree with what Mr Gan&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo have said about the need to adopt a more qualitative approach.&nbsp; Student's CCA performance in JC is currently scored under a points system called PEARLS, as some Members know, for the purpose of applying to NUS and NTU.&nbsp; The CCA points are included in the applicant's University Admission Score with a weight of 5%, the remaining 95% being computed from their&nbsp;\"A\" level grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2143<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since last year, we have also allowed NUS and NTU to select students on their own independent criteria, under a new, discretionary admission scheme.&nbsp; It allows the universities to consider students on the basis of a broader range of intellectual and character attributes, besides their \"A\" level scores.&nbsp; NUS and NTU are currently allowed to admit up to 10% of their students under this discretionary scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universities are now ready to take a further step that will&nbsp;allow for a more holistic and meaningful assessment of students' qualities.&nbsp; A student's CCA, which is currently given a single numerical score, will instead be assessed qualitatively under the universities' discretionary admission scheme.&nbsp; This change will take place in year 2007 which is when the current cohort of first year JC students applies for university.&nbsp;NUS and NTU will look at the student's involvement and achievements in CCA and CIP for evidence of desired attributes, like leadership, creative flair, perseverance and the pursuit of excellence.&nbsp; This would be similar to the qualitative assessment of CCA that SMU has had from the outset.&nbsp; It is also similar to the way in which many reputable overseas universities consider applicants, ie,&nbsp;a holistic qualitative assessment, besides their academic scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE agrees with the universities' decision.&nbsp; With NUS and NTU's move to a more flexible and qualitative approach for considering CCA, there will no longer be a need for a fixed system or points for CCA in the JCs and the Centralised Institute. Starting from this year's JC1 students, we will no longer score the CCA achievements and involvements of junior college students.&nbsp; The junior colleges will also move towards a more qualitative record&nbsp;of students' involvement in CCA and CIP, by reflecting their involvement and any special achievements and contributions in the School Graduation Certificate.&nbsp; In line with these changes,&nbsp;the <p align=left>Column: 2144<p>Public Service Commission (PSC) will continue to look at scholarship applicants' achievements and participation in CCA and CIP within the new qualitative framework that JCs will implement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also remove the present six-hour minimum requirement for CIP in the junior colleges from this year.&nbsp; The CIP scheme, introduced in 1998, as I mentioned,&nbsp;is now a vibrant feature of junior college life.&nbsp; MOE is therefore comfortable with giving the junior colleges full autonomy to integrate CIP into their schools' curriculum in&nbsp;a way that best meets the needs and interests of their students.&nbsp; CIP will however remain an integral component of the junior college curriculum.&nbsp; The shift from a minimum time requirement for CIP is expected to help students to focus on authentic and enriching involvements, as many already do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes in CCA and CIP are consistent with feedback,&nbsp;extensive feedback, from students and the junior colleges over the last year.&nbsp; They&nbsp;would encourage students to take greater ownership over these activities, follow their passions and build camaraderie, rather than engage for the sake of getting points for university admission.&nbsp; The moves are also timely as they come before the new \"A\" level curriculum that will be introduced in 2006, which aims to give students greater room and more \"white space\" to pursue their passions and interests.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for secondary and primary students, we will continue to keep the requirement for six hours of CIP.&nbsp; For secondary students, we will also continue to have a grading system for their CCA which counts for entry to junior colleges and polytechnics.&nbsp; They are still young and will benefit from some structure and guidance to ensure that they get&nbsp;a holistic education, and to help them get the most<p align=left>Column: 2145<p> out of their school years through CCA and involvement in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Maliki asked about sports in schools.&nbsp; Our aim is to promote sporting excellence among students through training programmes and inter-school competitions, as well as sports&nbsp;for recreation for as many students as possible.&nbsp; Schools plan their own sports programmes, depending on the available manpower and physical infrastructure and the school's tradition.&nbsp; A school would typically offer some sports at a competitive level and others at the recreational level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we aim to provide every student the opportunity to take a sport that he or she desires, the reality that we are faced with is that we do have resource constraints, both in terms of infrastructure and trained teachers and coaches.&nbsp;But I would like to reassure Dr Maliki that I am equally concerned about this, and that we are studying ways to overcome these constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making progress.&nbsp; The number of students participating in sports, outdoor activities and other physical fitness activities increased by 9% last year.&nbsp; This year, more than 80% of Secondary 1 students were also assigned the CCA&nbsp;they most wanted to do, in other words, their first choice CCA.&nbsp; That is a significant improvement.&nbsp; I will give you an example, Loyang Secondary School.&nbsp; This year, Loyang Secondary was able to give all Secondary 1 students their first choice of CCA.&nbsp; The school also has a sports programme that aims to involve all students who do not do a sport as a full CCA with some exposure to sporting activities.&nbsp; Even its operational manager has got into action and started a weekly Floorball session. And from term 2, the school hopes to introduce two other sports, Pushball and&nbsp;American football,&nbsp;for mass participation.&nbsp;I am sure Members<p align=left>Column: 2146<p> know the differences between each of these games&nbsp;-&nbsp;Floorball, Pushball, American football!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our schools are also pooling their resources&nbsp;to enable students to take part in&nbsp;mass sports events.&nbsp; For example, the North Zone Primary School Sports Council has set aside funds that schools can use to organise fun activities for pupils not representing their school in sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the zonal level, we are organising many activities and competitions for students who do not take a sport CCA.&nbsp;In fact, last year, we had 12,000 primary school students and 700 secondary school students benefiting from these zonal activities organised by the Sports Development Committees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another theme that has emerged in today's debate is the issue of how we should meet the learning needs of different ability groups in our schools.&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong suggested that we remove the EM3 stream in primary schools.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked if we could not adopt a modular system, instead of streaming, in our schools.&nbsp; Mr Low's suggestion accepts that we need differentiation&nbsp;in the&nbsp;system to cater to students with different strengths.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Let me first say that streaming in schools is not an article of faith in MOE.&nbsp; It is a practical approach aimed at&nbsp;helping every student to develop&nbsp;himself to the best of his abilities.&nbsp; It is an approach that we keep refining. And it has worked well.&nbsp; By differentiating the curriculum for students of different abilities, it has allowed us to motivate all our students to sustain an interest in learning, work hard to achieve realistic learning targets and get recognised, get some form of merit, for their achievements.&nbsp; It has helped us avoid the large drop-out rates that you see in many other countries or the fact that large numbers of students are graduating from high schools without<p align=left>Column: 2147<p> basic competence in literacy and numeracy.&nbsp; We have avoided the pretence of inclusiveness in undifferentiated school systems.&nbsp; We have focused instead on getting real outcomes and real learning among&nbsp;all our students.&nbsp; It is not done perfectly and we can do better.&nbsp; But the vast majority of students in Singapore leave school with a real foundation of skills, ready for post-secondary education and to pick up further skills that they need in the workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also happens to be the way the rest of the world is moving.&nbsp; I give you the example of Korea, because it is a driven society, Asian society,&nbsp;Confucianist majority, not very unlike us.&nbsp; Korea has historically not differentiated its students much by ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had minor&nbsp;variations but, by and large, they had an egalitarian approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote what a recent editorial in a leading daily said in January this year, \"It is already a proven fact that the standardisation policy of 30 years has failed at nurturing exceptionally bright minds.&nbsp; It is now clear that the policy is also not effective in increasing scholastic abilities on the whole.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the Koreans doing?&nbsp; They are now setting aside 1% of pupils in elite classes, something like our gifted stream, and they are setting aside 5%&nbsp;of pupils&nbsp;who will take more advanced classes so that they can graduate faster than the others.&nbsp; And they are going to differentiate pupils in 50% of their schools by ability; they are moving towards streaming.&nbsp; I&nbsp;cite them because they are, as I mentioned,&nbsp;a driven and&nbsp;competitive society. &nbsp;It would be much easier for me to cite examples of societies which are not&nbsp;particularly competitive or&nbsp;efficient. The Koreans&nbsp;have found out after 30 years&nbsp;that it does not work, and that they need to do better. Because they&nbsp;like us&nbsp;face the same competition, from China.&nbsp; And in China, the top schools, the elite schools, the elite streams are moving faster than us.&nbsp; And the Chinese have absolutely no<p align=left>Column: 2148<p> compunction about putting the best resources - better facilities, better gymnasiums, heated swimming pools, the best teachers from universities coming down&nbsp;for their brightest students.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because they want their brightest to help China leapfrog the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are up against that.&nbsp; Korea is up against that.&nbsp; We are lucky we did not make the same mistakes they did in the last 30 years.&nbsp; We have got a system that is imperfect but working fairly well, constant refinement, constant need to make it more flexible, but we are&nbsp;on the right track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan has suggested doing away with EM3 and letting all students take the same PSLE examinations.&nbsp; To put matters in perspective, let me provide a few facts.&nbsp; Our EM3 pupils comprise just 7-8% of each age cohort.&nbsp; Students who fail every subject are given the option of taking the EM3 curriculum when they get to Primary 5.&nbsp; It is an option given to parents. And parents who accept this option do so because they know their child will benefit from a pruned down curriculum, that they can master at their own pace.&nbsp; To illustrate, the EM3 Mathematics curriculum is pitched at about 60% of the content of the regular PSLE Mathematics curriculum.&nbsp;Further, EM3 students spend 30% more curriculum time on Mathematics as other students do on&nbsp;Mathematics. They get good teachers. In fact,&nbsp;some of the most&nbsp;committed teachers&nbsp;I meet on my school visits are often the EM3 teachers. So it is not true,&nbsp;as Mr Low says, that schools have neglected the EM3 group&nbsp;as there are&nbsp;fewer resources for them.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;simply not true on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether, it is an arrangement that helps the majority of them pass their EM3 Mathematics examinations. However, some 20% of EM3 Mathematics students still fail to get a grade&nbsp;in the EM3&nbsp;final&nbsp;Mathematics examinations; in other <p align=left>Column: 2149<p>words, they get what we call Ungraded, in their final assessment.&nbsp;Would EM3 students do better if they had stayed with the regular curriculum, and taken it at the same pace as other students?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our differentiated curriculum through streaming was, in fact, one of the strengths highlighted in a recent study by the American Institutes of Research funded by the US Department of Education, that is, their Ministry of Education,&nbsp;entitled \u201cWhat the United States can Learn from Singapore's World-Class Mathematics System\ufffd?. In contrast to the Singapore system of ability-based learning, the authors noted that in the US, \u201cwe expect all students to meet the standards in state frameworks, but the standards do not help teachers address the needs of slower students. In fact, US standards do not acknowledge that students learn at different rates\ufffd?.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason to give up the EM3 stream. It keeps our weakest pupils keen on attending school, gives them a foundation of knowledge that they can master or pass, and prepares them for secondary school.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some EM3 students when taught at a slower pace in Primary 5 and 6, in fact, catch up and do well enough to go to the Normal (Academic) stream.&nbsp; Some make it to polytechnic</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>and a handful even make it to JC.&nbsp; That does not mean that it was a mistake to have streamed them.&nbsp; It is often because they were given the opportunity to step back, start from basics again, get their foundations in place, gain confidence because they pass an examination instead of failing repeatedly, and then go on to their secondary school years with more enthusiasm for learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing, however, is to introduce greater flexibility into the <p align=left>Column: 2150<p>streaming system wherever practical.&nbsp; Streaming need not be absolute, where a student takes every subject within his own stream. Some students will have strengths in specific subjects, which may allow them to study those subjects at a higher level or at a faster pace.&nbsp; We are letting them do so, both at the primary and secondary level. &nbsp;We have, in effect, been allowing for increased modularity and flexibility within the streaming system.&nbsp;We are doing it in steps, and learning as we go along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In primary school, we now allow EM3 students who are strong in their mother tongue language to take the subject at a higher level.&nbsp; Some are already doing so.&nbsp; But Mr Low mentioned that there is a bias in the assessment system towards English and Mathematics instead of the mother tongue.&nbsp; I have an interesting bit of feedback to relate to him which I get from schools quite often.&nbsp; There are, in fact, some EM3 students who can take advantage of the scheme we have opened up for them to study the mother tongue at a higher level.&nbsp;&nbsp;But their parents choose for them not to do it.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because their parents want them to spend more time on English and Mathematics at the foundational level rather than mother tongue at the higher level.&nbsp; That is a valid parental choice and we should respect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are also taking a more flexible approach to how they deliver the EM3 curriculum.&nbsp; We have given schools the flexibility to integrate EM3 pupils&nbsp;with their peers for specific subjects where there is educational merit in doing so.&nbsp; This is similar to the way in which&nbsp;schools are banding pupils in the regular classes according to their strengths and weaknesses in a&nbsp;specific subject.&nbsp; For example, many&nbsp;schools band their pupils by Mathematics ability and then, during the mother tongue period, they take them out and rearrange them in mother tongue classes in a different order. This is banding by subject strength.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2151<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, eight out of 10 primary schools no longer have \"pure\" EM3 classes, where EM3 students take all their subjects together.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words,&nbsp;EM3 students are now integrated with their peers in regular classes in subjects such as Social Studies, Art&nbsp;and Craft, Music, Health Education and Project Work, and Physical Education and Civics&nbsp;and Moral Education (CME), all of which are not examined at the PSLE.&nbsp; They are then taught in separate classes typically in the four core academic subjects, where their gaps in ability, compared to the regular students, are usually greatest.&nbsp; Depending on the profile of the EM3 students and the size of the class, sometimes the EM3 students also join the regular class for some other&nbsp;core academic subjects. But we leave it to the school, trusting their judgment as to what is educationally sound.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we will also do is to focus on early interventions that can help bridge some of the deficits in learning in the early primary years, as Mr Zainudin pointed out. &nbsp;The Learning Support Programme (LSP), which caters to students who are weak in their language and literacy skills in the early primary years, is working well.&nbsp; It has helped many of our weaker students catch up with their peers after one to two&nbsp;years in school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan and Mr Zainudin have asked if we could do more for the academically weaker pupils, besides the Learning Support Programme.&nbsp; At the end of Primary 2, schools determine the most appropriate form of support for those students who continue to face difficulties in learning and reading, usually through customised remediation programmes as they go on to Primary 3.&nbsp; Where schools have the additional resources, the Learning Support Coordinators would actually cater to&nbsp;selected groups of Primary 3 students, typically those who<p align=left>Column: 2152<p> were ex-Learning Support Programme students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Learning Support Programme, we have the&nbsp;Enhancing Achievement and Better Learning (ENABLE) Programme which provides support to Primary 2 and Primary 3 pupils with at least average academic or intellectual abilities but whose academic performance is not commensurate with their abilities.&nbsp; Here, too, the scheme&nbsp;is progressing&nbsp;quite well.&nbsp; What can we do further?&nbsp; We are providing more teachers to our schools and, through a variety of schemes that schools have, for example, \u201cbuddy reading\ufffd? programmes, various customised remedial programmes, parallel teaching that allows two teachers to split up a class in a particular subject or lesson in order to train the students&nbsp;at a different pace, or take them through different topics, all these things will become more the norm, as schools get more resources.&nbsp; But it will take time and, over the next four to five years as we recruit more and we are able to put more teachers into schools, there will be greater scope for differentiation and a more refined system of ability-based learning.&nbsp; So we are getting there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach, therefore, is to recognise the diverse talents and needs of our students, and find practical ways to motivate them to go as far as they can.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will keep refining our methods and keep the system flexible, and never assume that anything is an article of faith in education.&nbsp; We will also provide schools with more teachers in the coming years and improve teacher-student ratios, so that they will have, as I have explained,&nbsp;more room to experiment with flexible classroom arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked about&nbsp;our students showing lack of confidence and fearing the competition from foreign students.&nbsp; There will always be soundbites to that effect.&nbsp; In every society, you will&nbsp;find&nbsp;that <p align=left>Column: 2153<p>if you put a microphone in front of an average local, some nasty things will come out about the nearest foreigner, be it Indian, Chinese, Korean or Vietnamese.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most liberal, open and confident societies have that&nbsp; latent, not far beneath the&nbsp;surface.&nbsp; We are no different.&nbsp; But I think the weight of opinion in Singapore, youths and students included,&nbsp;is one of broad acceptance, not just of the need for foreigners from an economic point of view to be part of our system, but also the benefits&nbsp;the students themselves get by having foreigners in the class, pushing them on in their Chinese, sometimes edging them out from the table tennis team but which spurs them on to train harder and get back in.&nbsp; They like the fact that we have a more diverse international climate in our schools than we would if we were a parochial and closed society.&nbsp; Our students know they benefit from the exposure to the world that comes from this easy way, of bringing foreigners in.&nbsp; And if we were to rely only on Singaporeans to compete with each other, we will never make it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan spoke about the five-day work week, and I will explain very briefly that it is&nbsp;not the policy of the Ministry to move all Saturday activities to the weekdays.&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-day work week was implemented as part of the larger civil service move to be more pro-family.&nbsp; Our teachers are parents.&nbsp; They have their families, so they deserve their Saturday off as well.&nbsp; But we want to make sure we do not compromise on the quality of education we provide our students, including depth and quality of their CCA, CIP and the informal curriculum of the schools.&nbsp; So, in implementing the five-day work week, we have to balance these two considerations.&nbsp; We would&nbsp;not overburden the teachers, but should&nbsp;not&nbsp;compromise on the quality of&nbsp;education, particularly the quality of holistic education that we have been talking about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2154<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school day has indeed lengthened in some schools and junior colleges.&nbsp; Many students are getting home later, and getting home more tired, and that is not good for family life. &nbsp;So, schools are learning&nbsp;from the initial experience, first few months, and are re-calibrating their approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, I am encouraged by the progress of schools to rationalise their existing activities, and not merely shift all Saturday activities to weekdays.&nbsp; It will take a bit of time to settle, but I think there is good sense and a pragmatic attitude that our schools have on this matter.&nbsp; They are trying to find creative ways of using their teachers where they are most needed,&nbsp;relying more on external coaches, parent volunteers and, in the secondary schools and junior colleges, relying more on student leaders themselves to organise CCAs, so that we can still deliver a high-quality broad-based education without overburdening our teachers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo asked whether we are preparing the&nbsp;teachers&nbsp;adequately&nbsp;to implement the changes we are making.&nbsp;That is absolutely important.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have found that one of the most effective ways to implement changes in policies in education&nbsp;is to engender ownership amongst our&nbsp;teachers and our schools.&nbsp; But the implementation of our policies will seldom be perfectly even across the board.&nbsp; Some of our schools are ready earlier to take on the changes we are making.&nbsp; We will let them press on, and not hold them back until every school is ready.&nbsp; These leaders will set the pace for the rest to follow.&nbsp; What is important is that we should be able to&nbsp;encourage innovative teachers and innovative schools to share their best practices with each other.&nbsp; In&nbsp;that way, we level up the&nbsp;system over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that, in the midst of all the&nbsp;changes that are happening and in the <p align=left>Column: 2155<p>midst of the seeming stress that we often hear about on the part of both teachers and students,&nbsp;I am quite heartened by some of the&nbsp;tangible results that we are getting. &nbsp;Our recruitment programme is going very well.&nbsp; Last year, we recruited 2,000&nbsp;teachers, right up to target, despite the recovery of the economy.&nbsp; So far this year, we are well on target, in fact, slightly ahead.&nbsp; We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;recent survey commissioned by MOE of members of the public, a large sample.&nbsp;They&nbsp;ranked the teaching profession as that which contributes the most to society, above doctors and lawyers.&nbsp; This positive perception of the teaching profession is what helps us in our job, and it becomes a virtuous circle.&nbsp; As we get more teachers into the system, push them out into schools, improve the teacher-student ratios, give them more time to deliver quality teaching,&nbsp;the attraction of the profession also goes up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have raised a few other issues that&nbsp;I have not dealt with, including&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong's point about religious knowledge and several points on Special Education which my colleagues, MOS Chan and SPS Hawazi will be dealing with later.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</B>&nbsp;(<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;Sir, there is an ancient Chinese saying, \"<I>zi yi, xing nan</I>\", that is, to know is easy but to do is difficult.&nbsp; For any plans or measures to be successful, the key is in knowing how to specifically and thoroughly implement them, once the direction and principles are determined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese Language Pedagogy Reform report is a landmark in the language education in Singapore. Having extensively discussed it in Parliament, we should put our hearts and souls into pushing forward the implementation details as recommended.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that MOE has studied and explored various teaching methods, including \"recognising first, writing later\".&nbsp; I hope the Minister would enlighten us on the conclusions and suggestions of the Ministry's studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the teaching method, one other very important area is examination. This is because the process and style of examinations tightly restrain the teaching directions of the teachers, their teaching content at the schools and the learning attitude of the students.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the pedagogy reform to be successful, the mode of examinations should also be thoroughly reformed and be closely linked to the expected outcome of the learning process.&nbsp; The important point is that it has to be more diversified and more innovative. Only then, can we change the present phenomenon whereby students study just to pass their examinations.&nbsp; Once the examination model is defined, the teachers would be able to adapt to the new direction,<p align=left>Column: 2157<p> thereby changing their teaching modes and make the students' learning process more varied and diversified, and relevant to daily lives, so as to further enhance the students' interest in learning and change their learning attitude.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we must recognise that teachers are the key and soul of the implementation of the reform.&nbsp; I am somewhat worried that up till today, the MOE has not proposed any specific training plan for the teachers so as to prepare the teachers for the implementation of the pedagogy reform.&nbsp; The MOE seems to be \"great boast, small roast&nbsp;- much said, but little done\". The action does not follow through.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, MOE suddenly announced a reduction in the syllabus and some modules of the Chinese curriculum.&nbsp; This is actually a good measure.&nbsp; However, there seems to be a lack of communication in the implementation, resulting in many teachers, students and parents being caught by surprise.&nbsp; When interviewed on TV, one primary school student said, \"All of a sudden, the school deleted the text which I have learnt.&nbsp; How am I going to prepare for the PSLE?\"&nbsp; The student's remark illustrates two serious problems: first, the student's learning of the Chinese Language remains tailored at preparing for examinations; and&nbsp;second, it seems that the school, parents and teachers do not know what to do when they suddenly discovered that the teaching modules are reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By right, cutting out the text and teaching materials which are compulsorily fixed as curriculum is a good thing to do. In this way, the teachers could have more flexibility to lead the students in participating in more interesting learning activities, thereby laying a solid foundation for their language.&nbsp; However, when MOE takes the interim measures,<p align=left>Column: 2158<p> from the reaction of the primary school student, we can see that we need, first of all, to help the schools prepare the students and parents. I understand that in some schools, they are taking out the Primary 3 to Primary 5 textbooks and teaching them to fill the curriculum time vacated by the reduction in Primary 6 curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another preparatory work which cannot be delayed is that since we are going to commence the&nbsp;Chinese Language Pedagogy Reform&nbsp;in the primary schools in 2008, the pre-school sector, ie, kindergarten 1 and 2 classes must also have their curriculum revamped accordingly so as to prepare the students to dovetail into the new primary school reform. Otherwise, it would hamper the reform.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; MM Lee has said that we must develop a pool of 150 to 200 Chinese elites each year to strengthen our competitiveness.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China is playing an increasingly important role in the world's economy and politics.&nbsp; If we do not have bilingual Chinese elites, the role we play in East Asia and the world in trade and economy will soon be weakened.&nbsp; However, the university admission criteria have been changed.&nbsp; The mother tongue scores will no longer be counted. This has become an obstacle to our goal of developing a pool of&nbsp;Chinese elites. Students who have done&nbsp;Higher Chinese in&nbsp;secondary school&nbsp;may choose not to continue with Higher Chinese at \"A\" level and JC, since their scores will not be counted for their&nbsp; university admission in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of JC students taking Higher Chinese was reduced, enrolment in the Department of Chinese Studies will also drop. This is detrimental to&nbsp;our plan to nurture a pool of&nbsp;Chinese elites.&nbsp; I would suggest that in order to encourage<p align=left>Column: 2159<p> potential students to continue taking Higher Chinese, we should give them some incentives. May I suggest that the students who score \"A\" or \"B\" in Higher Chinese and intend to take Chinese in the university be classified as \"linguistic talents\".&nbsp; The bonus points for mother tongue should be increased from two points to four points. This would attract more students to take Higher Chinese.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Minister&nbsp;announced yesterday that the Ministry does&nbsp;not impose restrictions on&nbsp;schools which wish to open primary level&nbsp;Chinese elite classes.&nbsp; This has been welcomed by the parents.&nbsp; May I&nbsp;ask the Minister, currently,&nbsp;how many&nbsp;schools conduct&nbsp;Higher Chinese classes and if the Ministry would consider opening specialised Higher Chinese learning centres, for the convenience of students who wish to pursue&nbsp;Higher Chinese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Mother Tongue</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; Mr Chairman, yesterday at the Parliament library, I was having a chit-chat with Minister of State, Mr Chan Soo Sen when, full of zest, he suddenly recited an old Chinese poetry:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Or be a <I>Liaodong</I> hat, my integrity can brave the icy snow;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or be the command to send out the troop, even the ghosts will weep at the heroic and glorious deaths;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or be the oar of the boats crossing the river, vehemently conquering the barbarian enemies;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or be the tablet to hit at the traitors, breaking their heads.\ufffd?<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I marvel and admire MOS Chan for his mastery of the Chinese classics and his remarkable memory.&nbsp; Fortunately, I could at least remember that this came from the <p align=left>Column: 2160<p>\"<I>Zheng Qi Ge</I>\" (Ode to the Noble Spirit), a heroic poem by the renowned General Wen Tian Xiang of the Song Dynasty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coincidentally, I saw Dr Wang Kai Yuen reading a book of&nbsp;ancient poems yesterday. The first page of the book read:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I have the strength to move the mountain,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the time and luck are not with me;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even my faithful horse refuses to move,<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My beauty, my beauty, what can I do?\"<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately I saw, in my mind, <I>Xiang Yu</I>, the Conqueror of Western Chu Kingdom (\u897f \u695a&nbsp;\u9738 \u738b),</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">crying out at the bank of the river at the end of his resources. A good man caught in extremely difficult circumstances immersed in love with his beloved concubine. What a sad and heroic picture!<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are two passages of literature from the Chinese classics which are familiar to many Chinese school students of the past. However, this morning, when I read these passages to my young colleagues who came from the SAP schools, they seemed dazed and were completely at a loss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not blame them because over the last two to three decades, after rounds and rounds of reforms to the Chinese education, it seems that the standard of Chinese has gone down again and again.&nbsp; This is an undeniable fact. Our only hope now is on the implementation of the recommendations of the Chinese Language Curriculum and Pedagogy Reform White Paper which we endorsed last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early part of this year, MOE announced the relaxation of the Chinese language&nbsp;syllabus by cutting out a substantial number of prescribed texts.<p align=left>Column: 2161<p>This is worrying to many.&nbsp; By this reduction, the students would be learning less words and it would naturally impact on the learning of the Chinese language.&nbsp;Would it&nbsp;also imply that the standard of Chinese language would slide again?<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key now is&nbsp;whether or not our students and teachers could make use of the time vacated by this relaxation of the syllabus in other ways and deploy more flexible methods of teaching and learning. If the schools and teachers stick to the old methods of teaching Chinese, the standard of Chinese will definitely slide further.&nbsp; I think we should make the learning of Chinese livelier, then, and only then, can the standard of Chinese be raised.&nbsp; I am very glad to see that many schools are deploying all sorts of ingenious way to make the learning of Chinese more relevant to daily lives.&nbsp; On&nbsp;6th&nbsp;March, <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> had a comprehensive report on this.&nbsp; Now even the <I>kung fu</I> novels have gone into our curriculum. Some SAP primary schools are going to conduct \"Chinese elite classes\".&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry of Education will encourage all the schools to do likewise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from teaching, the examinations should also be livelier.&nbsp; We should not be testing the students on the number of words and phrases they can memorise any more. On the other hand, I think we should make them livelier so that the students would learn how to use Chinese for their daily conversation, to use Chinese to absorb knowledge, to upgrade themselves and to cultivate themselves to become virtuous persons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government wants to cultivate a pool of some 200 Chinese elites each year.&nbsp; I think this is not enough.&nbsp; We should not be confining ourselves to the cultural and educational fields only. We should cast the net wider to take in Chinese elites in the fields of politics, business and <p align=left>Column: 2162<p>the arts as well.&nbsp; We should involve even the civil servants and the professionals so that we&nbsp;have a lot of people who know the culture and language of China, in depth and&nbsp;breadth.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

In the 1950s, nearly all Singaporeans could speak bazaar Malay.&nbsp; English in those days was not spoken by the common working people, except a minority of Singaporeans who were educated in the English medium schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1954, the PAP was formed and it proclaimed <I>inter alia</I> in its first party manifesto as follows, \"A lingua franca is necessary and moral, political and practical considerations make Malay, rather than English, the&nbsp;obvious choice.&nbsp; The alleged inadequacy of the Malay language as a lingua franca is not disinterested propaganda.&nbsp; The Malay&nbsp;language in Indonesia, freed from Dutch colonial restraints, is rapidly becoming a comprehensive means of expression and communications in science and technology, commerce, industry and the&nbsp;humanities.&nbsp; By contrast, the Malay language in this colonial country remains static.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1954, the PAP's aim was to make Malay the lingua franca of Singapore.&nbsp; It nearly succeeded when Singapore joined Malaya to form Malaysia.&nbsp; In 1963, Malay was a compulsory subject in all Government and Government-aided schools, and all civil servants were required to study Malay.&nbsp; They all had to pass Standard One Malay; otherwise they could not&nbsp;be confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During that period from 1963-1965, when Singapore was part of Malaysia, the promotion and study of the Malay language amongst Singaporeans was at<p align=left>Column: 2163<p> its zenith.&nbsp; But the fall of the popularity of the Malay language as its rise was just as fast.&nbsp; After 1965, with the advent of the mother tongue policy in Singapore, where only Malay students were allowed to study Malay as&nbsp;a mother tongue or second language,&nbsp;all&nbsp;Singaporeans, who were non-Malays, did not study Malay and were quite ignorant of the subject.&nbsp; It is sad to know that almost all younger Singaporeans have not had the opportunity to learn basic Malay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is in the heart of the Malay world.&nbsp; Indonesia and Malaysia are our close neighbours.&nbsp; They have over 220 million people between them.&nbsp; Their economies, although not as strong as ours, are improving.&nbsp; I think it would benefit Singapore, if Singaporeans could communicate with people in these neighbouring countries in their language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased and happy to read in the <I>Straits Times</I> of&nbsp;18th February 2005 that the Education Ministry is considering an option to let students learn Malay or <I>Bahasa</I> as the third language - read, speak and understand it, without having to master the writing.&nbsp; I think Malay is a language important enough for Singapore to make it a compulsory subject at the elementary level.&nbsp; I would like to know whether the Minister is willing to make ML3 a mandatory, but not examination, subject in our schools.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I shall speak first in Mandarin.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>): Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to thank Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Ang Mong Seng and Dr Ong Seh Hong for their support for the Chinese language pedagogy reform and the many good suggestions they have made.&nbsp; For many of the issues raised, we have already deliberated very extensively during the debate on&nbsp;the White Paper.&nbsp; So I do not intend to go through them all over again.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2164<p> I would just like to report on what we have done after the adoption of the White Paper.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this reform would be fully implemented only in the year 2008, that is,&nbsp;four years from now, we have been following up intensively since the debate.&nbsp; Soon after the debate on the reform to the Chinese language pedagogy, we sent a MOE delegation of experts to <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp; to learn the teaching of Chinese language there.&nbsp; We discovered that from 1999, the concept of&nbsp; \"recognise first and write later\" has already been a main stream teaching strategy for CL in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>.&nbsp; We were surprised that in such traditional Chinese-speaking society where Chinese was read and written by everyone, they still consider it necessary to adopt this strategy in the teaching of Chinese to the young.&nbsp; I met some of the officials in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and they told me that it was very difficult for the children to learn Chinese using the ancient method.&nbsp; So, now, the new method of&nbsp; \"recognising first and writing later\" was to ensure that the students would be able to read at a younger age. The younger they start to learn, the younger they would be able to read the Chinese classics and story books. This is exactly the same argument we had when we debated the White Paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp;are also other points we could learn from PRC's approach in teaching CL.&nbsp; For example, they let the students&nbsp;learn, first of all, the radicals and the basic strokes.&nbsp; And, at the same time, for example, the characters \u4eba <I>ren</I>&nbsp; (man), \u4ece <I>cong</I> (follow) and \u4f17 <I>zhong</I> (public) all consist of the basic character \u4eba, except that it appears once, twice and thrice respectively. Likewise, the characters \u6728 <I>mu</I> (wood), \u6797 <I>lin</I> (woods) and \u68ee <I>seng</I> (forest\uff09.&nbsp; As a&nbsp;matter of fact, more often than not, the Chinese characters are formed by combining the radical and the basic strokes in fairly logical patterns.</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2165<p>\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also line up characters which look alike but are totally different in meaning.&nbsp; For example, \u6e05 (clear)\uff0c\u60c5 (feeling) and \u8bf7 (invite). The right hand side is the same but they follow different radicals, hence giving different meanings.&nbsp; For us, who already know Chinese, this may not appear intriguing.&nbsp; But, during our school days, there was no such systematic learning, and we just have to swallow them hook, line&nbsp;and sinker, learn them all by heart first and discover the logic later. Then, there was memorisation and dictation to test how well we remembered them. All these are hard work. If we insist on all these in today's context, we risk losing a lot of interest in the learning of the Chinese language.&nbsp; If we were taught more systematically, perhaps my Chinese would have been better now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has said, it was important for us to communicate with our teachers. I agree, and we are still in the process of doing so. Since we have not reached out to all teachers yet, I thought I just be general today in replying to Mr Yeo by giving him a maxim in 16 Chinese characters.&nbsp; First, we &nbsp;\u591a\ufffd?\ufffd\u591a\u8bb2, develop proficiency in oral and aural skills first by listening more and speaking more.&nbsp; Secondly, we go for \u6709\u6548\u8ba4\u5b57, that is, recognise the characters effectively. After that, &nbsp;\u591a\u8bfb\u591a\u5199 - follow with reading and writing, and finally we hope that our students would \u5b66\u4e60\u6109\u5feb, enjoy learning the Chinese language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this maxim of 16 characters, I could sum up our strategy, that is, we want to listen more, speak more, effectively learning and be happy in our learning.&nbsp; In the not too distant future, and after our discussion with our teachers, we will announce the details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also formed a Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning<p align=left>Column: 2166<p>(CPCLL) to rally the strengths of the community so that we would be able to implement and realise all the solutions that were proposed in the White Paper. This Steering Committee comprises&nbsp;people from various quarters who are concerned with the Chinese language and, in fact, a number of our MPs are also members of the Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have decided in our first meeting that we had done enough talking and it was time for us to get down to action.&nbsp; So we have started five taskforces.&nbsp; One taskforce is for reading and reading materials; the second is to promote writing of Chinese; the third concerns the&nbsp;media; the fourth is to promote cultural exchange, and the fifth&nbsp; is on pre-school Chinese Education. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang heads the taskforce for Chinese in&nbsp;pre-school education. Just now, he talked about the solution for this aspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he could include the excellent suggestions he gave just now for the work of his taskforce.&nbsp; When you want to communicate with the players in this field, do remember what you said in Parliament today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang expressed concern over the teaching of Chinese language.&nbsp;They asked&nbsp;about the reduction of the text and some modules in the Chinese language.&nbsp; I think from this incident, there are a few things that we can learn.&nbsp; First, as Dr Ong Seh Hong has said, when we assess the standard of Chinese of our students, we should not just test whether they can memorise <I>Zheng Qi Ke</I> or <I>Haixia Ke.</I> It should not be based on how many words, phrases or idioms that you can memorise.&nbsp; The important thing is whether or not you have that confidence to use the Chinese language and spoken Mandarin, such as to converse, to read newspapers, and&nbsp;to write reports or file some applications to the relevant authorities.&nbsp; The teaching and learning of Chinese language must be<p align=left>Column: 2167<p> down-to-earth.&nbsp; It must be relevant to our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember during my younger days when we were learning Chinese, it was a different story.&nbsp; We had 92 pieces of selected work to learn and these included <I>Zheng Qi Ke</I> and <I>Xiang Yu Ben Ji</I> <I>where Haixia Ke</I> <I>came from</I>.&nbsp; Our teacher told us to memorise these 92 chapters and the whole examination will be based on them. Today, our examination is not like that.&nbsp; It does not matter what chapters or what passages&nbsp;you have read.&nbsp; You will be examined on how you apply your knowledge of the language.&nbsp; When we cut down on the number of prescribed texts, so long as your practical application of the language is not&nbsp; affected, you will still be able to sit for the examination and get good results. There is therefore no question of cutting down on some prescribed texts, and CL standard is lowered. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The curriculum is to define your study direction and objective.&nbsp; This objective need not be attained by studying the prescribed text.&nbsp; For example, if you read Jin Yong's <I>kung fu</I> novels, and if you can attain the expected outcome of teaching, it is a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing is that we want to give the teachers more free time so that they can put their creativity and ingenuity into action.&nbsp; They are in the frontline.&nbsp; They are the best people to know what the needs of the students are.&nbsp; They want to do their job well.&nbsp; They are all professionals.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp;if&nbsp;we give them more space and time, they will be able to use their ingenious ways to teach the students with materials which are more relevant to their daily lives, and it will enhance the students' interest in learning.&nbsp; Such teaching methods would be more effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng mentioned Higher Chinese.&nbsp; He expressed regret that the<p align=left>Column: 2168<p> Chinese results were not taken into consideration for university admission.&nbsp; We had actually discussed this before.&nbsp; For university enrolment, it would have to be assessed on whether or not the student has the aptitude to take the course that he wants to pursue.&nbsp; Perhaps the university can stipulate that if students want to apply for admission to the Chinese Language Department, priority will be given to those who have scored well in Higher Chinese.&nbsp; But if their Chinese is very good and we give them four merit points to get into any faculty whose subjects of study have nothing to do with CL, then I think this will affect the enrolment in the university,&nbsp;and it will be regressive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the status of Chinese today is such that we need not go through entry requirement to attract students to learn Chinese.&nbsp; All parents know that Chinese Language is very important.&nbsp; When we are conducting the bi-cultural course, we did not expect some 800 students to apply for the 200 places.&nbsp; In the end, the schools tried their best to accommodate and accepted 300 students.&nbsp; So we can see that the students really know the importance of learning Chinese.&nbsp; We do not need entry requirement to induce the students to learn Chinese.&nbsp; The status of Chinese is so obvious that our students would want to learn Chinese, and the parents would encourage the students to learn Chinese, and to learn it well.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In English):</I>&nbsp; Since I am unable to reply in Malay, perhaps I will respond to Mr Chiam's question about Bahasa Melayu in English.&nbsp; I did study Malay during those early days.&nbsp; After I joined the civil service, I also went to a Malay class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with Mr Chiam that Malay language is important.&nbsp; It is an important regional language.&nbsp; But this has got to be seen in context.&nbsp; All the examples cited by <p align=left>Column: 2169<p>Mr Chiam were during pre-independent days.&nbsp; The setting at that time was very different.&nbsp; Since then, English has become a working language and our bilingual policy requires all students to study English as well as their mother tongues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we debated the White Paper on Chinese Education, the point that it is very difficult for students to master two languages is already established.&nbsp; In fact, the number of students who can master two languages effectively is very small.&nbsp; If, in addition to English and mother tongue, all students are made to study Malay, I fear the pressure on students, teachers and parents may become unbearable.&nbsp; But having said that, allowing students who are already doing well in English and mother tongue to study Malay as an elective subject is already available since the mid-80s.&nbsp; There is a Malay Special programme where students, who are within the top 30% and do very well in mother tongue as well as English, can opt for this special programme at Secondary 1, leading to an examination and qualification at 'O' level.&nbsp; The equivalent standard is Standard 2, which is slightly higher than Standard 1. There are about 300 students who are doing this subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular programme will continue, and we are confident that when people begin to understand that to be proficient in an additional language is like holding an additional passport, more would study Malay language, as in the Malay Special programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have schools who, on their own initiative, have initiated some conversational Malay programmes for their pupils.&nbsp; We, in the Ministry of Education, support these initiatives on the part of the schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the civil service is concerned, the Civil Service College still<p align=left>Column: 2170<p> offers basic conversational Malay course.&nbsp; Civil servants who need to study Malay can enrol in this course.&nbsp; Of course, there are also public officers whose jobs require them to be more proficient in the Malay language, such as some SAF or Ministry of Foreign Affairs officers. The Ministries have their own programmes for them to learn the Malay language.&nbsp; In other words, all the channels available for those who want to study Malay are already there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I need to respond to Mr Ang Mong Seng's point about the elite Chinese programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In Mandarin):</I>&nbsp; This is a new initiative by Tao Nan School. We do not know how our students and parents would take to the programme. If the students spend more time learning Chinese, then they will have less time for English.&nbsp; The result could be that their standard of Chinese would be raised, probably at the expense of their standard of English being lowered. So let us see how it goes. More importantly, it depends on the parents.&nbsp; If the response is good, the Hokkien Huay Kuan has already said that they intend to extend the project to other Hokkien Huay Kuan schools.&nbsp; If other schools find this project a good idea, they may also conduct similar programmes.&nbsp; MOE is prepared to let them try these out.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, a point of clarification.&nbsp; The Minister said that we have four years to do things slowly.&nbsp; But I have just worked it out and it is only three years and three months.&nbsp; We would start in January&nbsp;2008.&nbsp; I do not know how the Minister did his calculation.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more important point is that on pre-school education, we have the responsibility to push and promote pre-school education.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;been made&nbsp;a committee Chairman.&nbsp; I will just stick&nbsp;my neck out and do it.&nbsp; But, to a large extent, this pre-school education depends very much on the Ministry of Education,<p align=left>Column: 2171<p> because there is no framework provided by the MOE.&nbsp; To many operators, they do not have any standard to follow.&nbsp; Unless the Ministry can&nbsp;spell out the clear standards, there will be no guiding principle or framework to&nbsp;control this kind of educational work. &nbsp;On the other hand, the operators of the pre-school establishments will have to grope in the dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister&nbsp;also said that our examination system is diversified.&nbsp; Even up till today our students, primary or secondary, are still learning by rote.&nbsp; Why is it so?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chan Soo Sen</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; So, it is three years and three months.

Another one is on the examination framework.&nbsp; How do we make use of the time and space vacated from the relaxation of the curriculum?&nbsp; The Ministry will not micro-manage and tell the teachers how to make use of the extra time. Different schools, different students have different needs and different demands. The teachers know this better than the Ministry. Some schools may want to use more time to teach the prescribed texts, while some students may want to use the spare time to read newspapers and write reports.&nbsp; Mr Yeo mentioned that some teachers use the time to revise the Secondary 2 and 3 lessons.&nbsp; All these arrangements will depend on the needs of the students.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talking about relaxation of control, a person who has been tied up for a long period of time will probably be unable to walk properly when he is suddenly freed.&nbsp; But, after some warming up, he will be able to adjust himself and find his proper steps.

I am confident about our CL teachers. Those newspaper reports are examples that come to the ears of the newspapers. It is not exhaustive. There are many more such examples of creative teaching.

In other words, look not just at curriculum review but also at the standards in the examinations of the landmark at national levels, and then what is happening in the schools in the intervening years where examinations are set, and then that&nbsp;percolates down to school assignments and assessments.&nbsp; I think that is an important part of this review.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on timing.&nbsp; The points have been raised in the context of other reviews.&nbsp; It is essential that this review be completed this year and there should be some immediate benefits to the schools and to the students in the schools from next year onwards.&nbsp; It is scant comfort to know that three years from now, the curriculum will be modified to make it easier for students.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alexander Chan Meng Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, in an IPS survey of 1999 involving a random sample of 1,451 Singaporean citizens between 15 and 64 of age, it was noticed that Singaporeans were generally very positive and very strongly patriotic to the country when abstract concepts, like pride, sense of belonging, and what Singapore means to them were mentioned.&nbsp; On the other hand, questions regarding more economic and pragmatic issues, like job loss, defending the nation in periods of tension, returned less wholly positive answers.&nbsp; There was also a strong positive correlation between age of respondents and national pride score.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2177<p> Apparently, the younger the Singaporeans, the lesser their national pride.&nbsp;In my view, strong feelings for Singapore are built up over a long period of time, reinforced by positive experiences but also damaged by unfavourable experiences.&nbsp; This just means that the process must start from young and in school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During school age, what happens?&nbsp; Our children are managed and&nbsp;educated by our schools,&nbsp;first, in the primary school for six years, and then potentially by a different institution, a secondary school for four years, and then another set of institutions - the JCs, ITE or&nbsp;polytechnics and, subsequently, perhaps the universities.&nbsp; Or, if you are a Singaporean male, you&nbsp;are then handed over to the SAF.&nbsp; Thereafter, they are released to the workplace.&nbsp; In each case, the responsible organisation, more or less, fully consumes the available time for its primary purposes, whether that be for education, in the case of schools, or for military training.&nbsp; This leaves very little precious time for other purposes, such as building community relations, enhancing rootedness and love for Singapore and, furthermore, developing a more than&nbsp;superficial understanding about our own and neighbouring cultures.&nbsp; In fact, our system insulates and segments, perhaps, inadvertently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think we already lack&nbsp;the number and the variety of different organisations' activities and substantial linkages for our school children into the community.&nbsp;We do not have a&nbsp;surfeit of organisations that can be a kind of a common platform, a familiar vehicle to carry children from childhood into young adulthood, other than our shopping centres.&nbsp; The idea here is that our children can be involved in such organisations on a regular basis that will become potential anchors to&nbsp;enhance rootedness.&nbsp; I applaud the Minister for leading the rapid and widespread<p align=left>Column: 2178<p> transformation of our education system to inject more positive experiences with its renewed emphasis on teaching, less learning more, the changes to mother tongue teaching, the call for more sports, a new admission system, beefing up the teaching cadre and opening up of school sports facilities to the public.&nbsp;However, I wish to ask the Minister for Education what MOE is doing to develop more team work, a stronger sense of community, nationhood, regional understanding and, also, how&nbsp;our schools can be better plugged into our community for both students and staff.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our teachers engage<p align=left>Column: 2182<p> students in interaction using an array of language activities which includes story telling, debate, singing and poetry recitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools also organise Malay Language activities, such as camps and cultural events, to encourage oral communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;We look forward to more suggestions from the Malay Language Review Committee on how we can further enhance the oral competency of our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on Mr Ong Ah Heng's questions about the effectiveness of our sexuality education programme,&nbsp;this is also a concern to us.&nbsp; Allow me to update Members on its implementation in schools.<br>\r\n<I><br>\r\n</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality issues and norms have become more complicated today in a globalised world that is undergoing rapid changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a situation not peculiar only to Singapore, as other countries that are becoming more open and cosmopolitan also face this same challenge.&nbsp; We will therefore need the family and the wider community to play their part to shape the sexuality attitudes and behaviours of our students.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At MOE, we have taken a proactive approach by implementing an age-appropriate sexuality programme in our schools.&nbsp; This programme adopts a holistic approach towards the issue of sexuality, including the physical, emotional, social, intellectual and ethical dimensions of sexuality.&nbsp; Sex education, on the other hand, focuses solely on the physical dimension and is usually taught to married couples.&nbsp; Mr Ong cited the example of schools in some cities&nbsp;in China which&nbsp;have introduced what he termed as&nbsp;sex education.&nbsp; I am not sure whether it is really sex education or sexuality education.&nbsp; However, if this is useful for us to take a look at their experiences and how they design the curriculum and programmes for their pupils, we will do so&nbsp;and see what we can learn from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2183<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We aim to provide students with accurate knowledge about sexuality, inculcate sound values and equip students with relevant skills to build healthy relationships and make responsible decisions regarding their sexual behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sexuality education programme is premised on the importance of the family, and respect of the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities on sexuality issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme has been well received in our schools.&nbsp; Teachers felt that it was comprehensive and well thought through. &nbsp;The students felt that the lessons provided a legitimate platform for them to discuss the issues that were commonly considered \u201ctaboo\ufffd?, but they would like to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teenage pregnancies and abortion are complex issues.&nbsp; Lack of family support, low self-esteem, sexual abuse and a lack of understanding of responsibilities in relationships are also factors associated with teenage pregnancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey by MOE in 2004 to gauge the impact of the sexuality education programme was conducted on eight secondary schools and covered over 2,000 pupils.&nbsp; Students' responses to pre- and post-programme questionnaires indicate a significant increase in their understanding of sexuality matters, including the negative consequences of teenage sexual activities.&nbsp; There is also a generally positive shift&nbsp; in the students' attitude towards sexuality matters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I><br>\r\n</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sexuality education programme is still in its early stage of implementation, with the post-secondary package only implemented in JCs last year.&nbsp; We will be evaluating the programme at the upper primary and the JC and Centralised Institute (CI) level this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexuality education is not an easy subject to teach.&nbsp; If we over-teach the subject, we may not get the right results.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2184<p> It is also&nbsp;much more than knowledge about sexual reproduction.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;about attitudes and beliefs towards sexuality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools need to be sensitive to the students' developmental needs and their level of understanding in order to engage them.&nbsp; Above all, our teachers need to use effective teaching methods to bring the subject alive to impact the students.&nbsp; We will continually review our programme to ensure that it meets the challenges in our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that MOE agrees totally with the importance of sexuality education for our students.&nbsp;&nbsp;While schools and family provide the primary contexts for the inculcation of positive attitudes towards sexuality matters, the larger communities, other Government agencies, and the media, can also play an effective role in influencing these positive behaviours and attitudes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, we can help our youths make more informed and responsible choices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin Nordin asked what MOE is doing to assist parents who cannot afford pocket money and textbooks for their children in schools and whether these students will be disadvantaged because of their situation.&nbsp; The MOE Financial Assistance Scheme provides for students from low-income households.&nbsp; This scheme grants waiver of school fees and part of the miscellaneous fees, and provides free textbooks to students too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, this scheme had benefited a total of 14,646 students, compared to 11,471 in 2003 and 7,387 in 2002.&nbsp; The&nbsp;larger number of students means that&nbsp;more are benefiting from the scheme.&nbsp; For this year, as of February, schools have already processed and approved over 12,000 applications. &nbsp;This number covers 9% of students living&nbsp;in HDB one to three-room flats, and 2% of those staying in four to five-room flats.&nbsp; We estimate the<p align=left>Column: 2185<p> total financial assistance to be given this year to be about&nbsp;$1.5 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students can use the funds in their Edusave accounts to pay for their second-tier miscellaneous fees.&nbsp; This year, the Edusave Pupils Fund contribution rate by the Government for students at the primary level has been increased by $10 from $160 to $170, and for students at the secondary level by $40 from $160 to $200.&nbsp; As announced by PM in his Budget Statement, there will also be a once-off top-up of $100 to the Edusave accounts of every primary and secondary pupil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School Advisory or School Management Committees will also provide additional support to needy pupils which may take the form of pocket money, settlement of fee arrears, free meals, stationery and uniforms.&nbsp; In 2004, the School Advisory Committees provided $3 million worth of financial assistance and bursaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Development Councils administer a number of social assistance schemes to help low-income families and families that need help to tide over a difficult period.&nbsp; Such assistance is necessary so that our students do not have to stop schooling to support their families.&nbsp; Dr Warren Lee spoke about this during the Budget debate and I want to reassure him that students who had left school prematurely can seek re-admission into our school system if they want to continue with their education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate organisations, such as SembCorp Marine, also provide financial grant to assist low-income households with schooling children to purchase school textbooks, uniforms and stationery.&nbsp; SembCorp Marine has done these for a few&nbsp;years and has been working directly&nbsp;with the Ministry of Education in the past two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, these financial<p align=left>Column: 2186<p> assistance schemes from MOE and the wider community ensure that no child is denied an education on&nbsp;account of financial difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong suggested that we teach Religious Knowledge to primary school pupils to promote racial harmony.&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with Dr Ong on the need to promote racial harmony in school.&nbsp; This is currently done through Civics and Moral Education (CME), where students are exposed to the different religious and cultural customs, beliefs and practices in Singapore.&nbsp; The purpose is to foster the value of respect for others in our students from the primary to pre-university level, rather than impart religious beliefs to them, which should not be the role of our schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a secular state, we feel that this approach is more appropriate and coherent in promoting racial harmony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has set up the Committee on Strengthening Racial Harmony in Schools, which I chair, with the&nbsp;aim of&nbsp;helping schools broaden and deepen inter-racial understanding and mixing in their schools.&nbsp; The committee comprises representatives from MOE, schools, parent support groups,&nbsp;and community leaders who have been nominated by CDCs.&nbsp; For example, the Racial Harmony Day on 21st July each year is one&nbsp;key event among the many activities and programmes carried out by schools to promote inter-racial understanding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Alex Chan asked whether MOE encourages students' participation in community organisations and also how MOE is developing a sense of rootedness, patriotism and, increasingly, a regional identity in our students.&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully agree with him that it is imperative for us to develop in our students a strong sense of belonging to their community and to the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In schools, we strive to impart these national instincts and values through our<p align=left>Column: 2187<p> National Education programmes, Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)&nbsp;and Community Involvement programmes (CIP).&nbsp;&nbsp;National Education is also infused in&nbsp; subjects, such as Civics&nbsp;and Moral Education, as well as Social Studies. Teachers use varied teaching approaches, such as discussions, case studies and Learning Journeys.&nbsp; Pre-university students also attend dialogue sessions with senior civil servants on topics such as economic competitiveness and governance.&nbsp; So there is a wide range of activities and programmes&nbsp;for us to impart a sense of rootedness and belonging to the country&nbsp;in our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will agree that teaching more does not mean learning more.&nbsp; Values are often \u201ccaught\ufffd? and not \u201ctaught\ufffd?.&nbsp; National Education&nbsp;has to be authentic and meaningful, experienced and felt by the students.&nbsp; Therefore, opportunities have to be created for students to undergo experiences that will help them internalise these values.&nbsp; Co-curricular activities play a key role.&nbsp;&nbsp;And here I fully agree with Mr Alex Chan on the importance of giving our students opportunities to connect with organisations out there, including through sports organisations.&nbsp; Through CCAs, our students form&nbsp;life-long friendships.&nbsp; Sports is a particularly good&nbsp;CCA to bond students and their community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Alex Chan may be pleased to note that MOE encourages schools to establish links with sports clubs.&nbsp; Clubs, such as the Singapore Cricket Club, Singapore Recreation Club, Ceylon Sports Club and the Singapore Indian Association, organise youth development programmes to nurture and train young sports talents.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also student hockey players in schools, such as Tampines Junior College and Yuhua Secondary, who play for local clubs in the Singapore Hockey Federation League tournament.&nbsp; So there are opportunities for them, and&nbsp;the students&nbsp;have taken&nbsp;up the opportunities to play with the big boys, so to say, in the league<p align=left>Column: 2188<p> and, hopefully, that&nbsp;will give them the connection&nbsp;to the larger community too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Involvement Programme provides yet another platform for students to build connections with their wider community.&nbsp; Some of our students</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>conduct reading programmes in libraries, while others visit old folks' homes to interact with the elderly residents and help with the maintenance of these homes.&nbsp; Our schools have also collaborated with various organisations to broaden and deepen students' involvement in community outreach projects.&nbsp; Such organisations include Community Clubs, Community Development Councils, the National Youth Council and the Singapore International Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we understand that the transmission of national instincts and values to our students is a long process.&nbsp; The family, the community and&nbsp;the society play no less a critical role in shaping these values in our young.&nbsp; I do not think this is a role that we should only give to the schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, the real measure of success of our efforts lies in how our students instinctively respond to a national or regional crisis.&nbsp; If the positive and caring spirit of our students and Singaporeans during SARS or the tsunami disaster is of any indication, I am confident that we are on the right track in preparing future citizens of Singapore.&nbsp; Working together with parents and the community, our schools will continue to strive to ensure that our students are imbued with a sense of love, loyalty and belonging to the community and to Singapore.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Iswaran:</B> Mr Chairman, I appreciate the Senior Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that the Ministry would implement the recommendations&nbsp;of the review that can be implemented <p align=left>Column: 2189<p>immediately.&nbsp; But I seek a more specific assurance, not something so generic, because past experience has shown that three elements&nbsp;have to be&nbsp;synchronised - curriculum design, national examination standards, school-based teaching and standards of tests or any other assessments&nbsp;in schools.&nbsp;These must work in tandem.

This basic principle is correct.&nbsp; However, I feel that for our education system to be thoroughly successful, it would still depend very much on our teachers.&nbsp; Therefore, we should review our teaching service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the Ministry of Education should evaluate the workload of our teachers.&nbsp; Now that they are required to teach less and make the students learn more, the traditional teaching methods can no longer be used. The teachers have to be innovative and deploy creative ways to teach, and have more time to interact with the students. They also need more time to prepare their teaching materials.&nbsp; With the heavy workload they are having now, they may not have the space to carry out this innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the curriculum has also been changed and reformed.&nbsp; Teachers need to be trained to adapt to them.&nbsp; I think we should have the teachers' consent because some of them grew up in the old system.&nbsp; We should listen to their views and adjust our policies.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, perhaps we should provide our teachers with more administrative assistants so that they could concentrate on teaching. This may incur more cost, but I think it is worth it, for the benefit of our next generation. Teachers are very important in this reform of the system.&nbsp; No matter how good our policies are, we need to have dedicated teachers so that the reform could be successful.&nbsp; We always say that teachers are the engineers of our souls.&nbsp; I think we should improve their working condition.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:&nbsp;</B> Mr Charles Chong is not here.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Schools of the Future</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin Nordin:</B>&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, I would just like to describe a scene.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 2196<p>scene is familiar.&nbsp; A teacher stands at the front of her room, children sit in the centre, their seats arranged in rows or semi-circles.&nbsp; There is a chalk-board or white-board, a wall map and a globe.&nbsp; This could be a classroom in 2005, 1995, 1859 or even 1795.&nbsp; Although the details may vary, school design has seen few changes in the past 200 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, with the aim to provide our children with a balanced and well-rounded education, develop them to their full potential and nurture them into good citizens, we continue to invest heavily in public education infrastructure and facilities.&nbsp; However, are we designing our schools to be education factories?&nbsp; Have we looked into aspects of architectural design, space planning, natural flow and ergonomics?&nbsp; We should be concerned with not only the software but also the hardware.&nbsp; The infrastructure and the facilities must align with MOE's vision.&nbsp; To encourage creativity and balance, the hardware need not necessarily be hard and cold and we should factor in design aspects that create a soft and warm environment, which is more inviting, conducive and reflect the new thrust in our education system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, Sir, may I propose that MOE be involved and work closely with the designers and architects, who share the vision of MOE, to develop our future schools that are progressive and modern in nature.&nbsp; Study has shown that students' achievement and behaviour&nbsp;relate to the physical building conditions and overcrowding has&nbsp;an effect&nbsp;on their performance.&nbsp; Good facilities appear to be an important pre-condition for student learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Ivan Png Paak Liang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools (PRIME)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Ivan Png Paak Liang:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is somewhat related to the point made by the hon.

Today, the way we have special education seems to be in two sort of&nbsp;quite disparate models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is the kind of integration model where students with special needs go to mainstream schools where they have the ability to keep up or cope with the curriculum there and, normally, they have to take some kind of test or be assessed before they could be admitted.&nbsp; This is an ideal model, particularly from the special needs students' perspective, but very few could actually benefit because of the high demands of our mainstream system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other model at the&nbsp;other end of the spectrum&nbsp;is the customised special education schools, which cater to the specific needs of students with special educational requirements.&nbsp; It has the advantage of being able to cater to a far wider ability range among such students.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the disadvantage remains that it is decoupled from the mainstream and from students who are really part and parcel of the society that students with special needs and mainstream students are integrated within.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2198<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is generally acknowledged that interaction between the two groups is desirable and of mutual benefit to both sides, both in terms of character development, to some extent pedagogic development and, in general, part of our own social and civil consciousness of being part of the society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the question really is:&nbsp; can we pursue some other model or some other means of promoting this kind of integration?&nbsp; One of the thoughts that has been thrown around in the past is the idea of co-locating special schools and mainstream schools, so that they are physically on adjacent premises.&nbsp; What that allows is for integration for certain aspects of the curriculum, be it, for example, in art or physical education or some of the ECA and social activities, and yet allowing for separation for the pursuit of academic matters&nbsp;and so on.&nbsp; The advantage of such a system is that the interaction amongst the students would occur quite naturally and would not have to be orchestrated in the sense that there is actually a special excursion or event&nbsp;when the two groups of students come together to go wherever it is.&nbsp; So the question I have really is whether the Ministry is pursuing this model and, if so, what is the state of development of that idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I raised this under the Ministry of Education because it&nbsp;is not clear to me whether this&nbsp;initiative, if undertaken, would fall under the Ministry of Education or under MCYS, or whether it requires a joint response.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Compulsory Education for Children with Disabilities</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen:</B>&nbsp; Sir, when the Compulsory Education&nbsp;Act (CEA) was introduced in 2000, children with<p align=left>Column: 2199<p> disabilities were exempted.&nbsp; I believe we should relook this decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously the CE committee had said it did not intend to use the Act as a means to improve access to and support for children with special needs.&nbsp; But, now, the Government has said that it wants to progressively integrate the disabled into society.&nbsp; This would mean acting to ensure the disabled are not kept out from the mainstream.&nbsp; Hence, unless there is a medical diagnosis that a child cannot be educated, CE should apply to them as it applies to the mainstream.&nbsp; This is not a call for all disabled children to attend national schools.&nbsp; I know Special Education&nbsp;Schools (SPED)&nbsp;offer&nbsp;specially-tailored programmes with specially-trained teachers, special facilities and more time and attention for our special children.&nbsp; But why not include SPED schools in the Act?&nbsp; It was said that exemption from CE gives flexibility to families of children who need special care.&nbsp; Should it not be the Act that should be flexible for the children's benefit?&nbsp; Because the point we all accept as the reason we have CE is that education is vital for our children and we must protect every child's right to an education.&nbsp; Let us keep to this spirit and extend it to the disabled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE need not run SPED&nbsp;schools to make education compulsory for the disabled children.&nbsp; It already works closely with VWOs to support these schools.&nbsp; Since 2000, it has reviewed its&nbsp;funding programmes for these schools and provided more help in teacher training and curriculum upgrading.&nbsp; We have more SPED schools now than in 2000.&nbsp; The older ones are getting new homes and facilities with help from MOE, which is allocating $55 million yearly, starting this year, to 2008, to improve education for the disabled children.&nbsp; Because the groundwork is done, it means the conditions are right and ripe to do away with an exemption.&nbsp; Even if children are put on the waiting list, it would not<p align=left>Column: 2200<p> excuse parents from shirking their duties.&nbsp; The committee has said it may be too harsh to enforce CE on families with special children.&nbsp; I agree these families need help to overcome their difficulties, financial or otherwise.&nbsp; Struggling or dysfunctional families with&nbsp;abled children need help too, and they do get help.&nbsp; Are they&nbsp;excluded from CE?&nbsp; It should be no different for the disabled children unless our many-helping-hands approach is inadequate.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to, at least, consider making education compulsory for the disabled children who qualify for mainstream schools as the exemption covers children with physical disabilities whose IQs can be higher than mainstream children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If education is compulsory in national schools and one qualifies for these schools, should not special education be compulsory?&nbsp; There are early intervention programmes that could determine if children with disabilities could cope with mainstream education.&nbsp; At least, let us start somewhere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I certainly agree with Mr Gan Kim Yong that teachers&nbsp;are the cornerstone and the guarantee that our educational programmes would be implemented well in school.&nbsp; They play key roles in all our educational programmes.&nbsp; In my earlier response to questions on Chinese education, for example, you see how I had emphasised the important roles of the teachers.&nbsp; Yes, it is important to ensure that good people continue to join the Education Service and it is also important to ensure that the working conditions of the teachers who are in the service are well taken care of. We want them to have more time and energy to reflect on what they do, innovate, and try new methods.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very pleased to report that over the last few years, we have been able to grow the ranks of our Education Service.&nbsp; We have been able to increase the<p align=left>Column: 2201<p> number of teaching staff from 23,000 teachers in 2000 to 27,000 in 2004.&nbsp; It is a 17% increase and, we have achieved this without compromising on quality.&nbsp; In fact, if anything, the quality has gone up.&nbsp; In 2000, only 48% of the teachers recruited were graduates.&nbsp; In 2004, it was 74%.&nbsp; We continue to be rigorous in our selection and training of teachers. In fact, we have introduced a lot of other programmes to ensure that they keep up with the changes in times so that they could continue to teach and guide the students.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-graduate teachers could take up degree programmes, for example, either full-time or part-time.&nbsp; We also have the Professional Development Leave Scheme (PDL) to allow graduate teachers to pursue post-graduate qualifications.&nbsp; There is also the Teacher Work Attachment (TWA) Programme&nbsp; to allow teachers to spend some time with industry and the private sector to know what is it like outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004, for example, 132 teachers were granted study leave to pursue their undergraduate studies.&nbsp; 102 were granted PDL to pursue their post-graduate studies.&nbsp; We have awarded post-graduate scholarships to 39 teachers. The TWA, which was introduced in 2003, also received very good response.&nbsp; So far, we have about 640 teachers who have taken up local and overseas attachments with schools as well as public and private organisations.&nbsp; Some interesting examples include attachments with the National University of Laos and the CitiGroup Overseas offices, as well as local institutions such as SingHealth Group and the Singapore Business Federation.&nbsp; So, we do have a good programme to expose our teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Mr Gan Kim Yong mentioned about teachers' workload and, I think, Mdm Ho Geok Choo earlier on also mentioned the same point.&nbsp; To reduce the <p align=left>Column: 2202<p>teachers' workload we would be doing a few things.&nbsp; First, we would be providing more resources to our schools so that they have the autonomy to decide how best to use them to supplement their manpower needs.&nbsp; For example, they could engage additional temporary or permanent manpower to support the teachers.&nbsp; In 2005, we have set aside an additional $12 million to increase the manpower grant for the schools.&nbsp; The grant to a primary school would be increased from the current $60,000 to $100,000 a year.&nbsp; For the secondary schools, junior colleges and CIs, it would be increased from $100,000 to about $130,000-$140,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>This is a significant increase in allocation, and the schools will be able to engage two or three more relief teachers above their teacher quota or buy services, like teaching assistants and so on, to handle specific administrative tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n5.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing that we are going to do is to recruit more teachers.&nbsp; The Prime Minister, during last year's National Day Rally, said that over the next five years, the Ministry of Education will be providing about 3,000 more teachers to the schools.&nbsp; This is a 15% net increase from the current teaching force which, as I mentioned earlier, has been expanded by 17% since year 2000.&nbsp; By 2010, there will be a net increase of 1,000 primary school teachers, 1,400 secondary school teachers and 550 JC/CI teachers.&nbsp; This translates to an increase of roughly 10 teachers in every school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Ministry of Education also plans to deploy at least one school counsellor to every secondary school by 2006 and at least one school counsellor to every primary school and JC by 2008.&nbsp; We will also train more teachers as teacher counsellors in schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope that with this additional manpower in schools, there will be better <p align=left>Column: 2203<p>spreading of the load.&nbsp; But we can achieve more than this. With greater capacity in schools, the teachers will have more time to plan and experiment with teaching approaches that will deliver the best education outcomes for their students as well as to respond to their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also looked at other sources to recruit teachers.&nbsp; For example, we have introduced a new adjunct teacher scheme since October 2004 to attract former trained teachers, eg, those who have retired or who have left service, to rejoin the teaching profession.&nbsp; We feel that this scheme will not only support our teachers but also provide an avenue for the Ministry of Education to retain the expertise and institutional knowledge of experienced teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special education was also mentioned.&nbsp; In order to provide more specialised support for students with learning disabilities in our schools, the Ministry of Education will also recruit, over the next five years, about 230 Special Needs Officers.&nbsp; These officers will focus on helping students with problems like dyslexia and autistic spectrum disorder in designated mainstream schools.&nbsp; This should help in further integration of the children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last few years, we have increased the administrative capabilities of the schools by introducing positions like Administration Managers and Operations Managers.&nbsp; They handle administrative and support functions at the school level.&nbsp; Currently, each school has about nine to 22 administrative posts, depending on their enrolment size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To coordinate the overall administrative support to schools, I am happy to announce that we will be introducing a new post called Vice Principal (Administration) or VP (Admin) position in schools.&nbsp; The VP (Admin) will be positioned to help the principal manage<p align=left>Column: 2204<p> resources strategically to drive excellence in administration as well as innovation at the school level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we provide more resources and autonomy to schools, as schools design various niche programmes for their pupils, as schools take active part in planning upgrading, we need to build up the planning capacity and capability of our schools.&nbsp; This will be one of the key challenges for the new VP (Admin).&nbsp; In addition, the VP (Admin) will also oversee all non-curriculum areas ranging from, eg, human resource management to estate management, quite a big job - literally, <I>pau sua, pau hai</I>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The VP (Admin) positions will be created based on justifiable demand.&nbsp; It is not that every school will automatically get a VP (Admin), because different schools have different needs.&nbsp; Schools with large student enrolment, good programmes and a large network of stakeholders will conceivably need a VP (Admin) more in order to ensure that resources are well-utilised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first few VP (Admin) will be assigned based on these general guidelines.&nbsp; VP (Admin) will be selected from our current pool of Executive and Administrative Staff as well as mid-career entrants.&nbsp; They will be appointed probably in June this year.&nbsp; The appointment will be part of the overall grooming process for talented individuals in MOE.&nbsp; To note, the VP (Admin) need not be an Education Officer, because his or her job is basically resource management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin Nordin said that the classroom has not changed since 1895.&nbsp; I will invite him to visit some of our schools. It appeared that whatever he saw in the classroom when he was in primary school had stayed in his mind.&nbsp; In fact, the school designs have changed quite a lot, and we have incorporated building specifications to ensure that new <p align=left>Column: 2205<p>demands and requirements are built in.&nbsp; In fact, it is because of the need to incorporate these new demands that we initiated this programme called PRIME - Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools.&nbsp; This is a $4.5 billion programme that was launched in 1999 to upgrade our schools.&nbsp; For example, Pasir Ris Primary had innovatively created resource corners in classrooms by constructing \u201cL-shape\ufffd? classrooms during PRIME.&nbsp; With this layout, it is possible to split a class into small groups to engage in different activities - you may even be able to run a small opera in the classroom.&nbsp; It is not like the old days where everybody sat in the middle, in rows or in circles, listening to the teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also pleased to announce that the Ministry of Education will be providing greater administrative flexibility for primary and secondary schools.&nbsp; This is part of our continuing efforts to give more resources to the schools.&nbsp; We are going to do this by freeing up 10-15% of the physical capacity in schools through adjustments to the planned enrolment.&nbsp; Each school will have the autonomy to decide how best to make use of the physical space thus created and freed up for their educational programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the planned enrolment will be reduced at the Primary 1 level in all Government primary schools from 2006, if possible.&nbsp; Government-aided schools will be given an option to adjust their enrolment, as reduction in enrolment will affect their respective communities, just in case they feel obliged to take in more students from their respective communities that they are serving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Ivan Png asked why is there a need to build bigger classrooms if the class size has been reduced.&nbsp; I just want to say that the class size was reduced only for Primary 1 and Primary 2.&nbsp; The Primary<p align=left>Column: 2206<p> 1 class this year was reduced from 40 to 30.&nbsp; The class size from Primary 3 onwards has not been reduced and therefore it is justifiable to build bigger classrooms as part of the PRIME requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong, Mr Iswaran, Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Ms Olsen spoke about special education, and some of the speeches were really passionate.&nbsp; First, I want to outline the framework for special education.&nbsp; In general, we have the Special Education (SPED) schools run by the voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs), because we believe that VWOs have got much greater passion in serving their respective case clients.&nbsp; What the Government does is to work hand in hand with them and give them support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPED schools cater to children with more severe disabilities.&nbsp; Those with mild disabilities and are able to cope and possible to be integrated, we will allow them to attend national schools.&nbsp; This approach acknowledges that different children have different needs, and it is better that we do something that is sensible for each of them.&nbsp; So some will go to SPED schools and some will go to our schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Olsen asked why not make it compulsory.&nbsp; There are some children who are really medically unfit to attend school.&nbsp; This number, however, is pretty small.&nbsp; We currently have 10 from the 2003 Primary 1 cohort and 12 from the 2004 Primary 1 cohort who have difficulty attending school because of their condition. If you look at the history of compulsory education, we actually introduced compulsory education pretty carefully.&nbsp; We legislated compulsory education when we had more or less achieved universal enrolment.&nbsp; In the case of special education, we are also not in a hurry.&nbsp; As we improve on the number of children with special needs attending the school, as we achieve near 100% enrolment, then<p align=left>Column: 2207<p> perhaps we will consider her proposal.&nbsp; But at the moment, it is more important for us to work towards enrolling as many of them as possible instead of considering legislative changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Education currently provides support to 20 special education schools that cater to about 4,500 children with different disabilities.&nbsp; Together with the National Council of Social Services, recurrent funding of up to four times the level of funding per primary student in mainstream schools is provided to SPED schools.&nbsp; Some may argue - why do we not give more?&nbsp; I just want to say that when I first joined the Ministry of Education, it was then only one time.&nbsp; Now, it is four times.&nbsp; So we have made progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Education has also increased its support for development costs of SPED school buildings from 90% to 95% of the project cost approved after September 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further enhance the support for SPED schools, the Prime Minister announced last year that we will be committing a total of $55 million a year till year 2008 for special needs in SPED and mainstream schools.&nbsp; The enhanced funding will really speed up the upgrading and redevelopment of SPED schools, so that more of them will be able to enjoy better facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than physical infrastructure, the additional funding will also go towards improving the quality of professional resources in SPED schools, eg, recruitment of better qualified teachers, providing better professional development for the staff as well as improving the curriculum design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with Mr Iswaran on the benefits of co-locating special and mainstream schools</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>so that the children can each study in their own school but<p align=left>Column: 2208<p> they have the opportunity to meet with each other.

For example, for children with sensory impairment, resource teachers are provided at six designated secondary schools to help their learning in schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 59 mainstream schools that have been retrofitted to facilitate access for children with physical disabilities. Children with sensory and physical disabilities are also provided with assistive devices to aid their learning.&nbsp; Children with dyslexia or autism in mainstream schools <p align=left>Column: 2209<p>also receive additional support from the Ministry of Education and the voluntary welfare organisations. As I mentioned earlier, we are recruiting additional staff to help them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, but not least, with effect from year 2006, the Ministry of Education will strengthen the support for children with learning disabilities by deploying Special Needs Officers to 20 designated primary schools and 30 secondary schools.&nbsp;

I am sure the teachers would be very happy.&nbsp; But I think it is still important for us to understand the nature of the workload of the teachers.&nbsp; So I would like to urge the Ministry to consider doing a review on the workload and maybe develop some kind of an indicator or index so that we can compare over time whether the workload has increased or decreased and also compare with other countries, so that we have a handle on the workload.&nbsp; Because teachers are not like managers, where they are on flexi hours and can adjust their own time.&nbsp; They are not like workers who have fixed hours, so long as you work 44 hours a week, you are all right.&nbsp;

It is a vocation.&nbsp; There are teachers who just want to go all the way, whatever review we have done.&nbsp; And they always will have a heavy workload.&nbsp; Sir, the ironical thing is that good teachers always have heavy<p align=left>Column: 2210<p> workload.&nbsp; It is just like good MPs always have heavy workload.&nbsp; There was a question to Mr Hawazi on why some parents prefer to go and see the MP, rather than the school.&nbsp; Maybe, it is because the MP is very popular.&nbsp; So we will have to see the workload in context.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Gan that there is a lot of intangible in a teacher's work and therefore no amount of survey can really give us a good feel of what it actually is.&nbsp; But providing additional administrative support by recruiting more teachers while we can, will be the things that we will continue to do.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But I was just wondering if the Ministry will consider extending compulsory education to children with perhaps physical disabilities through early intervention which will qualify them&nbsp;for mainstream schools, especially since now more resources are given to a number of mainstream schools to cater for children with disabilities, such as facilities and better trimming.&nbsp; I would not say medically unfit, but because of their physical disabilities, they can go to&nbsp;the mainstream schools, and whether&nbsp;compulsory education&nbsp;can be extended to this group of children.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Those children are not included in compulsory education because compulsory education only starts at Primary 1.&nbsp; If you are talking about children who are already in national schools, then why legislate?&nbsp; They are already in there.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, the most important issue is not whether the legislation includes them but whether we are able to make sure that all of them have the opportunity for appropriate education.&nbsp; There will be <p align=left>Column: 2211<p>some, because of special circumstances, whose parents may decide not to enrol them, let them stay at home, educate them at home, and so on.&nbsp; We probably would have to respect that, rather than force the issue through legislation.&nbsp; If it is legislated, and if the parents do not send the kid to school, they have committed an offence.&nbsp; But if, on the other hand, the voluntary welfare organisations are able to get to these children who are at home and offer them help, and maybe the Community Development Councils also join in and assist, that may be the best arrangement for the family. So let us look at the effect of all these combined efforts, rather than looking at the legislation alone.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Iswaran:</B> Sir, the Ministry agrees that it is a good idea to have special schools and mainstream schools co-located, and I was pleased to hear about the three examples.&nbsp; Can I ask whether these three co-location examples occurred by&nbsp;certain liberty or was it because of planning and intent on the part of the Ministry and the parties involved?&nbsp; It is a very important point to address because it seems to me it is more likely to be the case as it happens perchance and because it is Canossian School, maybe the school initiated the idea. If the Ministry sees about it, then in the planning exercise for new schools and also as part of the&nbsp;PRIME programme, there should be a specific targeting and including it&nbsp;in site planning, and so on.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;we all know that there are site norms,&nbsp;you have to negotiate with URA for schools, and if you are going to co-locate schools, you need to make additional provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate some clarifications on that.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Firstly, to take advantage of the flexibility arising from the corporatisation, the universities must identify areas where it has the potential to develop peaks of excellence and put in place a clear strategy to develop these areas.&nbsp; So I would like to ask the Minister whether he will share with us which particular areas have these universities identified as potential growth areas.&nbsp; Secondly, very often, the success of a good strategy depends on the people behind it.&nbsp; It is therefore crucial for the universities to have the right people who have the vision, the ability and the determination to lead the universities and take them to greater heights.&nbsp; Could the Minister tell us whether he thinks the present leadership at the two universities&nbsp;is appropriate and whether there is a need to strengthen it?&nbsp; Thirdly, the corporatisation will also give the universities flexibility in setting their&nbsp;fees.&nbsp; This may translate into higher costs&nbsp;for the undergraduates,&nbsp;maybe in certain faculties at least.&nbsp;Will the Minister assure the House that corporatisation by itself should not lead to higher fees?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2213<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related subject, the Minister announced last year that the Government will gradually reduce its subsidy for university students over time.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Government to recover this move as it is in Singapore's interest to help our children maximise their potential and to pursue their tertiary education here.&nbsp; Given that universities can now go out to raise funds, could the Government consider reducing the subsidy only after the universities are able to raise sufficient funds to fill the gap?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I am a Council Member of the Nanyang Technological University.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support this move to make the universities more autonomous by way of corporatisation.&nbsp; And I think that this move will be in the long-term interest of Singapore.&nbsp; To be successful, I have a similar concern, like Mr Gan Kim Yong, and that is the management structure.&nbsp; For this to work successfully, we probably would need to think of two parallel structures in the university.&nbsp; One, the management structure, run almost like a corporate, a CEO management type of skills.&nbsp; And the second, an academic type of structure.&nbsp; These two need to be run in parallel.&nbsp; I ask the Minister whether these have been taken into consideration and, if so, whether we are going to make some changes in the management structure in the universities before we make this move.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I am not so sure whether the problem of corporatisation and the&nbsp;related problems within the universities will arise because the universities are not able to handle this move, but more because of MOE's inability to let go and whether the problem will remain with MOE who wants<p align=left>Column: 2214<p> to still exercise control and still expect the universities to move fast enough.&nbsp; This is another issue that needs to be thoroughly studied before we decide to go and corporatise the universities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final issue I worry about is how we are going to handle the corporatisation of the three universities. All three of our universities, NUS, NTU and SMU, have different backgrounds.&nbsp; First of all, NUS is long established.&nbsp; It has a very long history and a very strong base of alumni who are able to support the university by way of funding or to become council members who can help manage the university.&nbsp; Therefore, its risks for corporatisation, I believe, are low.&nbsp; Second, SMU.&nbsp; It is a new university.&nbsp; It started on&nbsp;the basis of being quite autonomous and the management structure and how it has developed itself has been almost the model that we want for the rest of the universities.&nbsp; So, again, I think for SMU, the risks are similarly low.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, on the other hand, NTU has a short history.&nbsp; If you look at the modern NTU, not counting Nanyang University, there are only 20 batches of alumni, or&nbsp;graduates, and I happened to be from the first batch.&nbsp; The earlier batches were only very small numbers - 600 in my batch - and it started to grow.&nbsp; So we have&nbsp;a relatively less established alumni base.&nbsp; Secondly, it is only now that NTU is trying to transform itself from a technological university to a comprehensive university.&nbsp; So I see this as a second major risk for NTU as it tries to make this move.&nbsp; I, therefore, ask the Minister to take this into consideration, particularly when it comes to the&nbsp;allocation of resources, whether it is funding or the type of people to support the changes.&nbsp; And, among all the three universities, NTU faces the greatest risk with this change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</B> Sir, the move to corporatise our local universities, NUS and NTU, is a highly commendable decision.&nbsp; That this decision&nbsp;reportedly took three years to make across the tenure of two&nbsp;Ministers reflects the fact that the issues are highly complex.&nbsp; From a conceptual viewpoint, nobody can argue against the benefits of university autonomy.&nbsp; But, as in so many Government policies, there can be a darker side to this decision, and&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to give due consideration to some practical problems that may arise from the corporatisation.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, while competition is good, the focus should be beyond, rather than within, our shores.&nbsp; All three universities, NUS, NTU as well as SMU, offer popular courses like business administration, with each of them trying hard to differentiate from the others to attract the best student brains.&nbsp; This competition makes for a more varied landscape, and certainly interesting newspaper and bus-stop advertisements.&nbsp; But our small size makes me wonder if such competition is more confusing and destructive than helpful, and also wasteful of already scarce funds.&nbsp; Might it not be better for these universities to each develop into more specialised schools that offer breadth and depth in both research and teaching?&nbsp; So, it is a managed autonomy that we are talking about, rather than a free-for-all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another obvious concern is further future fee hikes.&nbsp; The recent fee hikes by all three universities might well be viewed as a herald of things to come.&nbsp; This is the unavoidable conclusion of a sceptical public.&nbsp; This fear is accentuated by the Government stating very clearly that it <p align=left>Column: 2216<p>intends to reduce the 75% subsidy to university students.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to ensure, as in the case of overseas colleges, that there will be enough scholarships, grants, loans and part-time jobs available on campus to help students pay their fees, so that no deserving student will be deprived of a university education due to financial circumstances.&nbsp; The universities, like their US counterparts, could evaluate how much fees a student can contribute, based on his family circumstances, before looking at a combination of university-funded scholarships, grants, loans and part-time work to help him pay his fees.&nbsp; They should not impose a one-size-fits-all means test, as this could mean that those from the sandwich class could be left out in the cold, in terms of financial assistance.&nbsp; The drop in funding will need to be compensated, as in other privately-run universities elsewhere, by the greater involvement&nbsp;of their alumni in fund-raising.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the road to autonomy is going to be strewn with sensitive staff issues.&nbsp; As the university reviews its hiring and tenure policy to attract and keep the best talents, inevitably there will be casualties.&nbsp; I hope that the transition will be handled with sensitivity, especially the older staff whose efforts and contributions had made the universities what they are now.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, the preliminary report of the steering committee to review university autonomy, governance and funding released by MOE recently stated that the Government will shift its funding model for university by 2006.&nbsp; Instead of funding operating expenditure based on the number of students enrolled, funding will be based on the number of graduates produced.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2217<p> According to the report, the general rationale is to enhance the competitiveness of our three public-funded universities.&nbsp; The change will also encourage universities to meet national manpower targets and the Government will be able to predetermine the number of graduates when it provides its funding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the new system, it would be up to the universities to decide the numbers and profiles of the students it should enrol, so as to produce the required number of graduates three or four years down the road.&nbsp; Universities which&nbsp;do not meet output targets will have to refund MOE the money based on a certain formula.&nbsp; Such a funding model will also force universities to look at alternative sources of funding, such as soliciting donations and enrolling full-fee paying foreign students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do agree that whenever public funds are used, we should have some measure of accountability and some ways of measuring whether the funds&nbsp;meet our national objectives.&nbsp; However, the question is whether it is in the national interest to fund operating expenditures of universities based on graduate numbers.&nbsp; If graduate numbers determine the level of funding received, a university will face pressures to graduate a high percentage of the intake.&nbsp; This could manifest itself in the lowering of academic standards.&nbsp; For example, in order for a university management to do financial planning, it will probably set graduate targets for individual faculties to achieve, to ensure that it can obtain a certain amount of funding from MOE.&nbsp; Academic staff will then face pressures to pass students and face intense scrutiny for failing students.&nbsp; Their bargaining power with the students will be weakened.&nbsp; After all, how many students can a professor fail.&nbsp; Once a student knows that this is a numbers game, they need not try too hard.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2218<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the same report, Sir, MOE intends to increase the university cohort participation rate from 21% from each Primary 1 cohort to 25% by 2010.&nbsp; Assuming that the average intelligence of each cohort is constant over the years, what this means is that the cut-off point for entry into university will be lower, since more students in each cohort are to be admitted into university.&nbsp; If the universities are to enrol weaker students and yet are to be funded based on the number who graduate, the threat to maintaining standards becomes clear.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another concern is that stricter rules will probably be implemented on&nbsp;the maximum&nbsp;candidature of&nbsp;our students.&nbsp; There may even be rules to remove&nbsp;a student after&nbsp;the first year when he fails so that he does not remain in the system for too long.&nbsp; This will inevitably put&nbsp;much pressure on university students.&nbsp; We should bear in&nbsp;mind that someone who manages&nbsp;to get a degree with a longer duration can still contribute much to society, even though the system sees him as not cost-efficient.&nbsp; Will the new funding model force such students out of&nbsp;tertiary education prematurely?&nbsp; I understand that in some European countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands, funding of tertiary institutions is based on a mix of input and output targets.&nbsp; While they accept that tertiary institutions must be performance-driven, they also recognise that there are dangers in over-reliance on output targets.&nbsp; Hence, these countries fund their education institutions based on a mix of input and output targets, based on both the number of first-year students enrolled and the number of graduates produced.&nbsp; Why is the Ministry not considering a mix of input and output targets?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, using graduate numbers as a primary measure to fund universities is a drastic change which leads us to conclude that all that matters to this Government is <p align=left>Column: 2219<p>students getting that piece of paper.&nbsp; Is that the only one value of education?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp;

Prof. Ong Soh Khim</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp; Sir, I must, first of all, declare my interest as I am presently an Associate Professor at NUS.&nbsp; The announcement made by the three universities that they are planning to raise their tuition fees from 5% to 15% may appear to be a simple \u201cinflation\ufffd? problem.&nbsp; However, the students and parents have quite varied opinions on this issue.&nbsp; I would like to raise a few points.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Both the universities and MOE believe that by raising tuition fees, they will have more funds to hire high-calibre professors and improve the basic infrastructure of the universities.&nbsp; This would also imply that both teaching and curriculum qualities will be raised.&nbsp; This sounds rather commercial and conveys the meaning of \u201cyou pay for what you buy\ufffd?.&nbsp; Do higher tuition fees equate to better universities?&nbsp; Are we treating public universities like profit-oriented institutions?&nbsp; Are we commercialising the education process and making university education a privilege of the rich?&nbsp; Universities have the responsibility to train talents and professionals for the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; One of the reasons for the tuition fee hike is to provide more funds in hiring overseas \u201cgurus\ufffd?, ie, renowned scientists and research professors to enhance the quality of teaching.&nbsp; However, are these famous researchers and scientists equally keen on teaching?&nbsp; Outstanding researchers and scientists do not necessarily equate to quality teachers and they may not be able to raise the quality of undergraduate teaching.&nbsp; We need to be cautious as universities should not spend big bucks in hiring renowned overseas<p align=left>Column: 2220<p> professors for conducting blue-sky research alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Universities mentioned that they would be providing more scholarships, loans, bursaries and financial assistance schemes, as well as increasing \u201cstudy while you work\ufffd? opportunities to ensure that no qualified students will be denied entrance due to financial constraints.&nbsp; Loans are akin to two pockets:&nbsp; take away money from the right&nbsp;pocket and deposit some money into the left pocket. Unfortunately, money taken away is real, and the deposit is a loan.&nbsp; Every student will be debt-ridden upon graduation. Finally who benefits?&nbsp; This is none other than the commercial banks which arrange the loans for the students! Eligibility of bursaries and study loans depends on the combined income of a household.&nbsp; However, the combined income does not represent the true affordability as the older siblings in the family could all be paying back their study loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, many students could be denied of their financial assistance.&nbsp; Statistics also show that many students apply to use their parents' CPF to pay for the tuition fees.&nbsp; Due to the lowering of the salary ceiling of CPF, the parents' accounts are heavily laden with a myriad&nbsp;of payment items, such as the increased MediShield premium, housing loan and tuition fee loan.&nbsp; It is also doubtful that by providing students with part-time working opportunities, whether it helps the students financially, or&nbsp;weighs them down in their studies.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Presently, overseas students only pay 10% more tuition fees compared to local students, equivalent to $590 per year.&nbsp; This is much lower than the full fees paid by the overseas students in the UK, Australia and other universities overseas.&nbsp; Although overseas students have to fulfill a service agreement to work in Singapore for three years after their graduation, this has become a \"non-issue\" due to Singapore's rapid economic growth and<p align=left>Column: 2221<p> attractive salary since most of the foreign students are more than happy to stay back and work here.&nbsp; Moreover, many overseas students can well afford to pay full fees.&nbsp; I would like to urge the MOE to consider raising the fees paid by the overseas students.&nbsp; This can be done over a period of time so that the subsidy provided by MOE, which is currently $12,830,&nbsp;can be reduced.&nbsp; The savings can be used to help the local students and reduce the amount of fees they need to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Presently, MOE also subsidises the tuition fees of graduate students.&nbsp; Both research and coursework graduate students are subsidised by the MOE.&nbsp; Among the graduate students, especially the coursework Masters' students, most of them have full-time jobs, in other words, they have fixed monthly income compared to full-time undergraduates.&nbsp; These graduate students can surely afford to pay higher tuition fees.&nbsp; I would like to urge the MOE to consider raising the fees paid by the coursework Masters' students, again in stages, for reducing the subsidy provided by MOE.&nbsp; The savings can be utilised in subsidising the fees paid by the local undergraduate students.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; Parents and students have some doubts concerning the fee hike by the universities, eg, what is the specific use of the increased fee.&nbsp; After the fee hike, is there any guarantee that the quality of teaching will go up?&nbsp; If the universities wish to convince the public, there must be an increased amount of transparency.&nbsp; The financial figures of the universities have to be made transparent and more open, so that the students and parents can know the specific use of their fees and understand the financial status of the universities, the ways funds are being deployed, and how the MOE subsidy is being utilised, in order to brush aside any doubts they may have.&nbsp; It will also be<p align=left>Column: 2222<p> useful for the university to meet with the students and ask for their opinions for any major policy changes which may affect them directly. This will enable better decisions to be made by the universities.&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7)&nbsp; MOE announced in January this year that both NUS and NTU will be corporatised and become non-profit companies.&nbsp; After corporatisation, both universities should have the freedom in deciding their own fee structure.&nbsp; SMU announced in January that their undergraduate tuition fees will be increased by 15% this August.&nbsp; Why is SMU immediately increasing their tuition fees by 15%?&nbsp; The main reason could be that SMU is already a corporatised university.&nbsp; After the corporatisation of NUS and NTU, the most concerned question is whether they are also going to raise their fees by 15%.&nbsp; MOE mentioned that after the corporatisation of these two universities, they would have the liberty to increase their fees yearly, but capped at 10% over the previous year's fees.&nbsp; However, even with this capping at below 10%, for example, the universities can increase the fees at 9% each year, after four to five years, according to geometric progression, the final fee increase is still very significant.&nbsp; I hope that MOE&nbsp;could scale down the percentage of the fee hike allowed, and stipulate this clearly in the Policy and Performance Agreement to be signed with the universities, for avoiding the freedom of fee hike and increase the burden of the undergraduates.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; The Government could consider establishing an \u201cEducation Bank\ufffd?, akin to an industrial bank, dedicated to take care of the financial matters related to education, particularly the educational loans.&nbsp; This could prevent the commercial banks from taking the resources from education, and allow the education funds to be contained within the education system.&nbsp; The Government could also help to diversify the sources of funding for the universities through encouraging dona<p align=left>Column: 2223<p>tions from the business sectors, and establishing tax deduction incentives for such donations made.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, there are only three universities in Singapore.&nbsp; Unlike in the US, Australia and other countries where there are many public and private universities, our students are left with very few choices.&nbsp; It is very costly to attend universities overseas.&nbsp; The amount of tuition fees we pay is relative to the income of the citizens.&nbsp; We should not allow the fees charged by the universities to reach a stage that few students and parents can afford.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:&nbsp;</B> Sir, as Singapore progresses towards being a leading city in the knowledge-based economy, in Asia and in the world, our universities will have to play a larger role, in two regards.&nbsp; First, they will have to provide a high-quality education for Singaporeans and foreign students who attend the universities, but principally for Singaporean students.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>Second,&nbsp;they will&nbsp;have to excel in research so as to be able to create knowledge and wealth for Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to achieve this, we need to re-orient the universities and establish a new relationship between the universities and Government, between the universities and their alumni, and within the universities, between&nbsp;faculty and the students of the university itself.&nbsp; A whole new set of external and internal corporate governance relationships needs&nbsp;to be established. We have to re-orient the universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April last year, we initiated the University Autonomy, Governance and Funding (UAGF) review.&nbsp; The preliminary recommendations were released in January this year and discussed extensively by the Ministry of Education's International Academic Advisory Panel - <p align=left>Column: 2224<p>which Dr Ng Eng Hen happens to chair. It strongly endorsed the move to transform our universities into autonomous universities to enable them to achieve teaching and research excellence, raise their international standing and enhance their students' educational experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that Mr Inderjit Singh, who is a member of the NTU Council, feels that the move towards autonomy is the right one for the universities and that he is excited by it, even&nbsp;if a little apprehensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the proposal to change the legal status of NUS and NTU into not-for-profit corporations is to engender a mindset change among the university community at large, to encourage them to take greater ownership of the university, and to shape its future direction,&nbsp;culture and&nbsp;character.&nbsp; This is an excellent opportunity for greater civic participation in the ownership and running of&nbsp;key national&nbsp;institutions - our universities.&nbsp; Corporatisation will signal that the university belongs to its stakeholders&nbsp;- the university management, faculty, staff, students and the alumni - and not to the Government alone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree with Mr Gan Kim Yong that&nbsp;a critical success factor for autonomous universities is people, principally the university Council members, key management, faculty and staff.&nbsp; As with the autonomous&nbsp;universities in other countries, the university Councils will have to assume greater responsibility to provide oversight&nbsp;of the&nbsp;strategic direction for the universities, and ensure the proper use and accountability for their resources. Council members should be appointed based on competency and ability to contribute to the mission of the university.&nbsp; Universities will also have to enhance their governance structures and processes involving the Council, university management and faculty, given that decision-making will shift from the Ministry of Education to the autonomous<p align=left>Column: 2225<p> universities. Council members in successful autonomous universities abroad invest a considerable amount of time to help the universities achieve excellence.&nbsp; We are fortunate that our university Councils have capable and passionate people,&nbsp; and my interaction with the university Councils tells me that they warmly welcome the move towards greater autonomy and they also recognise their expanded roles and additional responsibilities. The Councils in particular will have to play a more significant role in charting the direction, optimising resources and ensuring the long-term financial sustainability of their institutions to support their pursuit of excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan asked if the present leadership of our universities is appropriate and whether there is a need to strengthen them.&nbsp; I am confident that the teams that we have in place - key management and the Council members -&nbsp;are&nbsp;strong teams,&nbsp;in the case of both NUS and NTU. SMU is a private university.&nbsp; It has been autonomous from the outset.&nbsp;But&nbsp;I should add that it is important not to look at the universities through the prism of corporate organisational models.&nbsp;If you look at the top American private and&nbsp;autonomous state universities, their organisational structure is a bit of an enigma. They defy the established tenets of management science. They have&nbsp;loosely coupled structures,&nbsp;highly collegial, sometimes not even clear who is in charge.&nbsp; This looseness and collegiality extends all the way from the top right down to the basic unit of the university, ie, the department within a faculty. The department is not the property or the domain of a senior professor, as it would be in Japan, Germany,&nbsp;Russia, or&nbsp;most European countries.&nbsp; It is, in fact,&nbsp;an alliance of broadly equal members, an alliance of more or less equal colleagues, taking ownership over how the department operates and the goals that it should<p align=left>Column: 2226<p> achieve. This very flexibility of the top American universities is what gives them their entrepreneurial spirit and is what has distinguished them from European and most Asian universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack&nbsp;of rigidity that comes from traditional academic hierarchies leads to&nbsp;constant striving, constant bubbling up of ideas to the surface. And attracting young minds. They do not need to wait 30 years to be recognised because in five years, if they are doing well and have the science, they can be recognised immediately.&nbsp; It is a different structure, different incentives, but, most important, a different culture, a culture of excellence based on merit. This is what NUS and NTU will have to strive towards and evolve towards, changing not just the external relationships with Government, but the internal culture of the university.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan also asked about the strategic plans of the universities -&nbsp;how will they become world-class and how will they take advantage of their autonomous status.&nbsp; Such plans take time to formulate.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were running&nbsp;a university, I would not want to rush it.&nbsp; It requires a thorough review, involving extensive consultations with different segments of the university community. I understand that both NUS and NTU have started a fresh round of strategic review and detailed plans will unfold in due course.&nbsp; But even now, we can see how the universities are starting to differentiate themselves in their pursuit for excellence.&nbsp; NUS, in seeking to develop a community of students with cross-culture exposure, is investing in developing extensive linkages with top overseas universities and establishing more overseas colleges.&nbsp; It is also offering&nbsp;its undergraduates more cross-faculty and specialised modules.&nbsp; It is developing in&nbsp;pioneering ways&nbsp;at the post-graduate level, inter-disciplinary courses and research combining medicine, engineering and the natural sciences.&nbsp; NTU, too, is looking at providing students with global immersion opportunities in China and <p align=left>Column: 2227<p>India, raising an entrepreneurial flag and wanting to provide students with a unique residential educational experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NUS and NTU are key academic institutions in Singapore. They perform a critical supporting role to our economy, both in producing top quality graduates as well as in contributing to Singapore's vibrant research landscape. They are large, complex institutions offering a broad range of disciplines, and, in the case of NTU, becoming broader as it&nbsp;becomes a comprehensive university. They would need time to change. Change cannot be rushed. So the devolution of autonomy and corporatisation will be a gradual process to ensure that the quality of our universities will continue to be enhanced and the needs of the public and the economy will continue to be met.&nbsp;&nbsp;But our experience with SMU,&nbsp;albeit&nbsp;a much smaller younger university, gives us confidence that the proposed model of governance will work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me address some of the concerns about education outcomes. Dr Amy Khor asked about measures to ensure that.&nbsp; Ultimately, the students are given good teaching.&nbsp; Prof. Ong Soh Khim likewise has said that it would not be wise for the universities to spend big bucks to attract highly renowned overseas professors who only&nbsp;do research.&nbsp; I agree that we need good faculty who would&nbsp;not only do top-notch research but&nbsp;are also keen to teach, interact with and excite students, so that our universities can maintain a high quality of teaching and produce graduates of good calibre.&nbsp;This is, in fact, what we see in reputable overseas universities where senior professors are committed to both teaching and research, with different balance in the case of different professors.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at a university like MIT, for instance, in fact, MIT is not renowned to be number one in research.&nbsp; If you look at the number of publications and scientific journals and various other measures, it is not the number one.&nbsp; But it is highly reputed for its teaching. So they<p align=left>Column: 2228<p> have got&nbsp;top-rate minds doing top-rate research and top-rate teaching.&nbsp; They are known for that.&nbsp; Just compare MIT with a European university, state-owned, low fees, traditional structures -&nbsp;the difference is there, not just in research but in teaching.&nbsp; And students who pay high fees to get into MIT demand the highest quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also recognise&nbsp;the very important point that when we attract top faculty, we are not just attracting top faculty,&nbsp;we are starting a virtuous cycle. Top faculty begets top&nbsp;junior faculty,&nbsp;and begets top students.&nbsp; And that becomes a virtuous cycle.&nbsp; It attracts more people who want to work with bright young students, attracts post-doctorates, who in turn provide the base for new top faculty to come in. They feed on themselves, reputation goes up, our students benefit.&nbsp;I am glad that performance in teaching is an essential component of the way both NUS and NTU assess their faculty, which is&nbsp;part of their annual appraisal process.&nbsp; I should also add&nbsp;that the universities' spending on research does not come at the expense of teaching. They receive the bulk of their research funding from A*STAR, the National Medical Research Council, the industry and other external sources, and&nbsp;this is&nbsp;over and above&nbsp;MOE's grants to the universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked a very interesting question - whether funding based on the graduate output formula will compel the universities to pass students at the expense of quality.&nbsp; It is an analytically valid question, but I would not be unduly worried if I were Mr Low.&nbsp; MOE's funding to the universities has catered for attrition that the universities have experienced in past years, so universities will not&nbsp;feel compelled to lower their passing&nbsp;standards for funding reasons.&nbsp; More importantly, I am sure that the universities are fully aware that they have to maintain student quality so as to <p align=left>Column: 2229<p>safeguard their institutional reputations. Their alumni, faculty and their stakeholders&nbsp;would hold them to it.&nbsp; He raised the example of Sweden and some other European countries.&nbsp; It is rather different there.&nbsp; In those countries, the universities are obliged by governments to take in massive numbers of students. As long as they pass their High School examinations,&nbsp;it does not matter whether the student is weak or barely able&nbsp;to cope with the university education,&nbsp;he has a right to a place.&nbsp; So what happens&nbsp;in those universities?&nbsp; The first year cohort is enormous and, at the end of the first year, you have what they fondly call the \"chain saw massacre\" - where examinations are set, students fail, and out they go.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you fund these universities only by an output model, you are not doing them justice for this massive cost they&nbsp;have to incur on teaching large lecture halls full of unshaven students.&nbsp; So you have got to have some components or a formula that factors in inputs as well.&nbsp;It is a peculiar institutional feature and not one that is directly relevant to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also raised an interesting point about cohort participation going up to 25%. Are we sure we are not going to&nbsp;be letting standards go down?&nbsp; I think it is a right question to ask.&nbsp; The answer to that is that&nbsp;standards have been going up in our schools, in our JCs, and in our polytechnics.&nbsp; In fact, standards of cohorts exiting our secondary schools, JCs and polytechnics now, are far higher than they were even&nbsp;eight or 10 years ago.&nbsp; Our students are better-trained, they are sharper on the job, and&nbsp;they are better able to cope with&nbsp;a university education.&nbsp; It is a recognition of that upward drift in quality, that the universities have decided to take in more students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now address the issue of funding.&nbsp; Let me just say that in the past,<p align=left>Column: 2230<p> the Government had paid 75% of the operating cost of undergraduate education and borne in full the infrastructure cost of our universities.&nbsp; Last year,&nbsp;the Minister for Finance, in his Budget speech, signalled that, \"Going forward, we need to establish a&nbsp;more equitable and sustainable cost-sharing formula between the state and university students.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has now decided that over the medium term, it will move towards funding 75% of the total cost of undergraduate education, ie, including both operating and depreciation costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me provide a perspective from the point of view of the Education budget as to why this is very sensible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the budget for the university sector is about&nbsp; a quarter of MOE's budget. At 1% of GDP, MOE's funding for the university sector is&nbsp;slightly higher than some OECD countries like the US, UK and Australia.&nbsp; It may surprise some, but it is, in fact, a higher ratio. With strong funding support from the Government, our universities' finances have remained healthy, unlike many overseas universities, such as those in the UK, half of which are estimated to be in the&nbsp;red largely because state funding is spread too thinly across&nbsp;a cohort participation rate of 40% in the universities.&nbsp; Even Cambridge has been suffering a deficit in recent years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh expressed some concern that NTU faces the greatest risk in the move to make universities more autonomous as it has just gotten used to operating as a fully-fledged university.&nbsp; He asked if MOE will consider this disadvantage when we allocate budgets and resources to NTU.&nbsp; Again, I&nbsp;would not be worried.&nbsp; I would like to reassure Mr Inderjit Singh that the universities will continue to receive substantial Government funding and I am optimistic that NTU will be able to build on its very strong&nbsp;&nbsp;present&nbsp; foundations to chart its<p align=left>Column: 2231<p> own path into the future. The funding formula will not disadvantage NTU.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>6.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs in the university, however, will go&nbsp;up for a number of reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, enrolment is going up.&nbsp; And so naturally, as we move from 21% to 25% cohort participation, the total cost of university education in the Education budget will go up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, it is a global phenomenon that the cost of higher education increases faster than general inflation.&nbsp; In the US, for example, the average cost of higher education increased by 12% between 2001&nbsp;and 2004, whereas the Consumer Price Index only increased by 6%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the universities need a continuous injection of funds to maintain a high quality of teaching and research that Singapore&nbsp;and our students deserve.&nbsp; Manpower costs account for the bulk of universities' costs, and our universities need to be able to pay competitive salaries in order to retain and recruit top faculty from around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will not be able to increase the amount of funding to the university sector indefinitely, without impacting on other education sectors: our polytechnics, ITE and&nbsp;schools.&nbsp;In that context, I should point out that university students already enjoy a much higher dollar subsidy from Government compared to&nbsp;other students.&nbsp; If one were to take the last fiscal year for computation, the subsidy per year which a university undergraduate received was twice that of a polytechnic or ITE student,&nbsp;three times that of a secondary school student and&nbsp;five times that of a primary school student.&nbsp; Moreover, a university student is subsidised for more years of education, compared to students in polytechnics and ITE.&nbsp; After two years in junior college and four years in university, <p align=left>Column: 2232<p> would have enjoyed five times more subsidies than an ITE student would have in his two years of post-secondary education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take that, plus the fact that the benefits of a university education accrue mainly to the graduate. The graduates from the universities will earn over their lifetime more than polytechnic and ITE graduates, on average, and you&nbsp;realise&nbsp;that it is more reasonable, quite apart from being a more sustainable arrangement, for university students to contribute&nbsp;towards the development cost of universities as well, since they enjoy the use of the universities' facilities during their period of study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also add that 75% funding by the Government is very high, compared to the level of state funding for top universities in the US, UK and Australia.&nbsp; We intend to maintain it at 75%, even after our universities become more autonomous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universities, at the same time, are encouraged to diversify their sources of revenue, even as we remain committed to being the major source of funding for the universities.&nbsp; The generous donations received, in the recent past, for the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music, the donation from Ng Bok Eng's family to NTU, the Lee Foundation's donation to SMU, all show that financial support from university stakeholders could go a long way towards the successful launch of some of our universities' major initiatives.&nbsp; Corporatisation and autonomy offer tremendous opportunities for our universities to generate even stronger&nbsp; ownership and support from their alumni and stakeholders, including private benefactors and corporations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will remain generous in co-funding donations that the universities receive for endowments.&nbsp; In <p align=left>Column: 2233<p>fact, it is almost unheard of internationally.&nbsp; When our International Advisory Panel heard about it, they could not believe that we fund one-for-one.&nbsp; In fact, the universities have received&nbsp;more than one-for-one matching for certain large donations.&nbsp;I should add that our donors to the universities, whether individuals or corporations, also enjoy double tax deductions.&nbsp; I think this answers one of Prof. Ong Soh Khim's points.&nbsp; In the latest Budget, PM Lee had announced that double tax deduction will be granted for all donations to Institutions of&nbsp;Public Character (IPCs), whether or not they involve naming opportunities.&nbsp; This, again, would advantage the universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another source of funds is derived through the greater financial autonomy that is given to the universities.&nbsp; Through the one-line block budget the universities will receive for recurrent and development expenditure put together, the universities will have greater flexibility to deploy their resources and make trade-off decisions, for instance, between expenditure on faculty and infrastructure.&nbsp; This will help generate cost consciousness and instil cost discipline.&nbsp; It is then up to each university to decide internally how the funds should be disbursed to the various faculties and programmes to best achieve their objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the matter of fees, and the recent fee increases.&nbsp; I agree with&nbsp;Prof. Ong Soh Khim that we should explore the issue of the fees that should be charged to foreign students.&nbsp; There might be different types of fees for different types of students - whether they come in as scholars or on their own&nbsp;free basis.&nbsp; These are things that could be worked out.&nbsp; But it is a valid issue to be explored.&nbsp; I would add that in setting fees for foreign students, we should take into consideration the larger strategic objectives for the universities and<p align=left>Column: 2234<p> Singapore.&nbsp; Foreign students add to the vibrancy of the learning environment in the universities, just like as we discussed this afternoon they add to the vibrancy of our schools.&nbsp; They provide a certain&nbsp; diversity, a different perspective, and they add ultimately to the international standing of our universities when put together with Singapore students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMU's increase of 15% is not simply because it is a corporatised university.&nbsp; SMU is repositioning itself.&nbsp; It is adopting a different business model, a seminar-style pedagogy with very low student-to-teacher ratios, and is moving into large new facilities later this year.&nbsp; So the fee increase, in the case of SMU, is due to a fundamentally different type of university that it wants to run, rather than the mere fact of it being corporatised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, NUS and NTU will be given greater autonomy to set their own tuition fees, and to differentiate fees for different courses.&nbsp; But I would mention a few things.&nbsp; First, the Government will remain the major source of funding to the universities.&nbsp; Second, we have put in place systems to encourage and incentivise our universities to diversify and generate additional sources of revenues.&nbsp; Third, under the enhanced accountability framework, MOE will monitor the universities' costs closely and ensure that&nbsp;their costs are well managed.&nbsp; Fourth, there will also be a 10% cap on annual tuition fee increases for NUS and NTU.&nbsp; The 10% cap does not mean 10% per annum.&nbsp; It means anything from \"0\" to \"10\".&nbsp; I have no reason to expect that the universities will raise fees by 10% per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, our universities are well aware that they need to justify the need for any future fee increases, which would have to be commensurate with improvements in the quality of the education they provide.&nbsp; They also understand the importance of<p align=left>Column: 2235<p> communication with students on any fee increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would encourage our universities to adopt the practice at many good US universities to make known to students, at the outset, the schedule of tuition fees they might expect during their course of study.&nbsp; This will help students and their families do their financial planning for the costs of their university education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me speak very briefly about the tuition fee loan scheme.&nbsp; It currently allows students to borrow up to 80% of their tuition fees and start repaying their loans only upon graduation.&nbsp; The loan is funded by the Government, not by the banks.&nbsp; It is all Government money but is administered by the banks.&nbsp; I think it is not so dissimilar in concept to the \u201cEducation Bank\ufffd? that Prof. Ong Soh Khim described.&nbsp; MOE will increase the loan quantum of the tuition fee loan from 80% to 90% so that students can defer the payment of any increase in tuition fees until after they graduate.&nbsp; MOE is also working with the universities to study how we could further enhance the existing schemes, such as expanding students' work-study schemes at the universities, and setting up of student financing offices to better customise financing packages to individual needs.&nbsp;The specific example&nbsp;Prof. Ong gave of a family that might not qualify under&nbsp;the current means-based rule. &nbsp;These are things that could be looked at by the student financing offices.&nbsp; They could be customised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also agree with Prof. Ong that universities should raise the fees for coursework Masters' students since most of them have full-time jobs and fixed monthly income.&nbsp; This is sensible and was, in fact, proposed as part of the University Autonomy, Governance and Funding (UAGF) review.&nbsp; The change should, however, be phased in so that universities have sufficient time to make the necessary adjustments to tuition fees and manpower deployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 2236<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude that our universities have made significant progress.&nbsp; They have reached the stage of development where they are poised to join the league of the best universities in the world.&nbsp; With greater autonomy, our universities will be able to better respond to the needs of their students and stakeholders, better differentiate themselves in the increasingly competitive higher education landscape and achieve the peaks of excellence, by global standards, that the universities and Singapore need.&nbsp; Our universities will be able to build upon the strong support from the Government to continue to maintain and attract good faculty and offer students quality education, with greater flexibility and choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am confident that giving autonomy to our universities will strategically position our universities to underpin Singapore's transition to a knowledge-based economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The second issue is with regard to the Minister's comment that university education benefits more the individual.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether he will agree that tertiary education does produce good government, business and community leaders, which benefit not only individuals, but the community as a <p align=left>Column: 2237<p>whole.&nbsp; Perhaps we just have to agree or disagree on this point since it is a more philosophical matter.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> I would say that it will take time for any university to change its culture, precisely because it does not just simply hire a CEO who&nbsp;cuts, hires and changes people.&nbsp; Universities have to evolve.&nbsp; Faculties&nbsp;have to deal with each other with a certain respect and collegiality.&nbsp; There is a plus in some circumstances and minus in&nbsp;other circumstances.&nbsp; But we have to let the culture evolve.&nbsp; They&nbsp;are&nbsp;still&nbsp;young institutions.&nbsp; I do not think they are anything near as rigid as most other Asian universities or European universities.&nbsp; They have a much larger pool of diverse faculty.&nbsp; Singaporeans&nbsp;trained in different universities, and foreigners coming in from various countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rigidities are less institutionalised and less deeply-rooted.&nbsp; So I am optimistic.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;his second point, I would not make too much of a point about whether individuals internalise most of the benefits,&nbsp;university graduates internalise most of the benefits, or what are the externalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would rather make is a simpler one - that university graduates have a much higher lifetime income, on average, than polytechnic and ITE graduates.&nbsp; And looking at the spectrum of students that we produce from our system, and how we should finance them, we should take that into account.&nbsp; University students are already receiving a far higher subsidy per year, and over the entire duration of their studies, compared to other students.&nbsp; So I think it is not just efficient, but equitable, for us to have some rebalancing, particularly at&nbsp;a time when university enrolments&nbsp;and costs go up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
