The  law  further provided for a  period  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths within which these options were required  to  be\r\n\r\nexercised, commencing 1st April, 1965. It followed that\r\n\r\nbachelors, who contracted monogamous marriages prior to\r\n\r\n1st  April, 1965, were accorded these options  as  they\r\n\r\nhad the status of contributors before that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law did not provide, however, for the cases of\r\n\r\nbachelors,  who  joined the service before  2nd  March,\r\n\r\n1961,  the  date prescribed in the Women's Charter  for\r\n\r\nmarriages   thereafter  to  be  monogamous,   if   they\r\n\r\ncontracted marriage after 1st April, 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no provision for such officers to be enabled\r\n\r\nto  choose to continue to contribute or to be  excluded\r\n\r\nfrom   contributing  to  their  widows'  and   orphans'\r\n\r\npension,  and  this Bill seeks to repair that  omission\r\n\r\nand  make legal provision for them to elect to  become,\r\n\r\nor  to  continue as, contributors within one  month  of\r\n\r\ncontracting monogamous marriages. Administrative action\r\n\r\nhas  already  been  taken  to call  upon  the  officers\r\n\r\naffected to opt whether to become contributors within a\r\n\r\nmonth  of  marriage.

Its purpose is mainly  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ncampaigns  for the study of the national  language,  to\r\n\r\nencourage the people to learn and use it, and  also  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the Government implement its language policy.  It\r\n\r\nis  hoped that the different races in Singapore will be\r\n\r\nable to use a common language in the near future. Since\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of this Dewan, it has  been  working\r\n\r\nassiduously in the promotion of the national  language.\r\n\r\nTwo National Language Months were held this year and we\r\n\r\nreceived keen support from all sections of the  people.\r\n\r\nCultural  groups and the Dewan co-operated in promoting\r\n\r\nthe  learning of the national language. Because of this\r\n\r\njoint effort, more and more non-Malays are studying the\r\n\r\nlanguage.  This can be seen from the number  of  people\r\n\r\nwho took part in Malay examinations in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when people are keenly responding to the\r\n\r\nmovement,   we   find  that  there  are  two   abnormal\r\n\r\nphenomena. The first is that one political Party, which\r\n\r\ncalls   itself  as  representing  the  Malays,  namely,\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.,  has  never  taken part in  the  Government's\r\n\r\ncampaign to promote the national language. This  causes\r\n\r\npeople to doubt what they say they represent. In actual\r\n\r\nfact,  Malay is their mother tongue. And now the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has made Malay the national language and has\r\n\r\nencouraged all people, including non-Malays,  to  learn\r\n\r\nMalay.  Yet  U.M.N.O. has not responded to our  appeal,\r\n\r\nThey  have totally disregarded and ignored our National\r\n\r\nLanguage  Month  and  the  promotion  of  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage. This is regrettable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another political Party is the Barisan Sosialis. They\r\n\r\nhave always been indifferent to the promotion of the\r\n\r\nnational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\nlanguage as though it has nothing to do with them.  Yet\r\n\r\nthey  claim  themselves to be a  political  Party  that\r\n\r\nsupports  Malay as the national language.  Their  claim\r\n\r\njudged from their action is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to sponsoring and conducting the National\r\n\r\nLanguage  Month  or National Language Week,  the  Dewan\r\n\r\nalso produces literature in the national language.  But\r\n\r\nI  feel  that there are other fields of work which  the\r\n\r\nDewan has not been able to undertake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether it will be able to do work in\r\n\r\nother  fields, such as the compilation of a  new  Malay\r\n\r\ndictionary,  because when we learn the Malay  language,\r\n\r\nwe  need  more reference books of this nature. Although\r\n\r\nthere   are   Malay  dictionaries  available   in   the\r\n\r\nbookshops,  they were compiled several years  ago,  and\r\n\r\nthe new words are not found in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that the Dewan should pay more\r\n\r\nattention to the promotion of the national language.  I\r\n\r\nfeel that the holding of National Language Month once a\r\n\r\nyear  is  not enough. In addition, it should also  hold\r\n\r\nforums  and discussion groups on the national  language\r\n\r\nto  encourage and promote its use. For instance, it can\r\n\r\nencourage   students  from  the  primary  or  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  to  learn the national language  so  that  the\r\n\r\nstudy  of  the  national  language  can  be  undertaken\r\n\r\njointly  by all people concerned. This will be a  great\r\n\r\nhelp in the promotion of the national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as we know, the national\r\n\r\nlanguage is accepted by all, as  it concerns us and transcends political consideration. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  conscious of the need  to  promote  and\r\n\r\npropagate the study of the national language  and  also\r\n\r\nto provide all possible facilities and encouragement to\r\n\r\nthe people to acquire proficiency in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1965, two National Language Months have been held,\r\n\r\nand as in previous national language campaigns, a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresentative committee with members from  the  public\r\n\r\nand  private  sectors,  including  employers  from  the\r\n\r\nChamber of Commerce and the Manufacturers' Association,\r\n\r\nand  cultural organisations have considered the overall\r\n\r\nprogramme of activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang has\r\n\r\nsuggested that U.M.N.O. and other political Parties did\r\n\r\nnot  participate fully in past campaigns and that  they\r\n\r\nshould  do so in the future. With regard to the absence\r\n\r\nof participation by U.M.N.O., I feel that this question\r\n\r\ncan  best  be  answered  by U.M.N.O. themselves.  Very\r\n\r\nunfortunately, they have been rejected by the people to\r\n\r\nhold  seats  in  this  House.  However,  I  shall  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of this opportunity to enlighten  the  House\r\n\r\nlater on our language policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the Member for Sembawang will agree\r\n\r\nthat  the  national language is common to and  concerns\r\n\r\nall our people, and efforts to popularise and propagate\r\n\r\nthe  study  of  it  should also  be  a  national  issue\r\n\r\ntranscending barriers of political ideology,  since  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  accepted by all. We therefore hope  that  in\r\n\r\nthis   pragmatic  approach  of  persuading  -  I   said\r\n\r\npersuading,  not  forcing - the  people  to  study  the\r\n\r\nnational  language, members of other political  Parties\r\n\r\nwill  also  fully and actively play their  part,  since\r\n\r\nthis is in the best interest of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Sembawang, I\r\n\r\nshould  like to state that the Government has spent  no\r\n\r\nless   than  $26,000  on  the  two  national   language\r\n\r\ncampaigns  carried  out this year. And  the  activities\r\n\r\nincluded  debates, essay competitions, forums, cultural\r\n\r\nactivities,  book  exhibitions  and,  above  all,   the\r\n\r\npublication by the Ministry of Culture of a book  known\r\n\r\nas  the Istilah, a book on Malay terms and designations\r\n\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  on  the  necessity to publish  a  dictionary\r\n\r\ncomprising  new  words and new terms  in  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage,  this is indeed a very good suggestion  which\r\n\r\nis worthy of consideration. The Ministry is, in fact,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  in  the process of making such a compilation.  The\r\n\r\nHouse  will  agree  with  me that  it  will  be  highly\r\n\r\nuneconomical  for  us  to publish  a  small  dictionary\r\n\r\ncomprising perhaps 20 to 30 words. So until  such  time\r\n\r\nas  the new terms and new words have been collected and\r\n\r\nput  into  a  sort  of dictionary, this  book  will  be\r\n\r\ncirculated  first  to  Members of  Parliament  and  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Government departments and then to members  of\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am also grateful to the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  for allowing me this opportunity to  explain\r\n\r\nto  the House the general attitude of the Government of\r\n\r\nSingapore to the national language issue. In  a \r\n\r\nmulti-racial,  multi-lingual and multi-cultural society  like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  believe that the only  way  to  achieve\r\n\r\nresults  is  by  means of persuasion, that  the  people\r\n\r\nshould  take  up the national language as a  matter  of\r\n\r\npride  as  citizens  of Singapore, and  not  by  force,\r\n\r\nthreats  and  intimidation. As we see, these  are  very\r\n\r\ncommonly   the   tactics  employed  by   the   language\r\n\r\nextremists in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot run away from the reality that whatever\r\n\r\nstatements and opinions are uttered across the Causeway\r\n\r\ndo  affect  Singapore, and during the short  two  years\r\n\r\nthat  we  were  in Malaysia, the amount of intimidation\r\n\r\nand  threats  by the language extremists  did  to  some\r\n\r\nextent  influence  the thinking of the  people  on  the\r\n\r\nnational  language issue.

I am only  quoting  this  as  an\r\n\r\nexample.  Old  tapes  are used and old  programmes  are\r\n\r\nbroadcast  on holidays and special occasions,  and  the\r\n\r\nofficers thus feel that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey have discharged their duties. Perhaps some of them\r\n\r\nthink  that the Minister of State for Culture does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  Tamil.  But  they  must  not  forget   that\r\n\r\nthousands  of  people  listen  to  the  news  and  view\r\n\r\ntelevision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T.V. has been functioning for the last three years and\r\n\r\nyet  there have been no improvements. Outside  artistes\r\n\r\nare  not given an opportunity to take part. In general,\r\n\r\nlocal  radio  artistes take part in more programmes.  I\r\n\r\nthink that three years is a long period to effect  some\r\n\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every nook and corner of Singapore, radios are\r\n\r\nturned  on.  But  they  broadcast mostly  Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nprogrammes. The reason for this is that the  programmes\r\n\r\nhere  are  not up to standard. The Singapore Government\r\n\r\ngets  $12  annually as a radio licence  fee  from  each\r\n\r\nsubscriber.  And  he  has  to be  satisfied  with  just\r\n\r\nlistening  to the Kuala Lumpur programmes. About  seven\r\n\r\nor  eight years ago, a Commission of Inquiry was set up\r\n\r\nto   investigate  into  the  Tamil  Section  of   Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore. After two or three years of that, I was told\r\n\r\nthat the programmes were good. The Ministry should  try\r\n\r\nto  do  something  to  bring up  the  standard  of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highly paid officials of the Radio and T.V.\r\n\r\nsection are not doing their duties properly. They  have\r\n\r\ngiven  most  of their jobs to the lower paid  staff.  I\r\n\r\nthink this is one of the reasons for the lower standard\r\n\r\nin  the  programmes.  In some cases,  applications  for\r\n\r\nbroadcasters  in  the  Radio  and  T.V. sections   are\r\n\r\ninvited. Both men and women are asked to apply. A voice\r\n\r\ntest  is given to the applicants. When these tests  are\r\n\r\ngiven to women especially, they are given dialogues  of\r\n\r\nlove  scenes  to read instead, and the men,  in  reply,\r\n\r\ngive  their  opinions. In fact, people who  are  really\r\n\r\ninterested in such talents are shocked by tests of this\r\n\r\nnature. I hope the Ministry of Culture will be able  to\r\n\r\nremedy  this state of affairs so that better programmes\r\n\r\ncan be provided for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, I have a\r\n\r\nlittle complaint against T.V. and Radio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

There are  several\r\n\r\ndaily  news casts over the radio and television in  the\r\n\r\nfour  language streams in Singapore. The radio news  is\r\n\r\nfrom  both the medium and shortwave network. This means\r\n\r\nthat it is heard not only in our neighbouring countries\r\n\r\nbut  also in those countries that are much further.  As\r\n\r\nhas  already  been pointed out in the  Address  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident,  every effort will be made by the Government\r\n\r\nto   publicise  fully  its  policies  and   activities,\r\n\r\nespecially  its  reaction  to political  situations  in\r\n\r\nother   countries,  particularly  in  the  neighbouring\r\n\r\nterritories. This is essential to Singapore's  position\r\n\r\nas  an  independent  country whose  future  depends  on\r\n\r\nworldwide   orientation  and  effort.  It  is   equally\r\n\r\nimportant  to provide an international content  in  our\r\n\r\ndaily  news  bulletins for our people and,  especially,\r\n\r\ncover  politics  and  happenings  in  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,   particularly  Malaysia   with   whom   our\r\n\r\nconnections and interest are basic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the comment by the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKapor,  namely, that the radio and T.V. have  given  an\r\n\r\nundue  over-coverage  of countries  outside  Singapore,\r\n\r\nparticularly in Malaysia, I should like to  state  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  a democratic country and we are not afraid  of\r\n\r\nany  adverse opinions or comments on us. We  also  feel\r\n\r\nthat the radio and T.V. are a public media which can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide  a channel of knowledge to the people,  and  we\r\n\r\nare  not  afraid of letting the people know  the  truth\r\n\r\nalthough it is painful at times!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the complaint by the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park on programme planning, I wish to\r\n\r\nassure the House that every programme on T.V. and radio\r\n\r\nis  carefully planned and timed, particularly according\r\n\r\nto  the  festive  seasons of the  various  communities.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

There are shortcomings and\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that  confront  us  from  time  to  time,\r\n\r\ndifficulties relating to obtaining good artistes -  for\r\n\r\nwe  wish  to  maintain  a fairly  high  if  not  decent\r\n\r\nstandard - and also the technical difficulties. Over the\r\n\r\nlast  few  years,  Radio Singapore and Television  have\r\n\r\ngrown  considerably. But the studio has not  grown.  We\r\n\r\nhope  that when the new studio is completed, there will\r\n\r\nbe an overall improvement, to the satisfaction of those\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have  complained about  the  standard  or\r\n\r\nquality of the programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement by the Member for Bras Basah goes to\r\n\r\nshow  that  we  are  more  than  fair  to  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  they  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  boycott the sittings of  this  House.  The\r\n\r\nMember has pointed out that on one single occasion  the\r\n\r\nradio  and  T.V. gave a good coverage to Dr  Lee  Siew\r\n\r\nChoh  at  a Press conference given by him, stating  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  the Barisan Sosialis should  boycott  this\r\n\r\nParliament.  This goes to show that the  allegation  by\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis that the radio and T.V. are  only\r\n\r\nreserved  for the Government use is far from  true.  We\r\n\r\nconsider  that if the people are kept informed  of  the\r\n\r\nhappenings in our country, whether they are  in  favour\r\n\r\nof  the  Government or are adverse to  the  Government,\r\n\r\nthen  we can build up faster the sophistication of  the\r\n\r\npeople, which is very essential to the survival of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

There  are\r\n\r\nonly  old  books  in the Tamil section. This  situation\r\n\r\nshould   be   remedied  and  newer  and  better   books\r\n\r\nbeneficial  to  the country should be  added.  Further,\r\n\r\nthere  should be a Tamil clerk to look after the  Tamil\r\n\r\nsection.

So mobile libraries and  branch\r\n\r\nlibraries should be opened up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. Those who have completed their\r\n\r\neducation  should  not waste the  knowledge  they  have\r\n\r\nacquired; and children, in order to improve themselves,\r\n\r\nshould go on reading. If they continue with this habit\r\n\r\nof  reading, they will be able to contribute better  to\r\n\r\nsociety.

We should teach  the  people\r\n\r\nhow  to  make  use  of the facilities of  the  library.\r\n\r\nBranch  libraries  should be opened  up.

The number of Tamil books\r\n\r\nlent  to  adults  and children has also increased  from\r\n\r\n3,760 in 1959 to 22,074 in the year 1965, that is, from\r\n\r\nJanuary to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nto  set up branch libraries, I wish to inform the House\r\n\r\nthat  the National Library has now two part-time branch\r\n\r\nlibraries   in  the  Joo  Chiat  and  Siglap  Community\r\n\r\nCentres.

Many\r\n\r\npeople  have  been victimised by this  yellow  culture.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why we want to suppress the growth of  yellow\r\n\r\nculture to safeguard the healthy growth of the people's\r\n\r\nminds.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have quoted the policy on culture\r\n\r\nformulated  by  the P.A.P. in 1959 and ever  since  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been following it. On the one  hand,  we\r\n\r\nare trying to promote healthy culture and, on the other\r\n\r\nhand, we are ruthlessly suppressing foreign immoral and\r\n\r\nyellow  culture.  Therefore,  in  the  past  few  years\r\n\r\nhealthy culture has been thriving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what surprises me is that recently in many cinemas\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  unhealthy and yellow  films  have  been\r\n\r\nshown.  This  causes us grave concern.  This  unhealthy\r\n\r\nculture  can  be classified under the following  heads:\r\n\r\nfirstly, fiction pictures; secondly, fighting pictures;\r\n\r\nand   thirdly,  romantic  and  immoral  pictures.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, most of these films come from  Japan  or\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines. Their contents are absurd and against\r\n\r\nethical  values, the stories are very absurd too.  Most\r\n\r\nof  these films show armed robberies and illegal sexual\r\n\r\nrelations between men and women. They appeal to  people\r\n\r\nof  low  taste. They will undermine the  minds  of  our\r\n\r\nadolescents  and  young  people.  If  we  continue   to\r\n\r\ntolerate  such  unhealthy  films  being  shown  in  our\r\n\r\ncinemas  here, they will not only annul the  effort  we\r\n\r\nhave made in the past to destroy yellow culture, but it\r\n\r\nwill also lead to an increase of all sorts of crime  in\r\n\r\nour  society. Therefore, in the interest of the people,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to urge the Minister concerned  to  take\r\n\r\nimmediate  action  to put a stop to  the  screening  of\r\n\r\nunhealthy  pictures  and that the  Film  Censors  Board\r\n\r\nshould   carry  out  more  stringently  its   work   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  our cultural policy  and  allow  more\r\n\r\nhealthy   films,  educational  films,  films  of   high\r\n\r\nartistic  value  to  be  imported  into  Singapore  for\r\n\r\nscreening.  As a newly emergent nation, we should  have\r\n\r\nthe  nourishment of a healthy culture to enable the two\r\n\r\nmillion people of Singapore to benefit from it  and  to\r\n\r\ninculcate in our people a healthy ideological outlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full\r\n\r\nagreement with my friend the Member for Sembawang  that\r\n\r\nthe  Film Censors Board must be careful about censoring\r\n\r\nindecent  films. The deleterious effects of  indecency,\r\n\r\nviolence,  crime and immorality are too well known  for\r\n\r\nme to preach a sermon here. But I think we are becoming\r\n\r\ntoo  dangerously tolerant or liberal in  this  respect,\r\n\r\nand some drastic steps seem to be called for. That much\r\n\r\nfor the Film Censors Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have received a representation\r\n\r\nfrom  a cinema operator and film distributor that delay\r\n\r\nhas  been unduly caused by this Film Censors Board.  It\r\n\r\nis  obvious that films imported from Taiwan, Hong Kong,\r\n\r\nJapan,  and even for that matter, from Communist China,\r\n\r\nhave  been unduly delayed. In this connection,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhope the Film Censors Board should try to expedite  the\r\n\r\ncensoring  of  these films as quickly as  possible.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  may  have to be careful that  these  films\r\n\r\nimported  from  the countries I have mentioned  earlier\r\n\r\nhave  to be treated with the same caution. By all means\r\n\r\nwe  agree, knowing full well ourselves the struggles we\r\n\r\nhave  been through to defeat anti-national forces.  But\r\n\r\nsurely the process of censorship can be expedited  with\r\n\r\nno weakening of our armour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grumble amongst the importers of these films is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Censor authority takes a long  time  -  some\r\n\r\nthree  to  four months - to screen these films.  It  is\r\n\r\npretty  well  known that films usually are imported  to\r\n\r\ncoincide with certain festive occasions and periods  in\r\n\r\nthe year when the importers believe the films will make\r\n\r\nthe  biggest impact. You can, therefore, imagine,  Sir,\r\n\r\ntheir  quandary perhaps to find that after having  paid\r\n\r\nthrough their noses to get the film into Singapore,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  get  through the censor barriers  until  the\r\n\r\nseason  for that picture is completely over.  In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the importer, instead of having a  large\r\n\r\nbox office draw, loses a lot when the film for which he\r\n\r\npays so much gets out of season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this is a genuine complaint, and I hope it\r\n\r\nwill be met. But I want to make it clear, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthat I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nholding  no  particular brief for these  operators.  My\r\n\r\nonly  interest  is that there is a crying  need  for  a\r\n\r\nsensible arrangement. We do not want our citizens to be\r\n\r\ndeprived  of their measure of appropriate entertainment\r\n\r\nbecause  the wheels in the Film Censors Board  move  so\r\n\r\nvery  slowly. They can be made to move faster  so  that\r\n\r\ncinema  operators  can  confidently  arrange  for   the\r\n\r\nentertainment  of  this  section  of  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I have similar views on this subhead.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Government's measures against yellow culture\r\n\r\nhave  been  very  well carried out.  But  I  have  also\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that there are some loopholes.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nfrom the point of view of film importers, if Government\r\n\r\ncan only relax certain regulations, they will stand  to\r\n\r\nbenefit.  If  Government  can  only  allow  strip-tease\r\n\r\nshows, this will appeal to them very much because  this\r\n\r\nis  in their own interest. However, the Government will\r\n\r\nhave  to carry out certain measures in accordance  with\r\n\r\nits  cultural  policy. This is even more  so  now  that\r\n\r\nSingapore has achieved independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised certain points,\r\n\r\nand  I  have certain views about them. Sometimes it  is\r\n\r\nnot   the  substance  that  matters.  It  may  be  film\r\n\r\nimporters have used various means to attract members of\r\n\r\nthe   public,   or   perhaps  they  have   purposefully\r\n\r\nemphasised  certain sexual scenes in order  to  attract\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes in a story various means are used to arouse\r\n\r\nthe  emotions  of the people so as to attract  them  to\r\n\r\nthese  films  for their own benefit. I personally  feel\r\n\r\nGovernment should introduce strict measures to stop the\r\n\r\nfilm  operators  from using immoral means  and  various\r\n\r\nsexual  appeals  in  advertising  certain  films.  Some\r\n\r\nadvertisements  are really appalling. I have  forgotten\r\n\r\nthe titles of these films. In the Tiong Bahru and Tiong\r\n\r\nPoh areas, I have come across certain advertisements in\r\n\r\nwhich  there  were four ladies in very  short  panties.\r\n\r\nThey were scantily dressed in order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattract passers-by and these advertisements were placed\r\n\r\nat  street corners. Motorists too were attracted to the\r\n\r\nadvertisements.  As  a result of  this,  the  lives  of\r\n\r\nothers were endangered by these motorists driving their\r\n\r\nvehicles.  I feel it is my duty to point out  the  very\r\n\r\nsexual  appeal  in the advertisements. I  am  convinced\r\n\r\nthere are other films which have not been passed by the\r\n\r\nFilm  Censors  Board and these are particularly  sexual\r\n\r\nfilms  of  an  immoral content. I hope the  Board  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to adopt stringent measures in this  respect.\r\n\r\nThere are films which have not been passed in Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  have been passed in Johore. So you will invariably\r\n\r\nfind  crowds  of people going to Johore to  view  these\r\n\r\nfilms  which  have been extensively advertised  in  the\r\n\r\nlocal   Press.  Often  the  advertisements  appear   in\r\n\r\nmysterious ways, sometimes even with question marks, in\r\n\r\norder  to  arouse the curiosity of the people and  make\r\n\r\nthe films more mysterious and more appealing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I begin by\r\n\r\nbriefly  informing the House of the policy of the  Film\r\n\r\nCensors with particular emphasis on Japanese films. Out\r\n\r\nof  a total of 900 original feature films dealt with by\r\n\r\nthe  Film  Censors Board this year up to the middle  of\r\n\r\nDecember, about 130 were films of Japanese origin,  the\r\n\r\nmajority of which were Mandarin dubbed or intended  for\r\n\r\nMandarin dubbing. Of these 130 Japanese films, about 20\r\n\r\nwere  passed without cuts, 90 with cuts, and 20  banned\r\n\r\naltogether.  This constitutes about the highest  figure\r\n\r\npercentage-wise  of  films  cut  or  banned.  There  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no  reason  why Japanese  films  dubbed  in\r\n\r\nMandarin, or any other language for that matter, should\r\n\r\nbe  singled out for unduly rough or harsh treatment  by\r\n\r\nour  Film Censors. Sir, the Film Censors Board is fully\r\n\r\naware  of  the nature of these films and each  film  is\r\n\r\ncensored  on  its own merits. Censorship  of  films  is\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the\r\n\r\ncensorship  directives which are as  realistic  and  as\r\n\r\nliberal  as possible. Sir, we have no control over  the\r\n\r\nquality of the films. The production\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Japanese films is usually and surprisingly high and\r\n\r\nthose that have been released are deemed to be suitable\r\n\r\nfor  public exhibition. The reason for the increase  in\r\n\r\nsuch films in Singapore is in reality two-fold. On  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  as  stated above, these  films  enjoy  wide\r\n\r\npopularity and so the exhibitors bring them in in large\r\n\r\nnumbers.   Notwithstanding  the  adverse  comments   by\r\n\r\nvarious Members earlier, there are many people who have\r\n\r\ncommented  favourably on Japanese-produced films.  Then\r\n\r\nagain  there  have been criticisms too. These  opposing\r\n\r\nfactors,   however,  merely  serve  to  underline   and\r\n\r\nemphasise  what  censorship work involves.  It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible   to  please  everybody  at  the  same   time.\r\n\r\nDifferences of opinion must exist, and indeed it  is  a\r\n\r\nhealthy sign that differences of opinion do exist,  for\r\n\r\nthey  indicate interest in what is going on around  us.\r\n\r\nBut  they must be aired in the spirit of give and take.\r\n\r\nNo  one  sector of opinion should impose its will  upon\r\n\r\nthe  other with absolute finality. Sir, even  when  the\r\n\r\nBoard  makes  a decision on the film, that decision  is\r\n\r\nnot final. It is subject to appeal by the exhibitors to\r\n\r\nthe  Film Appeals Committee. They could bring it up for\r\n\r\ndecision by the Appeals Committee. Sir, the decision of\r\n\r\nthe  Appeals  Committee - whose members  are  appointed\r\n\r\nannually  by  the  Minister and who come  from  various\r\n\r\nwalks of life - over-rides that of the Board. There are\r\n\r\nmany films which were partly or wholly rejected by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  but were released for exhibition by the  Appeals\r\n\r\nCommittee  either with less cuts than  they  originally\r\n\r\nrequired or completely uncut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to deal briefly with some of the\r\n\r\ncomments  made  by  the Members earlier.  We  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  that we are an affluent society and, therefore,\r\n\r\nthe situation has now completely changed since 1959. We\r\n\r\nwill  have to be more liberal in our approach, but that\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean that we completely lose  sight  of  our\r\n\r\nParty's  policy.  It is difficult,  particularly  in  a\r\n\r\nplace like Singapore which is multi-racial, for one  to\r\n\r\nimpose  the  standard of morality of one  community  on\r\n\r\nanother  with  differences  in  background,  education,\r\n\r\nculture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  tradition. No one can claim that he is an  arbiter\r\n\r\nof   morality.  Nevertheless,  we  consider  that  film\r\n\r\ncensorship in Singapore is about the strictest in  this\r\n\r\npart  of  the world. We are so strict that, as  pointed\r\n\r\nout by the Member for Delta, there appears to be a \r\n\r\none-way  traffic going across the Causeway. I say good luck\r\n\r\nto  the bus companies and the film exhibitors in Johore\r\n\r\nBahru.  Sir,  this  goes to show  that  our  policy  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from that across the Causeway. We  are  more\r\n\r\nliberal  with films which have a political aspect.  But\r\n\r\nwe   are  very  strict  with  films  that  we  consider\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the morality of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Sembawang has implied in his\r\n\r\ncomments that we are responsible for not showing  films\r\n\r\nof  educational  value. The House will appreciate  that\r\n\r\nthe  contents of production and the number of films  on\r\n\r\neducational aspects are completely out of our  control.\r\n\r\nIn  as  much as we try to bring up a very cultured  and\r\n\r\nrefined society, we must also not forget entertainment.\r\n\r\nI  am  sure the film companies and film exhibitors  are\r\n\r\nvery  sensitive  about profits and,  therefore,  we  at\r\n\r\nleast  must be as cultural and as entertaining  in  the\r\n\r\nexecution of the Film Censors' work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Bras Basah has complained of the\r\n\r\nundue delay caused by the Film Censors Board. I wish to\r\n\r\nstate  that  we  view  films  practically  every   day,\r\n\r\nsometimes up to eight or nine films a day, and there is\r\n\r\nno  undue delay as suggested by him. We normally notify\r\n\r\nthe  exhibitors of the films that are banned or  passed\r\n\r\nwith  cuts, and if they so desire, they may  appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe   Appeals  Committee.  If  the  films  are   banned\r\n\r\naltogether,  the  Film Censors Board  normally  returns\r\n\r\nthem  to the exhibitors well in time for them to return\r\n\r\nto  the distributors. If the Member could assist me  by\r\n\r\nquoting one instance of which film was delayed, I shall\r\n\r\ntake up the matter with my officials and see to it that\r\n\r\nno  undue  delay will be caused in future to  any  film\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by  any film exhibitors. I would  also  call\r\n\r\nupon the Member for Delta\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  Member  for Sembawang to  quote  me  specific\r\n\r\ninstances  where they consider Japanese films,  or  for\r\n\r\nthat  matter any other films, are undesirable in  order\r\n\r\nthat  we  may consider their opinions. Perhaps  we  may\r\n\r\neven adopt them in our film censorship policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\njust  now  in  his reply has said that our  society  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  that  existing before  1959.  This  is\r\n\r\nundeniable,  of  course. But in  the  past  we  were  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  territory;  now we are  controlling  our  own\r\n\r\nfate.   Ours  is  an  independent  country.  Therefore,\r\n\r\neverything  will  have  to  be  decided  by  ourselves.\r\n\r\nEverything  should progress with time. We  should  also\r\n\r\nremember that the development of culture is multi-fold.\r\n\r\nIt  depends on how we guide its development. It is  not\r\n\r\nright  that  if in 1959 there were Yang Ko  dances,  we\r\n\r\nshould  pursue them also this year. It is  not  logical\r\n\r\nthat  we should pursue now what has taken place in  the\r\n\r\npast.  Our  culture is developing with  the  times;  it\r\n\r\nshould   also  be  able  to  accommodate   the   racial\r\n\r\ncharacteristics and habits of the different communities\r\n\r\nin  order  that the cream of the various  cultures  can\r\n\r\nblossom forth and contribute to the general culture  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.

I have never been a frequent cinema-goer,\r\n\r\nso  I do not know what is going on in the cinemas.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  I would suggest is that we should have a movement\r\n\r\nfor  a healthy culture - healthy dances and dramas  and\r\n\r\nso  on  -  to  compete  with the so-called  not-so-good\r\n\r\nculture  or a bit yellowish culture, which hon.

He said that, in regard to\r\n\r\nculture,  the Government's policy would not be contrary\r\n\r\nto  what has been laid down in 1959. I am glad to  hear\r\n\r\nthat.  I  also agree with him that one section  of  the\r\n\r\npeople cannot impose the characteristics of its culture\r\n\r\non  the other sections of the people. I should tell him\r\n\r\nthat  I  have never mentioned that we should do  so.  I\r\n\r\nhave  never said that Chinese culture is the  only  one\r\n\r\nthat  is  healthy or that Western culture is  the  only\r\n\r\nhealthy one. So if the Parliamentary Secretary has been\r\n\r\nvague about this in his speech, I hope he will clarify.\r\n\r\nAs  regards  the film, \"War and Peace\", there  is  also\r\n\r\nsome  controversy over it.

We  gave it a lot of publicity. We  talked  and\r\n\r\nwrote   much   about  it.  There  were  daily   special\r\n\r\nprogrammes  over television. You also might  have  seen\r\n\r\nand listened to all these programmes, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\"Bahasa Bersama\" is the title of one of the programmes.\r\n\r\nGirls  were  shown  in this programme.  The  television\r\n\r\ncamera  was  focusing on the breasts  of  these  girls.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the camera man was very happy about it. But the\r\n\r\npeople  are not very happy about it. We have to condemn\r\n\r\nsuch activities. It is the duty of the Government to do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Tamil Section of Radio Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  be  improved.  Although  more  time  has   been\r\n\r\nallotted on T.V. for Tamil programmes, we never see any\r\n\r\ngood  programmes. I hope the Head of the Tamil  Section\r\n\r\nwill look into this. After the Radio news, a report  is\r\n\r\ngiven  of  the  parliamentary proceedings whenever  the\r\n\r\nHouse  meets. In this programme, Members' speeches  are\r\n\r\nreported.  I  have listened to them. But there  is  one\r\n\r\nshortcoming.  Last  night,  at  8.45  p.m.,  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nSection   gave   a   broadcast  on  the   parliamentary\r\n\r\nproceedings.  It was stated that I had  requested  that\r\n\r\ntelevision sets should be installed in all the wards in\r\n\r\nMiddleton Hospital. This is wrong. What I said was that\r\n\r\nthe children's wards in all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhospitals  should be provided with T.V. sets.  I  hope\r\n\r\nsuch  mistakes will not occur in future. At  times  the\r\n\r\npeople   have  criticised  radio  programmes   in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, particularly in the Tamil newspapers.  When\r\n\r\nsuch  cases come up, the Ministry should not just  keep\r\n\r\nquiet but should take action to remedy the defects.  It\r\n\r\nshould  also announce to the public that such criticism\r\n\r\ncould be forwarded to the Minister direct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

Annually   we\r\n\r\nappropriate a sum of more than $10 million  for  public\r\n\r\nassistance. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Social Affairs has already stated that  last  year\r\n\r\npublic assistance came to $10 million. But this year it\r\n\r\nis  only  $9  million.  This  shows  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nreduction in public assistance, and the reason given is\r\n\r\nthat  the  number  of  people  seeking  assistance  has\r\n\r\ndecreased  and,  therefore, the  expenditure  also  has\r\n\r\ndecreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I have received many complaints from members of\r\n\r\nthe public that their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplications to the Department concerned for assistance\r\n\r\nhave been delayed unduly. What are the reasons? I would\r\n\r\nlike the Minister concerned to look into the matter and\r\n\r\nto  see how best to deal with it. Our Government  is  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  looks  after  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  especially the poorer class, and we should  be\r\n\r\nsympathetic  to  such  people  who  apply  for   public\r\n\r\nassistance. The staff in the Social Affairs Department,\r\n\r\nbeing  public servants, should be sympathetic to people\r\n\r\nwho need assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that recipients of public assistance are mostly\r\n\r\naged  people who have no means to rely upon to  make  a\r\n\r\nliving,   and  widows,  widowers  and  other  destitute\r\n\r\npeople.  Some of these people have been unemployed  for\r\n\r\nquite  a long time and are unable to get some means  of\r\n\r\nsupport.  Their situation is very difficult and  should\r\n\r\nmerit our sympathy. Therefore, since our Government  is\r\n\r\none  that looks after the interests and welfare of  the\r\n\r\npeople, special attention should be paid to this matter\r\n\r\nso  that we can be of assistance to them. Yet there are\r\n\r\nsome  Government officers who are not properly carrying\r\n\r\nout  Government's policy in this regard,  and  so  they\r\n\r\nhave not been able promptly to deal with cases in, say,\r\n\r\napproving  applications and giving out the  assistance.\r\n\r\nThe recipients earnestly hope that they will be able to\r\n\r\nreceive  their aid in time, because they have to  incur\r\n\r\nvarious  family expenses, such as rent for their  house\r\n\r\nand  other things. As far as I understand it, the delay\r\n\r\nhas  been even up to six months, and the shortest delay\r\n\r\nis three months. So I would like the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nto investigate and see whether there are such instances\r\n\r\nof delay or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Ministry concerned to give\r\n\r\nspecial attention to applications for public assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  people  in rural areas. Usually when  replies  to\r\n\r\nthese  people are delayed for several weeks, they  will\r\n\r\nhave to go to the Social Welfare Department to enquire,\r\n\r\nthus  incurring  transport expenses to  town  and  also\r\n\r\nexpenses  for  their meals when in town. We  know  that\r\n\r\nthese poor people cannot afford\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch expenses, and if the Department concerned can help\r\n\r\nthem, it will reduce their burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng): Mr Speaker, normally it\r\n\r\ntakes  about  two weeks to consider an application  for\r\n\r\npublic  assistance  from the date of its  registration,\r\n\r\nfor  the application has to be investigated, processed,\r\n\r\nand  given  a decision. However, there are cases  where\r\n\r\napplicants  -  (a) have furnished incorrect  addresses,\r\n\r\n(b)  leave addresses which are difficult to locate, and\r\n\r\n(c)   require  a  thorough  investigation  into   their\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  In  all  these  cases,  some  delay  is\r\n\r\nunavoidable as more than one home visit will have to be\r\n\r\nmade and a fuller investigation required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few months the Social Welfare Department\r\n\r\nhas  had to cope with special assignments, for example,\r\n\r\nthe  relief  and  rehabilitation of  victims  of  civil\r\n\r\ndisturbances  in July and September 1964,  the  special\r\n\r\nassistance  scheme for fishermen who were  affected  by\r\n\r\nthe curfew imposed in Singapore coastal waters in early\r\n\r\n1965,  and  a  special  scheme  for  payment  of   rent\r\n\r\nsubsidies  to  Malay families who are affected  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's redevelopment scheme. As a result of these\r\n\r\nspecial assignments, investigation officers have had to\r\n\r\nbe  taken off their normal public assistance work. This\r\n\r\nhas   resulted  in  an  unavoidable  slowing  down   of\r\n\r\ninvestigation of public assistance cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action is in hand to recruit more staff for the public\r\n\r\nassistance   section.  It  is  hoped  that   with   the\r\n\r\nemployment of additional staff, it will be possible  to\r\n\r\nspeed up the investigation of public assistance cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

The creches provide care and\r\n\r\ntraining for children of a few weeks' old to five years\r\n\r\nof age, whose mothers are working and who cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  send them to private kindergartens. Every child  is\r\n\r\ngiven  breakfast,  lunch, and  tea,  and  free  medical\r\n\r\nattention is provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creches are open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Mondays\r\n\r\nto  Fridays and from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturdays. The\r\n\r\nten  creches  have a daily total average attendance  of\r\n\r\nover 300. It has been found that the ten creches, which\r\n\r\nare  located in various parts of Singapore,  appear  to\r\n\r\nhave met the need for this type of service, so that  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  there  is no demand for  an  extension  of\r\n\r\nservice. In fact, a number of our creches, for example,\r\n\r\nthose  at  Manila  Street and Bukit Ho  Swee,  are  not\r\n\r\nfilled to capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 16 children's centres run by the Department have a\r\n\r\ndaily  total  average attendance of over  1,000.  These\r\n\r\ncentres provide elementary education for children  who,\r\n\r\nfor  some  reason or other, cannot be admitted  to  the\r\n\r\nschools run by the Ministry of Education. They are open\r\n\r\nfrom  9 am. to 5 p.m. on Mondays to Fridays and from  9\r\n\r\na.m. to  12 noon on Saturdays. The children  attending\r\n\r\nthese  centres  are  from 5 to 13 years  of  age.  They\r\n\r\nreceive  snacks  of  milk,  vitamins,  buns,  and  free\r\n\r\nfruits.  Free  medical  and dental  treatment  is  also\r\n\r\nprovided.

Ariff  bin\r\n\r\nSuradi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan) (In\r\n\r\nMalay): Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 he reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead 2063.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, each recipient of public assistance from\r\n\r\nthe  Social Welfare Department realises and knows  that\r\n\r\nthe  money given to him is not for his maintenance  but\r\n\r\nto  assist  him  to  stave off hunger.  If  I  am  not\r\n\r\nmistaken  the head of a family gets $21, his wife  gets\r\n\r\n$10, and each child under the age of 18 years gets  $5.\r\n\r\nThis  total  is at times reduced by the Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment.  For instance, when an inspector  from  the\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department comes round to investigate  a\r\n\r\nfamily receiving public assistance, the person is asked\r\n\r\nwhether it is sufficient or not. The officer knows that\r\n\r\nthe  amount is insufficient. But because the  recipient\r\n\r\nis  sincere, he says that he has to seek other means of\r\n\r\nincome. When it is found that he has other means to get\r\n\r\nsome  money, for instance, by selling cakes and so  on,\r\n\r\nso  as  to enable him to pay for the transport expenses\r\n\r\nof  his  children, his public assistance  allowance  is\r\n\r\ncut. This is very unsatisfactory because the assistance\r\n\r\ngiven  to  such recipient is inadequate and, therefore,\r\n\r\nhe has to find other ways to augment his income. So the\r\n\r\nmethod  employed by the inspector in carrying  out  his\r\n\r\ninvestigations into such matters is unsatisfactory.  On\r\n\r\ngetting the answer, the allowance is cut for the coming\r\n\r\nmonth.  If  an  elderly person is  entitled  to  public\r\n\r\nassistance and he stays by himself - if he merely stays\r\n\r\nin the place for shelter - he is given only $4 and not\r\n\r\n$21.  This  too  is a matter about which  I  feel  most\r\n\r\nunhappy. Although he should be getting $21, he  is  not\r\n\r\ngiven  it  simply because he has to stay  with  someone\r\n\r\nelse.  For  this reason he is given only  $4.  So,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  request  that the Minister  concerned \r\n\r\nre-consider both these matters that I have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to raise concerns\r\n\r\nthe public assistance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  to Malays who are affected by the urban  renewal\r\n\r\nscheme.

I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to draw the attention of the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nthis  matter,  and I hope he will be able to  enlighten\r\n\r\nthis House on the measures he proposes to implement for\r\n\r\nassisting these poor fishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like the Minister also to inform\r\n\r\nthis  House  that if an applicant for public assistance\r\n\r\nhas two wives, whether both of them will be included in\r\n\r\nthe  assessment of public assistance allowance. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nbeg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, under this Head, we see that the Government is\r\n\r\nvoting $9,600,000 for 1966 and yet for 1965 it was  $10\r\n\r\nmillion.  There is a great difference in the  vote.  We\r\n\r\ncan  expect, therefore, that some applicants for public\r\n\r\nassistance  may not be able to get assistance,  because\r\n\r\nof  a  reduction in this vote. Just now the Member  who\r\n\r\nspoke on this subject also mentioned this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister concerned a few\r\n\r\nquestions.  To  give an example, if a couple  have  two\r\n\r\nchildren  and  they get $30 public assistance  with  no\r\n\r\nother  sources  of income, they will  not  be  able  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  themselves  and their two  children  on  this\r\n\r\nmeagre   sum.  Therefore,  under  these  circumstances,\r\n\r\npossibly one of the family - maybe the wife - will have\r\n\r\nto go out and do some work, such as washing clothes for\r\n\r\nothers, in order to get some extra income which will be\r\n\r\nabout  $30  per  month. Under these circumstances,  the\r\n\r\ncouple's  public  assistance from  the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment might be cut by the same amount. Let us also\r\n\r\nsay that one of the children gets a temporary job at  a\r\n\r\nsalary  of between $30 and $40 a month. Such  a  meagre\r\n\r\nincome  may be enough for the child's expenditure,  but\r\n\r\nit  is  likely that the Social Welfare Department  will\r\n\r\ncut  off all the assistance given to that family.  Thus\r\n\r\nthis  will  give  the  public the impression  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  get  public  assistance  from  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department are those who stay at home  and  do\r\n\r\nnot  go  to work and that if they go out and make  some\r\n\r\nmoney  for themselves, their allowance will be  cut  by\r\n\r\nthe  same amount that they earn. So they might as  well\r\n\r\nnot go to work. They might\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\nas  well  depend  forever on public  assistance.  These\r\n\r\nthings are quite common in my constituency and that  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I mention them in this House. There are such cases\r\n\r\nin my constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to give another example. An aged\r\n\r\ncouple  with no children drew public assistance of  $20\r\n\r\nper  month  for  quite some time.  After  paying  their\r\n\r\nmonthly  rental,  they had nothing left.  They  had  no\r\n\r\nother  alternative but to seek other means of income.\r\n\r\nThis  couple told me frankly of their plight. They said\r\n\r\nthat  they  could  earn an income of  about  $20.  They\r\n\r\nwanted  to  know,  if  the  Social  Welfare  Department\r\n\r\nofficers  approached  them  in  the  course  of   their\r\n\r\ninvestigation,  whether they would  have  to  tell  the\r\n\r\nofficers frankly about this extra income. Since I  have\r\n\r\nto  look after the interests and welfare of the  people\r\n\r\nin  my  constituency. I was in a dilemma,  not  knowing\r\n\r\nwhat  to  tell them, whether or not to advise  them  to\r\n\r\ntell  the  Social  Welfare Department officers  frankly\r\n\r\nthat they were in receipt of an extra income of $20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Minister concerned will deal with this\r\n\r\nkind of cases and adopt a better method whereby if  any\r\n\r\ncut were to be made in public assistance to any family,\r\n\r\nhe  should take into consideration other facts and  cut\r\n\r\nonly the part in respect of the working members of such\r\n\r\na family. I hope he will give due consideration to this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to associate\r\n\r\nmyself  with the views expressed by my three colleagues\r\n\r\nwho  have  spoken before me. I notice that $10  million\r\n\r\nwas estimated for this year and $9,600,000 for 1966;  a\r\n\r\nvast  sum of $400,000 has thus been deducted. I say  \"a\r\n\r\nvast  sum\"  because we know that people look to  public\r\n\r\nassistance  not because they like to enjoy  the  bitter\r\n\r\nbread  of  charity  but  because of  extreme  financial\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in view of this, I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nenlighten  this House on the reason for budgeting  $9.6\r\n\r\nmillion for next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, I think one has to\r\n\r\nface a lot of hard facts in life. Getting money from\r\n\r\nthe Government is one of them and the Government has a\r\n\r\nduty to look after the taxpayers' money and not just\r\n\r\npay it out without looking into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, first of all, answer the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan on the point he has raised just now?  As  the\r\n\r\ntotal  payment under the public assistance  scheme  has\r\n\r\nbeen  rising very steeply from $7.2 million in 1961  to\r\n\r\n$9.7  million  in  1963, and as  a  result  of  reports\r\n\r\nreceived  by the Department of large numbers of  public\r\n\r\nassistance recipients receiving public assistance under\r\n\r\nfalse  pretences - the majority of recipients who  find\r\n\r\njobs  fail to report to the Department and continue  to\r\n\r\ndraw  public  assistance although they  are  no  longer\r\n\r\neligible - it was decided to start a systematic  review\r\n\r\nof  all  public assistance cases in April  1964.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of this review, it has been found that, on  the\r\n\r\naverage,   about  20  per  cent  of  public  assistance\r\n\r\nrecipients  are  bogus cases. This review  has  enabled\r\n\r\nbogus  cases  to be closed and the money available  for\r\n\r\npublic  assistance relief to be diverted to the  really\r\n\r\ndeserving  cases of families whose heads are  genuinely\r\n\r\nunemployed.   Public   assistance   recipients    whose\r\n\r\nallowance has either been stopped or reduced can always\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the Assistant Director (Public  Assistance)\r\n\r\nfor  reconsideration. On receipt of an appeal, the case\r\n\r\nis  reinvestigated and if circumstances  are  disclosed\r\n\r\nwhich   merit  the  continuance  of  public  assistance\r\n\r\nrelief, the case is reinstated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan on housing subsidies, for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing,  the subsidies are only confined to those  Malay\r\n\r\nfamilies   who   are  affected  by  urban   development\r\n\r\nprojects, who have a total income of less than $300 and\r\n\r\nwho  wish to occupy Housing Board flats. But as for the\r\n\r\nothers  who  are  not  affected  by  urban  development\r\n\r\nprojects,  the  Government, of course,  is  willing  to\r\n\r\nstudy their cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  is  that those who are staying with  friends\r\n\r\nhave  their subsidies deducted. I hope that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong Kembangan can take up such cases with  our\r\n\r\nMinister. We shall look into these cases also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to matters raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nChangi,  according to the records of the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment, a total of 163 fishermen living  in  Changi\r\n\r\nhave  been  referred to the department  for  assistance\r\n\r\nunder the scheme. As a result of investigations carried\r\n\r\nout  by the department, 22 of these families have  been\r\n\r\nfound eligible and have been given assistance under the\r\n\r\nscheme.  The  balance of 141 were found ineligible  for\r\n\r\nassistance  under the scheme for various  reasons.  For\r\n\r\nexample, some have been found to be already in  receipt\r\n\r\nof  public  assistance; others have  found  alternative\r\n\r\nsources  of  income  which render them  ineligible  for\r\n\r\nassistance. Secondly, there are cases in which a public\r\n\r\nassistance applicant has two wives and both of them are\r\n\r\nincluded in the assessment for public assistance relief\r\n\r\nif  the  department is satisfied that both of them  are\r\n\r\nwithout income of their own and are dependent upon  the\r\n\r\napplicant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Punggol, it will take a\r\n\r\nconsiderable time to go through the records  of  public\r\n\r\nassistance  pensions  for  a number  of  recipients  in\r\n\r\nPunggol  constituency,  as the  records  are  kept  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a whole and not broken up by constituency\r\n\r\nor  by  area. In fact, a number of requests  have  been\r\n\r\nreceived from Members of Parliament asking for  a  list\r\n\r\nof    public    assistance    recipients    in    their\r\n\r\nconstituencies, and the Social Welfare  Department  has\r\n\r\nbeen   hard   put  to  it  to  provide  the   necessary\r\n\r\ninformation. Members of Parliament who have  asked  for\r\n\r\nthis information and have not been supplied with it are\r\n\r\nrequested  to be patient, is the work involved  in  the\r\n\r\ncompiling   of  the  information  required   is   quite\r\n\r\nconsiderable.  It  is regretted that  it  will  not  be\r\n\r\npossible to inform the Member for Punggol of the number\r\n\r\nof  applications which have been submitted to  him  and\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  successful,  as  this  will  involve\r\n\r\nsearching through every public assistance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfile  which has been opened for the last 5 or 6  years.\r\n\r\nAs  there  are about 30,000 public assistance cases  in\r\n\r\naction,  it  will be appreciated that this  involves  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable amount of work which the public assistance\r\n\r\nsection, which has a lot of work daily, will be  unable\r\n\r\nto  undertake  at  the moment. I think  these  are  the\r\n\r\npoints raised by the Member for Punggol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Ulu Pandan, he has raised the\r\n\r\npoint   that  public  assistance  relief  be  paid   to\r\n\r\nrecipients  who are engaged in casual work.  Under  the\r\n\r\npublic  assistance scheme, relief is paid on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  a  means test under which the following  limits  of\r\n\r\nincome  are not taken into account - first, a recipient\r\n\r\nwith  no dependants, $10; second, a recipient with  one\r\n\r\nor  two dependants, $15; third, a recipient with  three\r\n\r\nor  four dependants, $20; fourth, a recipient with five\r\n\r\nor  more  dependants,  $25. Thus  a  public  assistance\r\n\r\nrecipient  who  has  five or more  dependants  and  who\r\n\r\nearns,  say,  $50 a month from casual  labour  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed to retain $25 of his income. The remaining  $25\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  be deducted from his public  assistance\r\n\r\nallowance.  In some cases, however, it is difficult  to\r\n\r\nascertain  the  amount of income  earned  by  a  casual\r\n\r\nlabourer; and in such cases, a rough and ready rule  is\r\n\r\napplied and the average monthly income is estimated  at\r\n\r\n$40. Each case is, of course, treated on its own merits\r\n\r\nand  where  there  are  special circumstances  meriting\r\n\r\nsympathetic  treatment, the recipient is usually  given\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  the  doubt and, where  possible,  the\r\n\r\nminimum  amount deductible under the scheme is deducted\r\n\r\nfrom the public assistance allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

There\r\n\r\nare  applicants whose living conditions are  appalling.\r\n\r\nBut  there  are also applicants who possess  their  own\r\n\r\nhomes  and  some are living in rented homes.  The  same\r\n\r\namount  of  public assistance from this  department  is\r\n\r\nreceived for the same number of dependants.

A family lived in a Geylang  Serai  flat\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the Housing and Development  Board.  When\r\n\r\nthe  head of the family first occupied the flat, he was\r\n\r\nemployed  in a small Chinese firm. Not long after,  the\r\n\r\nfirm wound up, and he became unemployed. He applied for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  assistance  from the Social Welfare  Department\r\n\r\nand  he  received an amount of $46. The rental  of  his\r\n\r\nflat was $46.50, not including water and light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the public assistance he received was\r\n\r\ninsufficient  to support his family,  he  had  to  wash\r\n\r\nclothes  and  his daughter had to sell cakes.  When  an\r\n\r\ninvestigator from the Social Welfare Department came to\r\n\r\nknow  that he was earning some money by washing clothes\r\n\r\nand  selling cakes, his public assistance was  stopped,\r\n\r\nalthough  he  had  explained his circumstances  to  the\r\n\r\ninvestigator concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the special allowance given to a person who\r\n\r\nlives  in his own house is $21. In the case of  another\r\n\r\nwho  is  a lodger, the allowance is $4. When the person\r\n\r\nappealed  to the Department concerned in order  to  get\r\n\r\nmore public assistance, he was advised to move out  and\r\n\r\nlive on his own, which means that he would have to rent\r\n\r\na room. If he can only get $21 from this Department and\r\n\r\nhe has to pay a rental of $20, then the balance will be\r\n\r\na  paltry sum. This will cause more hardship to him.  I\r\n\r\nhope this matter will receive due consideration by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, under the public\r\n\r\nassistance  scheme,  the  rates  of  payment   are   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  certain rules of  eligibility  and  a\r\n\r\nmeans test.

Whilst\r\n\r\nwe  were  part  of  Malaysia, certain  Singapore  boats\r\n\r\npreferred  to  obtain their fishing licences  from  the\r\n\r\nState of Johore, because boats registered in the States\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  were  given preferential treatment  by  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Navy Patrols, and it was for that reason that\r\n\r\nthe  boats from Punggol obtained their registration  in\r\n\r\nJohore and left their nets in one of the coastal  towns\r\n\r\nin  the  east  coast  of  Johore whilst  operating  and\r\n\r\nselling  their catch in Singapore. With the separation,\r\n\r\nhowever,  the position has now changed, and the  owners\r\n\r\nof  these boats have been informed that at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis year their licences, on termination, will not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrenewed  in  Johore.

So this  actually\r\n\r\nhas nothing to do with the P.S.C., but it has something\r\n\r\nto  do  with the Department which is going to  put  out\r\n\r\nadvertisements to recruit members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House should be grateful to the Member for  Delta\r\n\r\nwho, before the Government could take up the suggestion\r\n\r\nof  having a Women's Research Institute on the problems\r\n\r\nfacing women, has done some research on her own.

A penghulu\r\n\r\nfrom  Pulau Tekong, that is from my constituency, will,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  spend $2 as launch fare to Changi  Point\r\n\r\nand  back.  Another $1.50 is spent  on  bus  fare  from\r\n\r\nChangi Point to the City and back to Changi Point.  And\r\n\r\nperhaps a few cups of tea or coffee and lunch will cost\r\n\r\nhim, say, about $1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the expenditure incurred by the penghulus\r\n\r\nand  ketuas  in carrying out their official  duties  is\r\n\r\nconsiderably high, I wonder how much the penghulus  and\r\n\r\nketuas  from the Southern Islands will have  to  spend.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would suggest that the allowances for  the\r\n\r\npenghulus and ketuas be given considerable increment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my argument is that since the pro-Communist\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis M.P.s can be paid a tax-free allowance\r\n\r\nof  $500  each to fight our own people, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nfair  that the penghulus and the ketuas who are working\r\n\r\nfor the interests of the people should be paid a little\r\n\r\nbit more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nChangi  has  raised the question of  allowance  to  the\r\n\r\npenghulus and ketuas.

Such houses were built more than 10 years  ago,\r\n\r\nand   today,  with  social  amenities  like  water  and\r\n\r\nelectricity supplies being available in many  parts  of\r\n\r\nPunggol  constituency,  many  of  the  constituents  in\r\n\r\nunnumbered houses have come to me to seek my assistance\r\n\r\nto  get  for them permits for existing houses in  order\r\n\r\nthat  they  can obtain house numbers so that  they  can\r\n\r\napply for such facilities. Sir, the point is this.  The\r\n\r\napplication  forms are printed in the English  language\r\n\r\nonly,  and  I also notice that on the form  itself  the\r\n\r\napplicant making such an application has no opportunity\r\n\r\nto  state his date of application and that at the  back\r\n\r\nof this form the applicant has to draw a sketch plan of\r\n\r\nthe site indicating where his existing house is and, at\r\n\r\nthe same time, draw a sketch plan of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of rendering such assistance, I\r\n\r\nfind  that  if I were to request the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nto  see  to it that such forms are printed in the  four\r\n\r\nofficial  languages, then I am sure that many of  these\r\n\r\napplicants would be able to fill up the forms easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. The form being duly completed\r\n\r\nwill  be  submitted to the Chief Building Surveyor  who\r\n\r\nwill  look into the matter. Now I have come across such\r\n\r\napplications which had to wait for more than two months\r\n\r\n- I am not simply alleging this complaint, but it it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  I  am prepared to furnish such  particulars,\r\n\r\nthat   officials  of  the  Chief  Building   Surveyor's\r\n\r\nDepartment sometimes take up to two months to  visit  a\r\n\r\nsite  and later on when a permit is approved and  a  $2\r\n\r\nfee  is  paid,  even then a house number is  not  given\r\n\r\nuntil one or two months later. So, all in all, it takes\r\n\r\nthree to four months, sometimes six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the application for permits to\r\n\r\nreconstruct   existing  houses.  Sir,  in   the   rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  such houses are made up of plank walls and  attap\r\n\r\nroofs. Very often, when such applications are made, the\r\n\r\nhouses  are  in  a  very  poor  condition,  and   these\r\n\r\nconstituents need to get permission as soon as possible\r\n\r\nto  go  ahead with reconstructing them. I would suggest\r\n\r\nto  the Minister concerned to look into the possibility\r\n\r\nof  establishing  a  small unit in the  Chief  Building\r\n\r\nSurveyor's  Department purely to look  into  these  two\r\n\r\nmatters  and to help the poor people, not  only  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, but also in other rural constituencies as\r\n\r\nwell, by facilitating these applications, so that  they\r\n\r\ncan  get  what they have applied for within as short  a\r\n\r\nperiod   of  time  as  possible  and  with  as   little\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to  them as possible.  For  example,  in\r\n\r\norder  to apply for permission to reconstruct a  house,\r\n\r\nthe  poor  chap  will have to go down to  the  Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment to buy two site plans. Many of these  people\r\n\r\nare  not  familiar with site plans and more often  than\r\n\r\nnot  they  buy the wrong ones because first, they  have\r\n\r\ngot  to go down to the Planning Department and tell the\r\n\r\nofficer  what they want and they are not able  to  read\r\n\r\nand  understand the site plans well. So in view of what\r\n\r\nI  have pointed out, I hope the Minister concerned will\r\n\r\nkindly look into those two matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol wants to know why requests from rural residents\r\n\r\nor  farmers  to  reconstruct their existing  houses  or\r\n\r\nretain  their existing house numbers are being  delayed\r\n\r\nand  whether a small unit should be set up in the Chief\r\n\r\nBuilding Surveyor's Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the problem of unauthorised houses in Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been reduced ever since the end of World  War  II.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of such unauthorised houses and the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been realistic in not taking  action  to\r\n\r\nput the residents occupying unauthorised houses out  of\r\n\r\nthem,  but  rather  to  permit  them  to  remain  there\r\n\r\ntemporarily. It has been considered dangerous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif we were to regularise every unauthorised house, even\r\n\r\nthough  it has been in existence for a number of years,\r\n\r\nfor  the  simple reason that it will mean  putting  the\r\n\r\nstamp of legality on something that is unauthorised. It\r\n\r\nwill  soon  be  accepted to mean that  the  people  can\r\n\r\nconstruct   houses  without  bothering  to  apply   for\r\n\r\npermission  and with the passage of time  these  houses\r\n\r\nwill  be authorised. Since the Government is not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  throw out families living in unauthorised\r\n\r\nhouses,  each house will be authorised with the passage\r\n\r\nof  time. The Chief Building Surveyor's Department  has\r\n\r\nbeen  dealing with this problem for some time.  Efforts\r\n\r\nhave  been  made to contain the problem  within  limits\r\n\r\nrather  than to provide a solution. Wherever  possible,\r\n\r\nthose  houses  that could comply with the building  \r\n\r\nby-laws  would  be regularised and the owners  could  then\r\n\r\nobtain house numbers to enable them to get supplies  of\r\n\r\nelectricity  and water. For those houses which  are  so\r\n\r\nirregular  as to be unable to comply with the  building\r\n\r\nby-laws,  the Chief Building Surveyor cannot regularise\r\n\r\nthem  and  they will have to remain as they are  or  be\r\n\r\ndemolished. It will be difficult for the Government  to\r\n\r\nregularise  such  unauthorised  and  newly  constructed\r\n\r\nhouses which go against certain building by-laws.  Now,\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Building Surveyor's Department will  assist\r\n\r\nthe  farmers or rural residents to obtain the necessary\r\n\r\ntemporary building permits, and there is no need to set\r\n\r\nup  a  special unit just to assist them.
