For  ease   of\r\n\r\nreference,  I will hereafter refer to this  lowest\r\n\r\ntender for rent as the public rental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1st July, 1971, a rising rental\r\n\r\nconcession  was  also granted whereby  shopkeepers\r\n\r\nwere required to pay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly 70 per cent of the public rental in the first\r\n\r\nyear  of  tenancy,  the  payments  of  rent  being\r\n\r\nincreased  at  the  rate of 10 per  cent  annually\r\n\r\nuntil  the full public rental was reached  in  the\r\n\r\nfourth   year.   To   further   assist   resettled\r\n\r\nshopkeepers,  a new resettlement policy  increased\r\n\r\nthe  concession rate after 1st July, 1971, whereby\r\n\r\na  rental subsidy of 50 per cent is granted in the\r\n\r\nfirst year, and the payments are increased at  the\r\n\r\nrate of 10 per cent per year until the full public\r\n\r\nrental  is  reached in the sixth year. Apparently,\r\n\r\neven  this further increase of rental subsidy  has\r\n\r\nnot  worked out to be fair and reasonable  in  all\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise hardship suffered by shopkeepers, the\r\n\r\npolicy  has  recently  been  reviewed  and  a  new\r\n\r\nformula   worked  out  whereby  the   rental   for\r\n\r\nresettlement cases for shops is fixed at a reduced\r\n\r\nrate  of 90 per cent of the public rental. As from\r\n\r\nJuly   this   year,  resettled  shopkeepers   will\r\n\r\ninitially  pay  only 50 per cent  of  the  reduced\r\n\r\npublic  rental  in  the first year  and  a  rental\r\n\r\nincrease  of 10 per cent per year until the  sixth\r\n\r\nyear.  The  rental  for the sixth  and  subsequent\r\n\r\nyears  is, in fact, equivalent to 90 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  rental so that resettled  shopkeepers\r\n\r\nwill  continue to enjoy a rent rebate  of  10  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the  public rental from the  sixth  year\r\n\r\nonwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further safeguard against the rents being\r\n\r\nset  too high by erratic public tenders, the Shops\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  the  Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nwill   fix   an  appropriate  rent  for  resettled\r\n\r\nshopkeepers where the public rental is  more  than\r\n\r\ntwice  that of the minimum rental approved by  the\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  when a business partnership is formed,  will\r\n\r\nsuch  a  partnership enjoy the  rebates?

We want higher quality in\r\n\r\njobs,  schools, hospitals, social and recreational\r\n\r\namenities and homes. The crucial pre-condition for\r\n\r\nfulfilling  these objectives is smaller  families.\r\n\r\nOnly then can more resources and care be given  to\r\n\r\neach child, by the parents and by the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Family Planning Programme has in the\r\n\r\nlast  six years been able to achieve some  measure\r\n\r\nof  success.  It has brought down the  high  birth\r\n\r\nrate  of  28.8 per thousand in 1966  to  22.3  per\r\n\r\nthousand in 1971. But there are many people who do\r\n\r\nnot  practise family planning. These couples still\r\n\r\nwant large families. About 35 per cent of children\r\n\r\nborn  are of a fourth or higher order born to  the\r\n\r\nfamily. The problem is made worse because most  of\r\n\r\nthese  children are born to families who are least\r\n\r\nable  to feed them and nurture them. These parents\r\n\r\ncannot give their children opportunities equal  to\r\n\r\nthose of children in smaller families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an industrialised and highly urbanised\r\n\r\nSingapore  of  the  1970's, a large  family  is  a\r\n\r\ntragedy  for  the  children,  a  burden  to  their\r\n\r\nparents, and a drag\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   the   whole  society.  Infant  mortality   in\r\n\r\nSingapore is one of the lowest in the world.

The majority of the\r\n\r\nparents with three or more children cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto provide their children with adequate and proper\r\n\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children suffering from inadequate protein, iron\r\n\r\nand vitamins during their formative years, tend to\r\n\r\nbe  seriously retarded in their brain development.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly reflected in a study of Primary VI\r\n\r\nexamination  results  among  a  group   of   1,123\r\n\r\nchildren.  This  study showed that among  children\r\n\r\nwho are well-nourished 77 per cent of them passed,\r\n\r\nand  only  23  per  cent  failed.  Those  who  are\r\n\r\naveragely nourished 51.4 per cent passed, 48.6 per\r\n\r\ncent  failed. But of those who are under-nourished\r\n\r\nonly  23.9  per  cent passed, and  76.1  per  cent\r\n\r\nfailed.  Health  and  malnutrition  factors   were\r\n\r\ncompounded by lack of maternal care and  of  books\r\n\r\nand recreational toys of educative value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government plans to eradicate the present\r\n\r\npockets of malnutrition in children to ensure  the\r\n\r\nmental and physical development of our young.  But\r\n\r\nthese plans can only be partially successful.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  must be tackled at source, by  preventing\r\n\r\nsuch large families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy expands, wages will go up, But the\r\n\r\nrise  in  wages  will not bring a better  life  to\r\n\r\nthose  families  who  increase  their  burdens  by\r\n\r\nhaving more children to feed, clothe, and nurture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When parents have more children than they can\r\n\r\nadequately feed and care for, these children  will\r\n\r\nhave  poorer diet and health. Their education  and\r\n\r\ntraining will suffer and they will remain  at  the\r\n\r\nlower levels of lower incomes in unskilled jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of subsidies by the Government can\r\n\r\nremedy the lack of adequate food and care at home.\r\n\r\nSubsidised  meals in schools cannot  make  up  for\r\n\r\nwhat  they should get at home. Children do not  go\r\n\r\nto  school  until the age of six,  by  which  time\r\n\r\npermanent damage would already have been done.

In\r\n\r\neffect,  the Government has to increase  taxes  to\r\n\r\nsubsidise  people  with  low  incomes  and   large\r\n\r\nfamilies.  It  is a vicious cycle  which  we  must\r\n\r\nbreak.  It  is  kinder  in the  long  run  to  put\r\n\r\ndisincentives on large families. Certainly it will\r\n\r\ncarry  less danger of social tension, overcrowding\r\n\r\nand   generally  lowered  standards  in  the  very\r\n\r\nlimited  space  of Singapore. The quality  of  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  standards of  life  must  suffer\r\n\r\nunless  we take strong measures now to stop  large\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, social friction and tensions will\r\n\r\nincrease  between those with small families  whose\r\n\r\nchildren  will in turn do well, because of  better\r\n\r\nhealth  and  social factors, and those with  large\r\n\r\nfamilies  whose numerous children will  do  poorly\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are deprived of adequate  food  and\r\n\r\ncare.  To  bring up each child up to  his  or  her\r\n\r\nfullest  potential,  we must  break  this  vicious\r\n\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, too frequent child-bearing means\r\n\r\nphysical  exhaustion  and adverse  effect  on  the\r\n\r\nmother's health. The incidence of women dying as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  child  birth rises sharply  after  the\r\n\r\nfourth  pregnancy. Weakened mothers are unable  to\r\n\r\nwork and supplement the family income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our society is to become more just and equal,\r\n\r\nsmaller families must be actively encouraged,  and\r\n\r\nlarge ones actively discouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accouchement fees, maternity leave, priority\r\n\r\npoints  for homes will be so adjusted to encourage\r\n\r\ntwo  children  per family.

I quite agree with\r\n\r\nwhat  he  has said. But what about the couple  who\r\n\r\nhave two girls? Therefore, if they want to have  a\r\n\r\nboy,  then most probably they have to adopt a  boy\r\n\r\nfrom another country, if the couple is limited  to\r\n\r\ntwo   children.  This  restriction  is  very  bad,\r\n\r\nbecause  we are going against nature. The Minister\r\n\r\nshould  consider this matter over  again.  He  can\r\n\r\ntell  the  people  to  go  for  sterilization   or\r\n\r\nabortion.  That  is  a different  matter.  But  he\r\n\r\nshould  not  introduce a policy saying  that  each\r\n\r\nfamily should have only two children, because this\r\n\r\nrestriction  is bad for our country.  Why  do  the\r\n\r\nWestern countries, such as America, not have  such\r\n\r\na  policy?  It  is  because they want  people  for\r\n\r\nnational  service.

There are many basic factors that\r\n\r\nnone of us can change and through no fault of  our\r\n\r\nown;   for  example,  our  land  area,  our  human\r\n\r\nresources,    our   financial   capability,    our\r\n\r\nvulnerability to factors outside Singapore. Having\r\n\r\na  large  family is, and I do not like to use  the\r\n\r\nword  \"feudalistic\",  I think  basically  a  rural\r\n\r\npsychology or philosophy - the larger the  family,\r\n\r\nthe more hands to work in the field. Naturally the\r\n\r\nadvantage  is evident in a situation like  in  old\r\n\r\nChina  and in India, and even in the greater  part\r\n\r\nof  agricultural countries in Southeast Asia where\r\n\r\nthe  female  offspring is normally regarded  as  a\r\n\r\nloss and economically non-productive, particularly\r\n\r\nin  some  of  the  older fashions  of  the  Indian\r\n\r\ncommunity  where a handsome dowry has  got  to  be\r\n\r\npaid  when they marry off a daughter. But that  is\r\n\r\napplicable in a rural agricultural society. It has\r\n\r\nno  relevance to Singapore, which is cosmopolitan.\r\n\r\nThe  less people we have, the less tension we will\r\n\r\ncreate.

We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  move people much more by persuasion  than  by\r\n\r\nimposing  additional fees or  any  other  measures\r\n\r\nlike  minimising  priorities  or  imposing  higher\r\n\r\naccouchement fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My contention is that the family planning\r\n\r\nprogramme  has not been sufficiently  intensified.\r\n\r\nIf  you  have  worked in, say, the Kandang  Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital,  you will notice the degree of ignorance\r\n\r\nof  many people who come from the rural areas.  To\r\n\r\nthem,   family  planning  means  nothing,  it   is\r\n\r\nnonexistent, or they know nothing about it at all.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  should, therefore,  intensify  this\r\n\r\ncampaign in the rural areas and also, in terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  future, get it across to the schools. I think\r\n\r\nall our youngsters must know this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the accouchement fees which\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has mentioned. It seems to  me  that\r\n\r\nthere is hardly any difference in the accouchement\r\n\r\nfee charged for the C class as compared with B  or\r\n\r\nA  class. A person who can afford an A class  ward\r\n\r\nneed  pay  only $250 for the third child,  whereas\r\n\r\nthe one who goes into C class pays $100. $100 to a\r\n\r\nC  class  ward  patient could  well  mean  half  a\r\n\r\nmonth's salary, but $250 means nothing to one  who\r\n\r\ncan  afford  an  A  class  ward.  If  we  are   to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  large  families,  we  must  discourage\r\n\r\neveryone, not just the poor but the rich as  well.\r\n\r\nI think there are many factors as to why we should\r\n\r\nhave  small  families. The family should  be  kept\r\n\r\nsmall,  irrespective of whether he is from a  poor\r\n\r\nsocial class or the rich. I therefore say that the\r\n\r\naccouchement fee rates must be revised so that  if\r\n\r\nwe  are  to  discourage  the  poor  we  must  also\r\n\r\ndiscourage the rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I take the point\r\n\r\nbrought up by the Member for Anson about a  couple\r\n\r\nhaving  two female children? Although he is rather\r\n\r\nvague and diversified in his comments. I think his\r\n\r\npoint is that if you have two female children, you\r\n\r\nmay  want  a  male,  then what  happens?  In  this\r\n\r\nmodern,  urbanised  and industrialised  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  sexes of the children should not count. After\r\n\r\nall, we have the Women's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharter,  and so on. We have equal pay for  women.\r\n\r\nSo  we  should not discriminate between  male  and\r\n\r\nfemale children He also mentioned that restricting\r\n\r\nthe   number  of  children  to  two  is  a  rather\r\n\r\ndangerous  policy.  On the contrary,  and  I  have\r\n\r\nstated this in my Ministerial Statement, if you do\r\n\r\nnot limit the number, particularly in the case  of\r\n\r\nfamilies  who  cannot afford  to  bring  up  their\r\n\r\nchildren properly, you are going to create  social\r\n\r\ntension  between  those who are  poorly  paid  and\r\n\r\nunskilled, because their parents were not able  to\r\n\r\neducate  or  nurture them, and  those  from  small\r\n\r\nfamilies because their parents have given them the\r\n\r\nbest.  Therefore, limiting the number of  children\r\n\r\nper  family will mean that in 15 or 20 years time,\r\n\r\nwe  will have less social tension. We will have  a\r\n\r\nmore  just and equal society. If we do not do  so,\r\n\r\nwhatever we do in subsidies we cannot bring  about\r\n\r\na  more  just  and equal society. I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson wants to have a more  just  and\r\n\r\nequal society in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point brought up by the Members for Bukit Ho\r\n\r\nSwee,  Changi and Mount-batten, is that not enough\r\n\r\ntime  has  been  given to persuade the  people  to\r\n\r\nconfine  to  small families. As I have stated,  we\r\n\r\nhave just held a mass family planning campaign.  I\r\n\r\nwonder what the Member for Changi was doing  then.\r\n\r\nDid  he  go round to his constituents to propagate\r\n\r\nthe  concept  of  the  small  family?  As  far  as\r\n\r\npublicity  about family planning is  concerned,  I\r\n\r\nhave  said  that  we have had the family  planning\r\n\r\nservice  since  1966, six years ago.  In  fact,  a\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  on family planning was presented  in\r\n\r\nthis  House by my predecessor. Campaigns on family\r\n\r\nplanning had been launched before and there is  no\r\n\r\nexcuse  for  members  of the public  not  to  know\r\n\r\nanything  about family planning. Our surveys  have\r\n\r\nshown that although they know what family planning\r\n\r\nis, a percentage of them do not want to accept it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is not the case of the public  being\r\n\r\nignorant of family planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that was brought up is that we are\r\n\r\nlimiting  the number of children to two.  What  we\r\n\r\nare advocating is that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo is the ideal. It does not mean that you cannot\r\n\r\nhave  three or four. If you can afford it, by  all\r\n\r\nmeans,  have  three  or four. But  if  you  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to bring up two children properly, then  I\r\n\r\nthink it is criminal for you to bring up three  or\r\n\r\nfour. It might be satisfying to you yourself,  but\r\n\r\nplease  remember that the third and  fourth  child\r\n\r\nyou  bring forth may have no prospects of a better\r\n\r\nlife in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding accouchement fees, the Member for Kim\r\n\r\nSeng  mentioned that there is not much  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  the C class and the A class. Well,  there\r\n\r\nis  a difference, but it narrows down to the point\r\n\r\nwhen  the mother comes for her fourth child. As  I\r\n\r\nhave  said, this is a matter of cutting  down  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies.  We  subsidise the first two  children.\r\n\r\nFor  the third child, we subsidise slightly  less,\r\n\r\nbut  there will be no subsidy whatsoever  for  the\r\n\r\nfourth  and  fifth child. As I  have  said  in  my\r\n\r\nMinisterial Statement, if a person cannot pay  the\r\n\r\nhigher accouchement charges, how then can he  have\r\n\r\nthe  means and the ability to bring up a child  so\r\n\r\nthat  he  or she will have an even chance  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture for a better life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point brought up by the Member for Bras Basah\r\n\r\nis  that  birth is an accident. I do not  think  I\r\n\r\nshould comment on that. I hope the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah has not come into the world by accident!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the Minister has not\r\n\r\nanswered  my query regarding the priority  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board point system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sorry, I missed that point.

And some countries\r\n\r\neven  do not like to see us succeed gradually.  As\r\n\r\nin  the case of political parties, institutions of\r\n\r\nhigher learning in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  country will also be targets for manipulation\r\n\r\nby  these foreign elements. There must be a reason\r\n\r\nwhy our students become indifferent to the society\r\n\r\nand  the country in which they live, and for  them\r\n\r\nto  adopt  a hostile attitude towards our society.\r\n\r\nIf  we  are  not  vigilant  enough,  some  of  our\r\n\r\ninstitutions and students may engage in activities\r\n\r\nbeyond the\r\n\r\nscope  of  their  function under  the  pretext  of\r\n\r\ncultural  exchanges. On the one hand,  we  welcome\r\n\r\ninternational scholars to come here and  genuinely\r\n\r\nhelp  us improve our academic standards, in  order\r\n\r\nto  realise  what the President has  said  in  his\r\n\r\nAddress   that  \"we  can  become  a   centre   for\r\n\r\nexcellence in all fields important to our economic\r\n\r\nand  cultural life.\" On the other hand, we  should\r\n\r\nguard    against   the   possibility   that    our\r\n\r\ninstitutions of higher learning or even the  whole\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  will one day become  a  centre  for\r\n\r\ninternational  espionage  under  the  pretext   of\r\n\r\ncultural exchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the addendum relating to the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education, we are happy to note  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  has laid emphasis on  the  need  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the quality of teachers, teaching methods\r\n\r\nfor  the second language, and the quality  of  the\r\n\r\nteaching  curriculum. This shows that the teaching\r\n\r\nand  the curriculum of the second language in  the\r\n\r\npast  were far from satisfactory; and my  argument\r\n\r\nis well-founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has issued a\r\n\r\nbooklet  of  certain simplified Chinese characters\r\n\r\nwhich  are used by the Chinese press. This booklet\r\n\r\nis  to help those who want to learn Chinese  as  a\r\n\r\nsecond language. However, in the Primary I Chinese\r\n\r\ntextbook  used  in  English  schools,  though  the\r\n\r\ncharacters  are  of  the simplified  version,  the\r\n\r\nworkbook,  however  uses characters  of  the  non-simplified version. Therefore, the same  character\r\n\r\nappears  in  two  forms. If this is  already  very\r\n\r\nconfusing  to  those who learn  Chinese  as  their\r\n\r\nmother-tongue, it will be even more  confusing  to\r\n\r\nthose primary pupils who learn Chinese as a second\r\n\r\nlanguage. I understand that after complaints  have\r\n\r\nbeen made to the Ministry, the workbook\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been withdrawn. The experts on the curriculum\r\n\r\ncommittee  should  be responsible  for  permitting\r\n\r\nsuch  unnecessary  difficulty to  creep  into  the\r\n\r\nlearning of Chinese as a second language. Besides,\r\n\r\nin  the  Primary  II  textbooks  for  Chinese  and\r\n\r\nCivics,   both  the  simplified  and  unsimplified\r\n\r\nversions  are  used.  If such textbooks  are  used\r\n\r\nagain, changes must be made. Similarly, there  are\r\n\r\nfaults with the second language textbooks for non-English  schools.  In  the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nthere is one specialist in teaching English  as  a\r\n\r\nsecond language. He compiled a textbook for use in\r\n\r\nprimary  schools  as a textbook on  English  as  a\r\n\r\nsecond  language. I do not know who  approved  it,\r\n\r\nbut before it could be used, there were criticisms\r\n\r\nin   the  English  press  pointing  out  the  many\r\n\r\nmistakes in it. As a result, this textbook was not\r\n\r\nreleased  for  use. If textbooks  written  by  our\r\n\r\nsecond  language  specialists  contain  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmistakes,  we  can  well imagine  the  quality  of\r\n\r\ntextbooks written by non-specialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the incidents I have cited,\r\n\r\nin  order  to improve the teaching of  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage,   first   of   all,   the   quality   of\r\n\r\nadministration  in  the Ministry,  the  curriculum\r\n\r\ncommittee   and   that  of  the  second   language\r\n\r\nspecialists  should  be  raised  in  addition   to\r\n\r\nimproving  the quality of pedagogy and curriculum.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  there  will  be  repetition   of   the\r\n\r\nincidents  cited and our second language  teaching\r\n\r\nwill  always  be in a confusing and  disappointing\r\n\r\nstate.  We are now going all out to implement  our\r\n\r\npolicy  of bi-lingual education in order that  our\r\n\r\nnext generation will be effectively bi-lingual and\r\n\r\nthat  the  society we are going to have in  future\r\n\r\nwill be more unified and cohesive. However, such a\r\n\r\npolicy  should not be exploited by publishers  who\r\n\r\nare   out   to  make  money.  Otherwise  students,\r\n\r\nparents, and the public will waste their money  in\r\n\r\nbuying textbooks which are dubious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the task ahead is to mobilise\r\n\r\nour  human  and financial resources  in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve  in qualitative terms.

I\r\n\r\nwould  advocate  that a National Computer  Service\r\n\r\nCentre   be  set  up  so  that  all  the   various\r\n\r\nMinistries  and departments can make use  of  this\r\n\r\ncomputer   service,   and  thus   increase   their\r\n\r\nefficiency.

Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  the  President's  speech  outlining  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policies for the next five  years,  I\r\n\r\nnote with pleasure the acceptance of the necessity\r\n\r\nfor  the level of wages to rise in so far as  such\r\n\r\nwage increases take place in an orderly fashion. I\r\n\r\nnote with further pleasure, and they do not assume\r\n\r\nthe  proportions  of  a galloping  inflation,  the\r\n\r\nassurance  that tax increases are to be kept  down\r\n\r\nto the barest minimum possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has always been the legitimate complaint of\r\n\r\nworkers  that whatever wage increases they receive\r\n\r\nare  more  likely  than not swallowed  up  by  tax\r\n\r\nincreases  and price increases. While I appreciate\r\n\r\nvery much the particular concern of the Government\r\n\r\nnot  to  kill  the individual incentive  for  hard\r\n\r\nwork-  on which Singapore's prosperity is built  -\r\n\r\nby raising direct taxation upwards to the level of\r\n\r\ndiminishing returns, I am somewhat disappointed at\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  recourse to indirect  taxation,\r\n\r\neven though it be on the so-called \"luxury\" goods.\r\n\r\nFor  one  thing, I have my doubts  as  to  whether\r\n\r\nthere   is   any   general  acceptance   of   what\r\n\r\nconstitutes    \"luxury\"   goods.   For    another,\r\n\r\nGovernment may give more serious consideration  to\r\n\r\nthe distinction between earned income and unearned\r\n\r\nincome for the purposes of taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite aware that as a Backbencher it is easy\r\n\r\nfor me to criticise and that the Government, being\r\n\r\nmuch   better  informed  and  having  to  consider\r\n\r\nfactors such as the development of Singapore  into\r\n\r\na  financial  centre  for  the  region,  may  have\r\n\r\nconsidered  and  dismissed  some  of  my   points.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I feel it incumbent upon me to voice\r\n\r\nwhat  I  consider  to be the rather  disappointing\r\n\r\nfeatures  of the Government's recent tax measures.\r\n\r\nIt  is  hard  to believe, for instance,  that  tax\r\n\r\nincreases  on  such luxuries as  beer,  stout  and\r\n\r\ncigarettes affect the privileged class of  persons\r\n\r\nmore  than  the  wage-earners. Similarly,  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of motor car taxes, no attempt is made  to\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  between  a family  of  wage-earners,\r\n\r\npooling  their resources together to buy  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst time in their lives a medium-sized car,  and\r\n\r\na  tycoon  who  thinks nothing of  buying  several\r\n\r\nlimousines perhaps for each of his concubines. The\r\n\r\njustification advanced by the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nfor   such   taxation  -  to  discourage   private\r\n\r\nownership of cars - seems rather cynical, if I had\r\n\r\nnot known that he was sincere about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that taxation\r\n\r\nmeasures  form  part of the fiscal policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  that  such  measures   are   not\r\n\r\neminently suitable for the attainment of  socially\r\n\r\ndesirable objectives. The Government may  have  to\r\n\r\ncontemplate  more  direct and drastic  methods  of\r\n\r\nkeeping  cars  off the streets, especially  during\r\n\r\npeak  hours.  One method may be the staggering  of\r\n\r\noffice  hours beyond the prevailing  limits  of  8\r\n\r\na.m. and  5  p.m. It would be in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nrationale  underlying the PUB's  restructuring  of\r\n\r\ntariff  charges.  But  if the  actual  purpose  of\r\n\r\nincreased  taxation is to raise  more  revenue,  I\r\n\r\nhave  nothing  more  to comment  upon  except,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, how this estimated increase in revenue  of\r\n\r\n$38.25 million is going to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his address made reference to,\r\n\r\nand I quote him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a better life for everyone willing to work will\r\n\r\nbecome  more  pronounced,  and  in  more  gracious\r\n\r\nsurroundings.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay  I suggest that we pay a little more attention\r\n\r\nto  those who are willing to work but who, because\r\n\r\nof  mental or physical handicap or for some  other\r\n\r\ncogent  reasons, are unable to work. The President\r\n\r\nalso   mentioned  that  \"we  can  achieve   higher\r\n\r\nstandards  in  everything, with  the  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nquality,  whether  in  jobs,  schools,  hospitals,\r\n\r\nsocial  and  recreational amenities or homes.\"  He\r\n\r\nwent  on to say that there must be heavy subsidies\r\n\r\nfor  good  health and good education. I  certainly\r\n\r\nsubscribe to this principle. The trouble  is  that\r\n\r\nnot   all   citizens,  through  no  conscious   or\r\n\r\ndeliberate   fault  of  their  own,   have   equal\r\n\r\nopportunities   to   avail   themselves   of   the\r\n\r\nsubsidised services of the Government in the field\r\n\r\nof health or education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that one category of our\r\n\r\ncitizens  deserves  much more attention  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment than they have enjoyed so far. I make a\r\n\r\nplea on behalf of the old-age destitutes, the deaf\r\n\r\nand dumb, the blind, the mentally retarded and the\r\n\r\nchronically ill. Most of these persons are  looked\r\n\r\nafter, within the limits of their personal ability\r\n\r\nand   scant   financial  resources,  by  socially-conscious  individuals  and  well-meaning  private\r\n\r\norganisations.  Have these underprivileged  people\r\n\r\nbenefited or received any improvements as a result\r\n\r\nof  our  recent  mini-boom? I should  think  their\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  Singapore's present  prosperity\r\n\r\nis,  at  the  most, minimal. With  our  continuing\r\n\r\neconomic progress and the increased $38.25 million\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister for Finance hopes  to  collect\r\n\r\nfrom  increased  taxes, we should  also  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition   to  improve  the  lot  of  the   under-privileged.  I  entirely agree with the  President\r\n\r\nwhen he said that \"everyone must work to earn  and\r\n\r\npay  for  what  he wants in life.\"  Not  everyone,\r\n\r\nhowever, can earn through his own efforts  to  pay\r\n\r\nfor even the bare essentials for his own survival,\r\n\r\nand  such  a  person ought to be assisted  by  the\r\n\r\nState in finding work or other means of living.  I\r\n\r\nam not advocating free services for all, as such a\r\n\r\npolicy may lead to abuse to the detriment of  all.\r\n\r\nWhat I am saying is that the State should pay more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattention  and provide more assistance in  looking\r\n\r\nafter the old destitutes, the chronically ill, the\r\n\r\nmentally  retarded, the blind, the deaf and  dumb,\r\n\r\nby   providing  State-sponsored  facilities  which\r\n\r\nwould  offer them training, education,  recreation\r\n\r\nand a better life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I thank the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance for announcing that the  13th\r\n\r\nmonth payment for the current year will be made in\r\n\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I heard the\r\n\r\nMinister  say  \"the  13th  month.\"  A  14th  month\r\n\r\npayment will be most welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employees of Government and Statutory Boards\r\n\r\nwould  certainly  appreciate the gesture  to  make\r\n\r\nthis  payment  just  before  the  festive  season.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, the last 13th month payment was made\r\n\r\nonly  to those who were in the service during  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  payment.  May I make a  strong  plea  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the employees of the Government and  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards? If we follow the  same  system,\r\n\r\nsome  of  them would not be eligible for the  13th\r\n\r\nmonth payment if the month of their retirement  is\r\n\r\nearlier  than  the month in which the  payment  is\r\n\r\nmade.  In  other words, if he retires in November,\r\n\r\nhe  would not get his December pay. Sir, this 13th\r\n\r\nwage   is  paid  for  services  rendered  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  whether they worked for 12  months  or\r\n\r\nless. If they are compulsorily retired, then  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  paid. In the course of one year,  many\r\n\r\nwould retire, and as such I strongly feel that  in\r\n\r\nthe case of those who leave the service through no\r\n\r\nfault of their own, a proportionate payment should\r\n\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the President's address at  the\r\n\r\nofficial opening of the Third Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech has laid great emphasis on\r\n\r\nthe  necessity to sustain the momentum of economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  achieved in the last five years after  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  has achieved independence and become  an\r\n\r\nautonomous  state.

Everybody should get his reward from his\r\n\r\nown  effort  in  proportion  to  his  ability  and\r\n\r\neffort. Sir, the amplification of this concept  is\r\n\r\nvery  important. It should specially be inculcated\r\n\r\nin  our student population. The reason is that the\r\n\r\nyounger  generation since birth have been enjoying\r\n\r\nfree   medical  care,  comfortable   homes,   free\r\n\r\neducation, and other modern social\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namenities. We should not allow them to  adopt  the\r\n\r\nsyndrome  of enjoying the good things in life  for\r\n\r\nfree.  We should also not allow our people  to  be\r\n\r\nlax  in  their  enthusiasm and  effort  in  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should also remind the people that\r\n\r\nSingapore is not a paradise outside of this world.\r\n\r\nThe  moderate prosperity that we are  enjoying  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that we can be proud of, but we  should\r\n\r\nnot  ho  complacent. Our political  situation  can\r\n\r\nalways   be   affected   by  extraneous   factors.\r\n\r\nFollowing  the normalisation of relations  between\r\n\r\nChina  and  Japan and the assumption of diplomatic\r\n\r\nrelations  between  China and America,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  series  of changes taking  place  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  All these changes will have an  effect  on\r\n\r\nthe  changing scene in Southeast Asia. Our foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  should be formulated step by step, and  it\r\n\r\nshould be modified to keep up with changing times.\r\n\r\nUnless  we  cannot help it, I feel that we  should\r\n\r\nnot  lightly discard our neutral and non-alignment\r\n\r\npolicy in foreign affairs, which has proved to  be\r\n\r\nquite successful up to now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in social development, we know that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  undergoing changes  all  the  time.\r\n\r\nWhether it is in the towns or villages, not a  few\r\n\r\npeople  are  affected by resettlement.  They  have\r\n\r\nestablished   themselves   in   their   respective\r\n\r\nlocalities  for  quite  a  long  time,   and   are\r\n\r\ntherefore,    inconvenienced   by    resettlement.\r\n\r\nHowever, they have to make some sacrifice so  that\r\n\r\nour  country may progress and our economy may also\r\n\r\ndevelop.  Therefore,  it  is  the  duty   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to give special care to these people to\r\n\r\nenable  them to resume their normal livelihood  in\r\n\r\nthe   shortest  possible  time.  It   is   equally\r\n\r\nimportant  for the Government to look  after  them\r\n\r\nduring  or  after  their resettlement.  Where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not done enough for them, I hope it\r\n\r\nwill do better in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is paying equal attention to\r\n\r\nboth  the  urban  areas and the  rural  areas.  In\r\n\r\nrecent  years  the rural folks have been  able  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  taste of modern living, to  have  good\r\n\r\nroads   and   to  enjoy  the  instant  supply   of\r\n\r\nelectricity and water. It cannot be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndenied   that   in  recent  years,   the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department has been giving the  farmers\r\n\r\na  lot  of help. However, because of the technical\r\n\r\naid  and scientific knowledge given by the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department  to  the  farmers,  certain\r\n\r\npeople who are not in the farming business but who\r\n\r\nare well-off have come in to invest in agriculture\r\n\r\nfor profit. This has caused a flux in agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce. In the end the supply is greater than the\r\n\r\ndemand,  and  prices of agricultural produce  fall\r\n\r\nbelow  cost, causing many genuine farmers to  lose\r\n\r\nheavily.  For  instance, in March and  April  this\r\n\r\nyear  the  price of pigs had fallen below average.\r\n\r\nLater  with  a lot of effort by many  people,  the\r\n\r\nprice  of pigs rose. However, that level of  price\r\n\r\ncould not last long. In recent weeks, the price of\r\n\r\npigs  has  fallen steeply again. The  Members  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  and Jalan Kayu mentioned this  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse last week. Obviously, this is not a question\r\n\r\nof over-production, but a question of a deliberate\r\n\r\nmanipulation to suppress prices. So the Government\r\n\r\nshould investigate thoroughly to find some measure\r\n\r\nof  control.  Otherwise, if  the  prices  of  farm\r\n\r\nproduce  keep falling, small farmers will  all  be\r\n\r\nmade bankrupts. Only big farmers may hope to carry\r\n\r\non.  If  this is the care, the price of  pigs  can\r\n\r\nmore  easily be manipulated by a few people.  This\r\n\r\nwill mean that the citizen cannot hope to buy pork\r\n\r\ncheaply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the authorities concerned have been\r\n\r\nregistering the farms for so many years, they must\r\n\r\nbe  quite aware of the conditions existing in  our\r\n\r\nfarms. Therefore, I hope they will make use of the\r\n\r\navailable  data  and, in keeping with  our  entire\r\n\r\ndevelopment    plans,   formulate   a    clear-cut\r\n\r\nagricultural  policy. More important  is  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  try  our best to safeguard the  prices  of\r\n\r\nagricultural produce, to keep them steady so  that\r\n\r\nthe  farmers  may  not  be adversely  affected  by\r\n\r\nfalling prices of agricultural produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years the Government has spent\r\n\r\nmuch  money  on  construction work  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas. But recently it is noticed that many of the\r\n\r\nprojects have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  been  done  satisfactorily. This  has  caused\r\n\r\npeople  to  suspect  whether there  has  been  any\r\n\r\nmalpractices such as the short-supply of materials\r\n\r\nor  short-work of labour. Even in my  constituency\r\n\r\nthere  have been such instances. Take for example,\r\n\r\nthe  metalling of roads. Even before  four  months\r\n\r\nare up, the surface of the road is damaged. On the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of bridges, holes appear on the  surface\r\n\r\nof  bridges before they are several weeks old.  On\r\n\r\npedestrian walks, after repairs have been made  to\r\n\r\nthe  surfaces  they are washed away  by  the  rain\r\n\r\nwithin  three  months and the exposed  gravel  and\r\n\r\nsand make the condition of the surfaces even worse\r\n\r\nthan before. I have reported all these matters  to\r\n\r\nthe  authorities concerned. They are now  awaiting\r\n\r\nrepair  Sir, what needs our attention is the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  all  the  instances of damage  cited  by  me\r\n\r\noccurred  shortly  after  the  projects  had  been\r\n\r\ncompleted. I do not know whether this was  due  to\r\n\r\nmalpractices,     inadequate    supervision     or\r\n\r\nunqualified  contractors. Anyway this would  cause\r\n\r\ninconvenience and more expenditure on repairs.  It\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  so.  I do not  know  whether  the\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned could set up a \"Committee of\r\n\r\nSupervision\"  outside the Public Works  Department\r\n\r\nto strictly supervise every piece of tendered work\r\n\r\nby   contractors   in   order   to   prevent   any\r\n\r\nmalpractices from taking places\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another point which is relevant to\r\n\r\nrural  construction which I would  like  to  raise\r\n\r\nhere.  As  we  all  know, generally  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nprojects   is   estimated  by  the  Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment.   Members  of   Parliament   for   the\r\n\r\nconstituencies   concerned   and   the   Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee members are only  informed\r\n\r\nof  the estimated cost but not the tendered  price\r\n\r\nand actual cost on completion of the project. They\r\n\r\nwill  not  be given satisfactory information  even\r\n\r\nupon  written requests. However, there  are  three\r\n\r\nprices  relating  to  such a project  namely,  the\r\n\r\nestimated price, the tendered price and the actual\r\n\r\ncompleted costs. I am sure they must be different.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the Urban and Rural Services\r\n\r\nCommittee has looked into\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  different  figures.  I  think  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament for the constituencies concerned should\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to know early what the actual  prices\r\n\r\nare  for the completion of those projects and  how\r\n\r\nmuch  money is left, so that before the  financial\r\n\r\nyear  is  up, the Members concerned can carry  out\r\n\r\nmore construction work in their constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, building construction has been very active\r\n\r\nin  our  country. Many satellite towns  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt  one  after the others. This symbolises  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment and progress of a country, and this is\r\n\r\nalso  something which Singapore can be  proud  of.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  is a major fault with  all  these\r\n\r\nsatellite  towns because the authorities concerned\r\n\r\nknow only how to build dwelling accommodation  for\r\n\r\nthe  people  but have overlooked the supplementary\r\n\r\nand necessary facilities such as schools, markets,\r\n\r\nhawker centres, clinics, community centres, sports\r\n\r\nfields,  etc. Because these social amenities  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  provided  in the building  plans,  many\r\n\r\nsocial  problems have arisen relating to  hawkers,\r\n\r\ngangsterism,  and worse, the problem of  education\r\n\r\nwhich  bothers the parents very much.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of schools in the new satellite  towns,\r\n\r\nparents  have  to send their children  to  faraway\r\n\r\nschools.  This  is  both an  inconvenience  and  a\r\n\r\nfinancial   loss.   Sir,  the  Addendum   to   the\r\n\r\nPresident's  speech on the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nmentioned  about the intention of the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nbuild schools in the satellite towns. However, the\r\n\r\nquestion is not to build schools but when to build\r\n\r\nthem, and whether the number will be adequate  for\r\n\r\nthe  need  If schools are built 10 years  after  a\r\n\r\nsatellite   town  is  built,  or  the  number   of\r\n\r\nclassrooms  is  not adequate, it  will  still  not\r\n\r\nsolve the problem of inconvenience to parents. For\r\n\r\ninstance, in Jurong constituency there is only one\r\n\r\nprimary  school  with  a maximum  enrolment.  Last\r\n\r\nmonth,  when registration for Primary I next  year\r\n\r\nwas opened, 500 pupils were enrolled. Luckily, the\r\n\r\nschool   had   earlier  on  built  six   temporary\r\n\r\nclassrooms  so  that  these  new  pupils  can   be\r\n\r\naccommodated.  But, following the  development  of\r\n\r\nJurong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTown,  it  is expected that more Primary I  pupils\r\n\r\nwill  be  enrolled  next  year.  So  how  can   we\r\n\r\naccommodate all these pupils? This is the  problem\r\n\r\nthat   the   Ministry  of  Education  should   pay\r\n\r\nattention to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is the foundation of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding.  In  order to raise the quality  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens, the first thing we must do is  to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  quality of education. This burden  is  mainly\r\n\r\nborne  by  the teachers for they are the ones  who\r\n\r\nactually  implement educational policies. Teachers\r\n\r\nare   mentors  and  exemplars.  They  are  in  the\r\n\r\nforefront or the vanguard of educations. They have\r\n\r\nto  be  cautious in carrying out their duties  and\r\n\r\nshould not fail in what is expected of them by the\r\n\r\nsociety.  Teachers have a duty to impart knowledge\r\n\r\nand  to  exercise  control over the  thinking  and\r\n\r\nconduct  of their students. Because of this  heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility  they  often  become   targets   of\r\n\r\ncriticism by the so-called \"specialists\".  Through\r\n\r\nany  fault of the pupils, all the blame is put  on\r\n\r\nthe teachers. It is not fair. We must realise that\r\n\r\nstudents  attend school either in the  morning  or\r\n\r\nafternoon  for  five  hours  only,  and  for   the\r\n\r\nremaining part of the day they are either at  home\r\n\r\nor  elsewhere. So, to be fair, parents should also\r\n\r\nbear  part of the responsibility of looking  after\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, teachers should respect their profession,\r\n\r\nand  should  also  be contented  with  their  job.\r\n\r\nHowever, under the present circumstances, teachers\r\n\r\ncan respect their profession, but they do not find\r\n\r\nit  easy  to be contented with their job, because,\r\n\r\nother  than  having  to be in step  with  changing\r\n\r\ncurricula  and  having to teach the  normal  daily\r\n\r\nlessons,  many of them have to be responsible  for\r\n\r\ntwo or three kinds of extra-curricular activities.\r\n\r\nSo  how  can we make them happy when there  is  so\r\n\r\nheavy  a  load on them? As for the students,  they\r\n\r\nare  also  hard  pressed with  lessons,  and  they\r\n\r\nstrive  very  hard  in order  to  pass  the  final\r\n\r\nexamination so as to qualify for a certificate. As\r\n\r\nsuch,  they  do not even have time left  to  study\r\n\r\nbooks on extracurricular activities. Studying  has\r\n\r\nbecome\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  hard pursuit for them. We have often heard that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education would lessen the burden\r\n\r\nof  the teachers and the tasks of the students and\r\n\r\nwould  reduce  the teacher-student ratio.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthese promises will not turn out to be castles  in\r\n\r\nthe  air.  I have noted in the Addendum  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education is  going  to  revise  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum.  In actual fact, the contents  of  the\r\n\r\nlessons,  teaching materials and teaching  methods\r\n\r\nwill also have to be reviewed from time to time to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  changing times and needs. In  reviewing\r\n\r\nthem, the authorities concerned should consult the\r\n\r\nteaching profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the new Minister of\r\n\r\nState  for Education, namely, the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nBatok,  in  his  maiden speech has  mentioned  the\r\n\r\neffort made by the Singapore Chinese Middle School\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Union  to promote the learning  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond  language. I may inform the House that  the\r\n\r\nUnion has all along been supporting this bilingual\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  Government. We  hope  to  make  a\r\n\r\ndefinite  contribution towards this end.  We  know\r\n\r\nfor  a  fact that for the survival and development\r\n\r\nof  a  particular ethnic group the  mother  tongue\r\n\r\nembodies  the  cultural tradition,  ethics,  moral\r\n\r\nconcept  and cultural heritage and values of  that\r\n\r\nparticular group. In a prosperous Singapore, it is\r\n\r\nnot  enough to master one's own mother tongue. Our\r\n\r\ncitizens  should  discard  old  shackles  and  old\r\n\r\nconcepts  and  try  to master a language  commonly\r\n\r\nused   in   the  fields  of  technology,  science,\r\n\r\ncommerce  and trade, so as to make it a  means  of\r\n\r\nearning  a  living.  In view  of  this,  we  fully\r\n\r\nsupport the policy of the Ministry of Education to\r\n\r\nencourage all our teachers to be finally bilingual\r\n\r\nIn  this  respect I hope the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\ncan  compile a practical curriculum on the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage for study by those teachers who  want  to\r\n\r\nlearn  it. To start with, principals of integrated\r\n\r\nschools who are not bilingual should be the  first\r\n\r\nto learn a second language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of industrialisation, we have\r\n\r\ncreated  a  lot  of employment opportunities,  but\r\n\r\nvexing  problems have also cropped up as a result.\r\n\r\nOne  of them is air pollution. However, I am  glad\r\n\r\nto  note  that  the Government has set  up  a  new\r\n\r\ndepartment  specially charged  with  environmental\r\n\r\ncontrol.  During the last session  of  Parliament,\r\n\r\nseveral  bills  for the control of  pollution  had\r\n\r\nbeen passed. But we have yet to see the effects of\r\n\r\nenforcement  of these laws. However,  I  have  the\r\n\r\nduty  to  urge  the authorities concerned  to  pay\r\n\r\nattention  to pollution in the largest  industrial\r\n\r\narea  in  our  country, namely  Jurong  Industrial\r\n\r\nTown.  Up  to now, we can still see many factories\r\n\r\nfreely emitting black smoke and burning industrial\r\n\r\nwastes  in  open  ground day and night.  This  has\r\n\r\ncaused the residents to worry because of the  high\r\n\r\nstate of pollution it has reached. The subject  of\r\n\r\npollution is new in our country. The people do not\r\n\r\nhave  an  adequate knowledge about  pollution.  To\r\n\r\nwhat degree will pollution be harmful to man is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  which I think the residents as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe factory owners would like to know. To be fair,\r\n\r\nwe can say that many factory owners are willing to\r\n\r\nabide by the law, as they do not like to be caught\r\n\r\nfor  polluting the air. I do not know whether  the\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned can set up devices to detect\r\n\r\nand to record the degree of pollution at strategic\r\n\r\nplaces,  so  that  all  of us  will  know  whether\r\n\r\npollution of the air has reached a degree as to be\r\n\r\nharmful  to man. These devices can help to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe   worry  of  the  people  affected.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nfactory  owners and the people concerned may  know\r\n\r\nthe  extent of pollution that is present, and that\r\n\r\nproper  control can be exercised. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nAljunied,  at the last sitting of Parliament,  has\r\n\r\nsaid that prevention of air pollution demands  the\r\n\r\neffort  of all our people. But I feel that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that the Government should  be  in  the\r\n\r\nposition to guide and to control. I hope  the  new\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  play its role  in  the  industrial\r\n\r\nareas, particularly in Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion to thank the President\r\n\r\nfor his address,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, 1965 was the year when Singapore\r\n\r\ncreated  history, and the 9th of  August  of  that\r\n\r\nyear  was  an  unforgettable  day.  Many  of   our\r\n\r\nneighbours thought and hoped that this tiny island\r\n\r\ncountry  of ours would perish. But their  thinking\r\n\r\nand schemes were too simple. They forgot to make a\r\n\r\nstudy   of   our   origins  and   our   historical\r\n\r\nbackground; they forgot that we are the progeny of\r\n\r\na  long  and  variegated history, that  we  are  a\r\n\r\npeople endowed with a strong will to struggle  and\r\n\r\na  high  degree  of adaptability and creativeness.\r\n\r\nToday, this tiny country of ours is like a diamond\r\n\r\nshining forth in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the President has pointed out in his speech in\r\n\r\nthis  House  on the 12th October, when  Parliament\r\n\r\nconvened  in  1968 we were faced  with  the  total\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of the British forces and  a  loss  of\r\n\r\n$400  million in revenue together with the serious\r\n\r\nproblem of mass unemployment. Our tasks then  were\r\n\r\nto  promote our economy, to create more jobs,  and\r\n\r\nto  maintain our efforts for a continued survival.\r\n\r\nHowever,  today  we are in a different  situation.\r\n\r\nThere is political stability, economic prosperity,\r\n\r\nand  social  progress. We have become the  \"haves\"\r\n\r\nfrom    \"have-nots\",    and    \"developed\"    from\r\n\r\n\"backwardness\" All this has come about through the\r\n\r\nperennial probing and meticulous planning  of  the\r\n\r\nnational leadership, together with the efforts  of\r\n\r\nthe    whole    populace.   These   results    and\r\n\r\nachievements,  we  should treasure  and  preserve:\r\n\r\nthis  correct plan for the benefit of our  country\r\n\r\nand people, we must follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a developing country, we should note that\r\n\r\nin  a  rapidly  developing  society  if  there  is\r\n\r\nunequal  development  in  certain  areas  and   in\r\n\r\ncertain  strata of the society, i.e.,  classes  or\r\n\r\ngroups  benefiting more than others or some  lower\r\n\r\nclasses not benefiting at all, then such neglected\r\n\r\nclasses  of society will easily become the pockets\r\n\r\nof  dissatisfaction or dropouts in the process  of\r\n\r\nrapid  advancement as they tend to be dispossessed\r\n\r\nof wealth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  position, technique and power, thinking,  and\r\n\r\norganisation. This will naturally make  them  feel\r\n\r\ninsecure, lonely, tense and passive in their daily\r\n\r\nlives,  Sir, between man and man, there are strong\r\n\r\nlinks  such  as  the brotherhood of  man  and  the\r\n\r\nability   to   co-operate.   When   our   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  reaches a certain point  of  success,\r\n\r\nwhere   social  environment  permits,  we   should\r\n\r\nassist,  guide  and care more for the  unfortunate\r\n\r\ndropouts  of the present society, so as to  enable\r\n\r\nthem to advance with the rest of us, to think  and\r\n\r\nto  enjoy the fruits of prosperity, to breathe the\r\n\r\nfresh  air of the new society and to have a  sense\r\n\r\nof  security.  We must enable all  the  people  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  as  the  country  develops,  politically,\r\n\r\neconomically and culturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from each according to his ability, to each\r\n\r\naccording   to  his  need.  Under  our  democratic\r\n\r\nsocialist  system, every citizen can  enjoy  equal\r\n\r\nopportunity and rights, so that everything may  be\r\n\r\nfully  utilised  for the speediest advancement  of\r\n\r\nthe society. This is correct. However, we must not\r\n\r\nover-emphasise or encourage everyone to go up,  as\r\n\r\nthis  will  lead to keen competition between  men,\r\n\r\nand  in  a  competitive society the  victors  will\r\n\r\nbecome the cream of the society, monopolising  all\r\n\r\nthe   values  of  the  society  such  as   wealth,\r\n\r\nposition, fame and power. This will dissipate  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of joint effort and collectivism. In its\r\n\r\nplace  there  will  be competitive  individualism.\r\n\r\nThis  will  cause more people to fail  and  to  be\r\n\r\nfrustrated, leading to inferiority complex and the\r\n\r\nloss  of  courage and joy to live.  Sir,  to  lose\r\n\r\none's  aim  in  life  is to  cut  one  loose  from\r\n\r\nsociety, thus making one lose faith in life and in\r\n\r\nsocial mores. It will lead to self-abandonment, to\r\n\r\nthe  commission of crimes, and to the  development\r\n\r\nof  a  peculiar  mode  of living,  thus  enhancing\r\n\r\nsocial  burden and pollution of the society.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  newly established Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nfor  the prevention of pollution brought about  by\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  can use  effective  devices  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  direct material  pollution  of  air,\r\n\r\nwater  and  noise. But pollutions of the  society,\r\n\r\nthe spirit, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthought cannot be solved by material means  or  in\r\n\r\nthe space of a very short time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, urban renewal for the better utilisation of\r\n\r\nland  to increase national economic resources  and\r\n\r\nto  promote the prosperity of the urban areas  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  forms of national development.  But  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  concerned  about profiteering  by  big\r\n\r\ngroups  of  private developers, which  has  caused\r\n\r\ntremendous increases in land prices. As a  result,\r\n\r\nour  medium  and  small traders are  hit  by  high\r\n\r\nrentals  and they are either forced to close  down\r\n\r\nor  to  be  swallowed up by big enterprises.  This\r\n\r\ncauses  more wealth and property to be  controlled\r\n\r\nby  the few, and pauperizing the majority. This is\r\n\r\nunfair.  Sir,  owing  to our political  stability,\r\n\r\nincreasing   population,   rapid   expansion    of\r\n\r\nindustries, prospering urban economy, in  addition\r\n\r\nto   the   influx  of  foreign  capital  and   oil\r\n\r\nexploration around the seas in Southeast Asia with\r\n\r\nSingapore as the base, our economy is enjoying  an\r\n\r\nunprecedented  booms This has  also  caused  rapid\r\n\r\nincreases in the prices of properties, houses, and\r\n\r\nland.  Over  the last three or four  years  prices\r\n\r\nhave  increased  by  300 or  400  per  cent,  thus\r\n\r\ncreating  a boom in the building trade and  giving\r\n\r\nrise  to  a  dearth of building materials  and  of\r\n\r\nskilled  and unskilled workers. Sir,  we  want  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  and  progress, but we should never  allow\r\n\r\nany  one industry to over-develop at a pace  which\r\n\r\nthe  other  industries cannot catch  up  with.  We\r\n\r\nshould  have  proper  control  over  the  building\r\n\r\nindustry  anti  a  better allocation  of  building\r\n\r\nunits  after we have made a thorough study of  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  public and private  housing  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber of units to be built per year. In this way,\r\n\r\nwe  shall  be  able  to co-ordinate  our  building\r\n\r\nworkers, advanced technology and machinery, so  as\r\n\r\nto  speed up the building of an adequate number of\r\n\r\npublic fiats.

Generally,\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  of \"Home for the Dwellers\"  has  been\r\n\r\nwell  received by people in the middle  and  lower\r\n\r\nstrata.  As the population in the urban  areas  is\r\n\r\ntoo  concentrated,  there should  be  better  land\r\n\r\nutilisation of some empty State land and  of  land\r\n\r\noccupied by old and low-level Government servants'\r\n\r\nquarters, which take up much space. In their place\r\n\r\nwe  should  build more high-rise public  flats  to\r\n\r\nimprove the residential environment of the workers\r\n\r\nand people of the middle and lower strata in those\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention should be paid not only to the building\r\n\r\nof  so-called high-class shopping centres  in  the\r\n\r\ncity  area,  but  we  should also  understand  the\r\n\r\nbackground  of and the actual needs of our  people\r\n\r\nWhen the cost of living is rising day by day, will\r\n\r\nmost  families  with more than  four  children  to\r\n\r\nbring up (unlike in the West where a family seldom\r\n\r\nhas  more  than four children), have  any  surplus\r\n\r\nmoney  to  buy the so-called high-class  articles?\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am not against the building of high-class\r\n\r\nshopping  centres under the urban renewal  scheme,\r\n\r\nbut  1  would  like to stress that we  should  not\r\n\r\nbuild  too many modern shopping centres  in  close\r\n\r\nproximity  in  too short a time. As  they  do  not\r\n\r\nserve the actual needs of our people, they have no\r\n\r\nbusiness.  In the end, many of our local merchants\r\n\r\nwho  have  moved  into these new shopping  centres\r\n\r\nhave  to  close down because of poor business  and\r\n\r\nbecause  of rising prices of properties  owing  to\r\n\r\nimpending   urban  renewal.  Sir,  the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments concerned should make a study  of  the\r\n\r\nincome and living conditions of the people in  the\r\n\r\nlocality  concerned, before setting up  plans  for\r\n\r\ncommercial centres to meet the daily needs and the\r\n\r\npractical  demands  of  the  people  in  order  to\r\n\r\npromote prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the saying goes: \"to start an enterprise\r\n\r\nis  difficult, to maintain an enterprise  is  even\r\n\r\nmore difficult.\" Through our Constitution, we will\r\n\r\npreserve the independence and sovereignty  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of  Singapore.

Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbold  and tough policies firmly implemented  since\r\n\r\n1965,  and the intelligent response of the  people\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  collective disciplined  work,  have\r\n\r\nenabled  us  to  overcome the  stark  question  of\r\n\r\nsurvival as an independent nation, so much so that\r\n\r\nwe should now be able to have a closer look at the\r\n\r\nfundamentals  of  the  social  doctrine  that   is\r\n\r\nshaping  the  nation. The President's  Speech  has\r\n\r\nvery   properly  raised  the  question  of   these\r\n\r\nfundamentals  in terms principally  of  the  work-ethic  and remuneration for such work that  should\r\n\r\nbe instilled into the people. While the Speech has\r\n\r\nsuggested   the  broad  generalisations   of   the\r\n\r\nemergent doctrine, it will be for this House  over\r\n\r\nthe  ensuing years to help in analysing  the  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  and  recondite  elements  of  the   new\r\n\r\ndoctrine  in terms, in particular, of  the  social\r\n\r\nconsequences that it generates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been our supreme virtue in the past not to\r\n\r\nbe   dogmatic  and  doctrinaire  in   social   and\r\n\r\npolitical matters. This has enabled us, in holding\r\n\r\nfast  to  the  central objectives  of  building  a\r\n\r\nrational and just social order, to experiment with\r\n\r\ndifferent  methods designed both to create  wealth\r\n\r\nand  to  generate  a  credible defence  capability\r\n\r\nwithin the short time-span\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\navailable  to us. So, while other  countries\r\n\r\nhave  moved  backwards into the future by  playing\r\n\r\naround   with  emotive  and  immaterial  questions\r\n\r\nrelating  to  language,  neo-colonialism  and  the\r\n\r\nlike, we have taken small but steady steps forward\r\n\r\ninto the same future. In a fast changing turbulent\r\n\r\narea,  we would, for the next five years at least,\r\n\r\nconstitute a stable anchor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having wiped out unemployment, we now move on to\r\n\r\nthe  next  phase of our development in  which  the\r\n\r\nprovision of a higher standard and quality of life\r\n\r\nfor  all  would assume increasing importance.  The\r\n\r\nphenomenon  of rising expectations  is  an  unruly\r\n\r\nhorse  in any system of democratic politics. There\r\n\r\nwould   be  measured  wage  increases  and   vexed\r\n\r\nquestions relating to the criteria to be  employed\r\n\r\nin  establishing wage differentials. The procedure\r\n\r\nof  achieving mathematical parities in  wages  for\r\n\r\ndifferent  types  of  work in  industry  need  not\r\n\r\ndetain us if it is recognised that \"in some  small\r\n\r\ndegree  the standard of life of the great mass  of\r\n\r\nthe  nation depends not merely on the remuneration\r\n\r\nwhich  they are paid for their labour, but on  the\r\n\r\nsocial income which they receive as citizens\".  In\r\n\r\nthis context the prospect of massive investment in\r\n\r\nthe  education and health of the nation is welcome\r\n\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If then it is also assumed that a clear principle\r\n\r\nof  demarcation should divide the needs which  may\r\n\r\nproperly  be  supplied by collective  action  from\r\n\r\nthose  which humans should be required to meet  by\r\n\r\ntheir personal exertions, the aim of policy should\r\n\r\nbe   to   create   the  pre-conditions   and   the\r\n\r\nenvironment that would provide the incentives  for\r\n\r\nthe citizen to maximise his personal exertions  in\r\n\r\nproviding for his needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really implied in this, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  a social system where work and remuneration is\r\n\r\nbased  not  on  status but on contract,  with  the\r\n\r\nstate  stepping  in from time to time  to  correct\r\n\r\ninjustices that fail to be solved by the two sides\r\n\r\nof  industry - management and labour. In this  way\r\n\r\nthe  work-ethic, so necessary for the regeneration\r\n\r\nof a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping  nation, would remain  unimpaired.  The\r\n\r\ncall  has already been made recently outside  this\r\n\r\nChamber  for the inspired creation of  a  profound\r\n\r\nethic  in  industry  that  would  obliterate   the\r\n\r\ndifferences  and  distinctions between  management\r\n\r\nand  labour  and provide the solvent for  wasteful\r\n\r\nperiodic  industrial  strife  and  discord.  While\r\n\r\nlegislation   in  the  shape  of  the   Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Act has provided the essential machinery\r\n\r\nfor  conciliation  and  arbitration  o  industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes,  it has failed, as it must,  to  provide\r\n\r\nthe  self-adjusting  social mechanism  that  would\r\n\r\nminimise, if not, eradicate differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is needed is the evolution in industrial\r\n\r\npractice in Singapore of a new value of,  if  need\r\n\r\nbe,  non-political  mutualism  that  would  enable\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  labour to work  as  partners,  as\r\n\r\nopposed   to  antagonistic  factors  in  industry.\r\n\r\nDifferent  experiments to  achieve  this  end  are\r\n\r\nbeing  conducted, with varying degrees of  success\r\n\r\nand  failure, the world over. But it may be useful\r\n\r\nfor  us in Singapore to have a closer look at  the\r\n\r\nprinciples and values that govern the organisation\r\n\r\nand   functioning  of  industry   in   Japan.   If\r\n\r\npaternalistic, Japanese industry appears to fulfil\r\n\r\nthe    duties   and   responsibilities   of   that\r\n\r\npaternalism  by  securing  the  welfare   of   its\r\n\r\nemployees  over  and  above  the  monetary  income\r\n\r\nearned by them. It has in this way taken over some\r\n\r\nof  the functions performed in other countries  by\r\n\r\nthe  state.  If I may say so, we may have  reached\r\n\r\nthe  right  stage  in our political  and  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment to work some of the rudimentary values\r\n\r\nof   the   Japanese  system  into  our  industrial\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the social unit of modern Western society is\r\n\r\nthe individual, the social unit of Eastern society\r\n\r\nhas  always  been  the  family.  These  two  basic\r\n\r\npremises  produce  entirely  different  types   of\r\n\r\nsocial   systems   and  duties.  The   astonishing\r\n\r\nphenomenon  that  emerges  in  any  study  of  the\r\n\r\nhistory of Eastern societies is the vast stretches\r\n\r\nof time over which these societies have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nendured  and  developed without final  dissolution\r\n\r\nand  disappearance; and I believe that one of  the\r\n\r\nreasons for this is the strength and integrity  of\r\n\r\nthe  family system. We must quickly decide now  if\r\n\r\nthe  social  unit in Singapore is  to  remain  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  or  if we are to go the way of  the  West\r\n\r\nwith everything that that implies; for any perusal\r\n\r\nof  the  daily newspapers would indicate that  our\r\n\r\nfamilies  are  breaking-up  and  terms  like   the\r\n\r\ngeneration   gap,  fashionable  in   some   exotic\r\n\r\nsocieties of the West, seem to be the current coin\r\n\r\nin  discussions in Singapore as well.  The  causes\r\n\r\nand  reasons  for  the break-up  of  our  families\r\n\r\nshould   be  properly  studied  before  we   start\r\n\r\nborrowing  descriptive and quasi-scientific  terms\r\n\r\nfrom foreign theorists wholely inapplicable to our\r\n\r\nsituation; and in this context it may be useful to\r\n\r\nreview  the working of the Women's Charter to  see\r\n\r\nif  it has been an unmitigated success; if it  has\r\n\r\nsecured the woman, discipline the man and save the\r\n\r\nhome.  I am sure that any such investigation would\r\n\r\nreveal some interesting and unsuspected phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past ten years we have\r\n\r\nmoved  and  gently swung Singapore from  stage  to\r\n\r\nstage   in  her  political,  economic  and  social\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  and  the area and distance  that  we\r\n\r\nhave traversed as a people in this decade has been\r\n\r\nlittle  short of revolutionary. This  passage  has\r\n\r\nbeen achieved not through the barrel of the gun to\r\n\r\nthe  chagrin  of one school of our opponents, but\r\n\r\nthrough the ballot-box to the chagrin again  of  a\r\n\r\nfew other schools of our opponents; and we had the\r\n\r\nopportunity   recently  to  test  their   relative\r\n\r\nstrengths among the people. That they have  failed\r\n\r\nmiserably  is not surprising, for the people  were\r\n\r\nable to see through the simple scheme of fallacies\r\n\r\nprojected  by the opposition parties, and  we  now\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  people  have  advanced  in  their\r\n\r\nconsciousness  far  beyond  the  understanding  of\r\n\r\nthese opposition groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next decade will see us securing ourselves in\r\n\r\nthe emergent Southeast Asian state system and,  in\r\n\r\nthe  course of it, it may be necessary for us from\r\n\r\ntime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto time to swing Singapore gently from one course\r\n\r\nto the other depending upon the tide of the times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
