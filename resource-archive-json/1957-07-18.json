Everybody knows about what is going  on\r\n\r\nand  nothing is being done about it. This is partly\r\n\r\nbecause  the law with regard to corrupt  practices,\r\n\r\nas  laid down in our Elections Ordinance, is copied\r\n\r\nfrom  the  English law. Although those  laws  would\r\n\r\nadequately   protect  society  from   the   corrupt\r\n\r\npolitician  under  English social conditions,  they\r\n\r\nare  completely inadequate to deal with the totally\r\n\r\ndifferent social conditions obtaining in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  by-elections led to a great number of  charges\r\n\r\nand  counter-charges of strong-arm methods, illegal\r\n\r\nmethods, corrupt methods, but no election candidate\r\n\r\nhas   filed   an  election  petition  against   his\r\n\r\nopponents,  nor indeed has anyone made any  serious\r\n\r\ncomplaint  to the police. All this adds up  to  the\r\n\r\nfact that unless we radically alter our approach to\r\n\r\ncorrupt  practices, then in the next elections  and\r\n\r\nthe  elections  succeeding we will find  all  these\r\n\r\nhigh-handed methods getting completely out of hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the by-elections opened, a luncheon was\r\n\r\nthrown at a fashionable hotel in Singapore at which\r\n\r\nthe  two candidates of the Liberal-Socialist  Party\r\n\r\naddressed  certain  journalists  who  were  invited\r\n\r\nspecifically  for  the  purpose  of  boosting   the\r\n\r\nelection campaign of these two candidates. This  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the Straits Times of Saturday, June the 8th - a\r\n\r\npaper  well-advised as to the law of libel  because\r\n\r\none of its directors is a senior member of the Bar,\r\n\r\nand  therefore very careful not to publish anything\r\n\r\nthat would have made them liable to damages, and if\r\n\r\nthis is not true, it definitely is defamatory - said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At a by-election campaign luncheon in Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  will  not figure on the candidate's  expense\r\n\r\nsheet,  the  talk  turned to the  value  of  public\r\n\r\nmeetings and a candidate's speeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Don't bother about meetings and speeches', said\r\n\r\nthe   candidate's   adviser.   'They'll   get   you\r\n\r\nnowwhere.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I know', said the candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Get the secret society boys out', said the\r\n\r\nadviser. 'They'll do it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I know', said the candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody at the lunch heard. Everybody would\r\n\r\ndeny it if names were mentioned. Or they might  say\r\n\r\nit  was  all a joke. But it wasn't a joke, and  the\r\n\r\nsecret society boys have been called out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr 'X' isn't the first budding politician to summon the secret societies' aid. He may get in.\r\n\r\nBut not if voters keep their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elections Ordinance provides penalties for\r\n\r\nthe  person who directly or indirectly, by  himself\r\n\r\nor  by any other person on his behalf, makes use of\r\n\r\nor  threatens to make use of any force, violence or\r\n\r\nrestraint, or inflicts or threatens to inflict,  by\r\n\r\nhimself  or  any  other  person,  any  temporal  or\r\n\r\nspiritual injury, damage, harm or loss in order  to\r\n\r\ninfluence an elector in voting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words, words, almost meaningless words to the\r\n\r\naverage voter. All he need remember is that no  one\r\n\r\nwill ever know how he votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been talk of corruption. Not one\r\n\r\ncomplaint of corruption, however, has been made  to\r\n\r\nthe police, by a candidate or by anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there are some witnesses in this House\r\n\r\nwho  were present at that particular luncheon.  The\r\n\r\nadviser  who said these things was also a candidate\r\n\r\nin  the  last  general elections. He  said  openly,\r\n\r\nalbeit  in jest, that he spent no less than $60,000\r\n\r\nin  the  last elections. He calculated that by  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of votes he collected, it cost him no  less\r\n\r\nthan  $600  per vote. Now, Sir, certain things  one\r\n\r\ncan  jest  about, but when things come to  a  stage\r\n\r\nwhere  one  openly  calls a  press  conference  and\r\n\r\nbandies  these ideas about, then something must  be\r\n\r\ndone about it or we will perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no law which says that a corrupt man\r\n\r\ncannot stand for election. If a man is prepared  to\r\n\r\nadopt  corrupt practices to get into the  Assembly,\r\n\r\nit  is  more than likely that he will continue  his\r\n\r\ncorrupt  practices after he has been  elected,  and\r\n\r\nnothing  is more certain to destroy the democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  of government than corrupt politicians.  If\r\n\r\nyour Minister is corrupt, your Permanent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary  will  also be corrupt in  a  very  short\r\n\r\nwhile. Your Principal Assistant Secretary will also\r\n\r\ntake  something for himself. Your clerks will  take\r\n\r\nsomething for themselves and finally the  peon  may\r\n\r\nnot want to deliver a letter unless you give him 50\r\n\r\ncents with every letter. When that comes about, the\r\n\r\nwhole administrative system on which the democratic\r\n\r\nmachinery  rests will sag and collapse. That  would\r\n\r\nbe the end of the works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Shakespeare when he wrote Hamlet wrote one\r\n\r\nof  the greatest tragedies in the world, but if you\r\n\r\nget  Hamlet enacted by the kind of actors  we  have\r\n\r\nseen in the last elections, then it is going to  be\r\n\r\na farce. However good the democratic system, if the\r\n\r\ndramatis  personae consist of clowns,  buffoons  and\r\n\r\nnincompoops, it must fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I would like Members on the other side\r\n\r\nof  the House not to be so jubilant because  I  may\r\n\r\nhave  something to say about one or  two  of  their\r\n\r\ncolleagues.  In  case it is  said  that  I  am  now\r\n\r\nbecoming  pro-Labour Front, let me read about  what\r\n\r\none   of   the  Members  opposite  may  have   been\r\n\r\nresponsible  for.  \"The  Mak  Brothers\"  says   the\r\n\r\nStraits Times. They are from Singapore and not from\r\n\r\nHollywood.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nmore  delightful aspects of improper practices  but\r\n\r\nthis  is not against the law and if people want  to\r\n\r\nresort  to such tactics to their own detriment,  it\r\n\r\nis  entirely  their business. I would not  like  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  what I know happened because that might  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  to be biased but the Straits  Times  of\r\n\r\nJune 27 reported it in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr C.

This is where we come from the sublime down to\r\n\r\nthe earth:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The younger Mr Mak, before addressing the\r\n\r\ngathering  in Cantonese, Malay, Hindi and  English,\r\n\r\nentertained his listeners for about 10  minutes  by\r\n\r\nplaying  popular Chinese tunes on his harmonica  [a\r\n\r\nmost worthwile occupation].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd, in a happy mood, then gave Mr Koh a\r\n\r\ntremendous ovation when he told them...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another bit about Mr Mak Pak Shee\r\n\r\n(the  Member  for Geylang) explaining  why  he  was\r\n\r\nthere  and what he was doing. We are not interested\r\n\r\nin  that  but  all  this is quite  delightful.  One\r\n\r\nperson  watching  this  man playing  the  accordion\r\n\r\nsaid:   \"Thank   God  he  can  only   squeeze   the\r\n\r\nconcertina!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that was not illegal. But when\r\n\r\nwe  are  told that some of the voters were  offered\r\n\r\nseven  dollars and five dollars for  a  vote,  that\r\n\r\nbecomes  very serious. Our law, as I have said,  is\r\n\r\ncopied  from  the  English law which  is  effective\r\n\r\nunder  English social conditions where people  will\r\n\r\ngive  evidence and denounce others in  open  court.\r\n\r\nHere  it is impossible. Unless we give witnesses  a\r\n\r\nguarantee of secrecy, it is impossible to get these\r\n\r\npeople  to  come forward in court. For instance,  I\r\n\r\nhave  a  little account book here which has a  very\r\n\r\nclose  connection with one of the Mak brothers.  It\r\n\r\nrecords the tea drunk and the cigarettes smoked  by\r\n\r\nabout 10 or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12  so-called  helpers during the election  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of this hon. gentleman.

Therefore I  cannot\r\n\r\nprove that an offence has been committed by Mr  C.\r\n\r\nH.  Koh. But if an Inquiry Commission were  set  up\r\n\r\nwhich is not confined to the technicalities of  the\r\n\r\ncriminal  law of corruption, then some  astonishing\r\n\r\ndisclosures could take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the middle of the by-election campaign, a canvasser who was going round\r\n\r\nsinging  the  democratic virtues  of  the  Liberal-Socialist    candidate    in    Cairnhill - i    hope\r\n\r\njustifiably - was stabbed at the Esplanade.  That  is\r\n\r\nnot   by   itself  a  very  serious  thing  because\r\n\r\ncanvassers may have made mortal enemies  on  issues\r\n\r\nother than the by-election, but says this canvasser\r\n\r\nwho  was stabbed, as reported in the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nof 18th June:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n\r\n<br>\"'MY ASSAILANTS WARNED ME NOT TO WORK FOR SOH'<br>\r\n\r\nTIP ON MEN WHO BEAT LIB-SOC<br>\r\n\r\n'KNOWN GANGSTER' LED THE FOUR THUGS WHO HIT <br>\r\n\r\nBY-ELECTION CANVASSER ON HEAD<br>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A known Singapore secret society gangster is said\r\n\r\nto  have  led  the four-man gang which assaulted  a\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist vote canvasser, Mr Rahim Sattar,\r\n\r\nearly on Saturday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police yesterday received information about the\r\n\r\ngang - two Chinese, an Indian and a Malay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No arrests have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police investigators are working on a report by\r\n\r\nMr  Sattar  that he was assaulted because  he  was\r\n\r\ncanvassing votes for Mr Soh Ghee Soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the General Hospital, Mr Sattar, who is\r\n\r\nrecovering from head injuries believed to have been\r\n\r\ninflicted by a hockey stick, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I know my assailants.

I am sending no  condolences  to\r\n\r\nanybody who makes such allegations. But that is not\r\n\r\nall. On Thursday, June 27, an analytical account of\r\n\r\nthe  whole by-elections was written up by a serious\r\n\r\npolitical commentator in the Straits Times. He said\r\n\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But by and large the electors of Cairnhill have\r\n\r\nbeen  apathetic.  At  one meeting  in  Cairnhill  a\r\n\r\nsizeable proportion of the small crowd was made  up\r\n\r\nof young men sporting gay trousers, shirts and Tony\r\n\r\nCurtis  hair-cuts. Half-way through the  meeting  I\r\n\r\nwitnessed  the arrival of some eight or nine  cases\r\n\r\nof  soft drinks which were liberally passed  around\r\n\r\nto  these  gay  young  men who by  their  demeanour\r\n\r\nshowed  that they appreciated the drinks more  than\r\n\r\nthey did the trickle of oratory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a law about giving\r\n\r\npeople,  voters and others drinks. And  in  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar, they had the audacity not only to give  soft\r\n\r\ndrinks  but cakes as well to accompany the  drinks,\r\n\r\nat   a  public  meeting!  There  were  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nwitnesses.  But at a public forum I could  not  get\r\n\r\nanyone  to  give evidence who could  establish  the\r\n\r\nlink  between the candidate and the drinks and  the\r\n\r\ncakes. It is not because we have been successful in\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar that we have done nothing about  it.\r\n\r\nWe  are against this on principle. Either we  stamp\r\n\r\nout these practices or there will be bedlam. In the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncloistered  atmosphere  of  a  court  such  as  the\r\n\r\nCommission on Corruption, or a court of enquiry  or\r\n\r\nsome tribunal not hamstrung by the strict rules  of\r\n\r\nthe  law  of evidence, a great deal of corrupt  and\r\n\r\nimproper practices can be brought to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we in this Assembly, to be\r\n\r\nquite  honest and frank with every Member  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse, are just a flash in the pan in the evolution\r\n\r\nof  the constitutional process in Singapore and  in\r\n\r\nMalaya.  If  in  the  next elections  all  that  we\r\n\r\nsucceed in doing is to multiply 25 elected English-educated  opportunists, buccaneers and  adventurers\r\n\r\nby  two, to make 51, not only English-educated, but\r\n\r\nChinese-educated,   Malay-educated   and    Indian-educated  buccaneers, adventurers and crooks,  then\r\n\r\nthe  outcome  must  be the end  of  the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem as we intend it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is possible in Singapore, or in\r\n\r\nMalaya,   to  adopt  Western  values  and  practice\r\n\r\nwholesale.  We  can adopt certain principles  which\r\n\r\nare good, but the mechanics have to be altered. For\r\n\r\ninstance, no candidate in England is allowed to put\r\n\r\na  symbol besides his name. No candidate is allowed\r\n\r\nto put his party emblem. If a man is a candidate he\r\n\r\noffers himself to his electorate. Here we have  had\r\n\r\nto adopt a different method; we allow party symbols\r\n\r\nby the side of a candidate's name. The whole of the\r\n\r\nlaw  relating to corrupt and improper practices  is\r\n\r\ncompletely  unsuitable to our  conditions,  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot bring the crooks to book with these laws.  A\r\n\r\ncommission  must be set up to think  out  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans by which we can prevent the democratic system\r\n\r\nfrom    being   subverted   by   these    political\r\n\r\nadventurers. We have a few ideas as to how they can\r\n\r\nbe  effectively  detected, punished and  suppressed\r\n\r\nbut  this is not perhaps the forum for giving these\r\n\r\nideas. However, if a proper tribunal is set up,  we\r\n\r\nwill have some recommendations to put forward as to\r\n\r\nhow in future we can stop these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I think I shall be safe in\r\n\r\nsaying  that  all hon.

I\r\n\r\nunderstand that Members on my side of the House and\r\n\r\non   the  other  side  will  have  other  ideas  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the theme I have chosen  for  debate\r\n\r\ntoday, but I ask them to remember that if they  are\r\n\r\nserious  about the future of the democratic  system\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, in Malaya - and I repeat - you can  have\r\n\r\nthe  best  system in the world but if you  put  the\r\n\r\nlousiest  of  men  to  work that  system,  it  will\r\n\r\ncollapse! If you get Mr Mak Pak Shee to  play  the\r\n\r\nPrince  of Denmark then even Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\"\r\n\r\nwill become a farce!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.35 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  rise to second  the  motion  and\r\n\r\nreserve my right to speak at a later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.37 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I rise to support the motion and I know there\r\n\r\nwill be enthusiastic support from all other Members\r\n\r\nof  this House for this motion. This is only to  be\r\n\r\nexpected, Sir, since the elections efforts  of  all\r\n\r\nof  us  should be able to stand the enquiry of  the\r\n\r\nCommission  on Corrupt Practices. I shall  be  most\r\n\r\nsurprised if they do not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not overlook the fact, Sir, that both\r\n\r\nduring   and  after  elections  there  are   strong\r\n\r\nallegations  about  the  conduct  of  a  number  of\r\n\r\nsuccessful candidates and unsuccessful ones.  These\r\n\r\nrumours  may  be unfounded, but on the  other  hand\r\n\r\nthey  may be true. Some of these stories, Sir,  are\r\n\r\nstill  persistent and universally known,  and  they\r\n\r\nmerit investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly struck by the fact that the\r\n\r\nnames of certain local politicians crop up whenever\r\n\r\nstories of corruption are recounted. There  may  be\r\n\r\ngood reasons why these names are almost universally\r\n\r\nassociated  with corruption. No doubt,  Sir,  these\r\n\r\ngentlemen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  be  unjustly  accused. Their association  with\r\n\r\nsecret  society  gangsters may be quite  simple  to\r\n\r\nexplain.  They  may  be  mixing  with  such   shady\r\n\r\ncharacters with the good intention of rescuing them\r\n\r\nfrom crime. But investigation of these stories will\r\n\r\ndo  much to clear the good name or confirm the  bad\r\n\r\nreputation  of  some political  leaders.  If  these\r\n\r\nrumours  are  true  or  even half  true,  then  the\r\n\r\nconditions  of  honest  democratic  government  are\r\n\r\nbeing seriously threatened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at the moment, Sir, conducting\r\n\r\ninvestigations  into allegations of  corruption  in\r\n\r\nGovernment departments. These are only allegations,\r\n\r\nyet the Government has quite rightly taken the view\r\n\r\nthat the integrity of the Civil Service is so vital\r\n\r\nto  good government that even allegations are worth\r\n\r\ninvestigating.   So  if  there  are   stories   and\r\n\r\npersistent  allegations of  improper  practices  by\r\n\r\nelection  candidates and their camp followers,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should be no less ready  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nCommission on Corrupt Practices to enquire into the\r\n\r\nsuspicious behaviour of those who aspire  to  seize\r\n\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every election brings its quota of improper\r\n\r\npractices. For example, Sir, it is not unusual  for\r\n\r\na  candidate to claim that either he or his helpers\r\n\r\nhave  been set upon by thugs. I believe such claims\r\n\r\nwere made in the latest by-election and also in the\r\n\r\nlast  general election. It is also true, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nsome  candidates  call to their assistance  helpers\r\n\r\nwho  look  like thugs. Until the election  campaign\r\n\r\nstarts,  these  people never show  an  interest  in\r\n\r\npolitics or in the fate of democracy. Suddenly they\r\n\r\nare found signing the pages of democracy, or rather\r\n\r\nthat  of  candidates  who  presumably  claimed   to\r\n\r\npersonify  democracy. Some of these  gentlemen  who\r\n\r\nfailed  were  the desperate-looking candidates  who\r\n\r\nenjoyed   an  island-wide  reputation  of   knowing\r\n\r\ngangsters  who  for a price would let  loose  their\r\n\r\nstrong-arm  boys  among the  electors.  In  fact  a\r\n\r\nColonial  Officer, Mr Blythe, who is an expert  on\r\n\r\nsecret  societies, not so long ago  warned  of  the\r\n\r\nreal  danger of secret society thugs being used  by\r\n\r\npoliticians for election purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this, Sir, I maintain that it will\r\n\r\nbe  in  the public interest and in the interest  of\r\n\r\ngood government if the terms of the Commission were\r\n\r\nextended  to  include political  corruption. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.41 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nallegations of malpractices have always  been  made\r\n\r\nafter  all  elections, and especially so after  the\r\n\r\nrecent  by-elections. I have observed that whenever\r\n\r\na  candidate in an election finds things not  going\r\n\r\nhis  way,  he  makes  a lot of allegations  against\r\n\r\nother candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent by-election, I was not involved\r\n\r\npersonally,  and  I can therefore speak  with  less\r\n\r\nbias.   We   have  heard  persistent   charges   of\r\n\r\nmalpractices.  At  election  rallies,  bottles   of\r\n\r\n\"Green  Spot\" were given out freely by students  or\r\n\r\npeople who should be students. But nobody will  say\r\n\r\nwho were these people who passed the drinks around.\r\n\r\nNobody  would  say so because they were  afraid  of\r\n\r\nretaliation; there is insidious intimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know, too, Sir, that before a political rally\r\n\r\ntakes  place some Parties usually staged \"picnics\";\r\n\r\nthe gatherings would then move on to the rally. Who\r\n\r\npaid  for  those  \"picnics\" which were  so  greatly\r\n\r\nenjoyed   by  those  who  attended  and  at   which\r\n\r\npolitical  speeches with a lot of  flame  and  fire\r\n\r\nwere made?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J.

That is connected\r\n\r\nwith the Mak brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could see that these \"picnics\" were not\r\n\r\ngenuine   social  events  but  indoctrination   and\r\n\r\nelectioneering gatherings at which the  virtues  of\r\n\r\nthe  candidate of one Party were extolled  and  mud\r\n\r\nthrown  at  other  Parties. The  accounts  of  such\r\n\r\npicnics  are  many and we ourselves have  witnessed\r\n\r\nlorry-loads of youths going to such quiet places as\r\n\r\nTampenis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There were no elections in\r\n\r\nTampenis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> There were no elections\r\n\r\nthere,  but  invariably all those who attended  the\r\n\r\n\"picnics\"  in  those places were later  brought  to\r\n\r\nelection   rallies.

I will\r\n\r\ninstance  a  few  more  cases  for  this  House  to\r\n\r\nconsider. In an election rally which is democratic,\r\n\r\nevery candidate should be allowed his say, and  the\r\n\r\npeople  should be allowed to listen to what he  has\r\n\r\nto  tell and offer them. I was present at one rally\r\n\r\nbut half-way through it I heard a loud noise coming\r\n\r\nfrom  a  side  street with shouts  like,  \"Oom-pah!\r\n\r\nMerdeka!\"  The  voices  were  in  unison,   Sir, - in\r\n\r\nunison.  And  I  saw about a thousand-strong  young\r\n\r\npeople approaching the election rally, which was in\r\n\r\nSmith  Street,  apparently with  the  intention  of\r\n\r\nbreaking  it up. Was that not force, Sir? Was  that\r\n\r\nnot  intimidation? Was that not a very undemocratic\r\n\r\nway of preventing a rival candidate from having his\r\n\r\nsay? I deplore this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the leader of the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty, the one well versed in law and who has had a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of political education, will say,  \"Oh,\r\n\r\nbut  these boys were not connected with us. It only\r\n\r\nso  happens  they were there.\" Sir,  that  is  just\r\n\r\nanother  way  of  saying it but  all  the  same  it\r\n\r\namounts to the same thing - there was force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when election day came round we found that\r\n\r\nthe  voters  brought  in  cars,  instead  of  being\r\n\r\nallowed  to  enter the voting stations  peacefully,\r\n\r\nwere  surrounded by hundreds of youths. They opened\r\n\r\nthe  car doors for the voters, escorted them inside\r\n\r\nthe  polling stations and told them, \"Vote  for  so\r\n\r\nand  so; you must.\" This, Sir, is the use of force.\r\n\r\nI would say that the limits of the polling stations\r\n\r\nshould  be  extended in future so that only  voters\r\n\r\ncan enter them peacefully and will not be subjected\r\n\r\nto  this subtle form of intimidation which is  much\r\n\r\nmore serious and lasting than an open show of force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course again at these polling stations we\r\n\r\nfind soft drinks being passed around, by whom we do\r\n\r\nnot  know, but all those who were there in the  hot\r\n\r\nsun greatly enjoyed the drinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another malpractice takes the form of \"persuading\" voters to come out and vote. Groups of\r\n\r\nyoung  people -  five,  six,  seven  and  eight   in\r\n\r\neach - march  up  and  down  staircases  telling  the\r\n\r\npeople, \"You have to come down to vote\" and so  on.\r\n\r\nI   can  imagine  the  poor  voters,  not  able  to\r\n\r\nwithstand  such presure or daring to say  anything,\r\n\r\ncome down sheepishly to do what they were asked  to\r\n\r\ndo.  This is the type of \"persuasion\" we have heard\r\n\r\nof in iron curtain countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are yet other types of malpractice. I will\r\n\r\njust  mention  one. I understand from my  colleague\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tiong Bahru that in Craig Road a boy\r\n\r\nnamed  Lee  was  caught  red-handed  tearing   down\r\n\r\nelection posters. His explanation was, \"I  have  no\r\n\r\njob  and am paid $5 a day to do this. If I  do  not\r\n\r\ntake the job where am I to get money?\" Here is  one\r\n\r\ncase where money is unlawfully used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, Sir, I would say with regret that the\r\n\r\nelections system here is far from perfect.  If  the\r\n\r\nallegations  are  true that candidates  spend  more\r\n\r\nthan  $60,000 for an election when legally  he  can\r\n\r\nonly  spend  $6,000 or $7,000, then  I  think  that\r\n\r\nelections will be a farce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He was a Democratic candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> He may be one from the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nI  have heard of many instances of this malpractice\r\n\r\nof  spending money and they are not confined to one\r\n\r\nParty  alone but to all political Parties. Sir,  we\r\n\r\nmust put a stop to this practice in which a lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney  can  be thrown about by candidates  and  the\r\n\r\nhonest man cannot come forward. I think all show of\r\n\r\nforce, all types of \"persuasion\", and all forms  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  which is not legal,  like  paying  for\r\n\r\npicnics and other entertainment, should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso be stopped. It may be difficult to provide the\r\n\r\nnecessary laws but I think we should consider  ways\r\n\r\nand means of combating all these malpractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, that the person by bringing up the\r\n\r\nmotion  charging these malpractices cannot  thereby\r\n\r\nprove that he himself is clean. This motion can  be\r\n\r\nbrought up by any person. I remember -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why did you not bring it up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> -when I was a young boy\r\n\r\nnoticing that whenever two boys quarrel it was  the\r\n\r\none  who  started  the  quarrel  who  would  always\r\n\r\ncomplain  to  the  mother that the  other  boy  had\r\n\r\nbeaten  him  up. We are grown-ups but that  can  be\r\n\r\nrepeated  here.  However, the  motion  is  good  in\r\n\r\nprinciple  and  we should find ways  and  means  of\r\n\r\nhaving cleaner elections and giving a chance to all\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  good,  able and  honest,  to  come\r\n\r\nforward  to serve Singapore. We do not want corrupt\r\n\r\npeople  who use gangsters, make use of boys or  let\r\n\r\nloose  peace  doves after winning the elections  to\r\n\r\nrule Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.54 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nCommission   which  is  at  present  looking   into\r\n\r\ncorruption  in  the  public service  and  in  other\r\n\r\npublic  bodies should have its terms  of  reference\r\n\r\nexpanded  to include the investigation  of  corrupt\r\n\r\npractices  which  are  known to  have  taken  place\r\n\r\nduring  the  by-elections in Cairnhill and  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.  Sir,  it is no use our trying to  keep  our\r\n\r\npublic   service  and  public  bodies   free   from\r\n\r\ncorruption  if we do nothing to stamp  out  corrupt\r\n\r\npractices during elections. Sir, if candidates  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  resort  to  corrupt  practices  during\r\n\r\nelections, this will reduce democracy to  a  farce,\r\n\r\nand  if  action is not taken now to put a  stop  to\r\n\r\nthese   malpractices,  the  unscrupulous  and   the\r\n\r\nambitious will be led to believe that it  is  quite\r\n\r\nlawful for them to use these despicable means in an\r\n\r\nattempt to seize power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support which certain candidates have\r\n\r\nreceived  from  shady elements  in  the  population\r\n\r\nduring  the last by-elections has been reported  in\r\n\r\nthe local Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  newspapers have also mentioned that at certain\r\n\r\nelection  rallies  those  who  attended  were  more\r\n\r\ninterested  in  bottles of soft drinks  which  were\r\n\r\ndistributed  free to all and sundry, than  in  what\r\n\r\nthe  candidates were trying to say. This may  speak\r\n\r\nwell,  Sir,  for  the  manufacturers  of  the  soft\r\n\r\ndrinks,  but  those  responsible  should  still  be\r\n\r\nrequested to explain why they had to rely  more  on\r\n\r\nthe  quality of those drinks than on what they were\r\n\r\ntrying to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in Tanjong Pagar a certain candidate\r\n\r\nused women of doubtful virtue to parade in his cars\r\n\r\nto  tempt  voters to ride with them to the  polling\r\n\r\nbooths.  All  this  shows,  Sir,  to  what   limits\r\n\r\ncandidates  were  prepared  to  go  to  gain  their\r\n\r\npolitical ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of reference of the Commission, Sir,\r\n\r\nshould  therefore  be  extended  to  enable  it  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate and report on all the corrupt practices\r\n\r\nwhich  were  known to have taken place  during  the\r\n\r\nrecent by-elections in Cairnhill and Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\nIt  is only in this way, Sir, that public attention\r\n\r\ncan  be drawn to the need for keeping our elections\r\n\r\nclean  if democracy in Singapore is to have a  fair\r\n\r\nchance  to  succeed.  No  one  can  deny  that  the\r\n\r\nstamping out of corrupt practices from our election\r\n\r\nprocedure  is even more important to the well-being\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  than  is  the  work  on  which  the\r\n\r\nCommission is now engaged.

Sir,  I  think the problem is not  so  easy.\r\n\r\nIllegal and corrupt practices are very difficult to\r\n\r\ndetect,  and while attempting to tidy the  law,  I\r\n\r\ndoubt  very much whether the Commission of  Inquiry\r\n\r\non  corrupt  practices is the proper body  to  look\r\n\r\ninto this matter. I should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  thought  that probably the hon.

I say  this,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  no  member of the Commission would  be  so\r\n\r\nfully  aware  of  the corrupt practices  which  are\r\n\r\nprevalent  during election time than the  political\r\n\r\nParties themselves. But I think, Sir, all these are\r\n\r\ntemporary  measures.

The way to do  this  is\r\n\r\nnot  to say, during election time, \"I will do  this\r\n\r\nor  I  will do that\" or \"My Party is the best Party\r\n\r\nin  Singapore\"; but to educate the  masses  on  how\r\n\r\nelections  can  be  held  in  the  most  democratic\r\n\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel, Sir, that Parties are putting party\r\n\r\ninterests first rather than the national interests,\r\n\r\nwith  a  view to seeking power. I suggest that  the\r\n\r\nnational  interests  should be stressed  first  and\r\n\r\nforemost  during  election time rather  than  party\r\n\r\ninterests.  I would like to ask all the Parties  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to get together and try to  work  out  a\r\n\r\nsolution - first, to suggest to Government some  sort\r\n\r\nof   legislation   to  end  illegal   and   corrupt\r\n\r\npractices; and second, that all Parties should take\r\n\r\na  keener interest in political education among the\r\n\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.03 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  terms of reference of the Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry under Mr Justice Chua are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inquire into allegations of corruption against\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Legislative Assembly  or  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  service or against members or employees  of\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council  or  other statutory  bodies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  connection with  their  official  or\r\n\r\npublic duties;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To examine whether there is any justification for\r\n\r\nsuch  allegations and, if so, in what circumstances\r\n\r\nany   corrupt  transactions  took  place  and  what\r\n\r\npersons were involved therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Commission, Sir, was appointed for a\r\n\r\nspecific  purpose, the importance of which  can  be\r\n\r\ngauged  from  the  terms of  reference.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nconsider,  Sir,  that  this  Commission  should  be\r\n\r\nsaddled  with  additional terms of reference  which\r\n\r\nhave no connection with their original appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gather, Sir, from the speech of the hon. mover\r\n\r\nthat  what he aims to achieve by his motion  is  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  Commission  of  Inquiry  to  inquire  into\r\n\r\nallegations of corrupt and improper practices  with\r\n\r\na  view  to making recommendations as to  how  such\r\n\r\nmalpractices can be effectively detected,  punished\r\n\r\nand suppressed. The elections law, Sir, as the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has stated, is quite clear on this, but  it\r\n\r\nis  based  on Western lines. But I think  there  is\r\n\r\nindeed   room  for  improvement  in  the  machinery\r\n\r\nwhereby  such offenders can be brought to book.  It\r\n\r\nis  vital  that our parliamentary system should  be\r\n\r\nkept   above  any  corrupt  practices,   and   that\r\n\r\nelections  should be kept clean so that  candidates\r\n\r\nwho  are  returned to the Assembly or to the  local\r\n\r\ncouncils  will  be men and women of  integrity  and\r\n\r\nhonesty.

M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to congratulate the Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\non the principle involved in his motion. We feel on\r\n\r\nthis side that the present Commission should not be\r\n\r\nsaddled  with this additional work and that  a  new\r\n\r\nCommission  should  be appointed,  but  I  entirely\r\n\r\nagree with him on the principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have seen the plight of some countries\r\n\r\nwhere  politics  have become so  corrupt  that  the\r\n\r\nwhole  administrative machinery of those  countries\r\n\r\nhas  broken  down,  with chaotic  results  for  the\r\n\r\npopulation. Sir, as every election goes by, decent,\r\n\r\nhonest  men,  who  could  give  something  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  look  around and are aghast  at  the  way\r\n\r\nthings are going on in elections, at the amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney that is being spent, at the corruption of the\r\n\r\nyouth - Chinese youth by some Party, English-speaking\r\n\r\nyouth  by  another  Party - and  at  other  ways   of\r\n\r\ncorruption  which have been brought  to  light  but\r\n\r\nwhich cannot be proved in a court of law. And these\r\n\r\ndecent  men  ask  themselves,  \"Why  should  I  get\r\n\r\ninvolved in these things?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the world there is a sense of values. You\r\n\r\ncannot  get something for nothing. If a man has  to\r\n\r\nspend  $50,000 to $60,000 to fight an election  and\r\n\r\nif  he wins and becomes a Minister, you can be sure\r\n\r\nthat  he will try to recover four or five times  as\r\n\r\nmuch - he  will be a corrupt Minister.  If  you  want\r\n\r\nhonest  Ministers, if you want honest  politicians,\r\n\r\nyou cannot expect them to spend $50,000, or $60,000\r\n\r\nor  $80,000 on an election. If they do, you can  be\r\n\r\nsure  what  the result is going to be.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nwarning which I am giving to this country;  when  I\r\n\r\nsee how things are moving - we are following\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   line  of  many  countries  where   such\r\n\r\nmalpractices prevail, and it is going to be  a  sad\r\n\r\nday  for  us  if  we  cannot preserve  decency  and\r\n\r\nhonesty in our politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another form of corruption which no\r\n\r\nMember  has  referred to, and that is  the  \"gentle\r\n\r\npersuasion\"  of Independents to stand for  election\r\n\r\nin  order to split votes. That also, Sir, is a form\r\n\r\nof  corruption,  though it is not  covered  by  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  corrupt practices in the  Ordinance;\r\n\r\nbut that does happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.18 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nagree  with the Minister for Commerce and  Industry\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said that he was very grateful indeed  to\r\n\r\nthe  mover  of the motion for introducing  such  an\r\n\r\nimportant motion, coming as it does on the  eve  of\r\n\r\nthe  coming  general elections. I  agree  with  the\r\n\r\npicture painted by the Member for Tanjong Pagar - and\r\n\r\nindeed   it  is  not  new  to  me - that   when   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries have got rid of colonialism,\r\n\r\nthe  people  suffer  because  of  the  practice  of\r\n\r\ncorruption.  And  now on the dawn of  independence,\r\n\r\ncolonialism  still  has its  followers.  Sooner  or\r\n\r\nlater,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we will achieve  complete\r\n\r\nindependence,   and  if  corrupt  practices   still\r\n\r\nprevail,  will  they  benefit the  people  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our public service should at all times be\r\n\r\ndeserving  of  applause by  having  no  charges  of\r\n\r\ncorrupt practice levelled at it, but if it  is  led\r\n\r\nby  corrupt  elected Ministers, then its  integrity\r\n\r\nwill be severely jeopardised. Therefore this motion\r\n\r\nby the Member for Tanjong Pagar has been introduced\r\n\r\nin  time  to check any malpractice which, according\r\n\r\nto many hon. Members who have spoken, was practised\r\n\r\nin the recent by-elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that malpractice assumed two\r\n\r\nforms  in the recent by-elections: one, money;  and\r\n\r\nthe  other, \"gentle persuasion\". It was a shock  to\r\n\r\nme  when the Member for Serangoon denounced in very\r\n\r\nclear tones the malpractice actually carried out by\r\n\r\nall the political Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am much worried whether we can depend on\r\n\r\nthe  public to help Mr Justice Chua carry out  his\r\n\r\nwork  on,  the  Commission of  Inquiry  on  corrupt\r\n\r\npractices. I heard him appeal over Radio Malaya  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  to come forward to give  evidence.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that corrupt practice is always coupled  with\r\n\r\nbribery.  If  there  is  no bribery,  there  is  no\r\n\r\ncorruption;  but  unfortunately in  this  so-called\r\n\r\nentrepot  centre of Singapore where  many  business\r\n\r\ntransactions  take place, there are  many  ways  to\r\n\r\nmake quick money. That is why I say that bribery is\r\n\r\nthe  twin brother of corruption and why Mr Justice\r\n\r\nChua can hardly carry on his work smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Sir, it is to be an inquiry into corrupt\r\n\r\npractice  in the election. It involves hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands of voters. It will be much easier for the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry to carry out its work if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   sincerely  support  this   motion   in\r\n\r\nprincipal.  The Chief Minister and the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Front have stated that they do  support\r\n\r\nthis motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should make full use of the Department of\r\n\r\nInformation Services and ask them to stop  printing\r\n\r\nMinisters'   pictures   and   sending   them    out\r\n\r\neverywhere. They should go to every nook and corner\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  Island and inform the  public  about\r\n\r\nthis Commission of Inquiry. Top priority should  be\r\n\r\ngiven to this Commission. The public should be told\r\n\r\nthat  it  is of vital importance for them  to  come\r\n\r\nforward and give evidence to this Commission  which\r\n\r\nis  to investigate malpractices in the election. If\r\n\r\nthe  people  want an incorruptible  government,  if\r\n\r\nthey  want  their representatives to work  honestly\r\n\r\nfor them, they must come forward and give evidence.\r\n\r\nThey should not be expected to have \"Green Spot\" [a\r\n\r\nsoft drink] offered to them or beautiful ladies  to\r\n\r\nentertain them if they want a clean election and  a\r\n\r\nclean government. They should be conscious of their\r\n\r\ncivic responsibilities. So I think this is the time\r\n\r\nfor the Department of Information Services, led  by\r\n\r\nMr  Thomson, to co-operate sincerely and make this\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry a top\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npriority job to investigate corrupt practices,  and\r\n\r\ninvite  the  public to come forward with  evidence.\r\n\r\nThen this Commission will really mean something  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore  and  will  prevent  the\r\n\r\ncollapse of the democratic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.25 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI am really surprised at the accusation levelled by\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Commerce  and  Industry   that\r\n\r\nIndependent  candidates who cause a  split  in  the\r\n\r\nvotes  are  corrupted.

I\r\n\r\nactually attended a number of election rallies and,\r\n\r\nas the Member for Tanjong Pagar has correctly said,\r\n\r\nsoft  drinks were distributed to those who went  to\r\n\r\nthese  rallies not for the purpose of listening  to\r\n\r\nthe  election  speeches  but  for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nenjoying  a  nice drink. But apart from these  soft\r\n\r\ndrinks,  I  also  saw  lorry-loads  of  people  not\r\n\r\nconnected  with the by-election in that  particular\r\n\r\ndivision  brought  to  the rallies.  What  was  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  bringing  a  man  from  Serangoon   or\r\n\r\nTampenis to Cairnhill or Tanjong Pagar to listen  to\r\n\r\nthe  speeches? What good did it make? Can that  man\r\n\r\nvote?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I doubt if you could make  a  man  from\r\n\r\nanother  division, coming to these  two  particular\r\n\r\ndivisions,  vote. All these accusations  have  been\r\n\r\nmade  every  time after an election. What  has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  done?  What have the political  Parties\r\n\r\ndone?  It  is  not only because of the by-elections\r\n\r\nthat corruption and malpractices have occurred ever\r\n\r\nsince  1948.  Why then does the Government  not  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about  it, or the political  Parties  do\r\n\r\nsomething  about  it?  Is  there  much  purpose  in\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a  Commission of Inquiry into  corrupt\r\n\r\npractices? It will serve no purpose. The most  that\r\n\r\nyou  can  get  out  of  it is  a  Report  from  the\r\n\r\nCommission  that  such  and  such  practices   have\r\n\r\noccurred.  But  where will all this end?  When  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections  come  next  year,  again   such\r\n\r\naccusations  will be made; but what could  be  done\r\n\r\nabout that?

The  setting\r\n\r\nup  of a Commission of Inquiry will not get us very\r\n\r\nfar,  although we may be able to find out something\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Report of the Commission. What  I  think\r\n\r\nshould be done is this: the Government through  the\r\n\r\nInformation  Services should set up  civic  centres\r\n\r\nand  teach  the  people that  they  should  not  be\r\n\r\ncorrupted in any election and how to vote. It is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the  civic course that  we  give  the\r\n\r\npeople.  It  is  not a question of  just  having  a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry and to say, \"Oh, yes. So  and\r\n\r\nso is corrupted and so and so has offered money for\r\n\r\na  vote  or so.\" Like the Democratic Party  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  general  elections which  spent  as  much  as\r\n\r\n$60,000  as the Member for Tanjong Pagar said - I  am\r\n\r\nsorry he did not refer to that particular Party.

He is not in this Assembly today.  That\r\n\r\nclearly indicates that money could get him nowhere.\r\n\r\nIt is not a question that by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffering  money and bribes, you could get  yourself\r\n\r\ninto  this  Assembly.  It is your  service  to  the\r\n\r\npublic;  it is your sincerity to the public.  So  I\r\n\r\nfeel that the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\nwill  get  us nowhere. The Hon. the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said  that the Government is going to  abstain\r\n\r\nfrom  voting and I think I will abstain  with  them\r\n\r\nnot  because  I  do  not  support  the  motion   in\r\n\r\nprinciple - the motion in itself is good and  I  will\r\n\r\njoin  the  Minister for Commerce  and  Industry  to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar   in\r\n\r\nintroducing such a motion - but because as the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said that the present Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  is burdened with a heavy job and  that  in\r\n\r\nspite  of all his appeals only 24 were prepared  to\r\n\r\ncome forward and give evidence. Now if you were  to\r\n\r\nburden  him  with an extra job, it will extend  the\r\n\r\ntime  of his Commission and where does he land?  It\r\n\r\nmight  take another year for him to submit a report\r\n\r\nto  this  Assembly or to the Government or  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  and by the time when that year comes around\r\n\r\nall  of us may not be here. So why should we extend\r\n\r\nthe time limit of that Commission? Either set up  a\r\n\r\nnew Commission to inquire into this particular case\r\n\r\nor  have  nothing at all and then give a policy  or\r\n\r\ndirective  to  the  Information Services  to  start\r\n\r\ncivic    courses,    teach   the    public    civic\r\n\r\nconsciousness, the right to vote and  how  to  vote\r\n\r\nand that they should not be subject to corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.37 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Minister for Education has mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  his Party lost honourably. I do not challenge\r\n\r\nthat  statement but I must say that allegations  of\r\n\r\ncorrupt  practices have also been made against  his\r\n\r\nParty.    When   these   elections   were   fought,\r\n\r\nallegations have been made against every Party  and\r\n\r\nnot  against one Party only. In one way or another,\r\n\r\nevery  Party  was  alleged to have committed  these\r\n\r\ncorrupt practices or used force to persuade  people\r\n\r\nto  vote  for  them. So much so  that  many  of  my\r\n\r\nfriends  and acquaintances - responsible people  with\r\n\r\nlimited means - have told\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  that they are going to eschew politics and will\r\n\r\nnot  stand for election because it is too  dirty  a\r\n\r\ngame. Because of this, I do welcome this inquiry in\r\n\r\nprinciple and we shall support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, such evil practices are bound to\r\n\r\noccur at the start of any new political development\r\n\r\nbecause some people always think that by the use of\r\n\r\nmoney  or the might of power, they can force people\r\n\r\nto  vote  for  them and thus make  them  support  a\r\n\r\nsystem  of government against the people's  wishes.\r\n\r\nBut from what I can see as a result of the last two\r\n\r\nelections,  I  think all the money  that  has  been\r\n\r\nspent  or  alleged to have been spent and  all  the\r\n\r\npractices  of  using  gangsters,  school  boys  and\r\n\r\nschool  girls  have not resulted in the  way  those\r\n\r\npeople  who  encouraged corruption have  wished.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  voters are now learning the  fact  that\r\n\r\ntheir vote is secret and that their vote cannot  be\r\n\r\nbought; even if they do fall into the temptation of\r\n\r\naccepting  five or ten dollars, they can  still  go\r\n\r\nand vote in secret and nobody can touch them. That,\r\n\r\nto  my  mind, is the only practical way of  getting\r\n\r\nour people to go and vote as they think fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.39 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I formerly felt rather\r\n\r\nshy  as  a Member of this House because I  hold  my\r\n\r\nseat by nomination: but the trend of the debate has\r\n\r\napparently  been in the direction that it  is  more\r\n\r\nhonourable  and  cleaner to be nominated  into  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  than  it  is to be  elected.  That  is  a\r\n\r\nconclusion which I cannot accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck)\r\n\r\nmentioned just now that people are saying  nowadays\r\n\r\nthat politics are too dirty and corrupt to go into.\r\n\r\nWell  I heard that back in early 1948. A friend  of\r\n\r\nmine  said that to me himself: \"Local politics will\r\n\r\nbe  so dirty that no decent man will go into them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen  I  heard that, I said, \"Well, if that is  so,\r\n\r\nthen  I think I will go into them and find out  for\r\n\r\nmyself to see whether I can do anything about  it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  I  did  go in with the Labour Party which  was\r\n\r\nformed  at the initiative of the gentleman who  was\r\n\r\nat the bottom of the poll and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlost  his  deposit  in  the Cairnhill  by-election.\r\n\r\nSince  1948, I have seen a good deal of  the  dirty\r\n\r\nside  of  politics. I have mixed  with  some  dirty\r\n\r\npeople;  some of them are out of politics  now  and\r\n\r\nothers  are  still with us. It has not always  been\r\n\r\npleasant but I could not see any alternative. But I\r\n\r\nhave also mixed with some very decent and very good\r\n\r\npeople indeed and I have not much doubt that it  is\r\n\r\npossible  always for a decent poor man  to  beat  a\r\n\r\ncorrupt rich man in a straight fight. The high cost\r\n\r\nof votes has been referred to: it is usually a high\r\n\r\ncost  of votes to the losing candidate. The winning\r\n\r\ncandidate,  if he is a decent candidate,  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily have to spend money in that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can accept the view that\r\n\r\n\"anything  you  can do, I can do dirtier\".  I  feel\r\n\r\npretty sure that there are quite a number of things\r\n\r\nwrong  but  I am also sure that there are  a  great\r\n\r\nmany  things right. We should not in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nor elsewhere take it that Singapore is tottering on\r\n\r\nthe  brink of collapse into a sea of corruption and\r\n\r\nfilth.  The standard of living is high in Singapore\r\n\r\nas compared with many other countries. The standard\r\n\r\nof  public conduct and public life is also high  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  many  other  places.  Neither   the\r\n\r\nstandard  of living nor the standard of conduct  is\r\n\r\nperfectly satisfactory. There are certainly  things\r\n\r\nthat  could be and must be improved but  we  should\r\n\r\nnot  regard  ourselves as isolated from decency  by\r\n\r\nbottomless pits of corruption all around us.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  that the civil service is in danger  of\r\n\r\nbeing  corrupted and that the Permanent Secretaries\r\n\r\nwould  become corrupted because they got a Minister\r\n\r\nwho  is  not  all that he should be. I  think  they\r\n\r\nwould  bring  the  Minister up to  their  level  if\r\n\r\nnecessary; or at least see that he did not exercise\r\n\r\nhis  position in any wrongful way. What is  needed,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, is that good and decent  men  of\r\n\r\nprinciple  and character should come  forward  into\r\n\r\npolitics  and  take a leading part.  Inquiries  may\r\n\r\nshow  where  the  dirt  exists  and  laws  may   do\r\n\r\nsomething  to  clean up the dirt, but  no  law,  no\r\n\r\ninquiry, indeed nothing, can take the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace  of  high  principles and high  standards  of\r\n\r\nconduct  amongst the leadership of the country.  If\r\n\r\nthat  is lacking, the laws will not be enforceable.\r\n\r\nIf  that is there, the laws in this matter will not\r\n\r\nmake  a great deal of difference because they  will\r\n\r\nnot  be required and that is the word which I  want\r\n\r\nto leave with the House. It is my firm opinion that\r\n\r\nwe  have  in Singapore an enormous reserve of  good\r\n\r\nand  decent  people who should be  taking  part  in\r\n\r\npolitical life; who hitherto have not taken  enough\r\n\r\npart;  and they are the people whom we have got  to\r\n\r\nbring  into politics because they are the salvation\r\n\r\nand  the  future of this country. I hope that  this\r\n\r\nproposal to examine political life and put it under\r\n\r\na  microscope will do something to show  them  that\r\n\r\nthey  can come in. They will see that the bad  side\r\n\r\nis not going to get away with things. They will see\r\n\r\nthat  there is a future for a clean and decent  man\r\n\r\nto  come  into political life and serve his country\r\n\r\nand meet the needs of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.42 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\na  lot  has been said about corrupt practices being\r\n\r\nheld  at the last by-elections.

He\r\n\r\nrecited a few things like: we broke up one  of  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialist meetings. He went on  to  say - one\r\n\r\nof  his wisecracks today - that he caught a boy named\r\n\r\nLee  who  was tearing down posters at the  rate  of\r\n\r\nfive dollars per day. Now, Sir, any Party that  can\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay five dollars per day just  to  tear\r\n\r\ndown  posters must have a lot of reserves  and  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action Party have not got such  financial\r\n\r\nbacking.  So I assume that this boy must have  been\r\n\r\nemployed  by somebody who does have such  financial\r\n\r\nbacking. Be that as it may, I am surprised to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom  the Member for Serangoon that the Member  for\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru  (Mr William Tan) caught  a  boy  who\r\n\r\nconfessed  to him that he was paid five  dollars  a\r\n\r\nday  for  doing something illegal and that  he  had\r\n\r\nnever  sought  to  bring this matter  to  a  police\r\n\r\nstation.  Now, Sir, on the other hand, one  of  our\r\n\r\nboys was slapped at Duxton Hill corner for sticking\r\n\r\nup  our  posters. I will say this for the Singapore\r\n\r\nPolice  Force, that they traced the man and we  are\r\n\r\nprosecuting him. That is the way to do it. It is no\r\n\r\nuse  alleging that illegal acts were committed  and\r\n\r\ndoing  nothing about it. As I said just now. I  can\r\n\r\nprove  the  connection between this little  account\r\n\r\nbook  with  one of the Mak brothers  but  I  cannot\r\n\r\nprove  the connection between the Mak boy  and  the\r\n\r\ncandidate, otherwise this thing would go to a court\r\n\r\nof law for a proper adjudication to be made on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think we should clearly understand\r\n\r\nthat what we are debating today - although it has got\r\n\r\nits  funny aspects, its lighter moments - is  a  very\r\n\r\nsober and, in my opinion, a very decisive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfactor  in whether or not next  year  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  see  a fairly clean Legislature  with  a\r\n\r\nclean, honest and effective government. If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  see  it,  then I say that the  chances  of  it\r\n\r\nhappening in the subsequent election are even less.\r\n\r\nIn  which  case,  I say that the  battle  for  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system  is  lost.  If  you   want   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system,  certain  conditions  must   be\r\n\r\nestablished,  otherwise  the  way   is   open   for\r\n\r\ndictatorship. My appraisal of the situation is that\r\n\r\nwe  have  two more tries in Singapore  and  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation, which will take us about ten years.  If\r\n\r\nby   that   time  the  conditions  have  not   been\r\n\r\nestablished, time has run out and either a military\r\n\r\njunta of the nature of Colonel Nasser or a monarchy\r\n\r\nof the nature of King Hussein of Jordan will emerge\r\n\r\nas the alternative to a dictatorship of the Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested to hear today from the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Commerce  and  Industry,  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works, and even from the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Paya Lebar that the attitude is: \"Why should  I\r\n\r\nget  involved?  This  is all a dirty  business.\"  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  people of Singapore and the  people  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  had  better understand  this:  we  are  all\r\n\r\ninvolved in this. That is the first thing  we  must\r\n\r\nunderstand. If this system collapses, not only will\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Paya Lebar lose his Sembawang  Hill\r\n\r\nEstate  with 1,000 housing units, but he will  lose\r\n\r\nit  without  compensation, and he will lose  a  few\r\n\r\nother physical things besides, all of a sudden.  It\r\n\r\nis  no  use  to say, \"Why should I be  involved  in\r\n\r\nthis? I am going to concentrate on architecture and\r\n\r\n7\ufffd  per cent. I am not interested in this. I  can\r\n\r\nfind  honest ways of earning a living. Let us leave\r\n\r\nthis  business of being a politician to the rogues,\r\n\r\nthe scallywags, the vagabonds and the adventurers.\"\r\n\r\nIf  that  happens, let me say this: the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  cannot  work. A dictatorship  must  emerge.\r\n\r\nThat  dictatorship will probably make things worse,\r\n\r\nand    armed   revolution   will   be   its   final\r\n\r\nconsummation. It is inevitable. We must bring  home\r\n\r\nto the people that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neverybody is involved in it. There is no such thing\r\n\r\nas 'I am not involved,' not even if you are a civil\r\n\r\nservant with your pension guaranteed. That  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst thing we should tell our civil servants. They\r\n\r\nare involved; they have got to make the system work\r\n\r\nor we all perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of those side-effects of paternal\r\n\r\ncolonialism:  paternal only  to  a  small  section,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  the English-educated upper class - I mean  the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon, the Member for Stamford,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Communications and Works who were\r\n\r\nspeaking of their friends and acquaintances.  These\r\n\r\nfriends  and acquaintances are the English-educated\r\n\r\nmiddle class, a fairly comfortably set up class who\r\n\r\nare  honest up to a point, in the sense  that  they\r\n\r\nwould  not  do  anything dishonest.  But  they  are\r\n\r\nlacking  in  moral fibre in that they are  shutting\r\n\r\ntheir eyes and they are saying, \"Well, you do that.\r\n\r\nKeep  the  system  going. I make money  the  honest\r\n\r\nway.\"  But you cannot make it the honest  way  when\r\n\r\nthe  system collapses. Everybody will collapse. The\r\n\r\npaternal colonial government has bred this attitude\r\n\r\nof  'You look after politics for me. I mind my  own\r\n\r\nbusiness, namely, to make money.' That has  got  to\r\n\r\nstop and it will stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I raised this motion, I\r\n\r\nknew  that there would be the charges and  counter-charges  vis-a-vis Parties, but let me say this  to\r\n\r\nevery  Party in this Assembly and every Party  that\r\n\r\nbelieves  in  democratic competition. They  have  a\r\n\r\nstake in this system and have to see that it works.\r\n\r\nIt  is not going to work once you start introducing\r\n\r\nother than straightforward competition of political\r\n\r\nideals and political ideas. Once you introduce soft\r\n\r\ndrinks,  girls  in motor cars to take  you  to  the\r\n\r\npolls, money for votes and strong-arm methods, then\r\n\r\nI say a dictatorship may be a better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalternative to a corrupt, subverted democracy.  But\r\n\r\nI will say one lesson for all of us which all of us\r\n\r\nmust  learn. It is not good enough to say, \"Let  us\r\n\r\nfind  honest men to come forward and lead.\"  Honest\r\n\r\nmen  will  come forward and find that nobody  wants\r\n\r\nthem  to  lead. You must first be honest. You  must\r\n\r\nnext  have  idealism.  You must  have  convictions.\r\n\r\nFinally  you  must  organise  to  bring  home  your\r\n\r\nconvictions to the people. If you just sit back and\r\n\r\nsay, \"I am an honest man,\" and do nothing about it,\r\n\r\nthat  is  the end of the matter. Nobody  will  know\r\n\r\nthat  you are an honest man. Not only must  you  be\r\n\r\nhonest and have convictions but you must bring home\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that you are honest and have convictions\r\n\r\nand  that  those  convictions  are  in  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest before you can win.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this to the Member for Serangoon who\r\n\r\nhas  sought  to make charges against my  Party.  My\r\n\r\nParty  may have a lot of faults, but there  is  one\r\n\r\nfault  that it has not got - too much money. We  have\r\n\r\nnot got the money to use, but we have drive, talent\r\n\r\nand the ability to organise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this to the Independents. They are the\r\n\r\nbane  of  Singapore politics. For God's  sake,  get\r\n\r\ntogether,  do  something and  stand  for  something\r\n\r\nother than yourselves, because in the next election\r\n\r\nthe stakes are higher. In 1948 the stakes were low.\r\n\r\nAll you could hope to be was the Hon. Mr So and So\r\n\r\nin the Legislative Council. Then you get invited to\r\n\r\na Government House party which is what the English-educated middle class wanted - birthday parties,  the\r\n\r\nQueen's  Birthday,  and meet the  Governor.  Either\r\n\r\nthat  kind of politician or the other type who gets\r\n\r\ninto  the  City  Council and sits on the  Transport\r\n\r\nCommittee,  the Hawkers Committee. The stakes  were\r\n\r\nlow - chicken-feed. Therefore one does not stick  out\r\n\r\none's neck too much. Today we have heard from three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthoritative sources - three gentlemen who ought  to\r\n\r\nknow - if there is anybody in Singapore who ought  to\r\n\r\nknow at all - that it has been a dirty business. With\r\n\r\nthe Rendel Constitution, the stakes increased. Now,\r\n\r\none  could  be a Minister, and if one  could  be  a\r\n\r\nMinister,  one  could be in charge of  A.P. forms,\r\n\r\nimport and export permits, immigration permits,  in\r\n\r\nor  out  at $500 or $50 per time. One could  be  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  contracts and tenders. The  stakes  are\r\n\r\ngoing  up. In the next election, the stakes  go  up\r\n\r\nhigher  because  we  are  taking  over  the   whole\r\n\r\ninternal  machinery. Let me put it to these  small-time  politicians  in  this  way:  they  are  after\r\n\r\nchicken-feed, $5,000 per bus licence or $50  for  a\r\n\r\nhawker's  pitch, and all these little  things.  One\r\n\r\ntakes  a long time to get rich that way, and  every\r\n\r\ntime  you  take  a risk, there is a risk  of  being\r\n\r\ncaught. But if you could be a Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry  in  a  completely  internally  self-governing administration-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> A Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and it you could also be a\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  and everybody set up  nicely,  you\r\n\r\ncould  by just a few book deals swipe a few million\r\n\r\ndollars  very  quickly.  Now  that  is  worth   it.\r\n\r\nTherefore  in the next election, if we allow  these\r\n\r\ntypes  to  win,  then I say within five  years  you\r\n\r\neither  knock  them  out  completely  and  start  a\r\n\r\nrevolution  before they do damage, or  within  five\r\n\r\nyears the damage that they would have done would be\r\n\r\nof such a permanent nature that you would never get\r\n\r\nthe  people  to believe in a democratic system.  We\r\n\r\nare  not  dealing with a highly educated  political\r\n\r\nelectorate, not at the moment. But like electorates\r\n\r\nanywhere  in the world, they judge institutions  by\r\n\r\nthe  results they produce. It is no use arguing the\r\n\r\ntheory  of  democracy,  the  right  of  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech,  the right of freedom of association,  etc.\r\n\r\nIf  it  does  not provide benefits  to  him  as  an\r\n\r\nindividual, it  has no meaning. If internal  self-government next year means that this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeautiful  Assembly building renovated  at  a  high\r\n\r\ncost  with  red  plushed  leather  seats  and  foam\r\n\r\ncushions  and all the dignity and the paraphernalia\r\n\r\nof  a  parliament with wealthy Ministers and junior\r\n\r\nMinisters - that    the   people    associate    this\r\n\r\ninstitution  with  corruption and  oppression,  and\r\n\r\nafter five years, if that is their attitude to this\r\n\r\ninstitution, then I say that we cannot start  going\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, we can start a fresh page. We can say,\r\n\r\n\"The  past was because of colonialism. We down it.\"\r\n\r\nWe  shove  all the rubbish to one corner  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"There  you are, this evil, the white men did  it.\"\r\n\r\nIf  after five years there is a lot of rubbish,  we\r\n\r\nhave  got to decide where to shove it to, and  then\r\n\r\nthey  will say of the corrupt politicians that they\r\n\r\nwere  the agents of colonialism. Then where do  you\r\n\r\ngo from there? But the third time it is all over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I say that it is our duty as\r\n\r\nconstitutional  political Parties to  preserve  and\r\n\r\nimprove  the conditions on which democracy must  be\r\n\r\nhoisted before it can hope to flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking for a division on my motion but on\r\n\r\nthis  understanding, Mr Speaker, Sir,  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  technical difficulties involved, that if  this\r\n\r\nmotion  is  carried, it means that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  appoint  a separate Court of  Inquiry.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  satisfied to have a separate Court  provided\r\n\r\nthat there is sufficient protection given for it to\r\n\r\nmake a complete and thorough inquiry. There must be\r\n\r\ncomplete  privilege,  sympathy  if  necessary,  and\r\n\r\nextra judicial powers in the sense that it can hear\r\n\r\nevidence which would not otherwise be received, and\r\n\r\ncan hear second-hand evidence if necessary. On that\r\n\r\nunderstanding, I would ask not only  this  side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  to vote for it, but also the Government\r\n\r\nside to vote for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On that understanding, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will vote for the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
