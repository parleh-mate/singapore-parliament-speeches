This  is  because  of\r\n\r\nfavourable   external  developments  in  the   region   and   an\r\n\r\nimprovement in the global electronics industry.  It is also  due\r\n\r\nto the decisive measures we took to reduce business costs, which\r\n\r\nhave  helped to boost our competitiveness.  In May, MTI upgraded\r\n\r\nits  1999  GDP growth forecast from the original -1% to  1%,  to\r\n\r\nbetween  0% and 2%.  Recent data suggest that the economy  might\r\n\r\noutperform  this  range.  MTI will revise  the  growth  forecast\r\n\r\nagain  in August, when the full economic results for the  second\r\n\r\nquarter become available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector leads our economic recovery. It\r\n\r\ngrew  by  8.2% in the first five months of 1999, on the back  of\r\n\r\nrobust  expansion  in  the electronics and  chemicals  clusters.\r\n\r\nIndicators from the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother  sectors of the economy show that the recovery is becoming\r\n\r\nmore broad-based, although not every sector is doing well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commerce sector will benefit from a pick up in tourism.\r\n\r\nVisitor  arrivals grew by 7.2% between January and May, compared\r\n\r\nto  the double-digit declines last year.  The financial services\r\n\r\nsector  has  been  boosted by the buoyant stock  market.  Shares\r\n\r\ntransacted grew by 270% in value terms and 390% in volume  terms\r\n\r\nin April-May 1999.  But offshore and domestic lending activities\r\n\r\nare still lagging behind.  The construction sector remains weak,\r\n\r\ndespite the improved property market sentiment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospects for continued growth in the second half of 1999\r\n\r\nare favourable. But whether the current recovery is sustained in\r\n\r\nthe  longer  term  will  depend on both  external  and  internal\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Externally, we are heavily dependent on overseas markets.\r\n\r\nSo  we  need the OECD economies to stay robust and to keep their\r\n\r\nmarkets open. In the region, a sustained recovery will depend on\r\n\r\ncountries persevering with their restructuring efforts. The risk\r\n\r\nis  that  the current signs of recovery will cause countries  to\r\n\r\nput  off painful restructuring measures.  Restructuring  by  our\r\n\r\nneighbours will mean keener competition for Singapore, but it is\r\n\r\nbetter   for   us   to  have  strong  and  healthy   neighbours,\r\n\r\ncontributing to the stability and prosperity of the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internally, we must persevere with the strategies mapped\r\n\r\nout  by  the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC).  We\r\n\r\nmust  not become complacent just because the economy has started\r\n\r\nto  pick up. We must upgrade our capabilities and strengthen our\r\n\r\ncompetitive position.  The CSC has emphasised the importance  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  our  physical infrastructure,  technology,  market\r\n\r\nnetworks  and manpower. We should make full use of  the  current\r\n\r\nwindow of opportunity to do this. This is vital to maintain  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in the long run, as the region recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term, we must continue to watch our business\r\n\r\ncosts carefully. We need to nurse the present economic recovery,\r\n\r\nand not choke it off by allowing costs to rise prematurely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $10.5 billion cost reduction package announced by the\r\n\r\nGovernment last November covered taxes, industrial land rentals,\r\n\r\nutilities and transport charges, and other Government  fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges.   Some  of these were outright rate reductions;  others\r\n\r\nwere  one-off  rebates to be reviewed after one  to  two  years.\r\n\r\nMany of the reductions came into effect only this January.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will see through these cost reductions as promised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major part of the cost-cutting package was the reduction\r\n\r\nin labour costs, to be achieved by reducing bonuses and variable\r\n\r\nwages,  plus  a  10%-point  reduction  in  the  employer's   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate, from 20% to 10%.  The CPF cut was to  be  for\r\n\r\ntwo years from 1st January 1999, after which we would review the\r\n\r\nsituation.  We  intended  to  progressively  restore   the   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate as the economy recovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitive labour costs remain a critical factor to\r\n\r\nsustain  investments  and jobs in Singapore.   Hence,  continued\r\n\r\nwage   restraint   is   essential.   This   is   why   the   NWC\r\n\r\nRecommendations   this   year  emphasised   caution   and   wage\r\n\r\nflexibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the measures we took, the CPF cut had the most\r\n\r\nimpact  on our business costs, and contributed significantly  to\r\n\r\nthe  current  recovery. It is total wage costs - both  take-home\r\n\r\npay  and  CPF - that matter to our competitiveness. If we  allow\r\n\r\nwage  settlements to go up too quickly now, we will be  negating\r\n\r\nthe  effect  of  the CPF cuts, and making it more  difficult  to\r\n\r\nrestore CPF contribution rates later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we recognise that in a strong recovery, wage\r\n\r\npressures  are unavoidable. Therefore, if the recovery continues\r\n\r\nto  gain  momentum,  it will be better for us  to  manage  these\r\n\r\npressures,   by   beginning  to  restore  the   employer's   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearlier,  while  continuing  to  exercise  restraint   in   wage\r\n\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will review the position towards the end of this year.\r\n\r\nBy  then  we will know this year's economic performance and  the\r\n\r\noutlook  for  next year.

The first question is whether\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry would have the revised forecast for the GDP growth\r\n\r\nfor  1999 in view of the strong recovery of the economy  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half.   The  second question is, in view  of  the  strong\r\n\r\nrecovery  of  the  economy,  would  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  advancing  the reinstatement of  the  CPF  cut  to  an\r\n\r\nearlier  date than two years so as to enable depositors  to  use\r\n\r\ntheir CPF money to help finance existing housing loans and  make\r\n\r\nnew investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained, we\r\n\r\nwill  review  the forecast when we have the full second  quarter\r\n\r\nfigures.   We  expect to make a revised forecast  come  National\r\n\r\nDay, which is our usual timing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for advancing the CPF restoration, I had explained also\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  to  look at CPF and wage take-home  pay  as  one\r\n\r\npackage  because  it  is the total wage  cost  which  makes  the\r\n\r\ndifference  to the competitiveness of the economy.  If  we  hold\r\n\r\ndown  CPF  but  allow wage costs to rise, then we  are  actually\r\n\r\nnegating  the  effect of the CPF cut and, in effect,  making  it\r\n\r\nmore  difficult for us to increase the CPF later on because  the\r\n\r\nwages  would  already  have risen.  If there  is  wage  pressure\r\n\r\nbecause  the economy is doing well and exports are strong,  then\r\n\r\nit may be better for us to restore CPF earlier and maintain wage\r\n\r\nrestraint longer, so that we can restore the CPF cut sooner, not\r\n\r\nin  full, but progressively, and manage our total wage  cost  as\r\n\r\nthe economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too early for us to commit now. We have said two years\r\n\r\nbut, as I said, if\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  economy  grows strongly, at the end of  the  year  we  will\r\n\r\nrevise  this  and consider whether we will begin to restore  the\r\n\r\nCPF come the year 2000, a year ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether this will make a contribution to housing loans,\r\n\r\nwe  will have to consider which components of the CPF we restore\r\n\r\nfirst.   When we cut the CPF we cut 6% from the Ordinary account\r\n\r\nand  4%  from the Special account.  The Special account  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst priority for CPF members to build up, because that is  put\r\n\r\naside  for  old  age  and as the absolute crucial  nest-egg,  as\r\n\r\nopposed  to something a little bit more than that which you  can\r\n\r\nuse  for housing or other investments.  When we restore  it,  my\r\n\r\npreference  would be to restore the Special account first.   But\r\n\r\nwe  will decide that later on.

Residential buildings are audited every\r\n\r\n10  years, and the others every five years.  Completed buildings\r\n\r\ndo  not  just collapse overnight.  There will be degradation  in\r\n\r\nstructures resulting in cracks, subsidence, leakages and  things\r\n\r\nlike  that.  These will usually be reported by the residents  or\r\n\r\nthe Town Councils, the principals or whoever is in charge of the\r\n\r\nbuilding.

We  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied at this point that the problem is an isolated  one  as\r\n\r\nopposed  to  the Hotel New World disaster where a Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry was convened.

Is there a\r\n\r\nvariance  allowed  on  the  limits  that  we  set?   The  second\r\n\r\nsupplementary  question is: is the Minister convinced  that  our\r\n\r\nstandards  are  consistent with the Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary\r\n\r\nAgreement under the WTO?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in so far as the limits are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  as  I  explained earlier, there are  certain  limits\r\n\r\nwhich  are set by internationally recognised bodies such as  the\r\n\r\nCodex  Alimentarius Commission.  They specify  different  limits\r\n\r\nfor  different  types  of pesticides.  For example,  there  were\r\n\r\nreports  that we do not allow certain pesticides to be  used  in\r\n\r\nSingapore whereas they are allowed in other countries.  In those\r\n\r\ncases,  what happened was that these pesticides have zero  MRLs,\r\n\r\nperhaps  because the Commission feels that these are  much  more\r\n\r\ndangerous  than  the  other pesticides.   So  whichever  MRL  is\r\n\r\nspecified by the international commission, that is the level  we\r\n\r\nadopt.   The  next  step is to do sampling or  random  tests  on\r\n\r\nconsignments that come in.  All the consignments that  come  in,\r\n\r\nthat   are  imported  into  Singapore  from  whichever   country\r\n\r\n(Malaysia,  Indonesia, Australia, and so  on),  are  subject  to\r\n\r\nquality control tests.  And the rule of thumb by the PPD is that\r\n\r\nnot  more  than 5% of the samples that are tested should  exceed\r\n\r\nthese  limits.   So  there  is  a  margin  of  error  built  in.\r\n\r\nObviously,  it is not possible to completely eliminate  all  the\r\n\r\ncontaminated batches, so there is a sampling error allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finding so far has been that the batches from Malaysia\r\n\r\nhave  exceeded this 5% guideline.  In fact, it has gone as  high\r\n\r\nas  30%, 40% for some species of vegetables.  This is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  with effect from 1st July, the PPD has implemented  a  much\r\n\r\nmore  stringent checking and testing procedure to try and  focus\r\n\r\non  some  of  these more, should I say, \"dangerous\"  vegetables.\r\n\r\nThere  are  about  22  of them, out of 100 vegetables  that  are\r\n\r\nimported into Singapore that are subject now to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese  new  regulations.  In fact, the result shows  that  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of these very stringent checks, we have been seeing  much\r\n\r\ncleaner batches of vegetables coming in over the last two  weeks\r\n\r\nor  so.   It is a little bit too early to tell.  But I think  we\r\n\r\nshould persevere with these more stringent checks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other question about whether they violate any WTO\r\n\r\nregulations, the answer obviously is no.  These are checks which\r\n\r\nare  necessary in order to protect the health and safety of  our\r\n\r\nconsumers, and I think every country practises this to a greater\r\n\r\nor lesser degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SELECTIVE EN-BLOC REDEVELOPMENT SCHEME IN HILLVIEW ESTATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  whether he is willing to exclude the three  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development Board point block flats, namely Blocks  12,  13\r\n\r\nand   14   of  Hillview  Estate,  from  the  Selective   En-bloc\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Selective En-bloc\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Scheme (SERS) is a \"win-win\" situation  for  both\r\n\r\nthe  nation  as a whole and the affected residents.  With  SERS,\r\n\r\nthe Government can renew and rejuvenate older HDB estates.  More\r\n\r\nflats of improved design can be built to make better use of  our\r\n\r\nlimited  land.   This  will  also encourage  and  allow  younger\r\n\r\nfamilies to move into these older estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The affected residents enjoy many benefits under SERS.\r\n\r\nThey  can  move to newer and better HDB flats, with a fresh  99-year  lease, at subsidised selling prices.  They are also  given\r\n\r\nmarket  compensation for their existing flats as at the time  of\r\n\r\nannouncement  of SERS.  Those who are eligible  to  buy  a  flat\r\n\r\ndirectly from HDB can enjoy a further 20% discount, subject to a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  $30,000, off the selling prices of the  replacement\r\n\r\nflats.   In  addition, SERS lessees need not move out  of  their\r\n\r\nexisting flats until their replacement flats\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  ready.  In most instances, the replacement flats are  built\r\n\r\nin  close proximity to their existing flats so they do not  have\r\n\r\nto move out of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the announcement of SERS in 1995, 31 sites involving\r\n\r\nsome  12,500 HDB sold flats have been identified for the Scheme.\r\n\r\nThey  are  located in the older HDB estates such as  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nBukit  Merah, Bedok, Jurong, Toa Payoh, Kallang/Whampoa and  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Area.   SERS  has been well received  by  the  affected\r\n\r\nlessees in these precincts.  For all the SERS sites announced so\r\n\r\nfar,  the  average support level from affected lessees is  above\r\n\r\n90%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SERS for Hillview Estate was announced on 21st March\r\n\r\n1999.   It  involves the entire Hillview Estate,  comprising  12\r\n\r\nsold   apartment  blocks,  one  rental  apartment   block,   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood centre and the Bukit Gombak Community Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB conducted a survey among the affected flat lessees\r\n\r\nafter the announcement.  As at 28th June 1999, 86% of them  have\r\n\r\nresponded to the survey.  Of these, 86% are in support of  SERS.\r\n\r\nAmong  the five-roomers at Blocks 12 to 14, 70% supported  SERS.\r\n\r\nThe scheme has clear support from the majority of residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I understand that a small group of residents\r\n\r\nare unhappy with the scheme for various reasons.

HDB will be providing some 4-room and 5-room new\r\n\r\nreplacement flats which will have slightly bigger floor areas to\r\n\r\nmatch the current flat sizes in these two areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the premium and levy, to help the\r\n\r\nresidents  affected by the HDB's revised resale levy policy,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry has decided to give them the option to pay the standard\r\n\r\n20%  premium  on the selling price of the replacement  flats  in\r\n\r\nview  of the revised resale levy.  This would help some  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents pay a lower amount.  The resale premium will  also  be\r\n\r\nincorporated  as  part of the selling price of  the  replacement\r\n\r\nflat.   In  this way, it can be paid either through the Members'\r\n\r\nCPF  accounts or they can get a mortgage loan from  HDB  to  pay\r\n\r\nthis  amount.   Those who opt to pay the resale  levy  can  also\r\n\r\ncontra  the payment from the compensation that they will receive\r\n\r\nfor  the  sale of their existing flats.  So this is in  lieu  of\r\n\r\npaying cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further help their cashflow, my Ministry will also allow\r\n\r\naffected residents who are liable for resale premium or deferred\r\n\r\nlevy to pay only $30,000 of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npremium  or  levy  upfront.  The rest  of  the  amount  will  be\r\n\r\ndeferred.   This will be held as a contingent liability  by  the\r\n\r\nHDB  which  will only need to be paid if and when they  sell  or\r\n\r\ntransfer  the  replacement  flat allocated  under  SERS.   As  a\r\n\r\ngoodwill  gesture, HDB will not charge interest on the  deferred\r\n\r\namount.  These concessions are also extended to affected lessees\r\n\r\nin  other  SERS sites announced earlier if they are in the  same\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the question of mortgage loan, HDB will also be\r\n\r\nconsidering  on  a  case-by-case basis to  provide  up  to  100%\r\n\r\nmortgage  loan for the purchase of replacement flats.  HDB  will\r\n\r\ngive fuller details of these changes later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for SERS lessees who are singles, HDB has decided that\r\n\r\nit  will  not extend the full rehousing benefits to them because\r\n\r\nas  it  is,  under SERS, singles are already enjoying some  very\r\n\r\nmajor concessions.  For example, they are now able to get a  new\r\n\r\nreplacement  flat  as a single lessee and this  new  replacement\r\n\r\nflat  will  of  course be at subsidised prices.  They  are  also\r\n\r\nallowed  to  buy  a new 4-room flat and, as the  Member  may  be\r\n\r\naware,  under normal circumstances, singles are not eligible  to\r\n\r\nbuy  a  new flat directly from HDB and even then, they can  only\r\n\r\nbuy up to a 3-room resale flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked about shops in the area. The\r\n\r\nassessment of HDB is that in the new redeveloped area, there are\r\n\r\nsufficient  shops  and  eating houses in  the  vicinity  of  the\r\n\r\nreplacement  site.   So  HDB  has  not  planned  to  build   any\r\n\r\ncommercial  facilities  there.  But  in  view  of  the  Member's\r\n\r\nappeal, I will ask HDB to look into the feasibility of providing\r\n\r\na few shops in the area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, these three blocks\r\n\r\nof  flats  are point block flats.  They have 25 levels each  and\r\n\r\nare  densely occupied.  Also, Sir, there are precedents in other\r\n\r\nplaces,  which have been compulsorily acquired, where the  point\r\n\r\nblock  flats  are left alone.  For example, at  Depot  Road  and\r\n\r\nTeochew Street, the point block flats which are densely occupied\r\n\r\nare not demolished.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can you proceed with your question?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> My question is, in view of the fact\r\n\r\nthat HDB is going to use the land at Hillview Estate intensively\r\n\r\nand that these point block flats are already an intensive use of\r\n\r\nthe land, why can they not be left alone?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the first point that Mr Chiam made\r\n\r\nwas  that  these flats are already densely built  and  therefore\r\n\r\nthey  should  be left alone.  That is not the only consideration\r\n\r\nin  so  far  as  the  redevelopment of the  Hillview  Estate  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.   If  Mr Chiam is familiar with Hillview  Estate,  he\r\n\r\nwill realise that that estate is quite separate from the rest of\r\n\r\nthe  estate.  So one of the considerations has been that if  the\r\n\r\nthree  point block flats are left remaining behind as HDB flats,\r\n\r\nthe  maintenance and redevelopment of the area will  not  be  as\r\n\r\noptimal as they should be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also complaints about the flats in the area in so\r\n\r\nfar  as the condition of the flats is concerned.  Many residents\r\n\r\nhave  given feedback to the Member of Parliament that there  are\r\n\r\nproblems  with maintenance, public transport facilities  in  the\r\n\r\narea,  and so on.  So this is the other consideration  that  was\r\n\r\ntaken  into account in the overall redevelopment of the  estate.\r\n\r\nIt is of course not a hard and fast rule because it depends very\r\n\r\nmuch  on different estates in different areas.  Indeed, Mr Chiam\r\n\r\nmentioned  two  other places where point block  flats  were  not\r\n\r\ninvolved  in SERS.  So it really depends on what the  plans  are\r\n\r\nfor  the  overall  redevelopment of the estate and  whether  the\r\n\r\nexistence   of  these  point  block  flats  would   hinder   the\r\n\r\nredevelopment plans.  It is for these reasons that consideration\r\n\r\nwas  given  to the inclusion of the three point block  flats  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, of course, ultimately, when the\r\n\r\nresidents  were polled for their response to the SERS programme,\r\n\r\nthe  response in these point block flats also indicated that the\r\n\r\nclear  majority of the residents do support the SERS  programme.\r\n\r\nThere are some residents I know in the point block flats who are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagainst the redevelopment of their blocks.  However, we have  to\r\n\r\nbear  in  mind  that  the  whole  SERS  programme  is  a  public\r\n\r\nredevelopment programme that is intended to generate benefits to\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of the residents as well as to the nation.   Yes,\r\n\r\nthere  are  some people who are against the SERS scheme.   As  I\r\n\r\nhave indicated earlier, we will try our best to mitigate some of\r\n\r\ntheir concerns.  But it is not possible for us to stop the  SERS\r\n\r\nprogramme for these three blocks just because of a few residents\r\n\r\nwho are against the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I do not know how the Minister\r\n\r\narrived  at  this 70% approval.  But from our own  research,  we\r\n\r\nfound  that  almost everyone we approached was not  happy  about\r\n\r\nmoving out from these point block flats.  They stand to lose  an\r\n\r\naverage ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can I ask you to proceed to your\r\n\r\nsupplementary question.

They  already  lose\r\n\r\n$60,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, if you have no question, I will ask\r\n\r\nyou to resume your seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have a question, Sir. I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  when would these buildings be demolished.  I just  want\r\n\r\nanother  clarification.  He said that the floor  area  would  be\r\n\r\nbigger.   Is  this  in respect of the new flats  that  they  are\r\n\r\nmoving to or the ones that are going to be rebuilt?  If they are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  for  the rebuilt flats, it does not  benefit  the\r\n\r\nresidents there now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Let me try and answer Mr Chiam's\r\n\r\nquestions.  The first\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\none  is  on the support level.  What HDB does is to send  out  a\r\n\r\nsurvey form to each of the residents and the residents are asked\r\n\r\nto  indicate, among other things, whether they support the  SERS\r\n\r\nscheme  and  also  what  kind of flat types  they  want  in  the\r\n\r\nreplacement site.  This is to facilitate the planning for  flats\r\n\r\nin  the replacement site. The returns are collected and collated\r\n\r\nby  HDB and that is how we get the 70%.  It is not a figment  of\r\n\r\nmy  imagination.  It is part of a survey done by HDB.  It is  in\r\n\r\nwriting  and  all the residents actually signed the returns  and\r\n\r\nindicated in writing whether they support or otherwise.   So  it\r\n\r\nis, I believe, a fairly reliable indicator of the support level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that he made is that residents who had\r\n\r\nbought  at  $360,000 will now get compensation of  $300,000.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that  is  only half the story.  If he  goes  into  it  in\r\n\r\ngreater  detail, he will find that the majority of the residents\r\n\r\nwill  come out very much ahead.  They will get a new flat.  They\r\n\r\nwill get a flat which has got a brand new lease.  They will  get\r\n\r\na  new  subsidised  flat  in a better area.   They  will  get  a\r\n\r\ndiscount  of  20% over and above all that, plus  all  the  other\r\n\r\nbenefits.   It is a deal which is simply too good to refuse  for\r\n\r\nmany  people.  But there are a few, as I have indicated earlier,\r\n\r\nwho  may still not be happy with the total package.  We will try\r\n\r\nand help them.  But, by and large, the majority of the residents\r\n\r\ndo  benefit  from  the SERS scheme and that  is  indicated  very\r\n\r\nclearly  by the kind of written support level that we have  been\r\n\r\ngetting over the last 30-over sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as floor areas are concerned, it is for the new\r\n\r\nreplacement  flats  because there were some  concerns  that  the\r\n\r\nreplacement  flats  in  some cases may  be  too  small  for  the\r\n\r\nresidents  in  Hillview Estate.  Mr Ang Mong  Seng  did  make  a\r\n\r\nrepresentation and HDB has found it possible to build a  few  of\r\n\r\nthese  larger flats.  Not everybody would be interested in these\r\n\r\nflats, but for a few of them who are interested, HDB has found a\r\n\r\nway  to  cater to their interest.  So these are for  replacement\r\n\r\nflats, not for the existing flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would HDB consider building larger\r\n\r\nflats in new estates if there is such a demand?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Very good question. I have asked HDB that\r\n\r\nmyself.   The  design of the new estates will take into  account\r\n\r\nthe  demands for the new flat types that are being requested  by\r\n\r\nresidents, not just the size of the flat but also the pricing of\r\n\r\nthe flat.  So in this regard, the sizes that are being built  in\r\n\r\nthe  new  estates are just right, not only in terms of household\r\n\r\nfamily  size, but also in terms of pricing.  We can build  flats\r\n\r\nwhich are much larger than what they are today.  But at the  end\r\n\r\nof  the day, there are so many types of flats and so many number\r\n\r\nof  flats  that we can build of that particular  size.   We  can\r\n\r\nbuild  all  5-room flats of 150 sq metres.  But  there  will  be\r\n\r\nfewer 5-room flats for us to build.  Then what?  After that, the\r\n\r\nMP  will  come back and make a representation on behalf  of  his\r\n\r\nresidents who cannot get flats.  Our policy is very simple.   We\r\n\r\nwill  try  and house as many Singaporeans as possible  in  flats\r\n\r\nwhich are comfortable, which meet their requirements and, at the\r\n\r\nsame time, are affordable.  These are the key criteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Three more supplementary questions,\r\n\r\nSir.

And third, I believe in  the  last  general\r\n\r\nelections, the residents there were promised upgrading.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the former Minister for\r\n\r\nInformation  and the Arts had announced in this  House  on  12th\r\n\r\nMarch  1999  that  the Government planned  to  develop  a  Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage  Centre which would involve conserving and redeveloping\r\n\r\nthe Istana Kampong Glam and the adjoining Lot 53.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will also recall that on 15th April 1999, I\r\n\r\ninformed  the  House  of the Government's proposed  new  payment\r\n\r\nscheme under the Sultan Hussain Ordinance.  This Bill is to give\r\n\r\neffect to that proposed new scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained in this House on 15th April 1999, there are\r\n\r\nsome  79  beneficiaries  who are receiving  payments  under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, many of whom are not residing in Singapore.  Of those\r\n\r\nwho are residents in Singapore, only a handful (14) are actually\r\n\r\nliving  in the former Istana Kampong Glam.  The former  Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development, Mr S Dhanabalan, had explained to this\r\n\r\nHouse  on 12th March 1991 that the Kampong Glam Estate including\r\n\r\nthe  former Istana had reverted to the State as confirmed by the\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeal in 1897.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sultan Hussain Ordinance was enacted to take care of\r\n\r\nthe financial needs of the late Sultan Hussain's family at that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime.   Since  then,  the number of beneficiaries  has  steadily\r\n\r\nincreased  and the payments have been diminishing as the  income\r\n\r\nfrom  which  the  payments were made declined.   The  individual\r\n\r\npayments  would become even smaller over time if the  number  of\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  increases.  The Government had therefore  decided\r\n\r\nto  implement  a new scheme that would work to the advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  beneficiaries.   Under  this scheme,  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nincrease the amount of payment from the current level of $29,231\r\n\r\nper annum to $350,000 per annum, which is more than 10 times the\r\n\r\ncurrent annual payment.  This revised sum will be maintained for\r\n\r\na  fixed  period  of  30 years, starting  from  this  year.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the Government will offer any beneficiary the  option\r\n\r\nof  receiving a lump sum payment up-front instead.  The lump sum\r\n\r\nwould  be equivalent to the present value of the 30-year payment\r\n\r\nstream.  From the beneficiaries' point of view, this would  work\r\n\r\nout to be more advantageous than the current system of receiving\r\n\r\na dwindling annual sum indefinitely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office has informed all the beneficiaries of the\r\n\r\nproposed  new  scheme.  So far, an overwhelming majority  of  64\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  or  81% have informed the Land Office  that  they\r\n\r\nwish  to opt for lump sum payment.  When the amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  come  into  force,  payments  can  be  made  to   the\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  who have opted for a lump sum payment  under  the\r\n\r\nnew scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to the actual provisions of the Bill, new\r\n\r\nsection 4A enables the establishment of the proposed new payment\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed scheme will apply to members of the family of\r\n\r\nthe late Sultan Hussain who, before 4th May 1999, were receiving\r\n\r\nan annuity under the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 4A provides that sections 3 and 4 of the main\r\n\r\nOrdinance  shall cease to have effect on the day the new  scheme\r\n\r\nis  established.   What this means, Sir, is  that  the  existing\r\n\r\nscheme of payments will cease upon the establishment of the  new\r\n\r\nimproved scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing section 4 of the main Ordinance also contains\r\n\r\nthe declaration that the lands in Kampong Glam were Crown lands.\r\n\r\nThe  amending  Bill  does  not in  any  way  derogate  from  the\r\n\r\nlegislative  effect of that declaration.  That  declaration  had\r\n\r\ncome  into  effect when the Ordinance was enacted in 1904.   The\r\n\r\nlands remain as State lands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 4A also provides for regulations to be made\r\n\r\nfor the detailed implementation of the new scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nInformation and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof) (In  Malay):   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to join in\r\n\r\nthe  debate.   I support the proposed Sultan Hussain (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  1999  tabled by the Minister for Law and wish to  give  my\r\n\r\nopinion on the Malay Heritage Centre project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law, in his speech in Parliament on 15th\r\n\r\nApril,  mentioned about the new payment scheme under the  Sultan\r\n\r\nHussain   Ordinance.   Today's  debate  is  held  to  pass   the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.   I  support that this scheme  be  enforced  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of its recipients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy when I heard the Minister's statement that the\r\n\r\nmajority (64 people or 81%) of the descendants had informed  the\r\n\r\nLand Office that they had opted to receive lump sum payments.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve they have made careful consideration on the advantage of\r\n\r\nthe  option  over  annual payments.  The  increasing  number  of\r\n\r\ndescendants  and  inflation have caused the annual  payments  to\r\n\r\ndecrease  to  an  insignificant sum.  They must have  definitely\r\n\r\nconsidered this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in my opinion, the offer under the new scheme\r\n\r\nis  very  attractive, especially on the lump sum payment option.\r\n\r\nAt  a  rough estimate, the payment under the new scheme, if paid\r\n\r\nannually, will total about $10.5 million.  (This is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbased  on  an  annuity of $350,000 annually for 30  years.)   If\r\n\r\nshared among 79 people, it means every person will receive about\r\n\r\n$133,000 each.  We are also told that a majority of them do  not\r\n\r\neven live in Singapore.  (If some of them live in Malaysia, this\r\n\r\nmeans that they will receive about RM$295,000).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount is not small. I am confident that such a hefty\r\n\r\nsum  is  offered  based on the Government's spirit  of  goodwill\r\n\r\ntowards  the  descendants.   This  is  in  accordance  with  the\r\n\r\noriginal  spirit  of  the  formulation  of  the  Sultan  Hussain\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  which  is to meet the financial needs  of  the  late\r\n\r\nSultan Hussain and his descendants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the main issue that emerges from this proposed\r\n\r\namendment  is actually connected to new section 4 which  retains\r\n\r\nthe  declaration that lands, as mentioned in one part of the old\r\n\r\nsection 4, in the Kampong Glam area remain as lands belonging to\r\n\r\nthe  British  government (Crown lands).  The Minister  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  the Bill that was tabled does not in any way derogate from\r\n\r\nthe  legislative effect of that part of section 4  which  states\r\n\r\nthat  these  lands are Crown lands.  This section   took  effect\r\n\r\nwhen the Ordinance was drawn up a long time ago and hence, these\r\n\r\nlands now remain as State land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the legal position, whether of the original\r\n\r\nlaw or the amended one, is clear, that these lands are no longer\r\n\r\nthe  property  of any descendants of Sultan Hussain.   This  was\r\n\r\ndecided  by  the  Court of Appeal in 1897 and remains  effective\r\n\r\ntoday.   As  far  as I am aware, the legitimacy has  never  been\r\n\r\nchallenged in court in the last 100 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the issue is very clear, I am disappointed to find\r\n\r\nthat  there are certain quarters in Malaysia who have taken  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  try  to confuse public  opinion  in  their  own\r\n\r\ninterest and for their own benefit.  I refer to Malaysian TV and\r\n\r\nprint media that distort facts, coming up with what is not there\r\n\r\nand  burying  the  truth.   After the Government  announced  the\r\n\r\nKampong  Glam Malay Heritage Centre project, it seems  that  the\r\n\r\nmedia in that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountry  is  very enthusiastic in having coverage of the  issue.\r\n\r\nWhat  disappoints me is that most of the news reported  are  not\r\n\r\ntrue.  Among those reported are, first, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Residents also reject the government's offer to pay\r\n\r\nUS$350,000  (RM782,340) to them in the period of 30  years.'   - Utusan Malaysia, 3rd May 1999, page 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is totally incorrect.  The actual amount is S$350,000  per\r\n\r\nyear  for 30 years, and the total amount is estimated at  S$10.5\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, that the Istana Kampong Glam, \"Singapore's last\r\n\r\nMalay  bastion  will  be destroyed\"  -   front  page  of  Utusan\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  13th  May  1999.   We, in Singapore,  know  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  spend  millions of  dollars  to  conserve  and\r\n\r\nrestore Istana Kampong Glam as a Malay Heritage Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Mingguan Malaysia dated 9th May 1999, pages 24 and\r\n\r\n25, published a two-page article entitled \"The disappearance  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Malay  bastion\"  and  \"300  descendants  of  Sultan\r\n\r\nHussain  refuse to move out to preserve the historical  heritage\r\n\r\nof  the  Malay  sultanate.\"  It quoted someone saying  that  the\r\n\r\nIstana  Kampong Glam project would end and erase the  historical\r\n\r\nheritage  of  the  Singapore Malay sultanate.    Fourth,  Utusan\r\n\r\nMalaysia, 14th May 1999, published a letter from a reader  named\r\n\r\nZia-Ul-Arief with a sensational news headline, \"Singapore  wants\r\n\r\nthe  history of Malay supremacy to vanish\" on page  7.   Let  me\r\n\r\nquote some of the fiery words used:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Istana Kampong Glam episode in Singapore is a tragic\r\n\r\nincident  about the fate of the Malay race.  It is not about  an\r\n\r\nold  building being demolished for development purposes  but   a\r\n\r\nfinal  episode  to eliminate the history of Malay  supremacy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore's intention to build the Singapore Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage Centre is merely an excuse.  To it, the Malays have  no\r\n\r\nright to step in Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Finally, the Malays in Temasek will disappear with time.'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Malay community must realise and understand. If the\r\n\r\nMalay  race  is  destroyed, our supremacy in this  country  will\r\n\r\nvanish.   Perhaps the words of Hang Tuah that 'the  Malays  will\r\n\r\nnot  disappear from the world'  will not be a reality in Temasek\r\n\r\nand our homeland.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I find such words are highly inflammatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, Awang Sulung in his column Bisik-bisik or Whispers\r\n\r\nin  Utusan Malaysia and Utusan Melayu dated 4th June, made these\r\n\r\ncomments:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As expected, the descendants of Sultan Hussain Shah who\r\n\r\nlive  in  Istana Kampong Glam in Singapore will not be  able  to\r\n\r\nbear  up  for  long  in their struggle to defend  their  istana.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they  will have to be content with  some  compensation\r\n\r\nthat does not match their position as descendants of the sultan.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  have  to  move from  a  \"palace\"  to  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople's  flat.   Thus, that is the end of the  last  symbol  of\r\n\r\nMalay  supremacy in the republic once known as Temasek.  Nothing\r\n\r\ncan  change  the  situation.  The glory of the  past  will  only\r\n\r\nremain a sad memory.  What could be useful to ponder now at this\r\n\r\nsad moment is why the Singapore Malays become like that.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, the word \"seize\" was used repeatedly in several of\r\n\r\ntheir reports.  A commentator of the Analisis programme  by  TV3\r\n\r\nwhich  was  telecast on Wednesday, 30th June at 7.30  pm,  which\r\n\r\ncould be viewed by Singaporeans, made the same allegation.   The\r\n\r\nTV  programme commentator accused the development of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage Centre as \"a subtle move to abolish the only symbol  of\r\n\r\nMalay  glory  in Singapore.\"  Mr Speaker, these allegations  and\r\n\r\nstatements are untruths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, the TV3 commentator also claimed that, \"the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government suddenly seized the Istana and evicted  the\r\n\r\napproximately 300 residents around the Istana.\"   She  added  by\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"the  now powerless descendants of Sultan  Hussain  are\r\n\r\nbeing   trapped  by  the  PAP's  urbanisation  and  resettlement\r\n\r\npolicies.   It is made an excuse to acquire the Malay  sultanate\r\n\r\nland   or   clearly,  Malay  rights.\"   Sir,   this   is   gross\r\n\r\nmispresentation of facts.  The fact is that the former  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Information and the Arts, BG George Yeo, had announced  the\r\n\r\nformation of a committee to study the development of the  Istana\r\n\r\nKampong Glam as a Malay Heritage Centre as early as seven years\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nago.   As  far  as  I can remember, the number of  residents  of\r\n\r\nIstana Kampong Glam that are affected by the resettlement is 170\r\n\r\npersons,  not  300, as claimed.  Why do they have  to  lie?   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, we know what is going on by the look of things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighth, is it appropriate for Zain Mahmud, an ex-senior\r\n\r\nofficer in the former Radio and Television Singapore who is  now\r\n\r\na Malaysian citizen, to write in MASSA (issue of 26th June 1999)\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Singapore  forces the heirs of the  former  Sultan  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to break up and move to flats to enable the inherited\r\n\r\nIstana  to be made into a Malay Heritage Centre.  Could this  be\r\n\r\nseen  as  a move to put the Malays into the museum?\"  Are  these\r\n\r\nwords not mischievous,  to say the least?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the list of media reports which I quoted\r\n\r\nearlier shows that they have an axe to grind.  The setting up of\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  Heritage Centre at Istana Kampong Glam  is  part  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  national  project.  The problem  arising  from  the\r\n\r\nresettlement of Istana Kampong Glam's residents is  an  internal\r\n\r\naffair  of  Singapore.   Such false and  distorted  articles  on\r\n\r\nsensitive matters, on our internal matters are trying to sow the\r\n\r\nseed  of  discord and stir up ill feelings between  races  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  Singapore.   Singaporeans  have  to  be   vigilant\r\n\r\nagainst  such attempts.  We in Singapore must not be trapped  by\r\n\r\ntheir  remarks because we in Singapore know the facts,  and  are\r\n\r\naware of the truth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me add that these acts of interference in\r\n\r\nour  internal affairs were made at a time when their leaders and\r\n\r\ntheir  media took exception and strongly criticised the Business\r\n\r\nTimes editorial recently, while at the same time they were doing\r\n\r\nwhat  they  were  condemning.  Is this not  sheer  hypocrisy  or\r\n\r\ndouble standards?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Malay Heritage Centre has actually\r\n\r\nreceived wide support of the Malay community.  Allow me to quote\r\n\r\nthe  words  of  Haji Ridzwan Dzafir, the Chairman of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage Foundation, last Friday in Berita Harian:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Malay community accepts the proposal well. This is a\r\n\r\nmajor  opportunity  for  us to develop a Malay  Heritage  Centre\r\n\r\nbased  on  our  own  knowledge, and we will  also  invite  Malay\r\n\r\nexperts  in  all areas of history.  We will surely  be  able  to\r\n\r\nmanage it well.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  have  not  actually heard the Malay population  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nexpressing  their  displeasure  on  the  Malay  Heritage  Centre\r\n\r\nproject   in   Istana   Kampong  Glam.    The   willingness   of\r\n\r\ndistinguished,    highly   qualified   and    independent-minded\r\n\r\nprofessionals  to  sit on the Board of Directors  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage  Centre  is proof of the strong support  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity for the project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we should not lose sight of the underlying\r\n\r\nreasons for the setting up of the Malay Heritage Centre and  why\r\n\r\nthe  Istana  Kampong  Glam was chosen as the  site.   The  Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage  Centre is intended to complement the  museums  of  the\r\n\r\nNational  Heritage  Board.   It will  capture  the  history  and\r\n\r\ncultural  heritage  of  the Malays in Singapore  and  trace  its\r\n\r\nlinkages with kinsmen in this region and beyond.  Personally,  I\r\n\r\nsee it as our way of showing respect for the past, including the\r\n\r\nhistory  of the Malay sultanate, just as we appreciate our  past\r\n\r\nby not changing the names of our roads and streets, because they\r\n\r\nare  part of our heritage.  It is also our way of preserving our\r\n\r\nculture  and  heritage and to share it with fellow Singaporeans,\r\n\r\npeople in this region and the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not forget that Istana Kampong Glam is located in\r\n\r\nthe  midst  of a historic area bordered by Rochore  Road,  Beach\r\n\r\nRoad, Jalan Sultan and Victoria Street.  Its choice as the Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage Centre itself is an opportunity to turn it into a major\r\n\r\nlandmark.   For  it  was  an area that  had  located  the  Malay\r\n\r\nSultanate.   It  was  also a place, the vicinity  of  which  had\r\n\r\nwitnessed  the birth of Malay/Muslim entrepreneurs, businessmen,\r\n\r\nwriters,  printers,  haj agencies, together  with  the  rise  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  education  centres, publishing  houses,  a  place  where\r\n\r\nsongkoks  were made, Malay leather slipper-making, polishing  of\r\n\r\ndiamonds,  sailing and accommodation of travellers.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nheartbeat  of the Malays of the olden days.  This is the  spirit\r\n\r\nwe wish to revive as we face the new millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Sultan Hussain (Amendment) Bill proposed by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Law based on the explanation and clarification\r\n\r\nmade  by  him  when  he  brought forward the  proposed  Bill  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the proposal was read in Parliament, I went down to\r\n\r\nvarious  coffeeshops, hawker centres and places of  worship.   I\r\n\r\nfound  out  that not even one member of the Malay  community  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  questioned  the status of the  Istana  Kampong  Glam.\r\n\r\nOnly  a  handful  of  individuals wanted to  know  the  type  of\r\n\r\ncompensation to be given to the rightful descendants  of  Sultan\r\n\r\nHussain.   The  majority of them welcomed the  proposal  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law because the Malay community had long  thought\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has to do something about  Istana  Kampong\r\n\r\nGlam.    They  also  wanted  to  know  whether  the   cost   for\r\n\r\nrefurbishing and preserving the Istana is sufficient and how the\r\n\r\nMalay community could raise funds for the Malay Heritage Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, I wish to pose several questions to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law.  Even though we have  heard  about  the  new\r\n\r\npayment scheme mentioned by Mr Yatiman Yusof, I believe that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  much  better if the Minister for  Law  himself  could\r\n\r\nexplain further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Am I right that the proposal made by the Minister is in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the law and not based on the whims and  fancies\r\n\r\nwithout  taking  any  consideration  of  the  interest  of   the\r\n\r\ndescendants of Sultan Hussain?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is it true that the descendants of Sultan Hussain are\r\n\r\nforced to move out without being fairly compensated?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Is it true that they have been poorly compensated?\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Minister  can  give us  some  information  on  the\r\n\r\nresettlement progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, slanted and distorted reports in the newspapers and\r\n\r\ntelevision in Malaysia, particularly a TV3 programme  which  was\r\n\r\ntelecast  on  30th  June 1999, appear to have the  objective  of\r\n\r\nbringing about uncomfortable feelings among the Malay community.\r\n\r\nAlso,  there  will be bad elements from those outside  Singapore\r\n\r\nwanting  to  shake  our racial harmony through  their  atrocious\r\n\r\narticles and statements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who wish to do such a thing should realise that\r\n\r\nSingapore Malays value the importance of education and  tertiary\r\n\r\nlearning.  Do  not  make the Malays as pawns in  their  game  of\r\n\r\nchess.   We  have  learnt a lot from past experience  where  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"race\"  and \"religion\" had been used by certain  quarters\r\n\r\nfor their interest. The Singapore Malays are now open-minded and\r\n\r\nrational in their thinking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign media, whether in print or electronic, should\r\n\r\nnot  interfere  with  the internal affairs of  Singapore.   When\r\n\r\nSingapore  newspapers  made inadvertent  mistakes  in  reporting\r\n\r\nabout  their country, not only their media were angry  but  also\r\n\r\ntheir  leaders  will condemn Singapore and insinuate  about  our\r\n\r\nleaders.   It  is best that the media of the said  country  find\r\n\r\nways to overcome their problems pertaining to housing, drugs  or\r\n\r\nthe  education  of the Malay community as voiced  out  by  their\r\n\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Malay community is aware of the game played\r\n\r\nby  the  media of our neighbour.  Remember, the Singapore Malays\r\n\r\nare not the pawns in the game of chess of the said country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the amendment to the Sultan Hussain Ordinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member of Parliament for Kampong Glam,\r\n\r\nobviously I have a very keen interest in the issue of this  very\r\n\r\nsensitive and delicate nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In introducing the new scheme for the payment of annuity or\r\n\r\ncommuted gratuity\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the  family  of the late Sultan Hussain, the Government  has\r\n\r\nincreased  the quantum from $250,000, last revised in  1991,  to\r\n\r\n$350,000  this year.  This amount is fixed for a  period  of  30\r\n\r\nyears.   The  eligible  persons are also  given  the  option  of\r\n\r\nreceiving a lump sum payment upfront.  The next-of-kin or estate\r\n\r\nis  assured  of  the  annuity even on the death  of  the  person\r\n\r\neligible for payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known from the long established records that the\r\n\r\nintention of the Sultan Hussain Ordinance enacted in 1904 was to\r\n\r\ntake  care  of  the financial needs of the family  of  the  late\r\n\r\nSultan  Hussain at that time.  I think the emphasis is \"at  that\r\n\r\ntime\".   The  then  British  Governor described  them  as  \"very\r\n\r\nimprovident people\".  These payments were not intended to be  in\r\n\r\nperpetuity  but  made  only to the family  of  the  late  Sultan\r\n\r\nHussain at the time the Ordinance was enacted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been generous in continuing with the\r\n\r\npractice   of  paying  the  allowance  even  to  the  subsequent\r\n\r\ngenerations  of the late Sultan Hussain's family.  This  payment\r\n\r\nof  allowance  should  have  stopped with  the  original  family\r\n\r\nmembers  at the time of 1904.  Many descendants could have  been\r\n\r\nbetter  off  over the years and are no longer improvident.   Yet\r\n\r\nthe  Government continues to pay them the allowance irrespective\r\n\r\nof  their wealth and status.  A number of beneficiaries also  no\r\n\r\nlonger  reside in Singapore, yet the Government gives  them  the\r\n\r\nallowance regardless of where they are.  In fact, our Government\r\n\r\nhas  done more than meeting its basic legal obligations  to  the\r\n\r\nfamily  of  the late Sultan Hussain.  The gesture  and  goodwill\r\n\r\ndemonstrated by our Government reflects its care and concern for\r\n\r\nthe well being of the late Sultan Hussain's family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my two colleagues have alluded to earlier about the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  media, the Malaysian TV3 Malay programme,  Viewpoint,\r\n\r\ndid  the  interview  with the Chairman of  the  Singapore  Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage Foundation, Mr Ridzwan Dzafir on 10th June\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n1999.  The  topic discussed was the redevelopment of the  former\r\n\r\nIstana  Kampong Glam as the Malay Heritage Centre.  I  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  read  the  full  transcript  of  Mr   Ridzwan's\r\n\r\ninterview.   It is amazing how TV3 has distorted a  very  candid\r\n\r\nand honest expression of the vision of the Malay Heritage Centre\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Through selective quotation, TV3 has done a great\r\n\r\ndisservice   to  their  Malay  viewers  both  in  Malaysia   and\r\n\r\nSingapore.    Clearly,  the  Malaysian  TV  channel   has   been\r\n\r\nmischievous, misleading and provocative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are aware, the Malaysian political leaders took\r\n\r\numbrage  at  the  Business Times' editorial on  the  subject  of\r\n\r\npolitical  succession  in  Malaysia  when  commenting   on   the\r\n\r\nforthcoming Malaysian general elections.  Singapore leaders must\r\n\r\nalso  express our disgust at TV3 for incorrectly and  improperly\r\n\r\ndepicting  the redevelopment of Istana Kampong Glam to  a  Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage  Centre  as  an issue of Malay  rights.   Perhaps,  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Malays are fearful that Singaporeans would do a better\r\n\r\njob  in promoting Malay culture, history and tradition with  our\r\n\r\nMalay Heritage Centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore do not wish to interfere with the domestic\r\n\r\npolitics  in Malaysia.  This is in line with what the  Malaysian\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders  had asked our media not  to  interfere  with\r\n\r\ntheirs.  The Chinese community in Singapore has been careful not\r\n\r\nto  champion  or speak out against the Malaysian authorities  on\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Chinese issues, whether on Kampong  Cina  or  Chinese\r\n\r\nancestral  places in Malacca, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh or Penang.   It\r\n\r\nis  important that the media on both sides be considerate not to\r\n\r\ninterfere in the domestic politics in each neighbouring country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it instructive to learn from the interview that many\r\n\r\nin  the Malay community in Singapore are made up of Arab, Indian\r\n\r\nand  even Chinese origins.  Even as the Singapore Malay  leaders\r\n\r\nexpress  concern  over the trend of young  Malays  knowing  very\r\n\r\nlittle  about  Malay culture and history in Singapore,  we  also\r\n\r\nhave a new generation of young\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnon-Malay  Singaporeans  who do not speak  and  understand  even\r\n\r\nsimple Malay.  The Malay Heritage Centre will not only serve  to\r\n\r\neducate young Malays but will also promote better knowledge  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  in the Malay heritage among Chinese,  Indian  and\r\n\r\nother  Singaporeans.  We must continue to work hard  to  promote\r\n\r\nand  sustain  the inter-racial harmony into the  psyche  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture generations of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a number of residents of Istana Kampong Glam have\r\n\r\nreceived  resettlement notices.  I wish to  find  out  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister the progress of the resettlement exercise of my Kampong\r\n\r\nGlam  residents.   Are  all residents  in  Istana  Kampong  Glam\r\n\r\neligible for their resettlement benefits?  Will they be able  to\r\n\r\nafford the HDB flats with the resettlement benefits given?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can give us an update of the\r\n\r\nresettlement of the Istana Kampong Glam residents.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been many discussions, both in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  quite surprisingly and cheekily across the Causeway,  about\r\n\r\nthe  many implications of this Bill.  But I would like to  touch\r\n\r\non  a  few  issues that were not covered by perhaps the previous\r\n\r\nthree speakers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the overall intention of the Bill, that is, to\r\n\r\nsupport  the overall conservation and preservation of the  area,\r\n\r\nand specifically Istana Kampong Glam.  But here I would like  to\r\n\r\ngive four points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think this is not about the interest of the\r\n\r\ndescendants of the late Sultan Hussain.  This is also not  about\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the Malay community.  I think this is about the\r\n\r\ninterest of Singaporeans as a whole.  All Singaporeans  have  an\r\n\r\ninterest in that area, in Istana Kampong Glam, because it is our\r\n\r\nshared  heritage of past history which we want to  preserve,  to\r\n\r\nreflect and share not only to record the historical developments\r\n\r\nof this country\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbut also as preservation for our future generations.  So this is\r\n\r\nabout Singapore as a whole.  The development of Singapore is not\r\n\r\njust  the  role played by Singaporeans.  It has been  played  by\r\n\r\nmany people in the region, including the Sultanate of Johor, who\r\n\r\nare  still  in  Johor Baru, in Malaysia, including other  people\r\n\r\nfrom  India,  from countries as far as Arabia,  China,  Myanmar,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  British interest.  And here I want  to  make  it\r\n\r\nclear  that  in  the best interest of these people  who  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger Singaporeans, whether British interest or state of  Johor\r\n\r\nand  their  descendants, the best is in  keeping  this  interest\r\n\r\nalive,  by  making  sure that the historical  improvements,  the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of the Malay Heritage Centre, are done well,  that\r\n\r\nwill reflect their role in the development of Singapore.  To  do\r\n\r\notherwise, to sabotage and cast all types of allegations is  not\r\n\r\nserving  their  best  interest, let  alone  our  own  collective\r\n\r\ninterest.   And this is where I appeal to all parties  who  have\r\n\r\nmade statements, including Singaporeans, to see this in a larger\r\n\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that this project represents an\r\n\r\nopportunity.  Some people have forgotten that, and that is,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  purpose of the Heritage Centre cannot be achieved without\r\n\r\nthe  cooperation of the people I have mentioned, who have  taken\r\n\r\npart  in this historical development of Singapore.  In order  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  more than just a museum, but a living archive  of  our\r\n\r\npast, we need the cooperation of the Sultanate of Johor and  the\r\n\r\nmany descendants all around to be part of this project.  I think\r\n\r\nit  represents  a  wonderful opportunity for all  of  us.   That\r\n\r\nspirit of opportunity and cooperation has been lost because each\r\n\r\nof them has got his own specific interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to stress is that there is also a\r\n\r\nrole for the descendants themselves.  I think there is fear that\r\n\r\nby  the  time they are compensated, and relocated, they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  role.   Today,  many of them are staying  there.   They\r\n\r\nactually,  I understand, do still continue to practise  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir very unique court customs and traditions.  And, really,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they have a very large role to play in making  sure  that\r\n\r\nsome of these customs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  traditions are documented, and perhaps even at this  stage,\r\n\r\nthey  can  provide a consultative role in the process.   But  my\r\n\r\nsense  is that if you really want to share with Singaporeans  or\r\n\r\nwith  others who have an interest in Singapore about  our  past,\r\n\r\nwhat  better way than to have people who are familiar  with  the\r\n\r\ncustoms  and  traditions,  people  who  have  linkages,   either\r\n\r\nhistorical  relations or family linkage, to really be  part   of\r\n\r\nthe  process, because they are the best persons to really  share\r\n\r\nwith  Singaporeans what really took place, what are the  customs\r\n\r\nand  traditions.   In the process, I think we can  have  a  more\r\n\r\neffective way of teaching future generations about this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, my fourth point is that we cannot afford not to\r\n\r\nsucceed.   We must succeed.  Some of the reservations  expressed\r\n\r\nby  the  people and community is that, I must say quite frankly,\r\n\r\nthe past project of the Malay Village has raised quite a lot  of\r\n\r\nexpectations.  People wanted the Malay Village to serve  exactly\r\n\r\nthe  same purpose that the Malay Heritage Centre is supposed  to\r\n\r\nserve.   But quite unfortunately, things did not quite work  out\r\n\r\nthe way it should be.  To a lot of people in the community, they\r\n\r\nfeel  this is a last chance as there is no other parcel of land,\r\n\r\nno  other location, where we could preserve this and do  a  very\r\n\r\ngood  exercise.   Therefore, there is a lot of concern  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  it will succeed this time.  I think to  succeed,  we\r\n\r\nmust make sure that every available relevant person is involved,\r\n\r\nthe  resources  of the state are also given,  in  the  sense  of\r\n\r\nexpertise  and  funding, to make sure that we  succeed  in  this\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would just like to end by appealing to the Minister,\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the four points I have mentioned, that perhaps  he\r\n\r\ncould  help to get resources from the other neighbours  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  in  Johor, and how we can borrow some of their  historical\r\n\r\nannals  and archives to preserve that.  I understand  that  some\r\n\r\nare  also  in  Riau.   But,  more  importantly,  are  the  other\r\n\r\nfinancial   resources  and  the  expertise  that  are  currently\r\n\r\navailable in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education\r\n\r\n(Encik  Mohamad Maidin B P M):  Mr Speaker, Sir, I see two  main\r\n\r\nimpact of the proposed amendment:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to establish a new scheme of payment of up to\r\n\r\n$350,000  to  be paid annually to the descendants  of  the  late\r\n\r\nSultan  Hussain  for  up  to 30 years, and  allowing  individual\r\n\r\nbeneficiary to ask for a one-time commuted gratuity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to pave the way for the Istana Kampong Glam\r\n\r\npremises  to  be  conserved and turned  into  a  Malay  Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre,  a  project,  I am sure, Malays in Singapore  and  other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans happily welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, I would like to ask if the Minister could\r\n\r\ninform  the House how much the proposed amendment is  likely  to\r\n\r\ncost  the  Government, aside from the $350,000 gratuity.   There\r\n\r\nare  resettlement benefits involved and resettling those who are\r\n\r\nstill  staying in the Istana compound.  How soon are they likely\r\n\r\nto  vacate  the  place and thus make way for the Malay  Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre project?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am asking these questions partly because I was\r\n\r\ninformed  that not all of them have agreed to accept  the  offer\r\n\r\nmade  by the Land Office.  Some are even thinking of challenging\r\n\r\nthe Government's right to conserve the place and turn it into  a\r\n\r\nHeritage Centre.  In fact, they believe that the Istana and  the\r\n\r\nentire  Kampong  Glam  estate should rightfully  belong  to  the\r\n\r\nSultan's descendants indefinitely.  They maintain that it is not\r\n\r\nstate land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, and to some extent explained by the\r\n\r\nMinister  earlier, it has been over a century long now that  the\r\n\r\nland  in  Kampong  Glam,  including  the  Istana  compound,  had\r\n\r\nreverted to the country - first as Crown land when we were under\r\n\r\nthe  British, and later as State land of independent  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  like to ask again whether this  is  an  accurate\r\n\r\nexplanation of the status of the land, and whether there are any\r\n\r\ndisputes  or  grey areas involved here.  I recall that  sometime\r\n\r\nago  the  Minister had stated the legal position  of  the  land.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  re-state  it  again so that the  descendants  and  other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans could have a clearer picture on this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can say confidently that the Malay community in\r\n\r\nSingapore  look  forward to see an upgraded and improved  Istana\r\n\r\nKampong Glam.  They are also waiting for the day that it becomes\r\n\r\na  heritage centre and hopefully play a major role in preserving\r\n\r\nand propagating the heritage of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geylang Serai may be regarded by many as an emotional\r\n\r\numbilical cord of the Malays in Singapore.  This is due  to  its\r\n\r\nrecent history and the existence of a certain \"Malay flavour\" in\r\n\r\nthe area.  However, the real and actual important history of the\r\n\r\nMalays  and  Singapore  emanated  more  from  the  Kampong  Glam\r\n\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that account alone, I think the Government makes the\r\n\r\nright  decision  by  choosing  to  conserve  and  upgrade   this\r\n\r\nhistorical  district.   Generally, Singaporeans,  including  our\r\n\r\nMalay  community  leaders, accept the  decision.   Kampong  Glam\r\n\r\ndeserves to be awarded that position and status.  We should also\r\n\r\nfind more ways to bring life and add colour to the district.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the media in Malaysia, as mentioned by my\r\n\r\nesteemed  colleague earlier, seem to see it differently,  and  I\r\n\r\nsuspect with some dubious intention.  The most recent example  I\r\n\r\ncould  recall  was a TV3 programme aired on 30th June  1999.   I\r\n\r\nnotice  that  TV3  and  the other media in Malaysia  were  quite\r\n\r\nconsistent in reporting that the whole exercise of setting up  a\r\n\r\nheritage  centre  at  the  old  Istana  was  intended  to  close\r\n\r\npermanently  an important chapter of Singapore's history  linked\r\n\r\nto the Malay kingdom which once ruled this island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how such a thing could possibly be done. As\r\n\r\nfar  as  I  know, history cannot be changed.  It is a well-known\r\n\r\nfact  that  Singapore was once part of the Johor-Riau sultanate,\r\n\r\nthat  we  used  to  be administered from Kota  Tinggi  (the  old\r\n\r\ncapital of Johor) and from Riau.  We also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknow that the powers of the last surviving sultan ended abruptly\r\n\r\nthe day he transferred the administrative power of Singapura  at\r\n\r\nthat  time to the hands of the British, I was told, for a meagre\r\n\r\nsum of $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, if the core ideas of the plan outlined by\r\n\r\nthe  Malay Heritage Centre committee are implemented, I  say  it\r\n\r\nwould only heighten our awareness about that part of Singapore's\r\n\r\nhistory  and  not closing it as a chapter of our  history.   The\r\n\r\nhistory of the Malay sultanate here and its linkage to the Malay\r\n\r\nkings  in  the region, form part of that history.  In fact,  all\r\n\r\nthese  could  be  brought back to life by way of exhibitions  as\r\n\r\nwell  as through dance and drama performances.  I was told there\r\n\r\nwas  even a plan to do further research into the different  sub-ethnic or ethnic groups of the Malay community in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nhow they link up to the whole region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centre would provide Singaporeans from every racial\r\n\r\ngroup,  including  the younger generation of  Malays,  and  even\r\n\r\ntourists  from  every  nation, including Malaysians,  a  greater\r\n\r\nopportunity to have a better understanding of our history.  When\r\n\r\nit  is  ready, I believe, a visitor could practically walk  into\r\n\r\nour past and get a feel of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is most unfair and misleading on the part\r\n\r\nof  the  media in Malaysia to portray the project  in  the  most\r\n\r\nnegative  light.  What they are saying is that because Singapore\r\n\r\nis  not  a  Malay-majority state, it is only  natural  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  here  will  erase any trace  or  symbol  of  history\r\n\r\nlinking this island to the Malay rulers of the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if at all it is true that the Government is race-biased and has ill-intentions against the Malays and their\r\n\r\nhistorical position in our country, I can assure you that I, and\r\n\r\nmost  likely all my Malay MP colleagues, would not  be  here  in\r\n\r\nthis House as a member of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: is the Malaysian media trying to provoke\r\n\r\nthe Malays in Singapore to be angry against our Government over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  issue?   Why  are they against the fact  that  a  Chinese-majority Singapore is making the effort and is willing to  spend\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars to set up a Malay Heritage Centre?   If  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  effort  is  regarded as unthinkable  in  Malaysia,  why\r\n\r\nshould they say it is bad for us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are they saying we want to eradicate Malay history and\r\n\r\nculture  in Singapore when we are actually taking a step further\r\n\r\nto  conserve Kampong Glam into a heritage centre and  giving  it\r\n\r\nthe  pulse it deserves?  If a similar effort is regarded as  not\r\n\r\ndo-able  in Malaysia, why should they say we should not  venture\r\n\r\ninto this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that almost all the media in Malaysia were\r\n\r\nsaying  about the same thing in this matter seems to  suggest  a\r\n\r\nplanned  salvo  against Singapore.  While such a wayang  may  be\r\n\r\nuseful for a certain party to regain its lost ground, it is most\r\n\r\nunkind  that  in the same breath it tries to undermine  that  of\r\n\r\nanother.   It is strange and absurd to me, Sir, that while  some\r\n\r\nMalaysian  leaders  are  angry against a  certain  newspaper  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  namely,  the  Business Times,  and  accusing  it  of\r\n\r\ninterfering in Malaysian domestic affairs, the media in Malaysia\r\n\r\nhave  almost  simultaneously  and blatantly  interfered  in  the\r\n\r\ninternal affairs of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have our heritage and we have every right to\r\n\r\npreserve it.  And just as the various communities in Malaysia, I\r\n\r\nam  sure, can look after themselves, we can look after ourselves\r\n\r\nand  protect our interest.  Outsiders should not interfere.  And\r\n\r\nworse still, Sir, if they employ misleading reports to create an\r\n\r\nair  of  distrust and suspicion of the Malays here  towards  our\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I know, following our separation from Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthere  was tacit agreement that we do not try to influence  each\r\n\r\nother's  domestic ground.  And for that reason,  our  respective\r\n\r\nnewspapers do not circulate in each other's country.  It may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  say  that  greater  care  should  be  applied  to\r\n\r\ntelevision which can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntranscend  borders.   It  is  also a  more  powerful  medium  in\r\n\r\ninfluencing and affecting the emotions of its viewers.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  the  recent  TV3 programme is a gross interference  in  our\r\n\r\ndomestic affairs.  I thought the tacit agreement between the two\r\n\r\ncountries  in 1965 was a sensible one and should be  adhered  to\r\n\r\nclosely,  especially  as  it concerns matters  of  race  in  two\r\n\r\nclosely  linked independent states.  I hope that  the  media  in\r\n\r\nboth countries will bear this in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the Sultan Hussain (Amendment) Bill.  I also  share\r\n\r\nthe sentiments and views of my hon. colleagues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, the Malaysian media, especially TV3,\r\n\r\nhave  chosen  to  join in this debate.  TV3  is  a  private  and\r\n\r\npolitically  connected television station in Malaysia.   In  its\r\n\r\nMalay broadcast, which my colleagues have mentioned in Viewpoint\r\n\r\non  30th June 1999, the programme and the presenter deliberately\r\n\r\nand  selectively slanted the report on this issue.  It has  gone\r\n\r\nto  the  extent of accusing the Singapore Government  of  taking\r\n\r\naway  Malay  rights.   The interview of Mr  Ridzwan  Dzafir  was\r\n\r\nedited  to  fit in with their slant reporting.  Facts  which  Mr\r\n\r\nRidzwan Dzafir took great pains to state in the full transcript,\r\n\r\nwhich I read, were ignored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, had this been a Singapore media report on Malaysia, it\r\n\r\nwould  have  caused no less than an uproar.  When  the  Business\r\n\r\nTimes  penned an editorial on 18th June 1999 on the  subject  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian election and its leadership, the event  caused  a\r\n\r\nstorm.   Malaysia's  Foreign Minister,  Syed  Hamid  Albar,  was\r\n\r\nreported  to  have  told Asiaweek that \"it is appalling  that  a\r\n\r\npaper  from a friendly country should take upon itself to meddle\r\n\r\nin our internal politics.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the TV3 broadcast is not more than meddling in our\r\n\r\ninternal  affairs, then what is?  We do not tell the  Malaysians\r\n\r\nhow to run their country.  They should do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlikewise.  Unfortunately, Malaysian politicians and their  media\r\n\r\nindulge  in  double  standards.  They act  as  if  they  have  a\r\n\r\nmonopoly  and  a  right  to criticise and  make  comments  about\r\n\r\nSingapore as it suits them.  Just this very morning, there is  a\r\n\r\nreport  in  the Straits Times and the headline reads  \"Singapore\r\n\r\nrapped  for  looking  down  on  Malaysia\".   The  commentary  in\r\n\r\nSunday's  Mingguan Malaysia by the former Chief  Editor  of  the\r\n\r\nUtusan  Malaysian  group  criticised the  so-called  media,  our\r\n\r\nmedia, of course, and SM's negative views on Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the short response is that this is sheer paranoia.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing further from the truth.  It is in Singapore's\r\n\r\ninterest to see a prosperous Malaysia, and we have stated in  no\r\n\r\nuncertain terms and on many occasions that we believe and act no\r\n\r\nless  on the \"prosper thy neighbour\" philosophy.  Nothing  hurts\r\n\r\nSingapore  socially  and  economically  more  than  a   troubled\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  When Malaysia sneezes, Singapore catches the flu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implying that Singaporeans can be easily manipulated by\r\n\r\nwestern  powers,  the commentary goes on to play  the  \"foreign\"\r\n\r\ncard,  which  is  very  popularly used in Malaysia  these  days,\r\n\r\nespecially in the last two years.  To say that the west is  more\r\n\r\ncomfortable  with  SM Lee and not so with the  \"anti-western  Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir\" is in my view laughable.  Everyone knows that  SM  Lee\r\n\r\nhas  more  than his share of detractors in the west and  in  the\r\n\r\nwestern media with the likes of William Safire.  It is only SM's\r\n\r\nintellect that has earned him and Singapore grudging respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, negative reports on Singapore in the Malaysian media\r\n\r\nare  often  received with stoic silence in Singapore.  Singapore\r\n\r\nleaders and Singaporeans who are riled often take it quietly  in\r\n\r\nour  stride.  We cannot choose our neighbours, but we can choose\r\n\r\nthe  way  we respond to intimidation and bullying tactics.   But\r\n\r\nthe report on TV3 on the Sultan Hussain (Amendment) Bill takes a\r\n\r\ndangerous  and  provocative line, and this has to  be  debunked.\r\n\r\nThis my colleagues have done so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's response to the Business Times' editorial,\r\n\r\nwhich  I mentioned earlier, is a criticism of the Business Times\r\n\r\nby our Prime Minister.  Will a Malaysian leader do likewise with\r\n\r\nthe TV3 report?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  like my colleagues, I wish to seek clarification from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in  regard to the legal status of the land  at  Istana\r\n\r\nKampong  Glam.   Just  now,  in his  speech,  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nconfirmed that it is State land since 1897.  The question is: if\r\n\r\nit  is  State  land, why is it that the Government is  providing\r\n\r\nannual  payments  of  monies to the beneficiaries  of  the  late\r\n\r\nSultan  Hussain?   Are there avenues for these beneficiaries  to\r\n\r\nclaim  that  the land belongs to them and not to the Government?\r\n\r\nAre there any attempts by them, through legal channels, to stake\r\n\r\ntheir claims?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask all these questions because there have been some\r\n\r\nstatements  made  by  some beneficiaries,  as  reported  in  the\r\n\r\nforeign media, that the land still belongs to them and that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government suddenly confiscated Istana  Kampong  Glam\r\n\r\nand chased out about 300 residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I wish to ask the Government's stand with regard\r\n\r\nto the distorted reports from the foreign media, as mentioned by\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues  just  now.   There have  been  many  mischievous\r\n\r\nreports from the foreign media accusing the Government of trying\r\n\r\nto erase the last symbol of the Malay Sultanate in Singapore and\r\n\r\nalso  to  erase  the history of the Malays in  Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nstatement  is  very mischievous.  My question is:  what  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  going  to  do  to correct  this  distorted  picture?\r\n\r\nPersonally,  I  strongly  object to the  interference  from  the\r\n\r\nforeign  media  with  regard  to our local  matters,  especially\r\n\r\npertaining to the Malays in Singapore.  The examples given by Mr\r\n\r\nYatiman  in his speech is a clear move by some foreign media  to\r\n\r\nmeddle in our internal affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I wish to ask the Minister about the progress\r\n\r\non  the  resettlement process of the tenants of  Istana  Kampong\r\n\r\nGlam.   Are  the  Government agencies giving them assistance  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate their move to their new homes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very generous offer by the Government to the 79\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  of  the late Sultan Hussain is much  appreciated.\r\n\r\nApart  from  receiving  monetary  payments,  tenants  of  Istana\r\n\r\nKampong  Glam who are eligible would be getting their own  flats\r\n\r\nand be able to live in a better environment as compared to their\r\n\r\nliving  environment  now.   But above all,  the  most  important\r\n\r\naspect  is the noble intention of the Government to establish  a\r\n\r\nMalay  Heritage  Centre at Istana Kampong Glam.   This  Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre will portray the Malay culture, arts, history, traditions\r\n\r\nand everything that is related to the Malays in Singapore.  I am\r\n\r\nsure   the  future  generation  will  be  able  to  gather  more\r\n\r\ninformation  with  regard  to the Malays,  including  the  Malay\r\n\r\nSultanate, before the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malays are proud of the history of the Malay\r\n\r\nSultanate  in Singapore.  However, that era is now part  of  our\r\n\r\nhistory.  The Malays now look towards the future with confidence\r\n\r\nin  a meritocratic Singapore.  While some hearts still hold  for\r\n\r\nthe  golden past, the Malays are now more realistic and want  to\r\n\r\nmove along with the mainstream to face the challenges of the new\r\n\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill as it will benefit not only the\r\n\r\nMalays but, most importantly, all races in Singapore because the\r\n\r\nMalay Heritage Centre shall be a part of the heritage of a multi-racial Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the\r\n\r\nMembers  who have spoken - Mr Yatiman Yusof, Mr Harun Ghani,  Mr\r\n\r\nLoh  Meng See, Mr Zulkifli Baharudin, Mr Mohamad Maidin, Mr Chng\r\n\r\nHee  Kok  and Encik Ibrahim Othman.  Let me touch on the  points\r\n\r\nthat they have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the matter of clarifying the legal aspects which\r\n\r\nsome of my colleagues,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr  Yatiman  Yusof, Mr Mohamad Maidin and Encik Ibrahim  Othman,\r\n\r\nreferred  to.  I have already outlined the legal position  at  a\r\n\r\nprevious  sitting  but in response to the  questions  raised  by\r\n\r\nMembers, let me reiterate that the legal position is very clear.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  former  Minister for  National  Development,  Mr\r\n\r\nDhanabalan, said in this House on 15th April 1989, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In 1896 towards the end of the last century, there was a\r\n\r\ndispute  among the family of Sultan Hussain as to  who  was  the\r\n\r\nsuccessor  to the Sultanate and to the estate, ie,  the  Kampong\r\n\r\nGlam  Estate.   This matter went to court and in December  1897,\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Appeal ruled that there was no one who could claim\r\n\r\nto  be  successor.  The estate therefore reverted to the  Crown.\r\n\r\nIt  became  State  Land  and it was no  longer  subject  to  the\r\n\r\ntreaties which previously affected it.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>Since  then,  Sir, that is for more than 100 years, the  Kampong\r\n\r\nGlam  Estate, including the former Istana, has been State  Land.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this legal position has been made very clear in the\r\n\r\nSultan  Hussain  Ordinance, which  was  enacted  in  1904.   The\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  Sir, (and I am referring to the main Ordinance,  not\r\n\r\nto  the  amendment Bill) has several provisions which  reiterate\r\n\r\nthis  position.  For example, section 2, and I quote, \"The  said\r\n\r\nland  situate in Kampong Glam having reverted to the Crown shall\r\n\r\nbe  administered by the Collector of Land Revenue  in  the  same\r\n\r\nmanner as other Crown lands.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  section 4 reads, \"If the said lands in Kampong  Glam  which\r\n\r\nare hereby declared to have reverted to the Crown as decided  by\r\n\r\nthe Court of Appeal of the Colony.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal position is very clear that these have been and\r\n\r\nare  State lands.  In answer to the specific questions by  Encik\r\n\r\nIbrahim  Othman  on why we have the annual payment,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nstated  in  my  main  speech today as well as  in  the  previous\r\n\r\nsitting, it was especially provided for in the Ordinance  as  an\r\n\r\nobligation of the Government to pay.  But as I also said in this\r\n\r\nHouse  the rationale was to take care of the then family of  the\r\n\r\nlate  Sultan Hussain who was described by the Government at that\r\n\r\ntime  as  being  financially  improvident.   So,  that  was  the\r\n\r\nbackground to that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked by some who spoke about the progress on\r\n\r\nresettlement  of  occupants.   I  would  say,  Sir,   that   the\r\n\r\nresettlement  exercise  is proceeding  well.   Of  course,  this\r\n\r\nprocess  takes time because the Land Office has to identify  and\r\n\r\nascertain  who  were  the occupants and  who  are  eligible  for\r\n\r\nresettlement benefits.  For example, I was told that a  few  who\r\n\r\nwere staying there were foreign workers.  Some are eligible  for\r\n\r\ncertain  kinds  of  benefits and some are  eligible  for  lesser\r\n\r\nbenefits.  Some were occupants of HDB flats or were actually  in\r\n\r\nownership   of   HDB   flats.   Under  the  normal   rules   for\r\n\r\nresettlement, we have to assess their different eligibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the resettlement payments and benefits will\r\n\r\nenable  them  to  pay  the downpayment  for  HDB  flats,  in  my\r\n\r\ndiscussion with my officials, I was assured that those who would\r\n\r\nqualify for HDB flats would have the ability to pay for whatever\r\n\r\ninitial payments for the HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the progress of the resettlement exercise, as of\r\n\r\ntoday,  the Land Office has processed the majority of cases  and\r\n\r\nalmost three-quarters, some 122 out of the 170 individuals, have\r\n\r\nalready accepted the resettlement package and have moved out  or\r\n\r\nare in the process of moving out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked about the cost and expenses to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe  final  cost of the annual improved payments  will  actually\r\n\r\ndepend  on how many finally opt for annual payment and how  many\r\n\r\nopt  for the lump sum payments.  Taking into account the  number\r\n\r\nof  people  who have opted for lump sum payment, the new  scheme\r\n\r\nmay  cost  the Government close to $6 million at today's  value.\r\n\r\nBut  the Government also incurs cost as regards the resettlement\r\n\r\nbenefits  but  I am unable now, in this House, to state  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  the cost will be as the exercise is still in progress  and\r\n\r\nindividual  claims are not identical.  But we expect  it  to  be\r\n\r\naround $1.5 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin made some comments about the Malay\r\n\r\nHeritage Centre which will be taken into account, I am sure,  by\r\n\r\nboth MITA as well as the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMalay Heritage Foundation.  He made some specific points on  the\r\n\r\nneed for involving other descendants, the need for being open to\r\n\r\ncooperation  from different quarters and different  sources.   I\r\n\r\nhave  had  a  discussion with Mr Ridzwan Dzafir and  from  these\r\n\r\ndiscussions I have a clear impression that he is a man receptive\r\n\r\nto  ideas and suggestions from all quarters and I have no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat,  with  that kind of willingness, he will  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider cooperation and ideas from all sources, whether  within\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  outside,  as to how to make  the  Malay  Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre a truly, lively and effective heritage centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the other main points raised by colleagues\r\n\r\nconcerning  the comments, false reports, distorted  reports  and\r\n\r\neven  mischievous reports which have appeared in  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nmedia,  including the more recent TV3 programme.  Let me recount\r\n\r\nsome of these false allegations and distortions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it had been erroneously reported that the Istana\r\n\r\nbuilding  will  be demolished.  This is of course  untrue.   Not\r\n\r\nonly  it  is  not  to be demolished, but the  building  will  be\r\n\r\nconserved  and  used for purposes of the Malay Heritage  Centre.\r\n\r\nThis has been made clear right from the beginning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it was erroneously reported that the\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  would  receive a total of  only  $350,000.   This\r\n\r\nagain  is  not true.  The truth is that they would get  $350,000\r\n\r\nper annum over 30 years, if it is on an annual payment scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, some reports also stated the Government had\r\n\r\n\"suddenly seized the land and evicted the 300 residents\".  As Mr\r\n\r\nYatiman Yusof pointed out, it is not 300, but 170.  But the main\r\n\r\nsting  of  this  mischief is that we suddenly seized  the  land.\r\n\r\nThis  is also untrue.  The Government had, on several occasions,\r\n\r\nas  far  back as 1993, announced in this House, the Government's\r\n\r\nplan  to  develop the Istana Kampong Glam into a Malay  Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre.  In May 1993, the then Minister for Information and  the\r\n\r\nArts,  my colleague, BG George Yeo, informed the House  that  Mr\r\n\r\nRidzwan Dzafir was chairing a working\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngroup to look into this project.  So, it is untrue to say it was\r\n\r\n\"sudden\".  Furthermore, no one has been suddenly evicted because\r\n\r\nnormal   resettlement  procedures  have  been  followed,  giving\r\n\r\neveryone  ample  time to make arrangements.   Also,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned, the Kampong Glam Estate has been State land for  more\r\n\r\nthan  100  years. The question of the Government  \"seizing\"  the\r\n\r\nland therefore does not arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke about the resettlement exercise. Some of these\r\n\r\nMalaysian  media  reports  had distorted  the  facts  about  the\r\n\r\nresettlement scheme and gave the impression that they were being\r\n\r\nevicted without any resettlement benefit.  Mr Harun Ghani  asked\r\n\r\nme  about this.  Sir, the truth is that the occupants have  been\r\n\r\noffered   attractive   resettlement   benefits   which   include\r\n\r\nalternative   HDB  housing,  removal  allowances,  payment   for\r\n\r\nindividual  structures in the vicinity of the Istana from  which\r\n\r\nthey  are  vacating  and  also ex-gratia  payments.   The  media\r\n\r\nreports  in  Malaysia have also conveniently ignored or  omitted\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that the project was to establish the Malay  Heritage\r\n\r\nCentre which would benefit not only the Malay community but also\r\n\r\npreserve Singapore's multi-cultural heritage.  Several  MPs,  Mr\r\n\r\nZulkifli,  Mr  Loh  Meng  See and others,  have  emphasised  the\r\n\r\nimportant point that this is not an issue of just preserving the\r\n\r\nMalay  heritage, but the heritage centre is a project  which  is\r\n\r\ngoing to benefit the entire Singapore community.  It is a symbol\r\n\r\nof our shared heritage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also referred to the recent TV3 programme\r\n\r\nwhich   is  a  good  example  of  suppression  of  facts.    TV3\r\n\r\ninterviewed  Mr  Ridzwan Dzafir, Chairman of the Malay  Heritage\r\n\r\nFoundation.  However, it suppressed the important points made by\r\n\r\nMr  Ridzwan.  For  example,  Mr Ridzwan  had  said,  \"the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity greatly welcomes the Malay Heritage Centre.\" This  was\r\n\r\nnot carried by TV3.  He also said, \"Regarding the land or Istana\r\n\r\nKampong  Glam  and the Bendadara House, they have  become  State\r\n\r\nland for almost 100 years so it is not a problem\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor the Government here.\".  This was also not carried.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV3 had also mischievously portrayed the development of the\r\n\r\nMalay  Heritage  Centre  \"as  an excuse  to  acquire  the  Malay\r\n\r\nsultanate land\", deny Malay rights and \"erase the history of the\r\n\r\nMalays\".  How can the intention be to erase the history  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays when so much efforts and so much money have been expended\r\n\r\nby  the  Government to preserve and project the heritage of  the\r\n\r\nMalays, which is part and parcel of the Singapore heritage?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore share the views of Members that such\r\n\r\nirresponsible   and   mischievous  media   reports   amount   to\r\n\r\ninterference in our internal affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These media reports have deliberately distorted and played\r\n\r\nup  the  facts  of  a sensitive racial internal  issue,  without\r\n\r\nregard  to the possible damage to the racial harmony and  social\r\n\r\nstability  in Singapore.  They could have easily worked  up  our\r\n\r\nMalay   ground,  caused  ill  feelings  between  the   different\r\n\r\ncommunities  and soured race relations.  Fortunately,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nfacts were well publicised and known to all Singaporeans so that\r\n\r\nthese  slanted  reports  failed  to  provoke  a  response   from\r\n\r\nSingaporeans or to damage our racial harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently Malaysian media and others had accused the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business  Times  (BT) of  interfering  in  Malaysia's\r\n\r\ninternal affairs by commenting on political developments  there.\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister Goh Chok Tong's Press Secretary wrote to the  BT\r\n\r\nto  put  on  record  the  Government's  disapproval  of  the  BT\r\n\r\neditorial  in  question.  As the Members who  have  spoken  have\r\n\r\npointed out, non-interference cannot be a one-sided matter.  The\r\n\r\nMalaysian  media  should  not practise  double  standards.  They\r\n\r\nshould  heed  their own advice and refrain from  interfering  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's internal affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Prof. S Jayakumar].\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

As trade\r\n\r\nand  capital  flows  become increasingly  international  and  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  expands  its  role as a financial  centre,  there  is\r\n\r\nincreased  scope  not  only  for cross-border  crimes  but  also\r\n\r\ninternational money laundering to occur here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, further amendments to the DTA are necessary to\r\n\r\nenable  us to deter and combat money laundering more effectively\r\n\r\nas well as to deprive criminals of the enjoyment of the benefits\r\n\r\nof   their  crime.   The  amended  legislation  will  give   our\r\n\r\nenforcement agencies and financial regulators sharper  tools  in\r\n\r\ntheir  work to help maintain Singapore's reputation as  a  well-regulated financial centre and a city largely free of crime.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Serious Crimes  -  Money Laundering</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DTA was enacted to criminalise the laundering of\r\n\r\nbenefits derived from drug trafficking, as well as to allow  for\r\n\r\nthe  investigation and the confiscation of such benefits.  Money\r\n\r\nlaundering,  as  is commonly known, consists of  concealing  the\r\n\r\norigin  of  moneys derived from illicit activities  and  passing\r\n\r\nthem off as the legitimate proceeds of lawful activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen   the   DTA  was  enacted,  drug  trafficking  was   viewed\r\n\r\ninternationally,  and  in Singapore, as the  primary  source  of\r\n\r\nfunds for money laundering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since then, there has been overwhelming evidence\r\n\r\nthat  transnational crime, which is a growing  problem  for  the\r\n\r\nworld community, is not restricted to drugs or proceeds of  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking.  Criminal organisations are multi-faceted and other\r\n\r\nserious  offences constitute an important and growing source  of\r\n\r\nillegal wealth entering legitimate financial channels.  This has\r\n\r\nled to an international trend of criminalising the laundering of\r\n\r\nnot  only  drug  money but also the proceeds  of  other  serious\r\n\r\ncrimes as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), or an\r\n\r\ninter-Governmental  body formed in 1989 by  the  G-7  to  combat\r\n\r\nmoney  laundering  globally,  started  first  by  requiring  its\r\n\r\nmembers to take measures to combat drug money laundering.   Then\r\n\r\nin June 1996, it required its members to extend money laundering\r\n\r\npredicate  offences to beyond drug trafficking.   All  Financial\r\n\r\nAction  Task  Force members, which include most of  the  Western\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries  and Hong Kong among others,  have  already\r\n\r\nextended  or  taken measures to extend the scope of their  anti-money  laundering  regime  to include the  proceeds  of  serious\r\n\r\ncrimes.    Singapore,  which joined the  Financial  Action  Task\r\n\r\nForce  in 1991, should do likewise, to demonstrate that  we  are\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  being  a  responsible  partner  in  international\r\n\r\ninitiatives to combat crime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from international trends, it is also important for\r\n\r\nour  local enforcement efforts to target the proceeds of a  wide\r\n\r\nrange of serious crimes.   Firstly, drug trafficking is not  the\r\n\r\nonly  crime  that  results  in significant  amounts  of  illegal\r\n\r\nproceeds.   Crimes, such as fraud and criminal breach of  trust,\r\n\r\ndo  too.  We do not want criminals or their families to be  able\r\n\r\nto  enjoy  the fruits of such crimes.  Secondly, our enforcement\r\n\r\nefforts against money laundering have sometimes been hindered at\r\n\r\nthe  investigation stage.  For example, to obtain  an  order  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate into the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccounts  of  a  suspect, the authorities have  to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the  courts  that, among others, there  are  reasonable\r\n\r\ngrounds for suspecting that the suspect has carried out  or  has\r\n\r\nbenefited from drug trafficking.  This may be difficult to do as\r\n\r\ncriminals,  nowadays, can be involved in several  crimes,  where\r\n\r\nthe proceeds are mixed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, this Bill seeks to amend the DTA to extend the asset\r\n\r\nconfiscation  and anti-money laundering provisions  of  the  DTA\r\n\r\nbeyond drug trafficking to cover other serious crimes.   To give\r\n\r\neffect  to  this, clauses 23 and 25 of the Bill seek to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  money  laundering offences arising  from  benefits  of\r\n\r\nserious  offences.   These  include the conspiracy,  incitement,\r\n\r\nattempt  and abetment of these offences.  Clause 30 of the  Bill\r\n\r\ninserts  a  Second Schedule to the DTA to specify  the  list  of\r\n\r\nserious  crimes  to be included in the Act.  The  list  includes\r\n\r\ncrimes  that  are serious in nature but excludes serious  crimes\r\n\r\nthat  cannot be linked to money laundering (for example,  bigamy\r\n\r\nand  incest).  Many of the amendments in the Bill merely  extend\r\n\r\ncurrent provisions covering drug trafficking proceeds to serious\r\n\r\ncrimes  proceeds.  For example, clause 7 of the Bill  inserts  a\r\n\r\nnew section 4A.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In extending our measures to deal with serious crimes, we\r\n\r\nare  mindful  that  the  Bill should not  adversely  affect  the\r\n\r\noperations  of the financial institutions in Singapore.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill provides similar safeguards, found in the existing DTA\r\n\r\nfor  investigations into drug offences, to prevent third parties\r\n\r\nfrom  being able to pry into a person's financial accounts under\r\n\r\nfrivolous  pretext  or  under the guise of  investigations  into\r\n\r\nserious  offences.  These can be found in the new sections  26A,\r\n\r\n26B  and  34 and the amendments to section 31.  In the  case  of\r\n\r\nforeign  requests  for  financial  information,  some   of   the\r\n\r\nsafeguards  include the need for the existence  of  a  bilateral\r\n\r\nagreement  or  treaty with the requesting country,  the  offence\r\n\r\nbeing  a  crime in both countries and the assistance  not  being\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  public interest.  The amended legislation  is  not\r\n\r\nmore liberal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan  those  of other financial centres in releasing information\r\n\r\nto foreign enforcement agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also introduces various amendments to fine-tune the provisions of the DTA to make it a more effective tool\r\n\r\nto  combat money laundering and deprive criminals of their  ill-gotten gains. Let me explain the more important ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clauses 22 to 25 amend the money laundering\r\n\r\noffences to clarify that the prosecution need not prove that the\r\n\r\naccused  had  actual knowledge of the relevant facts,  that  is,\r\n\r\nthat  the person is a drug trafficker, or that his proceeds  are\r\n\r\nderived from drug trafficking or other serious crimes.  Instead,\r\n\r\nthe  accused can be convicted based on evidence showing that  he\r\n\r\nhad  \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that the person  trafficked\r\n\r\nin  drugs or the proceeds were derived from drug trafficking  or\r\n\r\nother   serious  crimes.    This  would  facilitate  enforcement\r\n\r\nbecause  in practice, proof of actual knowledge is difficult  to\r\n\r\nproduce. This is in line with the laws of many countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also increasing the penalties for money laundering\r\n\r\nfrom  seven years jail and/or $100,000 fine to seven years  jail\r\n\r\nand/or  $200,000.   As  money laundering is  primarily  a  crime\r\n\r\ninvolving  large  amounts  of  money,  the  current  maximum  of\r\n\r\n$100,000 should be increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 20 inserts a new section to make the\r\n\r\nreporting of suspicious transactions mandatory for all  persons,\r\n\r\nincluding financial institutions and non-financial institutions.\r\n\r\nThis  means that a person who, in the course of his professional\r\n\r\nduties,  comes  to know or suspect that any property  represents\r\n\r\nthe proceeds of drug trafficking or serious crimes is obliged to\r\n\r\ndisclose  the  knowledge or suspicion to the  authorities.   The\r\n\r\nmaximum  penalty  for non-disclosure is a  $10,000  fine.   Some\r\n\r\npermissible exceptions are mentioned in the new section.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspicious transactions reporting is already mandatory for\r\n\r\nbanks under current MAS Guidelines which have the force of  law.\r\n\r\nThis new section extends the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nobligation  to  non-financial institutions and  centralises  the\r\n\r\nprovisions in the DTA.  Many countries, especially those in  the\r\n\r\nFATF,  have  already  enacted similar  provisions  as  there  is\r\n\r\nworldwide   recognition   that  the  reporting   of   suspicious\r\n\r\ntransactions is a key source of intelligence for law enforcement\r\n\r\nauthorities tackling money laundering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the new sections 26B and 34 lower the standard\r\n\r\nrequired  for foreign offences in respect of applying for  court\r\n\r\nwarrants   or  orders  to  obtain  information  from   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions from \"prima facie case\" to \"reasonable grounds  for\r\n\r\nsuspecting\".   As I have mentioned, money laundering is often an\r\n\r\ninternational  crime  and  hence  international  cooperation  is\r\n\r\nvital.   However,  in  our experience of  forging  international\r\n\r\ncooperation  with foreign countries, \"prima facie case\"  is  too\r\n\r\nhigh  a  hurdle  to meet in order to assist other  countries  in\r\n\r\ntheir  investigations. \"Reasonable grounds  for  suspecting\"  is\r\n\r\nalso the test in many countries.  Hence it is necessary to lower\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, clause 25 inserts a new section 43B to make it an\r\n\r\noffence for a person who has reasonable grounds to suspect  that\r\n\r\na  money  laundering  investigation is  being  or  about  to  be\r\n\r\nconducted  to tip-off another person with information  which  is\r\n\r\nlikely to prejudice the investigation.  Since the new offence of\r\n\r\ntipping off is merely an extension of the offence of prejudicing\r\n\r\ninvestigation, the penalty for this will be the same as that for\r\n\r\nprejudicing  investigations under section 44, ie, a  maximum  of\r\n\r\nthree years imprisonment and/or a $30,000 fine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, as drug money laundering offences are already\r\n\r\nextraditable, clause 31(3) similarly amends the Extradition  Act\r\n\r\nto make serious crimes money-laundering offences extraditable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also provides for repealing the\r\n\r\nCorruption (Confiscation of Benefits) Act in clause 31(2).  This\r\n\r\nis  because  the amended DTA would apply to corruption  offences\r\n\r\nand  would  have a scope wider than the Corruption (Confiscation\r\n\r\nof Benefits) Act as it also includes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovisions   relating   to  foreign  corruption   offences   and\r\n\r\ncriminalises  the money laundering of corruption  proceeds.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the Bill provides for the amended Act to  be  renamed\r\n\r\nthe  \"Corruption,  Drug  Trafficking and  other  Serious  Crimes\r\n\r\n(Confiscation of Benefits) Act\" to reflect its wider scope.  The\r\n\r\nword \"Corruption\" is placed in the title as we want to send  the\r\n\r\nsignal  that  corruption will continue to be tackled  even  more\r\n\r\nseriously  in  Singapore  after the  repeal  of  the  Corruption\r\n\r\n(Confiscation of Benefits) Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, the new laws, by confiscating the illegal\r\n\r\nproceeds  of  serious  crimes  and  preventing  criminals   from\r\n\r\nenjoying  the fruits of their crimes, would render  many  crimes\r\n\r\nunprofitable  ventures.   These will be  additional  weapons  to\r\n\r\nfight  against  crime in Singapore.  In addition,  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendments  would also allow my Ministry to keep  ahead  of  the\r\n\r\never-changing  transnational crime and global  money  laundering\r\n\r\nsituation.  In particular, although Singapore is one of the  key\r\n\r\nfinancial  centres  in  the world - it is  open,  efficient  and\r\n\r\nsophisticated  -  we  also  want  to  ensure  that  she  is  not\r\n\r\nsusceptible  to  money  laundering.  These  proposed  amendments\r\n\r\nwould  in  fact enhance Singapore's growth and reputation  as  a\r\n\r\nmodern international financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion and the remaining items on the Order Paper for  today\r\n\r\nbe  exempted  at  this  day's sitting  from  the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DRUG TRAFFICKING (CONFISCATION OF BENEFITS)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A.

Singapore has come a long way  to\r\n\r\nbe  what  it  is  today and it is vital that we  equip  our  law\r\n\r\nenforcement agencies with a more effective legislation to combat\r\n\r\ncorrupt practices and other serious crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that with the amendment Bill there will be a\r\n\r\npositive effect on the political, social and economic aspects of\r\n\r\nour  country.   Those who have the intention of committing  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking, corrupt practices and other serious crimes  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  the interest of Singapore will have to think  twice\r\n\r\nbefore  committing  such crimes.  With the amendment  Bill,  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authorities  will have the powers  to  confiscate  the\r\n\r\nproceeds  acquired  by  the  criminals  through  their  criminal\r\n\r\nactivities and hit them hard in their pockets.  This  will  also\r\n\r\ndeter others from committing such offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation\r\n\r\nof Benefits) (Amendment) Bill on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It is hard on the criminals and deters others from\r\n\r\ncommitting such crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It helps to maintain low crime rate and enhance the\r\n\r\nconfidence of foreign investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) It helps to maintain political, social and economic\r\n\r\nstability  of our country. In doing so, it could help to  create\r\n\r\nmore employment opportunities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) It helps to achieve our vision in making Singapore a\r\n\r\nsafe and best home for everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment Bill not only benefits both Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  foreign investors alike, it also enhances Singapore's image\r\n\r\nat  the  international level. I believe that this  amendment  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   if  we  were  to  see  stability  in  our   country.\r\n\r\nEvidently, it is vital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  the  amendment  to the Drug Trafficking  (Confiscation  of\r\n\r\nBenefits) Act be amended to include corrupt practices and  other\r\n\r\nserious crimes for the interest of our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for giving me this opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has given the background why this\r\n\r\nlegislation is necessary.  I am generally in support of most  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions.  I have some reservation on some of the clauses\r\n\r\nwhich I will come to later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me address the basic philosophy why we need to\r\n\r\nhave this legislation.  We had for a long time in the early  70s\r\n\r\ntaken  seriously the question of drug and drug trafficking.   It\r\n\r\nis important that our legislation takes care of drug trafficking\r\n\r\nand  money  laundering.   In  many  parts  of  the  world,  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking  is  becoming an acute problem.   We  need  to  have\r\n\r\nlegislation that will take care of this, and I am glad that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has taken the step.  I am a little unhappy that under\r\n\r\nnew  section 43 the fine is only $30,000.  $30,000 is  a  paltry\r\n\r\nsum  for  traffickers and those who are helping the traffickers.\r\n\r\nI hope that this will be reviewed in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also concerned with clause 22. As a lawyer,\r\n\r\nknowledge  is  a  very important factor in a crime.   But  I  am\r\n\r\nprepared  in  this  instance to support the  proposed  amendment\r\n\r\nbecause we have to seek from actual knowledge to one where there\r\n\r\nis a reasonable ground to believe, and I think the court will no\r\n\r\ndoubt  take  a great deal of pain to see that this is  observed.\r\n\r\nInitially,  I  have my doubt whether this piece  of  legislation\r\n\r\nshould be worded this way.  But after carefully considering  the\r\n\r\nfact, I am prepared to support the provisions in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, initially I have also reservation on increasing the\r\n\r\npenalty  from $100,000 to $200,000.  But I support again because\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is  timely to increase the fine from  $100,000  to\r\n\r\n$200,000.  In fact, I would have been happier if it was  higher,\r\n\r\nbut let us go stage by stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally, we have a balanced legislation here, and I\r\n\r\nhope that the whole House will join me in supporting the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the speakers for supporting\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.   I have explained why we have pegged the penalty  of\r\n\r\n$30,000  for those who were convicted of tipping off information\r\n\r\nto  the  people  concerned.   This is actually  consistent  with\r\n\r\nsection  44  of  the current DTA.  So we are not doing  anything\r\n\r\nnew.  Similarly, for the other provisions, it is also consistent\r\n\r\nwith  the  current  DTA, and we have from experience  no  reason\r\n\r\nright  now  to  increase that penalty.  And on  some  subsequent\r\n\r\noccasion if we need to do that, we will consider the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should have imposed \"actual knowledge\"\r\n\r\ninstead  of  \"reasonable ground to believe\",  the  latter  is  a\r\n\r\nstandard set in many other countries, and I do not believe  that\r\n\r\nwe  should be more stringent than the other countries.  Since we\r\n\r\nare  part of the international community in this area, we should\r\n\r\ntherefore  be in line with what the other countries  are  doing.\r\n\r\nWe  are  not doing more; we are not doing less than what  others\r\n\r\nare  doing.  We are in keeping with the international  mood  and\r\n\r\nclimate and the trend as required of the other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DENTISTS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to provide for the registration of dentists\r\n\r\nand  for matters connected therewith, and to repeal the Dentists\r\n\r\nAct  (Chapter 76 of the 1985 Revised Edition).  It will  enhance\r\n\r\nthe role of the Dental Council so that it can perform\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nits  functions  more  effectively and  raise  the  standards  of\r\n\r\nprofessional conduct and practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore enjoys a high standard of dental care. Today\r\n\r\nthere  are  almost 1,000 graduate dentists and  67  Division  II\r\n\r\ndentists.   And  amongst  our graduate  dentists,  more  than  a\r\n\r\nquarter have postgraduate qualifications, providing a wide range\r\n\r\nof specialist dental care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain this high standard of dental care, we need to\r\n\r\nensure   that  dental  students  are  trained  effectively   and\r\n\r\nregistered practitioners are kept abreast of advances in  dental\r\n\r\nsciences to meet the needs and expectations of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the major new provisions that are\r\n\r\nbeing introduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Dental Council</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Act provides for a Dental Board of eight\r\n\r\nappointed  members  and two ex-officio  members.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nprovision  for the election of members to the Dental Board.   To\r\n\r\nbring  it  in line with the corporate governance of the  medical\r\n\r\nand  other  professions,  the Bill proposes  a  Council  of  six\r\n\r\nappointed and five elected members.  The appointed members  will\r\n\r\nrepresent  the cross-section of dentists, with one  member  from\r\n\r\nthe  academia, one member from the non-graduate dentists and the\r\n\r\nrest  from the public and private sectors.  The election of five\r\n\r\ncouncil  members  will provide the mechanism for representatives\r\n\r\nto be elected by their peers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current Act, the Director of Dental Service is\r\n\r\ndesignated  as  the President of the Dental Board.   In  future,\r\n\r\nmembers of the Council shall themselves elect one of its members\r\n\r\nto  be  the  President.   This will  give  the  Council  greater\r\n\r\nautonomy and self-regulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that Council members take their appointments\r\n\r\nseriously, clause 8 provides for the removal from office of  any\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  Council who is absent without leave  for  three\r\n\r\nconsecutive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nordinary meetings of the Council or its Committees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will make it compulsory to vote for the elected\r\n\r\nmembers  to  the Council.  This is similar to the provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe Medical Registration Act and the Legal Profession Act, which\r\n\r\nalso  provide  for compulsory voting of members to  the  Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil and the Law Society respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Functions of the Dental Council</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the current functions of registering\r\n\r\ndentists,  issuing  practising  licences,  and  regulating   the\r\n\r\nprofessional conduct of dentists, the Bill seeks to broaden  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the Dental Council.  Clause 4 enables  the  Dental\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  make recommendations to the appropriate authorities\r\n\r\non:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the content and nature of courses of instruction and\r\n\r\nexaminations leading to the dental degree at NUS; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the training and continuing education of registered\r\n\r\ndentists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to ensure that our dental students and practising\r\n\r\ndentists continue to receive appropriate training, and  to  keep\r\n\r\nabreast  of advances and developments in order to maintain  high\r\n\r\nprofessional standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Register of Dental Specialists</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increasing number of graduate dentists and the\r\n\r\ntrend  towards  specialisation,  there  is  a  need  for  us  to\r\n\r\nestablish a dental specialist register.  Clause 31 provides  for\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of a Dental Specialists Register through  the\r\n\r\npublication of Regulations to be made under this Act as and when\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Disciplinary Procedures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to disciplinary procedures. To\r\n\r\nexpedite  the  handling of complaints, and to  allow  for  wider\r\n\r\nrepresentation from dentists in general and from the lay public,\r\n\r\nthe Bill allows for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of Complaints Committees to include Dental  Council\r\n\r\nMembers,  other dentists and lay persons.  Presently, there  are\r\n\r\nno  provisions for lay persons in the disciplinary process.  The\r\n\r\nconcept of lay persons being involved in disciplinary procedures\r\n\r\nis in the Medical Registration Act, the Legal Profession Act and\r\n\r\nAccountants  Act.   It  makes  the  disciplinary  process   more\r\n\r\ntransparent and open.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, dentists are disciplined only if they are convicted\r\n\r\nof  any heinous offence, or are guilty of infamous conduct in  a\r\n\r\nprofessional  respect.  The proposed amendments will  allow  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  discipline dentists who have  been  guilty  of  any\r\n\r\nimproper   act  or  conduct  which  brings  disrepute   to   his\r\n\r\nprofession,  or who have been guilty of professional misconduct.\r\n\r\nThis is also in line with provisions in the Medical Registration\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a dentist is guilty of infamous conduct in a\r\n\r\nprofessional  respect,  the existing  Act  prescribes  only  one\r\n\r\npenalty, that of striking his name off the register.  This  does\r\n\r\nnot  allow for a graded penalty according to the severity of the\r\n\r\noffence.  The Bill addresses these shortcomings by enhancing the\r\n\r\npenalty  options available to the Dental Council.   It  empowers\r\n\r\nthe Council to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) remove the name of the dentist from the Dentists\r\n\r\nRegister;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) suspend the dentist from practice for a maximum period\r\n\r\nof three years;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) impose a fine of not more than $5,000; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) censure the dentist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council shall also be empowered to order the suspension\r\n\r\nor  removal of name to take effect immediately, instead of after\r\n\r\n30  days, if it is deemed necessary in the public interest or in\r\n\r\nthe best interest of the dental practitioner concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Restoration to the Register</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a dentist has his name removed from the Register\r\n\r\npursuant  to  a disciplinary inquiry, it does not mean  that  he\r\n\r\ncannot practise his profession anymore.  There is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovision  for the dentist to apply for his name to be  restored\r\n\r\nafter a minimum period of three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Health Committee</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a dentist who is unfit to practise because of\r\n\r\npsychiatric condition, drug or alcohol dependency or  any  other\r\n\r\nphysical  or  mental  condition,  cannot  be  removed  from  the\r\n\r\nRegister.   Clauses 48 and 49 provide for the setting  up  of  a\r\n\r\nHealth Committee to review any dentist whose fitness to practise\r\n\r\nis  impaired by reason of his physical or mental condition.   It\r\n\r\nwill be empowered to restrict or suspend the dentist's practice,\r\n\r\nor  recommend  that his name be removed from the Register.   The\r\n\r\nMedical  Registration Act and the Dentists  Act  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom also provide for the establishment of a Health Committee\r\n\r\nwith similar functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proposed increase in penalty for unauthorised persons acting  as dentists</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem, which we face from time to time, is the\r\n\r\nillegal conduct of dental procedures by unqualified persons, eg,\r\n\r\nthe  making  of  dentures.  Often these are done  improperly  or\r\n\r\nunder  non-hygienic conditions.  Clause 28 increases the maximum\r\n\r\npenalty for a first offender from the present $2,000 to $25,000.\r\n\r\nFor  subsequent  offences, the penalties will  be  increased  to\r\n\r\n$50,000  or  imprisonment of up to six months  or  both.   These\r\n\r\nenhanced  penalties very clearly signal that the  Government  is\r\n\r\ndetermined to stamp out such cases of illegal practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential and other minor amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes consequential changes as a result of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed amendments that I have just described,  and  other\r\n\r\nminor  amendments to delete obsolete terminology and  to  update\r\n\r\nthe existing provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have come a long way in the provision\r\n\r\nof dental care.  The general state of dental health in Singapore\r\n\r\nis good.  It is that way because we have well trained and highly\r\n\r\ncompetent dentists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges facing the dental profession and the entire\r\n\r\nhealthcare sector will be greater in the years ahead.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to see the development of new materials to treat dental\r\n\r\ndecay,  new techniques and new methods to replace missing teeth.\r\n\r\nThe  dental profession must ensure that its members are properly\r\n\r\nqualified  before they are allowed to use the new materials  and\r\n\r\ntechnology.   At  the  same time, we must  deter  dentists  from\r\n\r\nadvising   their  patients  to  undergo  unnecessary   high-tech\r\n\r\nprocedures for financial or other reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will help to achieve these objectives. It will\r\n\r\nenhance  the  role  of the Dental Council,  and  empower  it  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the high professional and ethical standards of  dental\r\n\r\npractice, and to uphold the integrity of the profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto speak in support of the Dentists Bill.  As it repeals and re-enacts,  with  amendments, the Dentists Act  of  1985  that  has\r\n\r\nbecome  outdated and inadequate in many areas, its  introduction\r\n\r\nis necessary and timely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are several details that merit concern and\r\n\r\ncomment,  I  feel  that the setting up of a  Dental  Council  to\r\n\r\nreplace  the  Dental  Board  is significant  and  very  welcome.\r\n\r\nUnlike  previously, the registered dentists will now have  their\r\n\r\nown representatives as spelt out in the amendments in clause  3,\r\n\r\nin   this   important   \"watchdog  body\"  of   the   profession.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the role of the Dental Board is not replaced by a 6-function  regulatory role of the Dental Council, as  defined  in\r\n\r\nclause  4.   All this should place the \"watchdog  body\"  of  the\r\n\r\ndental  profession in good stead in the eyes of both the  dental\r\n\r\npractitioners as well as the general public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to comment on other aspects of the\r\n\r\nDentists Bill as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4. This clause defines the functions of the Dental\r\n\r\nCouncil  and the function to determine and regulate the  conduct\r\n\r\nand  ethics of registered dentists is welcome indeed.  This will\r\n\r\nprovide  the  avenue  for patients to bring  complaints  against\r\n\r\ntheir  dentists.  Furthermore, this will establish  a  means  to\r\n\r\nprotect patients from unscrupulous or unethical dentists as well\r\n\r\nas  to  ensure the high standards of the dental profession here.\r\n\r\nMany  are concerned about the Dental Council having full control\r\n\r\nover  the  dentists in Singapore because the application  for  a\r\n\r\nPractising Certificate shall be made in such form and manner  as\r\n\r\nthe  Dental  Council  may require.  Sir,  this  can  become  one\r\n\r\ncontrol  too many for the dentists and be an extra \"bitter  pill\r\n\r\nto  swallow\" for all the dentists, especially if the \"such  form\r\n\r\nand  manner\"  becomes  too restrictive and expensive  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith.   I  would like to urge the Council to practise  restraint\r\n\r\nand  not to use the issuing of the Practising Certificate  as  a\r\n\r\ntool  to  pressurise and to cause extra demands  on  the  dental\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15(5)(b). In this clause, the words \"is not of good\r\n\r\nreputation and character\" are undesirably vague and wide.   This\r\n\r\ncriterion, Sir, is also very subjective.  Perhaps, it should  be\r\n\r\nqualified  by  adding the words \"such as to  render  the  person\r\n\r\nunfit,  in  the interest of the public, to practise his  or  her\r\n\r\nprofession.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17(6) and (7). There are no guidelines as to what\r\n\r\npremises  or  conditions  are deemed unsuitable  for  practising\r\n\r\ndentistry.   There is also no avenue of appeal.  This  makes  it\r\n\r\ndraconian and unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21(1)(e). This appears to be targeted at \"bond\r\n\r\nbreakers\".  There is inevitably a penalty imposed where there is\r\n\r\na  breach of undertaking.  It seems inequitable and unduly harsh\r\n\r\nto deregister a dentist merely on this ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34(1). This clause requires the Dental Council to\r\n\r\nappoint  not  less than five and not more than  10  lay  persons\r\n\r\ntogether  with not less than 10 and not more than 20  registered\r\n\r\ndentists as part of its Complaints Panel.  This means a ratio of\r\n\r\ntwo  registered  dentists to one lay person is possible  in  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Complaints.  Some people may argue that this  will\r\n\r\nresult  in  a  bias  in the assessment of a patient's  complaint\r\n\r\nsince  there is an easy majority of dentists.  The public  would\r\n\r\nprobably  prefer a more balanced representation in the committee\r\n\r\nfor   assessments   to   be  open  and  fair.    An   unbalanced\r\n\r\nrepresentation  may  cause the Committee  of  Complaints  to  be\r\n\r\nperceived as a \"peer review or internal audit panel\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 36(7) and (10). These subclauses state that the\r\n\r\ndentist  concerned shall not have the right to be heard  by  the\r\n\r\nComplaints   Committee  and  shall  not  have  access   to   all\r\n\r\ninformation used by the Complaints Committee.  Sir,  this  is  a\r\n\r\ndenial of natural justice since it is only fair and logical  for\r\n\r\nthe  dentist  to  be allowed an opportunity to  defend  himself.\r\n\r\nThis  is  especially  when the findings  on  each  case  of  the\r\n\r\nComplaints Committee has such important repercussions as  stated\r\n\r\nin  clause 38.  Furthermore, I am concerned whether the findings\r\n\r\nand  recommendations of the Complaints Committee are  admissible\r\n\r\nas evidence in any legal proceedings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39(2) and (3). There is no obligation on the part\r\n\r\nof  the Committee to give its grounds of decision.  How then  is\r\n\r\nit  possible  for  the  aggrieved dentist  to  appeal  with  any\r\n\r\nsubstance?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 44(1). The appointment of a Disciplinary Committee\r\n\r\nas  in  this  Dental Act has been long overdue and  is  urgently\r\n\r\nrequired to deal with the area of misconduct and the appropriate\r\n\r\ndisciplinary actions to be meted out.  Clause 44(1) has  rightly\r\n\r\ncategorised  offences  into  either professional  misconduct  or\r\n\r\nimproper act or conduct and five different ways to deal with  an\r\n\r\noffence.   This  is  superior to that in the  old  Act  where  a\r\n\r\ndentist  could be deregistered for heinous offence or guilty  of\r\n\r\ninfamous or disgraceful conduct in a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprofessional sense.  There was only one penalty in the old  Act,\r\n\r\nregardless of the severity of the misconduct - the wrongdoer had\r\n\r\nto  be struck off the register of dentists.  Clause 44(1)(i)  to\r\n\r\n(v)  of the new Act provides for different types of disciplinary\r\n\r\nactions  from  fine  alone  to temporary  deregistration  before\r\n\r\nremoval of name from the register.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, I would like to say that with this\r\n\r\nDentists  Bill,  we  could have avoided the  awkward  situation,\r\n\r\nwhere  the judgement of the Dental Board last year, in the  case\r\n\r\nof  a  dentist  who was implicated in breach of the  Advertising\r\n\r\nGuidelines, was reversed by the High Court.  While I agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  judgement  of the High Court in this case, I  am  concerned\r\n\r\nabout  conflicting  judgements that may  arise  in  the  future.\r\n\r\nWould that case set a precedent for future cases of disciplinary\r\n\r\nactions by the Dental Council to be freely brought to the Courts\r\n\r\nof  Appeal?  Would that lead to undermining of the authority and\r\n\r\njudgement  of  the Dental Council?  If so, is there  a  question\r\n\r\nmark  over  the legitimacy of the Dental Council and  since  the\r\n\r\nDental Council follows the guidelines of the Dentists Act, would\r\n\r\nthis Act be redundant?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I rise to support the Bill. My\r\n\r\ninterest  in  this  Bill  arose after a  judgement  by  Judicial\r\n\r\nCommissioner  Amarjeet  Singh  which  was  referred  to  by   my\r\n\r\ncolleague  earlier.   In  that  case,  he  mentioned,   in   his\r\n\r\njudgement,  that it is time the Dental Act be  reviewed.   I  am\r\n\r\nglad  that the Government has done that.  In fact, I have  never\r\n\r\nexpected  it  to be done in such a fast speed and I congratulate\r\n\r\nthe Ministry for doing it so quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for this Parliament to review from\r\n\r\ntime to time legislation which are out of time and to repeal and\r\n\r\nre-enact them in keeping with the needs of the society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo has mentioned some of the provisions but I\r\n\r\nwould  like to mention some other provisions.  In particular,  I\r\n\r\nam gratified that now, the Dental Council will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  made up of both elected and appointed members.  My regret is\r\n\r\nthat  the  appointed members would be in the majority.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat, in keeping with the other professional bodies like the Law\r\n\r\nSociety, where only two representatives from the Ministry sit in\r\n\r\nthe Council, we should have more elected persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point that I would also like to commend and\r\n\r\napplaud  is  the  compulsory voting.  It is very  important  for\r\n\r\nprofessionals  to  take an interest in their professional  body,\r\n\r\njust   like  every  Singaporean  is  required  to  vote   in   a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  election.  I think this is a healthy  trend.   We\r\n\r\nshould require that if every professional wants to practise,  he\r\n\r\nmust vote unless he has got exceptional reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the functions of the Council have been well laid down\r\n\r\nand  it  will  help in the growth of the dental profession.   My\r\n\r\nonly concern is on clause 7 \"disqualifications for membership of\r\n\r\nthe  Council\".   Why  should a person  who  is  an  undischarged\r\n\r\nbankrupt not be allowed to sit on the Council?  I can understand\r\n\r\nthe position of an accountant or a lawyer who is handling money.\r\n\r\nBut  a  dentist who is bankrupt can practise but could not serve\r\n\r\non  the  Council.   I  find that this is  a  very  contradictory\r\n\r\nposition.  I hope that this provision could be reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other clause that I am a little concerned is this.\r\n\r\nClause 15(5)(b) refuses to register any applicant who is not  of\r\n\r\ngood  reputation   and  character.  These  are  very  subjective\r\n\r\ntests.   What happens if the dentist has a girlfriend?  Does  it\r\n\r\nmean  that  he is not of good conduct?  I think we must  have  a\r\n\r\ndefinition, Sir.  But I am just stating the worst scenario as an\r\n\r\nexample.  I am asking this House that when we have a legislation\r\n\r\nof  this nature, which is going to be interpreted by the  Dental\r\n\r\nCouncil,  possibly by the court if it goes before the  court,  a\r\n\r\ndefinition  ought to be put in.  In fact, I do  not  think  this\r\n\r\nclause  should be in the Bill at all.  But if we insist  on  it,\r\n\r\nthen we should provide for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other worrying trend is that, with due respect to the\r\n\r\nMinister, the Minister's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndecision  is going to be final in clause 15.  This would  affect\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood of a professional colleague.  It would  be  very\r\n\r\nimportant for us to provide an avenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a refusal, he should have right of audience to\r\n\r\nthe Court.  I may be the only lone voice in this Chamber where I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is very important for us to have a safeguard.   I  am\r\n\r\nquite sure that there would be no abuse but the question is  the\r\n\r\nprecedent  that we are going to set in this House.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will consider this because it is going to  affect  the\r\n\r\ncareer and livelihood of the man.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo has, more than a lawyer, argued the case\r\n\r\nso  well that I cannot add anything further other than those two\r\n\r\ncomments and I ask the Minister to consider the proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nthe  two  Members  for  their support  of  the  Bill  and  their\r\n\r\ncomments.  Let me take the detailed comments in turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo made the comment that in clause 4, applications\r\n\r\nmay  be  made in such form or manner and that she hopes that  in\r\n\r\nadministering  the practising certificates, the  Dental  Council\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  too restrictive.  I assure the  House  that  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of the Dentists Bill is to register and make sure  that\r\n\r\nall  dentists have the qualifications, that they are  physically\r\n\r\nand  mentally  fit  to  practise and  that  they  are  of  sound\r\n\r\ncharacter and reputation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Members questioned the need for clause 15 that\r\n\r\npractising  dentists must be of good reputation  and  character.\r\n\r\nAs  I  said, all dentists, and indeed all professions, must  not\r\n\r\nonly  have  the  qualifications to practise.   I  think  society\r\n\r\nrequires that all professions have certain set standards and one\r\n\r\nof  the  standards  is  that  they be  of  good  reputation  and\r\n\r\ncharacter.  I think that is quite well defined.  The Bill allows\r\n\r\nfor  any person who is not registered because of that clause  to\r\n\r\nhave an avenue of appeal.  This requirement incidentally appears\r\n\r\nin many professional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nActs.  Dr Lee tells me it also applies to veterinarians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Lawyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do not know about lawyers. Maybe\r\n\r\nlawyers do not need to be of good reputation and character to be\r\n\r\nregistered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I object to that remark.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> My apologies. So it is also in the\r\n\r\nLegal  Profession Act.  In that case, there should  not  be  any\r\n\r\nobjection   to  having  this  clause  of  good  reputation   and\r\n\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17(6) and (7) talks about the premises for a dentist\r\n\r\nto practise.  The requirement is for practising in the premises.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not laid out in the Dentists Bill.  In fact, it is  laid\r\n\r\nout  in the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act.  In  that\r\n\r\nAct,  the  criteria  for  premises to  be  registered  for  such\r\n\r\npractices  are quite clearly laid out and also if  the  premises\r\n\r\nare  not registered, the licensing authority is required to give\r\n\r\nreasons why the criteria are not met.  So the applicant can make\r\n\r\ngood the shortfalls and allow their premises to be registered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21(1) talks about bond breaking. We have gone\r\n\r\nthrough  this debate the last time when we discussed the Medical\r\n\r\nRegistration Act.  Basically, the number of applicants  to  both\r\n\r\nthe  medical and dentistry faculties in Singapore is very large.\r\n\r\nWe  have to restrict the numbers.  The courses are conducted  at\r\n\r\ngreat  expense  to  the public.  The courses  are  very  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised and therefore we require students entering these  two\r\n\r\nfaculties  to give an undertaking that they serve the  community\r\n\r\nafter their graduation.  If they break the bond, we will require\r\n\r\nthem to pay up the liquidated damages for breaking the bond.  If\r\n\r\nthey  do not pay the liquidated damages, of course they run  the\r\n\r\nrisk  of being de-registered as a dentist.  I think that is fair\r\n\r\nbecause they are educated at great expense by the community  and\r\n\r\nit is not unfair of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunity to expect them to serve the community in return.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked about the way the Complaints\r\n\r\nCommittee  is  conducted.  Let me explain  that  the  Complaints\r\n\r\nCommittee  is intended as a screening process before a complaint\r\n\r\nis taken up by the Disciplinary Committee.  We want a process by\r\n\r\nwhich  a  complaint by the public or by other  professionals  is\r\n\r\nassessed  to  see whether that complaint is bona  fide  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  should be taken up by the Disciplinary Committee.   There\r\n\r\nis  no  need for the dentist who is complained against to appear\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Complaints Committee.  If he is  required  to  show\r\n\r\ncause,  he  will  have  plenty  of  chances  in  front  of   the\r\n\r\nDisciplinary Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Rai and Dr Lily Neo also referred to a recent case\r\n\r\nwhere a dentist who advertised his services was penalised by the\r\n\r\nDental Board.  He appealed to the High Court and the High  Court\r\n\r\nfelt  that the penalty was too severe, and part of this Bill  is\r\n\r\nin  response  to  that  case to give a  different  gradation  of\r\n\r\npenalties.  It also illustrates that the mechanism that we  have\r\n\r\nset out in the current Bill is the right one and that there is a\r\n\r\ndue   process   through  the  Complaints   Committee   and   the\r\n\r\nDisciplinary  Council,  and if the  dentist  feels  that  he  is\r\n\r\naggrieved,  he can still appeal to the High Court.  And  in  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court,  we  get  the chance to hear  the  appeal  and  the\r\n\r\njudgement can then be taken.  I think the process works well and\r\n\r\nthat is in fact proposed in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VACANCY IN PARLIAMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This motion is subject to signification of\r\n\r\nsupport  by  at  least  one Member.

I hope to demonstrate in the time allotted to me  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of the Government, the party, that is, in  Singapore\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  elections, unlike other countries  where  they\r\n\r\nhave   a  National  Elections  Commission,  giving  proper   and\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  reasons for not holding elections.  We  boast  all\r\n\r\nthe  time  of being accountable, transparent in all our actions.\r\n\r\nBut  we  see  very  little  of it in practice  coming  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   As  I said, we have asked questions  which  remain\r\n\r\nunanswered.   We have asked for further clarification.   All  we\r\n\r\nget is silence.  Sir, I am asking in this House today and hoping\r\n\r\nthat we will get the answers here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there no by-election for the constituency in Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar?  This is a question that not only my Party has asked, but\r\n\r\nseveral  Singaporeans have asked.  I have been asked by  many  a\r\n\r\nperson,  \"Jeyaretnam, do you think there will be  a  by-election\r\n\r\nfor  Jalan  Besar?\"  And even before I could answer  them,  they\r\n\r\nsay,  \"There  never  will, lah. The PAP  will  not  hold  a  by-election.  You know.\"  So, I hope that we will have satisfactory\r\n\r\nanswers if the decision is still not to hold a by-election.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.28 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the question on whether there should be or\r\n\r\nshould not be a by-election depends, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  on\r\n\r\nwhat  we  understand to be a Parliamentary system of government,\r\n\r\nand  whether  we believe in what we say.  That when we  proclaim\r\n\r\nourselves to be practising a Parliamentary system of government,\r\n\r\ndo we really mean it and do we believe in it or is it merely lip\r\n\r\nservice?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMay  I  say that a parliamentary system of government  does  not\r\n\r\nconsist of having a fine building for Parliament.  I do not know\r\n\r\nhow  much  will  be spent on the erection of the new  Parliament\r\n\r\nHouse.   But  fine buildings do not equate with a  parliamentary\r\n\r\nsystem of government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parliamentary system of government can only be found in\r\n\r\ncountries where Parliament is encouraged and allowed to play its\r\n\r\nfull  role in the parliamentary system of government, and  that,\r\n\r\nas  I shall say later, is only possible if every opportunity  is\r\n\r\ngiven  for Parliament to play its role.  And the central gem  of\r\n\r\nParliament is that it is an institution where every voter has  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  in  the institution.  The  parliamentary  system\r\n\r\nrequires   that   in  every  Parliament  there   should   be   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative, representing every single voter in the land, and\r\n\r\nif  he  is  denied  that right, then it  is  a  mockery  of  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  system of government.  So, it is  essential  that\r\n\r\nevery  voter  be  represented in the institution  that  we  call\r\n\r\nParliament.   And this right, of course, was inherent  when,  in\r\n\r\nthe  1950s,  we  chose,  as a people, the  parliamentary  system\r\n\r\nthrough the All-Party Delegation to the United Kingdom.  That we\r\n\r\nwould  prefer  to have a parliamentary system of  government  in\r\n\r\npreference  to  any  other  system  of  government.   We  wanted\r\n\r\nParliament  with  representatives elected by the  people,  every\r\n\r\nsingle  voter represented in Parliament to be the supreme  body.\r\n\r\nThis  right was recognised and enacted in the Constitution  that\r\n\r\nwas handed to us in 1954, and after that.  It recognised that no\r\n\r\nsingle   voter   should  remain  without  a  representation   in\r\n\r\nParliament  for any length of time.  This right was  secured  by\r\n\r\nArticles in the Constitution which required the holding  of  by-elections to fill any vacancy.  You will find that in Article 54\r\n\r\nof  the  Constitution of Malaysia which became our  Constitution\r\n\r\nwhen  we broke away from British rule and went into Malaysia  as\r\n\r\npart of an independent country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may read Article 54 of the Constitution which we, as I\r\n\r\nsaid, accepted for ourselves as part of Malaysia:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever there is a casual vacancy among the Members of\r\n\r\neither House of Parliament, it shall be filled within 60 days [I\r\n\r\nrepeat,  it  shall be filled within 60 days] from  the  date  on\r\n\r\nwhich  it is established that there is a vacancy and an election\r\n\r\nshall be held.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I repeat from that Article, \"it\r\n\r\nshall be filled within 60 days . and an election shall be held.\"\r\n\r\nThat  was the Article in the Constitution when we were  part  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   When  we  came  out of Malaysia,  that  Article  was\r\n\r\namended,  and  that was possible because there were  not  enough\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  in  Parliament,  probably  not   a   single\r\n\r\nOpposition  Member in Parliament, and substituted by Article  49\r\n\r\nof  our  present Constitution.  If I may read the first part  of\r\n\r\nthe Article:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the seat of a Member, not being a non-constituency Member, has become vacant for any reason other than\r\n\r\na  dissolution  of Parliament, the vacancy shall  be  filled  by\r\n\r\nelection in the manner provided by or under any law relating  to\r\n\r\nParliamentary elections for the time being in force.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is all I wish to read from that Article.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I again point out that whilst this Article removes the\r\n\r\nrequirement  of  60  days within which the  vacancy  had  to  be\r\n\r\nfilled, it still requires the vacancy to be filled, because  the\r\n\r\nwords are \"the vacancy shall be filled by election\".  It is  not\r\n\r\n\"may  be  filled at the discretion of the government or  of  the\r\n\r\nruling  party\", but \"shall be filled\".  That was ignored by  the\r\n\r\nruling  party  after  a  by-election,  which  they  have   never\r\n\r\nforgotten,  which took place in 1981.  Previous to  that,  there\r\n\r\nwere regular by-elections to fill vacancies.  But after the  by-election on 31st October 1981, suddenly the ruling party woke up\r\n\r\nto the fact that it would not be in the interest of the party to\r\n\r\nhold a by-election if it might mean an Opposition Member getting\r\n\r\ninto   Parliament.   The  voters  in  Anson  were   denied   any\r\n\r\nrepresentation in Parliament after the Member was forced out and\r\n\r\nthey  were  told,  \"Oh, don't worry, we'll have  caretaker  MPs.\r\n\r\nWe'll  have caretakers for you.\"  But you cannot fend off voters\r\n\r\nwith  nannies/caretakers.   Their  constitutional  right  is   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative in Parliament, chosen by them, not  appointed  by\r\n\r\nanyone, but chosen by them.  So the Anson voters were denied any\r\n\r\nrepresentation in Parliament for quite a while from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n1986  until the 1988 elections, and that was for 2-2 1/2  years.\r\n\r\nIt  was  a blatant denial of their rights and a total breach  of\r\n\r\nthe  parliamentary democracy requirement that every voter should\r\n\r\nhave a representative in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it will, of course, be said, \"but you have other MPs\r\n\r\nin   Jalan  Besar,  have  you  not?\"   And  so  they  are  being\r\n\r\nrepresented in Parliament.  But are they?  And I am referring to\r\n\r\nthe  voters in Whampoa where Mr Choo Wee Khiang represented  the\r\n\r\nvoters.  I know the Workers' Party has never had a GRC, but if I\r\n\r\nmay  explain, as I understand the anatomy of the GRC, it is that\r\n\r\nyou  merge  three  or four constituencies into  a  single  group\r\n\r\nrepresentation constituency.  What happens is that  the  MPs  in\r\n\r\nthe previous single constituencies come together and continue to\r\n\r\nlook  after their particular constituencies.  And so it was  the\r\n\r\ncase  in  Jalan  Besar GRC.  In 1988, when Jalan Besar  GRC  was\r\n\r\nformed,  Dr  Lee  Boon Yang, who was already the  MP  for  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar, continued as one of the group MPs for Jalan Besar, and  I\r\n\r\nhave no doubt that he was looking after the constituency that he\r\n\r\nhad   been   representing  in  Parliament  in  previous   years.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  Mr  Sidek Saniff came over from Kampong  Glam,  when\r\n\r\nKampong   Glam   became   part  of  the   group   representation\r\n\r\nconstituency.  I see Dr Lee is shaking his head.  Maybe  I  have\r\n\r\nnot  got it right.  But the point is that you continue with  the\r\n\r\nparticular constituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, when Whampoa was added to Jalan Besar GRC, Mr Choo\r\n\r\nWee Khiang took the place of Dr Augustine Tan who was the MP for\r\n\r\nWhampoa.   Clearly, there was a delineation.    I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether it happens.  Members are all shaking their heads, and  I\r\n\r\ndo not know how they do it.  But, obviously, that must have been\r\n\r\nthe practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been confirmed by the fact that someone has been\r\n\r\nappointed to look after the voters in Whampoa.  He is to go  and\r\n\r\nadvise them and take care of their affairs.  They are to have  a\r\n\r\ncaretaker.   They  are  to have a man appointed  by  the  ruling\r\n\r\nparty.  So they are not to worry.  The appointment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconfirms what I say.  But it is not just the Whampoa voters that\r\n\r\nI am concerned with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution as introduced by the ruling party\r\n\r\nitself,  Jalan  Besar GRC voters are entitled  to  four  MPs  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  That is their constitutional right.  But  now  they\r\n\r\nhave  not got four MPs in Parliament.  They have only three  MPs\r\n\r\nin  Parliament,  if  you take the voters collectively  in  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar   GRC.   Is  that not a diminution of their constitutional\r\n\r\nright?   I know that Singapore motorists going over the causeway\r\n\r\nhave  to  have a three-quarter tank.  Why should the  voters  of\r\n\r\nJalan Besar be told: \"Be content with the three-quarter tank  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  You cannot have a full tank.  We will  give  you  a\r\n\r\nthree-quarter  tank.\"   Why  should  they?   Is   that   not   a\r\n\r\ndiscrimination from the other GRCs which have a full  complement\r\n\r\nof  their representatives in Parliament?  In failing to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  a  by-election,  may I say that the ruling  party  and  the\r\n\r\nremaining MPs are failing in their primary duty to the voters in\r\n\r\nJalan Besar GRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Edmund Burke, the great\r\n\r\nparliamentarian, in his essay wrote about the primary duty of  a\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament to constituents, and he  said  that  must\r\n\r\nremain  above  all the primary concern.  Should it  not  be  the\r\n\r\nprimary   concern  of  the  MPs  in  Jalan  Besar   that   their\r\n\r\nconstituents,   their  voters,  have  their   full   rights   in\r\n\r\nParliament,  and not just be content with having a three-quarter\r\n\r\nrepresentation in Parliament?  I say that the remaining MPs have\r\n\r\na  duty to ensure this if they are to serve the voters in  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar GRC, let alone the voters in Whampoa.  I say to them  that\r\n\r\nif they want to discharge their duty, the only thing they can do\r\n\r\nis  to allow another MP to be elected.  If it needs for them  to\r\n\r\nresign  and to offer themselves for re-election, that should  be\r\n\r\ndone.   Their  own  convenience and the administrative  problems\r\n\r\nthat  they  think may arise should not stand in the way  of  the\r\n\r\nrights of the voters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This refusal to hold a by-election is seen and perceived,\r\n\r\nnot just by the Workers' Party, but by many a Singaporean, as  a\r\n\r\nblatant refusal to give the opposition\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparties an opportunity to get into Parliament.  That is again  a\r\n\r\ntotal breach of the parliamentary system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one Mr Andre Mathiot, writing about the British\r\n\r\npolitical system in 1958, had this to say:  \"If asked to give  a\r\n\r\nsingle criterion of the democratic Government, I should say that\r\n\r\nit  depended  on  the status of opposition.\"  An  opposition  in\r\n\r\nParliament and an opposition of sufficient numbers, is essential\r\n\r\nto a proper working of parliamentary democracy.  That is what he\r\n\r\nis emphasizing:  \"If I am asked to choose a single criterion,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  it  depended on the status of opposition.\"   So  the\r\n\r\nquestion that will be asked by visitors to Singapore is: what is\r\n\r\nthe  state  of  the opposition in Singapore today,  if  you  are\r\n\r\nclaiming  to  be a democratic Government?  I am not saying  that\r\n\r\nyou  should  therefore lay out the red carpet for the opposition\r\n\r\nand  just  invite them in.  What I am saying is that the  ruling\r\n\r\nparty  should not go out of its way to deny the opposition party\r\n\r\nan  opportunity  to get its representatives into  Parliament  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of citizens who want to see an opposition in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with no disrespect to Members, may I say that no\r\n\r\namount  of Government Backbenchers asking questions of Ministers\r\n\r\nor  no amount of NMPs are a substitute for opposition.  So  this\r\n\r\ndenial  of the opportunity to opposition parties to further  the\r\n\r\ncause of democracy in Singapore by giving them an opportunity to\r\n\r\nhave further representation in Parliament is a blatant denial of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  often  claim  that  we  are  a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.   It  is  the same as the denial  to  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties  outside Parliament, the refusal to let them have  their\r\n\r\nmeetings,  the refusal for them to publicly address the  people,\r\n\r\nthe refusal for them to undertake any political activity without\r\n\r\ngetting a licence first.  They are all deliberate hindrances  to\r\n\r\nthe  advancement  of  the  parliamentary  democracy  system   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But the worst of it, of course, is to deny  through\r\n\r\nextra-parliamentary  means  the  opposition  parties   obtaining\r\n\r\nrepresentation in Parliament.  I say that is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"extra-parliamentary\"  because  the  Constitution  speaks  quite\r\n\r\nclearly  that they should be allowed.  You have to  have  a  by-election  to fill any vacancy and that means an opportunity  for\r\n\r\nthe opposition parties to take part in it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is for two reasons. One, for the rights of the\r\n\r\nvoters  in Jalan Besar GRC in their interest, and second in  the\r\n\r\nnational  interest  of  the country that the  Government  should\r\n\r\nconsider very seriously whether it is right to continue  denying\r\n\r\nthe  voters  and  the  people in Singapore  the  right  to  have\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in  Parliament.  I will deal  briefly  with  the\r\n\r\nanswers given by the Prime Minister.  I am sorry that he is  not\r\n\r\nhere  to  answer these questions.  After all, it is his Ministry\r\n\r\nwhich  is  responsible for holding elections.  That  is  another\r\n\r\nthing.  It breaches the system of parliamentary democracy if the\r\n\r\nholding  of  elections is left entirely  in  the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry, and that is the Prime Minister's Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason given by the Prime Minister appears to be that a\r\n\r\nby-election would distract the nation from the task of  economic\r\n\r\nrecovery.  We could not understand what he was saying.  That  it\r\n\r\nwould  distract  the nation from its task of  economic  recovery\r\n\r\nseems to us a no answer to our question.  So we asked: would you\r\n\r\nplease explain what you are saying?  Are you saying that if  you\r\n\r\nheld  a by-election, all economic activity would come to an end?\r\n\r\nThat people will no longer do any business?  People would not go\r\n\r\nto  work?   The  Stock Exchange would be closed?  And  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  be at a standstill?  It has only got to be stated  to  be\r\n\r\ndismissed.  So that cannot be a valid reason.  It does not stand\r\n\r\nup.   So we asked: could you explain?  We have never heard  from\r\n\r\nhim.   I hope we will hear today, from whoever is replying,  the\r\n\r\ntrue  reason  for this refusal to hold a by-election  for  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar  GRC.   Is  it because - and I am asking  this  seriously,\r\n\r\ncould  we have an answer to it - the ruling Party fears  defeat?\r\n\r\nIf  that  is so, then may I say it does not do the ruling  Party\r\n\r\nany  credit.  It will be dismissed by the electorate as being  a\r\n\r\ntotally irresponsible party, putting its party's interest  above\r\n\r\nthe country's interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister, partly in\r\n\r\nanswer  to  the questions that were asked as to why the  general\r\n\r\nelection held in 1991 was brought forward, and whether it was to\r\n\r\nkeep me out, because I was still disqualified, only waiting  for\r\n\r\nanother  two months for the period to run out, decided  that  he\r\n\r\nwould hold a by-election in 1992.  Unfortunately, we were unable\r\n\r\nto go into it for reasons which had been explained.  And we were\r\n\r\ntaunted by remarks that we chickened out.  May I ask: is the PAP\r\n\r\nchickening  out  this time?  If the PAP is not  chickening  out,\r\n\r\nthen why are we not having a by-election?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just as in the case of Anson, the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections, if this Government decides to  go  its  full\r\n\r\nterm  under the Constitution, elections will not take place  for\r\n\r\nanother  two-and-a-half years.  So for two-and-a-half years  the\r\n\r\nvoters in Whampoa will not have their man chosen by them.  May I\r\n\r\nreturn  to  that?  I have no doubt that when they  canvassed  in\r\n\r\nJalan  Besar GRC, it must have been Mr Choo Wee Khiang who  went\r\n\r\nround  the homes in Whampoa district asking the voters  to  vote\r\n\r\nfor  him, albeit as a member of a team, unless, I am told,  \"No,\r\n\r\nwe  all  four  went round.\"  But I would have thought  that  the\r\n\r\narrangement would have been for Mr Choo Wee Khiang to go  around\r\n\r\nin  Whampoa.  I see Dr Lee shake his head.  He is going to  tell\r\n\r\nus  that all four went round each house in Jalan Besar.  Let  us\r\n\r\nknow.   But Mr Choo has been popularly referred to all the  time\r\n\r\nas the Member from Whampoa.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps may I also say that we suggested to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister that if he is worried about economic activity coming to\r\n\r\na  standstill  and  the by-election a waste of  time,  he  could\r\n\r\ncombine the by-election with the Presidential Election which  is\r\n\r\ndue  under the Constitution by the end of August this year.   Or\r\n\r\nare  we  going  to  be told, \"No, we're not going  to  have  the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Election,  because that  will  also  distract  the\r\n\r\nnation from its economic activity.\"?  Is that going to be  given\r\n\r\nas  a  reason and the Presidential Election put off?  I  suppose\r\n\r\nthat  will be more difficult because the ruling Party will  have\r\n\r\nto bring an amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, of course, aware - I do not want to be told that I\r\n\r\ndid  not mention this - that section 24(2A) of the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections Act which spells out what should happen in the case of\r\n\r\na  vacancy  -  that a writ shall be issued, but  goes  on  in  a\r\n\r\nsubsection  to say that no writ shall be issued in a GRC  unless\r\n\r\nall  members of that GRC have vacated their seats.   May  I  say\r\n\r\nthis.   It  seems  to me, in the first place, to  conflict  with\r\n\r\nArticle 49 of the Constitution which says \"shall be filled\", and\r\n\r\nthere  is a vacancy.  The Speaker announced at the beginning  of\r\n\r\nthis  sitting today that there is a vacancy in Parliament.   You\r\n\r\ncannot  pretend that there is no vacancy.  And the Article  says\r\n\r\nthat  the  \"vacancy shall be filled\".  So the question is,  does\r\n\r\nsection 24(2A) of the Parliamentary Elections Act conflict  with\r\n\r\nArticle 49 of the Constitution?  Of course, the Constitution  is\r\n\r\nsupreme.  It takes precedence over all other laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, quite apart from that, section 24 (2A) is purely a\r\n\r\nprocedural  section.  The substantive section is  still  Article\r\n\r\n49.   And if the only way to satisfy Article 49 is for the other\r\n\r\nmembers to resign, it should be done.  They should resign  their\r\n\r\nseats so that the by-election may be held to comply with Article\r\n\r\n49.   If that is not thought desirable, because the ruling Party\r\n\r\nfears  that it may lose a Minister in Parliament, and that would\r\n\r\nbe  terrible, then the other alternative is to take Whampoa  out\r\n\r\nof  the  Jalan Besar GRC and arrange for a by-election for  that\r\n\r\nparticular  constituency.  It is not good enough to say,  \"Well,\r\n\r\nthat's going to create problems.  You got to have a committee to\r\n\r\nre-draw  the boundary again.\"  In Singapore, that is no problem,\r\n\r\nas  we  say,  because the committee is appointed  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Election is all controlled by the Prime Minister.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be a problem when you have a national elections commission.\r\n\r\nThey  might say, \"Well, we don't think we are going to  do  this\r\n\r\nfor you.\"  But in Singapore it should present no problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that there is a precedent for it. Before the\r\n\r\nlast general elections, MacPherson was taken out of Marine\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nParade  GRC and made into a single constituency.  So you have  a\r\n\r\nprecedent there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ask in this House: what are your reasons then for not\r\n\r\nholding any by-election in Jalan Besar GRC?  And I do appeal  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  to the Prime Minister, to the Government,  and  the\r\n\r\nremaining  Members  in Jalan Besar GRC, that  they  should  rise\r\n\r\nabove  party interest, and not decide the question whether there\r\n\r\nshould be a by-election purely on whether it suits the party  or\r\n\r\nnot, whether it may result in losing a Minister, but whether  in\r\n\r\nthe  national  interest, the Constitution  requires  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be a by-election.  So I do appeal to the Government  and\r\n\r\nto  the  Members  because they can do something  about  this  by\r\n\r\nresigning their seats in Parliament and contesting the seats all\r\n\r\nover again.  If that is done, then may I say the world will see,\r\n\r\nand  Singaporeans will see and understand, that this is a party,\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  ruling  Party,  which believes  in  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  which believes in giving voters their  rights  under\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution,  which  believes  that  there  should  be  an\r\n\r\neffective  Opposition in Parliament and not just  a  party  that\r\n\r\npays  lip  service every time but does not believe  in  what  it\r\n\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Prime Minister, if he is the only one who has\r\n\r\ngot  to  decide this question, will reconsider and if there  are\r\n\r\ngood  reasons,  let us have them, but not facile  reasons  about\r\n\r\neconomic activity coming to a standstill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nalthough  we  are  now  debating  this  motion  that  Parliament\r\n\r\nresolves that there should be a by-election in Jalan Besar  GRC,\r\n\r\nwe  can  envisage  that the motion will not be  passed   because\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister Goh Chok Tong has already made his stand  before\r\n\r\nthis sitting that there will not be a by-election in Jalan Besar\r\n\r\nGRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh said that there would not be a by-election because he did not want to divert the people's focus on\r\n\r\nour economic recovery.  I feel that this is just an excuse.   As\r\n\r\nwe  all know, in Singapore, even in general elections, the whole\r\n\r\nprocess  can be finished within 10 days.  Now, only one  GRC  is\r\n\r\ninvolved.   How  would  this affect our economic  recovery?   In\r\n\r\nfact, there is no need for Prime Minister Goh to seek an excuse.\r\n\r\nHe   could  simply  say  that  according  to  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections Act, there is no need to hold a by-election.  The  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  had in 1988 amended the Parliamentary Elections  Act\r\n\r\nto  the effect that only when all the seats in a GRC are vacant,\r\n\r\nwill  it  be mandatory for a by-election to be held.  Under  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  in  a six-seat GRC, even if there  is  only  one\r\n\r\nMember  left in the GRC, there is no need to hold a by-election.\r\n\r\nThe PAP can just ask some others to help out in the constituency\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this motion is concerned, whether or not we must\r\n\r\nhold  a by-election, it is a foregone conclusion.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nit  still makes sense for us to discuss this issue of whether  a\r\n\r\nby-election  should  be  held under the  present  circumstances,\r\n\r\nbecause  the law in Singapore is often amended again and  again.\r\n\r\nLet  us  go to the   crux of the matter. The crux of the  matter\r\n\r\nlies  with  the Parliamentary Elections Act.  Although  the  Act\r\n\r\nprovides that a by-election is necessary only when all the seats\r\n\r\nin the GRC are vacant, there is no express provision to say when\r\n\r\na  by-election  must be held.  This is a loophole.   Under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  it is for the ruling Party to   decide  when  to\r\n\r\nhold  a  by-election.  They could just drag on  until  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneral election, as they had done in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, when the Anson constituency was vacant, they made\r\n\r\nuse  of  this  loophole in the Parliamentary  Elections  Act  to\r\n\r\nrefrain  from holding a by-election.  The seat was  left  vacant\r\n\r\nall  the time until the general election in 1988 when they split\r\n\r\nAnson  into three parts and have them absorbed into a  GRC.   If\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  Government  is a responsible government,  they  should\r\n\r\namend the Parliamentary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nElections  Act to provide that whenever there is any vacancy  in\r\n\r\nany constituency, a by-election should be held within a specific\r\n\r\nperiod  even  if  there is only one seat in  the  GRC  which  is\r\n\r\nvacant.  In the present situation in the Jalan Besar GRC,   even\r\n\r\nif  all the Members have vacated their seats necessitating a by-election,   there  is no provision to say by when  the  election\r\n\r\nmust  be held.  So if the PAP is a responsible government,  they\r\n\r\nshould urge all GRC Members to resign their seats so that  there\r\n\r\nwill be a by-election.\r\n\r\nIn  the event that the PAP is saying that it is not fair to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  other  Members  to resign, then they  should  consider  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  by my Secretary-General that  Whampoa be  taken  out\r\n\r\nfrom  the  GRC  to form a single constituency, and  hold  a  by-election there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the opposition is the voice of the\r\n\r\npeople.  Presently, the people want a by-election at Jalan Besar\r\n\r\nGRC.  The opposition must voice their desire in Parliament.  But\r\n\r\nthe  Government has a contrary view.  It says that there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed to have a by-election in Jalan Besar GRC.  If a by-election\r\n\r\nis  held  in Jalan Besar GRC, it shall distract the people  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  effort in turning the  economy  around.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  excuse is of course unacceptable.  It  is  a  lame\r\n\r\nexcuse.   How  can  a by-election in one GRC suddenly  stop  all\r\n\r\neconomic  activities in Singapore, stop foreign  investors  from\r\n\r\nwanting  to  invest in Singapore or stop their investments  from\r\n\r\ncoming into Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, I remember in the late 1970s, the Government\r\n\r\nsaid   that  should  one  Opposition  Member  be  elected   into\r\n\r\nParliament,  it  would  drive the foreign  investors  away  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Since then, more than one Member of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nhas been elected to Parliament, and yet Singapore has prospered.\r\n\r\nThe economy has done so well that the Government is able to reap\r\n\r\nunprecedented surpluses each year.  In similar vein, the  excuse\r\n\r\nthat  one  by-election  in Jalan Besar  GRC  will  distract  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  from its efforts to turn the economy around  is  one\r\n\r\nthat  cannot be accepted by the people.  The real reason  is  of\r\n\r\ncourse the memory of Anson.  It was at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnson, in 1981, that the PAP suffered its first defeat after  15\r\n\r\nyears  of  one-party rule.  Mr Jeyaretnam of the Workers'  Party\r\n\r\nbroke  the  one-party  rule by winning the by-election  in  that\r\n\r\nconstituency.   The  defeat jolted the PAP.  The  PAP  machinery\r\n\r\nquickly  started to work and find ways and means to stop another\r\n\r\nAnson from happening.  The best solution of course is to do away\r\n\r\nwith  by-elections altogether.  This solution is 100% foolproof.\r\n\r\nIf  there are no by-elections, there shall be no defeat for  the\r\n\r\nPAP.  It is as simple as that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were vacant seats after 1981. One was at Havelock\r\n\r\nwhen  the  then Minister for Finance Hon Sui Sen died in  office\r\n\r\nand  later Anson itself became vacant due to the ouster  of  its\r\n\r\nincumbent   MP   from   Parliament.   For   those   two   vacant\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  their  terms  were  not  ended  and,  yet,  by-elections  were not called for.  The Government  gave  the  lame\r\n\r\nexcuse  that the Constitution did not state a time frame  within\r\n\r\nwhich  by-elections  have to be called.  Normally,  if  no  time\r\n\r\nlimit  is given for doing an act in the statute, then the  court\r\n\r\nwould  normally  interpret it as an act  to  be  done  within  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  time.  The common law therefore states  that  a  by-election  at Havelock and Anson should have been held  within  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  time  of becoming vacant. I would  say  that  within\r\n\r\nthree months would be a reasonable time.  Yet, by-elections were\r\n\r\nnot held in those two constituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP knew that if they maintained only single seat\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  inevitably  in mid-term,  there  shall  be  by-elections.   For example, there were four vacant wards  in  1979\r\n\r\nand, before the 1984 elections, there were two vacant wards  but\r\n\r\nno  by-elections were held.  After Anson, I would say  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  had a good chance of winning the by-elections.   The\r\n\r\npeople  know for sure that the Government is already  firmly  in\r\n\r\nplace  and  it  cannot  be toppled by a by-election.   For  this\r\n\r\nreason, Singaporeans are more amenable to vote the Opposition at\r\n\r\na  by-election  and the PAP knows that.  That  is  why  the  PAP\r\n\r\ninvented the concept of GRCs and keep the number of single  seat\r\n\r\nconstituencies  to a minimum.  Currently, there  are  only  nine\r\n\r\nsingle seats,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndown  from 22 out of 83 elected seats in Parliament.  Under  the\r\n\r\nGRC system, legally, there is no need to hold a by-election when\r\n\r\none  of  the  component  MPs in the GRC  drops  out,  either  by\r\n\r\nresignation  or  whatever reason.  There shall  only  be  a  by-election  in the GRC when all its MPs are no longer  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.  It is almost impossible for this kind of  situation\r\n\r\nto  happen after the election laws were amended at the beginning\r\n\r\nof 1988.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the amendments, the GRCs currrently are made up of\r\n\r\nfour,  five  or six MPs in a GRC.  It is difficult therefore  to\r\n\r\nenvisage a situation when all four, five or six MPs in  one  GRC\r\n\r\ncompletely leave Parliament.  In these days, the new MPs are  in\r\n\r\ntheir 30s.  They are well-fed, strong and healthy.  I cannot see\r\n\r\nany  one  of  them  falling ill and opting  out  of  Parliament.\r\n\r\nBesides,  I  cannot see young MPs, with so much to  look  ahead,\r\n\r\nvoluntarily resigning unless they are forced to do so like  Choo\r\n\r\nWee Khiang's case at Jalan Besar GRC this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the GRC scheme is aimed at wiping out by-elections. It is noted that the Prime Minister did not use the\r\n\r\nlegal  reason  for  not wanting to hold a by-election  at  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar  GRC,  but instead use an economic reason.  If  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has said that he need not hold a by-election at  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar  GRC  because the law does not require him to do  so,  the\r\n\r\npeople  will be quick to point out that he held one at  his  own\r\n\r\nconstituency in Marine Parade GRC in December 1992.  A precedent\r\n\r\nhas been set at Marine Parade GRC that if he wanted to, he could\r\n\r\ncall  a  by-election   despite the fact that  the  law  did  not\r\n\r\nrequire  him to do so.  In Marine Parade's case, it was  obvious\r\n\r\nto  the PAP that they would win that by-election because it  was\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister's ward and he was an incumbent MP  for  many\r\n\r\nyears.   As regards Jalan Besar, it is no sure winner.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy the PAP is not willing to announce a by-election there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jalan Besar GRC comprises a large part of the former\r\n\r\nRochor constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe PAP still remembers that they nearly lost in Rochor in 1963.\r\n\r\nThe  PAP's  Chairman then, Dr Toh Chin Chye, narrowly  beat  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis candidate, Dr Lee Siew-Choh, by less than  100\r\n\r\nvotes.   The  PAP old guard shuddered when they  talked  of  the\r\n\r\nelection at Rochor constituency in 1963.  They won that election\r\n\r\nonly  by the skin of their teeth.  After that experience,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think that the PAP is going to chance a by-election at Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar.   A mid-term by-election is normally a good time for  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  assess the Government's policies.  The last  general\r\n\r\nelection  was held on 2nd January 1997.  At this point of  time,\r\n\r\nit  is exactly half way through the term before the next general\r\n\r\nelection is held.  So it is a good time for the people to  audit\r\n\r\nwhat  the Government has done up to now, ie, whether the  people\r\n\r\nare  happy  with the Government's policies such as cost  cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures  and  other  policies to  revive  the  economy  or  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's handling of Singapore's relations with Malaysia and\r\n\r\nits other policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should allow itself to be judged purely on\r\n\r\nits performance without massive incentives offered to the people\r\n\r\nlike  in  the last election such as the upgrading of flats.   If\r\n\r\nthe  PAP really believes in democracy, then it should hold a by-election  at  Jalan  Besar  GRC.  The essence  of  democracy  is\r\n\r\nrepresentation  and choice.  The residents at  Jalan  Besar  GRC\r\n\r\nelected   the  original  four  persons  to  represent  them   in\r\n\r\nParliament.  But now the slate of four is left only with  three.\r\n\r\nThe  PAP has sent a former failed candidate at Hougang, Mr  Heng\r\n\r\nChee  How, to fill in that place of the resigned MP.  He may  or\r\n\r\nmay  not be good.  We do not know.  But what we do know is  that\r\n\r\nhe  is  not the choice of the voters at Jalan Besar GRC.  He  is\r\n\r\nthe  choice of the PAP.  The voters at Jalan Besar GRC  must  be\r\n\r\ngiven their democractic right to choose their own representative\r\n\r\nin  Parliament,  not  to force one upon them.   The  PAP  should\r\n\r\nuphold  democracy  and call a by-election at Jalan  Besar.   The\r\n\r\nnext  general election, if it goes its full-term, is to be  held\r\n\r\nin  early  2002.  This Parliamentary term has still 2 1/2  years\r\n\r\nmore to go.  A by-election should be held at Jalan Besar GRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nfirst like to refer to the comments made by the hon. NCMP saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  number of opposition is an indicator of the state  of\r\n\r\nParliamentary  democracy in Singapore and  that  the  number  of\r\n\r\nbackbenchers or NCMPs does not matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that what is more important is to have\r\n\r\na free and fair election.  We have seen that in the region.  You\r\n\r\ncannot predetermine the outcome of elections if you have a free,\r\n\r\nfair  and transparent election like what we have here.  Speaking\r\n\r\nfor  the NMPs, I would like to perhaps remind the hon. NCMP that\r\n\r\nthe NMPs, representing a non-partisan section of the population,\r\n\r\nhas played a useful role not only in Parliament but in the whole\r\n\r\nrange  of  social and community institutions and developing  and\r\n\r\nsupporting a very strong people sector which certainly must be a\r\n\r\nvery important and strong indicator of the state of democracy in\r\n\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the motion, Sir, I would like to say that\r\n\r\none  of  the  objectives of GRCs is the  ability  of  the  other\r\n\r\nelected members in the GRC to carry out its function and  duties\r\n\r\nof  another member in the absence which may be caused by  either\r\n\r\ndeath,  disability or other unforeseen circumstances.   What  is\r\n\r\nmore  difficult in this case is that the constituents in Whampoa\r\n\r\nhave lost their elected Member, not by an act of God, but by  an\r\n\r\nact  of crime.  I suppose in most cases a reasonable voter is  a\r\n\r\nlot more understanding and can be persuaded to see the practical\r\n\r\narguments  against by-election because of the  current  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis and the ability of the other elected Members to carry  on\r\n\r\nwith  the additional responsibilities brought about by the  loss\r\n\r\nof  an  elected Member.  However, there are others who  place  a\r\n\r\nmuch  greater  moral obligation to replace  the  MP  with  other\r\n\r\nelected representatives.  Here, in my own sense is that the  PAP\r\n\r\nsuffers from a very high moral position it occupies of not being\r\n\r\ncorrupt  and taking a firm and strong position even against  its\r\n\r\nown members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFor  this  reason, some may then want the PAP to take that  high\r\n\r\nmoral  position  by calling for a by-election  in  Jalan  Besar.\r\n\r\nThere  are some questions that come to mind in trying to balance\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, even if there is a general perception, which I tend\r\n\r\nto agree, and the feeling that the constituents do not want a by-election, and they see that the other Members are able to  carry\r\n\r\nout  their duties quite effectively because of their good  track\r\n\r\nrecord,  the question then is:  should not we then leave  it  to\r\n\r\nthe  voters through the election process to decide whether  they\r\n\r\nreally want to have their Members of Parliament re-elected?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to ask if we need clearer guidelines\r\n\r\nin  fact to determine the circumstances where a by-election  may\r\n\r\nbe  required, if, say, two Members of Parliament in  a  GRC  are\r\n\r\nunable  to continue office for whatever circumstances.   Because\r\n\r\nthen it can be argued that the remaining MPs would be physically\r\n\r\nincapable of carrying out the functions and duties in  the  GRC.\r\n\r\nI must say that I, like most Singaporeans, can see the practical\r\n\r\nargument for not calling for a by-election in Jalan Besar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, Sir, some Singaporeans are a little\r\n\r\nbit  confused  because  recently  we  heard  that  the  PAP  has\r\n\r\nannounced that Mr Heng Chee How will be sent to the GRC to  look\r\n\r\nafter  some of the duties left behind by the former MP.  Why  is\r\n\r\nthere  a  need to have Mr Heng carry out this duty if the  other\r\n\r\nthree  Members  can effectively perform those  roles?   I  think\r\n\r\nthere  is  some  confusion there.  Perhaps,  we  may  need  some\r\n\r\nclarification. And the clarification is really the role that  Mr\r\n\r\nHeng   will   play  there.   I  do  understand   that   in   all\r\n\r\nconstituencies, we have advisors and helpers, but I  think  what\r\n\r\npeople  would like to see is Mr Heng playing the role,  and  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  the  same role as has been played  by  the  elected\r\n\r\nMember.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, not having a by-election is actually a loss to the\r\n\r\nPAP,  more  than to the Opposition.  In my view, it can  perhaps\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  that Singapore is different from the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nregion.  Because in an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis,  contrary to the experiences  in  the  region,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  economic  crisis has brought  about  a  more  vocal,\r\n\r\nprominent Opposition in local politics, I would think even if  a\r\n\r\nby-election were to be held, it could demonstrate that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  quite  different that despite the crisis, the Government  is\r\n\r\nable  to win elections, because it has, I think, in most  cases,\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  that the Government is a very strong  catalyst  of\r\n\r\nchange  and  reform in Singapore.  I personally do not  see  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  playing  that  role.   So,  that  is  quite  a   big\r\n\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard Mr J B Jeyaretnam, I feel that he has not made\r\n\r\na  very strong case for calling for a by-election.  The vacancy,\r\n\r\nas  I said, was brought about by a crime.  But Mr J B Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nhas  not made a case of that crime basically perhaps because  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's own firm and open attitude in dealing with  it\r\n\r\nvery openly and fairly.  And it is for this reason, Sir, that  I\r\n\r\ncannot give my support to Mr J B Jeyaretnam and his motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want\r\n\r\nto  thank  you for giving me this opportunity to rise  to  speak\r\n\r\nagainst  the motion standing in the name of the Non-Constituency\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam, has once again called for a by-election to be held in Jalan Besar GRC on account of the\r\n\r\nresignation of our erstwhile colleague, Mr Choo Wee Khiang.   Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  seems  confident that if a by-election  were  to  be\r\n\r\ncalled  at this time, he will be able to give the PAP a beating,\r\n\r\nsomething  which  he has tried to do in the  last  election  but\r\n\r\nfailed  dismally.   Even in this House, Mr  Jeyaretnam's  tirade\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government  and  the  Party  sounds  like  an  old\r\n\r\ngramophone  record,  which he plays over  and  over  again.   He\r\n\r\nbegins  by  suggesting that there is a lack of  a  tradition  of\r\n\r\nParliamentary  democracy, the lack of freedom of expression  for\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  and  an inability to allow  the  Opposition  to\r\n\r\nexpress themselves in a forum such as this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the NCMP to account for his presence here in\r\n\r\nParliament today. He is a loser in the last election, as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  previously.  But for the grace of this present Government,\r\n\r\nhe  is able to sit in this Parliament together with the rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  duly elected Members and make his points known in an august\r\n\r\nbody  such as this.  How can Mr Jeyaretnam then say that we  are\r\n\r\nshort  in  the  standards  of  representation  expected   in   a\r\n\r\ndemocracy, as he has described?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You missed the point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> He thinks the PAP is out of sync with the\r\n\r\naspirations of our people.  Perhaps, at this moment, one wonders\r\n\r\nwhether  the issues he raises in this House clearly reflect  the\r\n\r\naspirations of the common man he claims to represent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a lawyer, Mr Jeyaretnam would have realised that\r\n\r\nunder  the  Constitution and relevant laws, there  is  no  legal\r\n\r\nobligation on the part of the Government to call for an election\r\n\r\nafter an MP resigns his seat in Parliament.  The essence of such\r\n\r\na  legal requirement in the Constitution applies both to single-seat  constituencies and to Group Representation  Constituencies\r\n\r\nas  well.  Mr Jeyaretnam cites Article 49 of the Constitution in\r\n\r\nwhich  he used to support his case.  If I may just read  Article\r\n\r\n49 of the Constitution, it simply states:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Whenever the seat of a Member, not being a non-constituency Member, has become vacant for any reason other than\r\n\r\na  dissolution  of Parliament, the vacancy shall  be  filled  by\r\n\r\nelection in the manner provided by or under any law relating  to\r\n\r\nParliamentary elections.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article in the Constitution is therefore largely qualified\r\n\r\nas opposed to what Mr Jeyaretnam appears to have suggested, that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  legal obligation on the part of our Government  to\r\n\r\ncall an election as long as there is a vacancy in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the NCMP has created a mischief by alluding to a\r\n\r\nduty,  that  there is a legal obligation which is obviously  not\r\n\r\ntrue.   If  it  is  an  election to  be  called  in  the  manner\r\n\r\nprescribed  by law, the law is the statute that we  have  before\r\n\r\nus, and that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  the Parliamentary Elections Act.  As a lawyer, I am sure  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  knows  the  Parliamentary  Elections  Act  does  not\r\n\r\nprescribe any particular time limit within which to call for  an\r\n\r\nelection.   That, Sir, is clearly the prerogative of the  ruling\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue was specifically dealt with after we became\r\n\r\nindependent  in  1965.   During that time,  our  Government  has\r\n\r\nspecifically  amended the provisions of our law  to  require  an\r\n\r\nelection  to be held within a period of time after the seat  was\r\n\r\nvacated.  Mr Jeyaretnam so much as conceded that that has  since\r\n\r\nbeen  amended after the election.  Obviously, I could  be  wrong\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Jeyaretnam could be right.  But the  point  is,  if  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam still thinks that there is a legal obligation to hold\r\n\r\nan  election  at the moment in Jalan Besar GRC, then  he  should\r\n\r\napply for a writ of mandamus to compel the Government to do  so.\r\n\r\nHe  is capable of doing it and nobody is ever going to deny  him\r\n\r\nthe  right to petition to Court to issue such a writ.   However,\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam obviously knows that there is no legal obligation\r\n\r\nto hold an election at this moment for Jalan Besar GRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no legal obligation to hold an election\r\n\r\nat this moment, Mr Jeyaretnam is perhaps saying that, as opposed\r\n\r\nto  a  legal obligation, there is a moral obligation to hold  an\r\n\r\nelection instead, and that obviously is the other thrust of  his\r\n\r\nargument.   If so, we should perhaps examine closely whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  such an obligation exists.  By moral obligation, Sir,  what\r\n\r\none  supposes it to mean the expectation based on the values and\r\n\r\nbeliefs of the people comprising the society at large.  By this,\r\n\r\none  would  ask whether or not it is the expectation  placed  on\r\n\r\nParliament and indeed the Government by the people of Whampoa at\r\n\r\nthis  moment to hold a fresh election and to seek a new  mandate\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people of Whampoa to act as their representatives  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one would imagine that when the MPs from Jalan Besar\r\n\r\nGRC  went  to the people at the last election for an endorsement\r\n\r\nof their candidacy , the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  of  Whampoa  voted categorically that  they  wanted  the\r\n\r\npresent  team  to  represent them.  When the  Whampoa  residents\r\n\r\nvoted for their Members of Parliament in the GRC, they did  not,\r\n\r\nin  the  way  in which the election was conducted,  specifically\r\n\r\nvote  for  any  particular  MP to  represent  their  ward.   The\r\n\r\nendorsement was placed on all four Members of Parliament  to  be\r\n\r\ntheir  representatives  and  it  is  on  that  basis  that   the\r\n\r\ncandidates were returned.  Mr Jeyaretnam obviously has  not  got\r\n\r\nhis  laws right.  He seems to think that in a GRC, it is a  just\r\n\r\nconvenient  arrangement  where  you  tie  all  these  individual\r\n\r\nconstituencies together and therefore each Member of  Parliament\r\n\r\nis  specifically  voted by the constituents  in  his  particular\r\n\r\nward.   But  bear  in mind, in the Parliamentary Elections  Act,\r\n\r\nwhen the people vote within a GRC, they voted for an entire team\r\n\r\nand not for any specific individual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be ludicrous for anyone to suggest that\r\n\r\nsince   the   mandate  was  given  to  four  MPs   to   act   as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  in  Parliament,  the  absence  of   one   would\r\n\r\nnecessarily  mean  that  the  rest  have  lost  their  electoral\r\n\r\nmandate.    Such  an  argument,  if  carried  to   its   extreme\r\n\r\nconclusion,  would also mean that at any time if  Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nsteps  down as Secretary-General of the Workers' Party,  Mr  Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang  would  have  to  resign  his  seat  as  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament for Hougang since it can be argued that some  Hougang\r\n\r\nresidents may have voted him because of the leadership  provided\r\n\r\nby Mr Jeyaretnam.  Just because a member of the team resigns his\r\n\r\nseat, it does not necessarily follow that the people would  have\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  their support for the remaining Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nin  the  GRC.   Mr Jeyaretnam must understand that the  existing\r\n\r\nteam for Jalan Besar stood for election and won the election for\r\n\r\nwhat  the PAP stands for and not because Mr Choo Wee Khiang  was\r\n\r\npopular so that without his representation, the mandate  of  the\r\n\r\npeople would be withdrawn in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such an argument against the call for a by-election is\r\n\r\nnot extreme and there are parallel examples found elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFor  instance, taking a leaf from corporations, if a  member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Board of Directors, having been elected to the Board by the\r\n\r\nshareholders and who, before the expiry of the term, resigns his\r\n\r\nBoard  seat, there is no obligation on the part of the Board  to\r\n\r\ngo   back  to  the  shareholders  for  a  fresh  election.   The\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  the company goes on so long as the  Board  feels\r\n\r\nthat  they are not hindered or incapacitated in any way  by  the\r\n\r\nabsence of the member of the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Jalan Besar GRC, what is most critical in\r\n\r\nthe  minds  of  the residents at this moment is whether  or  not\r\n\r\ntheir  interest,  will just be as well-served by  the  remaining\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  within the GRC.  If the level  of  service  and\r\n\r\ncommitment to the residents continues to remain as it was before\r\n\r\nthe  MP  resigned his seat, there is therefore really no  reason\r\n\r\nfor  calling for a fresh election.  The point is how much better\r\n\r\nserved will the people be by calling for a fresh election.  What\r\n\r\nit  means,  however, is that the three existing  MPs  for  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar  GRC would have to work much harder in order to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndemands of the constituents or otherwise they would have a  poor\r\n\r\nshowing at the next general election.  If the people are  indeed\r\n\r\nvery, very unhappy because they feel they have been shortchanged\r\n\r\nby  the  resignation of their MP, then obviously,  there  is  an\r\n\r\navenue  for  them  to  register their unhappiness  at  the  next\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are half-way through the present term of this office and\r\n\r\nit  is  only  approximately another 21/2 years  before  we  are\r\n\r\nrequired  by  law  to go into another general election.   Rather\r\n\r\nthan  calling for a fresh election, we should focus our mind  on\r\n\r\nhow  we  can serve the residents better during this  period.   I\r\n\r\nhave spoken to many Whampoa residents and they feel that a fresh\r\n\r\nelection is not what they want at this moment.  I think it  will\r\n\r\nbe  rather presumptuous on the part of the Opposition Members to\r\n\r\nassume  that this is really what the residents of Whampoa  want.\r\n\r\nWhat  matters  to  them is whether the present  MPs  can  really\r\n\r\nattend to their needs.  I have no doubt that my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncolleagues, including the appointed second advisor, would be  up\r\n\r\nto the task at this moment in serving the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes us wonder, therefore, whether the NCMP's call for\r\n\r\na  by-election is really to serve his purpose and his  political\r\n\r\nparty's  purpose  or to serve the residents' purpose.   Bear  in\r\n\r\nmind  the  huge  expenses involved in calling for a  by-election\r\n\r\nwhen  there is no legal obligation to do so, let me repeat, when\r\n\r\nthere is no legal obligation to do so.  It would be just another\r\n\r\noccasion to show that Mr Jeyaretnam is absolutely callous  about\r\n\r\nthe way public monies are spent, since it is quite obvious to us\r\n\r\nthat his call for a by-election is to serve the interest of  his\r\n\r\nparty, and not of the residents of Jalan Besar GRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, Sir, I beg that the motion not be\r\n\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to join\r\n\r\nin the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not support the motion. Having heard the NCMP and the\r\n\r\nseconder, Mr Low Thia Khiang, I regret that I cannot agree  with\r\n\r\ntheir  reasons.   It  is  clear to me that  there  is  no  legal\r\n\r\nrequirement  for  a by-election under existing  laws.   In  this\r\n\r\nsense,  I think the hon. Member for Hougang, Mr Low Thia Khiang,\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Chiam See Tong, Member for Potong Pasir,  have  got  it\r\n\r\nright, and the NCMP has got it wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think there is another debate about the principles of\r\n\r\ndemocracy and of morality, and these are, basically, around  two\r\n\r\npossible principles.  The first is on the nature of the  offence\r\n\r\nand  the  second  on  the  question of fair  representation  for\r\n\r\nconstituents in a parliamentary democracy like Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the nature of the offence. In the past case of the\r\n\r\nlate Dr Tay Eng Soon in the Eunos GRC, it is clear to us that it\r\n\r\nwas  his  untimely  death that caused the  vacancy.   There  was\r\n\r\ntherefore no question of approbation.  Here, given the nature of\r\n\r\nthe  disqualification faced by the former Member of  Parliament,\r\n\r\nMr Choo Wee Khiang, it could be argued that this might\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave affected how voters have felt if they had known at the time\r\n\r\nof  voting.  That is to say, we could argue that the  nature  of\r\n\r\nthe  offence  vitiates  the vote at the last  general  election.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I believe the Singaporean public as a whole trust  the\r\n\r\nPAP, on a general basis, is not corrupt and, in fact, the events\r\n\r\nin  this  case  evidence that wrong-doing will  be  investigated\r\n\r\nthoroughly  and  punished, no matter  who  is  the  perpetrator.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  think on this ground, the nature of the  offence,\r\n\r\nthere is no need for a by-election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my second point on representation. The\r\n\r\nNCMP  has  stressed at great length that the nature of democracy\r\n\r\nmeans that every voter must have a representative in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThat is true.  But it is a jump from there to suggest that every\r\n\r\nconstituency  must  have  a Member, and  he  misunderstands  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  change  that has been made in Singapore  under  the\r\n\r\nconcept of a Group Representation Constituency (GRC).  These are\r\n\r\nfundamentally  different from single-seat  constituencies.   The\r\n\r\nconcept here is for a team representation.  And this fundamental\r\n\r\nchange  in  Singapore's system has not been understood  by  many\r\n\r\npeople who draw analogies from Britain which does not have  this\r\n\r\nsystem, as the NCMP has done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, my answer to him is quite simple. When he\r\n\r\npoints  to  the  Constitution and suggests that when  a  vacancy\r\n\r\narises,  it  must be filled in certain ways.  But  there  is  no\r\n\r\nvacancy.   Nobody elected Mr Choo Wee Khiang as an  independent,\r\n\r\nseparate  constituency.  It is a team concept.  We do  not  even\r\n\r\nknow  whether  the constituents of Whampoa did, as  a  majority,\r\n\r\nelect  Mr Choo Wee Khiang.  All we know is the official  result.\r\n\r\nFor the Jalan Besar GRC as a whole, the PAP team led by Minister\r\n\r\nDr  Lee Boon Yang won.  So, to me, there is no vacancy and it is\r\n\r\na political question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have analogies to this in other systems. In a system of\r\n\r\nproportional representation, once a party is elected, it  is  up\r\n\r\nto  the party to say who should fill up the slots it has won  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  And I think this shows that our constitutional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem has changed fundamentally from certain English roots, and\r\n\r\nmust be understood on its own terms.  So long as a majority of a\r\n\r\nteam  exists  and  believes  it  can  meet  the  needs  of   the\r\n\r\nconstituents,  I  would  think that Singaporeans  are  pragmatic\r\n\r\nenough to focus on the level of the service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP has a very nice argument that the right of voters\r\n\r\nfor  a  team  then is to have four representatives, rather  than\r\n\r\nthree  which  the  Jalan  Besar  GRC  now  has.   I  think  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  do  not care about the formal numbers.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of function and efficiency, rather than numbers.   And\r\n\r\nso  long as the team tries and believes it can do well, then  it\r\n\r\nshould  be able to continue.  If the team does not do  well  and\r\n\r\ndoes  not  meet the constituency's needs, then there will  be  a\r\n\r\nprice  to  pay  at the next general election.  They  can  choose\r\n\r\nanother team.  In that sense, I think it is very much a question\r\n\r\nof political judgment by the party in power, rather than a legal\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn in this sense to two other points made by,\r\n\r\nfirst,  the  NCMP  and then by the Member for Potong  Pasir,  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam.   The first was that several people  -  I think Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nas  well   -   suggested that the PAP was afraid.  There  was  a\r\n\r\nquestion of fear.  I must, in fairness to the PAP, bring up  the\r\n\r\nMarine  Parade  GRC election.  I think there is  clear  evidence\r\n\r\nthat  where  it  is  felt  there is a  moral  obligation,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh, of all people, had not been afraid to put his  own\r\n\r\nneck on the line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Chiam, the Member for Potong Pasir, made a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  about the fact that it is a by-election.   I  would\r\n\r\nremind  Mr  Chiam  to remind himself that he has  twice  claimed\r\n\r\ncredit  for  the so-called by-election effect at  the  last  two\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections,  and  none of  these  was  the  question  of\r\n\r\ngovernment  at  stake.  And yet in both, the PAP achieved  quite\r\n\r\nsubstantial victories.  I am not pro-PAP.  But I think these are\r\n\r\nfacts  that  must be stated, to be fair to the  debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then turn to the question of why the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\ndecided not to meet\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  request of the Opposition to hold a by-election.  I frankly\r\n\r\ndo not know.  I am not a mind reader.  But if I were to guess, I\r\n\r\nwould  look at some of the elections that are coming up  in  the\r\n\r\ncountries  around us in this time of crisis.  When  we  look  at\r\n\r\nMalaysia, we realise that in the run-up to a possible early snap\r\n\r\nelections,  their  foreign relations seem to be  taking  a  very\r\n\r\naggressive and unreasonable stance at some of our issues.  If we\r\n\r\nlook  at  Thailand's elections  that are coming up and those  in\r\n\r\nSouth  Korea, we will see this as well.  Basically, by-elections\r\n\r\nor  general  elections force both parties to make  their  voices\r\n\r\nmore shrill and more nationalistic.  My bet would be that in the\r\n\r\nThai  general  elections, you will see a lot of statements  made\r\n\r\nabout  nationalism, about foreigners buying up  Thai  companies.\r\n\r\nThat  could  be a problem for us too.  We had a debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  about foreign talent, especially in times of crisis.   Do\r\n\r\nwe  need,  in a time of crisis, therefore, to open up  potential\r\n\r\nfissures?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another stray point made by the NCMP is related to the\r\n\r\nnature  of  Backbenchers and NMPs.  He says that the  nature  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy must be judged by the number of Opposition Members  in\r\n\r\nthe  House.   Well,  I  would say this much.   The  job  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition is to be the next government.  That is their claim in\r\n\r\ndemocratic  theory.   It  is  not  to  ask  questions  here   in\r\n\r\nParliament.  My job, as an NMP, is certainly not to be the  next\r\n\r\ngovernment.   It  is  to  try, as best as  I  can,  to  increase\r\n\r\naccountability and add what little I can to the debate  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   In  this sense, we cannot compare the two.  One  is  an\r\n\r\napple.  The other is an orange.  I do not see what he stands  to\r\n\r\ngain  by  this,  except  for  a stray  bullet  here  and  there.\r\n\r\n[Laughter].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the stray bullet. I would say that while\r\n\r\nthat,  in  theory, taking over government is  the  goal  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, the Opposition has failed to do that so far.  And  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  see,  more  to the points of this motion,  what  a  by-election  would  do  to further the cause of the  Opposition  of\r\n\r\ntrying to be the next government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having talked about the nature of representation and\r\n\r\nemphasised the team GRC concept, I think I have another point to\r\n\r\nmake.  And this is the degree to which a person who is not an MP\r\n\r\ncan  be  allowed  to  take on additional duties  caused  by  the\r\n\r\nvacancy.  It has been widely reported that Mr Heng Chee  How  is\r\n\r\nnow serving as the Second Adviser to Whampoa.  Citizens can,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, help at the grassroots, as can party members who are not\r\n\r\nMPs.   I  think  almost all MPs have somebody from  their  party\r\n\r\nhelping them, as a very close associate.  But I think there must\r\n\r\nbe  a  line  between  what an MP can do and  what  these  normal\r\n\r\ncitizens and party members can do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A legal principle says it quite nicely. The nature of\r\n\r\nparliamentary representation is that it is delegated to  you  as\r\n\r\nelected   MPs.   What  is  delegated  cannot  then  be   further\r\n\r\ndelegated.  There are, in that sense, some things an MP  can  do\r\n\r\nthat  a  non-MP  cannot.   Of course, parliamentary  debate  and\r\n\r\nduties is one of them.  But, also, I would argue, things outside\r\n\r\nthis  House,  eg,  signing letters to Ministries  on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nconstituents, officiating as guest-of-honour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an analogy. When a football team has a\r\n\r\nplayer sent off, the team as a whole is not disqualified, but it\r\n\r\ncannot substitute the sent off player.  The position of the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment is that the team in Jalan Besar can cope and carry on\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  there is no need for  a  by-election.   It  is\r\n\r\nconsistent with that stand.  The PAP team in Jalan Besar  should\r\n\r\nobserve  the differences and, even if Mr Heng serves  as  Second\r\n\r\nAdviser, he should not act as an MP without being elected.  I am\r\n\r\nconfident that the PAP team in Jalan Besar GRC will observe  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional and legal principles of representation  and  fair\r\n\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is for these reasons that I do not support the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam argues and I quote him in his motion that \"in all the\r\n\r\ncircumstances it is only right and proper\" that a by-election be\r\n\r\nheld in Jalan Besar\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGRC  in  view of Mr Choo Wee Khiang's resignation.  I completely\r\n\r\ndisagree with that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quotes us the Singapore Constitution and the Malaysian\r\n\r\nConstitution, Article 54, saying that the Malaysian Constitution\r\n\r\nprovides a limit within which a by-election should be held.  But\r\n\r\nArticle   54  of  the  Malaysian  Constitution  is  really   the\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  Constitution.   Singapore  adopted  it   only   when\r\n\r\nSingapore joined Malaysia in 1963.  Before 1963, we had  in  our\r\n\r\nConstitution  which was then called the Singapore (Constitution)\r\n\r\nOrder  in  Council  1958, Article 44.  And that  Article  44  is\r\n\r\nexactly what we have in today's Constitution Article 49(1) which\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the seat of a Member has become vacant for any\r\n\r\nreason other than a dissolution, the vacancy shall be filled  by\r\n\r\nelection in the manner provided by or under any law for the time\r\n\r\nbeing in force in Singapore.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>This was in the 1958 Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1965 Constitution, we changed it after we left\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   We adopted the same words in the 1958 (Constitution)\r\n\r\nOrder by expunging the words \"within three months from the  date\r\n\r\non  which  it  is  established that there is a vacancy\"  in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Constitution because we did not take the position that\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysians  had taken.  And it is for good reason  that  we\r\n\r\nwent  back  to  the  1958 Constitution,  because  that  was  our\r\n\r\nposition before we went into Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Constitution says, we will hold a by-election \"in\r\n\r\nthe  manner provided by and under any law for the time being  in\r\n\r\nforce\".   The law being in force is our Parliamentary  Elections\r\n\r\nAct.  Section 24(2A) says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In respect of any Group Representation Constituency, no\r\n\r\nwrit  shall  be issued under subsection (1) for an  election  to\r\n\r\nfill a vacancy unless all the Members for that constituency have\r\n\r\nvacated their seats in Parliament.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that we debated the GRC issue during the\r\n\r\ndebates   on  the  amendments  to  the  Constitution   and   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Elections Act, and why we specifically  made  this\r\n\r\nprovision.  We specifically and expressly prohibit the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissue  of  a writ for an election in a GRC, unless all  the  MPs\r\n\r\nresign  their  seats.  The legislative intent then  was  not  to\r\n\r\nallow any particular MP so elected as part of a group of MPs for\r\n\r\nthe  GRC  to  hold  the  rest to ransom through  resignation  or\r\n\r\notherwise.  The thinking then was that all the other MPs  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  forced  to  vacate their seats on  account  of  one  MP\r\n\r\nvacating his seat for whatever reason  -  death, resignation  or\r\n\r\nwhatever.  So it is quite clear that under our law, it expressly\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the exclusion of the issue of a writ  for  a  by-election  in  a  GRC.   That  is the  legal  position  which  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam may well know, and some of our colleagues  here  have\r\n\r\nalso mentioned this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no conflict between Article 49 of our\r\n\r\nConstitution and section 24 of the Parliamentary Elections Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no breach of parliamentary democracy, as Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam has suggested.  As Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr  Simon  Tay\r\n\r\nhave said, the MPs in a GRC are elected together as a team,  and\r\n\r\nnot  singly.   This  is  our GRC system.   I  choose  the  words\r\n\r\n\"Whampoa   area\".    There  is  no  such   thing   as   \"Whampoa\r\n\r\nConstituency\".  The GRC is Jalan Besar GRC.  The number  of  MPs\r\n\r\nthere  is four.  By an internal arrangement, Mr Choo Wee  Khiang\r\n\r\nwent to work in Whampoa and Kallang and also by arrangement, the\r\n\r\nMPs in the area also take turns to visit one another's area when\r\n\r\nthey   have    block   parties,  block  visits,  meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions,  and  so on.  For example, at the end of  every  third\r\n\r\nTuesday  of  the  month,  I  am in another  Branch  meeting  the\r\n\r\nresidents who may be living in the Sin Ming area or in  the  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh East area.  Similarly, the MP in that area will come to my\r\n\r\narea.  We are MPs of that  GRC.  We do not just belong to Bishan\r\n\r\nEast, like myself, for example.  Neither does Mr Choo Wee Khiang\r\n\r\nbelong to Whampoa only.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in 1997 the voters elected the four of them, Dr Lee Boon\r\n\r\nYang, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Mr Peh Chin Hua and Mr Choo Wee Khiang,\r\n\r\nas  one  team.  Dr Lee Boon Yang also canvassed in  the  Whampoa\r\n\r\narea  together with Choo Wee Khiang.  Similarly, he did the same\r\n\r\nthing in Geylang West with Peh Chin Hua or in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nKolam  Ayer  together with Dr Yaacob Ibrahim.  So  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason  whatsoever for the remaining MPs to resign just  because\r\n\r\none  MP  has resigned.  In fact, I would say that the  remaining\r\n\r\nMPs  have  a  moral  obligation to carry on  and  implement  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  which  they promised and pledged to  the  voters  in\r\n\r\n1997.   Of  course,  this means that they have  to  work  a  bit\r\n\r\nharder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann talks about the example of a board. It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  need to resign if one board member resigns  and  they\r\n\r\nneed  to  call an AGM.  There is no such requirement.  Mr  Simon\r\n\r\nTay gave the analogy of football.  I can also use the analogy of\r\n\r\nfootball.   If  the  striker beats up the referee  for  a  wrong\r\n\r\nruling  and the referee gives him the red card, he is out.   But\r\n\r\nthat does not mean that the other 10 members have to quit.  They\r\n\r\nwill carry on and they will play hard, and they will win if they\r\n\r\nplay  very hard.  It is the same thing for the three MPs now  in\r\n\r\nJalan Besar GRC.  They work hard and they will work very hard so\r\n\r\nthat  through their efforts they will be returned again.  I have\r\n\r\nno doubt that they will be returned again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the three of them lost no time in making\r\n\r\narrangements to cover the Whampoa area since Mr Choo Wee  Khiang\r\n\r\nwent on leave of absence in December last year.  They took turns\r\n\r\nto  attend meet-the-people sessions.  They took turns to  attend\r\n\r\nthe  RC  functions, block parties, house visits and so  on.   So\r\n\r\nthey  are still active.  They remain active, and they will  have\r\n\r\nto be active.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is Mr Heng Chee How sent there? Is it to replace Mr\r\n\r\nChoo Wee Khiang?  Certainly not.  Mr Choo Wee Khiang was elected\r\n\r\ntogether  with the others.  Mr Heng cannot be appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  represent  the  people.   He  is  not  there  to\r\n\r\nrepresent the people.  He is there - the PAP always plans  ahead\r\n\r\n-  for training.  We sent him there for training so that he gets\r\n\r\nground  experience on how to work with people, how to understand\r\n\r\nthe  issues  and concerns, how to deal with their  problems  and\r\n\r\nhelp them with their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblems.   But  in the signing of letters during the  meet-the-people  session, the three current MPs will still  be  there  by\r\n\r\nrotation to take care of such cases, as they do for block  party\r\n\r\nattendance and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no question that the constitutional rights of\r\n\r\nthe  voters  in Whampoa have been diminished.  They  have  their\r\n\r\nrights.  They voted for the four MPs and the MPs carry on.   The\r\n\r\nvoters,  in fact, voted with the knowledge that should a vacancy\r\n\r\narise, such a vacancy need not be filled, as provided for in our\r\n\r\nlaw.  There is no question that the mandate has been thwarted or\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.   So  regardless of the reasons or the  circumstances\r\n\r\nunder  which  an MP has to resign, there is no need  for  a  by-election  because the existing MPs will carry on with  the  task\r\n\r\nwhich they have been entrusted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam must be fooling himself when he said that the\r\n\r\nPAP  is  afraid  to lose the by-election in Jalan Besar  because\r\n\r\naccording to him that is the only reason why we do not  want  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  by-election.   He  said that the  PAP  accused  him  of\r\n\r\nchickening out in the Marine Parade by-election.  I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhy  he chickened out.  Maybe he did not chicken out but he  was\r\n\r\nplayed  out!   There were four of them.  One  of  them  who  was\r\n\r\nsupposed to be there with him happened to be somewhere  else  in\r\n\r\nJurong  and  lost his way.  He was supposed to be in the  Marine\r\n\r\nParade  nomination  centre  but he could not  find  his  way  to\r\n\r\nMarine Parade.  So he should find out why that team-mate of  his\r\n\r\ndecided  not to turn up.  Maybe he chickened out.  So there  was\r\n\r\ngood  reason  why the PAP said the Workers' Party chickened  out\r\n\r\nbecause they did not find the right person to contest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason why the PAP should fear a loss in a by-election either. We won convincingly in 1997 - 67.7% of the\r\n\r\nvotes.  There is no question that we will win again should there\r\n\r\nbe  a  contest.  I read Mr Jeyaretnam saying that he would  quit\r\n\r\npolitics if he were to contest and lose.  We do not want him  to\r\n\r\nlose.   We  want him to remain here.  It would be a pity  if  he\r\n\r\nwere  to contest and lose.  In fact, his presence here is a good\r\n\r\nlesson for all Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  that  is  the  kind  of  opposition  leaders  we  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I think it is a salutary lesson.  If the opposition\r\n\r\ndoes not wake up, then they may lose again in the next election.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is a lesson not just for Singaporeans but also a  lesson\r\n\r\nfor the opposition parties themselves to find the right kind  of\r\n\r\npeople to lead them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam, in fact, said that we should have a by-election\r\n\r\nto put the Government's handling of the economy to the test.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  need a by-election to put the Government's handling  of\r\n\r\nthe  economy to the test.  If he had been following events,  and\r\n\r\nreading  reports from financial analysts, from people who  know,\r\n\r\nthey  have  said that Singapore indeed has come out with  flying\r\n\r\ncolours  in the way we have handled the economy.  But  the  real\r\n\r\ntest  is, at the end of the term, how would the people vote  for\r\n\r\nthe  PAP?  That is the real test, not in a by-election.  So what\r\n\r\ndoes  he want?  To get an opportunity to contest?  But his party\r\n\r\ncannot  even  get  organised.  So he would  not  be  contesting.\r\n\r\nMaybe he would leave it to Mr Jeyaretnam.  I do not know whether\r\n\r\nthe Workers' Party could also be organised to contest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's record for good governance is widely\r\n\r\nacknowledged.  So we do not need to have a by-election  to  test\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  Mr Jeyaretnam also suggests that  maybe  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  like  this, we should save money and have the Presidential\r\n\r\nelection  together with the by-election.  That  is  a  facetious\r\n\r\nargument.   A  Presidential  election  is  vastly  different  in\r\n\r\npurpose,  scope  and  format compared  to  a  by-election.   The\r\n\r\ncandidates   are  different,  the  issues  are  different,   the\r\n\r\nobjectives  are  different.   So we  should  not  hold  the  two\r\n\r\ntogether and confuse our electorate with two different elections\r\n\r\ngoing on at the same time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prerogative to call a by-election, \"considering all the\r\n\r\ncircumstances\",  really  rests with  the  Prime  Minister.   His\r\n\r\ndecision  will  be based on the best interest of Singapore.   He\r\n\r\nhas explained why he has decided not to call a by-election.   He\r\n\r\nwants  Singaporeans to focus on our incipient economic recovery.\r\n\r\nDo not take for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngranted  that our economic growth is assured.  Look  around  us.\r\n\r\nMany  things  can  still happen and it is  still  in  the  early\r\n\r\nstages.  So despite the changes and the rising stock market,  do\r\n\r\nnot  take  for granted that things will be good.  This  was  the\r\n\r\nsame  message that we put out even before the 1997  crisis.   We\r\n\r\nsaid:  \"Don't  take things for granted.\"  The people  said,  \"It\r\n\r\ncannot  happen.  The PAP will handle it.\"  Indeed,  we  have  an\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis  due to external reasons.   So  for  very  good\r\n\r\nreason, do not take things for granted.  The Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nindeed  cautioned Singaporeans against assuming that the current\r\n\r\nupturn would be quick or permanent.  He feels that a by-election\r\n\r\nheld  at  this time will be a distraction from the main task  in\r\n\r\nseeing through this economic recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans on the whole appreciate that the\r\n\r\nGovernment's far-sighted policies have stood the test  of  time,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  this time of regional economic  crisis.   They\r\n\r\nalso know that the Government has acted decisively to review and\r\n\r\nimprove  many  of  its policies, some in very fundamental  ways,\r\n\r\nlike  the  way we handle our financial institutions  and  banks.\r\n\r\nEnsuring that these revised policies are implemented effectively\r\n\r\nand  successfully will therefore require the undivided attention\r\n\r\nof  all  Singaporeans.   I  think that  should  be  our  primary\r\n\r\nobjective.   It is not the time for fractiousness  and  partisan\r\n\r\npolitics which a by-election will foment. This is the pragmatic,\r\n\r\nhard-headed  approach that we have taken which  has  worked  for\r\n\r\nSingapore all these years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition parties, on the other hand, like what Mr\r\n\r\nSimon   Tay  has  alluded  to,  want  excitement  and  political\r\n\r\nagitation.   They  have had their day during  the  last  general\r\n\r\nelections  and they made no impact.  Two Members were  returned.\r\n\r\nThere  is no reason why the Government should satisfy the vanity\r\n\r\nof certain opposition figures by holding a by-election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predictably, the opposition makes loud calls for a by-election to be held. But Mr Jeyaretnam fools himself if he\r\n\r\nthinks  that  having  a by-election is the topmost  priority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans now.  Not holding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  by-election  is not a breach of parliamentary democracy.   In\r\n\r\naccordance  with the law, the electorate has a choice  at  every\r\n\r\ngeneral election.  The law does not require a by-election to  be\r\n\r\nheld  when an MP in a GRC vacates his seat for whatever  reason.\r\n\r\nThe law provides leeway to the Prime Minister to decide.  If  he\r\n\r\nconsiders it necessary, by-elections will be held.  The PAP  has\r\n\r\nnot  shied  away  from by-elections in the  past.   As  for  the\r\n\r\nvacancy  that has arisen at Jalan Besar GRC, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  decided that, on balance, it is not necessary nor is it  in\r\n\r\nour interest to hold one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have sat through\r\n\r\nall   the  speeches  and,  apart  from  the  speakers  from  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members in Parliament, the sum total of  the  answer\r\n\r\nfrom  NMPs  and  PAP MPs seems to be \"Section  24(2A)  does  not\r\n\r\nrequire  us,  so  we  would not hold any  by-election.\"   May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that that is a lame excuse of people who fear  defeats.\r\n\r\nThey hide behind a legal excuse for them and not face up to  the\r\n\r\nrealities.   I am aware of section 24(2A).  I pointed  out  what\r\n\r\nArticle 49 of the Constitution says.  It does not say \"leave out\r\n\r\nGRCs\".   It says \"leave out only NCMP post\", but in every  other\r\n\r\ncase  the vacancy \"shall be filled.\"  There are no two  ways  of\r\n\r\nreading  it.  The vacancy shall be filled.  As Mr Chiam  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  \"shall be filled\" cannot be interpreted as saying  you  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  to hold it till the next elections.  But is that  how\r\n\r\nthe  Article is to be interpreted, that you do not have to  hold\r\n\r\nany by-election?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 24(2A), as I said, in the first place, would appear\r\n\r\nto  conflict  with Article 49.  I am challenged to  take  it  to\r\n\r\ncourt.  But better than the court it would be for this House  to\r\n\r\nresolve that notwithstanding section 24(2A), there should  be  a\r\n\r\nby-election in Jalan Besar GRC.  It is within the competence  of\r\n\r\nthis House.  Parliament can pass a resolution.  So I do not have\r\n\r\nto  take  it to court.  I come to Parliament which,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, is the supreme body in a parliamentary democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal very briefly. As I said, the main theme\r\n\r\nseems  to be that we do not have to hold it, we have got section\r\n\r\n24(2A) behind us.  The other reasons are simply just by the way.\r\n\r\nBut if I may just reply to one or two of these criticisms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin said that I had not made out a strong\r\n\r\ncase.   I  do not know what he meant by not making out a  strong\r\n\r\ncase.   I  did  not follow what he said about PAP  having  shown\r\n\r\nitself  to come down on criminal activities.  What has that  got\r\n\r\nto  do with representation in Parliament?  Just because the  PAP\r\n\r\nhas  prosecuted - is that what he is saying - Mr Choo Wee Khiang\r\n\r\nin court and had him punished, that there is no need to hold any\r\n\r\nby-election?  Is that the argument?  I do not quite follow that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think almost every speaker mentioned about the practical\r\n\r\narrangements  that have been made by the PAP, how  wonderful  it\r\n\r\nis, that they can send Mr Heng Chee How to look after voters  in\r\n\r\nWhampoa.  But that again misses the point.  Heng Chee How, as Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  mentioned, is not the choice of the voters yet.   And  he\r\n\r\ncannot by any stretch of the imagination be asked to do the work\r\n\r\nof  an MP there.  They need an MP to do the work in Whampoa, not\r\n\r\nMr Heng Chee How.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the third speaker also talked about free and fair\r\n\r\nelections.   This was taken up by Mr Sin Boon Ann and  Mr  Simon\r\n\r\nTay,  says, \"Oh, the Opposition got a sound beating in the  last\r\n\r\nelections.\"   So  there  is no question about  Singaporeans  not\r\n\r\nwanting  an Opposition in Parliament, that they do not want  any\r\n\r\nOpposition in Parliament.  That again, with respect, ignores the\r\n\r\nrealities.  I have to, at the risk of repetition, go back to our\r\n\r\nown  particular  experience in Cheng  San.   Why  did  we  lose?\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the  threats and intimidation, extra-parliamentary,\r\n\r\nextra-legal  methods used by the PAP, by the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nhis two Deputy Prime Ministers invading our own pitches in Cheng\r\n\r\nSan,  and  watching over the voters.  And to say that we  got  a\r\n\r\nsound  beating  is to miss entirely the point  and  to  see  the\r\n\r\nelections through the PAP glasses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Simon Tay also brought up\r\n\r\nexamples.   Mr  Sin  Boon Ann talks about a board  of  companies\r\n\r\nlosing a director.  I am afraid I cannot  see the analogy.  They\r\n\r\nare  quite  different things.  And the football  team  which  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon Tay talks about, I am afraid I cannot really see what  the\r\n\r\nanalogy  is  between  a  football  team  and  having  your   own\r\n\r\nrepresentatives in Parliament.  But what really astounded me was\r\n\r\nMr  Simon  Tay's  announcement  that  there  is  no  vacancy  in\r\n\r\nParliament.   As  I have pointed out when I spoke,  the  Speaker\r\n\r\nonly  this  afternoon  announced that there  was  a  vacancy  in\r\n\r\nParliament  from 2nd June this year.  So what is  Mr  Simon  Tay\r\n\r\nsaying  that there is no vacancy?  Was the Speaker speaking  out\r\n\r\nof turn when he announced that there was a vacancy?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask whether the NCMP will give the\r\n\r\nfloor to me?  Will you allow clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If you want, speak afterwards, Mr Simon\r\n\r\nTay.   But  did you not say that there was no vacancy?   If  you\r\n\r\nwant  to  clarify, you should have clarified it  then.   And  he\r\n\r\nharps  on  Opposition Members failing so far.   This  was  again\r\n\r\ntaken  up by the Minister.  The proof of the pudding is  in  the\r\n\r\neating, they say.  And here is an opportunity to have just  that\r\n\r\n-  to  see  whether the Opposition Members have failed  or  not.\r\n\r\nWill you take up the challenge?  Or will you just say, \"Ah,  but\r\n\r\nsection  24(2A) says we don't have to.\"  Will you  take  up  the\r\n\r\nchallenge?  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Let  the\r\n\r\nelectorate in Jalan Besar decide whether the Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nare failing or not, or whether they would like to see Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no good indulging in words without being prepared to\r\n\r\nput  your words to the test.  He says that the PAP has no  fear.\r\n\r\nAnd I thought the Minister would be giving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nus  sound reasons for not holding a by-election.  But he says PM\r\n\r\nhas   given  his  reason.   We  should  have  expected   greater\r\n\r\nclarification of what the PM was trying to say.  But we did  not\r\n\r\nget  that.  What was the Prime Minister saying when he said  \"to\r\n\r\ndistract the nation from its economic activities\"?  What was  he\r\n\r\ntrying  to say?  Just mere words without any meaning?  If  there\r\n\r\nis  a  meaning, what is it?  Let us have it.  And we do not  get\r\n\r\nany of these.  So I do not know if there is anything else for me\r\n\r\nto answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, have you got any more\r\n\r\nnew points?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes. I do not think there is anything more\r\n\r\nfor  me to answer.  I am just coming to that, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nif  you  will  bear with me.  I was just saying  that  it  would\r\n\r\nappear  there is nothing more to answer.  Because  all  we  have\r\n\r\nheard is just one reason.  It is a pity.  But I think the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  will see.  They will read, I hope,  something  of\r\n\r\nwhat was said today and they will judge for themselves.  In  the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis,  it  is the people.  And  it  is  the  people's\r\n\r\njudgement  that we must accept.  The conclusion I get from  this\r\n\r\nevening's  debate is that the PAP is not prepared  to  face  the\r\n\r\npeople and accept their verdict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed. \" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-nine minutes</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">past Six o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OVERSEAS VOTING FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Prime Minister, for the\r\n\r\nPresidential  elections, whether Singaporeans who  are  overseas\r\n\r\nwill be allowed to vote at Singapore's missions overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng (for the Prime Minister):</b>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter of overseas voting was last raised in\r\n\r\nParliament  in  October  1998.

School\r\n\r\ndiscipline  masters/mistresses and  disciplinary  teachers  from\r\n\r\nsecondary schools are appointed as honorary VSC senior officers.\r\n\r\nThese honorary VSC officers serve as school liaison officers  in\r\n\r\nnetworking with the Police.

It is a 6-month supervision\r\n\r\nand  counselling  programme which involves the  parents  of  the\r\n\r\noffenders.   The  programme aims to help the juvenile  offenders\r\n\r\nrecognise the seriousness and consequences of their act  and  to\r\n\r\nacquire  life-skills and self-control.  It also  aims  to  equip\r\n\r\nparents  with  the necessary skills and knowledge for  effective\r\n\r\nparenting.   Upon successful completion of the programme,  these\r\n\r\njuvenile  offenders may be cautioned by Police in lieu of  Court\r\n\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;StreetWise Programme\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The StreetWise Programme, initiated by the National Youth\r\n\r\nCouncil  and Police, is a 6-month programme designed  to  change\r\n\r\nthe  behaviour of youths who have unwittingly drifted into  gang\r\n\r\nactivities.   Youths  who  are identified  as  gang  members  or\r\n\r\nassociating with gang activities, but where there are mitigating\r\n\r\nfactors, may be placed under this programme.  The programme aims\r\n\r\nto  inculcate life skills and discipline through counselling and\r\n\r\ndevelopmental  training sessions, as well as  voluntary  curfew.\r\n\r\nJuveniles  involved in serious offences with mitigating  factors\r\n\r\nmay also be placed under this programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restriction on Participation in Tea Dances\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juveniles have been restricted from patronising\r\n\r\nentertainment outlets that serve alcohol with dancing facilities\r\n\r\nor  tea  dances.

The E-commerce industry is still a very new\r\n\r\nindustry,  whose impact on the economy,  not just for Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  also  for the global economy cannot be correctly estimated.\r\n\r\nBut  its  rapid growth confirms the conclusion of most  analysts\r\n\r\nthat this is major global trend with far-reaching effects.   The\r\n\r\nproblem of estimation arises because the industry is potentially\r\n\r\nvery broad and cuts many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic   sectors,  making  any  computation   of   the   exact\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  E-commerce activities on the  existing  value-chain  a  complicated undertaking. Singapore is however  keeping\r\n\r\nabreast  of statistical developments relating to the measurement\r\n\r\nof E-commerce, where there is still no international consensus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, DOS launched a new survey1 to obtain\r\n\r\ninformation pertaining to electronic commerce (EC) activities in\r\n\r\nSingapore to enhance our understanding of this emerging  sector.\r\n\r\nThe  full  set  of  results would be published  in  due  course.\r\n\r\nPreliminary   findings  confirm  that  the   E-commerce   growth\r\n\r\npotential  in  Singapore is good, even if the  actual  level  of\r\n\r\nactivity  is  still  small at the moment. For  example,  revenue\r\n\r\nderived from EC supporting services amounted to S$144 million in\r\n\r\n1997.  This soared 85% to S$267 million in 1998 and is  expected\r\n\r\nto  increase by another 34% to S$359 million in 1999. The  focus\r\n\r\nremains  primarily  on business-to-business  (B2B)  rather  than\r\n\r\nbusiness-to-consumer  (B2C).  Similar  projections  by  agencies\r\n\r\nlike  the International Data Corporation (IDC) also paint a very\r\n\r\noptimistic  scenario. IDC projected that E-commerce  revenue  in\r\n\r\nSingapore would grow by about 110% per year over 1998~2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have comprehensive data on the percentage of\r\n\r\nsmall  and  medium-sized enterprises which have embarked  on  E-commerce. However, a recent NCB sample survey on the state of E-\r\n\r\ncommerce  readiness  (based  on  a  sample  of  more  than  1000\r\n\r\ncompanies in 8 industry sectors) showed a high level of Internet-readiness  among  companies  in the selected  industry  sectors,\r\n\r\nnotably  in the manufacturers of electronic products. About  73%\r\n\r\nof  the companies surveyed already had corporate Internet access\r\n\r\nand over a third owned corporate websites.  About 9% already use\r\n\r\nthe Internet to conduct business-to-business e-commerce.  Of the\r\n\r\ncompanies  already  procuring through  the  Internet,  57%  were\r\n\r\nalready  procuring  through  Web-based  trading  platforms   and\r\n\r\nanother  32% used e-mail.  The survey, however highlighted  that\r\n\r\nmany  small  and  medium-sized companies were  still  relatively\r\n\r\nbehind  larger  companies  in the  area  of  E-commerce.  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant for these SMEs to do more to move into E-commerce,  by\r\n\r\ntaking  advantage  of  various Government schemes  currently  in\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corroborating our state of overall EC readiness, the World\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness   1999   ranking  of  whether   the   E-commerce\r\n\r\nenvironment    is    sufficiently   developed    for    business\r\n\r\nopportunities,  ranked Singapore as the 3rd, after  Iceland  and\r\n\r\nFinland. (In comparison, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea  were\r\n\r\nranked 13th, 16th and 40th respectively.)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will continue to promote global companies to base\r\n\r\ntheir E-commerce hubs in Singapore to further grow the industry.\r\n\r\nEDB  targets  to  anchor at least 25 of the  leading  logistics,\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services companies to set up their  e-commerce\r\n\r\noperations  in Singapore by 2003, in order to tap the tremendous\r\n\r\ngrowth worldwide2.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NUMBER OF TOURISTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry  what  is  the number of tourists  that  have  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore during the second quarter of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimated 1.65 million tourists came to Singapore\r\n\r\nduring the second quarter of 1999, about the same number as that\r\n\r\nfor  the first quarter of the year.
