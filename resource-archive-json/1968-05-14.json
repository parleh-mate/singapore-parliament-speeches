Last year, of\r\n\r\nthe 144,000 students in secondary schools, only\r\n\r\n18,000 were in technical and vocational schools.\r\n\r\nThe ratio is about seven to one. Last year, we\r\n\r\nproduced 417 engineers and scientists as compared\r\n\r\nwith 178 at the sub-professional level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We compare very poorly with other industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries. Take Japan for example; for every five\r\n\r\nsecondary school students, two are in the\r\n\r\ntechnical and vocational schools, and for every\r\n\r\nprofessional engineer they produce, there are\r\n\r\nabout five supporting skilled technicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we need skilled workmen to\r\n\r\nbuild and repair ships and sailors and officers to\r\n\r\nman them, personnel to run our hotels, builders to\r\n\r\nmeet the demands created by our plans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non housing, urban renewal and development. In\r\n\r\nshort, in order that our plans on\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and economic development may\r\n\r\ncontinue to be successful, as it has been, we must\r\n\r\nhave sufficient and capable human talent in the\r\n\r\ntop strata, but, more important, we must also\r\n\r\nprovide a much larger group of supporting\r\n\r\npersonnel in the lower echelons. We need to\r\n\r\nreorganise our educational system to meet this\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I digress a bit? When we\r\n\r\nreorganise our secondary education system, we also\r\n\r\nkeep in mind the womenfolk of this country. I can\r\n\r\nassure the Member for Delta that the only outlet\r\n\r\nfor women is not in bars as waitresses or as dance\r\n\r\nhostesses. For example, at the Productivity Centre\r\n\r\nof the Economic Development Board, a course is run\r\n\r\nexclusively for girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come back to the main issue. Sir, may I be\r\n\r\npermitted to go briefly into the types of\r\n\r\npersonnel that we require to meet our industrial\r\n\r\nneeds? We have engineers, planners, etc, at the\r\n\r\nprofessional level, and down the ladder, we have\r\n\r\nsenior technicians, technicians, craftsmen and\r\n\r\noperatives. The senior technicians, whom we\r\n\r\ngenerally call technical assistants, are trained\r\n\r\nat the Singapore Polytechnic for the Technician\r\n\r\nDiploma. Already, we have the cream of the\r\n\r\nsecondary school students taking these courses.\r\n\r\nSome of them even have the Higher School\r\n\r\nCertificate. Last year, for example, the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic received about 2,000 applications for\r\n\r\nabout 700 vacancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have technicians and craftsmen, such as\r\n\r\nthe Craft Diploma graduates of the Singapore\r\n\r\nVocational Institute. Already two such institutes\r\n\r\nare being built and more will be constructed in\r\n\r\nthe next few years. They are, in fact, the key\r\n\r\npersonnel in factories, and we are very short of\r\n\r\nthem. Lower down, we have the vocational schools\r\n\r\nwhich unfortunately are considered to be for the\r\n\r\n\"drop-outs\". We will rectify this. After leaving\r\n\r\nschool, these students will have a period of in-plant or industrial training to qualify as\r\n\r\noperatives specialising in one type of trade. The\r\n\r\ninstitutional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntraining in a vocational school provides a\r\n\r\ngeneral background education, while the in-plant\r\n\r\ntraining will be so orientated as to meet the\r\n\r\nrequirements of our industries from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to attract the best brains to\r\n\r\ntechnical education and industry, we must ensure\r\n\r\nthat there is a continuous ladder to the top for\r\n\r\nthose who are capable and those who want to go\r\n\r\ninto this stream. We must provide a parallel\r\n\r\noutlet to the present academic stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a new department created within the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education to plan, co-ordinate and\r\n\r\nadminister our technical education and industrial\r\n\r\ntraining at the sub-professional level. This\r\n\r\ndepartment will be supervised by a Cabinet\r\n\r\nCommittee, as outlined in the Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's Speech under the head Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are already being drawn up to launch a\r\n\r\ncrash programme for the training of craft teachers\r\n\r\nto man the new vocational institutes and training\r\n\r\ncentres which I have just mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Member for Serangoon Gardens\r\n\r\nthat the computer does not play a very important\r\n\r\npart in the selection of applicants. In case there\r\n\r\nis a large number of applicants, it comes in only\r\n\r\nin the grading of applicants and the preliminary\r\n\r\nshort-listing. All applicants will be interviewed\r\n\r\nas in the case of other teachers-in-training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-professional stream of the Polytechnic,\r\n\r\nthat is the technician course, will be enlarged,\r\n\r\nand there will be more vocational institutes. The\r\n\r\npresent vocational schools will be reorganised,\r\n\r\nconverted and their syllabuses modified. They will\r\n\r\nno longer be regarded as schools for drop-outs.\r\n\r\nIndustrial Training Centres will be established to\r\n\r\nprovide the in-plant training facilities to\r\n\r\ncomplement the institutional training. We hope\r\n\r\nthat by next year we will be able to see\r\n\r\nphysically the first of these changes, and by\r\n\r\n1971, we will have some 30,000 students in the\r\n\r\ntechnical and vocational streams. By then, the\r\n\r\nratio will be in the region of three and a half to\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are embarking on a very bold and\r\n\r\nambitious programme to develop our human\r\n\r\nresources. They are vital to our plans on\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and economic development and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, our very survival. We are confident\r\n\r\nthat we will succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhile perusing the memorandum presented to this\r\n\r\nHouse as an Addendum to the Speech by the\r\n\r\nPresident, I must say that it is physically\r\n\r\nimpossible for me to analyse all the salient\r\n\r\nfeatures in his policy speech. I can only touch on\r\n\r\ncertain problems which I feel should be tackled\r\n\r\nwith caution and understanding by the Government\r\n\r\nso that it will not fall or falter. It is my\r\n\r\nintention to speak on the proposed policies of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour on matters connected with\r\n\r\nfringe benefits, employer and employee relations\r\n\r\nand labour productivity with a view to promoting a\r\n\r\nbetter industrial climate essential for our\r\n\r\neconomic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the 51 Members in the last Parliament\r\n\r\nand 58 Members in the present Parliament\r\n\r\nrepresenting a cross-section of the people, I must\r\n\r\nconfess my bias for labour matters in the past.\r\n\r\nBut in the new context of our circumstances and\r\n\r\nthe gravity of our nation's problems, I feel that\r\n\r\none should speak without bias or prejudice on\r\n\r\nproblems connected with labour in this House.\r\n\r\nHence in the course of my speech, I hope to be\r\n\r\nable to drive home my views in meeting the call\r\n\r\nmade in the President's Speech for sensible\r\n\r\nrelations among employer, labour and management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is fast making a change from an\r\n\r\nentrepot economy to an industrialised State. In\r\n\r\nthis process, she has to make this island State\r\n\r\nsufficiently attractive both to indigenous and\r\n\r\nforeign capital. Singapore must keep the cost of\r\n\r\nproduction to the minimum so that her products can\r\n\r\nbe highly competitive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe also has an unemployment problem\r\n\r\nwith 10 to 15 per cent of the economically active\r\n\r\nunemployed. This figure can be expected to\r\n\r\nincrease with the complete withdrawal of the\r\n\r\nBritish Military Forces from Singapore by 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one in his right senses will say that\r\n\r\norganised labour is not aware of this glaring\r\n\r\ndifficulty. There is today an effective trade\r\n\r\nunion organisation which is capable of\r\n\r\ncomprehending fully the social and economic\r\n\r\nproblems of our nation. I am sure it will hasten\r\n\r\nto respond favourably to whatever measures the\r\n\r\nGovernment may propose to take to solve the\r\n\r\nnation's economic ills, provided such measures are\r\n\r\nreasonable and sincere, and labour interest is not\r\n\r\nunfairly jeopardised. Under the circumstances, I\r\n\r\nam sure the organised workers in Singapore will be\r\n\r\neager to know what new labour legislation the\r\n\r\nGovernment is going to introduce to regulate the\r\n\r\nterms and conditions of employment of all\r\n\r\nemployees. But before more detailed information is\r\n\r\navailable, it is unwise for me to comment on the\r\n\r\nmerit and demerit of this proposed Bill.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I have certain observations to make\r\n\r\non the aforementioned areas of fringe benefits,\r\n\r\nemployer/employee relations and labour\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the Government's intention to\r\n\r\neliminate fringe benefits which, they say, are\r\n\r\nlikely to be abused, may I caution the Government\r\n\r\nthat it must make a genuine attempt to distinguish\r\n\r\ncarefully between abusive and genuine fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits. Any attempt at indiscriminate slashing\r\n\r\nof fringe benefits will bring about much injustice\r\n\r\nto the workers and defeat the very purpose for\r\n\r\nwhich it was intended. Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare, as you know, in Singapore certain well-established firms whose profit margins are very\r\n\r\nhigh and where, as a result of labour efficiency\r\n\r\nand economies in production, they are likely to\r\n\r\nmove still further towards a better position.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, a reduction of fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits would be most unjustified and the union\r\n\r\nleadership would not be in a position\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto advise the workers concerned to accept the\r\n\r\nproposed terms. Further, labour productivity will\r\n\r\ndefinitely be adversely affected if such an\r\n\r\narbitrary measure is enforced by legislation,\r\n\r\nespecially when labour realises that there is no\r\n\r\nreward in putting additional efforts to improve\r\n\r\nthe financial position of the firms and\r\n\r\nindustries. This will lead only to unhappiness, a\r\n\r\nsense of social injustice and a feeling of\r\n\r\nexploitation, resulting in a deterioration or\r\n\r\nrupture of the existing good employer/employee\r\n\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must realise that there is a\r\n\r\npositive and a negative way to increase labour\r\n\r\nproductivity. The negative way is to tamper with\r\n\r\nthe existing fringe benefits, especially those\r\n\r\nwhich have been granted to the workers with the\r\n\r\nfull consent of the employers and the jurisdiction\r\n\r\nof the Arbitration Court. This approach is bound\r\n\r\nto boomerang on the Government. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nthe more desirable positive approach would be to\r\n\r\ngive labour a chance to show their capability for\r\n\r\nresponsibility. In this connection, I call for a\r\n\r\nmore decentralised approach to solving problems,\r\n\r\nand to persuading labour to exercise restraint. In\r\n\r\nthis way the Government will not be accused of\r\n\r\ninterfering with freely negotiated agreements\r\n\r\narrived at by mutual consent between the employees\r\n\r\nand the employers. In other words, instead of\r\n\r\nlegislation, the working groups of management and\r\n\r\nthe workers should be allowed to make on-the-spot\r\n\r\ndecisions with regard to a particular firm or\r\n\r\nindustry if conditions there warrant any\r\n\r\nmodification in the terms and conditions of\r\n\r\nservice. The Government should exhort management\r\n\r\nand labour to get together in a spirit of sincere\r\n\r\nco-operation to identify problem areas and tackle\r\n\r\nthem jointly. For example, management and labour\r\n\r\ncan be encouraged to co-operate in exploring ways\r\n\r\nfor more efficient utilisation of work force,\r\n\r\nincreasing the workers' efficiency through\r\n\r\nenlargement and improvement of job skills,\r\n\r\nelimination of unnecessary overtime and\r\n\r\nrestrictive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njob demarcations, and reorganisation of work\r\n\r\nmethods to reduce production costs. Certainly it\r\n\r\nis only through such positive measures that\r\n\r\npositive results can be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the issue of labour productivity in\r\n\r\nmore detail, it is also my contention that\r\n\r\nGovernment and management must not fall into the\r\n\r\nnasty habit of making labour the scapegoat for low\r\n\r\nproductivity and business failures. Increased\r\n\r\nproductivity is not something that labour alone\r\n\r\ncan achieve. If in a firm or industry there is low\r\n\r\nproductivity, it does not necessarily mean that\r\n\r\nlabour is at fault. It might be due to inefficient\r\n\r\nmanagement, especially when we have unqualified\r\n\r\nfamily management which used to employ their\r\n\r\nnieces and nephews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> And uncles!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> It might be due to other\r\n\r\nbottlenecks in the industry, wrong predictions\r\n\r\nmade by the entrepreneurs, excessive investments\r\n\r\non overheads, large inventories due to lack of\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the markets, absence of\r\n\r\nspecialised skill due to faulty training\r\n\r\nprogrammes of the industry and so on. These are\r\n\r\nall factors which might affect productivity, and\r\n\r\nit is rather naive to suggest that labour should\r\n\r\nbe held responsible for lower productivity. But\r\n\r\nsurprisingly enough, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been less vociferous in exhorting\r\n\r\nemployers to do their part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over and above all this, I\r\n\r\nconcur with my other trade union colleagues in\r\n\r\nrecognising the over-riding need for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consult with the trade unions before\r\n\r\npassing laws affecting the interests of the\r\n\r\nworkers. The best thing to do, I feel, is to set\r\n\r\nup a tripartite council of management, labour and\r\n\r\nGovernment representatives to discuss in detail\r\n\r\nthe Government's proposed Acts. Any arbitrary\r\n\r\nlegislation, or any attempt by the Government to\r\n\r\nbulldoze its way with the comprehensive Employment\r\n\r\nBill will result in a deterioration rather\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan an improvement in the industrial climate now\r\n\r\nexisting. The Government must not make the mistake\r\n\r\nby thinking that higher productivity can be\r\n\r\nacquired by merely passing Acts in this Parliament\r\n\r\nand choosing to ignore the opinions of labour\r\n\r\nrepresentatives. You can lead a horse to the\r\n\r\nwater. You can push its head into the water.

C. Hawkins, a member of the\r\n\r\nLondon Transport Executive. Even if the former\r\n\r\nLabour Front Government had wanted to implement\r\n\r\nthis proposal, it could not have done so because\r\n\r\nSingapore's reserves had been run down to such a\r\n\r\nlow level, and there was no second Christmas\r\n\r\nIsland to be sold to Australia to find the tens of\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars which would have been needed\r\n\r\nto nationalise the bus companies then operating in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the People's Action Party assumed the\r\n\r\ngovernment of Singapore in 1959, nationalisation\r\n\r\nof bus companies was not one of its platforms and\r\n\r\nrightly so, even to this day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the question of money alone which\r\n\r\ndeters us from opting for this solution. The whole\r\n\r\ntenor of the President's Speech gives a grim\r\n\r\npicture of the future which lies ahead of us, the\r\n\r\ngreat efforts and sacrifices demanded from every\r\n\r\none of the two million people of Singapore to gird\r\n\r\nthemselves to face the immense economic problems\r\n\r\nwhich we must overcome in order to survive. We\r\n\r\nwill be hard put to it to find the hundreds of\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars which will be needed to build\r\n\r\nup a credible defence force of our own by 1972,\r\n\r\nand the further hundreds of millions of dollars\r\n\r\nwhich will be needed for massive counter-recession\r\n\r\npublic works that have been and will continue to\r\n\r\nbe launched, as a set-off against the consequences\r\n\r\nof the accelerated British military pull-out by\r\n\r\n1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we have the funds available to\r\n\r\nnationalise the bus companies in Singapore, are we\r\n\r\nsure that we can provide a more efficient public\r\n\r\nservice after nationalisation? The experience of\r\n\r\nother countries has shown that bureaucracy will\r\n\r\nnot only worsen the situation but, worse still,\r\n\r\nmore losses will be sustained which will have to\r\n\r\nbe borne by Government.

It can and\r\n\r\nshould be improved, and this can be done within\r\n\r\nthe powers already contained in the various Acts\r\n\r\nor Ordinances at present in force. If these powers\r\n\r\nare not enough, I shall seek fresh powers through\r\n\r\nnew legislation. It will be my duty, during my\r\n\r\nterm of office as Minister for Communications, to\r\n\r\nmake a proper study of the transport problems\r\n\r\nfirst, and this takes some time. And when I am\r\n\r\nready, I will suggest ways and means for its\r\n\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware of many public complaints regarding\r\n\r\nthe inefficiency and poor service of our bus\r\n\r\ncompanies. The Member for Kallang has expressed to\r\n\r\nme verbally how dissatisfied he is with the\r\n\r\ninadequacy and inconvenience experienced by him as\r\n\r\na bus traveller, and I have promised to look into\r\n\r\nthe matter. The Member for Katong recently drew my\r\n\r\nattention to a complaint from his constituents\r\n\r\nregarding the curtailment of the Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction Company night bus service route 20-B,\r\n\r\nalong Tanjong Rhu. The explanation given by the\r\n\r\nS.T.C, was curious, that stoppage of the night\r\n\r\nservice was due to a \"misunderstanding between the\r\n\r\nManaging Director and Traffic Manager\"! However,\r\n\r\nthe night bus service along Tanjong Rhu, which\r\n\r\nstopped on 21st April. 1968, was resumed on 12th\r\n\r\nMay. 1968, after a written warning was issued to\r\n\r\nthe General Manager of the S.T.C, by my Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary, in his capacity as Chairman of the\r\n\r\nOmnibus Services Licensing Authority, drawing\r\n\r\nattention to the fact that bus companies can have\r\n\r\ntheir licences suspended or cancelled if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey fail to provide an adequate service on an\r\n\r\napproved route.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir, the decisions which\r\n\r\nI shall be making in the near future in an attempt\r\n\r\nto improve the public transport service in\r\n\r\nSingapore will be only short-term solutions. As\r\n\r\nfor long-term solutions of our transport problems,\r\n\r\nthis needs the attention of better qualified\r\n\r\nprofessional experts and planners. As stated in\r\n\r\nthe Addendum to the President's Speech, besides\r\n\r\nthe two senior officials from the London Transport\r\n\r\nBoard who have been invited under the Colombo Plan\r\n\r\nTechnical Co-operation Scheme \"to make a\r\n\r\npreliminary study of possible new measures to\r\n\r\nimprove and expand Singapore's mass transport\r\n\r\nfacilities\", there are at present a team of United\r\n\r\nNations advisers attached to our State and City\r\n\r\nPlanning Office \"to study the long-range aspects\r\n\r\nof providing a mass rapid transit system for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan next suggested that as\r\n\r\n\"pirate taxis\" are providing service to the public\r\n\r\nwhich the bus services are not able to cope with,\r\n\r\ntherefore such pirate taxis should he allowed to\r\n\r\noperate legally as \"express taxis\" and that pirate\r\n\r\ntaxi operators should, at most, be subject only to\r\n\r\na fine when caught and that their motor vehicles\r\n\r\nshould not be confiscated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the pirate-taxi problem came into\r\n\r\nbeing for two reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the growing problem of unemployment in\r\n\r\nSingapore so that those who do not wish to\r\n\r\ngo on the dole - that is, to seek Social\r\n\r\nWelfare assistance - turn to hawking or\r\n\r\nbecome pirate-taxi operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the inability of the bus companies to\r\n\r\nprovide an efficient, regular and adequate\r\n\r\nservice for bus travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the above two problems are resolved, the\r\n\r\npirate taxi problem will remain with us for some\r\n\r\ntime to come, as both the problems of unemployment\r\n\r\nand a better organised bus transport\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem will need considerable time and effort even\r\n\r\nto prevent the situation from worsening still\r\n\r\nfurther before attempting to resolve the problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What differentiates the pirate taxi operator from\r\n\r\nthe properly licensed taxi operator? At the\r\n\r\nmoment, the number of licensed taxis is limited to\r\n\r\n3,800. Licensed taxi-owners pay their share of\r\n\r\nroad tax to the Registrar of Vehicles. There is a\r\n\r\nlimitation on the number of passengers carried,\r\n\r\ndepending on the size of the motor vehicle. They\r\n\r\nare subject to a half-yearly mechanical inspection\r\n\r\nof the road-worthiness of the vehicle and they\r\n\r\nhave to pay a higher insurance premium to cover\r\n\r\nliability for passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the pirate-taxi operator only\r\n\r\npays the lower road tax applicable to private\r\n\r\ncars, but evades payment of at least $500 per\r\n\r\nannum which is the additional tax payable for a\r\n\r\nproper taxi if a diesel-driven vehicle, which is\r\n\r\nthe usual type used. They evade the half-yearly\r\n\r\nmechanical inspection of the road worthiness of\r\n\r\nthe vehicle and thus neglect proper maintenance of\r\n\r\nthe car to the peril of passengers and road users,\r\n\r\nand there is no effective insurance cover for\r\n\r\npassengers in case of an accident. In other words,\r\n\r\nthe pirate-taxi operator is an unscrupulous person\r\n\r\nwho seeks to earn his income through unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition with licensed taxis by shirking\r\n\r\npayment of his share of taxes and expenses of more\r\n\r\nthan $1,000 per annum. It is akin to the nefarious\r\n\r\nactivities of smuggling, for high profits\r\n\r\nobtainable through evasion and non-payment of\r\n\r\ncustoms or excise duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To suggest legalisation of pirate taxis is\r\n\r\nequivalent to suggesting legalisation of smuggling\r\n\r\nactivities! If we want law and order to prevail, I\r\n\r\nam afraid we have no alternative but to take firm\r\n\r\naction against the activities of pirate taxis.\r\n\r\nBecause of them, the earnings of licensed taxis\r\n\r\nand of bus companies have been affected.

Difficulties and problems\r\n\r\nwill arise by the end of 1971 when the British\r\n\r\nfinally withdraw all their armed forces. However,\r\n\r\nplans have been made and will be carried out. In\r\n\r\nfact, some of the plans have already been\r\n\r\nimplemented to overcome the problems and\r\n\r\ndifficulties to be faced. These are based on three\r\n\r\nmain objectives. The first objective is to ensure\r\n\r\nthe security o, the Republic. To achieve this, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has taken positive steps to build up an\r\n\r\neffective defence capability at minimum cost by\r\n\r\nmobilising our youth in the National Defence\r\n\r\nForces. Every citizen between the ages of 18 and\r\n\r\n21 is mobilised for part-time and full-time\r\n\r\nservice in the National Defence Forces. I fully\r\n\r\nsupport this scheme which has already been carried\r\n\r\nout. Not only is this a practical scheme that\r\n\r\nensures the security of the Republic, but by this\r\n\r\nmeans the Government is also able to cut down\r\n\r\nexpenditure for economic development and progress\r\n\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my fellow workers and I will\r\n\r\nsurely support the second objective of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, which is to effect greater economic\r\n\r\ngrowth, higher productivity with the elimination\r\n\r\nof restrictive practices, more efficient\r\n\r\nmanagement, and to limit fringe benefits, Indeed\r\n\r\nthis objective will be of benefit to the employers\r\n\r\nif it will provide more jobs and the workers'\r\n\r\ninterests can also be safeguarded; that is to say,\r\n\r\nif all three parties - the employers, the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the workers can benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to carry out the objective, it\r\n\r\nwould appear that it is the workers who will\r\n\r\nsuffer in consequence, and their day-to-day\r\n\r\nlivelihood will be affected, for in the memorandum\r\n\r\npresented to Parliament as an Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's Speech, it is stated that a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive Employment Bill will be introduced\r\n\r\nto standardise a working week of 44 hours for all\r\n\r\nemployees, to regulate overtime work and to limit\r\n\r\ncertain fringe benefits. This should be carefully\r\n\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have stated earlier, my\r\n\r\nfellow workers and I will surely give our\r\n\r\nwholehearted support to the scheme if it will\r\n\r\ntruly benefit all the three parties concerned. But\r\n\r\nwhat is feared is that this much awaited\r\n\r\nopportunity will be seized upon by the employers\r\n\r\nto exploit the workers by taking away all their\r\n\r\nfringe benefits. The benefits which have been\r\n\r\nenjoyed by the workers are a 39-hour week for non-industrial workers, a 44-hour week for industrial\r\n\r\nworkers, annual leave of at least two weeks for\r\n\r\nworkers under the Clerks Employment Ordinance, and\r\n\r\nat least one week for workers under the Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 16 public holidays for clerks and 11\r\n\r\ndays for labourers, and other fringe benefits. So\r\n\r\nfor every nine non-industrial workers working 44\r\n\r\nhours a week instead of 39 hours a week, one\r\n\r\nperson will be redundant. Similarly, annual leave,\r\n\r\npublic holidays and other fringe benefits will be\r\n\r\naffected. This means that the scheme is not going\r\n\r\nto provide more jobs to lessen the number of those\r\n\r\nalready unemployed as a result of retrenchment on\r\n\r\naccount of redundancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another scheme of the Government, the effect of\r\n\r\nwhich will be keenly felt by the workers, is with\r\n\r\nregard to contributions to the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund for all employees to enable them to buy\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board flats. This is an\r\n\r\nexcellent scheme and I support it a hundred per\r\n\r\ncent, as employees will be able to buy Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats from their contributions.\r\n\r\nHowever, we must also think of the pay they take\r\n\r\nhome every month which will be that much less by\r\n\r\nthe amount of the contribution. This means that\r\n\r\nthey will have less money for their day-to-day\r\n\r\nexpenses; even with their present earnings, they\r\n\r\ncan hardly keep pace with the rising cost of daily\r\n\r\nnecessities which can be seen in the Monthly\r\n\r\nDigest 01 Statistics. I quote from Volume VII, No.\r\n\r\n4 of April 1968:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n            Siam polishd rice 100 per cent \r\n\r\n                 - 42 cents per katty in January 1967.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n            Siam polished rice 100 per cent \r\n\r\n                 - 50 cents per katty in January 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Siam polished rice, five per cent broken \r\n\r\n                 - 39 cents per katty in January 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Siam polished rice, five per cent broken \r\n\r\n                 - 47 cents per katty in January 1968.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other items such as -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> What about wheat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

But the wife and\r\n\r\nchildren and other dependants of workers in need\r\n\r\nof hospital or outpatient treatment will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurely be made to pay the charges according to the\r\n\r\nnew scheme, and this will mean that the workers\r\n\r\nagain will suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my capacity as a trade union leader and\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the residents of Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan, I very often receive accounts of the\r\n\r\nhardships experienced by them, for in Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan and the areas around, such as Kampong\r\n\r\nUbi and others, 90 per cent of the residents are\r\n\r\nworkers or wage-earners and they live in under-developed areas. The drains are choked with\r\n\r\novergrown grass and stagnant water. The Government\r\n\r\nhas not paid much attention to clearing the grass\r\n\r\nfrom the drains so that the water will drain off\r\n\r\nand mosquitoes will not breed. Rubbish is not\r\n\r\nproperly removed, thereby causing flies to breed.\r\n\r\nThese are sources of ill-health and sickness. That\r\n\r\nis why I believe that the Government Outpatient\r\n\r\nClinic at Still Road is the best patronised of\r\n\r\nGovernment clinics because of the lack of health\r\n\r\nservice amenities in the area! At this point, I\r\n\r\nwould ask the Ministry of Health to furnish this\r\n\r\nHouse with the number of patients treated at every\r\n\r\noutpatient clinic throughout the Republic for the\r\n\r\nperiod 1st January, 1968, to 30th April, 1968, so\r\n\r\nthat we will be able to study the problem and know\r\n\r\nwhich constituencies have many patients attending\r\n\r\nthe clinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I trust that the Government, in\r\n\r\ndrawing up the new Employment Bill and planning to\r\n\r\nincrease hospital and out-patient charges and to\r\n\r\nimpose other taxes, will not adversely affect the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of workers with small incomes. The\r\n\r\nGovernment should have prior consultations with\r\n\r\nthe national trade union movement in Singapore and\r\n\r\ndiscussions with the National Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress, and I hope that their suggestions and\r\n\r\nviews will not be cold-shouldered by Government.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I believe that those workers who\r\n\r\nare members of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions led by non-Communist leaders are patriotic,\r\n\r\nhave a strong sense of national consciousness, can\r\n\r\nadjust themselves in the national interest and are\r\n\r\nwilling to place national interest above personal\r\n\r\nor group interest. This can be seen from their\r\n\r\nresponse to the Government's call to build a\r\n\r\nstrong and rugged society. A good number of our\r\n\r\nworkers have received training at the Youth\r\n\r\nTraining Centre at Buona Vista Road and many of\r\n\r\nthem have given a day's pay in response to the\r\n\r\ncall for contributions to the National Defence\r\n\r\nFund. Some have sacrificed one day's pay for work\r\n\r\ndone on a public holiday. My own union, the\r\n\r\nSingapore Telephone Board Employees' Union, will\r\n\r\nbe donating a day's pay, and the Race Course\r\n\r\nWorkers' Union will be donating a day's pay for\r\n\r\nwork done on a public holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I support the Address moved 'by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to thank the President for his speech in\r\n\r\nthe House. The Minister for Communications has\r\n\r\nstated that the Member for Jalan Besar took pains\r\n\r\nto get donations from taxi-drivers to the Defence\r\n\r\nFund. But apparently other hon. Members,\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries, Ministers of State and\r\n\r\nMinisters have not contributed. So I suggest that\r\n\r\nthey contribute a day's pay to the National\r\n\r\nDefence Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I touch on some of the\r\n\r\npoints brought up by Members of the House, let me\r\n\r\nrestate the salient points on educational policy\r\n\r\nin the President's Speech to Parliament. These are\r\n\r\n(a) more secondary students are to be diverted to\r\n\r\ntechnical and vocational education; (b) a\r\n\r\nconcerted effort to be made to produce bilingual\r\n\r\nschool-leavers; (c) more attention is to be paid\r\n\r\nto quality in education at all levels; and (d)\r\n\r\nintegration of schools is to be extended to aided\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we propose to achieve these targets? At\r\n\r\nthis stage, I can only tell the House what we have\r\n\r\nalready done so far which is consonant with the declared \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobjectives. What we propose to do\r\n\r\nspecifically to attain the objectives will need\r\n\r\ncareful thinking and refining before\r\n\r\nimplementation. The machinery to bring about the\r\n\r\nswing towards technical and vocational education\r\n\r\nhas already been set in motion. The Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee has already held its second meeting. The\r\n\r\nbeginnings of a separate administrative unit have\r\n\r\nbeen identified and an executive director has been\r\n\r\nappointed. Eventually the executive arm of the\r\n\r\ncouncil will have its own offices, its own staff\r\n\r\nand its own budget. It will take over all\r\n\r\ntechnical and vocational schools, vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes and co-ordinate technical courses at\r\n\r\nNgee Ann College and the Polytechnic below degree\r\n\r\nor professional diploma level. It will reorganise\r\n\r\nthe curricula in technical and vocational schools\r\n\r\nto lay more emphasis on practical training. It\r\n\r\nwill create new types of training establishments\r\n\r\nfor those who have left formal schooling and link\r\n\r\nthem up with existing training schemes such as the\r\n\r\ndockyard training scheme of the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority. In short, the Council will formulate\r\n\r\nthe policy, implement the decisions and co-ordinate the activities of all forms of technical\r\n\r\neducation and vocational training both within and\r\n\r\noutside the formal school system at all levels\r\n\r\nbelow tertiary institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target of making all school-leavers bilingual\r\n\r\nis not a new one. But it is in the approach\r\n\r\ntowards this objective that we hope to break new\r\n\r\nground. Way back in 1965 we announced that a\r\n\r\nsecond language would be made compulsory in the\r\n\r\nsecondary schools. Next year the first batch of\r\n\r\nSchool Certificate students affected by this\r\n\r\ndecision will be sitting for compulsory second\r\n\r\nlanguage papers. These papers are compulsory in\r\n\r\nthe sense that candidates must sit for them. They\r\n\r\nare not compulsory in the sense that a pass in the\r\n\r\nsecond language is a \"must\" for passing the School\r\n\r\nCertificate Examination as a whole. The rationale\r\n\r\nbehind our desire for bilingualism is really quite\r\n\r\nsimple. We are a small nation of only two million\r\n\r\npeople but we have no less than four official\r\n\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously we cannot make everybody quadrilingual.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we are to remain\r\n\r\nmonolingual, we shall not be able to make\r\n\r\nourselves understood to one another, let alone\r\n\r\nbuild a nation together. Bilingualism is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, not only a compromise but also a matter\r\n\r\nof survival. What have we done for bilingualism so\r\n\r\nfar? I would say quite a lot, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbut much of it is unpublicised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years past we have been sending teachers\r\n\r\nabroad to undergo specialised training in the\r\n\r\nteaching of English as a second language. They\r\n\r\nhave come back to pass on their expertise to other\r\n\r\nteachers. Together with two British experts they\r\n\r\nhave been conducting in-service courses for all\r\n\r\nteachers of English in non-English schools. This\r\n\r\nexercise is now coming to an end, but fresh\r\n\r\ncourses will soon be organised for other teachers\r\n\r\nwho want to specialise in the teaching of English\r\n\r\nas a second language so that a relief pool of such\r\n\r\nspecialist teachers can be built up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education\r\n\r\nCouncil's Regional English Language Centre, an\r\n\r\ninteresting experiment is currently being\r\n\r\nconducted to test the effectiveness of a new\r\n\r\nlanguage teaching technique involving the use of\r\n\r\nsophisticated teaching machines. Our Educational\r\n\r\nTelevision Service is diverting much more of its\r\n\r\nlimited resources to the teaching of English both\r\n\r\nas a first and as a second language. If only the\r\n\r\nplanned expansion of the E.T.V, service were\r\n\r\nallowed to proceed, much more could be done. Our\r\n\r\nsyllabus for English as a second language is being\r\n\r\nover-hauled. Revision of the primary syllabus has\r\n\r\nbeen completed and revision of the secondary\r\n\r\nsyllabus is in progress. We have also experimented\r\n\r\nwith the teaching of Mathematics using English as\r\n\r\nthe medium of instruction in some non-English\r\n\r\nprimary schools, and the results of the experiment\r\n\r\nare encouraging. This is a new departure on which\r\n\r\nwe place our hope for the future. Our belief is\r\n\r\nthat fluency in the second language will improve\r\n\r\nif it is used as a language of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstruction for certain subjects in addition to\r\n\r\nits being taught as a second language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about Chinese as a second language? Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the results so far have been\r\n\r\ndisappointing owing to historical reasons. It must\r\n\r\nbe remembered that Chinese as a second language\r\n\r\nwas introduced within comparatively recent times.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the teaching of Chinese as a second\r\n\r\nlanguage is a subject in which we have no\r\n\r\nspecially trained teachers. There are experts who\r\n\r\nvery successfully teach Chinese as a foreign\r\n\r\nlanguage to people whose native tongue is not\r\n\r\nChinese. But there are no known experts who teach\r\n\r\nChinese to Chinese pupils whose first language is\r\n\r\nEnglish. This is not to say that we have done\r\n\r\nnothing about it. An eminent teacher of Chinese as\r\n\r\na foreign language was invited to Singapore last\r\n\r\nyear to study the problem. Arising from his report\r\n\r\nwe hope to invite other experts to make a fuller\r\n\r\nstudy and to tackle the problem in a systematic\r\n\r\nand scientific way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our observations it would seem that the\r\n\r\nolder generation of bilingual people have\r\n\r\ninvariably started their education in their mother\r\n\r\ntongue and then switched over to English at a\r\n\r\nlater stage. For example, all the Malay officers\r\n\r\nin my Ministry who are bilingual went to Malay\r\n\r\nprimary schools and then switched over to English\r\n\r\nsecondary schools after a conversion year of\r\n\r\nintensive English. This was because in those days\r\n\r\nthere was no secondary education in the Malay\r\n\r\nmedium. But now that we have established secondary\r\n\r\neducation in the Malay medium, we seem to be less\r\n\r\nsuccessful in producing Malay school leavers who\r\n\r\nare bilingual in Malay and English. Similarly, the\r\n\r\nChinese officers in my Ministry who are bilingual\r\n\r\nwent through a similar transition; in this case\r\n\r\nnot for lack of secondary education in the Chinese\r\n\r\nmedium but by free choice. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nthose pupils who begin their education in English\r\n\r\nhave found it much more difficult to learn their\r\n\r\nmother tongue as a second language even though\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey are taught that language from Primary I\r\n\r\nonwards. If there is any truth in this\r\n\r\nobservation, the way to bilingualism would seem to\r\n\r\nlie in beginning formal education in the mother\r\n\r\ntongue for a few years, then switching to English\r\n\r\nas the medium of instruction whilst retaining the\r\n\r\nmother tongue as a second language. To achieve\r\n\r\nquality in education the first prerequisite is\r\n\r\nbetter teachers. Better teachers require better\r\n\r\nteacher training, and better teacher training\r\n\r\nmeans, amongst other things, full-time teacher\r\n\r\ntraining. Two years ago, we made the first\r\n\r\ntentative reversion to full-time training and the\r\n\r\nfirst batch of teachers so trained have just\r\n\r\npassed out from the Teachers' Training College.\r\n\r\nMore and more of such teachers will be trained in\r\n\r\nthe years to come while the number of part-time\r\n\r\ntrainees will be reduced correspondingly. In two\r\n\r\nor three years' time, we shall not be recruiting\r\n\r\npart-time trainees at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, quality in education demands better\r\n\r\nfacilities. In the provision of school buildings,\r\n\r\nplaying fields, sports and other equipment, we in\r\n\r\nSingapore are second to none in Asia.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have still to use our schools\r\n\r\nfor two shifts. A gradual reversion to single-session schools will be made, but because of the\r\n\r\nscarcity of land, only a limited number of\r\n\r\nsecondary schools will in the end enjoy this\r\n\r\nprivilege. Here we propose to begin at the top\r\n\r\nwith the pre-university classes. The first junior\r\n\r\ncollege at Linden Drive catering exclusively for\r\n\r\npre-university students will open in January next\r\n\r\nyear. It will be a single-session college with\r\n\r\nmany more facilities than are available at present\r\n\r\nto pre-university students in schools. Although\r\n\r\nthe existing pre-university students attend school\r\n\r\nonly in the morning, they have to vacate their\r\n\r\nclassrooms at 1.00 p.m, for other students in the\r\n\r\nlower forms of the afternoon session, and they do\r\n\r\nnot have exclusive use of the playing field and\r\n\r\nother facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the opening of the first junior college,\r\n\r\npre-university education in Singapore will enter a new \r\n\r\nphase and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents will enjoy a corporate life much more\r\n\r\nakin to that of a university. Research of the\r\n\r\nright kind will also help us achieve quality\r\n\r\nmainly by eliminating waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong has suggested that we\r\n\r\nshould set up an independent research unit. I\r\n\r\nwould have thought that the University of\r\n\r\nSingapore would have been the ideal place for\r\n\r\neducation research. But apparently nothing much\r\n\r\nhas been done there apart from dissertations by\r\n\r\nstudents for their Master's degree in Education.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of leadership in educational\r\n\r\nresearch from the obvious quarter, my Ministry has\r\n\r\nhad to set up its own modest research and\r\n\r\nstatistics department. This department has been in\r\n\r\nexistence for barely a year and some of its\r\n\r\nestablished posts have yet to be filled.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it has already completed three small\r\n\r\nprojects: a survey of educational wastage in\r\n\r\nSingapore in the past two years, a study of the\r\n\r\ncorrelation of the performance of 200 pupils in\r\n\r\nthe 1960 Primary School Leaving Examination and\r\n\r\ntheir performance in the 1964 School Certificate\r\n\r\nExamination, a survey of the teaching of\r\n\r\nMathematics using English as the medium of\r\n\r\ninstruction in Government Chinese Primary I and\r\n\r\nPrimary II classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Teachers' Training College too, there has\r\n\r\nbeen a revival of research activity. During the\r\n\r\npast year, two modest projects were completed. One\r\n\r\nis a study of the motives for choosing teaching as\r\n\r\na career published under the title of Why Teach,\r\n\r\nand the other is a study of the trainee teacher's\r\n\r\nattitude towards supervision of classroom teaching\r\n\r\nwhich will be published soon. A number of other\r\n\r\nresearch projects are either in progress or at the\r\n\r\nplanning stage in both the Teachers' Training\r\n\r\nCollege and the Ministry's department of research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we come to the fourth and last objective\r\n\r\n- that of extending integration to the aided\r\n\r\nschools. Here, we have formulated no hard and fast\r\n\r\nrule. The initiative for integration should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome from the aided schools themselves. But\r\n\r\nclearly there is need for something to be done\r\n\r\nsoon. As of last year, there were 87 integrated\r\n\r\nschools, all of them Government schools with a\r\n\r\ntotal enrolment of over 130,000. To date, there is\r\n\r\nnot a single integrated aided school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me next turn to some of the\r\n\r\nsuggestions made by Members of this House. One\r\n\r\nMember suggested that the Primary School Leaving\r\n\r\nExamination be abolished and a new examination be\r\n\r\ninstituted at Secondary II level. Another Member\r\n\r\nsuggested that channelling of students into the\r\n\r\ntechnical, vocational and academic streams should\r\n\r\nbe done at the Secondary II level rather than\r\n\r\nafter Primary 6. These two suggestions which are\r\n\r\ninter-related are professionally sound. As a\r\n\r\nmatter of fact, the very same proposals were\r\n\r\nincorporated in a paper on educational policy\r\n\r\nsubmitted by my Ministry to the Government some\r\n\r\nyears ago. The difficulty in accepting such a\r\n\r\nproposition is that it would mean automatic\r\n\r\npromotion to the secondary school for all. And\r\n\r\ntaking into account two chances of repeat between\r\n\r\nPrimary I and Secondary II and two more years of\r\n\r\nsecondary schooling after Secondary II in one form\r\n\r\nor another, we would have to provide in excess of\r\n\r\n10 years of education for a great number of\r\n\r\npupils. This was something we could not afford\r\n\r\neven in the days when there was no need to build\r\n\r\nup a defence capability. However, I am firmly of\r\n\r\nthe view, which is backed by professional officers\r\n\r\nof my Ministry, that every child should have eight\r\n\r\nyears of general education before he is channelled\r\n\r\ninto technical, vocational or academic education.\r\n\r\nWe are of this view, firstly, because 14 years is\r\n\r\nconsidered the minimum age at which a child is\r\n\r\nmature enough to begin specialisation. And,\r\n\r\nsecondly, because eight years is considered the\r\n\r\nminimum period necessary for acquiring the basic\r\n\r\nlanguage and mathematical skills with which to\r\n\r\nlearn other specialised skills. With eight years\r\n\r\nof general education, a child of average\r\n\r\nintelligence will, in fact, have reached the\r\n\r\nSecondary II level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For others with less than average intelligence,\r\n\r\nthey may have reached only Primary 6 or Secondary\r\n\r\nI level. There is, therefore, a fundamental\r\n\r\ndifference between channelling at Secondary II and\r\n\r\nchannelling after eight years of general\r\n\r\neducation. That eight years of general education\r\n\r\nbefore specialisation is desirable is\r\n\r\nindisputable. But the question is whether we can\r\n\r\nafford even this more modest proposal as a result\r\n\r\nof the build-up in defence. The decision does not\r\n\r\nrest with my Ministry or the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\nIt rests with the Government and it can only be\r\n\r\nmade after very careful weighing of our\r\n\r\npriorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say a few words for the\r\n\r\nbenefit of those who are impatient for change.\r\n\r\nThere is no advantage in change for change's sake.\r\n\r\nIn education above all else, we must move with\r\n\r\nprudence and w it h caution, especially in a small\r\n\r\nmulti-racial and multi-lingual nation whose\r\n\r\neconomy and whose survival depends on stability.\r\n\r\nLet us not forget the trials and tribulations that\r\n\r\nwe have undergone as a result of educational\r\n\r\nreform in the not too distant past. Let us look\r\n\r\nbeyond our shores to nations with much older\r\n\r\neducational systems and see for ourselves the\r\n\r\ntroubles that they are undergoing right now. Let\r\n\r\nus remember that with over a quarter of our entire\r\n\r\npopulation in school, any change that we make will\r\n\r\naffect every man, woman and child in our Republic\r\n\r\ndirectly or indirectly. Let us remember too that\r\n\r\nany experiment we perform in education has to use\r\n\r\nchildren for guinea pigs and any mistake we make\r\n\r\nnow will show up only in the next generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, let me join hon. Members in thanking the\r\n\r\nPresident for delivering his speech in which he\r\n\r\nhas outlined the three objectives that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will seek to achieve in the crucial\r\n\r\nyears ahead. The workers of Singapore recognise\r\n\r\nthe need for the attainment of these objectives,\r\n\r\nnamely, (1) effective defence capability; (2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreater economic growth; and (3) enhancement of\r\n\r\nnational consciousness. As outlined by the\r\n\r\nPresident, the crucial problems are unusual in\r\n\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organised workers of Singapore, as led by the\r\n\r\nNational Trades Union Congress, are not only\r\n\r\nconscious of but also concerned with the problems\r\n\r\nthat our Republic has to face in the difficult\r\n\r\nyears ahead. Recognising this crisis that we have\r\n\r\nto face and realising that everyone in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill have to make sacrifices to achieve economic\r\n\r\nsuccess for Singapore, the National Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress Delegates' Conference on 7th April, 1968.\r\n\r\npassed a special resolution giving the Government\r\n\r\nits co-operation and support in the initiation and\r\n\r\nformulation of emergency measures that may be\r\n\r\ndeemed necessary. The President too has indicated\r\n\r\nthat sacrifice and greater effort is needed as we\r\n\r\nface an emergency situation. I wholeheartedly\r\n\r\nagree that emergency measures are necessary when\r\n\r\nwe are faced with grave problems of economic\r\n\r\nadjustment of a temporary nature. We are confident\r\n\r\nthat the crisis we face is of a temporary nature\r\n\r\nand that this Government is capable of solving the\r\n\r\nproblems by 1971. Unfortunately, we have the\r\n\r\nbitter experience in this part of the world that\r\n\r\nsometimes emergency legislation passed somehow or\r\n\r\nother becomes permanent even after the end of the\r\n\r\nemergency. I sincerely hope that the emergency\r\n\r\nlabour legislation that is to be moved in\r\n\r\nParliament will not become permanent even after\r\n\r\nthe crisis is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the special resolution passed by\r\n\r\nthe delegates of the National Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress, the workers of Singapore are willing to\r\n\r\nmake sacrifices, but are not willing to commit\r\n\r\nsuicide. The trust and the faith the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore have placed on the People's Action Party\r\n\r\nGovernment in electing all the 58 Members of\r\n\r\nParliament shows that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nexpect us to solve the problems that we face by\r\n\r\n1971. For the survival of Singapore, solve them we\r\n\r\nmust. The workers of Singapore are willing to\r\n\r\ntighten up their belts by two inches or, if\r\n\r\nnecessary, even three inches in order to overcome\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntemporary setbacks. But if we expect them to\r\n\r\nremove their belts from their waists and hang\r\n\r\nthemselves, they will never do it. They recognise\r\n\r\nthat the Government is pro-labour in its outlook\r\n\r\nand it is our duty to see that this recognition is\r\n\r\nmaintained. Co-operation between labour and the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not been lacking so far, although\r\n\r\nin a number of issues disagreements have been\r\n\r\nrecorded. The workers of Singapore have fully co-operated with the Government in the national and\r\n\r\nwider interests of the country. Similarly, we\r\n\r\nexpect the Government's co-operation and\r\n\r\nconsultation with the labour movement in Singapore\r\n\r\nwhen contemplating labour legislation. During this\r\n\r\nperiod of consultation, I hope the\r\n\r\nrepresentations, proposals or amendments as\r\n\r\nproposed by the National Trades Union Congress to\r\n\r\nthe Bill will be accepted by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not disillusion the workers.\r\n\r\nDisillusionment will lead to frustration and we do\r\n\r\nnot want a labour situation like the one that\r\n\r\nexisted in Singapore in the late 1950s and early\r\n\r\n1960s. Let us not forget that the Communist-led\r\n\r\ntrade unions are still around the corner waiting\r\n\r\nto exploit any feeling of frustration amongst the\r\n\r\nworkers. Let us also remember that trained\r\n\r\nCommunist cadres are watching from the sidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall comment further on various aspects of the\r\n\r\nBill, when it is introduced in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As set out in the President's Speech, the Bill\r\n\r\nwill seek to provide a standard working week of 44\r\n\r\nhours for all employees. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nsaid, that this will standardise and regulate the\r\n\r\nterms and conditions of employment for workmen,\r\n\r\nclerks and shop assistants. We now have about\r\n\r\n137,000 workmen and industrial clerks who work 44\r\n\r\nhours a week. We also have about 28,500 shop\r\n\r\nassistants who also work 44 hours a week. In other\r\n\r\nwords, we have about 165,500 registered workers\r\n\r\nwho work 44 hours a week and only about 33,500\r\n\r\nclerks who work 39 hours a week. Therefore, what\r\n\r\nthe legislation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill bring about is that these 33,500 clerks will\r\n\r\nbe required to do an additional 5 hours per week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As set out in the Addendum to the President's\r\n\r\nSpeech, this new legislation also seeks to\r\n\r\nregulate overtime and to enable a wider spread of\r\n\r\nemployment. Sir, this legislation will certainly\r\n\r\ncurtail the overtime of clerks, but will it spread\r\n\r\nemployment? As a result of the increased hours of\r\n\r\nwork, will it result in retrenchment? Will there\r\n\r\nbe safeguards for employees so that they will not\r\n\r\nlose their jobs as a result of increased working\r\n\r\nhours? These are questions that will have to be\r\n\r\ncarefully considered and the drafting of the Bill\r\n\r\ncan best be done with close consultation with the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions in Singapore look forward to the day\r\n\r\nof full employment. They realise that there is\r\n\r\nlarge-scale unemployment in Singapore, and unless\r\n\r\nand until everybody is employed, labour will be\r\n\r\nexploited. Will this legislation that is to be\r\n\r\nintroduced be used by employers to exploit their\r\n\r\nemployees? Will the increase in hours of work for\r\n\r\nclerks remove the social differences that the blue-collar workers feel exist between them and the\r\n\r\nwhite-collar workers? By increasing the working\r\n\r\nhours of clerks from 39 hours to 44 hours a week,\r\n\r\nwe are not showing that the blue-collar workers\r\n\r\nare as good as, if not better than, the white-collar workers. We are just showing that the\r\n\r\nclerks are just as bad as the blue-collar workers.\r\n\r\nLet us remember that not all employers in\r\n\r\nSingapore are angels. There will be many who will\r\n\r\nutilise this legislation to exploit workers for\r\n\r\ntheir own benefit. On Friday, we heard the Member\r\n\r\nfor River Valley pay a glowing tribute to the\r\n\r\nworkers of Singapore. Speaking as an employer, he\r\n\r\npraised the workers of Singapore and assured that\r\n\r\nthe employers will not exploit this piece of\r\n\r\nlegislation. But Sir, not all employers are as\r\n\r\nenlightened as the Member for River Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also aware that there are employers\r\n\r\nin Singapore who prefer to give overtime\r\n\r\nemployment rather than employ new employees. How\r\n\r\nare we going to curb them? The Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nwill have to consider all these questions very\r\n\r\ncarefully before the Bill is introduced in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also point out now that the N.T.U.C, is\r\n\r\nfully committed to increasing productivity and has\r\n\r\ndone and is doing all it can to increase\r\n\r\nproductivity. The National Productivity Centre at\r\n\r\nJurong was set up by the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard principally through the motivating power of\r\n\r\nthe N.T.U.C. The N.T.U.C, propagates and advances\r\n\r\nthe view amongst its members and the Government\r\n\r\nthat increased productivity is something to strive\r\n\r\nfor. It also seeks ways to inculcate in workers\r\n\r\nthat mass productivity means progressive\r\n\r\nimprovement in the conditions of labour. Increased\r\n\r\nhours of work alone will not result in increased\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the move by the\r\n\r\nGovernment to include employees of Government,\r\n\r\nstatutory boards and self-employed persons as\r\n\r\ncontributors to the Central Provident Fund, in\r\n\r\naddition to pensions or other provident fund\r\n\r\nbenefits. This will go a long way towards\r\n\r\ncompulsory savings and increasing the funds for\r\n\r\nindustrial financing by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home ownership scheme to be introduced will\r\n\r\nencourage and induce more construction not only of\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats but also private building\r\n\r\nconstruction. However, it is noted in the Addendum\r\n\r\nto the President's Speech that the scheme being\r\n\r\nworked out between the Ministry of Labour and the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board will only enable\r\n\r\nbalances in the present Central Provident Fund to\r\n\r\nbe set off against the first instalment of Housing\r\n\r\nBoard fiats. However, the Central Provident Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions can be used to pay off monthly\r\n\r\ninstalments for both Housing Board flats and\r\n\r\nprivately built homes. The Government should also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider whether the present Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund contributors can use their present balance as\r\n\r\na first instalment for privately built homes as\r\n\r\nwell, instead of confining them to Housing Board\r\n\r\nflats. I welcome another excellent feature that is\r\n\r\ncontemplated, that is, the lowering of the\r\n\r\nassessment in the home-ownership scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the head Ministry of Education, I\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly agree with the comments made by the\r\n\r\nMembers for Katong, Serangoon Gardens, Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nand Bukit Panjang, notwithstanding the answer\r\n\r\ngiven by the Minister for Education. I am pleased\r\n\r\nto note that a few well established secondary\r\n\r\nschools will be converted to single-session\r\n\r\nschools. Now that the quantitative target has been\r\n\r\nachieved, we should also think in terms of not\r\n\r\nonly converting more schools to single-session\r\n\r\nschools but also reducing the number of classrooms\r\n\r\nin each school. It is to be noted that schools in\r\n\r\nthe last few years have become immense factories\r\n\r\nwhere, in some instances, the staff is so very\r\n\r\nlarge that the principal, who has to be a\r\n\r\nprofessional guide to the teachers, is not even\r\n\r\nable to know all the teachers by their names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1950s, we had schools with not more than\r\n\r\n13 classes in each session. They were managed by\r\n\r\ntwo principals, one in the morning and one in the\r\n\r\nafternoon. Today, we have schools with 30 to 40\r\n\r\nclassrooms in each session. They are managed by\r\n\r\none principal who is expected to supervise the\r\n\r\nteachers and students of both sessions, which is\r\n\r\nhumanly impossible. Now that we have reached the\r\n\r\nstage of qualitative education, although we may\r\n\r\nnot be able to have one session in every school,\r\n\r\nwe should make a start by at least appointing one\r\n\r\nprincipal for one session, which will improve the\r\n\r\nsituation somewhat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

All\r\n\r\nsensible  people will take this warning seriously.\r\n\r\nWith  the British withdrawal, we will not only  be\r\n\r\nlosing  a  major source of income, but  will  also\r\n\r\nhave  to  meet heavy expenditure to  build  up  an\r\n\r\nadequate  defence  force within  a  short  period.\r\n\r\nThese are no small problems and it will be foolish\r\n\r\nto  pretend  that they are. Some of the  steps  to\r\n\r\novercome these difficulties are explained in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Addendum to the President's Speech and in the\r\n\r\nMinisterial  statements. These will  minimise  the\r\n\r\neffects of the British withdrawal, but it will  be\r\n\r\ntoo  much to hope that the normal standard of life\r\n\r\nto  which  we  are accustomed will be  unaffected.\r\n\r\nWith the loss of a major source of income and  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure of a large portion of our resources on\r\n\r\ndefence,   there  will  be  less   available   for\r\n\r\nconsumption. We must therefore be prepared  for  a\r\n\r\nmore  Spartan life during the transitional  period\r\n\r\nof  the  next five or ten years until our  economy\r\n\r\nhas stabilised under new conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adapting ourselves to new conditions may not be\r\n\r\neasy. Giving up luxuries which we used to take for\r\n\r\ngranted  may not be pleasant, but they  are  small\r\n\r\nsacrifices for a better and more secure future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has shown us that whether a nation will\r\n\r\nprosper or perish depends on its ability to change\r\n\r\nand  adapt. Even great nations had floundered  and\r\n\r\ngone  into oblivion for clinging to old ways  that\r\n\r\nno longer suited changed conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Bill which seeks to regulate terms\r\n\r\nof  employment to meet the challenges of today is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, to be welcomed. No doubt it will not be\r\n\r\nwell  received by those who make it their  purpose\r\n\r\nof  life to expend the least effort and to grab as\r\n\r\nmuch  as possible by abusing every privilege  that\r\n\r\nis  available. Such people are not only unfair  to\r\n\r\ntheir employers, but also to society at large and,\r\n\r\nfinally to themselves as well. Under conditions of\r\n\r\na  colonial  administration where  the  Government\r\n\r\ntried  to exploit the country and employers  tried\r\n\r\nto  exploit workers to the full, attempts  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir  own back on their employers were excusable.\r\n\r\nSuch  behaviour,  however, is unpardonable  in  an\r\n\r\nindependent  country striving for  survival.  Here\r\n\r\nevery  one must pull his weight. There can  be  no\r\n\r\nplace for passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the proposal to extend the range\r\n\r\nof  contributors to the Central provident Fund  to\r\n\r\nmobilise savings. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed for increased funds to meet the heavy cost of\r\n\r\nmeasures  to counter the economic effects  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  withdrawal  has  been  explained  in  the\r\n\r\nstatement by the Minister for Finance.. Mobilising\r\n\r\nsavings  by  increasing the number of contributors\r\n\r\nis one of the most painless ways of doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though it is not the intention, the extension of\r\n\r\ncontributors  to include Government  servants  has\r\n\r\nalso  the  effect  of remedying the  situation  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  servants having inadequate savings  on\r\n\r\ntheir  retirement. As an ex-civil servant, I  know\r\n\r\nhow  modest is the sum known as gratuity  which  a\r\n\r\nGovernment servant gets on retirement. An  officer\r\n\r\nwho  had  reached  the  very  top  found,  on  his\r\n\r\nretirement,  that  his gratuity  was  insufficient\r\n\r\neven  to  buy  a modest house. The Provident  Fund\r\n\r\ncontributions  will be a very useful  addition  to\r\n\r\nwhat an officer will get under the Pension Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while on this subject, I wish\r\n\r\nto  correct  a  wrong impression  which  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Punggo1 might have created when he said\r\n\r\nthat   by   including   Government   servants   as\r\n\r\ncontributors  to  the Central  Provident  Fund,  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  servant will then benefit  three  ways\r\n\r\nfor  his  services: namely, pension, gratuity  and\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident  Fund  contributions.  What  is\r\n\r\ncommonly   known   as  gratuity   payable   to   a\r\n\r\npensionable officer on his retirement is  actually\r\n\r\nno  more  than  an  advance of pension,  which  is\r\n\r\nrecovered from the retired officer by paying him a\r\n\r\nreduced  pension. Therefore, it is part of pension\r\n\r\nand cannot be deemed a separate benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to support the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  motion of thanks to the President  for\r\n\r\nhis speech at the opening session of Parliament on\r\n\r\nMonday  last.  The  President in  his  speech  has\r\n\r\noutlined  three  important  objectives  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will strive to achieve over  the  next\r\n\r\nfive   years.  The  three  objectives   constitute\r\n\r\nfundamental issues which must be achieved  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  if we  truly  want  to  see\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsucceed and the country capable of standing on her\r\n\r\nown feet and capable of defending her independence\r\n\r\nand  sovereignty until the end of  time.  What  we\r\n\r\nhave   to  do  now  is  to  utilise  every  second\r\n\r\navailable   to  us  to  strengthen  our  country's\r\n\r\ndefences. At the moment, we have already a  strong\r\n\r\narmy.  We need also a powerful navy and air force.\r\n\r\nTogether with Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and\r\n\r\nBritain,  we  hope  our  country  will   have   an\r\n\r\neffective  defence capability which can  not  only\r\n\r\nensure the security of our nation but also be able\r\n\r\nto  contribute to the security of this part of the\r\n\r\nworld.  In  fact, Singapore's security  cannot  be\r\n\r\ndivorced  from  the  security  of  the  whole   of\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia. The Second World War  has  proved\r\n\r\nthat when Singapore capitulated to the enemy,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  Southeast Asia fell to the enemy.  With\r\n\r\nmodern  equipment  now available,  we  can  easily\r\n\r\nimagine that if Singapore falls into enemy  hands,\r\n\r\nnot  only will Southeast Asia fall but the  entire\r\n\r\nregion   of   Australasia  will  face   the   same\r\n\r\ncatastrophe.  This demonstrates the importance  of\r\n\r\nour   having   defence   co-operation   with   all\r\n\r\nCommonwealth countries in this part of the  world.\r\n\r\nWe  must  have  an adequate defence capability  to\r\n\r\nensure political stability in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next five years, we will be confronted\r\n\r\nwith a multitude of problems which will affect our\r\n\r\nlives. For us every problem has its solution.  Let\r\n\r\nus say to history, \"We will decide on your destiny\r\n\r\nand  not  vice  versa.\"  Any  nation  that  allows\r\n\r\nhistory  to  determine  its  destiny  will  become\r\n\r\nbankrupt and decadent. Let us determine the course\r\n\r\nof  history. Let us influence history.  We  should\r\n\r\nnot allow history to influence our destiny. If  we\r\n\r\ncan move ahead of history we will forever be safe.\r\n\r\nWe  will forever prosper and forge ahead. If we do\r\n\r\nnot wish history to decide on our destiny, we must\r\n\r\nhave   a  disciplined  society,  a  society   with\r\n\r\ncollective  leadership such as we have  today.  We\r\n\r\nneed to have a society which can be likened to  an\r\n\r\narmy. If we succeed, it will be a victory for  all\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. If we fail, it will be  a\r\n\r\ndefeat for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, events have shown that we are\r\n\r\nwell  on  the road to success. I believe that  the\r\n\r\nthree  objectives enunciated by the  President  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech will be brought to fruition. The  next\r\n\r\nfive  years shall witness the establishment  of  a\r\n\r\ndisciplined  and rugged society, but efforts  must\r\n\r\nalso   be  made  to  ensure  the  creation  of   a\r\n\r\nproductive society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that we must now start to\r\n\r\nconsider  the possibility of having as our  future\r\n\r\nslogan  the establishment of a productive society.\r\n\r\nWe must be productive in economy and productive in\r\n\r\npolitics.  We  must also be socially and  mentally\r\n\r\nproductive.  But for God's sake, let  us  be  less\r\n\r\nproductive in human procreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support the President's Speech and\r\n\r\nthe  Addendum  to  the speech in  general.  But  I\r\n\r\nshould  also ask to be allowed to say a few  words\r\n\r\non the objectives of the Government as outlined in\r\n\r\nthe  President's  Speech.  That  economic  growth,\r\n\r\nespecially   in   the  direction   of   increasing\r\n\r\nproductivity,  be  the Government's  objective  is\r\n\r\npraiseworthy. That high morale, internationally or\r\n\r\ninternally,   be   another   objective   is   also\r\n\r\npraiseworthy.  The fact is that  high  morale  and\r\n\r\neconomic growth go hand in hand. In order that the\r\n\r\npeople  can  be  spurred  on  to  greater  efforts\r\n\r\ntowards the economic growth and prosperity of  the\r\n\r\nnation,  the people's morale must be kept high.  I\r\n\r\nam  referring  to the high morale consequent  upon\r\n\r\nthe confidence which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Cheong, can you speak a little\r\n\r\nslower?  I think the interpreters are having  some\r\n\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Yes, Sir,I am\r\n\r\nreferring to the high morale consequent  upon  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  which the people will  have  in  being\r\n\r\nable  to  seek  a  better and higher  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.  For it must be remembered that while  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may measure economic growth in terms of\r\n\r\nthe  gross national product, the ordinary citizens\r\n\r\nmeasure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  in terms of per  capita  income.\r\n\r\nFurther, income is here seen not just in terms  of\r\n\r\ndollars and cents and what that money can buy, but\r\n\r\nalso in terms of what may be broadly called fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits.  Sad  to  say, it  is  in  the  proposed\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill that Government policy  is  cock-eyed. Take the extension of the 39-hour week to  a\r\n\r\n44-hour  week.  We  are  all  aware  that  a  high\r\n\r\npercentage  of the economically-active  population\r\n\r\nare  unemployed. Even way back in 1965  we  had  a\r\n\r\nlabour  force  of  573,000 of  whom  502,400  were\r\n\r\nemployed.  On  the  basis  of  the  recent  Sample\r\n\r\nHousehold  Survey  and population  projections,  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  827,775 is estimated to be  the  labour\r\n\r\nforce in 1977. This works out to be a labour force\r\n\r\ngrowth rate of 3.5 per cent per annum between 1966\r\n\r\nand  1977. This, it may interest the House, is 1.3\r\n\r\nper cent higher than the decade from 1957 to 1966,\r\n\r\nthe  decade  which represents the full  impact  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  population  explosion.  Incidentally,\r\n\r\nwho   says  that  Singapore's  population  is  not\r\n\r\nproductive? In short, if our labour force in  1977\r\n\r\nis  to  be  completely  employed,  something  like\r\n\r\n308,000 additional jobs will have to be created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basic premise of the proposed Employment\r\n\r\nBill  is \"to enable a wider spread of employment\".\r\n\r\nThis,  if  I may be allowed to say, is a  laudable\r\n\r\nobjective,  bearing in mind that we  have  a  high\r\n\r\nrate  of  the population dependent on the earnings\r\n\r\nof   only  a  comparatively  small  income-earning\r\n\r\ngroup.  This goal of the Government, if  achieved,\r\n\r\nwill  go  towards  promoting economic  growth  and\r\n\r\nraising morale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, it may be asked, does it bring about high\r\n\r\nmorale?  It  is evident by way of an  illustration\r\n\r\nthat  a  man with five mouths to feed will  surely\r\n\r\nfeel greatly relieved when his son gets a job, let\r\n\r\nalone the prospect of a bigger family income.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that  there is one dependent  less  to  feed\r\n\r\nmeans  that  there is more to go round  the  rest.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Government's objectives of economic\r\n\r\ngrowth and high morale cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  gain high commendation. But does the proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation  of  a 44-hour week help  in  any  way\r\n\r\ntowards  achieving these two objectives?  Further,\r\n\r\ndoes it in any way help towards a wider spread  of\r\n\r\nemployment?  Sir, I respectfully  submit  that  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not.  I  am,  of course,  not  unaware  that\r\n\r\ncertain   categories  of  workers  are   presently\r\n\r\nengaged  on  a  44-hour  week.  Extension  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  39-hour week involves the working  of  an\r\n\r\nadditional   five  hours  per  week  per   worker.\r\n\r\nAssuming  that 50 per cent of our employed  labour\r\n\r\nforce  of 502,000 put in the additional five hours\r\n\r\nper  week,  this would total 1,255,000  hours  per\r\n\r\nweek.  If  these  workers had continued  with  the\r\n\r\nexisting  39-hour  week, about  32,000  additional\r\n\r\njobs  could  be  created.  Sir,  I  repeat  32,000\r\n\r\nadditional jobs. This is surely a figure to reckon\r\n\r\nwith in terms of economic growth and high morale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of regulation of over-time, I\r\n\r\nshould like the House to see this in the light  of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed 44-hour week as against the  39-hour\r\n\r\nweek.  The  additional five hours  per  week  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  so affected represents a loss  of  five\r\n\r\nhours  per  week  of  overtime earnings.  This  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  a  situation  conducive  to   high\r\n\r\nmorale.  I  do  not suggest for  one  moment  that\r\n\r\nexcessive  over-time should be encouraged  in  the\r\n\r\nface  of massive unemployment. But the basis  upon\r\n\r\nwhich  excessive over-time must be  curbed  is  so\r\n\r\nthat  people  can be employed and national  income\r\n\r\nmay be increased. The basis is not for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  exploitation of labour. Yet this  is  what  it\r\n\r\nwill  amount to if overtime work is curbed on  the\r\n\r\none  hand  and hours of work are extended  on  the\r\n\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear, that this so-called comprehensive\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill that is to come is nothing  but  a\r\n\r\ncock-eyed and retrogressive policy. It  is  to  be\r\n\r\nnoted that among the measures to be implemented in\r\n\r\norder  to achieve the objective of economic growth\r\n\r\nis  one  which  seeks  to  \"limit  certain  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits    to   lessen   abuses   and    increase\r\n\r\nproductivity\". I propose to deal with  the  aspect\r\n\r\nof productivity first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that the ultimate goal of increased\r\n\r\nproductivity is to raise the standard  of  living,\r\n\r\nnot  the  cost of living. In other words,  such  a\r\n\r\ndrive  is  calculated to achieve greater  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and high morale. This is certainly another\r\n\r\nlaudable move. The success of a productivity drive\r\n\r\nmay best be evidenced in the lowering of prices of\r\n\r\ngoods  and services. It has been mentioned earlier\r\n\r\nthat   the  sum  total  of  a  man's  high  morale\r\n\r\nconstitutes, amongst other things, not merely  his\r\n\r\nincome, but rather what his money can buy. Is  any\r\n\r\ndrive to increase productivity likely to result in\r\n\r\nlower  price levels? I humbly submit, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, that the chances are not too bright. At least\r\n\r\nnot   unless   some  form  of  price  control   is\r\n\r\nestablished.  I submit the following  reasons  for\r\n\r\nmaintaining  price  controls which  are  necessary\r\n\r\nbefore lower domestic prices can result:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Protection of infant industries,\r\n\r\nnecessitating the imposition of import quotas  and\r\n\r\nrestrictions. This results in an immediate rise in\r\n\r\nprices of commodities, i.e., a price mark-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) When these same commodities are produced in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the prices are the same, if not  higher\r\n\r\nthan the marked-up prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Even when productivity is increased by virtue\r\n\r\nof   the  smallness  of  the  local  market,   the\r\n\r\nproducers  are  not  likely to  demonstrate  their\r\n\r\nconcern for lower prices of their commodities.  In\r\n\r\nshort,  coupled with the continued  protection  of\r\n\r\nindustries,  a  take-it-or-leave-it attitude  will\r\n\r\nprevail.   Who   then  benefits   from   increased\r\n\r\nproductivity? Not the workers who have sweated for\r\n\r\nit  and  not the consumers in the domestic market.\r\n\r\nFor  these  reasons, there arises the urgent  need\r\n\r\nfor  a  system  of  controls which  will  make  it\r\n\r\nimperative for producers to lower their prices. If\r\n\r\nsuch  a  system of controls is not established  to\r\n\r\ngive  an  assurance  of just rewards,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nunreasonable   to  say  that  our   workers   will\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  this  productivity   drive   with\r\n\r\nsuspicion.  For  it would be a fair  question  for\r\n\r\nthem to ask, \"Why should I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsweat  it  out so that my employer can  make  more\r\n\r\nexorbitant profits at my expense?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, it should be borne in mind that\r\n\r\nmany of these ventures are either foreign-owned or\r\n\r\njoint  ventures with high participation by foreign\r\n\r\ncapital.  The outflow of profits would, therefore,\r\n\r\naffect our balance of payments position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of limiting certain fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits to lessen abuses, I should like to hazard\r\n\r\na few guesses as to what this would mean. It would\r\n\r\nmean that paid annual leave will be reduced. As to\r\n\r\nhow much is another question. It would mean that a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  paid public holidays will be  out.  It\r\n\r\nwould  mean that the worker's entitlement of  sick\r\n\r\nleave  will be reduced whether drastically or  not\r\n\r\nis  to  be  seen.  Sir, I am  wondering  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  seeks  to drive at  by  limiting  such\r\n\r\nfringe  benefits. Does the Government hope,  along\r\n\r\nwith the proposed 44-hour week, to provide a wider\r\n\r\nspread  of  employment? If the answer  is  in  the\r\n\r\naffirmative,  then I beg to submit that  something\r\n\r\nhas  gone wrong with my little head and the  heads\r\n\r\nof many people who share my view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of limiting fringe benefits are not\r\n\r\ninconsequential  in terms of  morale  as  well  as\r\n\r\nmoney.  When examined closely, this is  tantamount\r\n\r\nto a subtle wage cut. Mr Speaker, Sir, I repeat -\r\n\r\na  subtle wage cut. I am not an economist, but the\r\n\r\nHouse  will  recall  that  not  so  long  ago  the\r\n\r\nnecessity    for   expenditure   was   emphasised,\r\n\r\nexpenditure  to counter recession.  The  necessity\r\n\r\nfor  expenditure  was argued on  the  ground  that\r\n\r\n\"expenditure   generates   income   and    creates\r\n\r\nemployment\".  My  argument is this.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nspend, we need income. If income is cut, how  much\r\n\r\ncan we spend? Further, as presented earlier, there\r\n\r\nis  the  argument for non-extension of the 39-hour\r\n\r\nweek  on the ground that additional jobs will then\r\n\r\nbe  created.  With the availability  of  jobs  and\r\n\r\nincome,  expenditure  is  forthcoming.  All   this\r\n\r\nresults   again   in  the  creation   of   further\r\n\r\nemployment,  greater  economic  growth  and   high\r\n\r\nmorale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not unaware of the proposed second Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund contribution which, for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  collective bargaining, would count as part  of\r\n\r\nthe  wage  bill.  But I have doubts  whether  this\r\n\r\ncompulsory contribution will be able to offset the\r\n\r\nlosses  that  arise  with the proposed  Employment\r\n\r\nBill.  The  spate of retrenchment has grown  quite\r\n\r\nalarmingly.  I  fear that the proposed  Employment\r\n\r\nBill  will aggravate the situation, not mentioning\r\n\r\nthe  temptation  of  management  to  misuse  their\r\n\r\nauthority. In this connection, I would support the\r\n\r\nhon. Member who spoke before me and would urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consider seriously the setting up of\r\n\r\na  retrenchment  and!  or  unemployment  insurance\r\n\r\nscheme.  The  ranks of the unemployed are  already\r\n\r\nmassive  without  the retrenched workers  swelling\r\n\r\ntheir  ranks. The price we have to pay for such  a\r\n\r\nrestive, displaced and literate population is  too\r\n\r\nheavy.   In  many  developing  countries,  Marxist\r\n\r\ntheory  has won great appeal. Our task is  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  this threat does not become real. If radical\r\n\r\nchanges must come, be it in the Employment Bill or\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  I plead that this threat be  borne  in\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the proposed additional Central\r\n\r\nProvident    Fund   contributions    are    indeed\r\n\r\ncommendable.  I  should like to consider  this  in\r\n\r\nrelation to the civil service employees when  they\r\n\r\nresign.  The  present Government  regulations  are\r\n\r\nsuch  that when an employee resigns, he  does  not\r\n\r\nget   a   cent  by  way  of  gratuity  or  accrued\r\n\r\nretirement benefits. This is the case irrespective\r\n\r\nof  whether  the employee has served  five  or  15\r\n\r\nyears. We are all agreed that such regulations are\r\n\r\ntrappings  of a colonial era intended  to  exploit\r\n\r\nthe  workers  in  a colony. We are further  agreed\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government, being the largest employer,\r\n\r\nmust be a model employer in terms of fairness  and\r\n\r\njustice to its employees. I maintain that  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is a government of the people, it  must\r\n\r\nrid  itself of the vestiges of colonial  trappings\r\n\r\nand  give  its employees a fair deal. I  therefore\r\n\r\nurge   the   Government   to   consider   granting\r\n\r\ngratuities and such other relevant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbenefits when their employees resign..

I should like  to  end\r\n\r\nhere  as  I began, by saying that except  for  the\r\n\r\nviews  expressed by me, I support the  President's\r\n\r\nSpeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, every head of state of a country has\r\n\r\nto  make  a  policy  statement.  Perhaps  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries, the delivering of the policy  statement\r\n\r\nwill be merely an official ceremony. Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnow  an  independent Republic after 150  years  of\r\n\r\nexistence, and the President delivered the  policy\r\n\r\nstatement  at  a time when new faces  appeared  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  to  instil  a  new  spirit  into  the\r\n\r\nleadership of our country. This is a milestone  in\r\n\r\nour  social  development and it also reflects  the\r\n\r\ndirection  of the social development  and  changes\r\n\r\nthat  will come about. We do not have to wait  for\r\n\r\nfive  years to judge the results and the worth  of\r\n\r\nthe  policy  statement delivered by the  President\r\n\r\nbecause  it is well planned. At the same time,  we\r\n\r\nhave   a   strong  and  dynamic  leadership   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  we  can  foresee the  results  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's Speech has made\r\n\r\nus   understand  that  not  only  is  our  society\r\n\r\nchanging  but  the whole of South  and  South-east\r\n\r\nAsia  is  also changing. We must be awake to  this\r\n\r\nsituation. We must recognise our attitude and  the\r\n\r\nwork   we  are  doing,  which  are  factors   that\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  changes. Although  we  cannot\r\n\r\nforesee  future events in detail, we can make  use\r\n\r\nof   existing   factors   to   create   favourable\r\n\r\nconditions  and  guide the trend of  events  in  a\r\n\r\ndirection that is more favourable to us. In order\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   achieve   this,  we  must  first  consolidate\r\n\r\nourselves.  The more stable our society,  and  the\r\n\r\nmore consolidated we are, the greater will be  our\r\n\r\ninfluence  over these changes. I call  this  trend\r\n\r\nstabilising  strength.  Generally,  when  we  talk\r\n\r\nabout  stabilising strength, we do not  mean  just\r\n\r\neconomic  and  defence strength.  The  comparative\r\n\r\nstrength  in party politics should also  be  taken\r\n\r\ninto  account. The present phenomenon of one party\r\n\r\nin  this House is also a valid reflection  on  the\r\n\r\ncomparative  political party  strength.  But  this\r\n\r\ncomparative strength comes within a constitutional\r\n\r\nscope.  The  existence of one party in this  House\r\n\r\nand  the  near  unanimous opinion of  its  Members\r\n\r\nshould not be interpreted as the proportion of the\r\n\r\ncomparative political strength among the people to\r\n\r\nbe  100  to  one  without any latent  or  apparent\r\n\r\nopposition force. But it cannot be denied that the\r\n\r\nexistence   of  one  party  in  this   House   can\r\n\r\nadequately   reflect   the  comparative   strength\r\n\r\nbetween   the  majority  party  and  the  minority\r\n\r\nextremists.  In fact, the victory of democracy  is\r\n\r\nnormally   defined   by  majority   support.   Our\r\n\r\ndemocratic  victory is true and reliable,  because\r\n\r\nthe  existence of only one party in this House  is\r\n\r\nthe result of the general consent of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore through democratic elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason lies in the fact that in the\r\n\r\nhistory of Singapore since 1946 - two decades  ago\r\n\r\n-  political  victories could only be won  through\r\n\r\nconstitutional channels. Constitutional  victories\r\n\r\nhave  been won by the democratic socialists.  Such\r\n\r\nexamples are not lacking. On the other hand, we do\r\n\r\nnot   see  many  such  victories  going   to   the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  It  is  very seldom  that  they  have\r\n\r\nachieved  victory  through  constitutional  means.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  know that our democratic  victory  has\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved in a series of waves which are  not\r\n\r\nisolated  from one another. Our victory  has  been\r\n\r\nwon on a constitutional basis. But the changes  in\r\n\r\nturbulent  South and Southeast Asia  and  even  in\r\n\r\nlarger international confines are not entirely  in\r\n\r\nkeeping   with  constitutional  development.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,   the   war  in   Vietnam   is   not   a\r\n\r\nconstitutional war. Not one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbomb  dropped  in Vietnam is done constitutionally\r\n\r\nby  a  prior statement to that effect. Many of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and I appeared on the political  scene\r\n\r\nwhen  politics reached a decisive stage at a  time\r\n\r\nwhen   there   was   a   struggle   against    the\r\n\r\nConstitution.   Some  of  us  went   through   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  upheaval when  Singapore  withdrew\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia.  We  should, in  our  minds,  make\r\n\r\ncertain  preparations to meet the changes, whether\r\n\r\nour  feeling is one of hardship after  the  trials\r\n\r\nand  tribulations  or one of  great  daring  after\r\n\r\novercoming  these difficulties.  The  greater  our\r\n\r\nachievements, the greater is our need  for  making\r\n\r\nthese preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak more\r\n\r\nabout  these  preparations. The first  concept  in\r\n\r\nmaking  these preparations is to have the  fullest\r\n\r\ncontrol over the time and human factors so that we\r\n\r\ncan progress as fast as possible. In this respect,\r\n\r\nwe cannot remain static in our approach or adopt a\r\n\r\nwait-and-see attitude. We should try  to  progress\r\n\r\nas fast as possible. We should try to run a 3,000-metre \r\n\r\nrace at a speed as if we are running a  100-metre  race.  \r\n\r\nIt is only in this way that  we  can\r\n\r\nensure  our survival. This principle is  known  by\r\n\r\nmany of our neighbouring countries. We are not the\r\n\r\nonly   people   who  know  about  this.   We   are\r\n\r\nendeavouring  to  develop  aviation  whereas   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring   country,   Malaysia,   is   already\r\n\r\nnegotiating   a  civil  aviation  agreement   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia and relaxing some of the restrictions on\r\n\r\naviation.  Furthermore, Indonesia is  prepared  to\r\n\r\ntrain Malaysian pilots. Mr Speaker, Sir, when  we\r\n\r\nare  doing this, we cannot help thinking  that  we\r\n\r\nare  a  small  country. In terms of  manpower,  we\r\n\r\nshould  equate  one man to 100 men.  In  terms  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure, we should equate $1 to $100. In other\r\n\r\nwords, we should try to achieve maximum results at\r\n\r\na  minimum cost. In terms of time, one year to  us\r\n\r\nshould  be longer than 100 years to other  people.\r\n\r\nOf  course, this does not mean that we live  in  a\r\n\r\nfairy  land where seven days are equated to  1,000\r\n\r\nyears.  Rather  we should try to  strive  for  the\r\n\r\nhighest value in every respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I go on now to the second\r\n\r\nconcept  in making these preparations. Put simply,\r\n\r\nit   is  this.  Our  basic  standpoint  should  be\r\n\r\ninflexible, but in strategy we should be flexible.\r\n\r\nIf we make these preparations, even though we have\r\n\r\nwon  our constitutional struggle, we will  not  be\r\n\r\nlike  the  Romans in history who, while they  were\r\n\r\nstill  dreaming beautiful dreams, were invaded  by\r\n\r\nthe barbarians and as a result, their civilisation\r\n\r\nwas   destroyed.  Although  they   preserved   the\r\n\r\nJustinian Roman law or legal code, it was  no  use\r\n\r\nto them. One of our objectives should be to try to\r\n\r\nhave    the    constitutional    supersede     the\r\n\r\nunconstitutional. When we talk about  flexibility,\r\n\r\nI think we should take note that in our Parliament\r\n\r\nwe  have  only  one party. This, however,  is  not\r\n\r\ncontrary to the spirit of democracy. It is  merely\r\n\r\nan expression of democratic strength which has led\r\n\r\nto  the  creation of a somewhat unusual situation.\r\n\r\nThe  main reason is that the democratic system has\r\n\r\na   certain  tradition  which  is  based  on   the\r\n\r\nWestminster  model. Therefore, by comparison,  our\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system  is  rather  new.   We   should\r\n\r\ntherefore  adapt  ourselves,  in  concept  and  in\r\n\r\ntheory,  to  the democratic system. In  any  case,\r\n\r\nalthough  we  have only one party  in  Parliament,\r\n\r\nthis  does  not  mean  that we  have  a  one-party\r\n\r\nautocracy. Our constitution still provides for  an\r\n\r\nOpposition  party and it can enter  Parliament  by\r\n\r\ntaking  part  in  democratic elections.  What  the\r\n\r\nCommunists want is a one-party autocracy.  If  our\r\n\r\nparty  were  a one-party autocracy, we would  have\r\n\r\ngained  the  praise and support of  the  Communist\r\n\r\nParty.  However,  the  slanderous  and  derogatory\r\n\r\nremarks made by the Communists on Parliament  show\r\n\r\nthat we do not have a one-party autocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know that in transplanting the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system from Western soil to Asia, there\r\n\r\nare difficulties involved. These can be likened to\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties  that beset a heart  transplant.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in the case of Burma - the  Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the Revolutionary Council of Burma, General Ne\r\n\r\nWin, came to Singapore recently -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsocial  democracy was practised at one  time.  But\r\n\r\nlater they had to abolish the traditional election\r\n\r\nsystem.  In fact, in some developing countries  in\r\n\r\nAfrica,  there has emerged one school  of  thought\r\n\r\nwhich holds that the one-party system rather  than\r\n\r\na  multi-party  system  is  necessary  during  the\r\n\r\ntransitional   period  between  independence   and\r\n\r\nstability.  For  example,  in  Kenya,  there   was\r\n\r\npractice  of  a  one-party system  for  some  time\r\n\r\nbefore  the multi-party system was revived in  the\r\n\r\nface  of great stability. In Tanzania, we can  see\r\n\r\nthe  present  practice  of a democratic  one-party\r\n\r\nsystem.  What  is  the feature  of  the  one-party\r\n\r\nsystem?  It  is  the  intoleration  of  Opposition\r\n\r\nparties.  This is quite different from the  system\r\n\r\nthat  we  have in Singapore. Here, apart from  the\r\n\r\nparty in power in Parliament, there are Opposition\r\n\r\nparties  outside  Parliament.  This  is  a   clear\r\n\r\nindication that we are not practising a  one-party\r\n\r\ndictatorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in a democratic system, we should be\r\n\r\nmore  concerned with the multiplicity of political\r\n\r\nparties.  There  should  always  be  one  or   two\r\n\r\npolitical parties strong enough to take  over  the\r\n\r\nreins of government. However, the multiplicity  of\r\n\r\npolitical  parties would mean the emergence  of  a\r\n\r\nfeeble   coalition  government  followed  by   the\r\n\r\ntragedy of a coup d'etat and the abolition of  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic system itself. For example, in trouble-stricken  Congo there were at one time  about  200\r\n\r\npolitical   parties   in  existence.   But   their\r\n\r\nexistence  did not bring any happiness or  benefit\r\n\r\nto  the  people. Instead the existence of so  many\r\n\r\nparties  brought crises and troubles. In Singapore\r\n\r\nthere  are about 20 political parties, both active\r\n\r\nand dormant. In so far as the democratic system is\r\n\r\nconcerned, this is not necessarily a bad sign.  We\r\n\r\nare still in good health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, whether a new Opposition party will\r\n\r\nemerge  in  Parliament in the l970s is a  question\r\n\r\nfor  the future. At the present juncture, we  need\r\n\r\nnot  over-emphasise the advantages of a  one-party\r\n\r\nParliament. If we do have to emphasise it, we  can\r\n\r\nvery well say that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  a  small  nation like Singapore surrounded  by\r\n\r\nother  countries,  we  do  require  a  strong  and\r\n\r\ninvincible party in power in Parliament. If we  do\r\n\r\nhave  to explain why there is the emergence  of  a\r\n\r\none-party  Parliament in Singapore,  we  can  very\r\n\r\nwell  say  that  it is because of the  enlightened\r\n\r\nleadership  in  our party. It is  because  of  the\r\n\r\nobvious achievements which we have made, and which\r\n\r\nare  well known to everybody, that it is no wonder\r\n\r\nthat  we have been able to sweep the board of  all\r\n\r\nthe  58  seats.  These are not  matters  which  we\r\n\r\nshould argue about. We should, however, adopt this\r\n\r\nattitude; we must accept a one-party Parliament as\r\n\r\na   fait   accompli.  Then  under  the  democratic\r\n\r\narrangements we must try to do better than a multi-party Parliament. In any case, we should try to do\r\n\r\nno  less better than a multi-party Parliament.  At\r\n\r\nthe  present moment, there is no Opposition in our\r\n\r\nParliament,  but the reform and the reorganisation\r\n\r\nthat  the  present Government is seeking to  carry\r\n\r\nout  is  beyond the imagination of any  Opposition\r\n\r\nparty,  even  if one were to turn up. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nwe  have  new blood in our Parliament and we  have\r\n\r\nmade our Members of Parliament more representative\r\n\r\nby  choosing them from all walks of life.  In  the\r\n\r\nPresident's policy speech we can see that there is\r\n\r\ndetermination to seek improvement and changes.  We\r\n\r\nhave  no desire to rest on our laurels. All  these\r\n\r\nare  indications that even without an  Opposition,\r\n\r\nwe  are capable of marching forward. This has been\r\n\r\nthe  point  raised  and agreed to  by  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament when they support the motion of thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I now wish to deal with some points\r\n\r\nraised  by  several  Members of  this  House.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Punggol and the Member for Jurong  have\r\n\r\nmentioned the difficulties of some fishermen  who,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  went  out for deep-sea  fishing,  were\r\n\r\nthemselves whisked away by pirates. I remember  on\r\n\r\nthe  24th January last when Parliament sat,  these\r\n\r\nsame  Members raised the same question  that  they\r\n\r\nare  raising today. I would like them to read  the\r\n\r\nreport  in  Hansard concerning  this  matter.  The\r\n\r\nanswer given by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister of State concerned is still valid.  There\r\n\r\nhas  been no change. What I would like to  explain\r\n\r\nto  this House is that the Ministry of Defence has\r\n\r\nnow  strengthened the marine patrol  system  which\r\n\r\nwill  improve  the situation. There will  be  more\r\n\r\npatrol boats to handle this kind of situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has mentioned the two-year military training under the national service\r\n\r\nscheme for university and college students, and he\r\n\r\nrequested  that the period of training  should  be\r\n\r\nreduced to one year. He said two years would be  a\r\n\r\nwaste of their knowledge. But I would say that  we\r\n\r\nare   still  growing  and  the  youths  are  still\r\n\r\ngrowing.  So  this  is the best  time  for  us  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  our  strength. What  we  need  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  is not a very large army but a small  army\r\n\r\nof  regulars  supported  by  a  large  reserve  of\r\n\r\nnational servicemen. We are adopting the principle\r\n\r\nof  quality and not quantity. If we want  quality,\r\n\r\ntwo  years' military training may not be too  long\r\n\r\nfor  university or college graduates  to  man  our\r\n\r\nfuture army. If we look at the Hitler type of hair-do  of the Member for Ulu Pandan, we can know that\r\n\r\nhe  is frustrated by the considerations he has  in\r\n\r\nmind.  But we must, first of all, consolidate  our\r\n\r\ndefence,  so that everybody will have a  sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity,  before we can put all  our  talents  to\r\n\r\nbetter  use. If we are faced with the  problem  of\r\n\r\nnational   security,  even  if  we   have   enough\r\n\r\ngraduates with a wealth of talent, we cannot  make\r\n\r\nfull  use of that. When a country does not  exist,\r\n\r\nwhere  can  its  people use  their  talent?  Their\r\n\r\ncapability  and knowledge cannot be used  at  all.\r\n\r\nThe  best  one can do is to compile statistics  to\r\n\r\nshow how -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
