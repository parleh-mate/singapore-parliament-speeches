-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhether  he can give an update on the retrenchment  situation\r\n\r\nand projection of job creation for this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, a total of 3,248 workers were retrenched in the\r\n\r\nfirst   quarter   of  this  year.  In  the  second   quarter,\r\n\r\npreliminary   findings  of  our  survey  on  private   sector\r\n\r\nestablishments with at least 25 workers show that some  5,600\r\n\r\nworkers  were  affected by retrenchments. Based on  voluntary\r\n\r\nnotifications  by companies to the Ministry,  the  number  of\r\n\r\nworkers affected by retrenchments in the third quarter  would\r\n\r\nbe higher than the figures registered in the first and second\r\n\r\nquarters. For the whole of this year, the estimated number of\r\n\r\nworkers  who  may be retrenched could reach 20,000.  This  is\r\n\r\nsignificantly higher than the figure of 11,624  recorded last\r\n\r\nyear  but  is  lower than the figure of 29,086 retrenched  in\r\n\r\n1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total employment in the first quarter of this year rose\r\n\r\nby  23,210,  seasonally lower than the  35,066  in  the  last\r\n\r\nquarter  of 2000. However, based on changes in employment  up\r\n\r\nto  May  and  forecast  of economic conditions  ahead,  total\r\n\r\nemployment  for  this year is likely to be flat  or  slightly\r\n\r\nnegative  as  against a sharp employment gain of  108,500  in\r\n\r\n2000.  Unemployment is expected to rise to around 4% by  year\r\n\r\nend.  However, the  forecast of annual average\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunemployment for 2001 is lower in the range of   3%  to  3.5%\r\n\r\nbecause  of the generally lower figures in the first half  as\r\n\r\nunemployment tends to lag economic activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> In view of such a high\r\n\r\nnumber of retrenchments, does the Ministry have any plans  to\r\n\r\nhelp the retrenched workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I will give the Member the\r\n\r\nanswer when he asks the next Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SECTORS FACING SHORTAGE OF WORKERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\n(a) whether there are sectors currently facing a shortage  of\r\n\r\nworkers  and,  if  so, which are the sectors;   and  (b)  how\r\n\r\nSingaporean  workers can be given assistance to  qualify  for\r\n\r\njobs in these sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the employment\r\n\r\nsituation, as I have just mentioned earlier, has deteriorated\r\n\r\nover  the past few months due to the economic downturn.   The\r\n\r\nconstruction and manufacturing sectors have been  badly  hit,\r\n\r\nwith   net   employment  declining   by   2,160   and   1,075\r\n\r\nrespectively,  in  the  first  quarter  of  this  year.    In\r\n\r\ncontrast,  the  services  sector has  continued  to  register\r\n\r\npositive  employment growth of 28,200 over the  same  period.\r\n\r\nJob  vacancies  were  highest in the transport,  storage  and\r\n\r\ncommunication industries, which saw nearly 3,000 job openings\r\n\r\nin the first quarter of this year.  Other services industries\r\n\r\nsuch  as financial services, wholesale and retail trade  also\r\n\r\nhad high job vacancies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the situation may have worsened since then, there\r\n\r\nare  still job opportunities.  According to industry feedback\r\n\r\nin  recent months, there continue to be job vacancies in  the\r\n\r\nservices  sector.   For  instance, there  is  a  shortage  of\r\n\r\nhousekeepers, receptionists, waiters/waitresses and cooks  in\r\n\r\nthe   hotel  and  restaurant  sector;  ambulance  attendants,\r\n\r\nhealthcare assistants in the healthcare sector; and childcare\r\n\r\nassistants in the education\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsector.  The  transport and logistics sector is  also  hiring\r\n\r\nvehicle mechanics and warehouse assistants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still facing a shortage of nurses, pharmacists,\r\n\r\nradiographers  in  the healthcare sector; and  administrative\r\n\r\nsupport  staff  in  the  education sector.   There  are  also\r\n\r\nvacancies for network analysts and software developers in the\r\n\r\ninfocomm  sector; actuaries and underwriters in  the  finance\r\n\r\nsector;  and  engineers and technicians in the pharmaceutical\r\n\r\nand aerospace industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While manufacturing industries such as the electronics\r\n\r\nindustry are cutting jobs, there are still jobs available  in\r\n\r\nthe services sector.  However, the skill sets required in the\r\n\r\nservices  sector  may be different.  To help  our  older  and\r\n\r\nlower skilled retrenched workers make the switch to new jobs,\r\n\r\nwe  started  a pilot programme called the 'People  for  Jobs'\r\n\r\nTraineeship  Programme in June this year.  This  is  like  an\r\n\r\napprentice  programme  for mid-career  workers.   Under  this\r\n\r\nprogramme, my Ministry provides financial support  of  up  to\r\n\r\n$3.80  per  hour or $600 per month for 3 months for companies\r\n\r\nwhich  employ  the  older  retrenched  workers.   This   will\r\n\r\nencourage  employers to recruit retrenched workers  and  ease\r\n\r\ntheir transition to a new industry and work environment.   To\r\n\r\ndate, more than 30 companies from various industries like the\r\n\r\nhotel,  retail, security service sectors have already  signed\r\n\r\non  with  this  programme.  They have  made  available  1,000\r\n\r\nvacancies  for  room attendants, sales assistants,  cashiers,\r\n\r\nsecurity officers and others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to help Singaporeans better qualify for the\r\n\r\navailable positions, my Ministry works closely with  relevant\r\n\r\norganisations  to  enhance  the  short  and  long  term   re-employment prospects of retrenched workers through  training.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  under the sponsorship of surrogate  employers\r\n\r\nsuch   as   the   NTUC   and  self-help  groups,   retrenched\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can benefit from Skills Redevelopment  Programme\r\n\r\ntraining.   To encourage these surrogate employers  to  reach\r\n\r\nout  to  more  workers,  from 1st  August  2001,  the  Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill increase its course fee support for trainees aged 40 and\r\n\r\nabove  under the surrogate employer scheme from 80% to  100%.\r\n\r\nAs  for trainees below 40 years old, my Ministry will provide\r\n\r\na separate grant from the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to\r\n\r\nsurrogate employers to help offset part of their cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will equip displaced workers with the\r\n\r\nright  skills  for available jobs.  We will  also  supplement\r\n\r\ntraining   efforts  with  employment  assistance   to   match\r\n\r\nindividuals  with  jobs. The Career Centre  at  my  Ministry,\r\n\r\nCareerLink@mom, provides free employment assistance  services\r\n\r\nto  Singaporeans.  From this month,  my Ministry will also be\r\n\r\nstarting  a  series  of community based job  fairs  to  bring\r\n\r\ntogether job seekers and employers.  We target to organise an\r\n\r\naverage of one job fair per month for the rest of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will do its best to help retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  transit to new jobs in new industries  that  require\r\n\r\ndifferent skills.  However, we urge retrenched workers to  be\r\n\r\nflexible and adaptable, and make the necessary adjustments to\r\n\r\ntake  on  these jobs, such as accepting shift work  and  even\r\n\r\nworking occasionally on weekends.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  ask the Minister whether he agrees that the quality of our\r\n\r\nservices  sector could be further improved compared  to  many\r\n\r\ncountries, especially the consumer services?  May I also  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether now is the opportune time  to  address\r\n\r\nthis issue and how would his Ministry address this issue?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot say that my\r\n\r\nMinistry is an expert on the quality of service in the retail\r\n\r\nsector.   But  we have seen reports or comments where  people\r\n\r\nhave  felt  that the quality of service of the retail  sector\r\n\r\npersonnel  needs  further improvement.  If  we  look  at  the\r\n\r\nexperience of some other countries, I remember in the  middle\r\n\r\nof  the  80s, Hong Kong underwent a severe economic downturn.\r\n\r\nPrior  to  that,  Hong Kong had a rather poor reputation  for\r\n\r\nservice  quality  but, as a result of the economic  downturn,\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  dramatic transformation.  Hong  Kong's  retail\r\n\r\nsector,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  particular, and the services sector, in general,  made  a\r\n\r\nreally  dramatic improvement in the quality of  service  that\r\n\r\nthey were offering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, in the same way, with this downturn and the\r\n\r\nloosening of the labour market where jobs do not easily  come\r\n\r\nby,  people who move into the services sector should  make  a\r\n\r\ngreater effort to provide better service to ensure that  they\r\n\r\ncan hold on to their jobs and, in general, that will help  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  quality of service.  At the same  time,  training\r\n\r\nwill  also  make a difference.  That is why in our  programme\r\n\r\nlike `People for Jobs' Traineeship Programme, one of the  key\r\n\r\nfactors is to require the employer to provide proper training\r\n\r\nfor  the  new recruits and part of this training will include\r\n\r\nproviding better service quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also providing community-based CREST training\r\n\r\nmodules.  These are basic learning-to-learn skills which  can\r\n\r\nhelp workers to better understand how to relate to customers'\r\n\r\nrequirements and how to improve the service quality that they\r\n\r\nhave  to provide.  In fact, there are several programmes that\r\n\r\nwill  help to enhance the skills and service quality  of  our\r\n\r\nretail and services sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, it may be more difficult for us\r\n\r\nto  shift the existing manufacturing workers to jobs  in  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare  sector  like  nursing and administrative  support\r\n\r\nstaff  in  MOE.  But I think it is easier for us to  consider\r\n\r\nhelping  the  manufacturing workers to move to  jobs  in  the\r\n\r\nhotel  and  transport sectors.  Would the  Ministry  consider\r\n\r\nsome  concrete  plans or conversion programme to  help  these\r\n\r\nworkers  and,  more importantly, to assist the  employers  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  also change their mindset to  accept  these\r\n\r\nolder workers from the manufacturing sector?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the `People for Jobs'\r\n\r\nTraineeship Programme will in fact address the concern raised\r\n\r\nby the Member.  Those who are shifting from the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector into jobs, whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  is in the transport, warehousing or services sector, will\r\n\r\nreceive  some training by the employers who will also receive\r\n\r\nGovernment  support  of up to $600 per month  for  the  first\r\n\r\nthree months of the worker's employment.  This will help them\r\n\r\nto overcome the initial difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the jobs in the healthcare sector are\r\n\r\nsuitable  for  those  in  the  manufacturing  sector  to   be\r\n\r\nredeployed  to, there are some jobs in the healthcare  sector\r\n\r\nthat   require  almost  professional  qualifications  and   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it will not be easy for people to shift  over  to\r\n\r\nthese  jobs.   But  there  are also jobs  in  the  healthcare\r\n\r\nsector, for instance, nursing assistants or nursing aides who\r\n\r\nhelp  in  the general running of providing basic services  in\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals, which can be taken but, of course, with  some\r\n\r\nform  of  training, because it is a totally different working\r\n\r\nenvironment and the requirements are quite different.  But we\r\n\r\nare  prepared to help employers who are ready to recruit  the\r\n\r\ndisplaced  workers from the manufacturing sector and  to  put\r\n\r\nthem into these jobs in the healthcare sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister three questions.  The first is, while I commend\r\n\r\nthese  extra efforts, may I enquire how much this would cost.\r\n\r\nThe second question is:  are there targets?  How effective do\r\n\r\nwe  hope to be in creating the number of jobs that we hope to\r\n\r\ncreate  or  match?  And thirdly, can I ask  the  Minister  if\r\n\r\nthere will be a special effort to target or differentiate the\r\n\r\nhigher  educated, the white-collar and managerial people  who\r\n\r\nwill lose jobs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we set out with a\r\n\r\nmodest  budget  to  start off as a pilot  project  for  these\r\n\r\npeople for a jobs programme in June this year.  But since the\r\n\r\nsituation has got worse since then, we are prepared to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  budget and, as my colleague, the Minister for Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry, said on 25th July when he announced the package  of\r\n\r\nmeasures,  the  Government is prepared  to  put  in  as  much\r\n\r\nfinancial resources as necessary to keep this programme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrunning  as  long as there are takers from the employers  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  workers who are prepared to make  the  effort  to\r\n\r\nacquire  the  new  skills  to  work  in  the  jobs  that  are\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How effective? We will measure the effectiveness at the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  day  by the rate at which we can  redeploy  the\r\n\r\ndisplaced  workers  from the manufacturing  sector  into  the\r\n\r\nservices  sector.   In a way, it is to avoid  increasing  the\r\n\r\ndegree   of  structural  unemployment  among  our  workforce,\r\n\r\nbecause if we do not succeed in making this redeployment, and\r\n\r\nknowing  that many of the manufacturing sector's  low-skilled\r\n\r\njobs are unlikely to return even if the economy turns around,\r\n\r\nwe  may  well be saddled with a very high level of structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.  So at the end of the day, we can  measure  how\r\n\r\neffective  our  programmes  are  if  we  are  able  to   keep\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment as low as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question about special efforts to differentiate\r\n\r\nthe  higher skilled workers, as I mentioned in my main reply,\r\n\r\nthere  are also jobs for the higher skilled workers that  are\r\n\r\navailable today in the infocomm sector.  For instance, in the\r\n\r\nhealthcare sector, there are also jobs for professionals.  As\r\n\r\nI  have  also  mentioned previously, for most of  the  higher\r\n\r\neducated,  it  is  not so much a question of  further  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading,  because they are already highly  skilled,  highly\r\n\r\neducated  individuals.  So they may be far more adaptable  to\r\n\r\ntake  on different kinds of jobs with different requirements.\r\n\r\nTheir job skills may not perfectly fit what is available now.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we are prepared to help them acquire a  set  of\r\n\r\nskills  that can help them in taking on the new jobs,  and  I\r\n\r\nrefer  specifically to a programme that we launched in  1999.\r\n\r\nThis  is  called the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  programme  that will reach  out  to  the  better\r\n\r\neducated  who need to acquire a different set of job  skills,\r\n\r\neg,  those who are already degree or diploma holders  but  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  sufficient expertise in the infocomm sector.   And\r\n\r\nthis is one sector that is still generating job vacancies and\r\n\r\nlooking for people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are prepared to help them undergo a short period\r\n\r\nof  training to acquire the infocomm skills, then they can go\r\n\r\ninto  these  jobs.   We  have  extended  the  programme  from\r\n\r\ninfocomm to e-learning and we will be looking at other  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  we  can likewise provide a similar conversion training\r\n\r\nfor  the  better  educated  so that  they  can  take  on  the\r\n\r\navailable jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Education\r\n\r\n(a)   how   many   schools  have  established  Parent-Teacher\r\n\r\nAssociations  (PTAs); (b) whether schools with PTAs  (i)  are\r\n\r\neffective in fostering shared responsibility between teachers\r\n\r\nand  parents in the children's education; and (ii) have  less\r\n\r\ncomplaints by parents against teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, about two-thirds of our schools\r\n\r\nhave  established parent support structures.  Out  of  these,\r\n\r\nabout  5% of them have registered parent-teacher associations\r\n\r\n(PTAs)  and about 65% have established parent support  groups\r\n\r\n(PSGs).   Parent  support groups are more informal,  allowing\r\n\r\nparents to contribute their time and effort whenever they are\r\n\r\nable  to  do  so,  and the remaining schools are  in  varying\r\n\r\nstages of setting up their parent support structures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These structures have helped foster a shared\r\n\r\nresponsibility between parents and teachers in the children's\r\n\r\neducation.

First, there are many types  of  health\r\n\r\nscreening, of which many are not cost effective.  Second, for\r\n\r\ncertain cost-effective health screenings, such as mammography\r\n\r\nand  pap  smear, my Ministry has already made them affordable\r\n\r\nby  providing heavy subsidies at the polyclinics.   Also,  we\r\n\r\nhave introduced the Community Health Screening Programme  for\r\n\r\nthe  elderly to detect diabetes, hypertension and high  blood\r\n\r\ncholesterol.  Again, the cost is minimal, as the elderly pays\r\n\r\nup   to  $5  for  the  screening  which  costs  around   $20.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Singaporeans need not rely on Medisave to pay  for\r\n\r\ncost-effective health screening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always the temptation to liberalise Medisave\r\n\r\nfor  various types of healthcare services.

So  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask the Minister whether  he  will  consider\r\n\r\nlooking  at  the  various  kinds of screening  again  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether these can be introduced at some point of time in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is indeed what\r\n\r\nwe have done.  We all believe in evidence-based medicine, and\r\n\r\nwe  regularly  look  at the tests which  are  done.   If  the\r\n\r\nclinical  trials  and the tests show that  certain  types  of\r\n\r\nscreening  are indeed effective, then we introduce these  and\r\n\r\nwe  make  these mass-based.  This we have done for pap  smear\r\n\r\nand  mammography,  and we have also done, for  the  community\r\n\r\nhealth screening, for diabetes and high blood cholesterol and\r\n\r\nhypertension.   But  there  is  a  wide  range   of   medical\r\n\r\nscreenings.  So we look at the evidence and, if the  evidence\r\n\r\nshows  that a nation-wide mass screening is effective, we  do\r\n\r\nindeed undertake this screening.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can think of one\r\n\r\nexample  of  screening that would help manage  the  patients'\r\n\r\nmedical resources in the long term.  For instance, if we  can\r\n\r\nscope Singaporeans intensively and aggressively, we can  help\r\n\r\ndetect  some  form  of stomach cancer and colorectal  cancer.\r\n\r\nAnd  early detection in these areas of cancer would be useful\r\n\r\nfor the patients concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no evidence\r\n\r\nright  now that a nation-wide scoping, as Mr Sin puts it,  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be cost effective in preventing or detecting  these\r\n\r\ncancers  early  enough.   There  are  just  too  many   false\r\n\r\npositives and false negatives involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Health whether he agrees that prevention is better  than\r\n\r\ncure.   If  it  is,  would he not encourage  more  people  to\r\n\r\npractise this concept using their own funds by allowing  them\r\n\r\nto  go  for health screening for the common cancers, such  as\r\n\r\ncolorectal  cancer as mentioned earlier by  my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr  Sin Boon Ann, and breast cancer  using  their\r\n\r\nMedisave?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do believe that prevention is\r\n\r\nbetter  than cure and, therefore, I urge all Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  very  healthy lifestyle.  Screening  is  not  a  key\r\n\r\nmechanism  for  prevention.  If we all undertake  to  have  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  lifestyle, we will go a long way  in  making  health\r\n\r\ncare affordable and reducing healthcare costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, I have not ruled out health screening as\r\n\r\na  useful  device.   But before we undertake  a  mass  health\r\n\r\nscreening  and  also  allow Medisave to be  used  for  health\r\n\r\nscreening, we have to be very careful.  First, we have to  be\r\n\r\nconvinced  that  the  health screening based  on  trials  and\r\n\r\nevidence is effective, otherwise we undertake a major  health\r\n\r\nscreening  and  we get people all worked up, too  many  false\r\n\r\nresults and it is not money put to good use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must remember that Medisave is really\r\n\r\nintended  as savings for medical treatment for old age.   The\r\n\r\namount  of money that we put aside for Medisave is estimated,\r\n\r\nfor  the  average  Singaporean, to pay for  about  10  or  11\r\n\r\nhospitalisation  episodes.  So if we  ask  our  constituents,\r\n\r\nthose  below 60 years old, as I do regularly in the  dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions, to put up their hands if they had been hospitalised\r\n\r\nmore  than twice or thrice, very few had done so.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nmost  of  the hospitalisation episodes are when we  are  old,\r\n\r\nwhen  we are 65, 70 or 75.  That is the whole purpose of  the\r\n\r\nMedisave  account - to save for the day when we  are  retired\r\n\r\nand  we  have  to pay for our hospitalisation.  When  we  are\r\n\r\nstill active, earning and have our own savings, we should use\r\n\r\nthese  to  pay for the other types of health screening  which\r\n\r\ndifferent  people want to undergo, and reserve  the  Medisave\r\n\r\naccounts for hospitalisation in our old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

Therefore, may  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Health whether he  will  facilitate  more\r\n\r\npeople  to  go for early detection by allowing  them  to  use\r\n\r\ntheir Medisave?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do not dispute the number of people\r\n\r\nwho  died  through  cancer.  People also  die  through  heart\r\n\r\ndisease,  strokes and many other causes.   The  approach  is,\r\n\r\nreally,  for effective mass screening, we do encourage.   For\r\n\r\nmammography, we have it in our polyclinics, and we  subsidise\r\n\r\nit up to 50%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think cost is the main deterrent in people\r\n\r\ncoming   forward   for   screening.    We   have   run   free\r\n\r\nmammographies, and the take-up rate is still very low.  So it\r\n\r\nis a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhole  process  of  education  and  getting  people  to  come\r\n\r\nforward.  Cost is not the key issue here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forms of health screening, where there is evidence\r\n\r\nthat  they are effective, we would do so.  Colorectal  cancer\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the  key  cancer killers in Singapore.   We  are\r\n\r\nlooking at other tests, not necessarily scoping, as a way  of\r\n\r\ndoing some kind of screening.  We are still in the process of\r\n\r\nevaluating the efficacy of such tests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would urge against a trigger-happy use of our\r\n\r\nMedisave.    Medisave   should  be   largely   utilised   for\r\n\r\nhospitalisation episodes in the later stages of our life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether it is\r\n\r\ncorrect  to say that mammography in the polyclinics  is  only\r\n\r\napplicable  to women aged 50 years and above on demand,  that\r\n\r\nthere is no population screening programme and there is  also\r\n\r\na  co-payment  fee of $50 for each screening?  But  since  an\r\n\r\naverage of three women are diagnosed with breast cancer, half\r\n\r\nof  them are below 50 years of age, and that breast cancer is\r\n\r\ncurable if detected early, should not the Minister facilitate\r\n\r\nmore women to go for early screening and save lives?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We have to use our Medisave\r\n\r\ncarefully.

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  beg  to  move, \"That the Bill be now read  a  Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to modify provisions in the Patents\r\n\r\nAct  concerning  the  regulation  of  patent  agents  and  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a number of minor amendments to streamline  patent\r\n\r\nadministration and strengthen the patent legal framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would touch on the modifications of patent\r\n\r\nagents provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 14 seeks to amend sections 104 and 105 of\r\n\r\nthe  Patents  Act  to  improve the provisions  governing  the\r\n\r\nregulation of patent agents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Sir, that when the Patents Act was\r\n\r\nbrought  into force in 1995, we delayed the entry into  force\r\n\r\nof  sections 104 and 105, in so far as they relate to  patent\r\n\r\nagents.  The reason for that was that we wanted to allow time\r\n\r\nfor fledgling patent regime to mature before starting our own\r\n\r\npatent  agent  profession.  More than  five  years  have  now\r\n\r\npassed  since  Singapore first had our own indigenous  patent\r\n\r\nregime.   I  think  the time is now right to  start  our  own\r\n\r\npatent agent profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, sections 104 and 105 will have to be modified\r\n\r\nbefore bringing them into operation.  We seek to modify those\r\n\r\nprovisions  after  the  corresponding provisions  in  the  UK\r\n\r\npatents law.  They place no restrictions on the categories of\r\n\r\npersons  who can provide patent agent services.  They  merely\r\n\r\nprohibit  persons who are not registered patent  agents  from\r\n\r\ndescribing themselves as patent agents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That situation, Sir, is peculiar to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAll  the  other  major  jurisdictions we  have  studied,  for\r\n\r\nexample,   the  United  States,  Australia,  France,   Japan,\r\n\r\nGermany,  and the European Patent Office have a more rigorous\r\n\r\nregulatory regime.  They all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrequire  a  person  to attain certain minimum  qualifications\r\n\r\nbefore  he  is  allowed to practise as a patent  agent.    We\r\n\r\nbelieve that Singapore should adopt a more rigorous system of\r\n\r\nregulation  in  order to promote our drive to be  a  regional\r\n\r\ndynamic intellectual property hub.  We should be mindful that\r\n\r\na  single high-profile mistake, made by an unqualified patent\r\n\r\nagent  whom  we have allowed to practise here,  could  easily\r\n\r\ndamage Singapore's reputation as an IPR hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised sections 104 and 105 therefore provide that\r\n\r\nonly  registered  patent agents and lawyers  are  allowed  to\r\n\r\nprovide  patent  agent services.  This model was  adopted  in\r\n\r\nAustralia.  Individuals will only be allowed to be registered\r\n\r\nas  patent agents if they meet the qualifying criteria set by\r\n\r\nthe Intellectual Property Office of Singapore or benefit from\r\n\r\nthe transitional provisions, all of which will be provided in\r\n\r\nthe  Rules.   With  this  amendment, only  registered  patent\r\n\r\nagents  will  be  allowed to hold themselves  out  as  patent\r\n\r\nagents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifying criteria to be set by the Intellectual\r\n\r\nProperty Office of Singapore will be similar to those in  the\r\n\r\nUnited States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan.  First of\r\n\r\nall,  applicants  will  have to attend a  16-week  foundation\r\n\r\ncourse in intellectual property law conducted by the National\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore Law Faculty and obtain  a  Graduate\r\n\r\nCertificate in IP Law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they will have to undergo a one-year\r\n\r\ninternship  programme under the supervision of  a  prescribed\r\n\r\nregistered   patent  agent.   The  Asian   Patent   Attorneys\r\n\r\nAssociation,   International   Federation   of   Intellectual\r\n\r\nProperty  Attorneys (FICPI) and the Law Society of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  assist  in  the  securing of both  overseas  and  local\r\n\r\nplacements.  The National Science and Technology  Board  will\r\n\r\nassist  in  co-funding  the course fees  and  payment  of  an\r\n\r\nallowance  to  the  applicants  during  internship  (if   the\r\n\r\napplicant  is co-sponsored by a corporate body), through  its\r\n\r\nManpower   Upgrading  for  Science  and   Technology   (MUST)\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the applicants will have to pass a qualifying\r\n\r\nexamination  set  by  the  Intellectual  Property  Office  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Provisions  would be  put  in  place  to  enable\r\n\r\nflexibility in meeting certain registration requirements such\r\n\r\nas  waivers of certain components, courses, as are adopted in\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards transitional arrangements for IP lawyers\r\n\r\ncurrently practising as patent agents, some lawyers today are\r\n\r\nalready using the term \"patent agent\" to describe themselves.\r\n\r\nAs  such,  provisions  will be made in  the  rules  to  allow\r\n\r\nlawyers  who  currently  have an active  patent  practice  to\r\n\r\nregister  themselves as patent agents, without having  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough the qualifying examinations.  This approach has  been\r\n\r\nworked  out in consultation with the Law Society of Singapore\r\n\r\nand   the   Asian  Patent  Attorneys  Association  (Singapore\r\n\r\nChapter).  But we have to be satisfied that they indeed  have\r\n\r\nhad an active patent practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards rights of audience, clause 13(a) of the Bill\r\n\r\nwill  amend  section  94(1) to provide that  only  registered\r\n\r\npatent   agents   and  lawyers  may  represent   parties   in\r\n\r\nproceedings before the Registrar of Patents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13(c) will amend section 94(2) to provide that\r\n\r\nonly  lawyers  may represent parties in an  appeal  from  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar to the High Court.  The current section 94(2) would\r\n\r\nhave  allowed  registered patent agents to appear  in  Court.\r\n\r\nBut  then this again is a provision adopted from the UK  law.\r\n\r\nIn  the  United Kingdom, this provision posed no difficulties\r\n\r\nas they have a specialised Patents Court.  Our system is more\r\n\r\nin   line  with  that  of  Australia,  where  there  are   no\r\n\r\nspecialised  patents courts, and thus no  special  rights  of\r\n\r\naudience  in  the courts for patent agents.   Let  me  stress\r\n\r\nthat  no accrued rights are affected by this change as  there\r\n\r\nare as yet no registered patent agents in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on other minor amendments, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as regards the removal of dependency on a patent\r\n\r\nbeing in force in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, section 36(4) provides for rules that require\r\n\r\nthe  submissions of renewals of patents registered under  the\r\n\r\nrepealed  Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act,  to  be\r\n\r\naccompanied  by  a  statutory  declaration  that  the  patent\r\n\r\nremains  in  force  or  has not been revoked  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom.  We are removing this restriction as the renewal  of\r\n\r\na  Singapore patent, in our view, should not be dependent  on\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  in  force  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  a\r\n\r\nproprietor  should be free to maintain his Singapore  patent.\r\n\r\nThis is provided in clause 8(b).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, section 116(3) is a transitional provision that\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the  continued validity of patents  previously\r\n\r\nregistered under the repealed Registration of United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nPatents  Act,  as long as the patent is not  revoked  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom.  We are similarly removing this condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Bill also includes amendments that\r\n\r\nwill  modify  certain  procedural  requirements  relating  to\r\n\r\napplications   and   grants   of  patents,   facilitate   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  an  electronic patent  register  and  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of information in an electronic environment,  and\r\n\r\ndispense  with the need to gazette new entrants to the  Paris\r\n\r\nConvention and WTO as convention countries.  It also  extends\r\n\r\nthe  protection  of visiting aircraft and ships  from  patent\r\n\r\ninfringement  proceedings  to ships  and  aircraft  from  WTO\r\n\r\ncountries,  and will remove doubts concerning the  Minister's\r\n\r\nrule-making powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise to speak in support of this Bill,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nfurther  step in building the legal infrastructure  necessary\r\n\r\nto sustain a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House debated the setting up of the Intellectual\r\n\r\nProperty Office (IPOS) only in February.  Now we are  looking\r\n\r\nat   another  dimension  of  intellectual  property,  namely,\r\n\r\npatents.  In particular, this Bill seeks to regulate  further\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npatenting system in Singapore, which means the provision  for\r\n\r\na  register  of  patent  agents in  Singapore.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  legal  institution in an  economy  that  places  a\r\n\r\npremium on creativity and enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek clarifications on a couple of\r\n\r\nmatters  relating  to the registration of patent  agents  and\r\n\r\ntheir  practice.   First, if I read clause 14  correctly,  no\r\n\r\none,  individual, partner or director, can refer to  himself,\r\n\r\nthe partnership or the company respectively as a patent agent\r\n\r\nor patent attorney unless the individual, partner or director\r\n\r\nis  a registered patent agent.  Can the Minister confirm that\r\n\r\nthis is the position?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, would this mean that no lawyer or law firm can\r\n\r\nactually  say  that they are in the practice of  patent  law?\r\n\r\nClause 14 contains a new section 105(4) which describes  what\r\n\r\nthe  practice of a patent agent is.  This seems  to  describe\r\n\r\nalso  what  certain law firms currently are  doing  in  their\r\n\r\nintellectual property departments.  Can they continue  to  do\r\n\r\nso  if  they  do  not  have  a partner  or  director  who  is\r\n\r\nregistered  as  a  patent agent?  This  interpretation  could\r\n\r\ncause  immense problems for the well-established  law  firms,\r\n\r\nwhich  usually  employ foreign patent agents,  to  draft  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  parts  of  a  patent application.   Once  the  new\r\n\r\nprovisions come into force, will these firms still be able to\r\n\r\ncall  themselves as being in the practice of patent law?   If\r\n\r\nnot, would this not be regarded as a drawback to developing a\r\n\r\nstrong   legal   practice  in  patent  law  and   indeed   in\r\n\r\nintellectual property law?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I am also concerned that by employing\r\n\r\njust one registered patent agent as a partner or director,  a\r\n\r\nlaw  firm  can then immediately advertise itself as being  in\r\n\r\npatent law practice.  I am sure that we do not want law firms\r\n\r\nwho  are  not adequately equipped with intellectual  property\r\n\r\nlaw  expertise to elevate themselves into this lucrative  but\r\n\r\nspecialised practice of patent application.  I agree with the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  a  botched patent application  can  cause  an\r\n\r\ninventor  millions of dollars.  Should we then not look  very\r\n\r\nseriously at other criteria concerning this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmatter of who or what firm can be called properly patent  law\r\n\r\nagents or patent law attorneys?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am also troubled by the fact that in\r\n\r\nFebruary,  when we debated the IPOS Bill, there  was  then  a\r\n\r\nprovision  requiring  intellectual property  advisers  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered.   I  raised the concern then that this  might  be\r\n\r\nover  regulating and that the scope of that section  was  too\r\n\r\nwide.  Here, I wonder whether we are also drawing the correct\r\n\r\nline in specifying that a firm with a registered patent agent\r\n\r\nas  a partner can describe itself as being in the business of\r\n\r\npatent  law but not otherwise.  While I support the  Bill  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  I  hope that more attention would be paid  to  this\r\n\r\nissue.   I also hope that some attempt be made to rationalise\r\n\r\nthese   provisions  with  the  provision  in  the  IPOS   Act\r\n\r\nconcerning  intellectual  property  advisers.   Otherwise  we\r\n\r\nshall  be  requiring  multiple registrations.   For  example,\r\n\r\nlawyers who want to be in patent law practice, they may  have\r\n\r\nto  register as intellectual property advisers, patent agents\r\n\r\nand,  of  course, advocates and solicitors.  Is  this  really\r\n\r\nwhat we intend?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would be prepared to look into\r\n\r\nthe  prospect of future amendments, if needed.  And  on  that\r\n\r\nnote, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank Prof. Chin for supporting\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.   He has raised a few questions which  I  have  to\r\n\r\nclarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain the present situation and what the\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  to do.  Under the present situation, any  lawyer\r\n\r\nand  any  law  firm  can  advise on  patent  law  and  patent\r\n\r\napplication process.  Any lawyer and law firm, at the moment,\r\n\r\ncan  hold  himself and the firm as a patent agent.  What  the\r\n\r\namendment  seeks  to do is to restrict the instances  of  any\r\n\r\nlawyer  or  law firm holding themselves out as  a  registered\r\n\r\npatent  agent.  But we will not prevent a law firm or  lawyer\r\n\r\nfrom  continuing to be engaged in the practice of patent law.\r\n\r\nI will make that overall clarification first.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I will turn to his specific question. First, he\r\n\r\nasked  whether he has read clause 14 correctly, ie,  no  one,\r\n\r\nindividual,  partner or director, can refer to himself  as  a\r\n\r\npatent  agent  unless the individual is a  registered  patent\r\n\r\nagent or the firm has at least one partner or director  as  a\r\n\r\nregistered patent agent.  Indeed, that is so, and his reading\r\n\r\nof it is correct.  But Prof. Chin is not correct when he goes\r\n\r\non  to extrapolate from this that this means that a law  firm\r\n\r\nfrom now onwards will not be able to say that they are in the\r\n\r\npractice  of patent law.  This is incorrect, because  lawyers\r\n\r\nand  law firms can continue to be engaged in the practice  of\r\n\r\npatent law.  In fact, I would say that they will even be able\r\n\r\nto  advertise  the fact that they can advise on  patent  law.\r\n\r\nWhat  they  cannot  do  is to say that they  are   registered\r\n\r\npatent  agents or firm of patent agents.  Let me  stress  why\r\n\r\nthis  is  important because we do not want the public  to  be\r\n\r\nconfused and to be under the impression that partners in  the\r\n\r\nfirm  have  gone through this rigorous qualification  process\r\n\r\nand  have  obtained  the qualifications to become  registered\r\n\r\npatent agents when they are not.  This position that we  have\r\n\r\nin  this  amending Bill has, in fact, been adopted  from  the\r\n\r\nmodel in Australia, and it has worked well there.   I am told\r\n\r\nthat  it  has  not raised any problems concerning  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin, in a sense, in his comments, has expressed\r\n\r\nconcern  whether the provisions are too strict.  And  in  the\r\n\r\nclosing  part  of what he said expressed concern  whether  it\r\n\r\nwould be too wide, that illustrates the problem which we have\r\n\r\nto  attend to.  In the present model, any lawyer can practise\r\n\r\npatent  law.  Any lawyer can hold himself out as a registered\r\n\r\npatent agent.  Sections 104 and 105, which we are now seeking\r\n\r\nto  amend,  as  they stand, would require a  law  firm  or  a\r\n\r\ncompany  to have every one of the partners and every  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  directors to be a registered patent agent, which I think\r\n\r\nis  too strict.  So, what we are seeking to do is to say that\r\n\r\nat  least one of the partners ought to be a registered patent\r\n\r\nagent.   I think this is a reasonable balance because,  in  a\r\n\r\nlaw  firm,  you may have many other partners being conversant\r\n\r\nand competent in different areas.  And,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  I said, this practice has worked well in Australia and  I\r\n\r\nthink it ought to work well for our purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Chin has expressed concern over the\r\n\r\npossibility of over regulation.  I hope that, to some extent,\r\n\r\nI  have  allayed that concern because, partly, it stems  from\r\n\r\nhis  interpretation  of the provisions that  it  may  prevent\r\n\r\nlawyers from engaging in the practice of patent law.  But  he\r\n\r\nalso  based  his concern on the IPOS Bill when he  said  that\r\n\r\nthere   was  a  provision  requiring  intellectual   property\r\n\r\nadvisers  to  be registered.  I think Prof. Chin  might  have\r\n\r\nmisinterpreted the provisions in the IPOS Bill, because there\r\n\r\nis  no provision which requires IP advisers to be registered.\r\n\r\nWhat he might be thinking about is the enabling provision  in\r\n\r\nthe  IPOS Bill which at some time in the future, if and  when\r\n\r\nthe  situation requires, would enable the statutory board  to\r\n\r\nbring  about a situation of registration.  But there  is,  as\r\n\r\nsuch,  no requirement now under the law for an IP adviser  to\r\n\r\nbe  registered,  and  we  explained in  this  House  why  the\r\n\r\nsituations can arise where the enabling provision might  have\r\n\r\nto  be  invoked.  So his concern that there may  be  multiple\r\n\r\nregistrations is, in fact, not the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have explained all the concerns of Prof.\r\n\r\nChin  and  I  am  glad that he has noted that  there  can  be\r\n\r\nserious consequences if persons who are not qualified to  act\r\n\r\nas  registered patent agents were to do so and in the  course\r\n\r\nof doing so, commit a serious mistake.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  his  clarifications.  I would just like to confirm  that\r\n\r\neven under the Bill, if passed and brought into force, a  law\r\n\r\nfirm  can  therefore still engage in the practice  of  patent\r\n\r\nlaw.   But  do I understand him to say that they  could  also\r\n\r\nadvertise themselves as being in the practice of patent  law,\r\n\r\neven  if they do not have any partner registered as a  patent\r\n\r\nagent?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, perhaps I should be a bit more\r\n\r\ncircumspect  in talking about law firms advertising,  because\r\n\r\nthat must be dealt with by the profession, as to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe circumstances in which law firms can advertise and so on.\r\n\r\nBut  as far as this Bill is concerned, it does not prevent  a\r\n\r\nlawyer  or  an advocate and solicitor from practising  patent\r\n\r\nlaw.  And perhaps if you look at the bottom of page 6 of  the\r\n\r\nBill, new section 105(1) says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An individual shall not carry on a business, practise\r\n\r\nor  act  as  a patent agent unless he is a registered  patent\r\n\r\nagent,  or an advocate and solicitor, [this is the key point]\r\n\r\n.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you look at page 7, paragraph (4)(c) which says, \"giving\r\n\r\nadvice  ..  about the validity, or infringement, of patents.\"\r\n\r\nNew section 105(1) deals with the situation of  practising as\r\n\r\na  patent  agent.   New section 105(5) is a  provision  which\r\n\r\ndeals  with holding oneself out as a registered patent agent.\r\n\r\nIt says:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n     'An individual shall not  -\r\n\r\n      (b)   in  the  course of a business otherwise  describe\r\n\r\nhimself,  hold himself out or permit himself to be  described\r\n\r\nor held out as a \"patent agent\",'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  an  interplay of these different provisions  that\r\n\r\nbrought about the position that I have described in my answer\r\n\r\nto his question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Prof. S.

Our\r\n\r\nelectoral processes also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed to be updated to take into account new developments such\r\n\r\nas  the  Internet.   This  Bill proposes  amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Elections Act to, firstly, regulate  political\r\n\r\ncampaigning   on   the  Internet;  secondly,   prohibit   the\r\n\r\npublication  during the election period  of  the  results  of\r\n\r\nopinion surveys on how electors intend to vote; and, thirdly,\r\n\r\ndisallow a person from contesting simultaneously in more than\r\n\r\none constituency.  I will cover each of these issues in turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Internet Political Campaigning</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Election in 1997 took place under rules that\r\n\r\npredated the Internet and did not allow political parties  to\r\n\r\npost   election  materials  on  their  websites  during   the\r\n\r\ncampaign.   At  the  time,  few  people  had  access  to  the\r\n\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the five years since, the popularity of the Internet\r\n\r\nhas  grown  tremendously.  Singapore already has the  highest\r\n\r\nInternet penetration rate in Asia at 48%.  Broadband  access,\r\n\r\nwhich  currently  stands at around 90,000  subscribers,  will\r\n\r\nbecome even more widespread in a few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, contrary to what the media have been\r\n\r\nspeculating,  the Government has decided to  allow  political\r\n\r\ncampaigning on the Internet in the upcoming General Election.\r\n\r\nHowever,  a  free-for-all  Internet  campaigning  environment\r\n\r\nwithout  rules is not advisable.  The Internet is  a  double-edged   sword.    Whilst   it  facilitates   discussion   and\r\n\r\ncommunication,  the seriousness of political debates  may  be\r\n\r\ncluttered  by  noise,  mischief  or  frivolities  during  the\r\n\r\nelection period.  Worse, the anonymity in the Internet  opens\r\n\r\na  door  for surreptitious elements to mislead, distract  and\r\n\r\nconfuse  the public.  On the Internet, once a false story  or\r\n\r\nrumour is started, it is like water that has been spilt.   It\r\n\r\nis  almost  impossible to remedy matters, especially  in  the\r\n\r\nlimited period of an election campaign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always maintained that politics\r\n\r\nshould  be  based  on factual and objective  presentation  of\r\n\r\nissues, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreasoned  debate.   Regulations are  therefore  necessary  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  integrity of our electoral process,  and  guide\r\n\r\nresponsible use of the Internet during the elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the new provisions on Internet\r\n\r\ncampaigning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill inserts new sections 78A to 78E.\r\n\r\nSection  78A  will  empower the Minister to make  regulations\r\n\r\nconcerning  Internet \"election advertising\"  (as  defined  in\r\n\r\nclause 2) during the election period from the day the writ of\r\n\r\nelection  is  issued to the close of all polling stations  on\r\n\r\nPolling Day.  These regulations will apply to political party\r\n\r\nwebsites  and non-party political websites which are required\r\n\r\nto  be  registered with the Singapore Broadcasting  Authority\r\n\r\nunder  its  Class  Licence  Scheme.   The  regulations   will\r\n\r\nstipulate the features which these websites may contain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For party political websites, the allowable features\r\n\r\nwill include party posters and manifesto, candidate profiles,\r\n\r\nannouncements  of  party events, party  position  on  issues,\r\n\r\nmoderated  chats  and discussion forums.  However,  non-party\r\n\r\npolitical  sites  should not campaign  for  any  party.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  they should not display party banners or  candidate\r\n\r\nprofiles.  Such restrictions are necessary to ensure a  level\r\n\r\nplaying field and that political parties do not make  use  of\r\n\r\nnon-party political sites to circumvent the rules on election\r\n\r\ncampaigning,   including  accountability  for  all   election\r\n\r\nexpenses  and political donations.  The full list of Internet\r\n\r\nfeatures will be released when it is finalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 78B will prohibit new displays of, or\r\n\r\nchanges in, election advertising in all media on Polling Day.\r\n\r\nThis is in line with current rules to disallow campaigning on\r\n\r\nPolling Day.  This practice allows voters to reflect and vote\r\n\r\nin  an atmosphere free from new election advertising messages\r\n\r\non  Polling Day.  Section 78B, however, does not prohibit the\r\n\r\npublication  of any news or current affairs coverage  of  the\r\n\r\nelection in newspapers or in radio and television broadcasts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for contravening section 78A and 78B are,\r\n\r\nupon  conviction, a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor a term not exceeding 12 months or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>\"Election Survey\" and Exit Polls</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the issue of the impact of\r\n\r\nopinion polls on the electoral process and election outcomes.\r\n\r\nOpinion  polls or surveys often give the illusion  that  they\r\n\r\nreflect  public opinion on certain issues and  could  mislead\r\n\r\nthe  public.  Quick polls often use small sample  sizes,  bad\r\n\r\nquestion  design and improper sampling, leading to inaccurate\r\n\r\nor   slanted  results.   For  instance,  in  the  recent   US\r\n\r\nPresidential  Elections,  the early projections  of  election\r\n\r\nresults  by  the major media networks were faulty  and  might\r\n\r\nhave influenced the election outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet makes it easy for anyone to conduct a\r\n\r\nsurvey  online  without  proper controls,  often  leading  to\r\n\r\nmisleading  or  confusing results.   Let  me  cite  a  recent\r\n\r\nexample.   A  local website ran a poll on whether  the  death\r\n\r\npenalty  in  Singapore was supported. During the first  seven\r\n\r\ndays  of  the poll, some 83% of the respondents had voted  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  the  death penalty.  Within the next  four  days,\r\n\r\nhowever,  there was an about-turn resulting in  the  converse\r\n\r\nfinding  that  69% of the respondents were not in  favour  of\r\n\r\ncapital punishment.  How did such an about-turn occur?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opinion polls can also give rise to a \"horse-race\"\r\n\r\nmentality,  which  can  distract  voters  from  learning  the\r\n\r\ncandidates' qualifications and their positions on key issues.\r\n\r\nThis unhealthy preoccupation with survey results distorts and\r\n\r\ntrivialises  the  election process  and  the  seriousness  of\r\n\r\npurpose   of   a   General  Election.   Laws  governing   the\r\n\r\npublication of opinion poll results will need to  be  put  in\r\n\r\nplace to prevent this from occurring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 30 countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia have\r\n\r\nimposed  embargoes  on the publication  of  election  opinion\r\n\r\npolls  and  exit  polls prior to, and on, Polling  Day.   For\r\n\r\nexample, in Luxembourg, the embargo period is more than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n30  days, for Italy 28 days, Venezuela 15 days and France  14\r\n\r\ndays.  For Switzerland, Chile and Mexico, it is 7 days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill will insert a new section 78C to\r\n\r\nprohibit  the  publication of the results  of  any  \"election\r\n\r\nsurvey\" which is defined as an opinion survey of how electors\r\n\r\nwill  vote at an election in respect of any candidate,  group\r\n\r\nof  candidates,  political party or issue  identifiable  with\r\n\r\nthem.   This  embargo  will apply to all  media,  during  the\r\n\r\nelection period from the day of the issue of writ of election\r\n\r\nto Polling Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Act already prohibits the publication of\r\n\r\nexit  polls.   To remove any ambiguity, the new  section  78D\r\n\r\nexplicitly disallows the publication of exit poll results  in\r\n\r\nall media on Polling Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for contravening the new sections 78C and\r\n\r\n78D would be, upon conviction, a fine not exceeding $1,000 or\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Multiple nominations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now deal with clause 5 of the\r\n\r\nBill on the issue of multiple nominations in an election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the Act does not prohibit a person from\r\n\r\ncontesting in two or more constituencies in an election.   He\r\n\r\nmay  even be returned successfully in all the constituencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, Article 47 of the Constitution requires him to  give\r\n\r\nup  all but one seat, as it stipulates that one cannot  be  a\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament for more than one constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An election candidate must be committed to a\r\n\r\nconstituency when he contests there.  Since the candidate can\r\n\r\nonly  take  up  one  seat even if he wins in  more  than  one\r\n\r\nconstituency, there is no reason why he should be allowed  to\r\n\r\nstand for election in more than one constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing law dates back to 1947, when the Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative Council Elections Ordinance 1947 was enacted,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   has   its  origins  in  Victorian  England.    Multiple\r\n\r\ncandidatures  are disallowed in Australia,  New  Zealand,  UK\r\n\r\nlocal  elections and European Parliament elections.  As there\r\n\r\nis  no good reason for this provision to continue to exist in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the Government has decided to amend  the  Act  to\r\n\r\ndisallow multiple nominations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 inserts a new section 32A to deal with multiple\r\n\r\nnominations  at a general election or when two  or  more  by-elections  are being held at the same time.  The new  section\r\n\r\nprovides   that  if  a  candidate  does  not  withdraw   from\r\n\r\nnominations in all the electoral divisions for which  he  has\r\n\r\nbeen  nominated except one, he will have all his  nominations\r\n\r\ninvalidated  by  the  law.  If his  nomination  for  a  Group\r\n\r\nRepresentation  Constituency is invalidated,  the  nomination\r\n\r\nfor the rest of the group would also be invalidated unless it\r\n\r\ncan  quickly  file  a fresh nomination before  the  close  of\r\n\r\nnominations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to speak in support of the Bill.  With rapid advances in\r\n\r\ntechnology  and with one of the highest Internet penetrations\r\n\r\nin Asia, it has become increasingly more difficult to monitor\r\n\r\nand   control   political  activities  on  the  Internet   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  move by the Government  to  further  relax\r\n\r\nInternet  campaigning  based on a `positive  list'  approach,\r\n\r\nstipulating  contents which are allowed into political  sites\r\n\r\nduring  election  is  indeed a step in the  right  direction.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is  also  in line with our gradual  move  towards\r\n\r\nliberalisation of our censorship policies and the media as we\r\n\r\nbecome  a  more developed country.  We would recall that  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Election  in 1997, just four years  ago,  prohibited\r\n\r\npolitical  campaigning on the Internet.   This  amendment  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  a step forward.  I am sure in the years  to  come,\r\n\r\nthis  `positive list' will be extended to allow more contents\r\n\r\non the Internet during election campaigning.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill, while regulating political campaigning on\r\n\r\nthe  Internet, also prohibits the publication of voter intent\r\n\r\npolls during the elections.  I support this amendment as I am\r\n\r\nconvinced  that there is good reason for Singaporeans  to  be\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the potentially disruptive  impact  of  pre-election opinion polls.  There is no assurance of fairness in\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of such polls, which could cover anything  from\r\n\r\nspecific  issues  to  pure  speculation  on  the  outcome  of\r\n\r\nparticular  electoral  contests.  Hence,  there  is  a  grave\r\n\r\nconcern  that  such  polls  may be  cynically  structured  to\r\n\r\nproduce   desired  outcomes  for  promoters,  whose   primary\r\n\r\nmotivation  may  be to mislead, to misinform  and  to  unduly\r\n\r\ninfluence  the  election outcome.  The risk  is  particularly\r\n\r\nhigh  for  polls conducted on the Internet which, as  we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  may be rigged, or have a degree of participation  from\r\n\r\nindividuals  outside of Singapore who have their  own  agenda\r\n\r\nand may not necessarily have the interest of Singaporeans  at\r\n\r\nheart.   These  foreigners  will not  be  here  to  bear  the\r\n\r\nconsequences of their actions, should their actions  lead  to\r\n\r\nundesirable outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent, Sir, the fixation of opinion polls in\r\n\r\nother  countries, such as the USA on peripheral issues,  some\r\n\r\neven  bordering  on the frivolous and scandalous,  will  only\r\n\r\nconfuse the electorate who may inadvertently focus on  single\r\n\r\nissues,  instead of national issues, which are  crucial  when\r\n\r\nchoosing  a  government.   At  worst,  it  could  allow   the\r\n\r\nelectoral  proceedings and process in  Singapore,  which  has\r\n\r\nalways been conducted according to the highest standards,  to\r\n\r\nbe  trivialised  and be manipulated by parties  with  agendas\r\n\r\nthat may be inimical to the interest of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The over-reliance of such polls, which are of less\r\n\r\nrelevance  than  the  actual outcome of  electoral  contests,\r\n\r\ncould  undermine the legitimacy of the results and  discredit\r\n\r\nthe  well-regarded  system that we have  built  up  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.  Sir, one only has to look at the negative effects  in\r\n\r\nthe  last Presidential Election in the USA, for example, when\r\n\r\nthe international community congratulated the \"wrong\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPresident,  only to then have to retract and reinstate  their\r\n\r\nmessages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Sir, the legal restrictions on voter\r\n\r\nintent  polls during the election period is not new.  As  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  explained,  it  is  being  practised  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries  in Europe, the Americas and Asia.  This  amendment\r\n\r\nshould  therefore be viewed positively in this light, ie,  we\r\n\r\nare  aligning  our  laws  to be in  line  with  international\r\n\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the Bill, some critics have\r\n\r\ncomplained that the powers being legislated in this Bill  run\r\n\r\nanathema to Singapore's ambition to be a regional media  hub.\r\n\r\nI  beg  to disagree.  Responsible journalism has always  been\r\n\r\nheld  in  the  highest esteem by the end  consumer,  ie,  the\r\n\r\npublic.   I  am  convinced that both the  local  and  foreign\r\n\r\nbroadcasters  and  other  media players  in  Singapore  fully\r\n\r\nappreciate  the  fact  that responsible  reporting  does  not\r\n\r\nconstitute  censorship  or  restrain  their  obligations   to\r\n\r\nreport,  inform and educate.  What this Bill does is to  make\r\n\r\nit  clear and transparent where the goal posts lie, in  order\r\n\r\nfor them to operate effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, the Minister could perhaps comment or\r\n\r\ngive  an assurance to this House that the intentions  of  the\r\n\r\nBill have taken into consideration our overall ambition to be\r\n\r\na media hub.  This affirmation should greatly allay the fears\r\n\r\nand  worries of those, both local and foreign, whose business\r\n\r\nand  employment interests lie in the success of our media hub\r\n\r\nstrategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the enforcement of some of the specific\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill, I would like to raise the concern on\r\n\r\nwhether  in  the  way  the  Bill has been  drafted,  innocent\r\n\r\nbystanders will be criminally liable for offences under  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, I refer to clause 6 of the Bill which makes it\r\n\r\na corrupt practice for any person to publish on the Internet,\r\n\r\nany  election materials without identifying the name  of  the\r\n\r\nprinter,  the publisher and the person for whom or  at  whose\r\n\r\ndirection  the election advertising is published.  And  where\r\n\r\nany contravention\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noccurs,  the  printer as well as the person for whom  and  at\r\n\r\nwhose  direction  it  is  published shall  be  guilty  of  an\r\n\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the nature of the Internet, and the fact that\r\n\r\nsites  can be hosted on a world-wide basis, there is  no  way\r\n\r\nprinters  can  assure  themselves  that  someone,  somewhere,\r\n\r\nsometime  may  not post a message or host a  site  displaying\r\n\r\nelection  advertising  without their  authority  or  consent.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  organisations which are non political  in  nature\r\n\r\nmay not be able to prevent completely someone from picking up\r\n\r\nsomething   on  their  open  discussion  forums,  information\r\n\r\nlistings,  or  even hijacking their site and publishing  such\r\n\r\ninformation on their own political sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 78E of the Bill puts the onus on such persons\r\n\r\ncharged  with these offences, to prove that the contravention\r\n\r\nof  the  provision  arose  from  circumstances  beyond  their\r\n\r\ncontrol  and  indeed all reasonable steps and  due  diligence\r\n\r\nhave  been  taken to ensure that the contravention would  not\r\n\r\narise.  It is not clear then, and it is quite subjective what\r\n\r\nwould  be  \"reasonable steps\", since it is so  easy  in  this\r\n\r\ninformation age for abuse to be conducted without the consent\r\n\r\nor indeed the knowledge of the producers of such advertising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister therefore elaborate on how effective\r\n\r\ncan any enforcement take place when an event like this occurs\r\n\r\nand   how   innocent  parties  to  these  infringements   can\r\n\r\nadequately  be  assured  that they  will  not  be  prosecuted\r\n\r\nindiscriminately?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the last amendment to the Bill is to plug\r\n\r\na  loophole  in  our  law.   It disallows  a  candidate  from\r\n\r\ncontesting  simultaneously in more than one constituency.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with this amendment as, I think, it is impossible  for\r\n\r\nan  MP  to serve more than one constituency given the demands\r\n\r\nof  an  MP's work nowadays.  Indeed, this amendment  is  long\r\n\r\noverdue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I hope the Minister would address\r\n\r\nsome of the concerns I have raised in my speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I refer to\r\n\r\nclause 5 of the Bill.  I cannot understand why the Government\r\n\r\nwants  to  prohibit  multiple nominations.   As  it  is,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  already pegged the  election  deposit  at  a\r\n\r\nprohibitively  high  amount.  If a candidate  wants  to  risk\r\n\r\nlosing  his  deposit,  it should be  his  prerogative.   What\r\n\r\nhappens   if  multiple  nominations  are  allowed   and   the\r\n\r\ncandidates are returned to, say, three constituencies, either\r\n\r\nin  the  GRCs  or single seats?  If it is a GRC,  then  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  no  problem.  By-elections in any event  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  in  GRCs.  Therefore, there shall  always  be  other\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament in the GRC to look after his  ward  if\r\n\r\nthat  Member  is  busy looking after his other constituencies\r\n\r\nwhich  he  has been returned, or in the case of  Jalan  Besar\r\n\r\nGRC, the party that has won that constituency can always send\r\n\r\none  of  its  Members to be a caretaker MP there.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nsince  such  a precedent has been set up in Jalan Besar  GRC,\r\n\r\nthe  same  principle can be adopted for a candidate  who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  returned to multiple constituencies.  If he is too busy\r\n\r\nworking  in one or two of his constituencies, his  party  can\r\n\r\nalways delegate one of his party members to take care of  his\r\n\r\nward  in another constituency which he has won.  In the  case\r\n\r\nof a single seat constituency, the same can be repeated as in\r\n\r\nthe GRC.  The single member must run from one constituency to\r\n\r\nthe other constituency to take care of them.  If he is unable\r\n\r\nto do so, then his party will have to delegate one or more of\r\n\r\nits members to stand in for him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the PAP which has set the precedent of sending one\r\n\r\nof his party members to stand in for a colleague who has left\r\n\r\nParliament for whatever reason.  I cannot see why a candidate\r\n\r\nwho has been elected to multiple constituencies cannot do the\r\n\r\nsame  if  voters in those constituencies are willing to  vote\r\n\r\nfor  him.   Voters  must be given a free  choice  to  vote  a\r\n\r\ncandidate they like.  The Government should not legislatively\r\n\r\ndeprive them of their right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I wish to speak on the other amendments in the\r\n\r\nBill.   I also cannot understand why the Government,  on  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  spends millions of dollars to promote IT  in  the\r\n\r\nschools and ask workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  upgrade their skills but, on the other hand, its  use  in\r\n\r\nrelation to elections at election time, in some instances, is\r\n\r\nprohibited.  As long as we know who are the people behind the\r\n\r\npublication    advertising   the   poll    findings,    other\r\n\r\nadvertisements, or news, I think it should be all right.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment should allow the people of Singapore to  grow  up,\r\n\r\nthink  for  themselves and make their own  decisions.   Those\r\n\r\npublications should be allowed as long as we can identify and\r\n\r\ncatch  them, if necessary, the persons responsible for  those\r\n\r\npublications  and  make  them accountable  for  their  libel,\r\n\r\nsedition, or other disseminated matters which are criminal in\r\n\r\nnature.   The  Government should give  them  the  freedom  to\r\n\r\npublish,  even  if  the PAP risks losing a few  parliamentary\r\n\r\nseats  at  the  polls.   The  bigger  issue  of  freedom   of\r\n\r\npublication  and  allowing our citizens to mature  is  surely\r\n\r\nmore  important for nation building than the party  losing  a\r\n\r\nfew parliamentary seats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, for years now, the Opposition has been\r\n\r\nsuffering  the problem, that the ruling party is  afraid  of,\r\n\r\nthat  is, voters at the last moment may be influenced not  to\r\n\r\nvote  for  the  Opposition.   The  local  press,  during  the\r\n\r\nelectioneering period and especially on Polling  Day,  nearly\r\n\r\nalways  publishes sensational headlines which are detrimental\r\n\r\nto the Opposition, so much so that the Opposition has to tell\r\n\r\nthe voters not to read the newspapers on Polling Day, knowing\r\n\r\nthat the headlines in those papers will be devastating to the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  The Opposition is certain that the ruling  party\r\n\r\nis  aware that, during election time, the local press  almost\r\n\r\nalways  gives a bad press to the Opposition.  Yet  it  allows\r\n\r\nthe  local press to carry on that practice simply because  it\r\n\r\nknows that it is good for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My query to the Minister is: will the present amendments\r\n\r\nto the Parliamentary Elections Act cover local press as well?\r\n\r\nTo  me, it appears to be so under clause 2 of the Bill.  Will\r\n\r\nthe Minister please clarify?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I rise to speak in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the Bill.  This Bill will have a great impact  in\r\n\r\nshaping the way in which we conduct elections in an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninformation    technology   environment.    In    cyberspace,\r\n\r\nindividuals  are empowered to communicate their thoughts  and\r\n\r\nideas to others quickly and extensively.  It is said that the\r\n\r\npen  is  mightier than the sword, but I have no doubt at  all\r\n\r\nthat  the  computer keyboard is the mightiest  of  them  all.\r\n\r\nThis  would  be more apparent in the context of  an  election\r\n\r\ncampaign when claim and counter-claim can be made as fast  as\r\n\r\none can think and type.  Political exchanges taking place  in\r\n\r\nthe  physical  world can be easily dwarfed  by  those  taking\r\n\r\nplace in cyberspace.  Individuals and parties can debate  and\r\n\r\ncampaign to their hearts' content, literally sitting in their\r\n\r\nrooms or offices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill and the regulations will eventually provide\r\n\r\nthe   rules  of  engagement  for  political  campaigning   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is important therefore that they are  seen  to\r\n\r\nbe  fair  to  all  parties.  I also believe strongly  in  the\r\n\r\nMinister's statement that politics should be based on factual\r\n\r\nand objective presentation of issues and reasoned debate.  It\r\n\r\ndoes  not follow of course that such a situation cannot arise\r\n\r\nin  a  cyberspace environment.  The real question is: if left\r\n\r\nunregulated, will an undesirable situation arise?   By  which\r\n\r\nis  meant  a  situation where voters are not  able  to  judge\r\n\r\nobjectively what is true and what is not.  One may argue, for\r\n\r\nexample, that the laws of defamation and other forms of  mis-statement  would be available to control such  excesses  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  further regulation would not  be  necessary.   Be\r\n\r\nthat as it may, the Bill opts for control through regulation,\r\n\r\nand it is to this approach that I now turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that we are debating this Bill without\r\n\r\nhaving  a complete idea as to what sort of features or  items\r\n\r\nwould  be  allowed  on  a  political website.   The  Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned  just  now  that a full list of  features  will  be\r\n\r\nreleased  when they are finalised.  Firstly, may  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister when we can expect to see such regulations  and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, the list?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister what is the\r\n\r\nextent  to  which  individuals, as  distinct  from  political\r\n\r\nparties, can be involved in Internet discussions on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolitical issues?  Clause 6 contains a provision that  allows\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  communicate  with  each  other  \"on  a  non-commercial  basis\".   This  is, to  me,  a  puzzling  phrase.\r\n\r\nUnless  these  individuals are in the business  of  political\r\n\r\nlobbying,  I  should have thought that all would  communicate\r\n\r\npolitical views on a non-commercial basis.  Even in the  case\r\n\r\nof a candidate writing to a prospective voter, I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  he  would be acting in a commercial capacity.  It  must\r\n\r\nsurely  be in the public interest that candidates and  voters\r\n\r\nshould  be able to communicate with each other without  being\r\n\r\nregarded as being in a commercial capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only type of person that would be caught would\r\n\r\nbe  those employed by politicians to answer email or  respond\r\n\r\nto  messages, presumably because he is doing so in the course\r\n\r\nof  his  employment and, therefore, can be regarded as acting\r\n\r\ncommercially.  If this is correct, and I do not say  that  it\r\n\r\nis, I wonder whether this is actually Parliament's intention.\r\n\r\nI  should  have thought that the objective would be  to  stop\r\n\r\ncommercial  posters using the Internet to bombard individuals\r\n\r\nwith political advertisements.  If so, I am not sure that the\r\n\r\nlegislation,  as  drafted, would achieve in the  purpose  for\r\n\r\nrestricting such people from doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know whether in the case of a\r\n\r\npolitical  website, is it permissible for such a  website  to\r\n\r\nhost  a  page where supporters can, for example,  send  their\r\n\r\nmessages  of  support for the party or its  policies?   Would\r\n\r\nindividuals  doing so be regarded as infringing  regulations,\r\n\r\nexisting  or  proposed?   I  ask  this  because,  again,  the\r\n\r\namendment exempting individuals from liability only speaks of\r\n\r\ncommunicating between individuals, not between individual and\r\n\r\npolitical  party,  for example.  So I hope the  Minister  can\r\n\r\nclarify this particular point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister will make it very clear to\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean that the regulations are not  intended  to\r\n\r\nstifle  political comment, especially during  election  time.\r\n\r\nThat would be inimical to the democratic process that we  are\r\n\r\nfostering, and I believe that it would also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe against the idea of active citizenry, because the exercise\r\n\r\nof political judgement and political will is, if one may call\r\n\r\nit,  one of the fundamental attributes of exercising actively\r\n\r\none's citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that there must be some regulation so that the\r\n\r\nstated  objective of having a clean and fair election can  be\r\n\r\nmaintained, as it has been in the past.  But I do  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  regulations will be seen to be clear and transparent  to\r\n\r\nall parties concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I express strong support for the\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  exit  polls and the  like.   I  have  often\r\n\r\nwondered why voters would be swayed simply by numbers  rather\r\n\r\nthan issues, so I think this is indeed a very proper thing to\r\n\r\nexclude from the political campaign period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nglad  that  the  Government has decided  to  allow  political\r\n\r\ncampaigning  on  the  Internet, albeit  with  certain  ground\r\n\r\nrules.  This should certainly allay the fear of some that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  ban  the  use of  Internet  for  political\r\n\r\ncampaigns.   Whilst  we recognise the  Internet  as  an  easy\r\n\r\nmedium  to  reach many people and for many people  to  access\r\n\r\ninformation  easily, we must also concede that  the  Internet\r\n\r\nwill be abused by some.  Rumours, gossips and unsubstantiated\r\n\r\nstories can also be relayed instantaneously, which may  cause\r\n\r\nirreparable damage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed section 78A empowers the Minister to make\r\n\r\nregulations governing non-printed election advertising in  an\r\n\r\nelection  period and election advertising on the Internet  in\r\n\r\nan  election  period  by  political  parties,  candidates  or\r\n\r\npersons.   It  states  that the Minister would  regulate  the\r\n\r\nInternet advertising by prescribing the features that must or\r\n\r\nmust not appear in any election advertising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Minister, in his speech,\r\n\r\nhas chosen to use the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"positive  list\" approach in making these regulations  as  it\r\n\r\nwould  provide clear guidelines to those involved on what  is\r\n\r\npermissible  for  election political campaigning.   It  would\r\n\r\nalso  help  set  clear  markers to  other  non-political  web\r\n\r\nmasters  on what is legal and illegal under the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at first glance, it appears to be a rational move\r\n\r\nin  the  light  of the fact that the use of the Internet  for\r\n\r\npolitical  purpose is something new here  and  also  in  many\r\n\r\nother countries.  Some skeptics, however, claim that it is an\r\n\r\nuphill  battle  to  try to control the use  of  the  Internet\r\n\r\nduring  election  periods because of the sheer  multitude  of\r\n\r\nusers  and  also  by  the  cross-border  nature  of  Internet\r\n\r\ntraffic.   This raises the interesting question how  overseas\r\n\r\nwebsites  which  engage  in local political  activity  during\r\n\r\nelection periods will be monitored and censured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I recall, very recently, when an election took\r\n\r\nplace  in  a neighbouring country, a lot of foreign  websites\r\n\r\nwere  sited  overseas  and  a lot  of  political  discussions\r\n\r\ninvolving  this  particular  country's  politics   were   all\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  these overseas websites.   So  this  certainly\r\n\r\nposes  a  challenge to the proposed amendments, and I  wonder\r\n\r\nhow the Minister would tackle this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate that not doing anything is also\r\n\r\nsomething  no  responsible government can afford  to  do.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister for some clarification on  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  Internet by political parties,  candidates  and\r\n\r\nagents during the election period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, would the positive list allow mass emails\r\n\r\nby these political parties' candidates or agents to those who\r\n\r\nhave  registered themselves with these political parties  and\r\n\r\nare  willing  to  receive them, ie, those who  are  willingly\r\n\r\nsubmitting  their  emails  to  these  political  parties  and\r\n\r\ncandidates  and  are willing to receive these  emails?   Will\r\n\r\nthey be subject to these regulations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can these individuals send these emails\r\n\r\ncontaining   political  information  or   advertisements   to\r\n\r\nfriends, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill they end up in breach of these regulations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the proposed section 78B seems only to allow\r\n\r\nthe  sending of email by individuals to other individuals  of\r\n\r\nhis  own  political  views.   If  one  endorses  the  written\r\n\r\nviewpoint of candidates or a political party and states  that\r\n\r\nit  is  also his viewpoint, will it also be in breach of  the\r\n\r\nproposed regulations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, how are individual emails going to be\r\n\r\nmonitored if there are thousands, if not millions, of  emails\r\n\r\nbeing  sent  around?   Can  the monitoring  be  done  without\r\n\r\nintruding into the privacy of individuals?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, Sir, are bulletin boards, chat rooms and other\r\n\r\nwebsites  that  discuss political matters permissible  during\r\n\r\nthe election period?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the topic of election polls and\r\n\r\nexit  polls.  Sir, it is common in many countries,  prior  to\r\n\r\nthe  closing of voting, for opinion polls to be conducted  by\r\n\r\ndifferent  organisations.  The results of such opinion  polls\r\n\r\nare published in newspapers, magazines and other periodicals,\r\n\r\nand  sometimes telecast or broadcast on the electronic media.\r\n\r\nThe  dissemination of such results of opinion polls  receives\r\n\r\nwide  publicity  and  coverage in the  print  and  electronic\r\n\r\nmedia,  and  such dissemination, particularly on the  eve  of\r\n\r\npolls, has the potential to influence the electors when  they\r\n\r\nare in the process of making up their minds to vote or not to\r\n\r\nvote for a certain political party or candidate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the methodology followed by different organisations\r\n\r\nconducting  such  opinion polls varies from  organisation  to\r\n\r\norganisation   or   the  agencies  conducting   such   polls.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the sample size of the electorate covered by  such\r\n\r\npolls  and  geographic  spread of  the  survey  also  differs\r\n\r\nsubstantially in each case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from opinion polls, exit polls are also\r\n\r\nconducted  by some organisations on the days of polls.   Many\r\n\r\nwould  agree  that  opinion  polls,  the  way  the  same  are\r\n\r\nconducted, are not scientific.  There is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsiderable  bias,  in the size and  nature  of  the  sample\r\n\r\ndrawn,  to  make  such  an opinion  poll  and  they  tend  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  the voters in an unbecoming manner.  It is  common\r\n\r\nfact  that  many  of  the  polls are motivated  and  are  not\r\n\r\nimpartial,  because of the known leanings  or  prejudices  of\r\n\r\nsome  of the organisations conducting such polls, towards  or\r\n\r\nagainst certain political parties and/or their leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have carefully looked into the existing\r\n\r\nlegislation  covering  the  subject  in  many  countries.   I\r\n\r\nobserve  that  in  many  states, eg, Canada,  France,  Italy,\r\n\r\nPoland,    Turkey,   Argentina,   Brazil,   Colombia,    etc,\r\n\r\nrestrictions in one way or another are placed on the  conduct\r\n\r\nof  opinion polls and exit polls.  For example, the  Canadian\r\n\r\nElections Act peremptorily prohibits the publication  of  any\r\n\r\nresults  of  any  opinion  poll two days  before  the  voting\r\n\r\nbegins.   Similarly, the Italian Decree Law of 18th  November\r\n\r\n1995,  entitled \"Urgent Provisions for Equal  Access  to  the\r\n\r\nMedia during Electoral and Referendum Period\" provides that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Starting from the 20th day before the elections till\r\n\r\nthe  closing  date of voting, it is forbidden to  publish  or\r\n\r\ncirculate  the  results of exit polls, even if  such  surveys\r\n\r\nwere carried out before the above mentioned period.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, the provisions of our\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Elections Act, namely,  sections  80  and  81,\r\n\r\ndeserve   to  be  specially  noted.   Section  80   prohibits\r\n\r\ncanvassing  in  any  manner  on  polling  day.   Section   81\r\n\r\nprohibits anyone from dissuading any person from voting at an\r\n\r\nelection from the day of nomination and polling day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing law is a clear manifestation of\r\n\r\nrecognition of ground reality by Parliament in its collective\r\n\r\nwisdom that the voter needs a period before the completion of\r\n\r\nthe  poll,  during  which he should not be disturbed  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  weighing  the merits and demerits  of  political\r\n\r\nparties  and contesting candidates in the electoral fray,  so\r\n\r\nthat he can absorb what he has heard or witnessed during  the\r\n\r\nelection period in a tranquil and balanced frame of mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, viewed in the light of the above statutory\r\n\r\nrestrictions,  allowing  results of opinion  polls  and  exit\r\n\r\npolls to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublished  on the eve of polls or during the polling  process\r\n\r\nwould  be a deleterious intrusion into the mind of the voter,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  already  prohibited by law  during  the  aforesaid\r\n\r\nperiod of 24 hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a worldwide study by Nils Rohme on the Freedom\r\n\r\nTo  Publish  Opinion Polls in 1997, which was highlighted  in\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's speech, it was reported that  30  of  the  78\r\n\r\ncountries covered in the survey applied legal restrictions on\r\n\r\nthe  publication of public opinion surveys, mostly comprising\r\n\r\nan  embargo prior to general elections.  It extends  anywhere\r\n\r\nfrom one day in some and up to six weeks in the case of South\r\n\r\nAfrica.  It is also clear from the survey that many countries\r\n\r\nin  the world were not covered in the survey because they  do\r\n\r\nnot  have regulations governing opinion polls because opinion\r\n\r\npolls do not exist or are very new in these countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am comforted by the fact that in introducing this\r\n\r\npiece   of  legislation  we  are  in  the  company  of   many\r\n\r\nprogressive   countries  in  the  western  world   who   have\r\n\r\nrecognised the weaknesses and abuse of opinion polls  in  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic process and have placed controls on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In supporting the Bill, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor three clarifications in this area:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is the position if an election survey is\r\n\r\ndone  and  the results of the survey are put up on a  website\r\n\r\nbefore the issue of the writ of elections?  Is the person  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of the website obliged to remove the details  of  the\r\n\r\nsurvey during the election period?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, will political parties, candidates and the\r\n\r\nmedia be allowed to conduct opinion polls using their website\r\n\r\nduring  the election period which is not disseminated to  the\r\n\r\npublic, and whether, in the political list which is to be put\r\n\r\nup for political parties and candidates to observe, they will\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to conduct opinion polls for their  own  use  or\r\n\r\nwhich  they may want to use after the election is  over,  and\r\n\r\nthis includes the media?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, what action will be taken against foreign\r\n\r\nparties  who  conduct  opinion polls  and  publish  the  same\r\n\r\noverseas  during  an election period, as  criminal  laws  are\r\n\r\nterritorial  in  nature,  and  whether  this  law   has   any\r\n\r\nextraterritorial implications?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister can comment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  purpose of this Amendment Bill is to  enhance  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  form and manner of election campaigning  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  opposition parties and their supporters could  not\r\n\r\nmake use of the new technology for effective publicity during\r\n\r\nthe  election period, to suppress the limited space where the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties have to communicate with the masses,  and\r\n\r\nthereby reducing the influence of the opposition parties  and\r\n\r\ntheir chances of winning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Minister mentioned a moment ago in his\r\n\r\nSecond Reading speech that this amendment has allowed the use\r\n\r\nof  Internet  during elections, this is,  however,  only  the\r\n\r\ncosmetic  surface of the Bill.  What we should pay  attention\r\n\r\nto   is   that   this   Amendment  Bill  redefines   election\r\n\r\nadvertising.  Under clause 2 of the Amendment Bill,  election\r\n\r\nadvertising is defined as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Election advertising means any poster, banner, notice,\r\n\r\ncircular,  handbill, illustration, article, advertisement  or\r\n\r\nother material that can reasonably be regarded as intended to\r\n\r\npromote or procure the electoral success at any election  for\r\n\r\none  or  more  identifiable political parties, candidates  or\r\n\r\ngroups  of candidates, . and such material shall be  election\r\n\r\nadvertising  even  though it can reasonably  be  regarded  as\r\n\r\nintended to achieve any other purpose as well and even though\r\n\r\nit does not expressly mention the name of any political party\r\n\r\nor candidate.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this definition, any expression or article, so\r\n\r\nlong  as  it  is related to the election, can be regarded  as\r\n\r\nelection  advertising and comes under  the  control  of  this\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill, if this article or expression is published on\r\n\r\nthe  Internet.  The webmaster of the site can even be  fined.\r\n\r\nFor  example, if someone puts on the Internet, \"Keep  it  up,\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party\", that can be regarded as election advertising\r\n\r\ntoo.  If someone attends a mass rally\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  subsequently  writes a review on it, it  could  also  be\r\n\r\nregarded as election advertising.  In other words, anyone who\r\n\r\ngives  any view on the Internet, whether to support or to  go\r\n\r\nagainst  any particular party or candidate, can be deemed  to\r\n\r\nbe  election advertising and come under their control.  As to\r\n\r\nhow  to control and whether or not it could be published,  it\r\n\r\nwill be determined by the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, this Bill has also given the\r\n\r\nGovernment the power to deal with the webmaster of  the  site\r\n\r\nwho publishes these expressions or articles.  As a result, no\r\n\r\nwebmaster would be willing to accept for publication  on  his\r\n\r\nsite  any  of these articles.  Consequently, this  Bill  will\r\n\r\ndisable  the effective use of Internet during the  period  of\r\n\r\nthe General Election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it necessary to move this Amendment Bill now?\r\n\r\nThis  is  because,  in  the  past, only  the  newspapers  and\r\n\r\ntelevision  have the capability to transmit messages  to  the\r\n\r\nvoters  and all these media come under strict control of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   During the elections, they all  play  the  same\r\n\r\ntune.  They  will inevitably take the side of the Government,\r\n\r\nand  there  will  be  no coverage that is favourable  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition or unfavourable to the PAP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, with the arrival of the new media era, the\r\n\r\nInternet is becoming more and more popular and has become  an\r\n\r\neffective channel to transmit messages to the voters.  People\r\n\r\nalso have a new space and channel to express their views  and\r\n\r\ncomments.   Inevitably,  there  will  be  no  guarantee  that\r\n\r\nsomeone  who  will publish something over the  Internet  that\r\n\r\nsupports  the  Opposition party and criticises the  PAP,  and\r\n\r\nthis  may  affect the PAP!  That is the reason  why  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment wants to move this legislation to block all  these\r\n\r\nexpressions,  articles and comments that are unfavourable  to\r\n\r\nthe PAP.  This is the true purpose of this Amendment Bill  to\r\n\r\ncontrol the usage of Internet during election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, why is there a need now to ban the\r\n\r\npublication  of  opinion poll and  exit  poll?   The  PAP  is\r\n\r\nworried about the effect of Internet.  In the past, there was\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed  to  legislate  because all the  media  were  under  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  Government.  We all know  that  during  the\r\n\r\nelection  period, whether or not the party or  the  candidate\r\n\r\ncould effectively transmit their messages to their voters  is\r\n\r\nof great importance.  All this while, the opposition parties,\r\n\r\nbesides  holding  election  rally,  the  only  way  of   mass\r\n\r\ncommunication was to print and distribute flyers by inserting\r\n\r\nthem  into the letterboxes of the voters.  It takes a lot  of\r\n\r\nresources   to   print  and  to  distribute   these   flyers,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the GRCs.  A lot of people, time, energy  and\r\n\r\nmoney would be needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the Internet, a relatively effective channel\r\n\r\nto transmit the messages is readily available. We do not have\r\n\r\nto  depend  on  the  newspapers and television  to  send  our\r\n\r\nmessages  across  to our voters.  But the PAP  Government  is\r\n\r\nblocking this channel, and the Minister now can regulate  and\r\n\r\nrestrict  the use of the Internet.  Hence, the Opposition  is\r\n\r\nagain landed in a situation of being disadvantaged.  Is  this\r\n\r\nwhat  the PAP Government claims to be fair competition?  More\r\n\r\napparently, in order to block all these expressions that  are\r\n\r\nfavourable  to  the  Opposition, the Government  has  already\r\n\r\nclassified the SINTERCOM, a non-political party website, as a\r\n\r\npolitical  website - this move brings the website  under  the\r\n\r\nambit  of this amendment.  It is regrettable that the PAP  is\r\n\r\nso very kiasu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amendment Bill once again reveals the true colours\r\n\r\nof  the  PAP  -  to make use of the power and convenience  of\r\n\r\nGovernment to legislate to block all channels that Opposition\r\n\r\nparties could more effectively use to transmit their messages\r\n\r\nand  to communicate with voters so that Opposition party  and\r\n\r\nits  supporters are not able to be effective during election.\r\n\r\nThis   is   the  hypocrisy  of  the  PAP's  claims  to   fair\r\n\r\ncompetition, democracy and openness!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\ninvolves the question of principle and the question of rules.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt whatsoever on the question of principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr Chiam See Tong too commented only on the rules aspect, but\r\n\r\nnot on the principle.  I agree with the principle, but on the\r\n\r\nquestion of rules, I have some reservations.  Mr Chiam  asked\r\n\r\nwhy  a  candidate cannot stand for election in more than  one\r\n\r\nconstituency. This is like one husband wanting to  have  many\r\n\r\nwives.  In  Singapore, the law prohibits polygamy.  Likewise,\r\n\r\nin  an  election law, the candidate must contest only in  one\r\n\r\nconstituency and serve his constituents there.  Mr Chiam must\r\n\r\nhave  been eyeing the Jalan Besar GRC in addition to his  own\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir.  He is not sure whether to move to Jalan Besar,\r\n\r\nor  to  stay  in Potong Pasir. So, to have the best  of  both\r\n\r\nworlds, he wants to contest in both. Well, he may end up with\r\n\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we can support the general principle, and\r\n\r\nthat is, we must have fair competition, to compete on a level\r\n\r\nplaying  ground.   As  we  all know, election  propaganda  or\r\n\r\nadvertising  is  a  very serious matter. Whether  it  is  the\r\n\r\npolitical  parties or the individuals standing for  election,\r\n\r\ntheir  agenda  and views on major national and  international\r\n\r\nissues  must  be clearly communicated to the  voters  to  win\r\n\r\ntheir votes. They should not hide themselves behind the cover\r\n\r\nof the Internet.  They must stand up and say the right things\r\n\r\nat  the  right time. They cannot say things indiscriminately,\r\n\r\nwithout taking responsibility of what they are saying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rules, the Member for Hougang, Mr Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang alleged that our liberalisation on  the  use  of\r\n\r\nInternet  for  the  purpose  of  election  was,  in  fact,  a\r\n\r\nsuppression of the political parties.  If someone is to  post\r\n\r\na  slogan, \"Keep it up, Workers' Party\" on the Internet, I do\r\n\r\nnot  think anybody would take any objection to it. So be  it!\r\n\r\nYou  do  not have to worry about anyone going after you  just\r\n\r\nbecause of that.  If you want to participate in politics, you\r\n\r\nmust  have the political courage, political intelligence  and\r\n\r\nsay  what  you  want to say.  If you are not sure,  then  you\r\n\r\nshould go and do something else instead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rules, Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is  liberalising election advertising on  the\r\n\r\nInternet.   Political parties can advertise  their  platforms\r\n\r\nwith  pictures inserted, and the surfers can hear their voice\r\n\r\nand   see  their  pictures.  As  the  Chinese  saying   goes,\r\n\r\nyou  sheng  you se  (full of sound and colour).   This  shows\r\n\r\nthat  our  legislature and legislation are in pace  with  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  technology.  But we are allowed  to  display\r\n\r\nonly   still   pictures,  but  not  films.  So  no   election\r\n\r\nadvertising motion pictures over the Internet!  Full of sound\r\n\r\nand colour, but no motion!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of technology, our information\r\n\r\nproviders can string together a series of pictures to animate\r\n\r\nthem  and turn these still pictures into some kind of  motion\r\n\r\npictures.   Can the Minister please enlighten us  on  whether\r\n\r\nthis  is  allowed  under this Bill?  I feel  that  we  should\r\n\r\nreview  our law on video-tapes so that our manner of election\r\n\r\ncampaigning can keep pace with the development of technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing\r\n\r\nme to join in the debate on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some sympathy for this Bill and I have more\r\n\r\nquestions than protests or answers.  I have sympathy for  the\r\n\r\nBill  because it clearly is a new kid in town, a new  medium,\r\n\r\nthe  Internet,  which is potentially destabilising.   I  also\r\n\r\nsympathise  in the sense that, at this point, with  elections\r\n\r\nlooming  and talked about, any change or any new rules  would\r\n\r\nbe  scrutinised  very heavily, especially by  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nwhich  has been patently clear from their speeches,  believes\r\n\r\nthat the existing media is very much skewed against them.  In\r\n\r\nlooking through the nature of the changes, I have looked  for\r\n\r\nsome  ideas of trying to be balanced about it, trying to have\r\n\r\nrules  that  help  more  and  more  rational  discussions  of\r\n\r\npolitics  and  a  maturing of Singapore's  young  electorate,\r\n\r\nwhile  avoiding the dangers of, frankly, rules being made  to\r\n\r\nsuit the ruling party.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would disagree with Mr Chew Heng Ching that I\r\n\r\ndo not think this Bill liberalises the rules.  I do not think\r\n\r\nthe  positive set of what a political party can  put  on  the\r\n\r\nwebsite  is actually a step in the right direction.  I  would\r\n\r\nhave  much  preferred a short, specific negative list.   This\r\n\r\nwould  then allow much more creativity between the  different\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  in dressing up their websites,  in  doing\r\n\r\nmany  more things.  In this sense, this positive list,  which\r\n\r\nthe Minister has told us, is perhaps the wrong approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I also cannot agree with Mr Chew that it is\r\n\r\nall clear and transparent.  As the Minister himself has noted\r\n\r\nand  the  Bill  states, there are many more regulations  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  made.  Some of the details that the  Minister  has\r\n\r\ngiven  are clearly not in the Bill and we will have  to  wait\r\n\r\nfor a later date to find out what these regulations are.  The\r\n\r\ndevil will be in the details.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same breath, there have been many questions\r\n\r\nraised  by  MPs before me and I believe Mr Ravindran  himself\r\n\r\nasked  them.   There are the details because  the  making  of\r\n\r\nlegislation creates more intricacies.  Before Nomination Day,\r\n\r\nclearly  things would be allowed and after that, not so.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the timeline and what is allowed  by  whom  are\r\n\r\nincreasingly  complex.  Let me move on to my next  point  and\r\n\r\nthat is to seek some clarifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, but I do not think it is clear whether the\r\n\r\nvery  basic point if I, as an individual, write an e-mail  to\r\n\r\none  or even a thousand friends with my political opinion,  I\r\n\r\nam  not  sure that the Bill could not catch me if I  were  to\r\n\r\nendorse  one  candidate or one party.  This  is  particularly\r\n\r\nbecause  of the definition of political advertising  that  Mr\r\n\r\nLow Thia Khiang has pointed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am not clear as to the ability of non-party\r\n\r\nsites  to  allow  for  debate, to host  letters  or  even  to\r\n\r\npositively  endorse one candidate or one party,  that  is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  the political party's site obviously can do so.   I  am\r\n\r\nnot sure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat  the non-party sites can do.  In the real world of  real\r\n\r\nprint,   I   am  reminded  that  the  Straits  Times,   quite\r\n\r\ntraditionally, does endorse one party, the PAP.  The question\r\n\r\nis whether new sites on the website can do the same thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my next point of even-handedness. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, it does disturb me that the regulations will be made\r\n\r\nby  the Minister because during the campaigning period  there\r\n\r\nis  a question of even-handedness when the Minister is to  be\r\n\r\ncontested  as well.  This is particularly as regards  to  the\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment in section 78B(f) which would  allow  for\r\n\r\nexceptions to be made, not only as to (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)\r\n\r\nwhich  are  all quite specific, but (f), an exception  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  election is banned on \"such other circumstances  or\r\n\r\nactivities as may be prescribed by the Minister by  order  in\r\n\r\nthe  Gazette.\"   It is not at all apparent to me  what  these\r\n\r\nother circumstances or activities may be.  We are looking for\r\n\r\ntransparency and even-handedness.  I think there needs to  be\r\n\r\nsome clearer projection of what this might be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also want to pause here to disagree with two\r\n\r\nother things that Mr  Chiam had said.  First, if I understood\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam  See  Tong  correctly, he is in  favour  of  multi-candidature, that is to say, a candidate could stand in  more\r\n\r\nthan  one  constituency, hope to win perhaps in a GRC  and  a\r\n\r\nsingle  seat, and then give up his GRC seat and leave  it  to\r\n\r\nthe  rest of the team.  From my reading of this, Mr Chiam has\r\n\r\nexposed his election strategy, moving from by-election to two\r\n\r\nelections.  But as a citizen, I do not think this serves  the\r\n\r\nvoters  or  electorate well.  It cannot be in  the  citizens'\r\n\r\ninterest to have somebody run for two seats, win one and give\r\n\r\none  up, and hope that the rest of the team can make  up  for\r\n\r\nthe lost man.  I beg to disagree with Mr Chiam there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that Mr Chiam and Mr Low, in their\r\n\r\nspeeches,  have  made very easy targets of the  local  press.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  is  true that surveys do show  public  opinion,\r\n\r\namong Singaporeans, believes that the media is not fully\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpartial.   However,  I  do  think  there  are   many   good\r\n\r\njournalists and there is a new dynamic in the print media  as\r\n\r\nwell  as television, that the competition the Government  has\r\n\r\nfostered  in  the last year will, I hope, breed  competition,\r\n\r\nfreedom balanced with responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my last point. My appeal to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  to the Minister would be that  elections  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should not be too quiet.  There are  elections  in\r\n\r\nmany  one-party states which come and go and  no  one  knows.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  heat.   There is no  sense  of  people  really\r\n\r\nregistering  their  views.  I think Singapore,  so  far,  has\r\n\r\navoided  this.  But this Bill, like the Bills on the  foreign\r\n\r\nmedia before, takes us in little steps towards increasing the\r\n\r\nregulations that might bring down the temperature.   Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  true  that  we have seen some overheated elections  which\r\n\r\npeople maraud, cause damage, even lose lives, and I would not\r\n\r\nwish  that  to Singapore.  But I think, whether in cyberspace\r\n\r\nor  on the ground, we do need an election period where people\r\n\r\nfeel  that they are allowed to discuss issues freely, fairly,\r\n\r\nwhether  in person, in print or on the Internet.   And  there\r\n\r\nare  many  difficulties in administrating this  new  half-way\r\n\r\nhouse between print and talk.  Internet is bound to have some\r\n\r\nlevel  of  rumour-mongering.   That  is  because  it  is   so\r\n\r\naccessible to all.  But I would ask the Minister to  consider\r\n\r\nwhether  we really need to go so far.  After all, if we  have\r\n\r\ntalked  mainly about the Internet, how about other  forms  of\r\n\r\ncommunication, such as SMS on the handphone?  Would  this  be\r\n\r\nanother  target?  What I am hoping, Sir, is  that  we  should\r\n\r\nmove  towards not just allowing political parties  and  their\r\n\r\nsites  to  have  a free and fair debate but rather  elections\r\n\r\nmust  be  about people, voters and their opinions,  and  that\r\n\r\nthese  regulations,  if anything, must err  on  the  side  of\r\n\r\nfreedom in order to give people their say.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to speak in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main schools of thought on the\r\n\r\nprohibitions  imposed by this Bill.  On the  one  hand,  some\r\n\r\npeople regard unbridled democracy as a sheer form of tyranny,\r\n\r\nas  it  imposes upon the will of others.  Hence, we  need  to\r\n\r\nbalance  the  right  to be democratic with  the  need  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible.   We  need to balance the right  to  information\r\n\r\nwith   the   need   to  discern  the  person  supplying   the\r\n\r\ninformation, whether they have a personal stake in the  well-being  of  Singapore  or they are acting  on  their  personal\r\n\r\nagenda.   We  need to balance the right and  freedom  of  the\r\n\r\nindividuals  to express themselves freely with the  need  for\r\n\r\nthose opinions to be expressed in a responsible manner.  In a\r\n\r\nway,  it is like  parenting.  I like to give my teenager sons\r\n\r\nas much freedom as possible to access information.  But as  a\r\n\r\nresponsible father, I will restrict pornography, violence and\r\n\r\nthe  like.  And if I know that drugs and smoking are bad  for\r\n\r\nthem,  why would I even want to consider letting my  children\r\n\r\ntry them out?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, if I know that misinformation and\r\n\r\nmanipulating of information by persons with their own selfish\r\n\r\nagenda  is against the well-being of Singapore, why  would  I\r\n\r\nwant  Singaporeans to be exposed to such information  without\r\n\r\nsafeguards,  especially on a matter as important as  electing\r\n\r\nleaders of the nation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our age of live broadcast, we do not want\r\n\r\nopinion  polls  to be conducted by third parties  or  foreign\r\n\r\nbroadcasters  who  may  misrepresent  or  manipulate   public\r\n\r\nopinions.   In this regard, I agree that we should not  allow\r\n\r\ndecisions  regarding our future to be influenced  by  persons\r\n\r\nwho may have their own private agendas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans may have the right to information but it is\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of the Government to ensure that our citizens  are\r\n\r\nentitled to information from responsible persons.  In this IT\r\n\r\nage, we are flooded with all kinds of information.  On issues\r\n\r\naffecting  the  future  of  the  nation,  we  want  to   have\r\n\r\ninformation generated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  persons  with a strong regard for the well-being  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens rather than opinions generated by third parties with\r\n\r\nno personal stake in the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the greatest irony of our age is that having more\r\n\r\nknowledge does not necessarily make one any wiser.  Giving  a\r\n\r\nman  too  many  options does not lead him to  make  a  better\r\n\r\nchoice.   At the end of the day, voting is something personal\r\n\r\nand  sacrosanct to the voter.  The choice of the voter should\r\n\r\nbe based on his knowledge of the political party or candidate\r\n\r\nrather  than  knowledge of how other voters  choose.   Voting\r\n\r\nshould be based on the political platform and confidence that\r\n\r\nthe  voter has for the party or candidate, not on the opinion\r\n\r\nof  other voters.  We do not want a situation where materials\r\n\r\nare  circulated during the election period without any  names\r\n\r\non  it.   We  do  not want a situation where  candidates  and\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  go  beyond  their  means  and  limits  in\r\n\r\nelection  advertising.  We do not want to have our  political\r\n\r\nparties and candidates to be dependent on the purse of  third\r\n\r\nparties  who may have their own private agendas in supporting\r\n\r\ntheir election advertising.  This can lead to money politics.\r\n\r\nWhere possible, we must remove any danger and possibility  of\r\n\r\nmoney politics taking place in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the Bill can help to minimise the\r\n\r\nmanipulation  of  public  opinions prior  to  and  during  an\r\n\r\nelection.   The  requirements in the Bill can  also  help  to\r\n\r\nensure  greater accountability on the part of  the  political\r\n\r\nparties,  candidates  and third parties engaged  in  election\r\n\r\nadvertising.  The Government should also be commended for its\r\n\r\nalertness to the potential dangers that advancements in info-communications  technology can present.  In  this  regard,  I\r\n\r\nalso  applaud  the Government for its courage to  make  tough\r\n\r\ndecisions to deal with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another school of thought on this Bill. Some\r\n\r\npurists of democracy will readily cite these prohibitions  to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate their perception of Singapore as veering towards\r\n\r\na  police state, that the Bill impinges on the freedom of the\r\n\r\nindividuals and political parties to contest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfreely  in  an  election.  These people  would  consider  the\r\n\r\nprohibition of the publication of election opinion  polls  as\r\n\r\nan   affront  to  the  individual's  freedom  of  speech  and\r\n\r\nexpression.   They  would consider the  prohibitions  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet as unnecessarily authoritarian and even dictatorial.\r\n\r\nThis  group  of people will ask why do the United  States  of\r\n\r\nAmerica,  widely  regarded as the  epitome  of  a  democratic\r\n\r\nnation,  allows election opinion polls to be freely conducted\r\n\r\nand yet the Singapore Government wants to ban it.  Surely our\r\n\r\ncitizens  would be sophisticated enough to make  the  correct\r\n\r\nchoice  of  electing their political leaders,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhat the opinion polls may suggest.  Surely those who are  IT\r\n\r\nsavvy  enough to surf the Internet would be able  to  discern\r\n\r\nand  brandish  the gimmicks and electioneering ploys  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet.  If we place limits to the freedom of expression on\r\n\r\nthe  Internet,  we appear to go against the  grain  of  Prof.\r\n\r\nMichael  Porter's recent advice for us to loosen up.   If  we\r\n\r\ndefine \"election advertising\" and \"publish\" so broadly in the\r\n\r\nBill,  we may unwittingly send a wrong message to our already\r\n\r\npolitically apathetic younger generation of Singaporeans that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  communicate anything with a political  flavour,\r\n\r\nespecially during the election period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern in this regard is whether we have\r\n\r\ndefined  the  terms \"election advertising\" and \"publish\"  too\r\n\r\nbroadly  that  they  become catch-all tools  that  cover  too\r\n\r\nextensively  non-political party activists who  may  want  to\r\n\r\nexpress  their  views on the election.  For example,  someone\r\n\r\nattends an election rally and becomes a converted follower of\r\n\r\nthat  political  party, be it the ruling  or  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties.   He  sends  an e-mail to ask all  his  friends  and\r\n\r\nrelatives  to vote for that particular political  party.   On\r\n\r\nthe  basis of his personal conviction, he proceeds to ask all\r\n\r\nhis  friends and relatives to canvass their friends  to  vote\r\n\r\nlikewise.  He even includes in his e-mail that out of the  50\r\n\r\nfriends that he has asked and polled, 40 of them have decided\r\n\r\nto vote for that political party.  Does the Bill prohibit him\r\n\r\nto  carry out the above actions, even though he may be acting\r\n\r\non his personal conviction?  If it does, I would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuggest that we review the definition of these terms, as they\r\n\r\nare deemed to be too broad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these concerns, which I hope that the Minister\r\n\r\ncan clarify, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, I believe you wanted to seek\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for giving me this\r\n\r\nopportunity to ask the hon.

But  as a Member of Parliament, he can only serve  one\r\n\r\nconstituency  and be faithful to his voters.

I\r\n\r\nhope  that  he will be more faithful to his own constituency.\r\n\r\nSince    Mr    Chiam   remarked   about   my    analogy    of\r\n\r\nyi  fu duo qi (one husband many wives), I would change it  to\r\n\r\nyi fu duo qu (one person many constituencies).\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I just wish to  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Minister to the penalties for  offences  of\r\n\r\npublishing    information   conducted   through    the    new\r\n\r\ntechnological media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the advent of the world wide web, electronic\r\n\r\nmail  and short message service on mobile phones, information\r\n\r\ncan be disseminated at literally lightning speed.  Unlike the\r\n\r\ntraditional   media,   new  technologies   allow   for   mass\r\n\r\ncirculation  of information at the click of a mouse.   Unlike\r\n\r\nthe traditional media, a website may also be published by any\r\n\r\nother   party's  sympathiser  or  person  in  an   unfriendly\r\n\r\njurisdiction and is made available to all Singaporeans.   The\r\n\r\nease, convenience and cost of sending an e-mail to one person\r\n\r\nis  no different from sending to one million persons.  Worse,\r\n\r\nthe e-mail may be just as easily propagated.  The malicious e-mail  may also be re-routed through another country  or  sent\r\n\r\nanonymously which, I understand, can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will this be controlled, Sir? The short is that\r\n\r\ninformation, whether true, false or malicious,  may  be  most\r\n\r\neasily  disseminated than at any time in human history.   The\r\n\r\ndamage of false information done through the modern media can\r\n\r\nbe  most  devastating.  The propagation of poison pen letters\r\n\r\nis  as old as there are elections.  In the traditional media,\r\n\r\nit is very difficult to mass mail a poison pen letter and get\r\n\r\naway  with it.  But in the new technological media, much harm\r\n\r\ncan  be  done.  In the recent election at one of the branches\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Airlines Staff Union, just  for  a  branch\r\n\r\nelection,  there were a lot of poison pen letters being  sent\r\n\r\nout  blackening the various candidates who were standing  for\r\n\r\nelection.  Poison\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npen letter is also one of the common features found in use in\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one cannot appreciate the enormity of the problem\r\n\r\nof  a  poison pen letter unless he is a victim.  Imagine  the\r\n\r\npower  of a poison pen e-mail done in the midst of a  general\r\n\r\nelection.  By the time the truth is established, if it can be\r\n\r\nestablished  at all, the harm is already done.  In  politics,\r\n\r\nalthough the allegations may be malicious and false, the  mud\r\n\r\nsticks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I am of the view that the penalties should be\r\n\r\nenhanced manifold when falsehoods are propagated by  the  new\r\n\r\ntechnological media.  Penalties under the Bill  for  offences\r\n\r\ncommitted  through  the  new technological  media  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered separately from the traditional media.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  penalties for offences committed through the  use  of\r\n\r\nmodern  technology  should  be higher  than  the  traditional\r\n\r\nmedia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank you\r\n\r\nfor  giving me the opportunity to join in the debate on  this\r\n\r\nBill on which I rise to support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of this Bill has generated much\r\n\r\ninterest  and debate in the public forum, not least of  which\r\n\r\nis  the  issue of political campaigning on the Internet.   As\r\n\r\nyou  are  aware,  Sir, the Bill, in principle,  broadens  the\r\n\r\nscope of election advertising to include publications on  the\r\n\r\nInternet.  What the Bill tries to do is to regulate such form\r\n\r\nof  publication  by  requiring to make known  the  names  and\r\n\r\naddresses  of  the publisher and the person for  whom  or  at\r\n\r\nwhose  direction the election advertising is  published.   It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  in any way seek to prevent anyone from  publishing\r\n\r\nhis  political  views or inclinations so long  as  it  is  in\r\n\r\ncompliance with the prescriptions of the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore surprises me, Sir, that the Opposition\r\n\r\nparty  should  be so quick to jump at this new Bill  to  make\r\n\r\nwild  allegations  that the Bill is yet, to  quote,  \"another\r\n\r\nsorry  attempt  by  the PAP to prevent  the  Opposition  from\r\n\r\neffectively  reaching  out to voters during  elections\".   In\r\n\r\nmaking  this comment, Sir, the Opposition has failed  to  see\r\n\r\nthe real issue.  We are not afraid of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncriticisms or comments, no matter what these comments may be.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing in law at the moment to prevent  one  from\r\n\r\nharshly  criticising,  in  the open,  Government's  policies.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  do  require, however, is that the  people  who  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to  criticise must be prepared to come  forward,  to\r\n\r\ncome  out in the open, to stand by their statements.  Nothing\r\n\r\ncan be more cowardly than for one to take potshots at another\r\n\r\nand  choose  to remain anonymous for fear of shouldering  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities that come with the public statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that democracy protects and upholds the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of expression.  However, democracy is also  as  much\r\n\r\nabout  responsibility  as it is about right.   Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nsomebody were to defame another person's name or someone  who\r\n\r\nwere   to   make   seditious   statements,   he   must   take\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for his action.  Why should  anyone  be  less\r\n\r\ndeserving of protection of the law simply because  he  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  public limelight?  What the Opposition is asking for  is\r\n\r\nto  give people the liberty to say whatever they want without\r\n\r\ntaking  responsibility  for it.  Sir,  I  do  not  find  this\r\n\r\nacceptable  neither  do  I  think the  rest  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nnecessarily find this acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet is a new frontier that we are still trying\r\n\r\nto  grapple with.  The latest edition of The Economist  dated\r\n\r\n11th-17th August 2001 recognises that the imposition of local\r\n\r\nrules  may  be  better  than  the alternative  of  having  no\r\n\r\nregulation at all.  It further states that a complete lack of\r\n\r\nregulation  gives  a free hand to cheats and  criminals.   It\r\n\r\ngenerally  recognises  that  the  Internet,  like   all   new\r\n\r\nfrontiers,  will  be  wild  for a while  and  eventually  the\r\n\r\npolicemen  and  the law will come round to  enforce  law  and\r\n\r\norder.   The  regulation of publications on the  Internet  is\r\n\r\nconsistent  with  the policies that we have  taken  over  the\r\n\r\nyears  with  respect  to printed documents.   These  policies\r\n\r\napply equally to all, including the PAP.  If the PAP has done\r\n\r\nsuch  a lousy job in running this country, then no amount  of\r\n\r\nregulation, whether on the Internet or otherwise, is going to\r\n\r\nprevent people from spreading their views to members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at this Bill before us, Sir, let us take a\r\n\r\nproper  perspective on the issue.  This Bill is not  so  much\r\n\r\nabout  regulating the content as it is about prescribing  the\r\n\r\nmanner  and form in which the content is disseminated to  the\r\n\r\npublic  at  large.   Democracy is not only  about  individual\r\n\r\nrights  but  also about respect for the others.   To  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  law  should  be removed to allow  people  complete\r\n\r\nliberty  to say whatever they want without having to identify\r\n\r\nthemselves  with it, is to bring about anarchy  and  not  the\r\n\r\nrule of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore support this Bill and in particular the\r\n\r\nattempts  of  the Government to regulate election advertising\r\n\r\non the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, many who disagree with this Bill see there  is\r\n\r\nan  attempt to curb perhaps the only available and accessible\r\n\r\navenue  for  anyone,  big or small, who can  have  their  say\r\n\r\nwithout  fear  or  retribution.  More  often  than  not,  the\r\n\r\nInternet  provides  the  only level playing  field  as  other\r\n\r\nchannels  sometimes  tend to be more  accessible  and  biased\r\n\r\ntowards the bigger man.  This is a special feature, a  sacred\r\n\r\nquality  of the Internet.  The basic question, therefore,  is\r\n\r\nwhether  the Internet should be regulated like in other  news\r\n\r\nmedium.    Indeed,  it  is  ironical  that  in  new   section\r\n\r\n78A(1)(b), the Bill makes an exception for election news  for\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  on TV and radio, but no exception  is  made  for\r\n\r\nelection  news on standalone Internet site.  Is the  Internet\r\n\r\nthen not a legitimate news medium?  I hope the Minister would\r\n\r\nclarify this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill does not prohibit Internet advertising, as\r\n\r\nmany  have  misunderstood, but it makes it  mandatory  for  a\r\n\r\nperson  to  register  with  the SBA  to  identify  the  name,\r\n\r\npublisher and printer of the advertisement.  In my view, Sir,\r\n\r\nif  the  purpose  of  the  advertisement  is  to  promote   a\r\n\r\ncandidate, to inform its electorate about the good work he is\r\n\r\ndoing, and it should be, I do not see why there should  be  a\r\n\r\nstrong  objection to identify the name of the  publisher  and\r\n\r\nprinter as they would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nultimately be the beneficiary of this advertisement.  But  if\r\n\r\nthe purpose is to speak negatively about someone else, spread\r\n\r\nwild  rumours and allegations, then I can see the  objections\r\n\r\nin  revealing such identities.  If you look at past elections\r\n\r\nin  and  around  the region, advertisements and  publications\r\n\r\nissued are seldom about the good work of one person but  more\r\n\r\nabout  the  bad  things others have done.   So  the  question\r\n\r\nreally  is  whether  we  should  allow  advertisements   made\r\n\r\nanonymously.   The Internet gives us the freedom  to  inform.\r\n\r\nBut  one can also agree that we need to inform truthfully and\r\n\r\nresponsibly.   If  we  have  to  legislate  to  prevent   the\r\n\r\nirresponsible  use  of  the Internet,  then  in  the  overall\r\n\r\ninterest, Sir, it is worth it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like Prof. Chin who spoke earlier, I would have\r\n\r\nexpected the Bill to be more specific in detailing the  forms\r\n\r\nof advertising allowed under new section 78A(1)(b) because  I\r\n\r\nsuspect   the   interpretation  of   the   details   can   be\r\n\r\ncontroversial and problematic.  I would also like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he would think it more appropriate  to  have\r\n\r\nthis  responsibility delegated to the SBA,  as  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  may perhaps be seen as partisan when having to  make\r\n\r\nsuch  a  regulation,  especially  during  or  before  general\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have seen examples in the region how political\r\n\r\ncandidates have to do battle on the Internet sites where  the\r\n\r\nmore juicy and damaging news were anonymously circulated when\r\n\r\nthe   real   battle  should  be  on  the   ground,   in   the\r\n\r\nconstituencies  and with the electorate.   There  is  a  real\r\n\r\ndanger  that  others without vested interest in the  election\r\n\r\ncan dictate the political campaign during election.  However,\r\n\r\ndespite  these provisions, we cannot regulate Internet  sites\r\n\r\nposted  outside Singapore.  So although we have laws to  take\r\n\r\non  errant publishers through libel and defamation law suits,\r\n\r\nthe question is: is monetary compensation a sufficient remedy\r\n\r\nfor  someone  who  had lost the election because  of  rumour-mongering or false allegation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, Sir, I would agree to the general\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  this Bill.  However, there are some  specific\r\n\r\nissues which I am\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquite  uncomfortable with.  In particular, the Bill tries  to\r\n\r\nforce  a distinction between public communication and private\r\n\r\ncommunication  that  simply does not apply  in  the  Internet\r\n\r\nworld.   The  Bill excludes individual to individual  e-mail.\r\n\r\nBut it says in clause 2(c) that Internet communication to any\r\n\r\nsection  of the public will be treated as publication.   Like\r\n\r\nmany  others who have commented earlier, does this mean  that\r\n\r\nif  I  have  a  mailing  list with  100  friends,  I  can  be\r\n\r\nprosecuted under the law if I e-mail my views on the election\r\n\r\nto  my mailing list?  Will I be penalised for having too many\r\n\r\nfriends?  So, Sir, how do we deal with such practical issues?\r\n\r\nHow  do  we  draw a line between those who set out  to  cause\r\n\r\ndamage  and  mischief  and  others  who  do  not  have   such\r\n\r\nintentions,  although  I  would  agree  that  the  e-mail  or\r\n\r\nInternet makes it possible the consequences of such action to\r\n\r\nbe equally damaging?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason, Sir, that I suggest perhaps the\r\n\r\nMinister describe an appeal procedure to be heard by the  SBA\r\n\r\nbefore referring such matters for prosecution under the  law.\r\n\r\nSBA,  with  its representatives from a good cross section  of\r\n\r\nthe  population, can play a delicate balancing role  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter.   Only in this way, Sir, we can preserve the  special\r\n\r\nfeature  of the Internet, while at the same time safeguarding\r\n\r\nagainst real abuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all\r\n\r\nthe 12 Members who have spoken on the Bill.  The impression I\r\n\r\ngot  after listening carefully to the debate is that everyone\r\n\r\nsupports  the  Bill in principle.  In fact, I  heard  only  a\r\n\r\ndissenting  voice  from  Mr Chiam  with  regard  to  multiple\r\n\r\nnominations during elections and some comments on the opinion\r\n\r\npoll  during elections.  Apart from these comments,  I  think\r\n\r\neverybody  supports  the  Bill in principle.   The  questions\r\n\r\nrelate mainly to details about the regulations, what kind  of\r\n\r\npositive  list, how the law will apply in certain situations,\r\n\r\nhow   we   differentiate  between  broadcast  and  individual\r\n\r\ncommunication, and so on.  In fact, in drafting the Bill, the\r\n\r\nAG's  Chambers  has been very careful to try to  be  fair  to\r\n\r\neverybody.  It is a very complex subject and we will have  to\r\n\r\nlearn as we go\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalong.   Unfortunately, at this point in time,  the  detailed\r\n\r\nregulations are not ready yet.  They will be ready before the\r\n\r\nelections.   But  we do have to get this Bill  in  place  and\r\n\r\ndebate on the principles of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in my Second Reading speech, in fact\r\n\r\nthis is a positive step, in terms of liberalising the use  of\r\n\r\nInternet for political campaigning.  As compared to 1997, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Broadcasting Authority had to ask some parties  to\r\n\r\nremove posters on their websites.  This is definitely  a  big\r\n\r\nstep  forward.  The rules will apply equally to all  parties.\r\n\r\nEverybody can use the Internet to reach out to their  voters,\r\n\r\nand  to explain their positions.  The key point is that  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  do it responsibly.  They should be responsible  for\r\n\r\ntheir sites.  They should not libel anybody.  They should not\r\n\r\nspread  falsehoods,  and they should not  hide  behind  other\r\n\r\nsites, for example, non-party political sites, some of  which\r\n\r\nare   clearly  slanted  in  their  viewpoints  and  are  just\r\n\r\nmasquerading as neutral sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media, especially the foreign media, have been very\r\n\r\nfast  to cry foul when DPM Lee Hsien Loong mentioned  at  the\r\n\r\nlaunch   of  the  PAP  website  that  we  have  to  institute\r\n\r\nregulations  to  allow  campaigning on  the  Internet.   They\r\n\r\nassumed straightaway that we are going to clamp down, and all\r\n\r\nkinds  of reports came out in the papers to criticise us  and\r\n\r\nsaid  that we were tightening controls.  In fact,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  I  am correct but I think even the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers  here  were caught by surprise that we are  going  to\r\n\r\nallow  it.  It is just a matter of how to do it.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthey  have to oppose the Bill somehow.  In the end, they  did\r\n\r\nexpress  some negative sentiments.  But it is a fact that  we\r\n\r\nare moving forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet is a very difficult place. It is full of\r\n\r\nnoise.   If  misinformation is spread, it can  go  round  the\r\n\r\nworld  several  times within a day.  So it is very  important\r\n\r\nthat for something so important as our General Elections  the\r\n\r\npublic  is  not  misled  and  the  parties  should  be  fully\r\n\r\nresponsible for their viewpoints.  They should come out  with\r\n\r\nreasoned  arguments and state their positions.  There  are  a\r\n\r\nlot of issues on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  they have strong views.  It is up to them to  convince\r\n\r\nthe  public  openly through their web pages -  these  are  my\r\n\r\nviews,  this is why Government is wrong, etc, - and  the  PAP\r\n\r\nwill respond in kind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting this regulation, the main concern is really\r\n\r\nwith  the  broadcast  media through the Internet,  the  party\r\n\r\nsites which are clearly identified with the parties and  also\r\n\r\nthose  sites  which  are political in  nature,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ncontent,  which are required by the SBA Class Licence  Scheme\r\n\r\nto  be registered with us.  The intention is to make clear to\r\n\r\neverybody  that these are the people behind the  Net,  behind\r\n\r\nthis  web page, and that they are in fact political in nature\r\n\r\neven  though they claim to be neutral.  Other than that, they\r\n\r\nhave  been coming up with all kinds of views criticising  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  we take it in the right spirit.   There  is\r\n\r\nfreedom of speech, there is freedom of information.  You  can\r\n\r\naccess  information from anywhere around the world.  You  can\r\n\r\nput  your views on the Internet.  If you want to e-mail  your\r\n\r\nfriends, by all means.  But how do we know that it is  not  a\r\n\r\nparty  member  who is sending thousands of  e-mails  out  and\r\n\r\nbypassing our rules.  How do we contain the problem, in  what\r\n\r\nis  basically a very noisy, very difficult environment  where\r\n\r\ninformation and misinformation can spread equally quickly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I will just read out to you some comments\r\n\r\nfrom  an American who is living here, a gentleman called John\r\n\r\nB.  Carpenter.  This was published in the Washington Post  on\r\n\r\n18th  July  and is titled \"Singapore internet story  full  of\r\n\r\nWestern  hypocrisy\".  This was in response to an  article  in\r\n\r\nthe  Washington  Times by Mr Regan Morris of  the  Associated\r\n\r\nPress dated 16th July which was very quick off the mark after\r\n\r\nDPM Lee's speech on the launch of the PAP website.  It reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As an American living in Singapore, I found the July 16\r\n\r\narticle about Singapore highly stereotyped and an example  of\r\n\r\nwhy  many  in Asia are cynical about appeals for \"freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report, from the Associated Press, states that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  government  has  a  \"firm  grip  on  the  flow  of\r\n\r\ninformation\".  I'm in Singapore, and I used\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Internet to read this one-sided story.  I also can access\r\n\r\nany Web site in the world critical of Singapore's government.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  the BBC World Service Radio  airs  here.   The\r\n\r\nSingaporean  government  certainly cannot  control  what  BBC\r\n\r\nbroadcasts from London.  The major American newsmagazines are\r\n\r\nsold  here  as well.  They are required to be fair and  allow\r\n\r\nthe  government a \"right of reply\" when it perceives they are\r\n\r\nunfair.   This seems, however, to be asking for no more  than\r\n\r\njournalistic integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, it was integrity that this report lacked. No\r\n\r\nregulation  has  yet  been introduced in Singapore,  but  the\r\n\r\nreporter  sounds  as  if  he is sure it  will  be  draconian.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the US government has been busy trying to regulate\r\n\r\nAmericans'  freedom of speech during elections.  Is  it  just\r\n\r\nthat we're (mostly) white and Western that we believe we  can\r\n\r\nbe trusted with such regulations, while Asians cannot?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an article by John B. Carpenter in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the discussion today has been on the Internet\r\n\r\ncampaigning.   So  I will deal with this item  first.   As  I\r\n\r\nexplained,  the  intention is to have a level playing  field.\r\n\r\nWe  do  need to have some kind of regulations.  The intention\r\n\r\nis  to  come out with the positive list, through regulations,\r\n\r\nwhich will be available before the elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some questions have been asked about the new laws. For\r\n\r\nexample,  this  question was raised  about  the  new  section\r\n\r\n78B(e)  relating  to  publication of  any  news  relating  to\r\n\r\nelection in newspapers or in a radio or television broadcast.\r\n\r\nI  think  Mr Zulkifli mentioned this.  I would like to  point\r\n\r\nout  that  the new section 78B deals with Polling  Day.   The\r\n\r\nintention  is  that, on that day itself, there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nfreeze on new advertising messages.  This is in line with the\r\n\r\ncurrent  practice to allow the voters to reflect  in  a  calm\r\n\r\nmanner without disturbances on how they want to vote.  On the\r\n\r\nother hand, we must allow the newspapers to report.  So  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  reporting on the elections.  And Mr  Chiam  claimed\r\n\r\nthat the headlines are detrimental to the Opposition parties.\r\n\r\nI  differ  with that view.  In fact, if I recall  during  our\r\n\r\nlast  elections in Cheng San, the report was full  about  Tan\r\n\r\nLiang  Hong and his suits and counter suits, and so  on.   So\r\n\r\nhow  did they affect the election one way or the other?   But\r\n\r\nthe  point is we do want to have silence and calm on  Polling\r\n\r\nDay, and that is why we disallow new advertising messages  on\r\n\r\nthat day.  Whatever is on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwebsite  already, it remains.  But there should  not  be  any\r\n\r\nchanges.  The newspapers and TV should be free to report  the\r\n\r\nnews.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of mass e-mail is troubling quite a few\r\n\r\npeople.   I  will  have  to  get my officers  to  study  this\r\n\r\ncarefully.    The  intention  here  is  to   go   after   the\r\n\r\nbroadcasters, the websites reaching out to a lot  of  people.\r\n\r\nThe  intention is not to go after individuals  in  their  own\r\n\r\nprivate  e-mailing.   But the point is:  will  somebody  hide\r\n\r\nbehind  this system and have a chain mail system  and  bypass\r\n\r\nour  rules?  So this is something that we have to study  more\r\n\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was raised whether SMS, ie, the handphones\r\n\r\nthat youngsters are very fond of using, will be covered.   At\r\n\r\nthe bottom of page 2, the Bill says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"'Publish' means make available to the general public,\r\n\r\nor  any  section  thereof, in whatever form and  by  whatever\r\n\r\nmeans,  including  broadcasting (by  wireless  telegraphy  or\r\n\r\notherwise) and transmitting on what is commonly known as  the\r\n\r\nInternet.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nSo  the  word \"wireless\" could mean handphones.  I think  SMS\r\n\r\nwill be covered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point is if you are trying to send out, for\r\n\r\nexample,  your election poll results, firstly,  you  are  not\r\n\r\nsupposed to do it, but if you do it and you try and  send  it\r\n\r\nout  by  SMS to everybody, that will be violating the  rules.\r\n\r\nBut  the intention is not to disallow a young man to SMS  his\r\n\r\ngirl  friend and say, \"Oh, I think this chap is speaking well\r\n\r\nor he looks very attractive\" or maybe a female sending to her\r\n\r\nboy friend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong mentioned the point about pictures\r\n\r\nbeing  stills  but that they can be made to be  moving.   The\r\n\r\nAct,  which  disallows political films,  is  valid  and  will\r\n\r\napply.   It  does  not  disallow  audio  broadcasting.    For\r\n\r\nexample, if audio messages are sent on the Internet, they are\r\n\r\nnot  captured  under the Films Act.  On the  other  hand,  if\r\n\r\ntechnology  allows us to piece together pictures as  if  they\r\n\r\nare  moving  pictures,  then we will have  to  study  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  in fact it is a political film.  The reason is  that\r\n\r\nfilms are very emotive.  You can have a few sound bytes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  influence elections by saying a few catchy  phrases  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  nobody to come and counter you.  That is  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  decided  some years back  to  disallow  political\r\n\r\nfilms  and political videos so that section of the  Act  will\r\n\r\napply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was asked about foreign sites. The rules are\r\n\r\nintended  to  apply  to  all sites under  the  Class  Licence\r\n\r\nScheme.  They are supposed to be responsible, should  not  do\r\n\r\nanything  that  instigates racial hatred, be  against  public\r\n\r\ninterest, public morality and so on.  All sites are bound  by\r\n\r\nthe  Class  Licence Scheme and, specifically,  for  political\r\n\r\nsites and sites which are obviously political in nature, they\r\n\r\nhave to register with the SBA.  That is why we corrected this\r\n\r\nsituation  where  some  of the sites like  Think  Centre  and\r\n\r\nSINTERCOM were not registered.  All we wanted is to get  them\r\n\r\nto  register  and  tell  us who are  behind  the  sites,  the\r\n\r\npublishers and the people responsible.  This way, we hope  to\r\n\r\nput them on notice that they have to be responsible for their\r\n\r\nsites.  The laws of the land will apply to cyberspace and, if\r\n\r\nthey libel somebody, they can be sued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be other questions on Internet campaigning\r\n\r\nbut I cannot trace them here.  If hon. Members would like  to\r\n\r\nraise them, I will try and answer them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to answer the points raised by Mr Chiam\r\n\r\nabout  multiple  candidature.   It  shows  that  he  has   an\r\n\r\nintention,  before  this Bill is passed, maybe  to  stand  in\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir, and also in Jalan Besar GRC under the SDA.   A\r\n\r\nkind  of  tikam-tikam, ie, \"If I lose in a GRC,  at  least  I\r\n\r\nstill  have Potong Pasir.\"  I think he should be fair to  the\r\n\r\nvoters.   If he wants to stand for an area and work for  that\r\n\r\narea,  he should just stand for that area.  Why make  use  of\r\n\r\nthis Victorian rule which is out of date?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make the point that what we have done is,\r\n\r\nreally, very limited in scope.  We are not curtailing freedom\r\n\r\nof  speech.  People can email, write letters to the press and\r\n\r\nspeak  freely.  But, for the purpose of the election,  during\r\n\r\nthe election period, and for political websites and non-party\r\n\r\npolitical websites, we must have some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrules  to make sure that campaigning is orderly and  fair  to\r\n\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered\r\n\r\none  of  my queries in my speech and that is whether articles\r\n\r\nin  local  newspapers are covered by clause 2, the definition\r\n\r\nof election advertising.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I thank Mr Chiam for reminding me\r\n\r\nabout  his question.  On listening to his speech, I was under\r\n\r\nthe impression that he was asking whether this ban on opinion\r\n\r\npolls  applies  to  the mass media.  The answer  is  yes,  it\r\n\r\napplies  to  all  media,  not  just  the  Internet  but  also\r\n\r\nnewspapers, TV and so on.  Thank you for pointing  this  out.\r\n\r\nThe answer is that the mass media is also covered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to clarify that whilst\r\n\r\nI  do not state clearly whether I oppose the Bill, I wish  to\r\n\r\nclarify  that  although  I  have  no  problem  with  multiple\r\n\r\nnominations,  which I support, and also on opinion  polls,  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  problem with that, I do not think the Bill  on  the\r\n\r\nwhole has enhanced or helped our position in any way by using\r\n\r\nthe Internet.  I am opposing that part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have some clarifications for the Minister. I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to know, first of all, for third party  websites\r\n\r\nwhich are not under the Class Licence Scheme of SBA, if  they\r\n\r\npublish  during  the election period, eg,  a  report  on  the\r\n\r\nelection campaign or their opinion on a political rally, will\r\n\r\nthat come under the Bill?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can he tell us what specifically will be the\r\n\r\nregulation?  For instance, he mentioned just now that we  can\r\n\r\nhave  our  candidates' profile and things like that.   May  I\r\n\r\nknow  whether a political party website would be  allowed  to\r\n\r\npublish  speeches  of  the rallies  and  report  on  election\r\n\r\ncampaigns, for instance?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to know whether the current\r\n\r\nregulations under the SBA are not sufficient enough  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  whatever  problems that may arise during  an  election.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  there  a  need  to have a different  set  of  strict\r\n\r\nregulations,  with  very  strict  and  wide  definitions   on\r\n\r\nelection\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadvertising,   to   restrict  the  use  of  Internet   during\r\n\r\nelections?  Is that not a restriction on the use of  Internet\r\n\r\nby  political parties?  I do not understand how that actually\r\n\r\nenhances the usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I mentioned in my\r\n\r\nspeech  that  for  party  political websites,  the  allowable\r\n\r\nfeatures  will include party posters and manifesto, candidate\r\n\r\nprofiles,  announcement of party events,  party  position  on\r\n\r\nissues, moderated chats and discussion forums.  This  is  not\r\n\r\nexclusive.   There  will be other elements  which  are  still\r\n\r\nbeing   drafted.   The  whole  point  is  that  this   covers\r\n\r\npractically everything that they want to do.  So  as  regards\r\n\r\nMr  Low's  point about putting speeches on the Internet,  why\r\n\r\nnot?   And even his own comments on rallies, again, why  not?\r\n\r\nThese  are all covered.  These are positions on issues.   The\r\n\r\npoint  is  that  the  party must be  identified,  eg,  it  is\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party site and all these are Workers' Party's views.\r\n\r\nPeople  can  go  and attend his rallies, they  can  read  his\r\n\r\nspeeches  on  the  Internet.  So this is  definitely  a  step\r\n\r\nforward.   This  is  allowing campaigning  on  the  Internet,\r\n\r\nwithin  certain regulations.  What we want to do is  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  the parties and the people responsible know  that\r\n\r\nthey  have to comply with the law, be careful that what  they\r\n\r\nput up does not libel anybody or spread falsehoods.  So I  do\r\n\r\nnot understand when Mr Low says it does not help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I get the impression that the hon. Member is\r\n\r\nopposing this just for the sake of opposing.  We are allowing\r\n\r\nand  he  is  opposing.  Shall we just not allow?   The  other\r\n\r\npoint is ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, shall we allow and without\r\n\r\nstrict regulation on that?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Low, can you allow the Minister\r\n\r\nto finish?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I think the Member will be aware that\r\n\r\nInternet is a very dangerous place.  We can have all kinds of\r\n\r\npoison letters and they will just spread like wild fire.   So\r\n\r\nwe  must  have some means to try and minimise this  and  make\r\n\r\nsure that everything is orderly and fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point about third-party sites, I mentioned\r\n\r\njust now that third-party sites also have to comply with  the\r\n\r\nInternet code of practice.  We require specifically political\r\n\r\nsites  and sites which are obviously political in nature  and\r\n\r\nactive  political  sites  to  be  registered  with  the  SBA.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, all the sites and web pages are covered under  the\r\n\r\nClass  Licence  Scheme.  And if they violate the  rules  with\r\n\r\nregard  to, for example, information that could cause  racial\r\n\r\nriots  or is pornography, they could be fined or SBA can  ask\r\n\r\nthem to take down the websites.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. I wish to\r\n\r\nclarify  that whilst I do not have problem with the amendment\r\n\r\non  Multiple Nomination and do not have much problem with the\r\n\r\nban  on  opinion  poll,  I do not support  the  amendment  to\r\n\r\nregulate  the use of Internet during election.  Sir,  what  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  know is if a website which is not under  the  Class\r\n\r\nLicence Scheme posts something on the web during the election\r\n\r\nperiod  and supports a political party, for instance,  is  it\r\n\r\nliable under the amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Then we will have to see the actual\r\n\r\nsituation.  But, as I said, the intention is to go after  the\r\n\r\npopular  sites,  the  main  sites of  parties  and  non-party\r\n\r\npolitical  sites.  If it is an individual, eg,  a  young  man\r\n\r\nposting  up his own site and saying \"These are my views\",  we\r\n\r\nare  not  going to go after those people.  We are only  after\r\n\r\nthe  main broadcast medium, and an email is in the nature  of\r\n\r\nprivate mail.  It just happens to be on the Internet.  So our\r\n\r\nintention is not to go after those but, at the same time,  it\r\n\r\nis  perfectly feasible for a member to arrange  to  send  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  messages  through  mass  mailing  and  defeat  the\r\n\r\nregulations.  That is why we will have to study carefully how\r\n\r\nwe can regulate the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister is\r\n\r\nclear.  What I want to know is, for instance, Talkingcock.com\r\n\r\nis  not  under the Class Licence Scheme.  During the election\r\n\r\nperiod, eg, the website publishes some political speeches  of\r\n\r\nopposition  candidates  or  have  certain  comments  on   the\r\n\r\nelection.  Will the web\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmaster  or  whoever posts it there be liable under the  Bill?\r\n\r\nThat is what I want to know.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Well, we will have to study the law.\r\n\r\nBut  my impression is that they are liable.  Of course,  they\r\n\r\nare  outside  Singapore, and whether we  can  catch  them  is\r\n\r\nsomething else.  But whoever targets Singaporeans,  our  laws\r\n\r\nwill apply to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clarification. In\r\n\r\nother  words, the Minister is saying that any website  within\r\n\r\nSingapore and can be prosecuted under Singapore law  will  be\r\n\r\nbrought  under  this  Bill.   Is  that  correct?   Not   only\r\n\r\npolitical websites with a Class Licence but any website?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The intention is to make the rules\r\n\r\nclear  for the main parties involved in the contest, in other\r\n\r\nwords, the party websites.  These are the areas we are mainly\r\n\r\nafter.   But  we  are aware also that some of  the  so-called\r\n\r\nneutral sites, eg, Think Centre, they are obviously political\r\n\r\nin  nature, their publications are slanted towards particular\r\n\r\nparties.   So we also have to rope those in.  Those  will  be\r\n\r\nour  main  targets.   At the other end,  there  will  be  the\r\n\r\nindividual  websites  which we are not concerned  about.   In\r\n\r\nbetween is a gray area.  So it is a bit difficult for  me  to\r\n\r\nbe  very  specific  now.  We will have to see  what  actually\r\n\r\nhappens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in other words,\r\n\r\nanything  can happen because the Minister does not know  what\r\n\r\nwill  happen.

Is that so?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The Government will be very\r\n\r\nreasonable  and  fair  in  whatever  action  it  takes.

Right now we are debating  it\r\n\r\nin  the  absence  of actual wording of the regulations.   The\r\n\r\nregulations will be fair, they are meant to maintain a  level\r\n\r\nplaying field, and we should wait for the regulations  before\r\n\r\nwe pass judgement.\r\n\r\nThe  intention is not to go after everybody.  We  think  that\r\n\r\nthe  campaigning  should be done by the party  sites  openly.\r\n\r\nStanding behind their platforms, their views, a lot of things\r\n\r\ncan  be  done on the Internet.  They can have chats,  forums,\r\n\r\nspeeches  and their views.  They can pick.  They cannot  have\r\n\r\npolitical  films, because these are disallowed.   Other  than\r\n\r\nthat, almost anything that you can think of is allowed.   But\r\n\r\nif  besides  that, there are other sites actively campaigning\r\n\r\nfor  a  particular  party, then we would  have  to  see  what\r\n\r\nactions we should take on those sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

If you are making clarifications, you have to  seek\r\n\r\nclarifications on something which the Minister has  said  and\r\n\r\nnot try to raise fresh points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore  he seeks clarification, can I just add to this  point\r\n\r\nthat  Mr  Lee  Yock  Suan was trying to explain?   This  Bill\r\n\r\ncovers  political parties and political sites as  defined  or\r\n\r\nregistered by SBA as political sites.  For example, the Think\r\n\r\nCentre has been gazetted as a political site and is therefore\r\n\r\ncovered by this Bill.   Anything else is not covered by  this\r\n\r\nBill.   That  is my understanding of it.  Mr Low asked  about\r\n\r\nTalkingcock.com.  Today it is not registered as  a  political\r\n\r\nsite,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot that I know of.  So it is not covered.  But should it  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in political discussions, should it be involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  way  that Think Centre has been involved, then  we  will\r\n\r\nconsider  including  it  as a political  site.   That  is  my\r\n\r\nunderstanding.  I understand that there is also  a  new  site\r\n\r\ncalled JamesGomez@yahoo or whatever it is.  If it is based in\r\n\r\nSingapore, doing the same thing as he did in Think Centre, we\r\n\r\nmay also consider gazetting that as a political site.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I seek a clarification?

The INVEST Plan will be established under  the  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  Uniformed Services Superannuation Bill 2001 which  I\r\n\r\nwill  move  afterwards.   The INVEST Plan  will  replace  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  contract and full CPF schemes of the  HUS  officers.\r\n\r\nIt  will also replace the Pension scheme of the Police Senior\r\n\r\nOfficers.   The  INVEST  Plan is similar  to  the  SAVER  and\r\n\r\nPremium  Plans  introduced  for  uniformed  officers  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces in 1998 and 2000 respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will allow Parliament to establish\r\n\r\nseparate  Government  funds to pay pensions,  gratuities  and\r\n\r\nother allowances in respect of any public service instead  of\r\n\r\nmeeting   the   payments  from  the  Pension  Fund   or   the\r\n\r\nConsolidated  Fund.

The\r\n\r\npresence of  capable Home Affairs Uniformed Services officers\r\n\r\nwill  help to maintain a stable environment needed to attract\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the HUS is able to execute its roles in\r\n\r\nmeeting  public security and safety needs, we need to attract\r\n\r\nand  retain good officers to join the Home Affairs  Uniformed\r\n\r\nServices.   It  is  with  this objective  in  mind  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home Affairs (MHA) commissioned a study  by  an\r\n\r\ninternational  consultancy firm to review  the  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nUniformed  Services career structures and  systems  in  April\r\n\r\n2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Affairs Uniformed Services Career Review aimed\r\n\r\nto  restructure the Home Affairs Uniformed Services career to\r\n\r\nensure  that  it  is  well positioned to meet  future  public\r\n\r\nsecurity  and safety needs.  It studied the career structure,\r\n\r\npay  and  benefits package, career management and performance\r\n\r\nmanagement of the HUS officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the recommendation to\r\n\r\nintroduce a super-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nannuation  scheme for HUS officers.  The scheme is  known  as\r\n\r\nthe  INVEST Plan.  The Plan will replace the Contract  scheme\r\n\r\nthat  is  currently  open to Home Affairs Uniformed  Services\r\n\r\nofficers in the Civil Defence, Prisons, Narcotics Service, as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the Police (Junior) Officers Service.  Officers  on\r\n\r\nthe   Full  CPF  Scheme  in  the  above  services  will  also\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  INVEST Plan.   They  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nreceive   Full  CPF  contributions  and  will  also   receive\r\n\r\nadditional  contributions credited into the  INVEST  Plan  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up a superannuation fund to help them transit  out  of\r\n\r\nservice  at the age of 50 or 55.   The Plan will also replace\r\n\r\nthe  Pension scheme of the Police (Senior) Officers  Service.\r\n\r\nThe  Plan  will  apply  to  all new  Home  Affairs  Uniformed\r\n\r\nServices  officers  from  1st October  2001.   Existing  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  Uniformed Services officers are given an  option  to\r\n\r\nconvert  to the INVEST Plan and have the accumulated benefits\r\n\r\nunder  their  existing schemes transferred to the  new  Plan.\r\n\r\nLet me explain the rationale of the INVEST Plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retirement age for new Home Affairs Uniformed\r\n\r\nServices  officers will be lowered by 5 years, in recognition\r\n\r\nof  the  rigorous requirements of the Home Affairs  Uniformed\r\n\r\nServices.   Being in a uniformed organisation,  HUS  officers\r\n\r\nare  required  to  be physically fit, agile  and  alert  when\r\n\r\ndischarging  their day-to-day duties.  For  instance,  Police\r\n\r\nofficers  need  to  be  agile and fit to  perform  patrolling\r\n\r\nduties,   which  include  physically  strenuous  tasks   like\r\n\r\npursuing   criminals.    Civil   Defence   officers   perform\r\n\r\noperational   duties  such  as  fire-fighting   and   rescue,\r\n\r\nemergency ambulance and hazardous materials mitigation, which\r\n\r\nrequire   considerable  physical  effort.   Similar  exacting\r\n\r\nphysical  fitness and mental alertness requirements apply  to\r\n\r\nofficers in the Prisons and Narcotics schemes of service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the increasing civilianisation and\r\n\r\noutsourcing of non-core functions will reduce the  number  of\r\n\r\ndesk-bound  administrative jobs.  This in  turn  reduces  the\r\n\r\ntraditional channel used to hold older officers  who  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger suited for rigorous, frontline work, till they retire.\r\n\r\nFor example, the number of desk-bound\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadministrative  jobs  in the Police force  will  decrease  to\r\n\r\nabout 10 percent in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus from 1st October 2001, all new officers joining the\r\n\r\nHome Affairs Uniformed Services will retire at age 50 if they\r\n\r\nretire  as  Junior Officers, and at age 55 if they retire  as\r\n\r\nSenior Officers.  Serving officers can choose to opt into the\r\n\r\nnew  scheme.   The  INVEST  Plan is to  help  these  officers\r\n\r\ntransit out of service into their second career.  Similar  to\r\n\r\nthe  SAVER and Premium Plans that have been introduced in the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Armed  Forces  (SAF),  the  INVEST  Plan   offers\r\n\r\nreasonable  superannuation terms to  uniformed  officers  who\r\n\r\nhave to retire earlier than other civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs has also taken the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to replace the Pension scheme for Police  Senior\r\n\r\nOfficers  with the INVEST Plan.  This is because  our  review\r\n\r\nfound  that  a  plan  which  builds up  officers'  retirement\r\n\r\nbenefits  through  making  monthly  contributions  into   the\r\n\r\nofficers'  accounts during the course of their careers,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  INVEST  Plan, is better able to meet  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nPolice  Senior  Officers, as compared to one  where  officers\r\n\r\nreceive  a  fixed quantum on retirement, such as the  Pension\r\n\r\nscheme.   This is also to make it consistent with our  Senior\r\n\r\nOfficers   in  the  other  Home  Affairs  Uniformed  Services\r\n\r\nSchemes.  We will then have uniformity in treatment,  instead\r\n\r\nof   differential  treatment  for  the  Home  Affairs  Senior\r\n\r\nOfficers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mechanism of the INVEST Plan is similar to the SAF's\r\n\r\nSAVER  and  Premium Plans.  Under the INVEST Plan,  the  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  Ministry  will  contribute  an  amount  based  on  a\r\n\r\npercentage  of  the officer's monthly salary into  an  INVEST\r\n\r\nRetirement  Account kept for the officer.  It is 7  3/4%  for\r\n\r\nJunior Officers and 6% for Senior Officers, starting from the\r\n\r\n7th year of service.  Because of the additional component  to\r\n\r\nreplace  pension, Police Senior Officers will  get  a  higher\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate, that is 11 3/4% from the  first  year  of\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Junior Officers will receive retention\r\n\r\npayments  in  a  separate  INVEST  Retention  Account.    The\r\n\r\nretention payments will be credited into the officer's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nRetention Account on satisfactory completion of each year  of\r\n\r\nservice, during the officer's first 10 years of service.  The\r\n\r\npayments  equal one month of salary for each year of  service\r\n\r\nduring  the  first  6 years.  In the 7th to  10th  year,  the\r\n\r\npayments  rise to 1 1/2  months of salary for  each  year  of\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds in the officers' Retirement and Retention\r\n\r\naccounts  will be pooled to form an investment fund known  as\r\n\r\nthe  INVEST  Fund.   The  INVEST  Fund  will  be  managed  by\r\n\r\nprofessional   fund   managers.   Based   on   returns   from\r\n\r\ninvestments,  dividends will be credited into the  individual\r\n\r\naccounts  of  each  officer.  An INVEST  Board  of  Trustees,\r\n\r\nchaired  by  the  Permanent Secretary, and comprising  senior\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  Ministry officials and  people  with  relevant\r\n\r\nexperience from the public and private sectors, will  oversee\r\n\r\nthe fund managers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated amounts in the INVEST accounts can be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  by  the officers progressively.   If  the  officer\r\n\r\nresigns  prematurely, the Ministry will retain  part  of  the\r\n\r\namount  in  the  officer's accounts.  The  officer  can  only\r\n\r\nwithdraw the full amount in his accounts if he serves a  full\r\n\r\ncareer  with  the  Home Affairs Uniformed Services,  when  he\r\n\r\nretires  at  age  50  or 55 for Junior  and  Senior  Officers\r\n\r\nrespectively.    The   Ministry   expects   the   progressive\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  feature of the INVEST Plan to enhance  retention,\r\n\r\nthus helping the Ministry to attract good quality officers to\r\n\r\njoin and remain with the Home Affairs Uniformed Services  for\r\n\r\na full career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Affairs Uniformed Services officers are,\r\n\r\ngenerally,  pleased with the review and the  enhancements  in\r\n\r\nthe  career management.  Junior Officers who have served more\r\n\r\nthan  10  years  and  who will be given a  one-off  retention\r\n\r\npayment  are  happy.   Briefings on the details  on  the  new\r\n\r\nscheme  of  service and the INVEST Retention  and  Retirement\r\n\r\nPlan  started  in mid-July, with individual consultation  for\r\n\r\nofficers  who  need  to discuss further  their  options.   In\r\n\r\naddition to information\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbooklets, officers were also given a projection software  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  compute  and compare projected benefits  under  the\r\n\r\ncurrent and the new terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the INVEST retirement plan where serving officers\r\n\r\nopt for earlier retirement age, officers decide based on what\r\n\r\nsuits  them  best,  taking  into account  their  age,  family\r\n\r\ncommitments  and  plans after retirement.   While  some  have\r\n\r\nexpressed concern about the limited second career choices  at\r\n\r\nage  55, others look forward to being able to start a  second\r\n\r\ncareer  after earlier retirement.  Officers are also  pleased\r\n\r\nwith  the possible additional source of savings available  at\r\n\r\nretirement from the retirement fund.  In general, the  INVEST\r\n\r\nRetirement  Plan has fared better among younger  officers  as\r\n\r\nofficers with 10 or less years to retirement feel that  their\r\n\r\ninvestment  is not likely to gain much in the short  span  of\r\n\r\ntime.   Ultimately, each serving officer chooses  what  suits\r\n\r\nhim best.  No serving officer is worse off than before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will provide the legislative framework to\r\n\r\nimplement  the  INVEST Plan.  It will also make consequential\r\n\r\namendments  to  the Pension Fund Act to allow  for  officers'\r\n\r\nbenefits accumulated under the Pension Fund to be transferred\r\n\r\nfrom the Pension Fund to the INVEST Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\"\r\n\r\n-  [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-one Minutes past Four o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
