Although  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority  possess  a  trade  skill,  this  has  not\r\n\r\ntranslated  into improvements in Singapore's construction\r\n\r\nproductivity.  Thus, the Government had introduced multi-skilling  and  enhanced  the skills  criteria  for  lower\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy.  This is to raise the overall  skill\r\n\r\nlevel  of  the foreign construction workforce and  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  industry's reliance on low-skilled workers.   Multi-skilled workers can be deployed for a wider range of jobs\r\n\r\nat  a  construction  site.   This  will  result  in  more\r\n\r\nefficient manpower utilisation and higher productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry and the BCA are mindful of the\r\n\r\nimpact  the changes may have on the industry.   Only  new\r\n\r\nforeign workers recruited after 1st January 2004 have  to\r\n\r\nmeet the new skills criteria to be eligible for the lower\r\n\r\nlevy.   Existing workers have a transition period of  two\r\n\r\nyears  until 1st January 2005 to re-qualify for the lower\r\n\r\nlevy.  They will continue to be eligible for the low levy\r\n\r\n(currently  at  $30 per month) until this date,  ie,  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  2005.  So, most ongoing contracts would  not  be\r\n\r\naffected.   With the long transition period,  contractors\r\n\r\nwould   also   have  sufficient  time  to  adjust   their\r\n\r\noperations and factor the changes in their tenders.  They\r\n\r\nshould  also  have sufficient lead-time  to  train  their\r\n\r\nworkers  to  acquire a second skill during  this  period.\r\n\r\nContracts  of  a longer duration that could  be  severely\r\n\r\naffected  will be considered on a case-by-case  basis  by\r\n\r\nBCA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following these changes, contractors should not\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  recruit  low  skill  foreign  construction\r\n\r\nworkers.   The sensible thing is to make greater  efforts\r\n\r\nto  recruit better-skilled and more experienced  workers.\r\n\r\nBusiness-wise, this is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetter  than recruiting low-skilled workers to be trained\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   While  such multi-skilled  workers  will\r\n\r\nexpect  higher  wages,  the lower levy  and  productivity\r\n\r\ngains will more than offset any higher wage cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, in view of this\r\n\r\nchange, will the Ministry continue to reduce the Man Year\r\n\r\nEntitlement  (MYE) as recommended by the Construction  21\r\n\r\nCommittee every year?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is\r\n\r\nyes.   Over  the longer term, we will still move  towards\r\n\r\ntightening  the  allocation  of  non-traditional   source\r\n\r\nworkers   under  the  Man  Year  Entitlement  scheme   to\r\n\r\ncontractors.  But in view of the slew of changes that has\r\n\r\nbeen introduced this year, we have decided that, for this\r\n\r\nyear,  we  will suspend any further revision of  the  Man\r\n\r\nYear  Entitlement scheme.  But, starting from next  year,\r\n\r\nwe  will  review the situation and if, in fact, there  is\r\n\r\nstill  room for further reduction, which we believe  that\r\n\r\nthere  would  be, then we will carry on  to  achieve  the\r\n\r\ntarget  set  by  Construction 21, which is  to  half  the\r\n\r\ndependency  on  foreign  construction  workers  within  a\r\n\r\ncertain timeframe or faster, if we can achieve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INTERNATIONAL ENTERPRISE SINGAPORE BOARD</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the International Enterprise Singapore\r\n\r\nBoard Act (Chapter 143B of the 2002 Revised Edition)  and\r\n\r\nto  make  consequential and related amendments  to  other\r\n\r\nwritten laws\",\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\npresented  by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong); read the First time; to  be\r\n\r\nread  a  Second time after the Committee of Supply debate\r\n\r\non  the Estimates of Expenditure for FY 2003/2004, and to\r\n\r\nbe printed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CUSTOMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Customs Act (Chapter 70 of the 2001\r\n\r\nRevised Edition) and to make consequential amendments  to\r\n\r\ncertain other written laws\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of President signified; presented  by  Mr\r\n\r\nLee Hsien Loong; read the First time; to be read a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond  time after the Committee of Supply debate on  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  of  Expenditure for FY 2003/2004,  and  to  be\r\n\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEBATE ON BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, an\r\n\r\nadditional  day, namely, Wednesday, 12th March  2003,  be\r\n\r\nallotted for the debate on the motion for the approval of\r\n\r\nthe  financial policy of the Government for FY  2003/2004\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Deputy Prime Minister  and  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance on 28th February 2003.\"  -  [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question\r\n\r\n[28th February, 2003].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the financial year 1st April, 2003 to 31st\r\n\r\nMarch,  2004.\".  -  [Deputy Prime Minister  and  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank  you for allowing me to start this  important\r\n\r\nand landmark Budget Debate for FY 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is different from the norm in the\r\n\r\npast  years.   It  contains Government's  strategies  and\r\n\r\nplans  over  the  longer term based on its  response  and\r\n\r\ngeneral  acceptance  of the Economic  Review  Committee's\r\n\r\nReport.   At  the same time, as a standard practice,  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement  spelt  out the Government's  immediate\r\n\r\nfiscal  and monetary plans, tax changes and action  plans\r\n\r\nfor  the new financial year.  This two-pronged long  term\r\n\r\nand  short  term discourse of the Government's strategies\r\n\r\nand plans does require some re-orientation to readers and\r\n\r\nobservers,  trying  to  understand  better  this   year's\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the same vein as the Budget announcement, I\r\n\r\nshall  also  structure my comments on this year's  Budget\r\n\r\ninto two sections, covering first the ERC Report and then\r\n\r\nthe FY 2003 Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the ERC Report. This is a monumental\r\n\r\nexercise involving about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1,000 persons directly involved in sub-committees and\r\n\r\nworking groups over a period of one year.  I liken this\r\n\r\nexercise to 1,000 cooks labouring together to create a\r\n\r\nSingaporean favourite dish, eg, the char kway teow, with\r\n\r\nDPM Lee as our chief cook.  Now, this dish is cooked and\r\n\r\nbeing served to the people.  What are the responses and\r\n\r\nreactions so far?  Are the people satisfied? I believe\r\n\r\nthe verdict is, like all recipes, it cannot cater to all\r\n\r\ntastes.  Some like it, some do not.  And some do not\r\n\r\ncare!  So, not everybody can be fully satisfied. Some\r\n\r\nwant extra hot, some like it sweet.  Everybody wants more\r\n\r\ngoodies in it, but no one wants it bitter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have said that the final ERC Report is\r\n\r\nnot exciting. Nothing new or phenomenal has resulted from\r\n\r\nit.   There  is  no  grand vision.  Where  are  the  bold\r\n\r\nmeasures?   Generally, no excitement.  I  have  to  admit\r\n\r\nthat I tend to share some of these sentiments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on balance, I wish to point out that the\r\n\r\nERC  Report has accomplished  its mission very well.   No\r\n\r\none  should  belittle the profound effort,  the  numerous\r\n\r\nvalid  recommendations and the vital conclusions  of  the\r\n\r\nERC   Report.   One  thousand  of  the  best  minds,  top\r\n\r\nmanagers, businessmen and political leaders had, in great\r\n\r\nearnestness, reviewed all the major economic and economic-related  policies that literally left no stones unturned.\r\n\r\nIt is also correct that those stones that are found to be\r\n\r\nall right are put back  -  no need to change for change's\r\n\r\nsake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The involvement of the large number of people has\r\n\r\nserved   the   purpose   of   bringing   together   wider\r\n\r\nparticipation  of many people in charting the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  Report  has  been  most  comprehensive,\r\n\r\ncovering every economic and related issue.  I support, in\r\n\r\nprinciple, all the recommended policy changes with regard\r\n\r\nto  taxation,  CPF, manufacturing and service  industries\r\n\r\ndevelopment, human capital and others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, allow me to spell out my specific\r\n\r\ncomments  regarding certain recommendations  in  the  ERC\r\n\r\nReport.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, concern on depressing wages and land values.\r\n\r\nA main thrust that appears to come across strongly in the\r\n\r\nERC  Report is that, henceforth, the Government wants  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the factors of production, ie. land, rentals, wages\r\n\r\nand  other  operating costs low.  This is a well-intended\r\n\r\nobjective.  I have no quarrel with that.  But I  wish  to\r\n\r\nremark that we cannot artificially hold down prices.   We\r\n\r\ndo  wish  to hold down increases in Government rates  and\r\n\r\nfees,  wherever possible, but many costs, such as  wages,\r\n\r\nland  and  rentals, are dictated by the market,  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  affluence  of  the people.   Every  year,  every\r\n\r\nemployee  wants to see an increase in his take-home  pay,\r\n\r\nso  as  to at least match or better inflation and  rising\r\n\r\ncosts  of  expenses.  They want to see  improving  living\r\n\r\nstandards  for themselves and their families.   How  then\r\n\r\ncan we intentionally hold down prices?   Moreover, it  is\r\n\r\nnot correct to artificially press down values.  Do we not\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  we cannot compete with our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  especially against China and India  based  on\r\n\r\nlow production cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder what happened to the previously much\r\n\r\npromoted policy of going for higher technology and higher\r\n\r\nvalue  added products, and to promote our brain  services\r\n\r\nsector.  Not much has been said in the ERC Report on this\r\n\r\naspect.   Is it an understood issue or is it deliberately\r\n\r\nde-emphasised in the Report?  If it is intentional, it is\r\n\r\nuseful to explain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, concern on deflation. In line with my doubt\r\n\r\non  the  wisdom of focusing on depressing  the  costs  of\r\n\r\nproduction, and therefore depressing values, I also  have\r\n\r\na  worry on the underlying deflationary effects of such a\r\n\r\npolicy.   It is therefore timely that I read in a  report\r\n\r\nwarning    about   \"Overshooting   deflation    threatens\r\n\r\nSingapore\" in the Business Times on Saturday,  8th  March\r\n\r\n2003,  in  a  study  by the US investment  bank,  Goldman\r\n\r\nSachs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the report, Goldman Sachs forewarned that, in\r\n\r\nrecent years since the Asian financial crisis, there have\r\n\r\nbeen a series of negative shocks which add up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  largest  deflationary demand  shock  the  modern\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy has ever faced.  Some of  the  factors\r\n\r\ncited are :\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 12% deterioration in terms of trade since 1996,\r\n\r\nie, after the Asian financial crisis;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Rise in regional political risk premium and\r\n\r\nlower direct investment to the region;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Emergence of competition from China; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Restructuring of Government-linked companies\r\n\r\ninvolving lay-offs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add to the above list that there is also the\r\n\r\nuncertainty  in the domestic sector with the recent  high\r\n\r\nprofile  lay-offs in the Government  sector  -   of   PSA\r\n\r\nCorporation  and HDB.  So, I am indeed very fearful  that\r\n\r\nif  it  is  the professed intention of the Government  to\r\n\r\nkeep  wages  and land values low, it will further  dampen\r\n\r\nthe  already  depressed mood of the  people,  leading  to\r\n\r\nlower  domestic  spending  which,  in  turn,  will  cause\r\n\r\ndomestic  demand to spiral downwards into a  deflationary\r\n\r\nloop.   I strongly urge the Government to look into  this\r\n\r\nconcern of threat of deflation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, changing mindset to promote entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nAnother  key  thrust  of the ERC  Report  is  to  promote\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,  so as to cultivate an  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nnation.  One of the three main tenets of the Report is to\r\n\r\nremake  Singapore  into \"a creative  and  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nnation  willing to take risks to create fresh  businesses\r\n\r\nand  blaze  new paths to success\".  I like this principle\r\n\r\nand  I  fully support it.  However, I feel that  this  is\r\n\r\neasier  said  than done.  It requires substantial  effort\r\n\r\nand  total  commitment  from all.   Our  people  and  our\r\n\r\nchildren  are too used to being led, guided and spoon-fed\r\n\r\nby  the  Government.  We have to break  out  of  the  old\r\n\r\nmould.   We  need  a fundamental mindset  change,  to  be\r\n\r\ncreative and take initiative.  But can we?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote an observation that shows that we have\r\n\r\nan arduous task to change\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people's  mindset, though we must.   Someone  called\r\n\r\nthis  the  No U-Turn Syndrome (or \"NUTS\", in short).   In\r\n\r\nthe US, the general traffic rule is that a driver can  do\r\n\r\nU-turns along any road unless specifically prohibited  by\r\n\r\nNo  U-turn  signs.   In Singapore,  it  is  the  reverse.\r\n\r\nMotorists   are   not  allowed  to  do   U-turns   unless\r\n\r\nspecifically permitted at locations where permitted signs\r\n\r\nare  shown.   That  means that they cannot  do  anything,\r\n\r\nunless  the authorities say \"yes\".  This mindset of  NUTS\r\n\r\n(or   No   U-Turn  Syndrome)  is  so  ingrained  in   our\r\n\r\nSingaporean mentality that we do not dare to do  anything\r\n\r\nunless we get a \"yes\" from the Government.  How then  can\r\n\r\nwe promote initiative and creativity?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite another traffic rule example. In the\r\n\r\nUS,  where  traffic  is right hand drive,  motorists  are\r\n\r\nallowed to turn right at all signalised junctions on  red\r\n\r\nlight,  provided the traffic is clear; and  unless  there\r\n\r\nare  signs  prohibiting  this  right  turning.   But,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it is again the reverse.  We cannot turn  left\r\n\r\nat  signalised junctions on red.  However,  a  few  years\r\n\r\nago, LTA allowed the rule of \"Turn Left On Red\" or \"TLOR\"\r\n\r\nat  some minor roads.  The shocking thing is that I  have\r\n\r\nseen  with my own eyes, motorists who dare not make  left\r\n\r\nturns  on  red, even though there are signages permitting\r\n\r\nit,  and  the  traffic is clear!  This is the Singaporean\r\n\r\nmentality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to get our people to be more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial.   I  believe  the  Government,  being  a\r\n\r\ncaring parent, must learn how to \"let go\".  We should cut\r\n\r\ndown  on rules and red tapes.  We have to give the people\r\n\r\ntheir  choices to make.  We have to get out of the  habit\r\n\r\nof  planning every minuscule matter for our people.  Give\r\n\r\nthem more avenues to express themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on GST, in view of the budget deficit and the\r\n\r\nestimated  $650  million cost for  deferment  of  1%  GST\r\n\r\nincrease   for  one  year,  I  support  the  Government's\r\n\r\nintention  to proceed to implement the second  instalment\r\n\r\nof  the next 1% increase in GST in January 2004.   It  is\r\n\r\nprudent  not  to incur higher deficit due to insufficient\r\n\r\nrevenue  collections  if  the GST  increase  is  deferred\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF, I agree with the recommendation to defer the\r\n\r\nrestoration of the balance 4% CPF for another two  years.\r\n\r\nThis  will  enable companies to save on  lower  operating\r\n\r\ncosts  and better able to sustain their viability  during\r\n\r\nthis  depressed business environment.  However, I do want\r\n\r\nto voice my concern for those workers most affected, such\r\n\r\nas  those  in  the older age group of 50  years  old  and\r\n\r\nabove.   This  age  group will not  have  their  CPF  cut\r\n\r\nrestored,  and will have to contribute more to their  CPF\r\n\r\nSpecial  and Medisave accounts.  The lowering of the  CPF\r\n\r\nsalary ceiling from $6,000 to $5,000 will also mean  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  receive less contribution to their  CPF  from\r\n\r\ntheir employers.  Then, they will have to face the double\r\n\r\nblow  of  higher expenses due to the further increase  in\r\n\r\nGST  totalling 2%, and, of course, general living expense\r\n\r\nincreases  which  are inevitable.  Therefore,  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group and the higher age group will  continue  to\r\n\r\nneed  support  from the Government in the  form  of  S&CC\r\n\r\nrebates, rental and utility rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the next step for the ERC. As I said\r\n\r\nearlier,  the  ERC Report is very wide and comprehensive.\r\n\r\nWhat  I find lacking are the specific recommendations  on\r\n\r\nthe  implementation details to achieve the stated  plans.\r\n\r\nI  can concede that it will be too thick to spell out the\r\n\r\nactual implementation plans for every recommendation.  It\r\n\r\nis,  therefore,  left  to  the  relevant  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nagencies to follow through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report states that the Ministry of Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry   (MTI)   will  co-ordinate  the  follow-through\r\n\r\nactions.  Whilst I do not doubt the capability of MTI  to\r\n\r\nundertake this task, I do wish to voice out aloud why  it\r\n\r\nis  not  deemed important enough for this  matter  to  be\r\n\r\nmonitored  henceforth by the Prime Minister's Office,  or\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister's Office.  I  feel  that  the\r\n\r\noverseeing  body  should be either PMO,  or  by  the  DPM\r\n\r\nhimself.  In any case, he is the Chairman of the ERC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rationale for high level monitoring is similar\r\n\r\nto  the  new Ministerial Committee on Services.  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport  the  formation of this Ministerial Committee  on\r\n\r\nServices to oversee the development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   major  new  services,  such  as  health,  media  and\r\n\r\neducation.  The reason is that the work crosses over many\r\n\r\nMinistries  with  inter-ministerial  issues.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  ERC recommendations cut across Ministries.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  a  supra-Ministerial person  being  in-charge\r\n\r\nshould spur smoother and speedier implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to move on to the policies\r\n\r\nand  measures announced in the Budget for FY 2003.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave said earlier, the difficulty with this year's Budget\r\n\r\ndebate  is that we have to shift our orientation  between\r\n\r\nthe  long  term issues spelt out in the ERC  Report,  and\r\n\r\nthen  re-focus  back  to the short term  matters  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be one reason why the reception to the\r\n\r\nERC  Report has been lukewarm, as some attention  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  has  been diverted to short-term impact  measures\r\n\r\nannounced in the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on focus on short term issues and threats. We\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  ERC Report is a very important  landmark\r\n\r\ndocument.   It  spells out fully the total blueprint  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's future survival.  However, the general public\r\n\r\nis  more  focused  on  their immediate  problems.   Their\r\n\r\nimmediate  concerns are unemployment, firstly;  then  the\r\n\r\nuncertainty  of  domestic economic recovery,  diminishing\r\n\r\nasset  values, the looming threat of war in Iraq and  the\r\n\r\nfall-outs  of  war,  the  unclear US  economic  recovery,\r\n\r\nterrorism, threats of China and India, quarrels with  our\r\n\r\nnearest  neighbour Malaysia, and the unclear  geo-politic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  Indonesia.  Looking  through  this  long\r\n\r\nlist,  there  is  indeed reason for our  people  to  feel\r\n\r\ndeeply  worried.  Many are experiencing a sense  of  loss\r\n\r\nand   despondency.    The  road   ahead   is   hazy   and\r\n\r\ndirectionless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning back to the Budget for FY 2003, the\r\n\r\nBudget  will see a deficit of $900 million.  This is  the\r\n\r\nthird  year  of  deficit in a row.  It  is  a  cause  for\r\n\r\nconcern on Government's principle of budget prudence.  We\r\n\r\nhave budget deficit for three years in a row.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I can accept the announcement that\r\n\r\nthere  will be no corporate and personal income tax  cuts\r\n\r\nand  no income tax rebate for FY 2003.  To make such cuts\r\n\r\nnow will mean that there will be a larger budget deficit.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  would  urge the Minister  for  Finance  that\r\n\r\nshould  good times return next year, please do not forget\r\n\r\nto  reward  the hardworking tax-paying people  by  giving\r\n\r\nthem some income tax rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the world and domestic\r\n\r\neconomies remain poor for a few years, I wonder how would\r\n\r\nthe  Government meet its stated intention to  cut  direct\r\n\r\ntaxes  to  20% by 2005, without incurring further  budget\r\n\r\ndeficits or introducing higher GST increase.  The  latter\r\n\r\nmove, of course, will be very unpopular.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although we have a deficit budget\r\n\r\nfor the new year, there is also a disappointment that the\r\n\r\nnew  Budget  is not stimulative enough for  the  domestic\r\n\r\neconomy.   I do admit that I seem to be speaking  with  a\r\n\r\nforked  tongue.  Just a moment ago, I expressed  concerns\r\n\r\nabout  a continuing budget deficit, and now I seem to  be\r\n\r\nurging  the Government to spend more to create  a  higher\r\n\r\nbudget deficit to stimulate the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. Although we said that Singapore has\r\n\r\nincurred  three years of deficits, on closer examination,\r\n\r\nthe  deficits are still very small.  In FY 2001, a  total\r\n\r\ndeficit  of  about $2.8 billion was incurred.   This  was\r\n\r\nabout  10% of the total Government revenue for that year.\r\n\r\nThis deficit was high but it was needed to stimulate  the\r\n\r\neconomy  against a recession then.  Last  year's  deficit\r\n\r\nfor FY 2002 has been revised and estimated to be a modest\r\n\r\n$0.1  billion or $100 million, versus the original figure\r\n\r\nof  $0.9 billion, or $900 million.  So, FY 2002 is nearly\r\n\r\na balanced budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for FY 2003, the estimated deficit is $0.9\r\n\r\nbillion.   This  is  only  3% of the  total  Government's\r\n\r\noperating  revenue collections for the new year amounting\r\n\r\nto  $29.6  billion.  For the sake of getting our  economy\r\n\r\nout  of the rut, and to give a booster to the people  and\r\n\r\nbusiness confidence, I would advocate a higher deficit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor this new financial year.  I believe we can afford it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, it is thought that a deficit budget is\r\n\r\nexpansionary.  I would like to point out that this is not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  true.  It depends, to a major extent,  where\r\n\r\nthe  budget  funds  are  allocated.   If  funds  are  not\r\n\r\nearmarked  for expansionary projects, like infrastructure\r\n\r\nand  growth,  but to longer term projects like  education\r\n\r\nand  social  targets, then a deficit budget  may  not  be\r\n\r\nexpansionary.   This year's budget may be in  a  deficit,\r\n\r\nbut   I   am  not  sure  whether  it  is  a  sufficiently\r\n\r\nexpansionary budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make matters worse, we understand that the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   directed  Ministries   to   cut   down\r\n\r\nexpenditures  on  projects and various  spending.   Would\r\n\r\nthis  instruction of the Ministry of Finance be  counter-expansionary?  We are beginning to hear feedback from the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  companies that they are receiving  fewer\r\n\r\ncontracts  from the Government.  If this  trend  were  to\r\n\r\ncontinue,  would  it not aggravate an  already  depressed\r\n\r\neconomy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwhether  this  year's  Budget  is  indeed  a  stimulative\r\n\r\nbudget.   What  are  the  measures  to  kick  start   the\r\n\r\nsputtering  domestic  economy?   Where  are  the   engine\r\n\r\nboosters?   We do not have tax cuts, no pump priming  was\r\n\r\nmentioned,   and   no   announcement   about   additional\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  spending.   So,  how  are  we  going   to\r\n\r\nstimulate the economy to grow?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to what I call the \"crutch mentality\",\r\n\r\nthere is another dichotomy that I wish to raise.  This is\r\n\r\nwith regard to the continuation of the use of rebates and\r\n\r\nwelfare benefits to help the lower income group and  less\r\n\r\nprivileged  to overcome the various higher  indirect  tax\r\n\r\nburdens  such  as  GST increase and the  higher  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  expenses.  I am afraid that the long term use  of\r\n\r\nrebates,  reliefs  and benefits will  lead  to  a  crutch\r\n\r\nmentality of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, we have to gradually wean the less able\r\n\r\nsegment  of  the  people to take care of  themselves  and\r\n\r\nbecome less\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndependent on welfare and financial aid.  The same applies\r\n\r\nto  the  young.   This  contention is  in  line  with  my\r\n\r\nprevious  point  that  to build a  truly  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nnation, the people have to learn to be less dependent  on\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  before  we  can  truly  create  a  new\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial and vibrant nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message must be made clear - the Government will\r\n\r\nhelp  you  today,  but you must learn  to  take  care  of\r\n\r\nyourself tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are living in very uncertain\r\n\r\ntimes.   The sense of despondency is actually worse  this\r\n\r\nyear  compared  to last year.  I recall that  during  the\r\n\r\nbudget  debate last year, my Backbench colleagues  and  I\r\n\r\nhad  already  warned about this sense of doom  and  gloom\r\n\r\nprevailing  in Singapore then.  With higher unemployment,\r\n\r\nannouncements of layoffs, and fear of the looming war  in\r\n\r\nIraq,  the general sense of despondency is higher  today.\r\n\r\nThere  is a general sense of haplessness as many  factors\r\n\r\nare totally outside our control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to boost the confidence of the people. This\r\n\r\nis  a priority task.  Our people have to first understand\r\n\r\nand  get  used to a future where double digit growth  and\r\n\r\ncontinuing tax cuts, more NSS and ERS shares will not  be\r\n\r\neasy   to   come   by.   We  have  to  re-orientate   our\r\n\r\nexpectations   of  growth.   We  have  to  accept   that,\r\n\r\nhenceforth, each incremental achievement requires greater\r\n\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, sometimes, I cannot help but have the feeling\r\n\r\nthat we do tend to over-plan in Singapore.  I recall that\r\n\r\nwe  had  in the past the Vision 1999, The Next  Lap  and,\r\n\r\nmore  recently, the Singapore 21 Plan.  We also  had  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Committee in 1985.  It seems like deja  vu.   No\r\n\r\nwonder there is muted enthusiasm to this ERC Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do wish to commend the Government for\r\n\r\nlaunching  and completing the Economic Review Committee's\r\n\r\nReport.   The people have been held in suspense,  pending\r\n\r\nthe  release of the ERC Report.  Now that the ERC Report,\r\n\r\nas well as the Budget, is announced, we should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmove  on.   The Government has laid down the clear  long-term  goals.   The new fiscal and monetary policies  have\r\n\r\nbeen spelt out.  The new directions have been set.  It is\r\n\r\ntime to get on with the business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whatever is happening around us\r\n\r\ncurrently in the world, Singapore has to find its  place.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot foresee and plan ahead for everything.  If  we\r\n\r\ncan  be  nimble and creative, we shall always be able  to\r\n\r\nfind  our place in this world.  The Government must  show\r\n\r\nstrong  leadership in difficult times.  The  people  must\r\n\r\nrespond and shoulder its share of the burden.  Let us put\r\n\r\non  our  hard  hats and boots and take up  the  changkol.\r\n\r\nTogether,  let us start ploughing, to re-build  a  better\r\n\r\nfuture for our children as best as we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you  for allowing me to join in the debate.   Sir,\r\n\r\ntoday,  I  would like to talk on three points.  First  of\r\n\r\nall,  my assessment of the Budget - what it achieved  and\r\n\r\nwhat  it failed to achieve and what more could have  been\r\n\r\ndone.    Second,   I  would  like  to  comment   on   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the ERC recommendations and, finally, I\r\n\r\nwill  touch on the issue of entrepreneurship and  what  I\r\n\r\nfeel  will  be the strategies needed to be successful  in\r\n\r\nthis area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My assessment of the Budget, as I listened to the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister delivering it, was that it seemed to  be\r\n\r\na  balanced  budget, addressing both the short  term  and\r\n\r\nimmediate issues as well as the longer term issues needed\r\n\r\nto  address  the restructuring of the Singapore  economy.\r\n\r\nAs I analysed the Budget further, I actually saw very few\r\n\r\nnew  initiatives to make this Budget exciting  enough  to\r\n\r\ncatch the attention of long-term investors.  But before I\r\n\r\ntouch on this point, I would like to square off some very\r\n\r\nobvious   things   that,   in  my   opinion,   were   the\r\n\r\ndisappointments of this Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, this Budget did not address the\r\n\r\nconcerns  of the middle group of Singaporeans.  While  we\r\n\r\ndid take care of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   lower  income  Singaporeans  through  the   various\r\n\r\nrebates,  it did nothing to assure the biggest  group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  may have more assets  than  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome Singaporeans, but who, in the short term, have the\r\n\r\nsame concerns which worry them and, that is, the loss  of\r\n\r\njobs and the short-term financial help that they can  get\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government.  I feel that the  Minister  should\r\n\r\nhave  done  much more to assure Singaporeans  that  their\r\n\r\nproblems will be addressed in times of difficulties.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  should have put in place a temporary scheme  to\r\n\r\nmake cash accessible to such Singaporeans, for example, a\r\n\r\n1%  tax reduction could have helped these people in tough\r\n\r\ntimes and these are the people who are paying tax and who\r\n\r\nmay have lost their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is the budget deficit, in my\r\n\r\nopinion,  is hardly a deficit.  It seems to me  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister tried very hard to end up with a deficit  budget\r\n\r\nby  making huge special transfers in the three  areas  of\r\n\r\nERS,  Lifelong Learning Fund and Medical Endowment  Fund.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I do not see how the year 2003 Budget will end\r\n\r\nup in a deficit.  Again, we are making special transfers,\r\n\r\nand we are forecasting a lower NII and we did not seem to\r\n\r\nhave  fully  accounted for the 1% GST  increase  and  the\r\n\r\nspecial  income coming by way of more COEs expected.   So\r\n\r\nif  we  had  spent a bit more in trying to help companies\r\n\r\nand  individuals  in difficulties, perhaps  that  deficit\r\n\r\nwould have been a welcomed deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what about the long term cost competitiveness of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  Has the Minister missed out looking  at  this\r\n\r\nserious  recommendation, made not only by  the  ERC,  but\r\n\r\nalso  by  the many, many committees before the ERC,  like\r\n\r\nthe   SME21,   the   T21  and  the  Cost  Competitiveness\r\n\r\nCommittee?   I  feel  that the Minister  again  lost  the\r\n\r\ngolden  opportunity  to address once  and  for  all  this\r\n\r\ncritical issue that is sinking the Singapore economy.   I\r\n\r\nam   really  disappointed  at  the  seemingly  short-term\r\n\r\nthinking  of the Government, especially on this important\r\n\r\narea  of  cost competitiveness.  And why do I  say  short\r\n\r\nterm?    The  measures  like  temporary  rental  rebates,\r\n\r\ntemporary property tax rebates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   temporary   CPF  cuts  do  nothing  in   instilling\r\n\r\nconfidence  among  longer  term investors  that,  indeed,\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  still remain competitive  not  only  two\r\n\r\nyears  from now, but also 10 years or 20 years from  now.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  current  approach just  drives  investors\r\n\r\nharder  to  move  out faster while they  can,  while  the\r\n\r\nrebates  are  still in place.  As a serious  investor,  I\r\n\r\nknow that I have to worry that in six months, rentals and\r\n\r\nproperty tax will go up again and that the CPF will again\r\n\r\ngo  up in two years.  The thought process will surely  be\r\n\r\nto  encourage  companies to prepare to  move  out  before\r\n\r\ncosts  once  again increase when the regime of  temporary\r\n\r\nrebates and temporary increases run out and go back to  a\r\n\r\nsteady state of higher costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all the efforts of all the committees I\r\n\r\nmentioned  will  not  go in vain  and  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will overcome this inertia and  get  down  to\r\n\r\naddressing the cost issue seriously.  The ideas  are  all\r\n\r\nthere - differential land pricing, structural changes  in\r\n\r\nthe   wage   system,  levies,  fees,  charges  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and utilities, logistics and telecommunication\r\n\r\ncharges.   We have enough data to show that Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnot competitive in all these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the issue of implementation of the ERC. We\r\n\r\nall  know  that  many Singaporeans were involved  in  the\r\n\r\nabove  process  of  deriving the ERC recommendations.   I\r\n\r\nmust  admit  that  there was some skepticism  among  some\r\n\r\npeople involved in the process and a comment which summed\r\n\r\nup the feeling went like this:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I have been asked to give my feedback many, many\r\n\r\ntimes before for so many years.  What is the point?   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not listen and does not  believe  in  us\r\n\r\nanyway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is  a true quote coming from a few  prominent\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  To convince them, the argument that all of\r\n\r\nus  who were involved in this process was that, this time\r\n\r\nround,  the Government has realised that there is a  need\r\n\r\nto  change  for the survival of Singapore and  everyone's\r\n\r\ninput  was  needed.  The outcome has been a lot  of  hard\r\n\r\nwork by many, and the many recommendations to remake  the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the whole, the recommendations have been\r\n\r\nbold  and  will make a big difference, there are  certain\r\n\r\nareas  which  could have been better dealt with.   First,\r\n\r\nthe  impression that we have is: are we really  re-tuning\r\n\r\nor  refining  the economy?  We were promised  that  there\r\n\r\nwere  no  sacred  cows and that no stones  will  be  left\r\n\r\nunturned in this whole exercise.  The outcome in a number\r\n\r\nof  areas,  which I felt could have made an  even  bigger\r\n\r\ndifference,  was  not  changed.   The  ERC   could   have\r\n\r\nexercised  greater will power to make bolder  changes  in\r\n\r\ncertain areas.  Unfortunately, the impression many people\r\n\r\nhave  is that all we have done is once again to just make\r\n\r\ntweaks  in  certain  areas  when  we  should  have   made\r\n\r\nfundamental  changes  to turn things  around.   When  the\r\n\r\nwhole exercise started, we talked about the remaking  and\r\n\r\nrestructuring of our economy.  It now appears more like a\r\n\r\nrefining  and re-tuning exercise in certain areas.   Yes,\r\n\r\nwe  did  pick the stones and place them back in the  same\r\n\r\nplace  or  in  some  other place.  We missed  the  golden\r\n\r\nopportunity to make much needed changes to the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me back up my argument with a few examples.\r\n\r\nFirst  of all, the tax system.  We have been touting  the\r\n\r\ntax changes as a major structural change, but as far as I\r\n\r\ncan  see,  there was no real change in the  system.   The\r\n\r\nreal  big change happened when the Government implemented\r\n\r\nthe   GST   system,  I  believe,  in   1994.    The   ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendations merely reaffirmed the 1994  changes.   So\r\n\r\nthe  ERC's recommendation of a reduction of personal  and\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax rate was long overdue anyway.   It  should\r\n\r\nhave come down drastically the day we implemented the GST\r\n\r\nchanges.   The  tax  changes, in  my  opinion,  were  not\r\n\r\nradical enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is that of the CPF. It is\r\n\r\nbecoming  a habit now to tweak the CPF rate in  times  of\r\n\r\ncrisis.   While I am not against this to help us  in  the\r\n\r\nshort  term, this does not give us comfort that  we  have\r\n\r\ngotten  to the root cause of the problem and that we  are\r\n\r\njust  addressing  the symptoms.  Is it  not  sufficiently\r\n\r\nclear that we have a structural problem with the CPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem?   We  should  have worked  on  a  more  permanent\r\n\r\nsolution, perhaps a lower contribution from employers and\r\n\r\ncompensated by alternated retirement and medical schemes.\r\n\r\nHad  we  made bolder changes, we may never have to fiddle\r\n\r\nwith the CPF contributions now and then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final example is one of land prices, and in\r\n\r\nthis  topic,  I tend to defer from Mr Leong.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  high cost of property, particularly industrial\r\n\r\nland,  is  a big issue.  To me, this is one of  the  most\r\n\r\nserious  structural problems, other than the  wage  which\r\n\r\ndirectly     affects     Singapore's     competitiveness,\r\n\r\nparticularly in areas of manufacturing.  So while we  may\r\n\r\ntalk  about  moving  low value-added  activities  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore and trying to bring in more high-tech and  high\r\n\r\nvalue-added activities in Singapore, the problem  is  the\r\n\r\nimage that we have created for ourselves is that we are a\r\n\r\nplace  where business activity is going to cost companies\r\n\r\na  lot of money.  It is a high-cost country.  And I  have\r\n\r\npersonally  visited a customer about three weeks  ago  in\r\n\r\nthe US, trying to bring in what I thought was a high-tech\r\n\r\nactivity  into Singapore, and the answer I got from  them\r\n\r\nwas  \"We will probably not be coming into Singapore.  But\r\n\r\nif  you can promise to do it in China or some other  low-cost  countries for me, I will move my high-tech activity\r\n\r\nthere.\"  The problem we suffer is that the image that  we\r\n\r\nhave created for ourselves is one of a high-cost country.\r\n\r\nSo we really need to fix this problem once and for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is on the implementation of the ERC\r\n\r\nReport's  recommendations and roadmap.  All of us  agreed\r\n\r\nthat the ERC exercise was a key and necessary initiative.\r\n\r\nBut,  in  my  opinion, we reacted a bit too late.   There\r\n\r\nwere  already a few signals that we could have picked  up\r\n\r\nhad  we been more attentive.  We could have reacted  much\r\n\r\nearlier.   The  few  signals were  the  bursting  of  the\r\n\r\nproperty bubble in 1996, the Asian financial crisis,  the\r\n\r\nemergence  of China and India and the flow of  FDIs  into\r\n\r\nChina.   These are all new things.  We could have reacted\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyway, now that we have identified so many\r\n\r\ninitiatives, including some considered taboo in the past,\r\n\r\nwe  should now roll up our sleeves and start implementing\r\n\r\nthem  quickly, a point that Mr Leong made  earlier.   The\r\n\r\nERC  should not end up as an academic exercise.  Too many\r\n\r\nimportant people have set aside their valuable time to be\r\n\r\ninvolved and we cannot risk disappointing them and  again\r\n\r\nfailing  to  implement  the  recommendations  decisively.\r\n\r\nMore  importantly, we cannot risk failing  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.  The reason I am bringing this up is because, in\r\n\r\nthe  past, we have undergone similar exercises  with  the\r\n\r\nlikes  of  the  S21, SME21, Retail 21 and the  many  '21'\r\n\r\ninitiatives.  For some of these exercises, we were big on\r\n\r\nplans,  but  short  on  actions.   We  risk  losing   the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of the key stakeholders of Singapore,  should\r\n\r\nwe   fail   in  the  implementation.    The   number   of\r\n\r\nrecommendations is overwhelming and, if not handled  well\r\n\r\nand  not  implemented systematically, we could  lose  the\r\n\r\nintended impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I read in the papers recently about\r\n\r\nSingapore  climbing up one notch among the most expensive\r\n\r\ncities  in  the  world compared to the  year  before,  we\r\n\r\nactually became more expensive and not less expensive  by\r\n\r\none  notch.  My heart sank simply because it goes to show\r\n\r\nthat  we  have not moved fast enough in our restructuring\r\n\r\nexercise.   The  second concern I have is  that,  in  our\r\n\r\nattempt  to  restructure, are we doing this in isolation?\r\n\r\nWe should, in fact, be aware of the fact that there is  a\r\n\r\nrapidly  changing environment around us.  Our  neighbours\r\n\r\nare  also  contemplating the same thing as  us.   We  are\r\n\r\nworking with a moving target.  We want to lower the  cost\r\n\r\nof  doing business, so do our neighbours.  We want to  be\r\n\r\nthe  Life  Sciences Hub in Singapore, so do  cities  like\r\n\r\nXian, Hyderabad, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot over-emphasise the need for speed. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  is not only the ideas which will define  our\r\n\r\nsuccess,  but more importantly, our ability to  implement\r\n\r\nthese  ideas  and our ability to implement  them  swiftly\r\n\r\nwhich  will  determine  how  successful  we  will  be  in\r\n\r\ntransforming our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomy.  So let us not get too complacent but get moving\r\n\r\nfaster than what we are doing right now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of a non-starter and a failed attempt\r\n\r\nwhich  comes  to  mind is the NatSteel  divestment  saga,\r\n\r\nwhich  dragged on for so long.  The inability to  make  a\r\n\r\njudgement to take a certain amount of loss, has  resulted\r\n\r\nin  the  sloppy execution, in my opinion, of the NatSteel\r\n\r\ndivestment.  It is clear that Temasek failed  to  realise\r\n\r\nthis  to  be  a  short term loss but a  long  term  gain.\r\n\r\nBecause  it has to answer to the people of Singapore,  it\r\n\r\ntherefore has to err on the safe side by taking  a  kiasu\r\n\r\napproach in ensuring the best possible value because they\r\n\r\nhave  to  answer to all of us.  Therefore,  this  is  the\r\n\r\ncause  of Government getting involved in business in  the\r\n\r\nfirst   place.   In  the  process,  we  lost  a   greater\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  setting an excellent example  of  a  GLC\r\n\r\ndivestment  done successfully for the long-term  good  of\r\n\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to see an implementation\r\n\r\nroadmap  and  an implementation committee, like  what  Mr\r\n\r\nLeong suggested, with the responsibility of ensuring that\r\n\r\nrecommendations are implemented the way we intended  them\r\n\r\nto  be,  and  with  the speed necessary  to  achieve  the\r\n\r\nintended impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be good for this implementation committee to\r\n\r\nshare its results regularly by publishing a scorecard for\r\n\r\nall of us to see.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final topic I would like to touch upon is\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  Having been so used  to  developing  a\r\n\r\ncorporate-based  economy in the last 30 years,  the  real\r\n\r\nquestion  we have to ask is: are we willing  and  are  we\r\n\r\nready  to  make  the transformation to an entrepreneurial\r\n\r\neconomy?  And I think this is the most difficult question\r\n\r\nfor us to answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two key elements for us to succeed.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  understanding  what  it  takes  to  create   an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial economy and, secondly, the lessons learnt\r\n\r\nfrom our successes with the multi-national companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, understanding what it takes to create\r\n\r\nan   entrepreneurial  economy.   This  is   the   biggest\r\n\r\nchallenge and the most difficult one to overcome.  Unless\r\n\r\nand until we resolve this issue, we will never be able to\r\n\r\ntransform our economy.  The challenge, therefore, for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the Minister for Entrepreneurship  is  to\r\n\r\nmake a sincere pledge to lead this transformation of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  and, then, to understand what is needed to  make\r\n\r\nthis transformation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first challenge, therefore, is that of a mindset\r\n\r\nchange.    Yes,  it  is  difficult  to  attract   foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies to invest and set up shop in Singapore, but  it\r\n\r\nis  even  more  difficult for our  economic  agencies  to\r\n\r\nvisualise how a start-up or a non-entity - someone who is\r\n\r\ntrying to do a start-up - can one day evolve into a world-class  company based in Singapore.  So, it  is  therefore\r\n\r\ncompelling to still take the relatively easy way  out  of\r\n\r\ncontinuing to deal with a corporate-based economy  -  the\r\n\r\ntried and tested model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfortunate fact is that I feel the Government\r\n\r\nis still unsure or half-hearted about putting in place an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  economy.  Why is this  so?   If  we  ask\r\n\r\nanyone  of the Government economic agencies or the  civil\r\n\r\nservants who are driving this initiative, we cannot  help\r\n\r\nbut  conclude that they are still programmed to bring  in\r\n\r\nforeign  MNCs.  The sad thing is that many are  sceptical\r\n\r\nabout  the ability of our local entrepreneurs to make  it\r\n\r\nbig.  I say this from my own personal experience and from\r\n\r\ndirect feedback from would-be entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue on entrepreneurship is lessons\r\n\r\nlearnt  from  our successes with MNCs.   If  the  mindset\r\n\r\nchange  can  be achieved, then I feel that the  next  few\r\n\r\nsteps  needed to succeed in transforming our economy  and\r\n\r\nof  encouraging more entrepreneurs to set up their  bases\r\n\r\nin Singapore would be much easier.  We can learn from our\r\n\r\nsuccesses in the economic development of Singapore in the\r\n\r\nfirst  30  years,  which have been in attracting  foreign\r\n\r\ndirect  investments,  multinational  companies,  and   in\r\n\r\nestablishing bigger companies, ie, the Government-linked\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies  here.  We can then apply them as we  focus  on\r\n\r\nbuilding an entrepreneurial economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three main lessons to be learned from\r\n\r\nbuilding  a corporate economy.  They are, first, creating\r\n\r\na   conducive  environment;  second,  putting  in   place\r\n\r\nincentive  schemes;  and last, but  not  least,  a  hand-holding of multinational companies from cradle to  grave.\r\n\r\nWhat  I am about to say may seem obvious, but I feel that\r\n\r\nwe have not fully understood the root causes and have not\r\n\r\naddressed  and learnt from these lessons, and to  address\r\n\r\nthe   issues  on  how  we  can  successfully  create  our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, on creating a conducive environment\r\n\r\nfor MNCs to set up base, why were we successful?  Because\r\n\r\nthe    Government    had   developed    an    appropriate\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,   offered  cheap  land,   removed   other\r\n\r\nobstacles that may have existed and made it easy for MNCs\r\n\r\nto  decide  to  start  up  operations  here.   Rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  were  tailor-made for MNCs  and  for  bigger\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Many of the MNCs and GLCs had direct  access\r\n\r\nto  top  civil  servants and Ministers, and this  allowed\r\n\r\nthem  to resolve issues faster.  The lesson here is  that\r\n\r\nthe  rules  made for bigger companies will not  work  for\r\n\r\nstart-ups and for smaller companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on incentives and financing schemes made\r\n\r\nfor bigger companies.  To complement the setting up of  a\r\n\r\nconducive environment, the economic development  agencies\r\n\r\ndeveloped a slew of incentive schemes, Government  grants\r\n\r\nand tax breaks, again tailor-made for MNCs and for bigger\r\n\r\ncompanies.  The lesson here is that while it is easy  for\r\n\r\nbig companies to apply and utilise the incentive schemes,\r\n\r\nthe  smaller companies find it terribly difficult  to  do\r\n\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, hand-holding of MNCs from cradle to grave.\r\n\r\nThis,  in  my opinion, is the most significant initiative\r\n\r\nimplemented  here  that  made MNCs  most  comfortable  in\r\n\r\nsetting  up  bases in Singapore.  Kudos to  the  EDB  for\r\n\r\nthis.  We created a one-stop\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagency which hand-held MNCs coming into Singapore,  right\r\n\r\nfrom  the  time that we were courting, through  the  time\r\n\r\nthat they started operations in Singapore, up to the time\r\n\r\nthat  we  encouraged them to leave for places like  Batam\r\n\r\nand Suzhou.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dealt with EDB on many occasions - while\r\n\r\nworking  in a multi-national company as well  as  when  I\r\n\r\nwent to start up my own local companies - I thought I had\r\n\r\na  good feel of how they operate.  I must confess that  I\r\n\r\nreally  understood  EDB  only  after  reading  its   book\r\n\r\npublished  recently called Heartwork.  It is an excellent\r\n\r\nbook.  After reading it, I understood why EDB did what it\r\n\r\ndid,  and became even more convinced that EDB will  never\r\n\r\nbe able to handle and help local start-ups.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  say that the EDB has done an excellent job all  these\r\n\r\nyears but, having understood the charter and the mode  of\r\n\r\noperation, especially after reading the book, I  realised\r\n\r\nthat  it is unfair and impossible for them to effectively\r\n\r\nsupport  local companies.  Let me share one example  from\r\n\r\nthe book to illustrate the mindset with which it operated\r\n\r\nin helping bigger companies coming into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the book, what I read was, when Apple\r\n\r\ncomputers  wanted to set up a factory in  Singapore  many\r\n\r\nyears  ago, EDB went the full mile, did all the work  for\r\n\r\nApple in fitting up the whole factory.  In fact, it  went\r\n\r\neven  further than that.  An officer was allocated  on  a\r\n\r\nfull-time basis to become the project manager for setting\r\n\r\nup   of  the  factory.   The  American  manager  who  was\r\n\r\nresponsible for setting up the Apple factory in Singapore\r\n\r\ndid not have to be personally here in Singapore while the\r\n\r\nfacilities  were  being set up.   That  is  what  I  call\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone in this House give me an example of a\r\n\r\nsimilar  service for our local companies?  I do not  know\r\n\r\nof  any.   The  reality is that most local companies  are\r\n\r\nleft on their own to fight their own battles and to clear\r\n\r\nthe many obstacles themselves.  At times, I dare say that\r\n\r\nthe  bureaucracy works against them.  The lesson here  is\r\n\r\nthat had we not had EDB to champion the cause of MNCs, we\r\n\r\nmay not have developed such a vibrant economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChampion agencies can do wonders because of the influence\r\n\r\nthey  have in clearing these obstacles.  So, how  can  we\r\n\r\napply these lessons?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let us create a conducive environment by\r\n\r\nmaking  a  review  of rules - which is happening,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  rules  should not just be reviewed  but  also\r\n\r\nrevamped  - this time round, by putting smaller companies\r\n\r\nand start-ups centre-stage when we develop these rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, of course, is to revisit all the incentive\r\n\r\nschemes and tailor them to suit start-ups and SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we really need an EDB-style organisation, a\r\n\r\none-stop  agency for SMEs and start-ups.  Today,  we  see\r\n\r\ntoo  many  agencies  claiming to champion  the  SMEs  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, but my experience with them is  such  that\r\n\r\nnone  is  able to provide the comprehensive service  that\r\n\r\nEDB  does for MNCs.  Many things, in fact, fall into  the\r\n\r\ncrack for entrepreneurs and smaller companies.  We need a\r\n\r\nchampion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to build a vibrant financing environment,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the ones that exist in entrepreneurial economies\r\n\r\nin the USA, Taiwan and Israel.  I will elaborate on these\r\n\r\nduring the Committee of Supply debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the budget is just one of the\r\n\r\nmany levers to address the current situation that we  are\r\n\r\nin.   The  current crisis is different from the  previous\r\n\r\npredicaments, although we may use the same terminology to\r\n\r\ndescribe  them.  We have been using the same old  formula\r\n\r\nto  address these new predicaments.  The context  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem  has  changed.  And it will continue  to  change,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  live in a world where change is a  constant.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, each crisis will become more complex  than\r\n\r\nthe  previous one.  We have to adopt newer measures,  and\r\n\r\nthe  speed  of  implementation  is  essential  for  their\r\n\r\nsuccess.  This year's budget is being hailed as a  budget\r\n\r\nin  transition.  My opinion is that we need to get out of\r\n\r\nthis  transition quickly.  We have been in the transition\r\n\r\nmode  for  quite  some time.  We need  to  arrive  at  an\r\n\r\neconomic  model that we want very quickly.  We have  been\r\n\r\nplanning for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite some time.  The planning phase is over.  It is  now\r\n\r\ntime  to execute and implement bold measures.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  half-hearted in our endeavours.  We need to be  clear\r\n\r\nin thought and be decisive in action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the belief that the Minister will implement\r\n\r\nswiftly these new measures, I support this motion.\r\n\r\n<br>11.52 am\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister and Finance Minister announced  my\r\n\r\nappointment   as   Minister  of  State   in   charge   of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, I have been inundated with emails  from\r\n\r\nthe  public.   There have been many suggestions  on  what\r\n\r\nneeds to be done to further the cause of entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  I will take these and those that are being\r\n\r\nraised  in  this House in the course of this debate  into\r\n\r\nserious  consideration.  Some of these I will  answer  in\r\n\r\nthe  Committee of Supply, and others I may  need  to  get\r\n\r\nback  to Members later, as it may require further thought\r\n\r\non my part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whatever it is, I see this sudden deluge of\r\n\r\nadvice  as a big positive, as it means that there  is  an\r\n\r\nincreasing  constituency in our  society  to  embrace  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial, go-getting culture, where  opportunities\r\n\r\nare  seized and risks taken to create something different\r\n\r\nin  whatever  we do.  In fact, some email writers,  after\r\n\r\nsending me one advice after another, told me that, for  a\r\n\r\nsuitable  fee, this arrangement could be made  permanent!\r\n\r\nSo, I think that there are good grounds for hope that  we\r\n\r\nwill   indeed   successfully  foster  an  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us be clear right from the outset that we\r\n\r\nare  not here trying to manufacture entrepreneurs - that,\r\n\r\nI  think,  is  not possible - but rather  to  create  the\r\n\r\nenabling conditions for entrepreneurs to emerge and grow.\r\n\r\nThis is an important role for the Government to play, and\r\n\r\nthis  is not, as some had suggested, unique to Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  so-called \"nanny state\", but undertaken actively  by\r\n\r\nmany  others,  including the United States,  Ireland  and\r\n\r\nTaiwan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Silicon Valley types might be dismissive of any\r\n\r\nrole for the Government, but the fact is that one of  the\r\n\r\nkey  reasons for the Valley's success has been  the  huge\r\n\r\nfederal defence spendings in the high-tech sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, as customer, as against being a\r\n\r\ndirect player in the market, is one of the most important\r\n\r\nroles that it can play to promote entrepreneurship.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment should outsource its requirements whenever the\r\n\r\nmarket  can  provide them, rather than produce  them  in-house.   By  doing  so, it creates new opportunities  for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  and  space for innovation.   This  is  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of the ERC Yellow Pages rule, which the Government\r\n\r\nhas accepted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the most far-reaching of the ERC\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  as  it  envisions  a  world  where  the\r\n\r\nboundary  between  the  State and the  market  shifts  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of the market.  Its criticality lies in the  fact\r\n\r\nthat,  by  giving institutional expression to  a  market-driven  public policy stance, it will change the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  bureaucrats interact with private players  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic  sphere.  Consequently, just as  the  Government\r\n\r\nwants  Singaporeans to be risk-takers, it should  set  an\r\n\r\nexample  by  being  willing not  just  to  oursource  its\r\n\r\nrequirements,   but  to  take  a  chance   by   accepting\r\n\r\ninnovative solutions from private firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the Government on the operating\r\n\r\nculture  cannot  be over-emphasised, as its  interactions\r\n\r\nwith  Singaporeans affect the way in which people behave.\r\n\r\nThis  was why I had argued that to shift mindsets,  which\r\n\r\nis our paramount challenge, the Government should set its\r\n\r\ndefault  key  at \"Yes\" rather than \"No\" in  its  dealings\r\n\r\nwith business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want Singaporeans to reach for a new frontier,\r\n\r\nto  establish leadership in unknown future markets,  then\r\n\r\nregulating them by what is known is not the way to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also means that the Government would need to\r\n\r\ngradually scale back its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrole  in the lives of Singaporeans to allow greater  room\r\n\r\nfor  entrepreneurship to develop.  I say  \"gradually\"  as\r\n\r\nthis   has  to  be  well-calibrated,  so  that  even   as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  greater  freedom,  the  corresponding\r\n\r\ngreater responsibility that comes with it is done without\r\n\r\nupsetting the social cohesion that is underpinned by  the\r\n\r\nsafety nets in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to make this cultural shift to a more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial society, our education system  is  vital.\r\n\r\nIn this, things are underway, and our schools are seeking\r\n\r\nto  create a more open, innovative and creative  learning\r\n\r\nculture.  Some schools have also introduced programmes to\r\n\r\nexpose  their  students  to the  world  of  business  and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.     The    ERC     sub-committee     on\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship and Internationalisation (EISC)  that  I\r\n\r\nchair had suggested that we take it further by making  it\r\n\r\ncompulsory  that every child be asked to  do  a  business\r\n\r\nproject, in the same way that they do science projects in\r\n\r\nschools.  The aim here is not, as some critics have said,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government is trying to fix  this  problem  by\r\n\r\nteaching \"entrepreneurship\", much in the same way that if\r\n\r\nwe need more engineers, we simply produce more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, it is to imbue in our young a different\r\n\r\nworldview.  It is not a world where everything must  have\r\n\r\nits  place and nothing left to chance.  In such a  world,\r\n\r\nthere can be little out-of-the-box thinking.  Nor is it a\r\n\r\nworld  where we wipe off every speck of dust and, in  the\r\n\r\nprocess, we may well be getting rid of stardust as  well.\r\n\r\nRather,  we  want our young to grow up in a  world  where\r\n\r\nthey  are  comfortable  with diversity  and  where  their\r\n\r\nopportunities  are  limited not by the prevailing  wisdom\r\n\r\nand  strictures  of the day, but by the extent  of  their\r\n\r\nimagination.  Whether they become entrepreneurs  or  not,\r\n\r\nwill  depend on their own choices, but we would have done\r\n\r\nour part by widening their career horizons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides culture, cutting red-tape, and better access\r\n\r\nto  finance  are  also important enabling conditions  for\r\n\r\nenterprise development.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  aggressively cut red-tape.  It may  be  one\r\n\r\nlicence requirement for one agency but, when we add\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  all up, we may have death by a thousand cuts.  This\r\n\r\nwas why the EISC had suggested that rules and regulations\r\n\r\nbe  date-stamped.  Having sunset clauses will ensure that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a mandatory periodic review of regulations  to\r\n\r\nensure  their relevance.  We are glad that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  accepted  the  spirit  of  this  recommendation   by\r\n\r\nmandating   a  thorough  house-cleaning  of   rules   and\r\n\r\nregulations of all Ministries every five years.   In  the\r\n\r\nmeantime, if there are any rules and regulations that are\r\n\r\nstifling  businesses, entrepreneurs can and should  bring\r\n\r\nthis up to the Pro-Enterprise Panel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to capital is another area, which is often\r\n\r\ncited  by  entrepreneurs as key not just  to  starting  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  but for it to grow.  We want as many  modes  as\r\n\r\npossible,   so   that  there  is   a   market   for   the\r\n\r\ncommercialisation of ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here the entrepreneurs also tell me that we\r\n\r\nshould not throw money at the problem.  I have had  quite\r\n\r\na   number   of  suggestions  that  recommend  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment give money freely to Singaporeans who want  to\r\n\r\nstart  a  business.  It is like having an ATM machine  in\r\n\r\nwhich when you key in the word \"entrepreneurs\", out comes\r\n\r\na stash of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These successful businessmen tell me that we should\r\n\r\nnot  do  the work for entrepreneurs.  Yes, a spectrum  of\r\n\r\nrisk capital is vital for entrepreneurship and we want to\r\n\r\npromote and develop that to support them.  However,  they\r\n\r\nstressed  that people must work for this.   Because  only\r\n\r\nwhen  people  work for it, is it clear that  they  really\r\n\r\nbelieve in it, and that they are really committed to make\r\n\r\nit  successful.   That, which is given  free,  is  seldom\r\n\r\nvalued in life. This is why I think it is important  that\r\n\r\nfor  most  of  our  Government  financing  schemes  that,\r\n\r\nwhenever  possible, there should be some form  of  market\r\n\r\nvalidation  before funds are disbursed as the bureaucrats\r\n\r\nrunning  them  are often in no position to  evaluate  the\r\n\r\nviability of the business propositions.  The people,  who\r\n\r\ncriticised  this view, often tell me in the  same  breath\r\n\r\nthat  bureaucrats  have no idea about business  and  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  the  best people when it comes to  giving  out\r\n\r\nmoney to business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point worth emphasising here is that the role of\r\n\r\nGovernment in promoting entrepreneurship is not to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  entrepreneurs  are successful  but  to  create  the\r\n\r\nconditions that enable them to be successful.  This is  a\r\n\r\ncrucial difference that must be borne in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this then is the roadmap towards a\r\n\r\nmore  entrepreneurial society. We will know when we  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded  when  Singaporeans increasingly  look  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket  rather  than  the  Government  in  making   their\r\n\r\ndecisions.   However, there are no silver  bullets  here.\r\n\r\nThis  may  discomfit some Singaporeans who  are  used  to\r\n\r\n\"instant  trees\".  In fact, critics of the ERC have  been\r\n\r\ndisappointed  that  there have  been  no  dramatic  magic\r\n\r\nformula  unveiled in its Report to ease the anxieties  in\r\n\r\nthe economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, there is much in the Report that gives us hope\r\n\r\nfor  a  better future.  At its core is a transformational\r\n\r\nvision  of the economy - of a people intimately connected\r\n\r\nto  a  wider world, infused with the spirit of enterprise\r\n\r\nand   where   abilities  and  talents   are   recognised,\r\n\r\ncelebrated  and  rewarded. These,  in  essence,  are  our\r\n\r\nambitions for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not how well we plan that will\r\n\r\ndetermine whether we reach this destination.  But how  we\r\n\r\nadapt and adjust as circumstances change that will decide\r\n\r\nour  future.  And in this, one of our greatest  strengths\r\n\r\nas  a  Government  and  a people has  been  that  we  are\r\n\r\nperpetual  worriers,  never complacent.   This  manifests\r\n\r\nitself  in a willingness to anticipate and face  problems\r\n\r\nsquarely, take difficult decisions and a pervading  sense\r\n\r\nof  urgency  that  there  is no  permanent  advantage  in\r\n\r\nwhatever  we  do in a rapidly changing environment.   The\r\n\r\nyear-long  ERC  process is a testament  to  this  and  it\r\n\r\nunderlines  that we are not wedded to our past  successes\r\n\r\nand  are  open to views and fresh ideas from outside  the\r\n\r\npublic sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a public relations exercise but a serious\r\n\r\nattempt  at remaking the Singapore economy.  In the  EISC\r\n\r\nthat   Mr  Inderjit  Singh  sat  on,  many  of  the   key\r\n\r\nrecommendations, such as the Yellow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPages  rule and mandatory periodic review of rules,  have\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted and implemented.  In fact, in the area  of\r\n\r\ngreater  access  to  finance for  SMEs,  MTI  is  looking\r\n\r\ntowards  how best to implement the recommendations  of  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  chaired  by Mr Singh.  We thank  him  for  his\r\n\r\ninitiative.   It  also  underscores  the  seriousness  of\r\n\r\npurpose on the Government's part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence is key to our continued economic growth.\r\n\r\nMembers  may want to bear that in mind.  Because  of  the\r\n\r\ntrust reposed on them as Members of this House, what they\r\n\r\nsay   will   have   a  bearing  on  the   confidence   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    May  I  suggest  that  this   trust   be\r\n\r\ndischarged, in what Mr Yeo Guat Kwang said in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  today, by the exercise of leadership to give  hope\r\n\r\nrather  than  to accentuate the anxieties of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nat this difficult time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I read a very bearish view on Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhen the analyst was asked whether there was any area  of\r\n\r\nstrength  that he could see Singapore developing  to  get\r\n\r\nout  of what he saw as a secular decline, he replied,  \"I\r\n\r\ncannot think of any.\"  He had just been to China and  was\r\n\r\nspooked by this vast and rapidly, emerging economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if this is so, we might as well\r\n\r\nfold  up  the  tent and give up.  But this  is  nonsense.\r\n\r\nYes, China poses serious challenges to not just Singapore\r\n\r\nbut  the  region.   But  as any  first  year  student  of\r\n\r\ninternational trade will tell you, even if China  has  an\r\n\r\nabsolute advantage in everything, it will still buy  from\r\n\r\nSingapore, as what matters is the comparative rather than\r\n\r\nabsolute advantage of the two countries in the goods  and\r\n\r\nservices  that they produce.  In other words,  there  are\r\n\r\nopportunities.   It is what we make  of  them.   That  he\r\n\r\ncannot see any future for Singapore is not that there  is\r\n\r\nnone, but a failure of his imagination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we should not feel handicapped by our lack of\r\n\r\nland  mass  and natural resources.  Countries like  Japan\r\n\r\nand the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNordic states have turned their national constraints into\r\n\r\nenduring  strengths.  To illustrate, the lack  of  living\r\n\r\nand  working  space has driven Japan to the  frontier  of\r\n\r\ntechnology in miniaturisation.  Similarly, the  difficult\r\n\r\nterrain  in  the  Nordic countries has  spurred  them  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  great  strengths  in  communications  and  power\r\n\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a knowledge-based economy, it is sometimes not\r\n\r\nnature's endowment, but nature's deprivation that  drives\r\n\r\nan economy's competencies and comparative advantages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore, we have never accepted that size is\r\n\r\ndestiny.  We  are  one  of  the world's  leading  trading\r\n\r\nnations despite having a very small population. We are  a\r\n\r\nmajor petrochemical hub despite having no oil of our own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economist magazine has long credited us with\r\n\r\ninventing   the   MNC   export-led  model   of   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  This allowed us a headstart in accelerating\r\n\r\nour  industrialisation and linked us  rapidly  to  first-world   technologies,  expertise   and   markets.    Many\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries had earlier rejected this  strategy\r\n\r\nas   a  new  form  of  colonialism  but  they  had  since\r\n\r\nassiduously followed us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are always many reasons why we\r\n\r\nthink we cannot do certain things because we do not  have\r\n\r\nthe  size.   But  that  by itself  may  be  the  spur  to\r\n\r\ncreativity,  to  force  us to think  beyond  our  current\r\n\r\ncircumstances and leverage our advantages in a  different\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was and I believe still is the spirit that\r\n\r\ncharacterises us as a people.  We have it in us not  just\r\n\r\nto  ride  the current difficulties but to build a  better\r\n\r\nfuture for our children and ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As William Jennings Bryan put it, \"Destiny is not a\r\n\r\nmatter of chance.  It is a matter of choice.  It is not a\r\n\r\nthing  to  be  waited  for, for  it  is  a  thing  to  be\r\n\r\nachieved.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, before I go\r\n\r\non  to my speech, can I just ask the Minister of State to\r\n\r\nclarify  certain things?

Some economists are saying that the\r\n\r\nunemployment situation may even get worse by the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe  year,  to  4.8%  or even 5%, about  100,000  of  our\r\n\r\nworkforce would be out of job by the year-end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bad employment situation is evident at my weekly\r\n\r\nmeet-the-people  session.  In the past, when  times  were\r\n\r\nbad  in  1985, 1991, 1997 and 1998, there were  talks  of\r\n\r\nunemployment  but at that point of time, I  did  not  get\r\n\r\nresidents coming to see me at the meet-the-people session\r\n\r\nto  ask  for jobs.  But these days are different.  Almost\r\n\r\nevery  week, there is at least one resident who comes  to\r\n\r\nsee me to fix for him/her a job.  The worst is that these\r\n\r\ndays,  residents  who ask for jobs are  not  just  manual\r\n\r\nworkers.  University graduates are also looking for jobs.\r\n\r\nOnly last week, a lady in her mid-40s, a Business Studies\r\n\r\ngraduate  from England came to ask for a job.   It  looks\r\n\r\nlike the Government must make creation of jobs one of its\r\n\r\nurgent  priorities.  Yet, this year's  Budget  is  not  a\r\n\r\nstimulating  one.  There are no indications to  push  the\r\n\r\neconomy forward.  The Budget does not address or to  spur\r\n\r\nconsumer and business spending and expand the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, we see that the Government is\r\n\r\nrather complacent when MAERSK Sealand Shipping Line moved\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits  operations  to  the  neighbouring  port  of  Tanjung\r\n\r\nPelapas.   The  PSA did not seem to see  our  neigbouring\r\n\r\nport  as a dangerous threat but, obviously, it does  now.\r\n\r\nThe  PSA  Corporation has trimmed its  workforce.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  800 port workers were retrenched.  We also  hear\r\n\r\nof massive retrenchments at the HDB and also at Chartered\r\n\r\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Limited, which is the world's\r\n\r\nthird   largest  chip  foundry.  Chartered  Semiconductor\r\n\r\nManufacturing  Limited  is  a  listed  company  of  which\r\n\r\nGovernment-owned Singapore Technologies holds 60.5%.  The\r\n\r\nretrenchment  of about 500 jobs, or 14% of its  worldwide\r\n\r\nworkforce,   at   Chartered  Semiconductor  Manufacturing\r\n\r\nLimited is due to the closure of an old wafer plant  this\r\n\r\nmonth.  These rates of retrenchments perhaps mark the end\r\n\r\nof  the  iron ricebowl in the PSA Corporation  and  other\r\n\r\nGovernment-related   companies.   Business   people   are\r\n\r\ncalling   this   phenomenon  \"the   Singapore   squeeze\",\r\n\r\nresulting  in  job  losses  and  affecting  the  island's\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must understand that our job losses at\r\n\r\nhome  is  due  to the harsh business environment  in  the\r\n\r\nneigbouring   countries,  the  region   and   in   China.\r\n\r\nSingapore's businesses are being squeezed by competition,\r\n\r\nespecially  from  China.  Singapore  must  find  its  new\r\n\r\nniches in business and the bio-technology industries that\r\n\r\nare  now  being  encouraged and developed  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is going to take time to develop.  Meanwhile,\r\n\r\nSingapore  must  lower the cost of doing  business  here.\r\n\r\nBusinessmen are disappointed that the personal income tax\r\n\r\nand  corporate  tax rates are not cut  by  at  least  1%.\r\n\r\nLower  corporate tax rate and lower personal  income  tax\r\n\r\nrates  would have encouraged MNCs and foreign talents  to\r\n\r\nremain in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also appear that the middle income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are not benefiting from this  Budget.   The\r\n\r\nReport of the Economic Review Committee does not seem  to\r\n\r\nhighlight  much on promotion of education and healthcare.\r\n\r\nThe  people  of Singapore have attained a high  level  of\r\n\r\neducation and Singapore should exploit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits   know-how  in  education  and  make  Singapore   the\r\n\r\neducation  hub of the region.  The Government  must  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  people who are engaged in the  education\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore have the highest quality of honesty\r\n\r\nand  integrity  and  not be allowed  to  exploit  foreign\r\n\r\nstudents.   Instead  of giving good value  in  education,\r\n\r\nsome  of  our  private schools are, in  fact,  misleading\r\n\r\nforeign students.  A Chinese student came to see me as  a\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament.  She complained  that  a  private\r\n\r\nschool in Singapore has cheated her of $3,600.  She  paid\r\n\r\nthat  sum  of  money  so that she can pursue  an  English\r\n\r\ncourse,  but  the  private school made her  sign  a  hire\r\n\r\npurchase agreement to buy only a few textbooks and a  few\r\n\r\nbrochures.   The hire purchase agreement did not  include\r\n\r\nthe English lessons she was entitled to.  In the end, the\r\n\r\nforeign  Chinese  student  failed  to  study  English  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   If Singapore is to build a good name  as  an\r\n\r\neducation  centre,  then the Ministry of  Education  must\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that  private schools here in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nproperly  regulated and supervised and they do  not  give\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  bad  name  in the region  as  an  education\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, most of our best and brightest\r\n\r\nstudents  chose to study medicine.  Therefore,  our  best\r\n\r\nbrains  go  to  take up medicine.  Accordingly,  I  would\r\n\r\nimagine  we  must  produce  the  best  doctors  and  best\r\n\r\nsurgeons that we can possibly produce.  Singapore  should\r\n\r\nexploit  this  great  talent pool of  healthcare  givers.\r\n\r\nSingapore should have, by virtue of having such  a  great\r\n\r\npool of medical talent, become the medical centre of this\r\n\r\nregion.   But I hear that because of our high cost,  even\r\n\r\nmuch  of  our  medical business is being  taken  away  by\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   As  regards medical cost,  I  hear  that  the\r\n\r\nmedical cost in Singapore is exorbitant compared to those\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia.   I have heard of a story of two  brothers,\r\n\r\nboth  suffering from heart diseases.  One had  his  heart\r\n\r\nproblem  treated  in Singapore and the Singapore  surgeon\r\n\r\ncharged  him S$40,000.  The other brother had less  money\r\n\r\nand  found  his  way to Malaysia and had a similar  heart\r\n\r\nproblem  treated  in  Kuala Lumpur.   He  paid  only  the\r\n\r\nequivalent of S$500 in Malaysia.  Both patients\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecovered  from  their heart operations and  subsequently\r\n\r\nboth  had normal lives.  The question one naturally  asks\r\n\r\nis:  how  can  a similar operation be carried  out  at  a\r\n\r\nfraction  of  the  cost in Malaysia?   The  treatment  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia was as good as that of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cite another instance where I have personal\r\n\r\nknowledge.   I know of a private hospital in Johor  Bahru\r\n\r\nwhich charges only RM280 or about S$131 for treatment  of\r\n\r\none-time  kidney dialysis.  The Johor Bahru  hospital  is\r\n\r\npurely  run  on a commercial basis and is not subsidised.\r\n\r\nOn  the part of Singapore, the National Kidney Foundation\r\n\r\n(NKF)  clinics here are subsidised and charge one  kidney\r\n\r\ndialysis treatment at about S$400, about 3 times that  is\r\n\r\ncharged  in the Johor Bahru private hospital.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhy  there  should be such a great disparity  in  medical\r\n\r\ncost between Singapore and Malaysia.  There is definitely\r\n\r\na   big  difference  in  cost  of  medical  treatment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and in Malaysia.  The medical cost in  Malaysia\r\n\r\nis very much lower than those in Singapore.  I would like\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government to investigate  why  Singapore\r\n\r\ndoctors are charging so much more for their services than\r\n\r\nthose  of  their counterparts in Malaysia.  Could  it  be\r\n\r\nthat  our Singapore doctors are paying very high rentals?\r\n\r\nIf  that  is so, then I would recommend that the HDB  and\r\n\r\nthe Government work out special schemes whereby Singapore\r\n\r\nmedical practitioners can benefit lower rentals and those\r\n\r\nsavings can be passed to their patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area I would like to mention is the\r\n\r\ncreative  industry.  Under this particular  section,  the\r\n\r\nreport   of  the  ERC  gives  only  7  short  paragraphs.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the entertainment and film industries  are  big\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in other countries, in the case of Singapore,\r\n\r\nit  is particularly weak in this respect.  We do not have\r\n\r\nany  film  industry of any sort to speak of.   Yet  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  particularly America, are  making  very  good\r\n\r\nmoney  out  of  the film industry.  On Singapore's  part,\r\n\r\nsince we do not have such an industry, we have to buy all\r\n\r\nour  films  from  abroad,  thus  losing  massive  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange dollars in buying films to fill our television\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logically, Singapore should be building a creative\r\n\r\nindustry.  Singapore has no natural resources, except its\r\n\r\npeople,  and  for creative industry, all  they  need  are\r\n\r\npeople  who are entrepreneurial and creative.   It  looks\r\n\r\nlike Singaporeans have to learn to be entrepreneurial and\r\n\r\ncreative  so that hopefully we can build a film  industry\r\n\r\nof  our own.  A film industry is important for Singapore,\r\n\r\nnot  because it would make money for Singapore but,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  it  can  build  for  Singapore  a  cultural\r\n\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\n<br>12.20 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Perhaps I can\r\n\r\nstart off where Mr Chiam left off.  I agree entirely with\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam that we can certainly do with a few more of the\r\n\r\ncreative industries.  But he highlighted two things  with\r\n\r\nwhich  I thought perhaps are not entirely accurate.   The\r\n\r\nsuggestion appears to be that the Government has not made\r\n\r\njob  creation one of its priorities.  When I last  looked\r\n\r\nat  the  budget,  there  was a  $500  million  retraining\r\n\r\nprogramme  in  there.   If that is  not  a  priority  for\r\n\r\ncreating  jobs,  I  do  not know  what  is.   There  were\r\n\r\nmeasures to attract foreign investments, there were  also\r\n\r\nmeasures not to tax foreign income.  All of that is aimed\r\n\r\nat  creating jobs.  So I do not think it is entirely fair\r\n\r\nto say that job creation is not a priority.  I think that\r\n\r\nit is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second statement that was made was that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not  seem  to  promote  education   and\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   As  I  remember it,  we  spent  three  days\r\n\r\ndebating on a White Paper on Education, three days' worth\r\n\r\nof  very serious consideration on the quality and content\r\n\r\nof  education in Singapore, and I think that it cannot be\r\n\r\ndisputed  that our Government does concentrate a  lot  on\r\n\r\neducation.   The  example cited was of a Chinese  student\r\n\r\nwho  had  received  rather poor treatment  in  a  private\r\n\r\ninstitution.  But the Government does not run the private\r\n\r\ninstitution.  That is something that has to be  taken  up\r\n\r\nat  the  level  of  the educational institution  that  is\r\n\r\nproviding  the service.  The Government cannot  do  every\r\n\r\nsingle  thing,  and that really brings  me  to  the  main\r\n\r\nthrust of my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomments  on  the Budget, which is that it is  all  about\r\n\r\ntaking responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of comments have been floated up that this\r\n\r\nBudget does not go far enough, it does not do enough  for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, it does not do enough for  SMEs,  it  does\r\n\r\nnot  do enough for this group of people or that group  of\r\n\r\npeople.  My response is that this Budget is what we  make\r\n\r\nof  it.  It will succeed or it will fail depending on the\r\n\r\namount of effort that each one of us personally puts into\r\n\r\nit.   Unlike our neighbours who surround us,  we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  huge amounts of natural resources, we do  not  have\r\n\r\nhuge  tracts of land, we do not have minerals, we do  not\r\n\r\nhave  agriculture.  The one thing we have is our  people.\r\n\r\nPeople  make all the difference in these times,  and  the\r\n\r\ncritical factor is attitude, and the mental attitude that\r\n\r\nwe have to have is taking responsibility and ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans do this. Many of them go about in\r\n\r\nlife taking responsibilities for themselves and for their\r\n\r\nwork  and business.  But increasingly, over the years,  I\r\n\r\nhave  noticed a trend that seems to have crept  into  our\r\n\r\nnational psyche and consciousness, which is this trend of\r\n\r\nwanting to place responsibility elsewhere.  An example is\r\n\r\nthe  recent MRT accident.  After the accident where there\r\n\r\nwas a car on the MRT line, and the train had crashed into\r\n\r\nit,  I  noticed a couple of letters in the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nsaying:  Why has the LTA not built stronger fences?   Why\r\n\r\nhave  they  not  done  something  to  prevent  this  from\r\n\r\nhappening?   And  my response is:  Is that  not  a  wrong\r\n\r\nquestion?  The right question must surely be:  what is  a\r\n\r\n23-year old driver of a Mercedes Benz doing in the middle\r\n\r\nof  a MRT track?  Surely that must be the right question.\r\n\r\nWhat  on earth was he doing?  How was he driving to  land\r\n\r\nup  there?   Surely  that is the  area  that  one  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on, rather than saying that:   you  must  be\r\n\r\nprotected against something like this.  It is a  question\r\n\r\nof  responsibility.  This idea of looking  elsewhere  for\r\n\r\nprotection against something that is going to  happen  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  good  one.   You cannot buffer  people  from  the\r\n\r\nvicissitudes of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife is tough.  That is one of the things that we have to\r\n\r\ndeal  with,  and Government cannot protect everybody  all\r\n\r\nthe  time, from every possible adversity that might  come\r\n\r\nup.   It is very much a question of what each of us makes\r\n\r\nof the circumstances that we find ourselves in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was very young, my mum took me to\r\n\r\nsee a movie called \"Born Free\".  Some of you may remember\r\n\r\nit.   This naturalist had adopted this lioness cub, Elsa,\r\n\r\nand  they raised her in the house as a pet.  They  patted\r\n\r\nher.   They gave her milk.  She had food every day.   She\r\n\r\nslept  in their bed.  She played with them, and she  grew\r\n\r\nup  to be a very inept young lioness because she did  not\r\n\r\nknow  how  to hunt.  One day, the time came  for  her  to\r\n\r\nreturn  to the wild and there was no other way to  do  it\r\n\r\nexcept  to  reintroduce her to the wild  by  leaving  her\r\n\r\nthere.  And she was really upset because she had no  idea\r\n\r\nwhat  to do, no idea what to hunt.  She kept coming back,\r\n\r\nlooking  for food.  She found a male lion, and  those  of\r\n\r\nyou  who are familiar with the habits of lions will  know\r\n\r\nthat  the male lion does not hunt, the lioness has to  go\r\n\r\nout  and  bring  him  food.  So, he found  this  lioness,\r\n\r\nfairly  young, attractive looking, who was pretty useless\r\n\r\nat  the job because she could not bring back the kill, so\r\n\r\nthat did not work out either.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had a long hard time out in the wilderness and\r\n\r\nsuffered quite a bit before she eventually learned how to\r\n\r\nfend  for  herself and how to hunt and how to  kill,  and\r\n\r\neventually had her own family, which she raised.  And, it\r\n\r\nis  like  that  with Singaporeans, because  we  had  been\r\n\r\nbuffered from a lot of things.  We were a lion city.   We\r\n\r\ncome   from  immigrant  stocks.   We  still  have   those\r\n\r\ninstincts  to  hunt, but some of them have  been  blunted\r\n\r\nover  the  years  simply because we  have  had  a  fairly\r\n\r\ncomfortable life.  I do not think that the instincts  are\r\n\r\ngone.   I just think that if we are put in an environment\r\n\r\nwhere  we have to use those instincts they will  come  to\r\n\r\nthe  fore.  So, being a good entrepreneur does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat you succeed because of the Government.  The mark  of\r\n\r\na   really  good  entrepreneur  is  to  succeed   despite\r\n\r\nGovernment.  That is what a good entrepreneur is.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice also recently that SPH or Times Periodicals\r\n\r\nhas  come up with these awards:  Woman of the Year; Young\r\n\r\nWoman  Achiever.   Woman of the Year  Award  was  won  by\r\n\r\nOlivia Lum.  The Young Woman Achiever was Elim Chew.   In\r\n\r\ntheir  acceptance speeches, two things stood  out.   What\r\n\r\nthey  had  in common, both of them, was strong  religious\r\n\r\nfaith,  and  a gung-ho attitude.  I also notice  that  in\r\n\r\nOlivia's case, her school results were good.  Elim in her\r\n\r\nacceptance speech, said that she was always bordering  on\r\n\r\nnot doing very well and her school results were not good.\r\n\r\nBut  they  are both today in a position where  they  have\r\n\r\nmade  something  for  themselves and the  common  factor,\r\n\r\napart  from  the  fact  that they are  young  female  and\r\n\r\nsingle, is that they have really good attitude.  They are\r\n\r\ngo-getters and they are gung-ho.  And that is the sort of\r\n\r\nthing   that  we need in Singapore today.   That  is  the\r\n\r\nattitude that will make this Budget work or not work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a second wrong question that has been\r\n\r\nasked,  which  is: where are the goodies in this  Budget?\r\n\r\nIn  a time like this, one does not look for goodies.   It\r\n\r\nis really time to batten down the hatches and get to work\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  stimulating our  economy  and  making  the\r\n\r\nopportunities for ourselves.  The goodies, as I  see  it,\r\n\r\nhave  come  in  an  indirect form   -   the  measures  to\r\n\r\nstimulate  business,  the rebates,  eg,  on  service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy charges, the deferment of the GST  - that  is\r\n\r\na  pretty  large  goody; you just do  not  see  it  in  a\r\n\r\ntangible form, but it is a very big goody  -  the  budget\r\n\r\nfor retraining.  This Budget is all about what we make of\r\n\r\nourselves  and  the  ability to stay  relevant  in  these\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small group of Singaporeans who really\r\n\r\nneed  this  help, but there is a very large  majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who can help themselves, and the  difference\r\n\r\nis  what you make of it.  One example is a lady who  came\r\n\r\nto  see  me at my meet-the-people session.  She has  been\r\n\r\ndoing  low-skilled jobs.  Her husband had  just  recently\r\n\r\nbeen  retrenched.  She wanted to try and get a job  as  a\r\n\r\ncashier and she found that she could not, because she did\r\n\r\nnot have IT skills.  In today's environment,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanybody  who wants to work as a cashier will have  to  be\r\n\r\nable to use a computer.  She is going to be faced with  a\r\n\r\nchoice.   She has got a choice of not learning IT  skills\r\n\r\nand  she  will always remain low-skilled and, eventually,\r\n\r\nmarginalised and irrelevant, or she can go ahead and make\r\n\r\nthat  choice  to  learn  basic IT  and,  eventually,  get\r\n\r\nherself  a job.  But that choice is hers and hers  alone.\r\n\r\nThe Government cannot make that choice for her.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goodies this year did not come in the form of a\r\n\r\nsweet dessert.  For Members  who are familiar with Indian\r\n\r\nfood, they may know of a dessert called ghulab jamun.  It\r\n\r\nis  the most absolutely divine dessert.  It is made  from\r\n\r\nmilk  powder.   It is made into little balls  and  soaked\r\n\r\novernight  in  golden syrup.  It is absolutely  wonderful\r\n\r\nand  it  is  like  an  instant sugar injection,  and  one\r\n\r\nprobably gets an instant cardiac arrest after eating it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget did not come in the form of a\r\n\r\nbowl of ghulab jamun.  It came in the form of a plate  of\r\n\r\nfresh fruit with a handful of vitamins, Omega 3 and Omega\r\n\r\n6 oils and a bunch of antioxidants.  It does not taste as\r\n\r\ngood but it is a whole lot better for the system.  So, it\r\n\r\nis just a question of what we make of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my next topic. International\r\n\r\nWomen's   Day  was  on  8th  March  2003.    Every   time\r\n\r\nInternational  Women's Day comes around,  there  is  this\r\n\r\ndiscussion of women's issues and the question  of  gender\r\n\r\nequality  crops up.  There is one area in which Singapore\r\n\r\nwomen  do  not  have  equality with Singapore  men.   For\r\n\r\nvarious  reasons, we have lagged behind, though it  seems\r\n\r\nthe gap is narrowing.  As far as I am concerned, this  is\r\n\r\none  area  where we should remain firmly unequal  and  we\r\n\r\nshould stay far behind the men where we belong, and  this\r\n\r\nis  in  the area of cigarette smoking.  I firmly  support\r\n\r\nthe  increased excise duty on cigarettes and the decision\r\n\r\nto tax cigarettes by sticks instead of weight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted with concern the fact that although the\r\n\r\nproportion  of smokers in Singapore dropped from  18%  in\r\n\r\n1992 to 14% in 2001, the percentage of young\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfemale smokers aged 18-24 increased from 2.8% to 8.2%  in\r\n\r\nthe  same period.  This is a danger signal because  those\r\n\r\nwho  start  at  a very young age find it harder  to  quit\r\n\r\nlater  on in life.  And if this trend continues, then  in\r\n\r\nthe  next 15-30 years, there is going to be a substantial\r\n\r\nincrease in smoking-related health costs among the  young\r\n\r\nwomen who are picking up the habit now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigarette smoking was initially adopted by men in\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries  in the West followed  by  women  in\r\n\r\nthose  countries.   It  then  spread  to  the  developing\r\n\r\ncountries including Asia.  And the relatively low use  of\r\n\r\ntobacco  by  women as opposed to men is  not  because  of\r\n\r\nbetter  health awareness.  It is attributable  to  social\r\n\r\nand  cultural traditions and, in the past, the fact  that\r\n\r\nwomen  had less money to spend.  The trouble is that  now\r\n\r\nthey  do  have more money to spend.  More are picking  up\r\n\r\nthe habit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons seem to be the same as that for young\r\n\r\nmen,  which is curiosity, peer pressure, need to  relieve\r\n\r\nstress,   desire  to  impress  friends,  and  to  relieve\r\n\r\nboredom.   For  women  -  for young girls  especially   - they  think it keeps them slim.  The problem is that this\r\n\r\ndoes  not  seem  to  be balanced by an awareness  of  the\r\n\r\ndangers of it.   The dangers are well known.  Lung cancer\r\n\r\nis the most obvious risk.  That used to be a rare disease\r\n\r\nin  the  early decades of the 20th century.  But  by  the\r\n\r\n1950s,  it was a leading cause of cancer death among  men\r\n\r\nin developed countries.  Now, it is also becoming a cause\r\n\r\nof death among women.  And what is little known about the\r\n\r\nfact  of  lung cancer is that what you really die  of  is\r\n\r\nsuffocation.  You die because you cannot breathe.  It  is\r\n\r\na  horrible way to go, and smoking leads to that.   There\r\n\r\nis   also   risk   linked   to  pregnancy,   infertility,\r\n\r\ncardiovascular disease, stroke, haemorrhage and on top of\r\n\r\nall  that, you get wrinkles as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A World Health Organisation report noted that the\r\n\r\nsad fact is this.  If women smoke like men, they will die\r\n\r\nlike men.  It is not a good way to go.  And, frankly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeaking,  I think that it is a very good thing  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  raised the tax of cigarettes.  What does this  have\r\n\r\nto  do  with the Budget, you may ask?  It has an indirect\r\n\r\nimpact  in  that it actually saves on medical and  health\r\n\r\ncosts.   That is the benefit that we will see maybe  only\r\n\r\nin  15-30 years.  But the Ministry of Health today has to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  medical  and  health costs  of  dealing  with\r\n\r\ndiseases arising from practices that people adopted 15 or\r\n\r\n30  years ago.  Studies have shown that smokers are  very\r\n\r\nresponsible to fiscal measures and I think that  the  tax\r\n\r\nincrease on cigarettes is a very good move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to start by saying that I think the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister has strived to come  out  with  what  I\r\n\r\nthink is a very prudent and balanced Budget in a time  of\r\n\r\ngreat  challenge.   I  say \"balanced\"  because  there  is\r\n\r\nclearly   an   attempt  to  reconcile   some   short-term\r\n\r\nimperatives  with the longer-term competitive  challenges\r\n\r\nthat Singapore faces.  I say \"prudent\" because it is also\r\n\r\ntrying to position Singapore for the long haul and trying\r\n\r\nto  educate Singaporeans on the need, and all this whilst\r\n\r\nwe have a modest deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think many people have commented that this\r\n\r\nBudget  lacks the silver bullet, lacks the path  breaking\r\n\r\nrecommendations which are going to deliver us to the  new\r\n\r\nland  of  opportunity and prosperity.   I  think  it  was\r\n\r\nAristotle who said excellence is a habit.  And I think we\r\n\r\nshould  be  in the habit of looking for consistent,  good\r\n\r\nbudgets and policies which will get us to our final goal,\r\n\r\nand  not  look for the magic bullet, because sometimes  a\r\n\r\nmagic  bullet may not be so magical and it may come  back\r\n\r\nat us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a measure of the challenges we face in this\r\n\r\nenvironment today is perhaps best understood if  we  look\r\n\r\nat  the  budget  that  was announced  by  the  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\ngovernment  recently as well.  Their  corporate  tax  was\r\n\r\nincreased by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5%;  personal tax and property tax were also  increased\r\n\r\nby  1%.   I  think it is going to be phased in  over  two\r\n\r\nyears.   So,  they  have  gone  up  to  171/2%  and   16%\r\n\r\nrespectively  for corporate and personal taxes.   Levies,\r\n\r\nincluding the foreign maid levy, have been introduced  in\r\n\r\nHong Kong at the expense of the pay  of the foreign maids\r\n\r\nin  Hong  Kong.   And  perhaps most  significant  is  the\r\n\r\ndeficit  forecast.  For the year ending March  2003,  the\r\n\r\nforecast  is  for  a  HK$70  billion  deficit,  ie,  S$16\r\n\r\nbillion.   For the next financial year, the  forecast  is\r\n\r\nfor a HK$68 billion deficit, ie, S$15-16 billion.  In the\r\n\r\nsubsequent  two years, Antony Leung continues  to  expect\r\n\r\nthat there will be deficits in Hong Kong.  There is a lot\r\n\r\nof  speculation about the robustness of the  peg  of  the\r\n\r\nHong  Kong dollar as a result of these forecast  deficits\r\n\r\nand,  more  fundamentally, the question is:   is  this  a\r\n\r\nstructural  problem for Hong Kong or something  cyclical,\r\n\r\nas  they assert, which they can come out of in the medium\r\n\r\nterm?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we contrast that with Singapore, although\r\n\r\nmuch has been said about a third year of deficit and some\r\n\r\nhave actually asked whether this is a departure from  the\r\n\r\nhistory of fiscal prudence that we have had, clearly, the\r\n\r\nanswer  is no.  And one need go no further than refer  to\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister's speech itself where he  made  the\r\n\r\nassertion that fiscal prudence remains a cornerstone  and\r\n\r\nover  a  cycle  of business, the objective  is  still  to\r\n\r\nachieve  a  balanced, if not modest surplus, budget.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  if we look at FY 2002, if we exclude the transfers\r\n\r\nto  the  endowment items like the Lifelong Learning  Fund\r\n\r\nwhich  is  about half a billion dollars, and the  Medical\r\n\r\nEndowment Fund which is about $100 million, there was  in\r\n\r\nfact a modest surplus in the last financial year of about\r\n\r\n$1/2  billion.  And for this financial year that  we  are\r\n\r\nnow debating, the deficit is about $0.9 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, from that perspective, if we look at the\r\n\r\nlast  three years, what we have seen is that first  there\r\n\r\nwas  a deficit year; last year was somewhat of a balanced\r\n\r\nyear;  and  now we are forecasting a deficit year  again,\r\n\r\nwhich really is not that alarming and which has therefore\r\n\r\ngiven rise to questions as to whether Government can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  more to give a boost, especially when we look at  the\r\n\r\nsituation in last year's budget as well as the comparison\r\n\r\nwith Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had many debates in this House against the\r\n\r\nnotion  of  deficit funding or pump priming the  economy.\r\n\r\nSome  of  those  include the fact that ours  is  a  small\r\n\r\neconomy  which  has  a substantial reliance  on  external\r\n\r\ndemand.  And the flip side of the coin is that efforts to\r\n\r\nboost   domestic   demand,  whether  it  is   consumption\r\n\r\nexpenditure or Government spending, will have  a  limited\r\n\r\nimpact, and we also allow for the fact that there will be\r\n\r\nsubstantial leakages from our spending.  But given  that,\r\n\r\nI  think  it would still be useful for all in this  House\r\n\r\nand  Singaporeans  in general to better  understand  what\r\n\r\nwould be the actual quantitative impact of such elements.\r\n\r\nBecause  the  question  is:  could  we  not  afford  such\r\n\r\nleakages or such less than complete effectiveness in pump\r\n\r\npriming, and still consider additional spending in a time\r\n\r\nof  some  uncertainty where a boost is  required  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  bearing in mind that overall  in  the  business\r\n\r\ncycle,  we  could still achieve a surplus or  a  balanced\r\n\r\nbudget?   I  would appreciate it if the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\ncould  clarify these elements, because this is a repeated\r\n\r\ncomment  that emerges from the business sector and  other\r\n\r\nquarters as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is certainly an air of uncertainty that\r\n\r\npervades  the  economy and, in general, all Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nand there are many reasons for this which  have been well\r\n\r\ncanvassed  here   -   the  political  uncertainties,  the\r\n\r\nlooming possibility of a war in Iraq and also the general\r\n\r\neconomic outlook which is not so bright.  But I think key\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in recent times which have had  a  profound\r\n\r\nimpact  on  Singaporeans' sense of optimism or hope  have\r\n\r\nbeen  the reorganisation that has occurred in the  public\r\n\r\nsector  through the HDB and, to some extent, also in  the\r\n\r\nsector  that  is  deemed to be linked to  the  Government\r\n\r\nthrough  the  PSA.  Some have spoken to me and  they  see\r\n\r\nthis as a breach of an article of faith  -  the iron rice\r\n\r\nbowl   -   the  expectation that when you  work  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  a  large  organisation,  although  it  is\r\n\r\nprivate but linked to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment, there is a certain expectation that you  will\r\n\r\nbe  cared  for or that there will be a certain  long-term\r\n\r\ncommitment to keep you employed.\r\n\r\nClearly,   the  recent  developments  have  fundamentally\r\n\r\nchanged  that perception.  And the question is:  has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment lost touch with the plight of the average  man\r\n\r\nin Singapore?  Put another way, for example, the question\r\n\r\nis:   can  we cut wages?  Why must we cut jobs?  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  question that is raised time and again.  And I think\r\n\r\nthat  those who raised this question perhaps have  failed\r\n\r\nto understand the difference between an anaesthetic and a\r\n\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting cost, in my view, is really the equivalent\r\n\r\nof  an anaesthetic in this environment.  Without a lot of\r\n\r\ndetailed information, but having looked at many companies\r\n\r\nthat  have gone through these exercises in the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears,  cost  reduction, in terms of cutting  across-the-board wages, might relieve the company's pressure on  the\r\n\r\nbottomline  for  the  short term,  but  it  will  have  a\r\n\r\ndebilitating effect on its ability to manage its  talent,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are cutting the wages of all, regardless  of\r\n\r\nperformance.   At the same time, it does not  necessarily\r\n\r\naddress the root causes of the problems which compel  the\r\n\r\ncompany to take the actions that it is taking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The causes could be many. It could be that there is\r\n\r\na need to reorganise to focus on core business.  It could\r\n\r\nbe  because of renewed competition which has structurally\r\n\r\noccurred  in  recent  times  and  therefore  compelled  a\r\n\r\nreassessment  of the whole environment.  Ultimately,  one\r\n\r\ncould  argue that there is no such thing as a  good  time\r\n\r\nfor retrenchments.  Even in the best of times, we have  a\r\n\r\nproblem.  Mr Chiam brought up examples of companies  like\r\n\r\nCSM and so on, and I can understand that, as a Member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition, he wishes to make political capital  out\r\n\r\nof  unemployment.  But my concern is that at a time  like\r\n\r\nthis  - and I think Mr Chiam himself has said - many come\r\n\r\nwith  real  problems   -   we  need  to  give  them  real\r\n\r\nsolutions, not political rhetoric in trying to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe issues of the day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, the starting point must be to see\r\n\r\nwhy this is happening and whether there is a way to avoid\r\n\r\nit.   Or,  if  we do it, is it just an anaesthetic  which\r\n\r\ndulls  the  pain,  delays the inevitable  and,  when  the\r\n\r\ninevitable  comes,  it would be far sharper  and  graver?\r\n\r\nAnd  let us contemplate the cost of inaction.  If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  do  these things, or if these companies do not  take\r\n\r\nthe action, then it could be argued that the viability of\r\n\r\nthe  whole company and its business is at stake.  And  we\r\n\r\nare not talking about 10% or 15% of the workforce; we are\r\n\r\ntalking  about everybody.  That is a consequence that  is\r\n\r\nfar graver.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of public-sector organisations, such as\r\n\r\nHDB,  whilst it is painful for the individuals  affected,\r\n\r\nit  could  be  argued that it is far better to  take  the\r\n\r\nbitter pill now, focus on the core issues, and find  ways\r\n\r\nto help those affected through the transition, because Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  himself will argue later why we are raising  taxes\r\n\r\nor why the Government is spending so much.  Measures like\r\n\r\nthese do help the public sector to become leaner and,  as\r\n\r\na  result, reduce the pressure on tax rates, allowing  us\r\n\r\nto put more back into the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, there are elements in this\r\n\r\nBudget  which give Singaporeans cause for a lot of  hope.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  a  cause  for euphoria, and  anyone  who  is\r\n\r\nunrealistically optimistic has to really  be  challenged.\r\n\r\nBut  I think there is a cause for measured optimism.  And\r\n\r\nthat  is  not only because of the many reasons that  have\r\n\r\nbeen  discussed  in this House, including  the  intrinsic\r\n\r\nstrength  of  Singapore financially, but  also  in  other\r\n\r\nmeasures in terms of our social cohesion, etc, and  other\r\n\r\ninitiatives  that  are being taken up at  quite  a  rapid\r\n\r\npace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External opportunities through bilateral and\r\n\r\nregional   Free   Trade   Agreements   and   multilateral\r\n\r\narrangements, all of these have a significant  impact  on\r\n\r\nexpanding  the  space  for  Singaporean  companies   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, opportunities for Singaporeans.  What we might\r\n\r\nnot have today is an effective means of communicating the\r\n\r\nvalue of such macro initiatives to the micro level.  Some\r\n\r\ncompanies know how\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  use these to their advantage, but many would need  to\r\n\r\nbe helped.  And this is an area where I hope the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Trade and Industry and others involved in the process\r\n\r\nwould  be actively disseminating information on the  FTAs\r\n\r\nand  trying to get businesses to understand how they  can\r\n\r\nturn these to their advantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major initiative that has been announced\r\n\r\nis  this thrust and emphasis on entrepreneurship.  Again,\r\n\r\nI  approach this with some trepidation, because it is not\r\n\r\nas  if  entrepreneurship is the panacea for our problems.\r\n\r\nIt  is  one plank in the bridge over this difficult  time\r\n\r\nand, if it is done well, it might indeed become - to  use\r\n\r\na  different analogy - the engine that will really  boost\r\n\r\nthe  rocket.  But it would be unrealistic and unwise  for\r\n\r\nus  to  put all our bets in this one basket and say  that\r\n\r\nthis is going to be the solution to all our problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, I would also like to echo the point raised\r\n\r\nby  the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, Ms Indranee Rajah,\r\n\r\nbecause I think we do have an element of schizophrenia in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Entrepreneurs will, on the  one  hand,  say,\r\n\r\n\"The  Government should leave the private  sector  alone.\r\n\r\nLet   us   charge  out  there.   Let  us  do  our  things\r\n\r\nourselves.\"  But they will also, on the other hand,  say,\r\n\r\n\"But  we  need you to help us.  We need you to  do  this,\r\n\r\nthat,  and so on\" - whether it is a subsidy, a grant,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever.   To some extent, that schizophrenia  is  quite\r\n\r\nunderstandable:  you want to have your cake and  eat  it,\r\n\r\nand that is fine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the Government's perspective - and this is\r\n\r\nwhere I come to the policy proposal - having appointed  a\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  for Entrepreneurship,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nexpectations  are  there in the market  as  to  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be  able to do to  effectively  promote\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  in Singapore.  Mr Raymond  Lim  made  a\r\n\r\nvery  eloquent statement on what he thinks his role  will\r\n\r\nbe and will not be, and the example of the Silicon Valley\r\n\r\nis  a case in point.  Silicon Valley thrived, in my view,\r\n\r\ndespite   government,  although  government   expenditure\r\n\r\nfuelled it.  But there was not the rules-bound and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregulation-bound mentality that hamstrung Silicon Valley.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, perhaps the key role for the Minister of State\r\n\r\nfor  Entrepreneurship and the Government  in  general  in\r\n\r\nthis  area  is  to focus, primarily, on the mindset,  ie,\r\n\r\npromote a risk-taking mindset and, secondly, to focus  on\r\n\r\nthe  environment,  so  as  to remove  impediments  whilst\r\n\r\nreinforcing any enabling criteria or factors we  have  in\r\n\r\nour   environment   to   promote  entrepreneurship   and,\r\n\r\nultimately, to have a champion for the cause.  Unless you\r\n\r\nhave a champion, this message may be lost.  We need it to\r\n\r\nbe  reiterated  time  and again,  so  that  it  resonates\r\n\r\neverywhere in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I want to make is that having\r\n\r\nestablished some positive areas where more will  be  done\r\n\r\nand   can   be   done  for  Singaporeans  in   terms   of\r\n\r\nopportunities, I do feel that, in the short term, perhaps\r\n\r\nwe could consider additional assistance for those who are\r\n\r\nin  difficulty.   Most  of our measures  in  the  helping\r\n\r\nSingaporeans aspect of this Budget are targeted at  those\r\n\r\nwho  are at the lower strata in terms of income.   It  is\r\n\r\nright  that our resources be targeted at this  group  who\r\n\r\nare  in greatest need.  But, like the hon. Member for Ang\r\n\r\nMo  Kio, Mr Inderjit Singh, I do believe that because  of\r\n\r\nthe  nature and scale of the retrenchments we are  seeing\r\n\r\ntoday, there is a sandwich class of Singaporeans who  are\r\n\r\nhurting.  By normal criteria of wealth measures, such  as\r\n\r\nassets owned and so on, they would actually be deemed  to\r\n\r\nbe  quite well-off, but, from a cash flow point of  view,\r\n\r\nthey  are hard pressed.  The response of asking  them  to\r\n\r\nliquidate some assets would be a lot more credible if the\r\n\r\nmarket was indeed a liquid market.  But in many instances\r\n\r\ntoday,  where  some  are in housing loans  with  negative\r\n\r\nequities  and so on, this might actually be  a  difficult\r\n\r\nscenario.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting we therefore swing to a welfare\r\n\r\nstate, with a lot of unemployment benefits and a plethora\r\n\r\nof  other assistance schemes.  But whilst I subscribe  to\r\n\r\ntough love - which was a point that Ms Indranee Rajah was\r\n\r\nmaking in talking about us being more self-reliant - I do\r\n\r\nthink that there is a process to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanaged here.  When my daughter was learning to ride  the\r\n\r\nbicycle, I gave her trainer wheels first.  Then, when she\r\n\r\nwas  a little bit more confident, I kinked it up, removed\r\n\r\nthe trainer wheels, held the seat, and then let her go!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we need to go through such an arduous\r\n\r\nprocess in this philosophical shift.  But there is a case\r\n\r\nto  be made for some short-term forms of assistance which\r\n\r\nwill  deliver some relief to those who have  worked  very\r\n\r\nhard  in  Singapore  over  the  years,  but  due  to  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances shifting quite suddenly in some cases, they\r\n\r\nare  caught in a difficult spot.  This may not require  a\r\n\r\nlarge resource allocation, but perhaps more a tweaking of\r\n\r\nexisting rules in terms of how they can in fact tap their\r\n\r\nown  resources, whether it is through CPF or other means,\r\n\r\nsuch  as reverse mortgages, and special schemes for them.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  do  hope  that the Government will consider  that\r\n\r\nseriously in the next year as a means of helping those in\r\n\r\nthis sandwich class.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, last week I was in\r\n\r\nShanghai  for  a  seminar  to  promote  listings  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Stock Exchange.  The seminar  was  held  in  a\r\n\r\nmodern  international 5-star hotel located at the  rather\r\n\r\nfashionable  Bund  in  Shanghai.   More  than  a  hundred\r\n\r\ninterested  parties attended, each of whom was  carefully\r\n\r\nscreened  ahead of time to ensure that they  are  serious\r\n\r\nand profitable participants.  The hall was packed.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  attended took earnest notes and looked very  serious\r\n\r\nabout going overseas to raise their profile and, perhaps,\r\n\r\ncapital.   Perhaps, this reflects the strong vibrancy  of\r\n\r\nthe  increasingly powerful Chinese economy.  This was not\r\n\r\nonly evident in the seminar room, but was clearly visible\r\n\r\nin  the  streets, shops and eating-places  in  the  city.\r\n\r\nHowever, that was not what struck me.  What struck me was\r\n\r\na  conversation  I  had with a local accountant  who  was\r\n\r\npresent  at  the  seminar.  He told me that  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  they  cannot go on  competing  on  cheap\r\n\r\nlabour  and land alone.  He recognised that in order  for\r\n\r\nChina to continue powering away, they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust strive to move up the value chain and build on local\r\n\r\nbrand  names  that  are recognised internationally.   Far\r\n\r\nfrom just wanting to be the back-lane sweatshops for some\r\n\r\nother  people's inventions, they have strong  aspirations\r\n\r\nto be the Toyotas, IBMs and Panasonics of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My conversation with the Chinese accountant made me\r\n\r\nrealise  how fast and how aggressive the Chinese  are  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  scale the ladder of economic  development  to\r\n\r\nbecome  a  developed nation, rivalling the  US  in  every\r\n\r\naspect.   And I shudder to think of what this  would  all\r\n\r\nmean  to  Singapore, its economy and the  future  of  its\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is surely that the gap of\r\n\r\ncomparative  advantage that Singapore has over  competing\r\n\r\nand emerging economies is fast eroding.  In Singapore, we\r\n\r\nhave  always prided ourselves in having a brand name that\r\n\r\nis  instantly recognisable and respected the world  over.\r\n\r\nWe  can  always leverage on this to charge a premium  for\r\n\r\nour  products  and services.  And it is this  brand  name\r\n\r\nwhich  I  believe that will hold the key  to  our  future\r\n\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way forward for our country is not to take China\r\n\r\non  in this competition game, but to see how we can  lean\r\n\r\non  our unique qualities of being a well-run, hardworking\r\n\r\nand  honest English-speaking society to ensure our future\r\n\r\nsurvival.  What do I mean?  Sir, please allow me to  take\r\n\r\na  leaf from the humble shoemaker.  On a value chain, the\r\n\r\ncommon  perception is that shoe-making and  selling  does\r\n\r\nnot quite occupy the same space as bio-medical science or\r\n\r\nrocket   engineering   science.    Yet,   in   terms   of\r\n\r\nprofitability  and size of global reach,  there  is  huge\r\n\r\npotential in this business.  Take Nike, for example.   No\r\n\r\none  would deny that Nike today is a global multinational\r\n\r\nwhose  products  can be found in almost every  nation  on\r\n\r\nearth.  Most people would have either heard of the  brand\r\n\r\nor  even  own a pair of Nike.  There are many people  out\r\n\r\nthere, including many young boys and girls who would give\r\n\r\na  limb for a pair of Nike.  They are not able to own  it\r\n\r\nbecause  a  pair of Nike shoes is just too expensive  for\r\n\r\nmany.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  those  who can afford it will not think twice  about\r\n\r\npaying  premium  money for it.  Yet, we  know  that  Nike\r\n\r\noutsources  the  manufacturing  of  its  shoes   to   the\r\n\r\nsweatshops   in   China,  Vietnam  and  Indonesia.    The\r\n\r\nfactories  that churn out these shoes for Nike  have  the\r\n\r\ncapability  of  producing similar type shoes.   The  main\r\n\r\ndifference is that they cannot put the famous swoosh mark\r\n\r\non it, but some other brands, like Double Flying Wheel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nike and Double Flying Wheel, which do you think\r\n\r\nwill sell if they are both priced the same?  Nike is  not\r\n\r\nin  the business of manufacturing.  They are quite  happy\r\n\r\nto  leave  this to others.  They are in the  business  of\r\n\r\nbranding  and  selling and creating in the minds  of  the\r\n\r\nconsumers  a  certain desire of wanting to  own  and  use\r\n\r\ntheir products.  By doing that, they have added much more\r\n\r\nvalue  to  just  ordinary shoes.  I do not believe,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  a  pair of Double Flying Wheel shoes should be  any\r\n\r\nworse off in quality than your Nike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people choose Nike? There are numerous\r\n\r\nreasons.  And this is not a forum for us to go into these\r\n\r\nreasons.   However, I will just dwell on one.  I  believe\r\n\r\nit  has  to  do with the American brand name.   There  is\r\n\r\nsomehow  a  certain cache in the minds of most  consumers\r\n\r\nthat  if the product came from America, it must be  of  a\r\n\r\ngood  quality.   For  the same reason,  we  see  in  some\r\n\r\nadvertisements  that specific mention is  often  made  of\r\n\r\nsome consumer electronic items being from Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people I have spoken to tell me that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  not America or Japan, and that it would be impossible\r\n\r\nfor a boy from the backwaters to make it big in the city.\r\n\r\nI  used  to think that was the case.  However,  over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  we  come across numerous examples of how a  small\r\n\r\nand  provincial company, or even an individual, was  able\r\n\r\nto take on the world and the world became his oyster.   I\r\n\r\ncheered  recently, when I read of how a local Singaporean\r\n\r\nboy  was able to build a name for himself by selling  his\r\n\r\nline  of  clothes  in competition with  the  big  fashion\r\n\r\nhouses in Paris and New York; and is able to claim Nicole\r\n\r\nKidman and the late Princess Diana as his clients.   This\r\n\r\nboy fortunately came from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na family who is able to provide financial support for his\r\n\r\ndreams.   Just  think,  if  he  did  not  have  such   an\r\n\r\nopportunity,  he  would  probably  be  left  selling  his\r\n\r\nclothes  in some run-down plaza in Orchard Road  and  the\r\n\r\nworld would have passed him by without noticing him.  And\r\n\r\nof  course, would his clothes sell for the prices that he\r\n\r\nis  now  selling?  Who would be the bigger loser  in  the\r\n\r\nlong run?  Singapore or the boy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must pay more attention to brand building and\r\n\r\nbrand  management.  The question is:  how?   Sir,  in  my\r\n\r\nprevious  speeches,  I  had  made  some  suggestions   on\r\n\r\napproaches.  The first would be to strategically  acquire\r\n\r\nor   acquire   substantial   stakes   to   enable   board\r\n\r\nrepresentation in companies with very strong global brand\r\n\r\nnames.  In doing so, we not only acquire global companies\r\n\r\nthat  would help contribute to our total revenue but,  if\r\n\r\nmanaged, would allow Singaporeans the ability to  have  a\r\n\r\ndeeper  and  better  understanding  about  the  ways   to\r\n\r\ninternational branding and marketing.  Secondly,  I  note\r\n\r\nfrom the ERC Report that the proposal was made in respect\r\n\r\nof  the setting up of an IP academy.  While I welcome the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  such an academy, I am  just  concerned\r\n\r\nthat,  first, the approach taken by the academy may  just\r\n\r\nbe  too  academic  and may not deal  with  the  practical\r\n\r\ndifficulties   of   managing   intellectual   properties.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  the  academy may just be  another  institution\r\n\r\nthat  is  divorced  from the reality of  industry  to  be\r\n\r\neffective.   Given  the broad reach  of  the  subject  of\r\n\r\nintellectual  property, I do hope that the academy  would\r\n\r\nalso  devote  much  attention to  the  subject  of  brand\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  brand management which, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  yet  again, has not been given enough  serious\r\n\r\npolicy consideration that it deserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of being simplistic, the world of\r\n\r\nbusiness  is  very much about branding and selling.   The\r\n\r\nbetter  you are able to market and position your products\r\n\r\nand  services, the better it is for you to cream off more\r\n\r\nfat for your bottom line.  Everyone can manufacture a PC,\r\n\r\nit  is  only a question of unit cost production  to  stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  But not everyone can create a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDell  or a Compaq brand name that sells around the world.\r\n\r\nIn fact, most Dell computers are manufactured and shipped\r\n\r\nout to China; but who makes the big profits?  The Chinese\r\n\r\nare  fast recognising the importance of the game and will\r\n\r\nsoon  play  catch up.  We, in Singapore, still  have  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  a name that the world trusts.   We  should\r\n\r\ncapitalise  on  it or run the risk of being  marginalised\r\n\r\nand lose the advantage that we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note the affirmation of our Government that\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   will  continue  to  form   an   important\r\n\r\nunderpinning  of  our  economy.   I  would  support   the\r\n\r\naffirmation,  provided that the manufacturing  activities\r\n\r\nthat  we support would allow us to take advantage of  our\r\n\r\ncomparative advantage in relation to China and the  other\r\n\r\nemerging economies.  I would question whether or  not  we\r\n\r\nare  better  off leaving manufacturing to the  others  in\r\n\r\nmost instances.  The logic of the globalisation argument,\r\n\r\nas  we  are  all aware, lies in the fact that labour  and\r\n\r\ncapital  in  an  increasingly open  world  economy  would\r\n\r\nalways  gravitate  towards  places  that  are  most  cost\r\n\r\neffective through sheer market forces.  It could well  be\r\n\r\nthat,  in many of our traditional industries, it may  not\r\n\r\nbe  more  efficient for Singapore to keep  them.   And  I\r\n\r\nwould  be  so  bold as to predict that, in  the  next  10\r\n\r\nyears,  many  of  our contract manufacturing  facilities,\r\n\r\nincluding   those  that  are  presently  found   in   the\r\n\r\nelectronics sector, will eventually be relocated to China\r\n\r\nand other places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way forward for Singapore is to consider its\r\n\r\ncomparative   advantage  rather  than   its   competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage.    Singapore's strength has  always  been  its\r\n\r\nwell-qualified English-speaking younger generation of the\r\n\r\npost-independence people and the quality  of  its  public\r\n\r\nservice.   Additionally, the fact that it is  small  also\r\n\r\nmeans  that it is nimble and could transform itself quite\r\n\r\neasily.   Clearly, Singapore can be a leading centre  for\r\n\r\nresearch   and   development  and  brand   building   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   The  overall  total  licensing  market  is\r\n\r\nestimated to be some $300 billion a year.  If Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  aspire  to clinch even 5% of that  share  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  we  might as well give up any pretensions  about\r\n\r\nbeing a global industrial nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able, Sir, to develop strong global brand\r\n\r\nnames,  we  would  be able to build up a strong  external\r\n\r\neconomy,  which  will  then  give  us  much  room  to  be\r\n\r\ninefficient  in our domestic economy.  For  instance,  we\r\n\r\ncan  earn  enough  more  from  our  external  economy  to\r\n\r\nconsider  some form of subvention or fiscal incentive  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  employment of those who are  structurally\r\n\r\nunemployed,  especially  the  middle-aged  workers.   For\r\n\r\nthem,  we do not have to measure their efficiency against\r\n\r\nthe  workers  from  countries where cheap  and  untrained\r\n\r\nlabour  exists  in  abundance.  The unit  cost  of  these\r\n\r\nunskilled  middle-aged Singaporean workers  can  then  be\r\n\r\nmatched  more  attractively  with  the  support  of   our\r\n\r\nGovernment.   This  will provide employers  here  with  a\r\n\r\ngreater  incentive to hire local employees as opposed  to\r\n\r\nforeign employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that the Government does not always\r\n\r\nwelcome  any  suggestion of public subsidy,  in  whatever\r\n\r\nform.   The  conventional wisdom is that  public  subsidy\r\n\r\nrobs  the  incentive  from individuals  to  work  and  to\r\n\r\nimprove  themselves.  While that may be true in  general,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no comparison when the argument is scrutinised\r\n\r\nmore  closely.   It  would be true  to  say  that  social\r\n\r\nbenefits  generally  tend to make a  person  lazy  and  a\r\n\r\nsloth.   However, what we are speaking here is to give  a\r\n\r\nman back his dignity by giving him work that he would not\r\n\r\notherwise  be  given,  but for the  intervention  of  the\r\n\r\nstate.  I know that such a policy may not satisfy in  the\r\n\r\nlonger  term  the  requirement  of  economic  efficiency.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the point of the matter is that we do not  need\r\n\r\nour  domestic economy to be efficient all the time if our\r\n\r\nexternal economy is powering away strongly, such that  it\r\n\r\nallows  us  this  option.  These structurally  unemployed\r\n\r\nworkers are still Singaporeans, and we will still have to\r\n\r\ncarry  them.   Rather than give them handouts,  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  duty  to do if they are truly down,  it  may  be\r\n\r\nbetter to subsidise them indirectly through employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now at what most would consider the most\r\n\r\nsignificant crossroads of our nation's history.   We  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with having to make choices that would decide  our\r\n\r\npeople's  fate.  If we take the wrong path,  the  outcome\r\n\r\ncould  well  be very different.  The one salutary  lesson\r\n\r\nthat  we  have before us is New Zealand.  Like Singapore,\r\n\r\nNew Zealand was very much at the crossroads since the mid-80s.   New  Zealand also realised the need to restructure\r\n\r\nits economy and to raise its growth rate.  It pointed  to\r\n\r\nthe  need to boost training, promote entrepreneurship and\r\n\r\nfacilitate  new  information technologies and  strengthen\r\n\r\neconomic  fundamentals.   These  are  clear  mantras  for\r\n\r\ngrowth which are easy to spout.  Yet, the reality in  the\r\n\r\neyes  of  many,  New Zealand has failed  to  achieve  the\r\n\r\nresults that it aims for.  This is due to a whole host of\r\n\r\nfactors, which included, among other things, the  country\r\n\r\nbacktracking on its labour reforms.  Over the years,  New\r\n\r\nZealand's economy has receded to such an extent  that  it\r\n\r\ncould  not now even afford to maintain a combat wing  for\r\n\r\nits  air  force.  If you went to New Zealand  today,  you\r\n\r\nwould  not see many signs of physical wealth, which often\r\n\r\nin  Asian  context is measured by the number of  Mercedes\r\n\r\nBenzes on the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore does not have to go the way of New\r\n\r\nZealand.   Unlike  New Zealand, Singapore  has  a  strong\r\n\r\npolitical will to see through the restructuring.  We will\r\n\r\nnot resile from taking politically tough decisions.  Yet,\r\n\r\npolitical  will may not be enough to see us  through  our\r\n\r\npresent  difficulties.  We need to have clearer and  more\r\n\r\ndefined  markers; which brings me now to the point  about\r\n\r\nthe ERC Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While few would deny the logic of the proposals in\r\n\r\nthe ERC Report, one could arguably say that the devil  is\r\n\r\nin  the  detail as to how the Government is going  to  go\r\n\r\nabout  its task.  The present Budget Statement has  given\r\n\r\nus a broad indication of the steps that the Government is\r\n\r\ngoing  to take.  However, it has been said that we should\r\n\r\nperhaps  have a sharper focus.  I have earlier sought  to\r\n\r\ndefine  a  more specific strategy of focusing on branding\r\n\r\nand intellectual knowledge as part of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrategy of building a knowledge economy as a driver  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  future.  More, however, can  be  done.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, we can set clear goals for the next  10  to  15\r\n\r\nyears.   It is not enough just to say that we will remake\r\n\r\nour  economy  and make it a pretty slogan.  We  ought  to\r\n\r\nhave  specific  measurable  performance  indicators,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, looking at how many companies we want to  bring\r\n\r\nglobal.  How many GLCs are going to privatise?  How  many\r\n\r\nstartups we want to nurture, facilitating the growth  and\r\n\r\nexpansion  of such businesses?  This approach  will  give\r\n\r\nthe  exercise a stronger focus, enable us to  offer  more\r\n\r\nassistance  where assistance is needed.  Our strength  is\r\n\r\nin  our  ability to work towards the long term, including\r\n\r\ninvestment, education and training.  There is  no  reason\r\n\r\nwhy the ERC Report cannot aim for such concrete outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us back to the question that we have\r\n\r\nbeen  grappling  with  over the years.   How  far  should\r\n\r\nGovernment  be involved in business?  Leaving  aside  our\r\n\r\nusual  gripes  about the GLCs, I believe  that  there  is\r\n\r\nstill a role for Government in business.  As in the past,\r\n\r\nour  Government should continue to provide leadership  in\r\n\r\nstrategic  areas where the private sector does  not  have\r\n\r\nthe  resources  or  the  ability to  venture  into.   Our\r\n\r\nGovernment should continue to divest its holdings in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, businesses that can be  handled  by  our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.  However, our Government should not cease to\r\n\r\nprovide initiative in other areas where the leadership of\r\n\r\nwhich would help us with the crucial need to successfully\r\n\r\nbuild  up  our second economic wing.  I do hope that,  in\r\n\r\nventuring  abroad, we would have learnt our lessons  from\r\n\r\nthe  past  and avoid making the same mistakes as  before;\r\n\r\nnot  least of which is our Government's habit of  getting\r\n\r\ncivil servants with little or no commercial experience to\r\n\r\ndrive such initiatives.  What I have advocated for  is  a\r\n\r\nslight  departure from the yellow pages rule.  We  should\r\n\r\nnot be afraid of going into businesses that already exist\r\n\r\nlocally.  Rather, we should boldly enter into such  areas\r\n\r\nand  add  value  by creating world-class  companies  with\r\n\r\nworld-class brand names out of opportunities that we are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all my years, I have never seen the mood on\r\n\r\nthe  ground  to be so despairing and despondent.   It  is\r\n\r\ndispiriting for our people to wake up in the morning,  to\r\n\r\nlearn  of  hundreds  of  fellow Singaporeans  being  made\r\n\r\nredundant by the HDB or PSA.  How many more will have  to\r\n\r\nlose  their  jobs  before  our economy  recovers,  if  it\r\n\r\nrecovers?   How  many  more middle-aged  workers  can  we\r\n\r\nemploy  under the present climate?  In this crisis,  what\r\n\r\nshould stand out is our ability to inspire the confidence\r\n\r\nof  our people through our leadership.  We should provide\r\n\r\nour  people with a very clear roadmap on how we are going\r\n\r\nto  navigate  out  of  our  present  structural  economic\r\n\r\nproblems.   Making  broad statements about  what  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do is not going to add any more confidence  to\r\n\r\nthe people.  As I have said before, we should continue to\r\n\r\nprovide sharper focus on our strategies.  For me, I  know\r\n\r\nwhere we should be heading.  I would say once again  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  continue to build a strong external  wing  by\r\n\r\ninvesting  in  or  acquiring world-class  companies  with\r\n\r\nworld-class   brand  names,  and  leveraging   on   these\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  help us build our own global brand  names.\r\n\r\nIf  we  could do that, and do that successfully, we could\r\n\r\nthen  afford  to have some inefficiency in  our  domestic\r\n\r\neconomy  by  subsidising employment for Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  not able to adapt to the employment demands  of  the\r\n\r\nnew world economic order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the comments above, I support the Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  are many who have criticised the Budget for  being\r\n\r\n\"a  non-event\" and \"uninspiring\".  In fact, one  critique\r\n\r\nis  on  the  removal of taxation on interest income  from\r\n\r\nsavings.   One  sarcastic  remark  often  heard  is  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have no money to generate  interest  to  be\r\n\r\ntaxed  now,  given that economic conditions are  so  bad.\r\n\r\nEven for those who have money, interest rates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  so  low that the impact of the relief is negligible.\r\n\r\nSo, why introduce it now?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like many other brickbats, these comments have\r\n\r\nmissed  some  of the more salient benefits  and  measures\r\n\r\nannounced in the Budget which will have a positive impact\r\n\r\non   the  long-term  health  of  the  Singapore  economy.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  do have good reasons to be concerned  about\r\n\r\ntheir  economic  prospects  and  livelihoods,  given  the\r\n\r\nuncertainties  that surround the world  economy  and  the\r\n\r\npolitical environment today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they cannot and should not just leave the\r\n\r\njob  of  reinventing the economy to the  Government,  and\r\n\r\nassuming that the Government will save the day,  or  will\r\n\r\nhand  out something to them should things worsen.   There\r\n\r\nis  a  fundamental  need  in our Singaporean  society  to\r\n\r\nchange  our  mindset to economic and social  matters  and\r\n\r\nindeed  foster  a  greater spirit of self-reliance.   And\r\n\r\nthis is the biggest challenge before us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we band together and change the way we see\r\n\r\nourselves  and  do  business, be more entrepreneurial  in\r\n\r\nmany  aspects, the world is still our oyster.  There  are\r\n\r\ngrounds  to be optimistic and not miss the silver linings\r\n\r\ncontained in the Budget 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Singaporeans cannot just stick their\r\n\r\nheads  in the sand like ostriches, and ignore the reality\r\n\r\nof  the  weak global economic environment confronting  us\r\n\r\ntoday.  We have been in a \"soft spot\" for over two  years\r\n\r\nnow  and,  unlike during the Asian financial crisis  some\r\n\r\nfive  years  ago, the US economy is also  in  bad  shape.\r\n\r\nWith  a structurally weakening US dollar following budget\r\n\r\nand  external deficits in the US, our ability  to  export\r\n\r\nourselves  out of any economic weaknesses may be  further\r\n\r\ncompromised.   In  addition,  our  reliance  on  MNCs  to\r\n\r\nprovide stable manufacturing jobs is fast being eroded by\r\n\r\nthe cheaper competitors like India and China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many respects, Sir, whilst we strive for value-added and highly skilled jobs to move up the value curve\r\n\r\nin job creation, or indeed to fulfill the EDB's vision to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransform Singapore into a \"Global Entrepolis\",  we  have\r\n\r\nto  be very mindful of the fact that Singapore, with  its\r\n\r\nhigh  wage and land costs, will find it harder and harder\r\n\r\nto  continue  to  be relevant economically.   The  Budget\r\n\r\n2003's  proposals  on  putting  off  the  restoration  of\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF contributions, and its lack of incentives\r\n\r\nto  further stimulate demand in the property market,  may\r\n\r\nbe difficult for Singaporeans to understand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some measures which affect the pockets of the man-in-the-street are no doubt painful. They are, however,\r\n\r\ninevitable.   Going  forward, more  radical  measures  to\r\n\r\naddress  these two cost components may still be required.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  we  do not do that, when the next economic  boom\r\n\r\ncomes, Singapore may be left behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen in this light, Sir, to me, the crucial platform\r\n\r\nthat   Budget  2003  has  incorporated  from  the   ERC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations  is its emphasis on entrepreneurship  and\r\n\r\nthe  growth  of  Singapore  companies.   I  am  glad  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  now recognised that we must  reduce  our\r\n\r\nover-reliance    on    MNCs,   and    actively    promote\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,  self-reliance  and  innovation   among\r\n\r\nSingapore companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of my GRC colleague, Mr Raymond Lim,\r\n\r\nto  head the entrepreneurship drive is a testament to the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  commitment to ensure that Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\nbe  lured out of their comfort zones, with incentives and\r\n\r\nsome  prodding on their backs.  I am confident Mr Raymond\r\n\r\nLim  will  do  a good job and have as many of  the  ERC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations   on  entrepreneurship   implemented   as\r\n\r\nquickly  as possible.  However, Sir, I do not  envy  him.\r\n\r\nHe has a difficult task ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I believe that to be successful in\r\n\r\nthis  initiative to boost entrepreneurship, no amount  of\r\n\r\nsafety nets and incentives alone will be enough to  tempt\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  out of their comfort zones.   They  are  so\r\n\r\nused  to  the  tried and tested path of  pursuing  higher\r\n\r\neducation, jobs and stable careers.  There has  to  be  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  overhaul of the different parts of  Singaporean\r\n\r\nsociety, both in mindsets\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  aspirations and, perhaps, a slow and gradual erosion\r\n\r\nof our kiasu and kiasi mentality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taking a leaf from Mr Sim Wong Hoo's Chaotic\r\n\r\nThoughts  from the Old Millennium, Singaporeans,  by  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  suffer  from \"NUTS\" or the \"No U-Turn  Syndrome\".\r\n\r\nHe points out that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In the US, where there is no sign on the road, it\r\n\r\nmeans  that  you can make a U-turn.  When the authorities\r\n\r\ndo  not want people to make U-turns, they put up signs to\r\n\r\ntell  you not to make U-turns.  In Singapore, it  is  the\r\n\r\nreverse.  When there is no sign on the road, you are  not\r\n\r\nallowed to make U-turns.  When the authorities allow  you\r\n\r\nto make U-turns, then they will put up a sign to give you\r\n\r\nthat right.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bottomline is that both systems serve the\r\n\r\nsame  purpose, ie, to better manage traffic.   They  look\r\n\r\nsimilar, but the social repercussion is significant.  The\r\n\r\n\"no  U-turn  syndrome\" has created a way of life  for  us\r\n\r\nthat is based on rules.  And, without rules, Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncannot perform.  They are paralysed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to change our mindset. I fear that\r\n\r\nwhilst  our  budget initiatives to boost entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nare  good, we would not realise the intentions, if  steps\r\n\r\nare  not  taken to also address this mindset  across  all\r\n\r\nSingaporean society.  Civil servants, for instance,  need\r\n\r\nto  be  prepared  to make decisions that  would  be  pro-business and pro-entrepreneurs.  Civil servants must  not\r\n\r\nassume  that the businessmen are out to cheat the  system\r\n\r\nand   exploit  loopholes.   There  is  a   need   for   a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  review  of internal policies  that  stymie\r\n\r\nbusiness  and entrepreneurs, so that the spirit  of  free\r\n\r\nenterprise  can  be  enabled.   I  acknowledge  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisterial Committee on Services and the initiatives  to\r\n\r\nstreamline  rules and regulations are already  in  place.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, more needs to be done at a faster pace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have long pointed out in this House that to\r\n\r\neffectively  change the bureaucracy,  we  would  need  to\r\n\r\nenable  more  cross-overs of private sector talents  into\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service  -  perhaps,  even  as  high  as  the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary level.  After all, if the status  quo\r\n\r\ncontinues,  it  could  be self-perpetuating  and  not  be\r\n\r\nconducive and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsive  to  change.  Those from  the  private  sector\r\n\r\nsurely  would  be  able to bring their perspective,  from\r\n\r\nbeing  on  the  other  side of the  table,  to  good  and\r\n\r\nimmediate  use, rather than trying to get civil  servants\r\n\r\nwith long-standing practices to try to stand in the shoes\r\n\r\nof  the  private  sector - a much more onerous  task.   I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Government seriously look at  employing\r\n\r\nmore private sector talents into key positions within the\r\n\r\ncivil  service,  in the same way that we are  now  seeing\r\n\r\nmore  Ministers  in  Cabinet who  are  from  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also a need for more attention to be\r\n\r\npaid to our younger workers and students in secondary and\r\n\r\ntertiary education.  This generation should not  be  told\r\n\r\nto  achieve  greater academic qualifications  and  skills\r\n\r\nupgrades alone.  It is precisely this motivation that has\r\n\r\nmade many Singaporeans kiasu.  The higher the educational\r\n\r\ncertificate,  or the more paper qualifications  achieved,\r\n\r\nthe  higher the opportunity costs in leaving the  comfort\r\n\r\nzone  from the rule-based path of JC, university,  stable\r\n\r\njob and career growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note the disappointment aired by a recent graduate\r\n\r\nto  the Straits Times' Forum Page last week on not  being\r\n\r\nable   to   land  a  job  after  getting  his  university\r\n\r\nqualifications.  This is in stark contrast to the  winner\r\n\r\nof Her World's Young Woman Entrepreneur Award, Elim Chew,\r\n\r\nwho  graduated  from the school of hard  knocks,  at  the\r\n\r\nlower  end  of  her \"O\" level cohort, and  many  business\r\n\r\nfailures.   Persevering and with drive, she  now  runs  a\r\n\r\nbusiness of more than $10 million turnover per year.   We\r\n\r\nwould  need  to train students to inculcate in  them  the\r\n\r\nmindset  of  risk-taking and self-reliance, so  that  the\r\n\r\nfuture economy in Singapore can be bottom-up, broad-based\r\n\r\nwith depth and breadth of enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take another example of mindset change. It was\r\n\r\nrecently reported that the School of Sports Excellence to\r\n\r\nbe  set  up has a criterion to take in only students  who\r\n\r\nare   from  the  Express  stream.   Why  do  we  restrict\r\n\r\nourselves to this rule?  True,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  of  our top sportsmen have been strong academically\r\n\r\nas well, but there are many more equally successful, such\r\n\r\nas  Fandi  Ahmad and Remy Ong.  Our Asian  Games  bowling\r\n\r\nchampion, Remy Ong, for instance, has even set up his own\r\n\r\nbusiness.   They  are both not from the  Express  stream.\r\n\r\nThere  must  be a sea change in our thinking  across-the-board,  so that flexibility in approach, daring  to  try,\r\n\r\nand risk taking, can permeate throughout our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another measure that many would like to see\r\n\r\nwould be the freeing up of the portion of CPF beyond  the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum, for use as business investment.  There  are\r\n\r\nsome  who  have substantial savings in their CPF.   These\r\n\r\nindividuals are likely to be successful in their  career,\r\n\r\nand have substantial private savings and investments, and\r\n\r\ninsurance  or  pension  plans of  their  own.   Having  a\r\n\r\nsignificant portion of their funds locked up in CPF would\r\n\r\nbe   a   disadvantage,  should  we  want   to   encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship among the more able in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to suggest that perhaps a\r\n\r\nmeans  test, say, for an individual having $X of  private\r\n\r\ninvestment/pension set aside already, be adopted to allow\r\n\r\nfor  the  withdrawal  of  CPF  for  business  investment.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurial  activity should not  be  capped  on  the\r\n\r\nbasic assumption that Singaporeans cannot think and  plan\r\n\r\nfor  themselves, and need to lock up funds in their  CPF.\r\n\r\nSome  can  and should be given the leeway to  expand  the\r\n\r\ndepth of enterprise in our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I speak for many Singaporeans in\r\n\r\nexpressing  our concern about the state of  our  economy.\r\n\r\nTrue,  pump-priming does not work that well in Singapore,\r\n\r\nas  80  cents of a dollar pumped in is leaked out in  our\r\n\r\nhighly open economy.  The conditions in the labour market\r\n\r\nin the private sector are still difficult, with pay cuts,\r\n\r\nwage  freezes and retrenchments seen.  And  this  is  now\r\n\r\nseen in the public sector, such as HDB and PSA Corp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, Sir, it is not all doom and gloom. Many have\r\n\r\nalluded to the problems facing Singapore today as akin to\r\n\r\nJapan after the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwin bubbles in their property and stock markets burst in\r\n\r\n1992.   True,  we  are a smaller nation  and  would  find\r\n\r\nriding  the  rough  tides of economic  ocean  tougher  at\r\n\r\ntimes.  However, in our smaller size lies our flexibility\r\n\r\nto adapt and change.  As long as Singaporeans continue to\r\n\r\npull  together to make the painful sacrifices, our  long-term  economic  future is in good hands.  Indeed,  unlike\r\n\r\nJapan,  it  is  fortunate that Singaporeans  have  chosen\r\n\r\nwisely  to have good continuous stable Government,  which\r\n\r\nis able to implement essential policies for the long-term\r\n\r\ngood  of  Singaporeans, even if it involves some pain  in\r\n\r\nthe  near  term.  We should be proud of that, stand  tall\r\n\r\nagainst the challenges we face, and I am confident  that,\r\n\r\nwith continued good Government in place, we will rise  to\r\n\r\nthe occasion again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement delivered by the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to take part in this Budget debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget contains a clear and unequivocal\r\n\r\nmessage for workers.  There has been a significant  shift\r\n\r\nin  the labour market, and this has vast implications  on\r\n\r\nworkers.  Although manufacturing remains one of  the  two\r\n\r\nkey  engines of our economy, it is no longer the  largest\r\n\r\nprovider  of  jobs.  Most of the jobs are  found  in  the\r\n\r\nservices  sector,  but even this sector  is  not  spared.\r\n\r\nSome  jobs  have  shifted out of the services  sector  to\r\n\r\nlower  cost  locations.   The public  sector,  which  has\r\n\r\nundergone  a lot of changes over the last few  years,  is\r\n\r\nalso  no  longer  a  safe  haven.   In  a  nutshell,  the\r\n\r\nemployment  market has drastically changed,  and  painful\r\n\r\nadjustments have to be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see these changes that are taking place\r\n\r\nand know and understand why they are happening.  Jobs are\r\n\r\nless  permanent  now, and shorter-term, compared  to  the\r\n\r\npast,  and  no one can expect to retire in his first  job\r\n\r\nany more.  But, at the same time, we must also understand\r\n\r\nthat  workers  have  families and commitments  which  are\r\n\r\nregular, permanent and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong-term.   Hence,  they need income stability  and  job\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we ensure that we continue to maintain a\r\n\r\nflexible  job  market but at the same time do  not  cause\r\n\r\nsuch  huge  fluctuations  in our  workers'  lives  as  to\r\n\r\ndestabilise  families and our society?   Can  we  achieve\r\n\r\nthese  twin objectives of a flexible labour market, which\r\n\r\nmeans  that  more of the ups and downs would have  to  be\r\n\r\nborne  by workers, as against their need for balance  and\r\n\r\nstability?\r\n\r\nMs  Chua  Mui Hoong, in her article in the Straits  Times\r\n\r\ndated  8th  March  2003, argued that people  should  stop\r\n\r\nlamenting  about job losses and instead should  focus  on\r\n\r\nhow to manage job shifts.  While I agree with her on this\r\n\r\nand the many other good points which she had made, I am a\r\n\r\nbit  concerned about one point which she had raised.  She\r\n\r\nhad  argued  that the employment relationship  should  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as a purely commercial contract, and one  should\r\n\r\nnot look beyond that.  If we accept this argument, I fear\r\n\r\nthat  one  day,  we will even have to do away  with  core\r\n\r\nlegislation which protects workers' interest and welfare,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Employment Act or the Workmen's Compensation\r\n\r\nAct,  as  the argument would then be that workers  should\r\n\r\ntake  care  of  these  needs through individual  contract\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  Is this a desirable development  from  our\r\n\r\nsociety's  point of view?  I clearly submit  that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot,  as the fact remains that there are inequalities  in\r\n\r\nthe  labour market which cannot be completely removed  by\r\n\r\nadopting  a  strictly commercial approach.   Hence,  some\r\n\r\nform of legislation and system has to be put in place  to\r\n\r\nensure  fairness  and  to balance  the  interest  between\r\n\r\nenterprises and workers.  I would argue, Sir,  that  this\r\n\r\napproach  is good, not only for individuals and families,\r\n\r\nbut  also for the economy and for employers too.  Workers\r\n\r\nwho  are  more  stable  and secure  can  contribute  more\r\n\r\neffectively  and  efficiently  to  the  company  and  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to make one point clear though. I am\r\n\r\nnot   suggesting   that  we  should  become   even   more\r\n\r\nprotectionist.   But  I am arguing  on  the  need  for  a\r\n\r\nbalance.  I also wish to make the point that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  we review and refine the present structure that is in\r\n\r\nplace  in order to achieve labour market flexibility,  we\r\n\r\nalso  need to update and refine the existing system  that\r\n\r\nis in place to protect workers' welfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key refinement that is sorely needed is clearly\r\n\r\nportability of core benefits. Currently, other  than  the\r\n\r\nCPF, the other employment benefits are rigid in two ways.\r\n\r\nThey are mostly tied to workers' present job and are  not\r\n\r\nmovable. Secondly, they also depend on a person's  length\r\n\r\nof  service.   A  case in point is the medical  benefits,\r\n\r\nwhich  are important to workers as healthcare cost  is  a\r\n\r\ngrave  concern  for  many.  But as the  Finance  Minister\r\n\r\ncorrectly pointed out, once a worker moves out of a  job,\r\n\r\nhe  loses  the  benefit.   For  older  workers,  this  is\r\n\r\nparticularly hard as employers do not want to  hire  them\r\n\r\nbecause of concerns over higher medical costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very happy that the Government has\r\n\r\naccepted  the  ERC's recommendation on  portable  medical\r\n\r\nbenefits and decided to raise the tax exemption limit for\r\n\r\nadditional  Medisave  contributions from  private  sector\r\n\r\nemployees  from  1%  of an employee's monthly  salary  at\r\n\r\npresent  to a lump sum of $1,500 per employee  per  year.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir,  I  would like to request that the  Government\r\n\r\nconsider  two refinements.  First, I would  like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government consider providing  incentives  for\r\n\r\nolder  workers to move into the portable medical benefits\r\n\r\nscheme.   This is important, as they would otherwise  not\r\n\r\nfind  the  scheme  attractive  enough,  as  the  portable\r\n\r\nmedical  benefits scheme is essentially a savings  scheme\r\n\r\nand the earlier you come on board the scheme, the better.\r\n\r\nHence,  for older workers, because they have fewer number\r\n\r\nof  years  to work before retirement, they may  find  the\r\n\r\nscheme  less  attractive.  Having any  support  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be  very  helpful  in  terms  of  extra\r\n\r\npremiums or other incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possibility is for the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider providing different\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscales  of  benefits  for tax exemption  for  workers  of\r\n\r\ndifferent age groups. For example, older workers  can  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a  higher  tax  exemption  instead  of  a  blanket\r\n\r\nexemption of $1,500 for everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would also like to ask the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider pegging the additional 1% contribution into  the\r\n\r\nMedisave account to the median wage of our workers.  This\r\n\r\nwould  ensure  that  lower income workers  have  a  basic\r\n\r\nfloor.   Otherwise,  the contribution that  they  receive\r\n\r\nwill  not be meaningful enough to encourage them to adopt\r\n\r\nthe  portable  medical  benefits  scheme  and  would  not\r\n\r\nprovide   effective   protection.    Pegging    the    1%\r\n\r\ncontribution to the median wage is a fair and  reasonable\r\n\r\nsuggestion.   So,  I would like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nseriously consider this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, along the line which I have argued earlier on\r\n\r\nthe need for refinements to our existing system to ensure\r\n\r\na  balance  between  flexibility and  protection,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  we  continue to  strengthen  our  social\r\n\r\nsafety  net.   As the economy restructures and  jobs  are\r\n\r\nshared,  there is a need to ensure that workers get  some\r\n\r\nform of compensation to tide them over their unemployment\r\n\r\nperiod.  While  news  reports are full  of  high  profile\r\n\r\ncases, like the PSA and HDB where some have lamented that\r\n\r\nthe  benefits are generous, there are cases where workers\r\n\r\nare  not  paid when the companies retrench  or  wind  up.\r\n\r\nWhile there is flexibility for employers to shed workers,\r\n\r\nwe also have to ensure that employers exercise this right\r\n\r\nfairly and in a responsible manner.  So, I call upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to monitor the retrenchment situation  closely\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  employers comply  with  the  tripartite\r\n\r\nguidelines  when dealing with excess manpower and  ensure\r\n\r\nthat workers are paid retrenchment benefits when they are\r\n\r\nretrenched.  Under the guidelines, employers are required\r\n\r\nto  consider  implementing a shorter workweek  and  other\r\n\r\nmeasures   for   reducing  costs  before   resorting   to\r\n\r\nretrenchments.   But there is no means of  ensuring  that\r\n\r\nemployees comply with these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two measures which I hope to seek a\r\n\r\nresponse from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne  possibility  of  further  strengthening  our  social\r\n\r\nsafety  net  is the setting up of a fund which  could  be\r\n\r\nused  to pay some benefits to workers who are retrenched.\r\n\r\nI  know that, in the past, this idea had been shot  down.\r\n\r\nIt  had not been well-received but I think there is  some\r\n\r\nneed now for us to rethink about this issue.  A key issue\r\n\r\nhere  is,  of  course, financing.  But I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  also that when a review of the CPF is conducted,\r\n\r\nthe Government could consider setting aside a portion  of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  into  this fund.  Also, instead of  giving  out\r\n\r\nshares or topping up the Medisave, perhaps the Government\r\n\r\ncould consider contributing into this fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not have ready answers on this. But this\r\n\r\nis an issue that we need to discuss and forge a consensus\r\n\r\non how to move ahead.  As the long-term unemployment rate\r\n\r\nwill    remain    high   with   structural   unemployment\r\n\r\ncomplicating the issue, there is clearly a need to engage\r\n\r\nin further discussions on this.  In order to prevent this\r\n\r\nfund  from becoming a disincentive to work, there can  be\r\n\r\nconditions  attached, such as the  maximum  that  can  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn and the need for the retrenched worker to  make\r\n\r\nserious efforts to find a job.  Financing, as I said,  is\r\n\r\na  key  issue, but I am quite confident that  if  we  can\r\n\r\ncontinue to discuss, we may be able to forge a consensus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of foreign workers, Sir, I agree that\r\n\r\nthere  must  be flexibility.  I accept the argument  that\r\n\r\nthere  is no way that the 600,000 foreign workers can  be\r\n\r\nreplaced  by  the 80,000 Singaporeans who are unemployed.\r\n\r\nTo  send  back  even  10% of these foreign  workers  will\r\n\r\nsignificantly  impact on our economy and  cause  loss  of\r\n\r\njobs  among Singaporeans if companies pull out due  to  a\r\n\r\nshortage  of  labour or because of the  lack  of  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.   But at the same time, I feel that there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  for balance and for the Government to monitor  this\r\n\r\nissue more closely.  The quotas were fixed during periods\r\n\r\nwhen  unemployment amongst Singaporeans was  lower.   But\r\n\r\nwith the current high unemployment rate and the projected\r\n\r\nlong-term unemployment rate of up to 5%, these quotas may\r\n\r\nnot be sustainable.  Hence, I call upon the Government to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreview  the foreign worker quota more frequently  and  at\r\n\r\nshorter   intervals,  depending  on  the   economic   and\r\n\r\nemployment situation, to ensure that Singaporeans are not\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a core element of ensuring that there is a\r\n\r\nbalance  between flexibility and protection  is  workers'\r\n\r\ntraining  and skills upgrading.  I strongly  support  the\r\n\r\nformation   of   a  statutory  board  to  undertake   the\r\n\r\nContinuing  Education  and Training  and  job  assistance\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  This is an important milestone in our effort\r\n\r\nto  upgrade workers' skills.  The current measures on job\r\n\r\nassistance  were developed primarily over  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears,  arising  out of the economic downturn.   However,\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment will be a long-term  phenomenon.\r\n\r\nHence,  a more coordinated and more encompassing approach\r\n\r\nis  needed  in  dealing with workers'  training  and  job\r\n\r\nplacement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is certainly a need to establish a closer\r\n\r\nnexus  between training and job placement.  But,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, some flexibility is necessary.  If a  worker\r\n\r\nis  trained only if he can be placed in a job, this would\r\n\r\nalso  act  as  a  disincentive to training.   I  want  to\r\n\r\napplaud the Government for setting aside $500 million for\r\n\r\nthe  Lifelong Learning Fund and another $37  million  for\r\n\r\nskills upgrading efforts.  Singapore's huge investment in\r\n\r\neducation  and  skills  training  is  the  envy  of  many\r\n\r\ncountries.  Many countries aspire to educate and  reskill\r\n\r\ntheir  workers as we do.  Our efforts have been cited  in\r\n\r\nmany  international publications, such as  ILO's  or  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations'  publications, but few  countries  could\r\n\r\ncome  close  to what we have done in terms of  our  heavy\r\n\r\ninvestment in our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real challenge in reskilling our workforce is\r\n\r\nhow  to  ensure that those who really need  the  training\r\n\r\nattend training courses.  Based on anecdotal evidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  Malay community, for instance, my sense is that,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of percentage, the better qualified ones are those\r\n\r\nwho  are more likely to undergo training.  We should have\r\n\r\na   more  in-depth  understanding  and  analysis  of  the\r\n\r\ntraining profile of our workers so that we could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave a more targeted and focused approach in our training\r\n\r\nefforts.   I  hope that the statutory board charged  with\r\n\r\nContinuing Education and Training would be able  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith this issue in a more focused and coordinated way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another aspect of balance which is necessary,\r\n\r\nin  my  view, is to look at how to help employees balance\r\n\r\nwork  and  family.  For years, we  have  been  trying  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  birthrate.  But we have made  very  little\r\n\r\nprogress.  Last year, despite all the incentives given to\r\n\r\nfamilies  to  have  more  children,  we  had  the  lowest\r\n\r\nbirthrate in 14 years.  The underlying reason is  clearly\r\n\r\nthe  inability of many dual-income families to cope  with\r\n\r\nthe  increasing demands of work and family.   Many  women\r\n\r\ntoday  work  not  for  aesthetic  reasons  or  for  self-fulfillment  but  because they have to.   Women's  income\r\n\r\nconstitutes a significant percentage of the total  family\r\n\r\nincome.   Many  companies have found that  helping  their\r\n\r\nemployees  balance  work  and family  means  greater  job\r\n\r\nsatisfaction, less turnover and higher productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I call upon the Government, Sir, to give a\r\n\r\nstronger  push to initiatives to promote work and  family\r\n\r\nbalance.   As the issues affecting the family  is  multi-faceted,  it  may  be  timely to consider  setting  up  a\r\n\r\nNational  Family  Council, akin  to  the  National  Youth\r\n\r\nCouncil,  to take care of all matters pertaining  to  the\r\n\r\nfamily.   The  National Family Council  can  act  as  the\r\n\r\ncoordinating  body, as well as the body to  champion  all\r\n\r\nmatters pertaining to family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to request the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider increasing the subsidy for parents who put their\r\n\r\nchildren  in childcare centres.  The last time  that  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy  was  increased was some years ago  when  it  was\r\n\r\nfixed  at $150. Since then, childcare fees have  gone  up\r\n\r\nbut the subsidy has not been reviewed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I also call upon the Government to\r\n\r\npay  special  attention to the plight of  older  workers.\r\n\r\nAgeism  is  alive  and  well and  employers  continue  to\r\n\r\ndiscriminate against older workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho are considered unproductive, slower and not adaptable\r\n\r\nor trainable. Such stereotypes are not only demeaning but\r\n\r\nalso  untrue.   I  have met many older  workers  who  are\r\n\r\nunhappy  that despite the efforts to upgrade  and  change\r\n\r\nmindsets,  employers  continue  to  discriminate  against\r\n\r\nthem.  We  need to highlight and recognise best practices\r\n\r\namong  employers.  The Ministry of Manpower  can  perhaps\r\n\r\nwork  out a scheme to recognise efforts of employers  who\r\n\r\nhave successfully integrated their older workers in their\r\n\r\nworkforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the public sector. I must\r\n\r\nsay  that  there are a lot of anxieties when  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  mentioned  that there would  be  a  review  of\r\n\r\npublic   sector's  services  with  the   possibility   of\r\n\r\nprivatising some of these services. There are two  points\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would  like to make.  First, in line  with  our\r\n\r\nstrong  tripartite tradition, I would like  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  Ministries and statutory boards to consult  and\r\n\r\ninvolve the unions before restructurings are carried out,\r\n\r\nso  that  workers'  concerns can  be  addressed  and  the\r\n\r\nrestructurings  can  be properly carried  out.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  I  must commend the HDB management for involving\r\n\r\nthe  union and the extensive consultations that they  had\r\n\r\nwith the union and the workers before the restructuring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, managing change effectively is critical to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we do not end up with a demoralised  public\r\n\r\nsector  and to ensure that the outcomes which are desired\r\n\r\nare  actually  achieved. Secondly, Sir, I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  put in place a system  to  monitor  the\r\n\r\nquality  and  delivery of the services  which  have  been\r\n\r\nhived  off  or may be hived off to the private sector  to\r\n\r\nensure that the same level of quality in good service  is\r\n\r\nmaintained.  A key reason why there is strong  opposition\r\n\r\nto  privatisation  of  public  sector  services  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries  is  because after privatisation,  people  find\r\n\r\nthat  the  cost  of the services either went  up  or  the\r\n\r\nquality  was  affected.  Hence, we need  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nwhilst the objective of outsourcing services that can now\r\n\r\nbe provided by the public sector to the private sector is\r\n\r\ncost,  this  should not result in a lower or more  costly\r\n\r\nservice\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Mr Leong Horn Kee that there are\r\n\r\nconcerns  among  the  older workers,  whether  they  have\r\n\r\nenough  savings  in  their CPF.  I  also  agree  with  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh  that there is a need to further  promote\r\n\r\nthe  monthly variable component.  I strongly support  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister's call that employers should  pass\r\n\r\non  part of the cost-savings to deserving workers through\r\n\r\nthe variable component of wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During these difficult times, it is important that\r\n\r\nwe  continue  to  maintain the trust  and  confidence  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  If companies that are still doing well  do  not\r\n\r\nreward  workers,  or try to exploit the current  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  then I am afraid that irreparable damage  will\r\n\r\nbe done, and people will be less willing to accept change\r\n\r\nor  to  make sacrifices.  It is also important that while\r\n\r\nwe  ask  workers to tighten their belts and accept  harsh\r\n\r\nmeasures  for their own future, the Government  continues\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the cost of living does not escalate.  If\r\n\r\nwages  do not increase, or the pace of increase  is  very\r\n\r\nmoderate,  but  healthcare, housing, transport  or  other\r\n\r\ncost  increase, then this would cause hardship and affect\r\n\r\nworkers'  standard of living.  Hence, I urge all  service\r\n\r\nproviders,  whether public or private, to  heed  people's\r\n\r\nanxieties   and  concerns  and  do  not  indiscriminately\r\n\r\nincrease their charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also call upon the Government to continue to\r\n\r\nmonitor  the situation of low income Singaporeans.   This\r\n\r\nis  to ensure that they receive the assistance that  they\r\n\r\nneed.   There are help schemes that are already in  place\r\n\r\nbut we need to review these schemes from time to time, to\r\n\r\nensure that they are adequate and are accessible to those\r\n\r\nwho are really in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, how would I describe this year's\r\n\r\nBudget?   To me, this year's Budget can be summed  up  in\r\n\r\nthree words - pro-growth, pro-job and pro-workers.   This\r\n\r\nis  not  an  assessment that everyone would  agree  with.\r\n\r\nSome  had  said  that  this is a  pro-business  and  pro-employer  Budget.   They pointed to the  many  incentives\r\n\r\ngiven  to  businesses, compared to some  of  the  painful\r\n\r\nmeasures for workers.  So, as a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunionist,  why  am  I arguing that this  Budget  is  pro-worker?   Mr  Speaker, Sir, this is because  we,  in  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement,  understand  the  realities  down   the\r\n\r\nground.   Ask any worker today and he will tell you  that\r\n\r\nhis  major  concern is about employment.  Those  who  are\r\n\r\nemployed  are  worried that they will  lose  their  jobs.\r\n\r\nThose  without jobs are worried about how fast they would\r\n\r\nsecure  another one.  After the retrenchments in PSA  and\r\n\r\nthe  restructuring in HDB, many wait anxiously and  watch\r\n\r\nout  for  signs that will tell them whether their company\r\n\r\nis  next on the line.  There is an air of uncertainty and\r\n\r\ngeneral anxiety in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having spent more than two decades in the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement,  I  must say  that  this  is  the  most\r\n\r\nchallenging period that I have experienced.   In  such  a\r\n\r\nclimate, any measures that will help to preserve jobs  or\r\n\r\nto  delay retrenchments are welcomed.  Any measures  that\r\n\r\ntell us how new investments will be drawn in and new jobs\r\n\r\ncreated  are  welcomed.  Will the measures  announced  in\r\n\r\nthis  Budget  guarantee that no jobs are lost?   Will  it\r\n\r\nguarantee  that new jobs will be created to soak  up  new\r\n\r\nentrants  to the labour market and the retrenched?   Will\r\n\r\nit  guarantee  that  older workers will  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nemployed?   The  reality is that  no  one  can  guarantee\r\n\r\nanything, as there are just too many imponderables.   But\r\n\r\nthen we, in the labour movement, ask ourselves whether we\r\n\r\nwould  be worse off or better off without these measures.\r\n\r\nSir,  if we stick steadfastly to old paradigms and rules,\r\n\r\nwill  it help the workers or make their situation  worse?\r\n\r\nHow  should we champion and articulate workers' interest?\r\n\r\nDoes  championing workers' interest mean that we have  to\r\n\r\ntake the popular line and shout slogans or do we adopt  a\r\n\r\nmore responsible attitude, analyse issues, think out  the\r\n\r\nstrategies  and  work  out the  programmes  to  help  our\r\n\r\nworkers?  We in the labour movement have decided  to  cut\r\n\r\nthe rhetoric, roll up our sleeves and get down to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's progress is in no small measure due to\r\n\r\nthis  responsible part that we have played in  protecting\r\n\r\nworkers' interest.  After much soul searching, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagree  that, difficult though some of these ERC  measures\r\n\r\nmay be, they are necessary for the short-term as well  as\r\n\r\nto  protect the long-term interest of workers.  At  least\r\n\r\nwith  these  measures we now stand more than  a  fighting\r\n\r\nchance  to make a break and to recover strongly.   If  we\r\n\r\nhad stuck to our guns, we may not even have that fighting\r\n\r\nchance.  Take the case of the 2-year CPF deferment.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  must  tell  you  that there was also  a  lot  of  soul\r\n\r\nsearching on our part.  Some would have preferred to wait\r\n\r\nand  have it assessed on a yearly basis.  But at the  end\r\n\r\nof  the  day, many of us are persuaded that  we  are  not\r\n\r\ndealing  with normal times.  We are dealing with  unusual\r\n\r\ntimes.   And  unusual  times  require  unusual  measures,\r\n\r\nunusual ways of doing things and unusual sacrifices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are so many threats and challenges that\r\n\r\nSingapore is faced with.  It is as if our entire  resolve\r\n\r\nas  a  nation is being tested.  I must say that  we  have\r\n\r\nkept  the flag flying high.  It has not been easy to  get\r\n\r\npeople  to  think  and see the long-term.   Sometimes,  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  there is a perennial disconnect between  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's long-term plans and visions and  desire  for\r\n\r\npeople to think long-term and people's concern over their\r\n\r\nshort-term needs.  The challenge for Singapore really  is\r\n\r\nhow  to  bridge this perception gap so that we have  more\r\n\r\npeople  thinking on the same wave-length.  At the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  day, Sir, what will hold us together as a people and\r\n\r\nenable  us to overcome these huge challenges that we  are\r\n\r\nnow  faced  with is the trust and confidence that  people\r\n\r\nhave in the Government.  This trust and confidence is not\r\n\r\nsomething that is developed by chance or that came  about\r\n\r\novernight.    It   arose  because  the   Government   has\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  kept faith with the people and  delivered  on\r\n\r\nits  promises.  I am confident that a new partnership  is\r\n\r\nnow  developing  between the Government and  the  people.\r\n\r\nTrust and confidence is still a key consideration, but in\r\n\r\nthis  new  partnership it also requires greater ownership\r\n\r\nand responsibility on the part of all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.08 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am happy to note that the Finance Minister in his 2003\r\n\r\nBudget has taken into account many of the points made  by\r\n\r\nthe  ERC and its various sub-committees.  The ERC  Report\r\n\r\nhighlights the problems Singapore faces in the transition\r\n\r\ntowards   a   full-fledged  first  world  economy.    Its\r\n\r\nrecommendations will serve us well in the  future  as  we\r\n\r\nstrive  to  find our place in the new knowledge  era.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to congratulate members of the ERC and its sub-committees for a job well done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current gloomy scenario is a good time to take\r\n\r\nstock, consolidate and plan for the future.  However,  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  confuse ourselves between the effects  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  downturn  and the effects of  long-term  change,\r\n\r\nwhich  is brought about by globalisation, the new economy\r\n\r\nand   Singapore's  progress  into  the  premier  economic\r\n\r\nleague.  The ERC should be commended for addressing  both\r\n\r\nthe  short-term and long-term problems.  Today,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to   comment   on   the  issues   of   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and helping dislocated  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nremain employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on competitiveness. I believe that\r\n\r\nGovernment  can and should help Singapore businesses,  be\r\n\r\nthey  domestic  or international, to be competitive.   We\r\n\r\ncan  do  it  by  taking the Singapore Inc  approach.   By\r\n\r\n\"Singapore   Inc\",  I  mean  Government  and   businesses\r\n\r\nconsider  each other as partners to promote a flourishing\r\n\r\neconomy.   There is greater urgency for this  now  as  we\r\n\r\ncompete   as   a  nation  in  a  globalised  environment.\r\n\r\nGovernment   agencies  must  therefore   seek   ways   to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  businesses and encourage entrepreneurship  by\r\n\r\nremoving obstacles and help the implementation of new and\r\n\r\nnovel ideas.  This will require a new mindset on the part\r\n\r\nof  the Government, in that the Government, together with\r\n\r\ncivil  servants must stand on the side of  businesses  to\r\n\r\nhelp them survive and prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that Minister of State, Raymond Lim, has\r\n\r\nrecognised the need\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  this  new  mindset  in his speech  earlier,  and  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh has also spoken on this.  It is not unlike\r\n\r\nthe  role  of EDB helping MNCs to set up their businesses\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Likewise, SPRING Singapore, and indeed all\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies should go all out to help businesses\r\n\r\nin  their  thoughts and actions, be more market-friendly,\r\n\r\nand  when an application goes against existing rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations,  find  ways  to  justify  the  applications,\r\n\r\nwithout making the rules meaningless.  Let me give one or\r\n\r\ntwo simple real-life examples to illustrate my point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grassroots leader of mine operates an eating house\r\n\r\nalong Race Course Lane in the central area.  The property\r\n\r\nnext  to  his has an extension jutting out from the  main\r\n\r\nfacade.  As a good businessman, my grassroots leader  put\r\n\r\nup  his  eating house sign above his gate away  from  his\r\n\r\nfacade, but in line with his next door extension, so that\r\n\r\nthe  visibility  of the sign would not be obstructed  and\r\n\r\nhis  business would not be affected.  Lo and  behold,  he\r\n\r\nwas  asked  to  remove the sign by the authority  because\r\n\r\nadvertisement rules in the central area require the  sign\r\n\r\nto  be flushed with the property facade.  He appealed but\r\n\r\nwas  rejected.   I  found  this  unacceptable  and  so  I\r\n\r\nappealed on his behalf to the Minister, arguing  that  if\r\n\r\nthe next door extension had been allowed, and had already\r\n\r\nchanged the facade of the original row of properties, why\r\n\r\nshould  the  authority insist that the eating house  sign\r\n\r\nmust  be  flushed with its own facade?  Fortunately,  the\r\n\r\nMinister agreed and the appeal was granted.  But what  if\r\n\r\nI  had  not  appealed?  The problem should therefore  not\r\n\r\nhave  remained unresolved in the first place.  This  will\r\n\r\nbe  the  case if the relevant Government officer believes\r\n\r\nthat he also has a duty to assist businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members another example. A construction\r\n\r\ncompany  recently bought over a cement plant  to  produce\r\n\r\ncement  for  its  own use.  One way to  make  its  cement\r\n\r\ncompetitive compared to imported cement is to  lower  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  importing the raw material.  The company  found\r\n\r\nthat  if it is allowed to unload the raw material at  the\r\n\r\nexisting Government jetty, which is being used now for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunloading  of sand and granite, it can save substantially\r\n\r\non  import cost, as opposed to unloading the material  at\r\n\r\nJurong Port.  The company applied for permission to do it\r\n\r\non the grounds that the physical form of the raw material\r\n\r\nto  be  imported  is  similar to sand  and  granite.   In\r\n\r\naddition, if the cement plant survives, it will  continue\r\n\r\nto  provide  jobs  and  utilise a substantial  amount  of\r\n\r\nelectric  power.   The authority, however,  rejected  its\r\n\r\napplication.  One official actually told the company that\r\n\r\nit  should just import the cement instead of producing it\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sim Wong Hoo, therefore, hit the nail on its head\r\n\r\nwhen,  according to his book \"Chaotic Thoughts  From  The\r\n\r\nOld  Millennium\",  he told his customer service  officers\r\n\r\nthat  they were in fact the customers' advocates and they\r\n\r\nhad to be fighting with him for their customers' interest\r\n\r\nrather  than  the  other  way  round.   I  believe  civil\r\n\r\nservants must adopt the same attitude.  They must realise\r\n\r\nthat  they work for Singapore, as part of Singapore  Inc,\r\n\r\nand  that  the businesses which they deal with are  their\r\n\r\nallies,  as well as their customers, and not an adversary\r\n\r\nto  be  challenged at every opportunity.  It is  commonly\r\n\r\nperceived  that  when a civil servant is  faced  with  an\r\n\r\napplication for a new business activity, which  does  not\r\n\r\nconform  with  some  existing rule  or  policy,  his  gut\r\n\r\nreaction will be to simply reject the application.   This\r\n\r\nis what Minister of State Raymond Lim earlier referred to\r\n\r\nas  the default \"No\" button.  The civil servant will,  at\r\n\r\nbest,  and  in  line  with our campaign  for  a  gracious\r\n\r\nsociety,  find a nice way to write the rejection  letter.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it  does not solve the problem of the  business\r\n\r\napplicant  and, worse, if the applicant has come  with  a\r\n\r\nbrilliant,   revolutionary   idea   which   can   benefit\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what should civil servants do? First and\r\n\r\nforemost, if it has not already happened, the attitude of\r\n\r\njust following the rules has got to change.  Yes, we must\r\n\r\nfollow rules, regulations, policies and guidelines.  They\r\n\r\nare  needed  for good order.  However, they must  not  be\r\n\r\nobeyed blindly.  When an application from a business with\r\n\r\na  new  idea comes along, civil servants ought to try  to\r\n\r\nhelp it obtain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  approvals  it  needs.  In the new  economy,  and  if\r\n\r\nSingapore is to remain competitive, that should be  their\r\n\r\nduty.   This  is  how  they  can become  the  \"customer's\r\n\r\nadvocates\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the application cannot be approved due to some\r\n\r\nrule  or  policy,  the  civil servants  should  help  the\r\n\r\napplicant find a way around the problem.  If the case  is\r\n\r\ngood  enough  and is beyond his authority to approve,  he\r\n\r\nshould  bring it up to his bosses.  He should never  wait\r\n\r\nfor  the applicant, who is his customer, to appeal to the\r\n\r\n\"higher  authorities\".   Being the  advocate,  he  should\r\n\r\ninitiate the appeal on his \"customer's\" behalf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in our civil service system, his immediate\r\n\r\nsuperior  should  welcome  such  initiative  instead   of\r\n\r\nfinding  it  bothersome.  Indeed, the immediate  superior\r\n\r\nshould  now,  in turn, become the customer's advocate  to\r\n\r\nhelp   the   applicant  obtain  his   approval.    If   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  decision still cannot be made,  the  matter\r\n\r\nshould  progress further up the civil service  hierarchy.\r\n\r\nAs  far as possible, it should not be a matter that needs\r\n\r\nto  be  brought  up at a meet-the-people session  and  be\r\n\r\nresolved by MPs writing to the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, all avenues can be explored before\r\n\r\nturning down business applications with sufficiently good\r\n\r\nideas.   New ideas do not come about easily.  Surely,  we\r\n\r\nmust give them due consideration before tossing them into\r\n\r\nthe bin, just because of some old rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such due process is given before rejecting\r\n\r\napplications,   the  entrepreneur  will   at   least   be\r\n\r\nencouraged by the experience.  He will be willing to  try\r\n\r\nagain  in  future because he can see that the  Government\r\n\r\nand  civil  servants  are on his side,  and  not  another\r\n\r\nobstacle to be surmounted.  Mr Speaker, Sir, this is  one\r\n\r\nway we can encourage more entrepreneurship in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important issue affecting competitiveness is\r\n\r\nland.   Members have spoken about it.  Land  cost  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfactor  of  production.   I am  glad  that  the  ERC  has\r\n\r\nrecommended  that our industrial and commercial  land  be\r\n\r\npriced  competitively in relation with competing nations.\r\n\r\nIn  order  to  achieve this, land should  not  be  priced\r\n\r\naccording to alternative use but in accordance  with  its\r\n\r\ndirect  industry use.  Being the largest land owner,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can exert a great influence over land cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is a need to lower land cost generally,\r\n\r\nI  understand  that  there is also a  dilemma.   If  land\r\n\r\nprices  fall  too drastically, existing land  owners  and\r\n\r\nlessees  will be hard hit.  Our financial system  may  be\r\n\r\naffected  thus  worsening  our already  fragile  economy.\r\n\r\nHowever,  while caution is prudent, I urge the Government\r\n\r\nnot  to \"do nothing\" or too little since land cost is one\r\n\r\nmajor factor affecting our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two measures announced by DPM during his Budget 2003\r\n\r\nspeech  are for a property tax rebate and rental rebates.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these measures are only for six months.  I\r\n\r\nfind  this too cautious and feel that we can be far  more\r\n\r\ngenerous.  Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has justified that the freeze in the restoration\r\n\r\nof  the  employer's CPF contribution rates for a  further\r\n\r\ntwo years is to give certainty to the employers, MNCs and\r\n\r\ninvestors about the CPF issue.  It is intended to send  a\r\n\r\nstrong signal that we are serious in solving our problems\r\n\r\nand  that  we  are determined to keep our  business  cost\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  This is the sacrifice our workers are asked\r\n\r\nto  make.  But when it comes to Government rebates, I  am\r\n\r\npuzzled that the Government is only prepared to give  six\r\n\r\nmonths.   Should not the Government also  make  the  same\r\n\r\ncommitment of two years on land and other costs and  send\r\n\r\nan equally strong signal to investors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rebate and the extension of rental\r\n\r\nrebates,  together with the reduction of  foreign  worker\r\n\r\nlevy  and the reduction  of diesel tax, etc, should  also\r\n\r\nbe  given over a period of the same two years, instead of\r\n\r\nonly  six  months.  This will certainly send  an  equally\r\n\r\nstrong signal to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  workers.   Yes,  with the war looming  and  economic\r\n\r\nuncertainties  reaching an unprecedented height,  perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should be even bolder and  increase  the\r\n\r\nquantum of the property tax and rental rebates given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer period of two years is not as \"reckless\"\r\n\r\nas  it  seems.   If the economy recovers, the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  have  more tax income and can well afford  it.   If\r\n\r\nnot,  then  these  rebates  and reduction  are  certainly\r\n\r\nneeded to lower business cost.  Heads, we win; tails,  we\r\n\r\nalso win  -  what could be better?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another threat we face is the hollowing out of some\r\n\r\nof  our  industries and the loss of jobs.   The  ERC  has\r\n\r\nreported   that  we  have  sufficient  industrial   land.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  should  start to  consider  pricing  land\r\n\r\naccording  to industry use to hold on to even the  lower-tech  industries  through competitive  land  prices,  and\r\n\r\ndissuade  them from migrating to low cost countries.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to do this in order to provide continued employment\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans who find it difficult to re-skill.   It\r\n\r\nis better to do this than to give them social assistance.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  in order to limit any undesirable effects,  this\r\n\r\nmeasure  can  be  strictly targeted.   We  can  start  by\r\n\r\nputting  aside only a small portion of our JTC land  bank\r\n\r\nfor  this purpose.  This is better than leaving our  land\r\n\r\nvacant when these lower-tech companies migrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, capital is another important factor. I agree\r\n\r\nwith the Government on various measures to encourage  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  keep  their capital or  money  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nLower  direct  taxes will allow for capital regeneration.\r\n\r\nThe stable Singapore dollar policy is also beneficial  to\r\n\r\ncapital   inflows.   Elimination  of  taxes  on   profits\r\n\r\nrepatriated   from  abroad  will  also   encourage   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to bring back much needed money  from  their\r\n\r\noverseas  operations and help lift the domestic  economy.\r\n\r\nAbolishing  taxes  on interest earned  from  deposits  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will also encourage money to remain here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital allowances for all capital items will\r\n\r\nalso be beneficial to encourage risk-taking.  I also urge\r\n\r\nthe Government to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallow   losses   from  an  overseas  subsidiary   to   be\r\n\r\nconsolidated  at  the group level for taxation  purposes.\r\n\r\nThis  measure will encourage our companies to go overseas\r\n\r\nand globalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some concern of abuse. However, the\r\n\r\nGovernment is already aware of this possibility and I  am\r\n\r\nsure  appropriate measures, like capping the  quantum  of\r\n\r\nlosses  allowable for group tax relief, or a registration\r\n\r\nor monitoring system, can be instituted to prevent this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new knowledge economy will throw up one\r\n\r\nundesirable  effect, ie, structural unemployment.   There\r\n\r\nwill be workers who will find it too difficult to retrain\r\n\r\nand  reskill,  either due to their age or other  factors.\r\n\r\nAs  a modern society, we must provide some assistance  to\r\n\r\nsuch  people,  not only in the form of  a  pure  monetary\r\n\r\nhandout,  but  also meaningful work so that  their  self-esteem  does  not  suffer.   My  earlier  suggestion   on\r\n\r\nreserving some cheap land for lower-tech industries  will\r\n\r\nhelp.  However, more can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Members will agree that financial help\r\n\r\nwhich is tied to the performance of some meaningful  work\r\n\r\nis far superior to a pure handout, like ERS shares.  Such\r\n\r\nwork  schemes may be difficult to implement  due  to  the\r\n\r\nconcern  that  some  unscrupulous people  may  abuse  it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  we should not be swayed  from  the  higher\r\n\r\nintent   and   should   find  ways  to   overcome   these\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good idea to counter structural unemployment\r\n\r\nby  using  the  concept of \"negative income  tax\".   This\r\n\r\nmeasure  is  better, more meaningful and  more  effective\r\n\r\nthan  the \"handouts\" given since the negative income  tax\r\n\r\nis  associated with job creation.  The Government already\r\n\r\nprovides    subsidies    for   various    training    and\r\n\r\napprenticeship schemes.  In general, this can be  further\r\n\r\nextended   more  widely  and  for  longer   periods,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older workers, I would like to urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  consider subsidising part  of  their  CPF\r\n\r\npayments,  instead of simply instituting  a  cut  in  the\r\n\r\ncontribution rates. This achieves the intention of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlowering  costs for employers and will also  protect  the\r\n\r\nworkers' retirement nest-egg from shrinkage.  The  amount\r\n\r\nof Government expenditure needed is small compared to the\r\n\r\ntotal expenditure.  The money spent here is better spent,\r\n\r\nmore  targeted, than simply handing out shares  or  money\r\n\r\nacross the board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I would like the Government to consider\r\n\r\ninstituting  a  \"paid\" community or social  work  scheme.\r\n\r\nThe  benefits of this are two-fold:  the old, chronically\r\n\r\nsick,  underprivileged and the community will  gain  from\r\n\r\nthe  services provided and improve their quality of life;\r\n\r\nand  the longer-term unemployed will find some meaningful\r\n\r\nwork  to  do  for  some  pocket  money.   The  newspapers\r\n\r\nreported that one Town Council is already doing this in a\r\n\r\nlimited way by \"employing\" those out of work to do checks\r\n\r\nand  inspections on common facilities so  that  a  better\r\n\r\nlevel of maintenance can be achieved.  The Government can\r\n\r\nprovide  some  money  for this and other  schemes  to  be\r\n\r\ninstituted  and  expanded.  These can  include  a  social\r\n\r\nvisitor scheme for the old and the sick who are alone  at\r\n\r\nhome, or schemes such as neighbourhood watch, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the social visitor scheme, our unemployed can be\r\n\r\ntrained  to  provide visits to the old, infirm  or  sick.\r\n\r\nThese are the underprivileged who would normally be  left\r\n\r\nalone  at  home, unable to move around easily,  and  need\r\n\r\nhelp with simple errands or maybe simply a friend to talk\r\n\r\nto.   We  can certainly improve the quality of  life  for\r\n\r\nsuch  unfortunate people by taking care  of  their  basic\r\n\r\nneeds and, at the same time, provide some useful work for\r\n\r\nthose that are unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the neighbourhood watch scheme, an allowance can\r\n\r\nbe  paid  to  those  who need a job  for  their  role  in\r\n\r\nproviding  some neighbourhood watch service.  This  could\r\n\r\ninclude  neighbourhood patrols or even simply  stationing\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  key  areas to deter petty  criminals  and\r\n\r\nother offenders.  In difficult  times like this, there is\r\n\r\na tendency for such crimes to increase and this will be a\r\n\r\ngood counter measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to close with a comment\r\n\r\non  the  budget deficit.  I do realise that  some  of  my\r\n\r\nearlier  recommendations need  to  be  funded.   DPM  has\r\n\r\nalready taken pains to point out that the FY 2003  Budget\r\n\r\nwill  be  the third consecutive year of budget  deficits.\r\n\r\nHowever,  many have fed back that the Budget  could  have\r\n\r\nbeen  more  generous.   The  projected  deficit  is  $900\r\n\r\nmillion.   But during better years, we achieved surpluses\r\n\r\nof  around  $4-$5 billion a year.  Why can the Government\r\n\r\nnot contemplate a deficit nearer such a level in what  is\r\n\r\nnotably  a  very trying and uncertain time?  The  war  on\r\n\r\nIraq  seems inevitable.  It may happen within days.   The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has advised Singaporeans to expect tougher\r\n\r\ntimes  ahead in the next few months.  The outcome of  the\r\n\r\nwar  is  an  unknown.  What if it is an unfavourable  one\r\n\r\naffecting   adversely   the   political   and    economic\r\n\r\nenvironment  of the world over a longer period  of  time?\r\n\r\nDo  we  have the assurance of the Government to introduce\r\n\r\nanother   off-Budget   package  of   measures   to   help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of what I have said, I support the\r\n\r\nBudget.    However,  I  hope  that  DPM  will  give   due\r\n\r\nconsideration to my suggestions.  And I hope he will also\r\n\r\ngive  a commitment to provide further generous off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures  to give the economy a much needed boost  should\r\n\r\nthe worst in the Iraq crisis come about.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  have heard many say that  this  year's\r\n\r\nBudget  is  a non-event.  Personally, I am glad  to  note\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  has  attempted  to  create   more\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  a  level  playing  field   for   all,\r\n\r\nparticularly in promoting entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just wish to make two observations. Firstly,\r\n\r\nthere  is  obviously  a  more  deliberate  move  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to encourage self-help and make  life  easier\r\n\r\nfor  the  entrepreneurs.  This is encouraging.   However,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  enjoyed  many  good  years  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been  playing  the  role  of  giver  and\r\n\r\nprovider.   Most people are used to this.  In bad  times,\r\n\r\nsuch as now, I notice the emergence of two categories  of\r\n\r\npeople,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neach  with  different expectations.  The  first  category\r\n\r\nconsists  of  those who are not willing  to  lower  their\r\n\r\nexpectations  in  salary  or in  status  when  they  seek\r\n\r\nemployment.   I  have witnessed this when  I  interviewed\r\n\r\napplicants  for  jobs in my company, and the  problem  is\r\n\r\nreal.  These people have been retrenched and yet they are\r\n\r\nnot  willing to forgo their level of material comfort and\r\n\r\nstatus when they seek new employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other category consists of those who are willing\r\n\r\nto  have a go and wish it on their own but they lack  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  on  how  to  make a  headstart.   It  is  this\r\n\r\ncategory of people that we must place more focus  on.   I\r\n\r\nnotice that many are still unaware of the incentives  and\r\n\r\nopportunities that the Government had instituted over the\r\n\r\nyears.    This   could  be  due  to  a  lack   of   clear\r\n\r\ncommunication between the Government, the people and  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  communities, especially the SMEs.  As  what  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh said earlier, many GLCs are already  well\r\n\r\naware  of  the  incentives  and opportunities  available.\r\n\r\nHowever,  many SMEs are not that well connected and  most\r\n\r\nare not familiar with Government policies.  Some are also\r\n\r\nconfused by the policy changes over the years.  I propose\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  play  a  more  active   role   in\r\n\r\ncommunicating with the general public and especially  the\r\n\r\nSMEs,  through more regular dialogue sessions.  Different\r\n\r\nMinistries could hold separate dialogue sessions to  make\r\n\r\nclear the opportunities that are available.  Availability\r\n\r\nof   opportunities  is  always  the  gateway  sought   by\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.   Throughout  my  life,  I   have   sought\r\n\r\nopportunities  rather  than  handouts.   Since  the  late\r\n\r\nseventies  when  I  first  arrived  here,  Singapore  has\r\n\r\noffered  me many opportunities to make it on my own,  and\r\n\r\nfor this I am grateful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that we moved on and adopted measures\r\n\r\nthat  are  sustainable in the long term and  create  more\r\n\r\nopportunities  for individuals who are  willing  to  take\r\n\r\nrisks  and make it on their own.  Government should  play\r\n\r\nstrong   leadership  in  providing  opportunities.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  Mrs Yu-Foo has recently proposed an  initiative\r\n\r\nto  allow  residents who are unemployed to  showcase  and\r\n\r\nsell their homemade products.  The start-up cost for such\r\n\r\ninitiative\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis very low as participants pay very low rent.  This will\r\n\r\nallow people to be proud of self help.  I was also taught\r\n\r\nwhen  I was young to be independent, instead of depending\r\n\r\non handouts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example. The Government, being such a big\r\n\r\nbuyer,  and the Ministries and agencies can be more  open\r\n\r\nto  new ideas and new innovations.  And this leads me  to\r\n\r\ntouch on a second issue.  I feel that there is a need for\r\n\r\nconstant   review   of   the   Government's   rules   and\r\n\r\nregulations, in line with changing times.  I am glad that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  adopted the  ERC's  recommendations\r\n\r\npertaining to this.  However, this calls for a change  in\r\n\r\nmindset  amongst officers at every level  of  the  public\r\n\r\nsector.   My experience is that most officers in the  top\r\n\r\nmanagement of the various Ministries and statutory boards\r\n\r\nare  willing to make changes.  However, this is often not\r\n\r\nso for lower rank officers.  Most are not willing to take\r\n\r\non  the added responsibility of making a change, even  if\r\n\r\nit is a change for the better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As most officers are happy to religiously follow set\r\n\r\nrules, initiative from the top management is often needed\r\n\r\nto  institute changes in the rules and regulations.  This\r\n\r\nis  unfortunate  as the frontline officers  and  officers\r\n\r\nfrom  the middle management are often the ones in  direct\r\n\r\ncontact  with the public.  They are aware of the problems\r\n\r\ncreated by some rules and regulations and they are in the\r\n\r\nbest position to recommend and facilitate changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective, perhaps each Ministry should set up\r\n\r\nits  own  Rules  Review Committee, apart from  the  Rules\r\n\r\nReview  Panel  proposed.   The Committee  should  include\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from both the public and private sectors.\r\n\r\nThe  people who have suffered under unnecessary rules and\r\n\r\nregulations  would  be  in  the  best  position  to  make\r\n\r\nrecommendations for the better.  Officers from  different\r\n\r\nlevels within the Ministry should also be represented, as\r\n\r\nthey  are  the  ones who know best the grouses  from  the\r\n\r\nground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is making fundamental changes to\r\n\r\npromote entrepreneurship.  This is encouraging and  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  these changes, we are making progressive  steps  in\r\n\r\nthe right direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, it is a\r\n\r\ntradition  for me to attend the gathering  of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nMerchants  Associations on the first day of  Chinese  New\r\n\r\nYear.  I have been doing this since becoming an MP.  What\r\n\r\nstruck  me  in  this year's annual get-together  was  the\r\n\r\ndepressing  mood - a sense of hopelessness and  defeatism\r\n\r\nthat the situation in Singapore is no longer salvageable.\r\n\r\nI  have  not felt anything like this before, to  see  our\r\n\r\npeople  discouraged  and demoralised,  on  the  verge  of\r\n\r\ngiving up.  This was not evident during the 1997 regional\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  and  its aftermath.   Our  people  are\r\n\r\nlooking for ideas, advice and seeking answers to get  out\r\n\r\nof  their dire straits.  We need to buoy up their spirit.\r\n\r\nThey  need to be encouraged and given hope and confidence\r\n\r\nthat  we have the resources and resolve to overcome  this\r\n\r\nrecession.  We have been able to do so in the  past.   We\r\n\r\nshall be able to do this yet again, emerging stronger  to\r\n\r\ntake advantage when the recovery comes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When DPM Lee presented the picture and solutions in\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Budget,  they  are  realistic,  sound   and\r\n\r\nplausible.   Yet,  they  seem to  be  at  odds  with  the\r\n\r\nexperience,  sentiments  and  feelings  of  many   people\r\n\r\noutside  the Chamber.  The measures required are  painful\r\n\r\nbut  inevitable.  We have to take the bitter medicine  if\r\n\r\nwe  want to recover and there is no easy painless way out\r\n\r\nof  this  recession.   Indeed, the  Budget  measures  are\r\n\r\nbroadly strategic and qualitative in nature, dealing  not\r\n\r\njust with the immediate issues but having an eye for  the\r\n\r\nnext 15 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the intellect and the emotions is the\r\n\r\nattitude and mindset needed to act out our choices.   Our\r\n\r\nactions  must be based on the harsh realities before  us.\r\n\r\nWe  have  the natural human tendency to deny  we  have  a\r\n\r\nproblem  and wish that the problem would go away  without\r\n\r\nus taking the painful medicine.  We were well aware\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  need to restructure our economy since  the  1985\r\n\r\nrecession.  We had a good run of 10 years until  we  were\r\n\r\nhit  by the 1997 regional financial crisis.  Now we  have\r\n\r\nto  face the harsh realities of having to deal with  both\r\n\r\neconomic restructuring and the severe downturn.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy the depressed feeling has been much more acute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps when we dealt with the 1997 financial\r\n\r\ncrisis,  we  should not have slowed down the  process  of\r\n\r\nrestructuring our economy.  We cannot afford at this time\r\n\r\nto  delay any further to restructure our economy.  We are\r\n\r\naware  of  the high cost required in terms of job  losses\r\n\r\nthrough  retrenchment,  pay  cuts,  and  fresh  graduates\r\n\r\nfinding  difficulties  to secure  jobs  quickly.   It  is\r\n\r\nunfortunate  that  all the painful  measures  are  taking\r\n\r\nplace  at  the  same time and affecting  a  large  cross-section of our people.  If we are to take bold steps  now\r\n\r\nto restructure our economy, we would be able to take full\r\n\r\nadvantage of the recovery of the global economy  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the marine industry is a good example of an\r\n\r\nindustry  that  went  through  the  1985  recession  with\r\n\r\nmassive  retrenchments and severe restructuring.  Looking\r\n\r\nback,  the  actions  taken in those years  to  cut  over-capacity  saved the marine industry.  Today, the industry\r\n\r\nhas  not only survived but prospered.  The marine  sector\r\n\r\nwas  labelled a `sunset' industry.  It  has been  a  long\r\n\r\n`sunset'  for  the marine industry after  18  years.   It\r\n\r\nremains  a cyclical industry but the sector is  able  and\r\n\r\nready  to  deal  with  the cyclical  nature  of  business\r\n\r\nbecause   they   have  put  in  place  a  structure   and\r\n\r\norganisation that is resilient to cope with  the  upswing\r\n\r\nand  downswing in the business.  It is to the  industry's\r\n\r\ncredit that it was able to absorb some of the former  PSA\r\n\r\nemployees who lost their jobs recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us who went through the bitter\r\n\r\nexperience of the 1985 recession, we have gained valuable\r\n\r\nlessons  on  how  to  survive and  prosper  in  a  highly\r\n\r\ncompetitive business.  Businesses that are built to  last\r\n\r\nrequire a stable, committed and diligent management team,\r\n\r\nstrong organisational skills, good cash management,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  to borrow beyond our means, be thrifty and lean, use\r\n\r\ncontract   workers,  instead  of  regular  employees,   a\r\n\r\nflexible  wage system that pays a lower base  salary  but\r\n\r\nwith highly variable bonuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that those Singapore\r\n\r\nestablishments that started in the 1960s and 70s and have\r\n\r\nmade  no attempt to shed, restructure or reorganise their\r\n\r\nbusinesses would have inherited an organisation  that  is\r\n\r\nflabby  with  high  cost  and  unable  to  compete  in  a\r\n\r\nderegulated  and  highly competitive globalised  business\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read a report recently that the majority of\r\n\r\nAmerican  CEOs do not have any experience in managing  an\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn because they were not exposed  to  the\r\n\r\nlast  recession that happened a decade ago.  We know that\r\n\r\npersonal experience is a good teacher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fortunate that DPM Lee had gained valuable\r\n\r\nexperience  when  he  helped  tackle  the  1985  economic\r\n\r\nrecession and this has placed him in very good stead when\r\n\r\nhe  chaired the Economic Review Committee.  The  Economic\r\n\r\nReview  Committee  Report  acts  as  the  foundation  and\r\n\r\ncornerstone of his Budget Statement this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that in last year's FY 2002 budget, we\r\n\r\nhad managed a small deficit of $94 million, compared to a\r\n\r\ndeficit of close to $2.7 billion in the year before in FY\r\n\r\n2001.   The smaller overall deficit was on account  of  a\r\n\r\nbetter  contribution of net investment income  of  $3,800\r\n\r\nmillion.  Perhaps DPM Lee can enlighten the House how the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is able to achieve a three-fold  increase  in\r\n\r\nnet  investment income between the years 2001  and  2002,\r\n\r\njumping from $1.375 billion to $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget, many quarters have hoped that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  could  have been bolder  with  a  higher\r\n\r\nbudget deficit.  The FY 2003 Budget is estimated to run a\r\n\r\ndeficit  of  close to $900 million, with a net investment\r\n\r\nincome  contribution estimated at about  $3,000  million.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Government were to continue to achieve the  same\r\n\r\nnet investment income\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof $3.8 billion, the Budget will end with a small deficit\r\n\r\nor even a balanced budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government has remained resolute\r\n\r\nnot  to accede to the call on Government to cut corporate\r\n\r\ntaxes  further  and others who want more  expenditure  to\r\n\r\nprop up the economy.  I agree that it is more prudent  to\r\n\r\ntake  the conservative approach.  We do not know how  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Iraq  will turn  out.   The  war  and  its\r\n\r\naftermath can play havoc to oil price increases  and  the\r\n\r\noverall  adverse  impact  on the  global  economy.   This\r\n\r\nGovernment has shown that it is prepared, as in the past,\r\n\r\nto  take off-budget measures to prevent our economy  from\r\n\r\ndeteriorating further.  And I hope that, as Dr John  Chen\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned  earlier,  the Government  could  give  an\r\n\r\nindication of such a possibility.  We shall have to  wait\r\n\r\nand  see  if  all these uncertainties in the Middle  East\r\n\r\nwill pan out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In promoting manufacturing and services as the twin\r\n\r\nengines of growth, we must recognise that we have  fallen\r\n\r\nbehind  in  our competitiveness.  Our business  cost  has\r\n\r\ngone  up  in comparison with other emerging economies  in\r\n\r\nthe  region  and  our productivity lags behind  the  cost\r\n\r\nincreases.   We  have to quickly bring the business  cost\r\n\r\ndown   before   more   companies   get   into   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   We should do our level  best  to  prevent\r\n\r\nmore  companies  from closing shop,  relocate  or  shrink\r\n\r\ntheir  operations that could aggravate our  already  high\r\n\r\nunemployment situation.\r\n\r\nLabour  and  land are two domestic components within  our\r\n\r\nmeans  to  influence  the  business  competitiveness  and\r\n\r\nprofitability.   We  have  to  bring  down  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nindustrial land, commercial properties and manpower costs\r\n\r\nof  our  businesses.  It is a good idea to cap the salary\r\n\r\nceiling  for  CPF  contributions at  $5,000,  instead  of\r\n\r\n$6,000.  The high income earners are able to manage their\r\n\r\nown  retirement plans.  These high income earners  should\r\n\r\nbe    subjected   to   greater   variability   in   their\r\n\r\nremuneration,   linking  their   pay   and   rewards   to\r\n\r\nperformance and profitability of the company.  This  will\r\n\r\nset the tone to put quickly in place the flexible\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwage  system against the seniority-based system that  has\r\n\r\nremained unchanged for some companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the effort to promote entrepreneurship, we have\r\n\r\nfirst  to develop a culture of entrepreneurship  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  The current adverse economic situation may just\r\n\r\nprovide  the right conditions and impetus for individuals\r\n\r\nto  be  self-employed and start up their own  businesses.\r\n\r\nMy  concern is the over-capacity situation in the  retail\r\n\r\nsector  where  the small retailers are already  suffering\r\n\r\nfrom  poor  business.   With  new  entrants,  the  retail\r\n\r\nbusiness  will be even more competitive and the situation\r\n\r\nwould worsen unless the economy improves and more foreign\r\n\r\nvisitors  and  expatriates  are  employed  to   work   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   As  HDB retailers contribute to  a  sizeable\r\n\r\nproportion  of neighbourhood shops, there is the  urgency\r\n\r\nto deal with HDB neighbourhood shops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has an excellent reputation in our\r\n\r\neducational  system.   It  requires  business  acumen  to\r\n\r\ntranslate  the  reputation and expertise into  successful\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   For many years, the Chartered  Institutions\r\n\r\nof   United  Kingdom  collect  large  sums  annually   in\r\n\r\norganising  examinations  for  their  courses  and  issue\r\n\r\ncertificates  qualifying  them  to  become   members   of\r\n\r\nprofessional   bodies.   Singapore  has  already   gained\r\n\r\nexpertise  in a number of areas.  We should  be  able  to\r\n\r\nconduct  our  own  examinations for  foreigners  who  are\r\n\r\ninterested   in  them  and  issue  relevant  certificates\r\n\r\nattesting  to the standards achieved in the examinations.\r\n\r\nIf properly organised and managed, they should contribute\r\n\r\nto making Singapore an education hub in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our top students have acquitted themselves very well\r\n\r\nin the reputable universities in the US and UK.  They are\r\n\r\ngifted  and would be able to fend for themselves whatever\r\n\r\neducational system we provide.  Our challenge is to bring\r\n\r\nan  expanded number of students in the next few levels to\r\n\r\nan  even  higher level of achievement than currently  the\r\n\r\ncase.  Our students have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  more  well-rounded and be  imbued  with  a  wider\r\n\r\ninterest.  They should be able to handle both the Science\r\n\r\nand  the  Humanities subjects with  ease.   There  is  an\r\n\r\nurgent need to encourage the interest and strengthen  the\r\n\r\nlearning of humanities in schools and universities.   The\r\n\r\nchallenge  in  working and dealing  in  a  cross-cultural\r\n\r\ncontext  and  issues  require  a  deep  appreciation  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the  Humanities subjects,  and  cross-cultural  issues  will pose a greater  challenge  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  and our students should be prepared for it.   Our\r\n\r\nyoung  who  neglect them do so at their  peril  in  later\r\n\r\nyears.   It is like the Chinese Language now.  No  parent\r\n\r\nneeds  to be persuaded on the importance of learning  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Language in schools today.  So I hope  that  our\r\n\r\nschools  do  not take the short-term view in  performance\r\n\r\nranking  at  the  expense of the long term  good  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents in the study of Arts and Humanities subjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the biggest challenge today is to help\r\n\r\npreserve the jobs of Singaporeans and for those  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed  to help them find new jobs.  This issue  will\r\n\r\nremain  with  us  as we expect a slower  growth  for  our\r\n\r\neconomy rising in the region of 3-5%, but unemployment is\r\n\r\nlikely to stay around 3-4%.  Lifelong learning has become\r\n\r\nmore  pressing.  I am glad the Government is taking  this\r\n\r\nvery  seriously with the setting up of a statutory  board\r\n\r\nto take care of this area.  But I like to echo many of my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  that  it  is the personal responsibility  and\r\n\r\nself-help of the individuals that matter.  This may be  a\r\n\r\nwake-up call to Singaporeans to take up lifelong learning\r\n\r\nseriously  to ensure their employability.  The Government\r\n\r\nis  in  a  good  position to draw up the information  and\r\n\r\nresources to help Singaporeans who are in need of work to\r\n\r\nbe  trained  and help find work.  Employers  should  also\r\n\r\nplay  their  part  to  be  fair  in  the  employment  and\r\n\r\ntreatment of Singapore workers.  They should not rely  on\r\n\r\nforeign  labour  if Singaporean workers are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nlower  their  expectations  and  work  hard  to  earn   a\r\n\r\nlivelihood for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy with the breadth and depth of\r\n\r\ncoverage  in  this  year's budget.  It  is  a  reassuring\r\n\r\nBudget.  The Government is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   top  of  the  situation.   We  have  the  resources.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  draw out their  courage  and  not  be\r\n\r\ndeterred  by the storm we are sailing through.   We  will\r\n\r\nindeed  reach  the safe harbour if all our hands  are  on\r\n\r\ndeck and focus on the direction we should be heading.  We\r\n\r\ncan then look forward to a better year ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, our economy recorded a 2.4%\r\n\r\nGDP  growth  in  2002. However, apart from transport  and\r\n\r\ncommunication,  all other sectors did  not  perform  well\r\n\r\ncompared with year 2000.  In terms of employment,  78,000\r\n\r\njobs were lost (3.9% drop) compared to year 2000. Yet, at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, unit business cost and the  unit  labour\r\n\r\ncost were higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this difficult time, it makes our work in\r\n\r\nstimulating   our  economy  harder  as  we  face   strong\r\n\r\nchallenges from the low cost manufacturing base of China.\r\n\r\nIt   has  been  attracting  many  investments  from   us,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the manufacturing sector.   In  2002,  we\r\n\r\nattracted  some  $9 billion worth of investments  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector,  but these  were  mainly  capital-intensive industries which do not create the same  number\r\n\r\nof  jobs to replace those that we have lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of business cost is still an important\r\n\r\npart  of  this budget.  On one hand, we hope  to  attract\r\n\r\nmore good investments to create job opportunities. On the\r\n\r\nother hand, we want to retain the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexisting manufacturing establishments so as not  to  lose\r\n\r\nthe jobs for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has introduced various measures to\r\n\r\nmake   it  attractive  for  the  factories  to  stay   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  such as rebates on property tax,  fix  petrol\r\n\r\ntax  at  level, lower diesel tax for taxi and change  OMV\r\n\r\ncalculation.   The  cut of such indirect  taxes  at  this\r\n\r\nmoment  implies that they are significant in the cost  of\r\n\r\noperation  in  our business. They increase  the  business\r\n\r\ncost.  Such ad hoc tax reductions are short term measures\r\n\r\nwhich   can  be  revoked  when  our  economy  has   fully\r\n\r\nrecovered, and we will go back to the original state, and\r\n\r\nit  would  continue  to  have  an  effect  on  increasing\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost  in Singapore.  So, when we are  reviewing\r\n\r\nall  these factors which would increase our business cost\r\n\r\nin  the  long term, we should look squarely on all  their\r\n\r\nimplications because they are disturbing matters whenever\r\n\r\nwe  talk  about  the  high cost  in  doing   business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rental cost, in the past two years, the price of\r\n\r\noffices   and  factories  dropped  by  34.6%  and   23.7%\r\n\r\nrespectively.  Although  there  has  been  a  significant\r\n\r\nreduction  during  the past two years, our office  rental\r\n\r\nprice is still ranked No. 18 in the world and our factory\r\n\r\nrent  ranked 12th in the world,  slightly lower than that\r\n\r\nof Taipei in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the rent will be decided by the balance\r\n\r\nbetween supply and demand.  It is also dependent  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  taxes levied on them.  For  example,  when  a\r\n\r\nlandlord buys a factory, he has to pay a 3% stamp fee and\r\n\r\nanother  4%  in  GST  on  the  transacted  price  of  the\r\n\r\nproperty.   Then, when the owner wants to  rent  it  out,\r\n\r\nthere is also a 10% of property tax on the assessed value\r\n\r\npaid  upfront  before  any rent is collected.  All  these\r\n\r\ntaxes contribute a significant 17% on top of the intended\r\n\r\nrent  of  the  factory. In other words, these  Government\r\n\r\ntaxes  have caused the factory rent to go up by 17% more.\r\n\r\nIt increases the cost of business significantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a factory or a warehouse comes under one title\r\n\r\ndeed, it would not be   possible\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  sub-divide the whole premises into smaller units  for\r\n\r\nseparate leases.  So, even if only a small portion of the\r\n\r\npremises is rented out, the owner has to pay the property\r\n\r\ntax  based  on  the assessed rental value of  the  entire\r\n\r\nfactory   or  warehouse.  This  has  caused  unfair   and\r\n\r\nunnecessary hardship to the owner,  especially at a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the  property  market is down.  This  property  tax\r\n\r\naspect  would have a very serious effect on  the  overall\r\n\r\nbusiness cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, transport cost in Singapore is one\r\n\r\nof  the highest in the world.  More than half of the cost\r\n\r\nof  owning  the company's vehicles comes as a  result  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  taxes.  In this year's  Budget,  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  decides to change the basis for  valuing  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  which  would result in a decrease  in  ARF  and\r\n\r\nexcise duty payable for most vehicles. He has also locked\r\n\r\nin  the  duty on petrol at its present rate, so  that  it\r\n\r\nwould not go up with the likely inflation of oil prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, these measures would help to contain our\r\n\r\ntransport  cost. I think we should thoroughly review  the\r\n\r\nvarious factors contributing to our high transport  cost,\r\n\r\nso that it would not be ranked No. 1 in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these direct taxes, there is also\r\n\r\ncompliance cost which adds to our total business cost.  I\r\n\r\nam very glad to see in this budget some mention about how\r\n\r\nto  do  away  with  some of the repeated  or  unnecessary\r\n\r\ncompliance  costs for the businessmen.  However,  in  our\r\n\r\ndaily   lives  and  also  in  the  process  of   business\r\n\r\noperation, in order to comply with some of the Government\r\n\r\nregulations, the compliance cost is very heavy.   Let  me\r\n\r\nquote three examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in a new industrial estate or agro-technology\r\n\r\npark, if you happen to be the first to take possession of\r\n\r\na  factory  in  this estate, and if there is  not  enough\r\n\r\npower  supply,  you would have to build a  substation  at\r\n\r\nyour own cost, and it will cost you some $200,000.  Those\r\n\r\nwho come in later can make use of the power\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsub-station, free of charge.  In other words,  the  first\r\n\r\nperson  who enters the estate will have to subsidise  the\r\n\r\ncost of the others who use the electricity supply in this\r\n\r\narea.  I think this is very unreasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if you are a property developer and you\r\n\r\nhave  purchased a few houses which you would subsequently\r\n\r\ndemolish  and  redevelop the land by building  a  row  of\r\n\r\nterrace  houses on it, according to the regulations,  you\r\n\r\nwould   have  to dig up the existing drain  and  build  a\r\n\r\nwider and deeper drain in the process of building the row\r\n\r\nof  terrace houses. Subsequently, you would have to cover\r\n\r\nup the newly built bigger drain with sand and gravel, and\r\n\r\nreconstruct  the  drain back to the original  state.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, there is an existing drain.   In  order  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  the  Government regulations,  you  have  to\r\n\r\nbroaden it and then, after completion, you have to put it\r\n\r\nback into the original state. This is an additional cost,\r\n\r\nwhich is unnecessary and a waste of time and money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it may sound ridiculous, but it is true.\r\n\r\nThere  are people complaining about the unpleasant  smell\r\n\r\ncoming  out from the farm. The farm owner was advised  by\r\n\r\nthe   authority  to  build  a  scrubber,  costing   about\r\n\r\n$100,000.   Despite  that, the authority  was  unable  to\r\n\r\nprescribe  an  emission  standard  or  propose  the  best\r\n\r\npossible  technology in dealing with the  odour  problem.\r\n\r\nSo,  even  after  building the scrubber, when  there  are\r\n\r\nfurther complaints, the owner would be called up, given a\r\n\r\nsummons  to go to court, and be fined as much as  $10,000\r\n\r\non each charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if this is to happen in our new industrial\r\n\r\nsites,  I am sure the EDB  would take up the matter  with\r\n\r\nJTC,  and  it  will  be resolved.  However,  the  farming\r\n\r\nindustry  comes  under  the  charge  of  AVA,   and   the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen have no recourse but to resign themselves  to\r\n\r\nfate, pay the fine and forget about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no denial that business cost is very high\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Apart from direct and indirect taxes,  the\r\n\r\ncompliance  cost  incurred by having to comply  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious Government rules and regulations\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  contributed  significantly  to  the  burden  of  our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should not accelerate its\r\n\r\nprocess to reduce our direct taxes to 20% by 2005.  If we\r\n\r\ncan  find some way to cut down on the indirect taxes  and\r\n\r\ncompliance  cost  to reduce the burden of our businessmen\r\n\r\nin the present difficult time, they can survive, and even\r\n\r\nhave  some profits in their business.  Otherwise, if they\r\n\r\nrun  into  losses  or  even have to  fold  up,  then  any\r\n\r\nreduction in income tax will have no bearing on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should do all we can to help them so that\r\n\r\nthey  can  survive and even make some profits.   If  they\r\n\r\nhave no profit, they do not pay any taxes, so even if  it\r\n\r\nis reduced to 20%, what is the use of it?  We should look\r\n\r\ninto   this  heavy  burden  that  is  brought  upon   our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen because of the high compliance cost.  If  the\r\n\r\nsituation can be improved, all businesses, big and small,\r\n\r\nwill  find it more attractive to stay in Singapore.  They\r\n\r\ncan  be  more  competitive and can face  the  competition\r\n\r\nposed by the low-cost localities  around us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Thank\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.  I will\r\n\r\nbe   touching   only   on  entrepreneurship,   and   more\r\n\r\nspecifically one or two aspects of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased that the Government, in the\r\n\r\nBudget, does not see entrepreneurship as a branch of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  or  as  an industry, but as a cultural  mindset.\r\n\r\nFor Singaporeans to be entrepreneurial, there has to be a\r\n\r\ncultural  shift, and to quote the Minister of  State  for\r\n\r\nTrade   and  Industry,  Mr  Raymond  Lim,  earlier,   the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit has to be one which permeates  all\r\n\r\nwalks  of  life, not only in businesses.  I do not  think\r\n\r\nthat  the entrepreneurial spirit is just about maximising\r\n\r\nfinancial  profits,  but it has  to  do  with  maximising\r\n\r\npotential of resources, lateral thinking, creativity  and\r\n\r\nthe  pursuit  of  human ideals.  These are  some  of  the\r\n\r\nqualities  stated  by my colleague,  Ms  Indranee  Rajah,\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship is equally applicable in family\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  social work as it is in  businesses  and\r\n\r\nMNCs.   I agree with the Minister of State that we cannot\r\n\r\nmanufacture entrepreneurship, but we can enable people to\r\n\r\nbe  entrepreneurs.  But we, as a society,  also  can  and\r\n\r\nshould do more.  We, as a society, need to evolve into an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial one.  I do not think that we  can  become\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial after one budget debate.   Even  all  the\r\n\r\nfiscal  measures put together in the Budget Statement  do\r\n\r\nnot  create  an  entrepreneurial society.  However,  this\r\n\r\nBudget  recognises entrepreneurship for what it  actually\r\n\r\nis,  elusive  though it may be, and it  decides  to  move\r\n\r\ntowards  a more entrepreneurial society.  This House  and\r\n\r\nall Singaporeans have to look at it in the long term, and\r\n\r\nwe  shall  continue to monitor our progress as we,  as  a\r\n\r\nsociety, evolve the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to my next point, Sir, on\r\n\r\nsomething which is related to this elusive nature of  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  spirit.   We  have  decided  to  embrace\r\n\r\nglobalisation,  the  infocomm  technology,  and  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.   We  have  decided to  make  our  country  more\r\n\r\nattractive  for  investments.  We  are  taking  steps  to\r\n\r\nlessen  impediments and increase attractiveness  for  top\r\n\r\nbusiness  people to invest in Singapore.  We are allowing\r\n\r\nour  people  more leeway to explore and to express.   The\r\n\r\nsum  total  of  all  the recommendations  in  the  recent\r\n\r\nreports  -  whether in the review of the upper  secondary\r\n\r\nand  pre-university education or in the ERC  -  not  only\r\n\r\nallows  for  more peaks in our people's achievements  but\r\n\r\nalso  enables these peaks to go higher.  But not everyone\r\n\r\ncan keep up with the changes that are taking place.  Some\r\n\r\nare   struggling   just  to  remain   relevant.    These,\r\n\r\njuxtaposed  with  the enhancements of  peaks,  mean  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be a widening of the social gap between  the\r\n\r\nvery top and the very bottom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I face many applications for financial help\r\n\r\nor otherwise from genuinely hardship-stricken families, I\r\n\r\nalso  see many brand new Maseratis, Boxsters and  XJs  on\r\n\r\nour roads.  Being a young nation, Sir, social cohesion is\r\n\r\npivotal  to  our  well-being.  Recent events  related  to\r\n\r\nextremism\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  terrorism have caused us to worry about  our  inter-racial and inter-religious relations.  Similarly, we have\r\n\r\nto  ensure that changes in the economic landscape do  not\r\n\r\nover stretch our social fabric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible way to keep this gap down - and I say\r\n\r\nthis only for discussion - is by placing caps at the top.\r\n\r\nThis  House has decided that capping the top runs counter\r\n\r\nto the efforts to attract and keep investors, and we need\r\n\r\ninvestors  to  keep our economy going,  in  other  words,\r\n\r\ntaxing  our  top earners can only be done  to  a  limited\r\n\r\nextent, an extent to be determined, among others, by  tax\r\n\r\nregimes  in  other  countries and other  costs  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way to reduce this gap is to raise the\r\n\r\nbase.   Again,  there  are  limitations  to  this.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  seeks to be a fair, not welfare  state  -  to\r\n\r\nborrow  a quote from a very well-known book, which  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  all  of  us have read or are reading - and  further\r\n\r\ndoling  out too much help runs counter to our  vision  to\r\n\r\nevolve  an  entrepreneurial  culture.   But  if  our  top\r\n\r\nearners  are  more conscious of the need to maintain  our\r\n\r\nsocial cohesion and are happy to do so, then we might  be\r\n\r\nable to raise the base without antagonising the top.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the numerous fiscal measures in the Budget\r\n\r\nthat encourage and facilitate charitable acts.  But, Sir,\r\n\r\nlike  entrepreneurship, charity is  also  driven  by  the\r\n\r\nhuman  spirit.  We need to evolve the spirit of  charity,\r\n\r\nsocial  consciousness and voluntarism.  Schools now  have\r\n\r\ncommunity involvement programmes.  We have also  recently\r\n\r\nestablished a National Volunteers Centre.  These are only\r\n\r\ntwo  of  many structures and programmes recently  set  up\r\n\r\nthat  would help in evolving the spirit of charity.   The\r\n\r\nsuccess of the programmes should not be measured only  in\r\n\r\nterms of how many activities were conducted and how  many\r\n\r\npeople  were  reached, or even how strongly  people  feel\r\n\r\ntowards  charity and voluntarism.  Perhaps, the ideal  is\r\n\r\nreached when our poor and socially handicapped feel  that\r\n\r\nthey are not left out, that they see\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe rich as their partners and their helpers, and not  as\r\n\r\ntargets  of anger or envy.  This can happen when our  top\r\n\r\nand higher income earners have evolved the genuine spirit\r\n\r\nto help and volunteer to do charity work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can and should evolve this spirit. If we\r\n\r\nrecognise  the  need  and  are resolved  to  evolve  this\r\n\r\nelusive  entrepreneurial culture, then, similarly,  there\r\n\r\nis  no  reason  why  we  cannot  resolve  and  evolve   a\r\n\r\ncharitable culture.  Indeed, both must go hand in hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing  me  to  participate in this Budget  debate.   I\r\n\r\nspeak  in support of the 2003 Budget in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Finance,  Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nHsien Loong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate Mr Lee's pro-business Budget and his\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the  long-term  vision  for  Singapore,  as\r\n\r\noutlined by the Economic Review Committee Report.  Sir, I\r\n\r\nagree that the Budget should create attractive conditions\r\n\r\nto  aggressively attract foreign direct investments.   To\r\n\r\nthis  end, we have fine-tuned our tax regime to  make  it\r\n\r\nattractive   for   both   businesses   and   individuals.\r\n\r\nSingapore  currently has one of the most  attractive  tax\r\n\r\nregimes in the region.  I am confident that these changes\r\n\r\nwill   attract  companies  and  talent  to  relocate   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  this, in turn, will  help  to  boost  our\r\n\r\neconomy and to create more jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget also encourages Singapore companies to\r\n\r\nlook  outwards  to  new markets and, at  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nentices  foreign  companies that have global  operations.\r\n\r\nCompanies that use Singapore as a base of operation  will\r\n\r\nobtain tax reliefs for foreign-sourced incomes, royalties\r\n\r\nand  service  incomes.  There is even this  deferment  of\r\n\r\nincome taxes for two years, if their overseas investments\r\n\r\nsuffer   operational   losses  for  eligible   investment\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, it is noted that these advantages\r\n\r\noutlined in the Budget would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  be felt by small businesses in these hard times, and\r\n\r\ndo  not  serve  as a sufficient catalyst  to  help  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses grow into regional businesses.  I am concerned\r\n\r\nthat  most  of  the business cost cuts are temporary  for\r\n\r\nanother six months.  This does not bode well for our long-term  goal  of reducing costs and attracting investments.\r\n\r\nGovernment  infrastructure and services have not  seen  a\r\n\r\ndrastic  drop in cost.  For example, it has been reported\r\n\r\nthat business cost still rose by about 5% in 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cite an example, just submitting an application\r\n\r\nto  URA  for approval of simple alteration and additional\r\n\r\nwork will cost a businessman $2,080, inclusive of 4% GST.\r\n\r\nAnd  in  order  to build a development of 100,000  square\r\n\r\nmetres  of  gross  floor  area, the  cost  for  essential\r\n\r\nwritten approval - not even talking about building - is a\r\n\r\nhefty  sum  of  $350,000.  Many  of  the  architects  and\r\n\r\nconsultants  are  stating  that  these  fees  were   last\r\n\r\nreviewed  in 2000.  They have not seen any drop for  many\r\n\r\nyears,  despite  the intense efficiency and  productivity\r\n\r\ndrives,  and use of information technology.  It  is  time\r\n\r\nfor the Government agency to review its cost of provision\r\n\r\nof  services.  It is my view that the Government needs to\r\n\r\nreach out to the man-in-the-street, to be more sensitive,\r\n\r\nand to have the ability to be flexible.  As my colleague,\r\n\r\nDr John Chen, earlier said, the Government agency must be\r\n\r\nits customer's advocate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite another example of the\r\n\r\nsensitivity  and  flexibility that the Government  agency\r\n\r\ncould  help the local small businessmen.  An eating house\r\n\r\noperator  has rented a ground floor of eight conservation\r\n\r\nshophouses for his new eating house.  It needs to  remove\r\n\r\nthe  ground  floor  adjoining walls  of  the  shophouses.\r\n\r\nAccording   to   URA  guidelines,  all  alterations   and\r\n\r\nadditional  works  for conservation  houses  need  to  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  for  approval.  This is acceptable.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  charges are now a whopping $16,640, as it is treated\r\n\r\nas  eight  applications  for  the  removal  of  six  non-structural walls shared by the eight shophouses.   If  it\r\n\r\nis  treated as one application, the cost would be $2,080,\r\n\r\ninclusive of 4% GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would next like to talk about portable\r\n\r\nmedical benefits.  I would like to compliment the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance   for   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  these  benefits.   We  have  had   much\r\n\r\ndiscussion about our greying workers in this  House.   As\r\n\r\nour   workforce   becomes  greyer,   they   become   more\r\n\r\nsusceptible  to  job changes and losses, whether  due  to\r\n\r\ninappropriate skill sets or as requirements  for  workers\r\n\r\nchange,  or  in  view of the existing  structure  of  age\r\n\r\nremuneration  pay  system.   In  response  to  an   aging\r\n\r\nworkforce,  the Budget has identified new ways  in  which\r\n\r\nthe burden of healthcare can be reduced for employers and\r\n\r\nthe ageing workforce alike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by encouraging employers to implement either\r\n\r\nthe portable medical benefits or the transferable medical\r\n\r\ninsurance  scheme,  employers will continue  to  enjoy  a\r\n\r\ndeduction of 2% of the total employees' remuneration  for\r\n\r\nmedical   expenses   incurred.   If  employers   do   not\r\n\r\nparticipate in this scheme, they will enjoy only half the\r\n\r\namount.  Since the portable medical benefits scheme  will\r\n\r\ninvolve additional contributions by the employers to  the\r\n\r\nMedisave  accounts of the employees, the Budget has  also\r\n\r\nstipulated  that  the  employers'  deductions   will   be\r\n\r\nincreased to $1,500 per employee per year.  The  concerns\r\n\r\nare  that  this  lump  sum  will  become  attractive  for\r\n\r\nemployers to favour younger employees, although  I  agree\r\n\r\nthat the absolute sum is very attractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for us to determine whether the\r\n\r\nquantum  proposed  under  the portable  medical  benefits\r\n\r\nscheme  is  able  to meet the cost of healthcare  in  our\r\n\r\naging workforce sufficiently.  There is a danger that the\r\n\r\ncost  of healthcare insurance premiums could dramatically\r\n\r\nrise  because  of  age,  which would  again  be  counter-productive.  We need to ensure that this does not  happen\r\n\r\nduring this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to appeal for the\r\n\r\nenjoyment  of  this  2%  deduction  limit  to  thoughtful\r\n\r\nemployers who have allowed ex-employees, in view of early\r\n\r\nretrenchments  due to restructuring of  the  company,  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  take advantage of the attractive  insurance\r\n\r\nrates, because\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the large global-based number of employees.  One good\r\n\r\nexample  is  Exxon-Mobil, which has  done  so.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  important for employees aged  50s  who  would\r\n\r\nhave   to  buy  insurance  again  due  to  forced   early\r\n\r\nretirement and, in general, they would have to pay higher\r\n\r\ninsurance rates on re-acceptance into the medical schemes\r\n\r\nand  subject  to  medical review.   This  exemption  will\r\n\r\nencourage  more companies and statutory boards,  such  as\r\n\r\nPSA  and HDB - I do not know whether they have done so  - to  consider allowing their retrenched workers or  early-terminated  employees to continue to tap on the  existing\r\n\r\ninsurance benefits or schemes with the relevant insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies.  This will help the affected workers  to  tide\r\n\r\nover  their  hardship,  and not  reduce  their  insurance\r\n\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this economic downturn, it becomes necessary\r\n\r\nfor a caring Government to help its needy citizens.  Even\r\n\r\na  little  assistance goes a long way for those who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  affected by this economic downturn.  Sir, while  we\r\n\r\nhave  several  assistance programmes  in  place  for  the\r\n\r\nbottom  10% of Singaporeans, my feeling is that the  help\r\n\r\nnet  is not enough for the middle income group.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthe  4-roomers have upgraded themselves during  the  boom\r\n\r\ntime  and  without proper credit guidance.  Nobody  would\r\n\r\nhave  foreseen such a long period and severe downturn  of\r\n\r\nour  economy.  Many of such families are in need of  more\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the existing schemes offered, again by the\r\n\r\nMCDS  and  the  CDCs, are varied, and with many  acronyms\r\n\r\nattached to the schemes.  Residents are confused and  not\r\n\r\nclear  of these assistance schemes and many of them  have\r\n\r\nvery  minor  differences.   I  hope  these  two  critical\r\n\r\nagencies  could  re-package these minor  differences  and\r\n\r\nhighlight the assistance programmes to the needy  and  to\r\n\r\nthose  workers  who  are affected by early  retrenchment.\r\n\r\nThe  booklets  for  retrenched workers  provided  by  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring  companies should  include  some  of  these\r\n\r\nfinancial, social and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamily assistance schemes provided by the MCDS, the  CDCs\r\n\r\nand even the FSCs within the communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the man-in-the street is already facing a tough\r\n\r\ntime  in  this economic downturn.  We will  not  see  any\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery  anytime soon.  So,  Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\nexpect  a  rough road ahead.  In fact, our Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  made  it clear that he expects things to  get  worse\r\n\r\nbefore  they  get  better.  And  Singaporeans  have  been\r\n\r\ntightening their belts for quite some time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we create ample advantages for the\r\n\r\ninternational  business community so that  Singapore  can\r\n\r\nsucceed in the new economy and bring in new jobs  to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  we must also provide as much assistance  to  our\r\n\r\nlocal   businesses,  providing  the  local  support   and\r\n\r\nservices,  and also carry as much of the burden  for  our\r\n\r\nneedy  citizens,  many of whom have  contributed  to  our\r\n\r\nstellar growth in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Budget Statement be proceeded\r\n\r\nwith  beyond  4.30  pm  and the  proceedings  thereon  be\r\n\r\nexempted  at  this day's sitting from the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 1. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br>3.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Transport and Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan): Mr Speaker, I speak in support of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is ERC-inspired. It is an\r\n\r\nimportant first step to re-position our economy  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC is a reincarnation of the 1985 Economic\r\n\r\nCommittee, but its karma is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent.   Almost a generation has passed  between  the\r\n\r\ntwo.   The 1985 Economic Committee Report and the changes\r\n\r\nit  launched  led to more than a decade  of  very  strong\r\n\r\ngrowth  for  Singapore.  So, the question is whether  the\r\n\r\nERC  Report will be just as successful.  Will it too lead\r\n\r\nto another decade of robust growth for Singapore and well-paying jobs for Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideas are out there in the ERC Report. But, as\r\n\r\na  friend  remarked recently, ideas are a dime  a  dozen.\r\n\r\nThe  ability  to  execute  is  what  is  worth  millions.\r\n\r\nWhether  the  ERC  Report will lead  to  success  depends\r\n\r\ncrucially  on  our collective attitude and joint  efforts\r\n\r\ntowards restructuring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the ideas in the ERC Report are not new.\r\n\r\nYou can find them in the 1985 EC Report.  For example, my\r\n\r\nServices  Sub-Committee's idea of  making  education  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare  services engines of our growth was  not  new.\r\n\r\nIt  was a major recommendation in 1985.  So, why are they\r\n\r\nbeing recycled in 2003?  Obviously, it means that the old\r\n\r\nrecommendations were not fully exploited.  I was  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Trade and Industry during this  intervening\r\n\r\nperiod.   I  can  testify that it was  not  for  lack  of\r\n\r\ntrying.  But the economic agencies did bump against  many\r\n\r\nobstacles.  For example, in the case of health  services,\r\n\r\nthere  is genuine worry that if a large number of foreign\r\n\r\npatients are here, competing with local patients for  the\r\n\r\nattention  of  our doctors, they may drive up  healthcare\r\n\r\ncost.   In  other  words, there is  a  trade-off  between\r\n\r\neconomic objective and social priorities.  So, unless  we\r\n\r\nhave  a forum to debate such concerns, we will remain  in\r\n\r\nambivalence and under-perform.  Hence, our recommendation\r\n\r\nto  set up a Ministerial Committee on Services where such\r\n\r\nissues  can  be  connected and  trade-offs  made.   I  am\r\n\r\ncheered by Deputy Prime Minister Lee's decision to  chair\r\n\r\nthis  Ministerial Committee.  Many hard choices will have\r\n\r\nto be made, going forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one major difference between 1985 and\r\n\r\nnow.   Then  we were truly way ahead of the region.   But\r\n\r\nover the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears, the others have caught up.  We are still ahead  in\r\n\r\nmost areas, but the gap in capabilities has narrowed.  We\r\n\r\nhave  good hospitals and good schools, good universities,\r\n\r\nbut  it is no longer sufficient to be good, as the others\r\n\r\nhave also built up good institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody pushed me this book, Good to Great by Jim\r\n\r\nCollins.  Collins spent five years looking into why  some\r\n\r\ncompanies become great but many others do not.   His  key\r\n\r\ninsight is: \"Good is the enemy of great.  And that is one\r\n\r\nof  the  key  reasons why we have so little that  becomes\r\n\r\ngreat.\"  This is his observation:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We don't have great schools, principally because we\r\n\r\nhave  good  schools.The vast majority of companies  never\r\n\r\nbecome  great, precisely because the vast majority become\r\n\r\nquite good - and that is their main problem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying Jim Collins' insight to the ERC Report, my\r\n\r\ntake  is that being good is not enough in our next  phase\r\n\r\nof  development.   We need great institutions,  and  many\r\n\r\nmore of them, going forward.  We need to do four things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must aim high. Good is no longer good\r\n\r\nenough.   Without the resources, critical  mass  and  low\r\n\r\ncost structures, we will not be able to compete if we are\r\n\r\nmerely good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate this point, look at our Changi\r\n\r\nAirport.  For four million people, we do not need and  do\r\n\r\nnot  deserve a world-class airport.  But because we  plan\r\n\r\nit  and  we run it to serve 400 million, we have  Changi.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  perfect  example  of  the  abundance  mindset,\r\n\r\nfocusing  on opportunities.  Had we adopted the  scarcity\r\n\r\nmindset of focusing on constraints, Changi would  not  be\r\n\r\nthere and we will all be poorer for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, Matsushita Refrigeration Industries, the\r\n\r\nworld's   No.  2  maker  of  compressors  for   household\r\n\r\nrefrigerators,  celebrated its 30th anniversary  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   At  a  time when many companies  are  crying\r\n\r\ntheir  lungs out about the challenge of manufacturing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Matsushita is expanding its activities  here.\r\n\r\nIt aims high.  It aims to make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  the world's No. 1 R&D Centre and Manufacturing\r\n\r\nSolution  Hub.   Its  Singapore factory  is  the  largest\r\n\r\nfacility  in  the  world,  making  more  than   half   of\r\n\r\nMatsushita's  global output.  Last week, it launched  the\r\n\r\nworld's  most efficient compressor, designed by  the  R&D\r\n\r\nteam in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Esplanade is not of the same scale as the Sydney\r\n\r\nOpera  House,  although it is not  less  charming.   Like\r\n\r\nChangi Airport, we built it to serve a larger hinterland.\r\n\r\nTo  attract  the  clientele, our  facilities,  especially\r\n\r\nacoustics, have to be world-class.  Last December,  tenor\r\n\r\nJose  Carreras performed in our Concert Hall and  he  was\r\n\r\nall  praise.   He said, \"It's probably the  world's  best\r\n\r\nmodern  hall and one of the world's top concert halls  of\r\n\r\nall times.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, let us move, and move faster than the\r\n\r\nfastest  in China and elsewhere.  Those of us  who  visit\r\n\r\nChina  regularly know how fast some of the  cities  there\r\n\r\nare  moving.   Just  look  at  broadband  connections  in\r\n\r\nhotels.  They are now fairly common in China, but our own\r\n\r\nhotels  here are still slow to implement it.  At the  end\r\n\r\nof  the day, we win a race only if we can run faster than\r\n\r\nour  competitors.  The ERC Report contains many  sensible\r\n\r\nrecommendations, but actual implementation and the  speed\r\n\r\nof implementation is the key.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, learn from our successes and our failures.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to apply our knowledge more widely in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  build  up new knowledge faster.  We have pockets  of\r\n\r\nexcellence.   I  may be biased, being from  MITA,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink  our  libraries  have done a  remarkable  job.   We\r\n\r\nshould  apply  what they did to other  areas.   Likewise,\r\n\r\nNETS,  Tradenet are all remarkable successes.  We  should\r\n\r\napply our knowledge in cluster information integration in\r\n\r\nother areas, for example, in healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we should especially learn from our failures.\r\n\r\nThis  follows from the need to move fast.  When you  move\r\n\r\nfast,  you  must be prepared to make some  mistakes.   We\r\n\r\nmust then be willing to readily admit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmistakes, change quickly and correct them.  For if we  do\r\n\r\nnot  learn  from our mistakes, we would have  wasted  our\r\n\r\ntuition fees and, worse, repeat the mistakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, be frugal. We should try to do more with\r\n\r\nless.   Even as we aim high, our feet must be  firmly  on\r\n\r\nthe ground, focusing on the bottom line.  If our feet are\r\n\r\nnot  on  the  ground, we will merely be creating  bubbles\r\n\r\nlike  the  dot.commers.  And, if we  are  not  delivering\r\n\r\nvalue at realistic prices, someone else would.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A CEO friend of mine had this to say about\r\n\r\nmanagement:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In my 26 years of working life, I have seen us\r\n\r\njumping  from  one  management  fad  to  another.    Each\r\n\r\nlaunched with great fanfare and consultants made tons  of\r\n\r\nmoney  from  fees.   All the while, I stuck  with  simple\r\n\r\nideas of:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) productivity = maximise output, minimise input;\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) quality is defined by the customers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) value = maximum perceived quality at lowest\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible cost;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the role of management is to help the frontline\r\n\r\nstaff deliver maximum value to the customers.  Everything\r\n\r\nelse is unnecessary bureaucracy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He may have over-dramatised, but I agree with his\r\n\r\nkey  message  that we should focus only  on  things  that\r\n\r\nmatter  to  customers and cut out unnecessary bureaucracy\r\n\r\nas  an  effective way to reduce cost.  Save every  single\r\n\r\ncent  and invest on the great stuff.  Acquire the culture\r\n\r\nof   being   frugal.    Look  at  our  first   generation\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  They are famously frugal.   And  this  is\r\n\r\nnot a uniquely Asian value.  The most successful American\r\n\r\ncompanies  in modern history are ferociously  competitive\r\n\r\non  cost -  Intel, Microsoft, Dell, Walmart, Cisco, South\r\n\r\nWest Airline, just to name a few.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up until at least 1998, Bill Gates flew economy, not\r\n\r\nfirst   class.    Walmart  employees,   including   their\r\n\r\nexecutives,  share rooms when on business  trips.   These\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  built  a strong corporate  culture  that\r\n\r\nrecognises and rewards employees for being frugal.   They\r\n\r\nknow that over the long haul, being cost-competitive is a\r\n\r\nkey competitive advantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of some natural advantages, we will\r\n\r\nalways need to be cost-competitive, not necessarily to be\r\n\r\nthe  cheapest,  but must provide the best value  for  our\r\n\r\ncustomers.  My sense is that during the boom years of the\r\n\r\nlast decade, we seem to have forgotten the wisdom of  the\r\n\r\nancient  sage:   Ju  an  si  wei,  ju  sheng  si  gan   (\r\n\r\n).   In victory, remember defeat.  In time of plenty,  we\r\n\r\nshould  be especially mindful of deprivation.  We  should\r\n\r\nwork  to  make  frugality a national culture  and  regain\r\n\r\nquickly our cost competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me return to the question: will\r\n\r\nthe  ERC Report bring in another decade of strong growth?\r\n\r\nAnd the answer is really in our hands.  Good is the enemy\r\n\r\nof  great.   If we are complacent, thinking that  we  are\r\n\r\ngood  and have arrived, then success will escape us.   On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  if we succumb to the current  economic\r\n\r\nslowdown  and  wring our hands in despair,  success  will\r\n\r\nalso  escape  us.  So, Straits Times' Chua Lee  Hoong  is\r\n\r\nright.  In her 5th March \"Budget 2003\" article, she hoped\r\n\r\nthat this Budget debate would generate the right buzz, by\r\n\r\nfocusing  on the big picture shift in direction  that  we\r\n\r\nare  making.  Instead, if we wallow in self-pity and talk\r\n\r\nourselves into a depression, we deserve to lose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, I had the pleasant duty to give away the\r\n\r\nWoman  of  the Year Awards to Olivia Lum and  Elim  Chew.\r\n\r\nSeveral   parliamentary  colleagues  were   also   there.\r\n\r\nWonderful choices by the judging panel, especially  at  a\r\n\r\ntime like this.  These two ladies did not wallow in self-pity  when  they were down.  They had gone  through  very\r\n\r\ntough  times, but they picked themselves up and succeeded\r\n\r\nagainst  great  odds.   And  that  was  also  how  modern\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  built  by  our  parents,  despite  poorer\r\n\r\nendowment  and  more hostile neighbourhood.   Surely  our\r\n\r\ngeneration  can  do  better, given better  education  and\r\n\r\nstronger resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Sing Singapore song, Dick Lee had\r\n\r\nthis to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Look where we are, we've come so far\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there's still a long, long way to go\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all of my heart, I will care\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll play my part, I will share\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With family and friends, together we'll stand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the end, hand in hand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will get there\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share his optimism and his spirit of confidence.\r\n\r\nRain  will  not  last forever.  While  we  may  not  like\r\n\r\ngetting  wet, rain also clears the air and nourishes  new\r\n\r\ngrowth.   Singapore has all the conditions  to  grow  and\r\n\r\nflourish again when the sun comes up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I rise in support of the motion as proposed by  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement sends a clear signal to all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  We must work together as one united people\r\n\r\nto  face  the  new challenges in the global economy.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to  develop  a  resilient and diversified  domestic\r\n\r\neconomy, and position Singapore in the global market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's uncertain world, we must equip our people\r\n\r\nto  be  more flexible and hardworking.  It is  a  mindset\r\n\r\nchange, which we must encourage all Singaporeans to adopt\r\n\r\nin  order  to  have a better future.  I  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister that \"success ultimately depends on  the\r\n\r\nresourcefulness and resilience of Singaporeans.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Government moves its stride to\r\n\r\nglobalise  Singapore, we must not make Singaporeans  lose\r\n\r\nheart  that  they  are unable to cope  with  these  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges.    Incentives   and   encouragement   must    be\r\n\r\nstrategically  administered  to  develop  passion   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  For those who have difficulty coping  with\r\n\r\nthe  economy's  transition, we must lend a helping  hand.\r\n\r\nThis  includes  the  small and medium  enterprises  which\r\n\r\nemploy many Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three key aspects which the Government\r\n\r\nshould focus to make Singapore a globalised economy:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government must encourage and help all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to learn new skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government must help to strengthen our\r\n\r\nfirms to better cope with global competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Government must help both Singapore firms\r\n\r\nand Singaporeans to globalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Helping Singaporeans</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three groups of Singaporeans who require\r\n\r\nmore  help from the Government to be self-reliant.   They\r\n\r\nare,  first, needy Singaporeans who are chronically sick,\r\n\r\nmentally  sick or elderly; second, Singaporeans with  low\r\n\r\nskills  or  unemployed; and, third, dual income  families\r\n\r\nwhich have become single income families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last 12 months, about 9,000 residents\r\n\r\nin  the  North West CDC district have approached the  CDC\r\n\r\nfor  job  assistance.   Although 3,000  have  managed  to\r\n\r\nsecure  jobs  through  the  CDC's  job  assistance,   job\r\n\r\ncounselling and training programmes, 6,000 residents  are\r\n\r\nstill jobless.  Despite many job-matching attempts,  many\r\n\r\njob seekers are still unable to find suitable jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two key reasons are cited for this situation.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the salary of jobs offered is unable to help the\r\n\r\njob seekers to meet their living expenses; and, secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  accessibility of jobs and homes is  poor,  resulting\r\n\r\nin  high  transportation cost for the  job  seekers.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  many  job seekers have either  low  skills  or\r\n\r\nirrelevant skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job seekers who are above 50 years old face greater\r\n\r\ndifficulty to return back to the job market.  The limited\r\n\r\nnumber  of  job vacancies in the market further compounds\r\n\r\nthis  problem.   As  for those who have medical  history,\r\n\r\nfirms  are  not willing to employ them for  fear  of  low\r\n\r\nproductivity and high medical expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some dual income families also face difficulty\r\n\r\ndue  to  over  financial commitments  or  poor  financial\r\n\r\nplanning.  Many had miscalculated their sources of income\r\n\r\nand  were  caught  off  guard by the  prolonged  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.   In  fact, quite a number of these  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nstay  in  4-  or  5-room HDB flats,  and  receive  lesser\r\n\r\nutilities  and  S&C  rebates from the  Government.   Very\r\n\r\noften, their children's needs and education are affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to propose the following measures for\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Creation of jobs. More incentives should be\r\n\r\noffered  for firms to provide more jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThese  include part-time jobs, flexible jobs or  contract\r\n\r\nwork.   The People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme  (PJTP)\r\n\r\nshould  be  further  enhanced  to  include  part-time  or\r\n\r\ncontract work.  We must also render more support to those\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisations which  provide  elderly,\r\n\r\nfamily and medical care services in the community.   More\r\n\r\nPJTP  programmes should be introduced in these VWOs.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  we can build a larger pool of healthcare  and\r\n\r\nsocial  service workers to meet the future  needs  of  an\r\n\r\nageing population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Skills upgrading. The key ingredient to self-reliance is to have a positive and flexible mindset.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must have the \"never say die\" attitude.   We\r\n\r\nmust continually strive to improve our employable skills.\r\n\r\nWith   the   correct   attitude  and   multiple   skills,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will always be employable in a  diversified\r\n\r\neconomy.   The  Government should also  let  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntake  ownership of their own skills upgrading.  We should\r\n\r\nintroduce a \"portable training benefits\" scheme,  whereby\r\n\r\nworkers  can take their own initiative to attend approved\r\n\r\ntraining  courses which are recognised  by  the  National\r\n\r\nSkills  Recognition  System.  Sir, I  fully  support  the\r\n\r\nspecial  transfer  of  $500  million  into  the  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning  Fund.   What  is needed  is  a  more  effective\r\n\r\noutreach to encourage Singaporeans to continually upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir  skills.  The Skills Development Fund has  achieved\r\n\r\nsome success in upgrading workers through\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfirms.   We  should allow more flexibility and incentives\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans to take initiative to learn more skills.\r\n\r\nWith  a  portable training benefit scheme,  workers  will\r\n\r\nhave more options to upgrade their skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) \"Means test\" and subsidy. We should review our\r\n\r\n\"means  test\"  and allow more flexibility to  help  needy\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are chronically sick, mentally sick  and\r\n\r\nelderly.   While  we  encourage  families  to  help   one\r\n\r\nanother,  some  working class families do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  ability  to help their parents  and  siblings.\r\n\r\nThis  is  especially  so when there  are  family  members\r\n\r\nsuffering from chronic illnesses.  The long-term  medical\r\n\r\nexpenses  will put severe strain on the families.   Thus,\r\n\r\nthe  Government should provide more social assistance  to\r\n\r\nthese  needy Singaporeans and reduce the burden of  their\r\n\r\nfamily members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, no fee subsidy is provided for pre-school\r\n\r\neducation.   Families with a per capita  income  of  less\r\n\r\nthan  $700  usually  face difficulty  to  pay  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren's   pre-school  education.   With  the   growing\r\n\r\nimportance  of pre-school education, I hope  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  can consider subsidising the fee for pre-school\r\n\r\neducation    in   Singapore.    To   further    encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to have more children, we should also review\r\n\r\nthe  subsidy for childcare and student care centres.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  three  children should be given equal  and  higher\r\n\r\nsubsidy so as to help working parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Medifund. Sir, I support the transfer of $100\r\n\r\nmillion  to  the  Medical Endowment  Fund.  The  Medifund\r\n\r\nscheme has provided much help to many needy Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThose  who  have  received help are appreciative  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance, which could  sometimes  amount  to\r\n\r\nthousands  of  dollars per case.  Based on feedback  from\r\n\r\nthe  CDC's  social  assistance services,  some  residents\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge the Government to consider  extending\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of  subsidy  for  Medifund  to  include  some\r\n\r\nnecessary  consumables for patients, such as stoma  bags,\r\n\r\nadult diapers and special liquid diet.  These consumables\r\n\r\ncan amount to hundreds of dollars per\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonth,  which  is  usually  beyond  the  reach  of  needy\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Helping Businesses</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the measures introduced by the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister to reduce business costs  and  increase\r\n\r\nthe  competitiveness of our companies.  We  must  explore\r\n\r\nmore innovative ways to encourage Singapore companies  to\r\n\r\nbe  globally  competitive.  We need to  relook  into  the\r\n\r\nfactors  of production and re-engineer our work processes\r\n\r\nto reduce cost, improve quality and productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest three areas which the\r\n\r\nGovernment can assist businesses:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Reducing business costs. More flexibility\r\n\r\nshould  be given to allow integrated and maximum  use  of\r\n\r\nland.  Factories and businesses must be located near  our\r\n\r\nlogistics   and  transport  infrastructure  to   minimise\r\n\r\ntravelling  time  and  reduce transportation  costs.   We\r\n\r\nshould facilitate complementary mix of tenants to achieve\r\n\r\nbetter  supply  chain  operations.  For  example,  anchor\r\n\r\ntenants   of   industrial  land  should  be  given   more\r\n\r\nflexibility   to   house  their  subsidiaries   or   sub-contractors/suppliers.   In  addition,  we  should   also\r\n\r\nconsider abolishing property tax in Singapore, especially\r\n\r\nfor  vacant  land  so  as  to  reduce  holding  cost  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses and encourage property ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should provide more support to help\r\n\r\nSingapore   firms  brand  their  products  and   services\r\n\r\noverseas.   I  would suggest that we develop  a  one-stop\r\n\r\nwebsite to showcase all Singapore's products and services\r\n\r\nin  the global market.  The portal can be the gateway for\r\n\r\nSingapore firms to brand their products and services.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, more business tie-ups could be initiated\r\n\r\nthrough the web.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Upgrade skills of staff. The Government should\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the development of capabilities of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  be globally competitive.  Except  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies, private firms are usually less  keen\r\n\r\nto send their staff for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nskills upgrading.  Sir, employers are the \"best teachers\"\r\n\r\nto train workers with employable skills.  We must provide\r\n\r\nincentives   to  encourage  employers  to   train   their\r\n\r\nemployees regularly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the recent revision of foreign worker levy, the\r\n\r\nGovernment should also consider providing incentives  for\r\n\r\nemployers  who train their staff in multiple skills.   In\r\n\r\nthis  aspect, I would urge SPRING Singapore  to  be  more\r\n\r\nproactive in encouraging employers, especially the  SMEs,\r\n\r\nto send their staff for skills upgrading regularly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Increase business opportunities. Sir, the\r\n\r\nreduction  of business cost cannot help firms to  survive\r\n\r\nif  there  is  no business.  The market in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nsmall  and  saturated.  Therefore, Singapore  firms  must\r\n\r\nsearch  for  new markets overseas.  Business  delegations\r\n\r\nled  by  the Government have indeed opened up many  doors\r\n\r\nfor  our  firms.   The  Government  should  continue   to\r\n\r\norganise  more  such delegations and facilitate  business\r\n\r\ntie-ups   in   specific  industries  such  as   financial\r\n\r\nservices,  design  consultancy,  trading,  transport,  or\r\n\r\nlogistics services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore is a hub for almost everything\r\n\r\n(seaport, airport, logistics, trading, info-comm, finance\r\n\r\nand tourism).  Although the visitor arrivals to Singapore\r\n\r\nincreased  marginally  by 0.6% to 7.5  million  in  2002,\r\n\r\nhotel  occupancy rate fell by 1.9% to 74%.  I  understand\r\n\r\nfrom  the  business community that many  visitors  merely\r\n\r\nused  Singapore  as  a  transit  or  tourist  stop  where\r\n\r\nvisitors  will only spend a few hours here.   Thereafter,\r\n\r\nthey  will  stay  at cheaper hotels in  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to address this visitor's transit\r\n\r\nproblem  and  encourage more visitors to stay  longer  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  Singapore Tourism Board should  provide\r\n\r\nmore incentives for organisations or firms to hold longer\r\n\r\nduration  international  conventions  or  exhibitions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We should also commission event promoters\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto bring in world-class shows, exhibitions or meetings to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a safe haven, Singapore should capitalise on its\r\n\r\nsecure environment to attract family visitors, especially\r\n\r\nchildren, to have fun in Singapore.  But to achieve this,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to have better tourist attractions for children\r\n\r\nand  families.  The Government should seriously  consider\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  world-class theme park, maybe a \"Wonderland\"\r\n\r\nor \"Dreamland for Children\".  We must invest and build  a\r\n\r\nworld-class   tourism  infrastructure  to   attract   new\r\n\r\ntourists to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed theme park should be supported by the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  be  competitively  priced  to   attract\r\n\r\nvisitors.   The Singapore Tourism Board should be  tasked\r\n\r\nto   operate   the   park  so  as   to   achieve   better\r\n\r\naccountability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the outsourcing of theme parks to the private\r\n\r\nsector has failed many times in Singapore.  We should not\r\n\r\nrepeat  these mistakes but should instead have  only  one\r\n\r\nworld-class   theme  park  in  Singapore.    Spearheading\r\n\r\ntourism will provide more business opportunities for  our\r\n\r\ncompanies in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Globalising Singapore</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to propose three strategies to globalise\r\n\r\nSingapore:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We have to focus on the quality and reliability\r\n\r\nof our products and services;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We must build a resilient and multi-skilled\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workforce; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We must nurture a few world-class companies to serve\r\n\r\nthe global market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(i)  Quality and Reliability</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As competition gets more intense, we must\r\n\r\ndifferentiate   our  products  and  services   from   our\r\n\r\ncompetitors.   Singapore  is  in  a  good   position   to\r\n\r\ncapitalise on our trustworthiness to produce good quality\r\n\r\nand reliable products and services.  We need to establish\r\n\r\nkey  benchmarks or performance indicators to measure  the\r\n\r\nacceptance of our services and products in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe global market.  More resources should be allocated to\r\n\r\nbrand Singapore's products and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the setting up of a Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee on Services.  To be a global player and tourism\r\n\r\nhub,  we  must  adopt a total approach to provide  world-class customer service.  In business, customer service is\r\n\r\nthe  key to retaining loyal customers and attracting  new\r\n\r\ncustomers.  We must make every effort to ensure that  all\r\n\r\ncustomers have good experience with Singapore's  products\r\n\r\nand  services.  One role model whom we can all follow  is\r\n\r\nSingapore Airlines.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.10 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(ii) Resilient and Multi-skilled Workforce</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with the fast changing global market\r\n\r\nconditions,  we  must have a resilient and  multi-skilled\r\n\r\nworkforce.   As businessmen are always very versatile  to\r\n\r\nreact  to  market forces, workers are often  caught  off-guard  to  adapt  to these changes.  Therefore,  we  must\r\n\r\ninstil  an  \"entrepreneurial mindset\" among our  workers.\r\n\r\nOur  workers must be capable to move in tandem  with  the\r\n\r\nmarket   forces  and  be  prepared  to  take   challenges\r\n\r\nconstantly.  As such, we should encourage firms to  adopt\r\n\r\njob  rotation  practices  and provide  opportunities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  employees  to  start businesses  such  as  forming\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries or business start-ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iii)     World-class companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not practical to groom all Singapore companies\r\n\r\nto  be  world-class.  We have to be selective and channel\r\n\r\nour  limited resources to nurture a few companies,  which\r\n\r\nare  promising.   The key support needed is  funding  for\r\n\r\nbusiness  ventures into the global market.  For a  start,\r\n\r\nthe Government can provide incentives for local banks  to\r\n\r\nreduce    their   stringent   requirements   for   credit\r\n\r\nfacilities.   Many banks require personal  guarantees  or\r\n\r\ncollaterals for business loans.  As such,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlimited  funding is available for local firms  to  expand\r\n\r\ntheir businesses overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government can also facilitate\r\n\r\npublic  listed  companies to raise  funds  through  share\r\n\r\nissues  for business expansion programmes.  With adequate\r\n\r\ncapital,  Singapore firms will be able to better position\r\n\r\nand compete in the global market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's Budget is a fair and balanced\r\n\r\nbudget.  It has the ingredients to prepare Singapore  for\r\n\r\nthe  future.   What is needed is a mindset  change  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  be more flexible, more hardworking  and\r\n\r\nmore  resourceful.   With  the strong  support  from  our\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Singapore will continue to  prosper  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  thank  you  for allowing me  to  join  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.    My   main   focus  would   be   on   enhancing\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, thereby helping Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is presented during a time when\r\n\r\nSingapore's economy is at a crossroad.  We are undergoing\r\n\r\na    structural   transformation   and   facing   greater\r\n\r\ncompetition due to rapid globalisation.  Ahead of us  are\r\n\r\nthe  uncertainties prevailing in major economies and  the\r\n\r\npossibility of war in Iraq.  This is a tough time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last couple of years, many Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nseverely affected by the economic downturn.  Many workers\r\n\r\nhave  lost  their jobs and finding it harder  to  be  re-employed.  Those in employment are very worried about job\r\n\r\nsecurity.   I will further elaborate on this  during  the\r\n\r\ndebate in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the message of seizing opportunity in\r\n\r\nuncertainty in Deputy Prime Minister's Budget  speech  is\r\n\r\ntimely,   given  the  current  situation.   The  measures\r\n\r\nproposed  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and   Finance\r\n\r\nMinister in his Budget speech to restructure our  economy\r\n\r\nare  crucial for our economic survival.  Some of them are\r\n\r\npainful, such as the deferment of CPF restoration, but  I\r\n\r\nunderstand why they are absolutely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  retaining  and attracting  businesses  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   These  will  create  good  jobs  and  ensure\r\n\r\ncontinued prosperity for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to elaborate on strengthening\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness for the creation of jobs and wealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about competitiveness and flexibility,\r\n\r\nwe  should not come to the immediate conclusion that  the\r\n\r\nonly factors are wages and labour costs.  Yes, wages  and\r\n\r\nlabour costs are significant, but there are other factors\r\n\r\nsuch  as land and related costs, regulatory and statutory\r\n\r\ncosts,  transportation, taxes and other  business  costs.\r\n\r\nLet me elaborate further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, wages and labour costs. We should continue\r\n\r\nto   maintain  labour  cost  competitiveness  and   raise\r\n\r\nproductivity.  We cannot just focus on cutting wages  and\r\n\r\nretrenching  workers.  We have to build up  the  flexible\r\n\r\nwage  component  in  our  wage system,  such  as  through\r\n\r\nmonthly  variable  components and variable  bonuses.   To\r\n\r\nsustain  employability of workers, wages must be directly\r\n\r\nlinked  to  productivity improvement.   I  strongly  urge\r\n\r\nemployers  to  involve  their  employees  in  efforts  to\r\n\r\nimprove productivity for mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, land and related costs. Are high land costs\r\n\r\nand  other  factors  making Singapore uncompetitive?   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  further  explore whether the land  pricing  and\r\n\r\nother  related costs are artificially high  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand not adhering to current market factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, regulatory and statutory costs. As a union\r\n\r\nleader, I have come across concerns from businesses  that\r\n\r\nregulatory and compliance costs on companies are high  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   These  have  affected  businesses  and   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   Will more steps be  taken  to  address\r\n\r\nthese concerns?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister\r\n\r\nhas announced a number of measures to make it attractive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor businesses to invest in Singapore.  At the same time,\r\n\r\nhe  has  announced  various rebates  and  reductions  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses until year's end.  Would it not be  better  if\r\n\r\nsuch  rebates  and  reductions are extended  for  another\r\n\r\nthree  years?   Further, why not freeze  all  other  cost\r\n\r\nincreases  at the same time for another three  years?   I\r\n\r\nbelieve   all   these  suggestions  will   greatly   help\r\n\r\nbusinesses in Singapore and attract new ones, which  will\r\n\r\nresult  in  the  preservation and creation  of  jobs  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Retrenchments can be  minimised  and  not\r\n\r\nmake  the unemployment situation worse.  This will  boost\r\n\r\nthe confidence level of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancing human capital. I applaud Government's\r\n\r\nmove to set up a new statutory board under MOM to promote\r\n\r\nadult   continuing  education  and  training.   The   new\r\n\r\nstatutory board will oversee our continuing education and\r\n\r\ntraining  efforts.   The details of the  statutory  board\r\n\r\nhave not been announced, but I would like to see the  new\r\n\r\nstatutory board addressing the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Enhance the employability of older workers who have\r\n\r\nmainly  knowledge  in job-specific or technology-specific\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Help workers make career switches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Continual learning and skills upgrading for\r\n\r\nprofessionals, executives and self-employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Help the structurally unemployed gain new skills and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Manage a database of important information emerging\r\n\r\nfrom  the  rapid  structural changes.  This  will  ensure\r\n\r\noptimum investment in training and retraining, so  as  to\r\n\r\nenhance  workers'  employability  and  help  them   adapt\r\n\r\nquickly to changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Strengthen synergies with other important partners\r\n\r\nsuch  as  EDB,  NTUC,  SNEF, and  others.   These  strong\r\n\r\nsynergies  will help identify the type of  skills  needed\r\n\r\nfor  the  jobs that new investments will bring  and  help\r\n\r\nprepare workers through training and skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the concerted efforts of all partners working\r\n\r\nin   tandem  with  the  new  statutory  board,   we   can\r\n\r\ncollectively and confidently address the issues of skills\r\n\r\ngap, wage gap and structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, during this period of\r\n\r\nuncertainty and tight budget position, the initiatives by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  help  Singaporeans,  especially  the\r\n\r\npoorer  ones, must be lauded.  The measures would lighten\r\n\r\nthe  load  of Singaporeans.  Assistance such as Utilities\r\n\r\nSave  and  additional S&C rebates will help  workers  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   The additional allocation  of  funds  for\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment Programme, Lifelong  Learning  Fund\r\n\r\nand  Medifund  are  steps in the right direction.   Taken\r\n\r\ntogether  with the earlier announcements of ERS  and  the\r\n\r\nphased-in  introduction of GST, there is  no  doubt  that\r\n\r\nthere is help available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These various assistance schemes clearly show that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is committed to its social contract  with\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore.  For the future,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to continue to target more help to  the  most\r\n\r\nneedy,   the   unemployed,  the  poorer  or   unfortunate\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and their families.  I suggest  an  opt-out\r\n\r\ndonation  mechanism  to  a  central  hardship   fund   be\r\n\r\nexplored, so that better-off Singaporeans can donate  the\r\n\r\nshares or benefits granted by the Government to those  in\r\n\r\ngreater need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the challenges ahead of us are\r\n\r\nformidable, one of the most difficult facing  our  nation\r\n\r\nsince independence.  In the past, we have worked together\r\n\r\nand remained focused on our objectives.  This has led  to\r\n\r\ncontinuous growth and prosperity for all of us.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  approach  we must continue to take.  We  must  never\r\n\r\nallow  minor  problems or even setbacks  to  distract  or\r\n\r\ndiscourage us.  The greatest welfare to people  is  jobs.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  strongly urge the Government to do  all  that  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  preservation and creation  of  jobs.\r\n\r\nPolicies to bring about this should be implemented fairly\r\n\r\nand  humanely, especially to those who are affected most.\r\n\r\nTogether, let us seize the opportunity in uncertainty and\r\n\r\nstrive for a better Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  like  many of the hon.  Members  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber, I would like to join in the debate on the Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  delivered  by the Deputy  Prime  Minister  and\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.  I hope to give my perspective  and\r\n\r\nviews  on the matter and, at the same time, give feedback\r\n\r\non views that I got from the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stand here before you today, I can safely say\r\n\r\nthat  I do not recall a period where the nation has faced\r\n\r\ngreater  uncertainty.  The seemingly  inevitable  war  in\r\n\r\nIraq and the performance of the regional and US economies\r\n\r\nwill  pose serious challenges for us.  In fact, they  are\r\n\r\nalready  affecting us.  Indeed, we are  facing  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.  The waves that we have to ride may grow in  size.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not  know.   Therefore, we can only  do  what  is\r\n\r\nhumanly possible to stay prepared and survive this period\r\n\r\nin our nation's life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that fellow Singaporeans are very familiar\r\n\r\nwith the way the Government works.  Our approach in times\r\n\r\nlike this is almost predictable.  It is simple.  We study\r\n\r\nthe  problem at hand and we seek solutions.   Often,  the\r\n\r\nway out is not a breeze.  It is usually painful.  But  we\r\n\r\ngo  to  our  people and work with them.   Retrospectively\r\n\r\nspeaking,  we  have been fortunate that  they  understand\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is  necessary to grit our teeth  as  a  nation,\r\n\r\npersevere and patiently wait for the storm to blow  over.\r\n\r\nMore  often  than not, the fruits of our  policy  changes\r\n\r\nemerge after several years.  History has shown that  they\r\n\r\nare not immediate.  It is this lag period which many find\r\n\r\nexcruciating, and no amount of explanation  will  appease\r\n\r\nthe man-in-the-street who bears the brunt of the economic\r\n\r\nslowdown  and, on top of that, the additional  blow  from\r\n\r\npolicy changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent increase in job losses, the highest\r\n\r\nunemployment rate since 1986, and the daily war  rhetoric\r\n\r\nare  all  very disheartening.  As a nation, we have  also\r\n\r\nrecently  been  plagued by a series of  freak  accidents,\r\n\r\nbeginning with the Pedra\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBranca  tragedy  and  a  few  others.   We  are  terribly\r\n\r\nsaddened  by  the  loss  of  innocent  lives  amidst  the\r\n\r\neconomic and geo-political uncertainties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Budget 2003 is really a continuation of Budget\r\n\r\n2002,   the   global  situation  has  since   last   year\r\n\r\ndeteriorated,  and our people need more hope  than  ever.\r\n\r\nHope,  hope and more hope are my mantra these days.   The\r\n\r\nbelief  that  this too, like most things  in  life,  will\r\n\r\npass, holds true.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope it is obvious to many that Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds  to  embark  on a different path  where  individual\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  will  propel  the  economy  while   the\r\n\r\ncountry   is  on  the  path  of  consolidation.   Private\r\n\r\nenterprise  must be encouraged, engineered even  for  the\r\n\r\nsake of growth.  If this is indeed the direction that  we\r\n\r\nhave  charted for Singapore, are we willing to  seriously\r\n\r\nassist  our  start-ups in every sense of  the  word,  and\r\n\r\nsincerely  provide  infrastructure  and  financial   aid?\r\n\r\nSupporting  them  is  inevitably  part  of  a   conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment  that we need to create.  How  do  we  create\r\n\r\nrisk  takers  when the predominant culture is  to  always\r\n\r\nensure certainty, back-up plans after back-up plans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the call by Dr John Chen and other Members\r\n\r\nthat  our  civil  service officers should  be  more  pro-business  and act as advocates for companies  and  start-ups, rather than just apply rules and uphold regulations.\r\n\r\nIt  will  certainly help to smoothen the flow of requests\r\n\r\nand  applications and reduce wastage of time  and  money.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  Sir, the changing of mindsets is  the  greatest\r\n\r\nchallenge at hand.  I am glad that more support is  being\r\n\r\nallocated,  and  the  Minister of  State  for  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  Mr Raymond Lim, has eloquently spelt  out  his\r\n\r\nvision  and mission towards this effort.  My hope is  for\r\n\r\nhim  to  listen to the industry players and stakeholders.\r\n\r\nVery  often,  I  hear people lamenting  that  the  policy\r\n\r\nmakers  are  oblivious of happenings on the  ground  when\r\n\r\nthey  are  churning out policies, schemes and  programmes\r\n\r\nthat are supposedly intended to help the companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the present economic\r\n\r\nclimate  and  challenges  that  face  the  country,   the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community must continue to strive along.  It\r\n\r\nis  definitely not easy for all Singaporeans, but  it  is\r\n\r\nalso commonly known that the majority of the Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\nworkers  are  in  the lower-income and  the  lower-skills\r\n\r\ncategory.    If  the  economic  slowdown  persists,   the\r\n\r\ncommunity will naturally be hit by retrenchments and loss\r\n\r\nof  jobs.  But this does not mean that we should just lie\r\n\r\ndown and consider ourselves defeated.  Instead, we should\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity  to  improve  and  upgrade.   The\r\n\r\ncommunity must take these challenges and face them,  just\r\n\r\nlike all the other difficulties that they have faced  and\r\n\r\novercome  in  the past.  We should continue to  focus  on\r\n\r\neducation and the vision of a community of excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young and the youths of the community are doing\r\n\r\nbetter.   Similarly, the Malay/Muslim  organisations  and\r\n\r\nNGOs  have  done  quite a commendable  job  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nproviding   accessibility  to  resource  and  assistance.\r\n\r\nHowever, the journey surely cannot end here.  They should\r\n\r\ncontinue to work closely with the Government agencies and\r\n\r\nother   self-help  groups  to  continue  to  uplift   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long run, we all agree that handouts\r\n\r\nneed  to  be reduced.  We do not intend to be  a  welfare\r\n\r\nstate.  However, having said that, addressing real  needs\r\n\r\nis  part  of  our commitment to care for our people,  and\r\n\r\nthis  deserves our full attention.  Health cost is a real\r\n\r\nproblem  to three categories worth mentioning  here:  the\r\n\r\nsenior citizens and retirees with chronic illnesses,  the\r\n\r\nhandicapped  and the unemployed.  Not all  companies  can\r\n\r\nafford  to  provide healthcare, post retrenchment.   Some\r\n\r\nmay, but are not motivated or required to do so.  This is\r\n\r\na problem and needs to be looked into seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the arts carry very little\r\n\r\nweight to the average Singaporean.  This area of interest\r\n\r\nis  not perceived as a serious subject.  At best,  it  is\r\n\r\nlimited to a favourite pastime.  I know many parents  who\r\n\r\nsend their children for piano or violin lessons with  the\r\n\r\ncontention\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the stimulation helps their children to perform well\r\n\r\nin mathematics and science instead.  Perhaps, there is  a\r\n\r\nneurological  link.   Credible  or  not  is  not  to   be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  here,  but my point is that the  mentality  at\r\n\r\nlarge  does not regard the arts very highly.  I am  often\r\n\r\nworried  and concerned that in these difficult times  the\r\n\r\nsupport  and  resources  for arts  and  culture  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced.   However,  thankfully, our hearts  are  at  the\r\n\r\nright  places, and the cultural achievements in 2002  are\r\n\r\nvery  encouraging.  It presents concrete steps to  change\r\n\r\nperceptions and mould different opinions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus heartening to note that we will continue\r\n\r\non  our  pursuit  of  creating  a  cultural  capital  and\r\n\r\nboosting  our arts scene and industry, as recommended  by\r\n\r\nthe  ERC.   The  economic  and social  potential  of  our\r\n\r\ncultural capital cannot be denied, and the ERC recognises\r\n\r\nthis  fact.  I certainly believe that, as we develop  and\r\n\r\ngrow as a young country, these aspects of our development\r\n\r\nshould   not  be  neglected.   Let  us  not  choose   the\r\n\r\nconvenient  and  so-called  obvious  choice  of   cutting\r\n\r\nexpenditures in this area and, thus, bringing us back  in\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of continuous learning and upgrading\r\n\r\nin  all  areas cannot be emphasised enough.  Our  schools\r\n\r\nand  institutes of higher learning are intricately linked\r\n\r\nwith  our  chief engines of growth.  The formation  of  a\r\n\r\nstatutory board to focus on this area is laudable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would propose to this new\r\n\r\norganisation   to  try  and  leverage  on  the   existing\r\n\r\ninstitutions and bodies, and streamline the  schemes  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that could further encourage and  incentivise\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning.  Our workers are worried  that,  even\r\n\r\nafter  picking  up new skills and knowledge,  they  still\r\n\r\ncannot  improve their chances of getting  new  jobs.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to address this concern clearly.  Beyond that,  our\r\n\r\ntertiary  institutions must continue to  remain  relevant\r\n\r\nand  serve  not  only the student cohorts  but  also  the\r\n\r\nworking  adults  who  yearn to upgrade  themselves.   Our\r\n\r\nuniversities  need  to  be  relevant,  and   the   recent\r\n\r\nuniversity review was timely.  They need to work  closely\r\n\r\nwith industries and look at feedback seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the kind of graduates that we are\r\n\r\nproducing  at our universities.  Can our graduates  think\r\n\r\nfor  themselves?  During the recent student dialogue with\r\n\r\nour Senior Minister, the criticism was that the questions\r\n\r\nwere   mainly   from   foreign  students,   whereas   the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans were often silent.  Are they simply  shy  to\r\n\r\nask  or  are  they complacent, contented  to  simply  sit\r\n\r\ncomfortably   and  absorb  without  doing  more   serious\r\n\r\nthinking?  Are they independent?  Can they cope with  not\r\n\r\nbeing able to find a job immediately after they graduate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, going back to the current situation that faces\r\n\r\nthe  nation, my last word on this is that we need to work\r\n\r\ntogether  and help our people to get out of the doldrums.\r\n\r\nThe retrenched may actually find themselves employed in a\r\n\r\nshorter  period, if some things are put into perspective.\r\n\r\nOften  enough, we hear of jobs and opportunities  in  the\r\n\r\nservice industry, but they are not well regarded and thus\r\n\r\nthe  take-up  rate  is slow.  It is time  we  started  to\r\n\r\nchange  mindsets and prejudices towards jobs and  careers\r\n\r\nin the service industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who are considering to go into this\r\n\r\nindustry, let me give this small piece of advice which  I\r\n\r\npicked  up from a movie that I watched over the  weekend.\r\n\r\nThere was this very professional and dignified butler who\r\n\r\nsaid, wisely:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To serve people takes dignity and intelligence, but\r\n\r\nremember,  they are just people with money.  Although  we\r\n\r\nserve  them, we are not their servants.  What we do  does\r\n\r\nnot  define who we are.  What defines us is how  we  rise\r\n\r\nafter falling.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that every Singaporean would remember this.\r\n\r\n<br>4.28 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be applauded that in spite of a difficult\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  much  pressure  to  implement  populist\r\n\r\nmeasures,  the  Government has  come  out  with  a  clear\r\n\r\nroadmap that will take us to the next lap to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe a global, entrepreneurial and diversified economy, one\r\n\r\nthat  will  be well-positioned to take on the competition\r\n\r\nand  challenges  posed by mega-cities around  the  world.\r\n\r\nRather   than  manage  just  for  the  short  term,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has decided to take measures  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nlong-term survival of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  my mind, that we would succeed to remake Singapore to\r\n\r\nbe  an  attractive  place  to  work  and  play  for  both\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and foreigners, is without doubt.  Three and\r\n\r\na half decades ago, Singapore was in a worse position - a\r\n\r\npoorer background and devoid of the many advantages  that\r\n\r\nwe  have today.  While today's competition is stiffer, we\r\n\r\nhave  also  progressed much in terms of  being  a  better\r\n\r\norganised country with world-class infrastructure.   Just\r\n\r\nas  the  Senior Minister of State, Mr Khaw Boon Wan,  has\r\n\r\nsaid, we are a fertile ground that would be nourished  by\r\n\r\ntoday's  rain.  But we are also pragmatic and  hard-nosed\r\n\r\nenough to take the bitter medicine required at each stage\r\n\r\nof our growth.  Nowhere else is a country's leadership so\r\n\r\nforthright and bold enough to be upfront on the need  for\r\n\r\nretrenchments,  that  they are a necessary  part  of  the\r\n\r\nsolution needed to meet stiffer competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchments alone are not sufficient. We need\r\n\r\nmeasures to take care of the lower strata of society, and\r\n\r\nto  prepare  them  to contribute positively  in  the  new\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  am  pleased that  we  would  have  a  new\r\n\r\nstatutory  board  set  up  to  look  at  retraining   and\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities and placements.  Job creation is\r\n\r\nkey.   Singapore  would  need  to  find  new  value-added\r\n\r\nactivities  that are either generated in the  country  or\r\n\r\nattracted from abroad.  The many FTAs that have been  put\r\n\r\nin  place  since  the last budget debate  will  certainly\r\n\r\nhelp,  and  they  will give much comfort to  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat this Government plans and executes well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the many measures being put in place, there is\r\n\r\nno  doubt  that  Singapore would be  well-placed  with  a\r\n\r\nsignificant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrole  in  the  world  and the region.   With  first-class\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and  value-added  manpower,  it  is   not\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  imagine  several  years  from   now   when\r\n\r\nSingapore will have a vibrant movie industry, a hotbed of\r\n\r\nR&D activities, that it will be an indispensable node  in\r\n\r\nthe  world of network finance and a key hub through which\r\n\r\ntangible  and  intangible services flow  efficiently  and\r\n\r\nseamlessly through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as we all know, everything eventually hinges on\r\n\r\nconfidence.  While we hope to be a linchpin in a thriving\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia, it would be too hopeful to think that the\r\n\r\nthreat of terrorism would subside anytime soon.  While we\r\n\r\nyearn  for  a peaceful world, we must not let  our  guard\r\n\r\ndown.   The  very ingredients of our success  make  us  a\r\n\r\nchoice target.  The fact that we succeed as a key cog  in\r\n\r\nthe  world machinery will make us a natural target.   So,\r\n\r\nwhile  we keep a sharp eye on the fiscal position of  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  it is imperative that we invest enough  in  our\r\n\r\nhomeland   security  in  order  to  deter   anyone   with\r\n\r\nintentions  to inflict harm on our citizens and  to  dent\r\n\r\neconomic confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear with much comfort the measures we have\r\n\r\nundertaken  in  being  the first to  participate  in  the\r\n\r\ncontainer  security initiative, a key  node  in  the  so-called Green Lane.  There is also further confidence that\r\n\r\nwe  read of the gamma ray machines and the focus that are\r\n\r\nbeing  brought  to  bear  at  the  new  Immigration   and\r\n\r\nCheckpoints Authority.  However, I believe that it  would\r\n\r\ndo  us  well  to be doing even more.  We need to  further\r\n\r\nreinforce  the  confidence of  our  people  and  external\r\n\r\ninvestors.   We  must stand out from  our  neighbours  as\r\n\r\nbeing  ahead  in the area of security and vigilance.   We\r\n\r\nmust  be  the  bedrock of stability in this part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking just beyond our shores, we are beginning to\r\n\r\ndevelop   Bintan  and  Batam  as  part  of  our  economic\r\n\r\nhinterland.   They feature in our FTAs.   We  should  now\r\n\r\nextend  our  security  measures and  procedures  to  this\r\n\r\nextended hinterland as well, so that they become part  of\r\n\r\nour  security  eco-system.  With  greater  confidence  in\r\n\r\nthese two islands, investors would no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoubt  be more convinced and motivated to plant the  more\r\n\r\nlabour-intensive factories there, while  using  Singapore\r\n\r\nas their logistics and management centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For expatriates, the security of their families is\r\n\r\noften paramount.  More so for those who make Singapore as\r\n\r\ntheir  launch pad and spend most of their time travelling\r\n\r\nin  the  region.   Peace of mind would  definitely  drive\r\n\r\ntheir  choice of location.  For the investors who  decide\r\n\r\non  the location of their multi-million-dollar plants and\r\n\r\nare  reliant  on  these  to  be  sole  suppliers  of  key\r\n\r\ncomponents    and   processed   materials,    Singapore's\r\n\r\ncommitment to homeland security to reduce even the remote\r\n\r\npossibility of a catastrophic event would definitely be a\r\n\r\nswing factor in their investment decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our people, especially those who have\r\n\r\nexperienced  the  lack  of civic safety  in  other  major\r\n\r\nconcentrations of population, we understand too well that\r\n\r\nour  safe  environment cannot be taken for  granted.   We\r\n\r\nmust  draw  upon  all our resources  to  tackle  the  new\r\n\r\nterrorist threats.  The issue of social cohesion had been\r\n\r\nwell debated during the debate on the White Paper on  the\r\n\r\nthreat of terrorism.  But I wish to add that strengthened\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion must be supported by reinforced security\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  Terrorists, like water, seek the path of\r\n\r\nleast  resistance.   But  we are already  ahead  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.   We  are probably one of the most IT-savvy  and\r\n\r\nwired-up   islands  where  pockets  of  good  information\r\n\r\ntechnologies  are  under  the jurisdiction  of  different\r\n\r\nagencies  and Ministries.  The next step is to  have  all\r\n\r\nthese  agencies  connected up,  sharing  information  and\r\n\r\nsharing  learning.  The fact that we are a  small  island\r\n\r\nmakes this task even easier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar analogy is the rationale for the setting\r\n\r\nup of the credit bureau in the financial industry.  Prior\r\n\r\nto  this, each bank has its own information, but this  is\r\n\r\nnot  shared.   The sharing of critical information  on  a\r\n\r\ncommon platform now results in a better outcome for  all.\r\n\r\nToday,  technology  allows  us  such  sharing  of   data,\r\n\r\ninformation and experience on a broad-based basis on end,\r\n\r\neven instantaneously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we have strong ministerial overview on\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and services, I hope we  will  likewise\r\n\r\nstrongly consider having an overview on homeland security\r\n\r\non a ministerial level.  There must be a strong concerted\r\n\r\nand  focused effort by drawing upon all the agencies that\r\n\r\nstraddle different jurisdictions and a determined  effort\r\n\r\nat  wiring  up  and  strengthening  our  island  and  its\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.     The   mission    requires    resource\r\n\r\ncoordination, tracking, quick identification and  precise\r\n\r\nresponse, often in very compressed timeframes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security agencies must be given the tools to get\r\n\r\nthis  job done and done well.  The economic agencies  and\r\n\r\nthe  security  agencies  would  debate  on  how  much  is\r\n\r\naffordable  and  whether it would increase  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ndoing  business.  But I would contend that  security  and\r\n\r\nefforts   to  enhance  personal  security  and   business\r\n\r\ncontinuity  make good business sense for the people,  for\r\n\r\nthe Government and for the business community.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the people would not want us to be stingy on issues\r\n\r\nof security.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you for allowing me to join in the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few years, as we encounter the same\r\n\r\nissues  as  other developed economies, we will  face  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  the lowly-educated workers who have  limited\r\n\r\nskill  sets.   They may become our long-term  unemployed.\r\n\r\nWe   need   to  think  of  ways  to  help  them,  without\r\n\r\nencouraging  them  to just sit back and  collect  welfare\r\n\r\npayouts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we think of ways to encourage them to earn at\r\n\r\nleast  whatever  they can earn?  For example,  additional\r\n\r\nhelp  with  school fees for an extended period  that  our\r\n\r\ngrassroots and Government agencies might offer  could  be\r\n\r\ncontingent  on  the  unemployed  head  of  the  household\r\n\r\naccepting  at  least a job, even if after accepting  this\r\n\r\njob the family would still need some additional financial\r\n\r\nhelp,  eg,  with  education of the children.   Those  who\r\n\r\nconsistently turn down job matches that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  CDC  provides could then be given the least priority\r\n\r\nfor extended help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to touch on is about\r\n\r\nencouraging  an entrepreneurial culture.  Some  of  these\r\n\r\nunemployed  would  also be white-collar  workers.   While\r\n\r\nindividuals  may  feel unsure of becoming  entrepreneurs,\r\n\r\ncommunity centres or other agencies could also help  them\r\n\r\nto  meet, after the manner of the Social Development Unit\r\n\r\n(SDU),  so  that they can network and form syndicates  of\r\n\r\npeople with complementary skill sets and who could either\r\n\r\nthen  strike out on their own as a group or seek  venture\r\n\r\ncapital  to get jobs overseas.  Recently, in the  papers,\r\n\r\nthere was a group of people who had done just that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the SDU has arguably been successful in\r\n\r\ngetting  people to meet partners of the opposite sex,  an\r\n\r\norganisation, eg, an Entrepreneurial Development  Unit  - to  coin a phrase - could provide opportunities for like-minded  people who happen to be professionals, or  people\r\n\r\nwho  have  marketing skills, or even people who have  had\r\n\r\ntechnical training from various statutory boards, such as\r\n\r\nPSA,  etc, to get started together to talk to each  other\r\n\r\nand,  perhaps,  to  listen to motivational  speakers  who\r\n\r\nthemselves  have started a business, about  opportunities\r\n\r\nelsewhere, eg, in neighbouring countries, and  those  who\r\n\r\nshare  a common vision might start a company in someone's\r\n\r\nflat and, who knows, one day, this could be another Apple\r\n\r\nor Microsoft.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members might ask on what basis I make these\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  I have never started a commercial  company,\r\n\r\nbut   I   have   helped  to  start  up  one  professional\r\n\r\nassociation,  two  NGO  organisations  and  two   service\r\n\r\ncentres,  both  in Singapore and in the region.   In  all\r\n\r\nthese  cases,  these projects took off because,  firstly,\r\n\r\nthere  was  an  opportunity for people to  discuss  these\r\n\r\nideas  socially.   The people who discussed  these  ideas\r\n\r\nbelieved  in  them,  believed  that  they  would  benefit\r\n\r\npeople, and decided to run with the idea over a period of\r\n\r\ntime, overcoming obstacles along the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kandang Kerbau Hospital in 1998, a small group of\r\n\r\nstaff   from  different  professional  disciplines   also\r\n\r\nbrainstormed, developed and patented a small device which\r\n\r\nwe  still use now for all children in KK Hospital.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure   that   Members  of  the  House  here,   who   have\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  started  businesses,  would  have   similar\r\n\r\nexamples in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that Singaporeans are as capable and\r\n\r\ninnovative as anyone else in the world.  We just need  to\r\n\r\ndare  to dream, to share our dreams, and believe that  we\r\n\r\ncan achieve these dreams, if we also dare to fail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to another point - about whether we\r\n\r\nwould  be  penny wise and pound foolish in  some  of  the\r\n\r\nthings that we do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the HDB miracle of\r\n\r\naffordable   modern  homes  for  most   Singaporeans   be\r\n\r\nsustained?   Will  our clean and tidy  neighbourhoods  be\r\n\r\nalso  clean  and  tidy in five years'  time,  if  we  see\r\n\r\nincreasing  numbers  of citizens  with  power  and  water\r\n\r\nsupplies  cut off?  While there may be good  reasons  why\r\n\r\nthis  has to be done, it could be that these people would\r\n\r\neventually  live  in squalor and lack modern  sanitation,\r\n\r\neven  within our modern HDB townships.  How can  we  help\r\n\r\nthem?   How  can  we  ensure that we will  not  get  many\r\n\r\nghettoes  within  our sparkling city?  Could  we  not  be\r\n\r\ninnovative and have maybe a small timer switch that would\r\n\r\nallow  just enough electricity to run lights between  the\r\n\r\nevening  hours  when children need to do  their  homework\r\n\r\nand,  perhaps,  in  order to ensure  sanitation,  that  a\r\n\r\nthimble  or  some other mechanism might be found  to  let\r\n\r\nwater  supplies be given at low-flow rates, again in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of public safety?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that Singapore Power is now a\r\n\r\ncommercial  entity,  but we should also  consider  public\r\n\r\nhealth  and  decency.  It would not be  helpful  for  our\r\n\r\nschool  children  to  go  to school  spreading  lice  and\r\n\r\ninfectious  diseases that used to be  seen  only  in  the\r\n\r\nkampungs  of old.  A dishevelled worker, unable to  bathe\r\n\r\nfor several days,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  also  find great difficulty convincing a  would-be\r\n\r\nemployer to employ him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nstrongly  support the increase in tobacco duties.   As  a\r\n\r\ndoctor, I am convinced that smoking is clearly linked  to\r\n\r\ncancer,  heart  disease, blockage of  blood  vessels  and\r\n\r\nother   medical  ills.   The  downside  of   smoking   is\r\n\r\ntremendous.  The only upside is fiduciary.  And, even so,\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I doubt that the increased  tax\r\n\r\nrevenue  could exceed the cost of increased medical  care\r\n\r\nneeds  and  social costs of smoking.  While the loopholes\r\n\r\nin the cigarette size and length have been plugged by the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, I  still\r\n\r\nhear of young people banding together to share a pack  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes.   It  is  a difficult  loophole.   But  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that the Minister will find a way to plug  this\r\n\r\none  as  well.   Perhaps, there ought to  be  a  COE  for\r\n\r\ncigarettes!  The arguments for smokers to bear a  greater\r\n\r\nburden  of the true social cost for smoking are  no  less\r\n\r\nstrong than the arguments for road users!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, support for tax incentives to relocate\r\n\r\nforeign  talent.  I strongly support these moves to  make\r\n\r\nit more financially attractive to locate talent and skill\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  be  they foreign or  previously  resident\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    Our  property  market,  retail   sector,\r\n\r\nentertainment  sector, and even the little  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nshops  and  eateries,  are  suffering  from  a  lack   of\r\n\r\nclientele.   Singapore needs a certain critical  mass  to\r\n\r\nachieve this cosmopolitan buzz, and talented people, with\r\n\r\ntheir generally greater spending power, will make a great\r\n\r\ndifference  to the local economy.  Can we  also  make  it\r\n\r\neasier  for these people to live in and perhaps  own  the\r\n\r\nbigger   and  less  affordable  -  at  least  to  current\r\n\r\nSingaporeans - HDB flats?  I would also say that allowing\r\n\r\nthese  people  perhaps lower tax rates may still  benefit\r\n\r\nus,  provided that the money is kept in Singapore and not\r\n\r\nrepatriated back home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the statements by my fellow MPs to ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  consider to continue with rental  rebates\r\n\r\nfor  JTC  and HDB commercial tenants for a longer period.\r\n\r\nHowever, like Dr John Chen, I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  argue that with a situation of soft demand,  where\r\n\r\ninvestors  are weighing carefully the pros  and  cons  of\r\n\r\nlocating  new  investments, we should  take  an  approach\r\n\r\nwhere  we would adopt fixed rates or lower rentals for  a\r\n\r\nlonger  period of two or even three years.  Our  emphasis\r\n\r\nshould  really  be  on  making  the  sale  and  making  a\r\n\r\nprospective investor sign on the dotted line.  The effect\r\n\r\nof  having predictable fixed costs for rentals cannot  be\r\n\r\nunder-estimated, given our generally high cost structure.\r\n\r\nAgain,  the  knock-on effects of a hollowing out  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  industrial base are tremendous.  Even if factories\r\n\r\nwill come for the next three years, they may be persuaded\r\n\r\nto stay.  If they do not come at all, we will not get the\r\n\r\nchance   to  renovate  their  premises,  sell  them   new\r\n\r\ncomputers  and  create jobs for our workers  even  as  we\r\n\r\nretool and remake our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I am strongly in support of the\r\n\r\nincentives  for  uptake  of  industrial  land  with  long\r\n\r\nleaseholds, as has been announced.  I also hope that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will also make some lands available  at  short\r\n\r\nleaseholds  to make it more affordable for businesses  to\r\n\r\nset  up  shop  and have a lower entry hurdle,  especially\r\n\r\nwhere  they  think they can make their money  back  in  a\r\n\r\nshorter  period  of  time.  For example,  big  electronic\r\n\r\nfactories have been known to locate and even relocate  in\r\n\r\nvery,  very short time-frames.  Nevertheless, we  benefit\r\n\r\nwhen  investors do come to set up shop. At least  we  get\r\n\r\nthe chance to persuade them to stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join  in  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM and Finance Minister announced in his Budget\r\n\r\nStatement the five long-term strategies to make Singapore\r\n\r\na  leading global city and immediate measures to help our\r\n\r\neconomy to recover from the recession.  He cautioned that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no safe harbour where our ship can shelter  to\r\n\r\nrebuild  and refit before heading out to sea.   All  work\r\n\r\nmust  be  done  on  board ship while we are  sailing  and\r\n\r\nbattling the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelements.  As more disheartening economic data from major\r\n\r\neconomies  like the US, Germany and Japan  were  released\r\n\r\nand the acrimonious debate at the UN Security Council  on\r\n\r\nIraq revealed a great political divide, the elements that\r\n\r\nour  ship is battling are fast becoming a perfect  storm.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not  make  our immediate future  prospect  look\r\n\r\noptimistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set against this background, the 2003 Budget is a\r\n\r\npractical  and  a  reasonable  one.   It  does  not  meet\r\n\r\neveryone's  wish  but it gives where  it  is  needed  and\r\n\r\nmatters  most.   The $900 million deficit is  significant\r\n\r\nafter  running  a  deficit for the last  two  years.   To\r\n\r\naddress the concern that not enough has been done to help\r\n\r\nthe people who are in need as well as to help the economy\r\n\r\nto  recover  should the economy worsen, I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will come forward with subsequent  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures quickly if it becomes necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to note that the Government will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to extend help to those of our fellow  citizens\r\n\r\nwho are most affected by the recession.  They deserve our\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many in the business community, while disappointed\r\n\r\nthat  the  much anticipated corporate tax  cut  will  not\r\n\r\nmaterialise  this year are, however, reassured  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would likely reduce the current corporate  tax\r\n\r\nfrom  22%  to  20%  for  the  Year  of  Assessment  2005.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  think  we should avoid the Hongkong  example\r\n\r\nwhere  the  substantial budget deficit of  HK$70  billion\r\n\r\nthis  year  necessitates  an increase  in  corporate  and\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax.  Hongkong has announced an increase\r\n\r\nof  1.5%  increase  in corporate tax  to  17.5%,  and  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of 1% in personal income tax to 16% to  support\r\n\r\nits budget deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's commitment to continue to help\r\n\r\nreduce  business cost, simplify its rules and  procedures\r\n\r\nand  cut  red  tape and for the Ministries and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  to avoid crowding out the private sector are  all\r\n\r\nnecessary measures in the remaking of our economy.  An\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial and innovative bureaucracy will also help\r\n\r\nto  support  our businesses and entrepreneurs.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that there could also be greater  inter-agency  cooperation  so  that policies  and  measures  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  Ministries would be harmonised  and  conflicts\r\n\r\nminimised. The business community has long viewed tax  on\r\n\r\nforeign  income remitted into Singapore a sacred  cow  as\r\n\r\nrepeated  recommendations and suggestions  for  exemption\r\n\r\nwere  rejected. The move to exempt tax on foreign  income\r\n\r\nremittance  is,  in  fact,  very  well-received.   It  is\r\n\r\nsignificant   not  just  in  monetary  terms   but   also\r\n\r\nsymbolically  it  represents a change of  mindset  and  a\r\n\r\nparadigm  shift.  It is a pro-business decision  and  one\r\n\r\nthat the ERC has also recommended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move to exempt domestic interest income to\r\n\r\nindividuals  derived  from  savings,  current  and  fixed\r\n\r\ndeposit  accounts is also most welcomed.   Companies  who\r\n\r\nup  to  now  keep foreign income offshore and individuals\r\n\r\nwho  keep deposits out of Singapore for tax reasons  will\r\n\r\nnow  find no barriers in bringing them back to Singapore.\r\n\r\nAll  Singaporeans should indeed take heed of the call  to\r\n\r\npull together to tide over this difficult period and move\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Korea, one of the worst hit economies during\r\n\r\nthe  1997 Asian economic crisis, made an amazing recovery\r\n\r\nand remains as one of the world's most resilient economy,\r\n\r\nwith  some of the world's most admired companies such  as\r\n\r\nSamsung and LG.  During the 1997 crisis, South Korea  had\r\n\r\nto  be built up by IMF with a loan of US$50 billion.   In\r\n\r\nan  amazing recovery story, South Korean economy grew  by\r\n\r\n9.3% in the year 2000, 3% in 2001 and 6.2% in 2002.   The\r\n\r\nSouth  Korean people are hardworking. They can  endure  a\r\n\r\nlot  of hardships.  They have a 'never say die' attitude.\r\n\r\nThey tighten their belts to support the Government during\r\n\r\ntheir  crisis.  I can still remember vividly reports  and\r\n\r\nimages  in  newspapers and television on  news  of  South\r\n\r\nKorean  women  queuing up to contribute  their  gold  and\r\n\r\njewellery  to  help  the economy.  I think  such  is  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of the South Korean people and such is the spirit\r\n\r\nthat we must cultivate for our Singaporeans.  This is  an\r\n\r\narea we must\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuild  on  -  the  resilience  of  our  economy  and  the\r\n\r\nresilience of our people.  I think  Singaporeans can also\r\n\r\nmake  it. We can be like another South Korea.  And I look\r\n\r\nforward  to the difficult voyage ahead with optimism  and\r\n\r\nhope.   I  know  as  a country and as a people,  we  will\r\n\r\nsurvive this perfect storm and survive well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion in the name  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance. This is an  apt  and  timely\r\n\r\nBudget.  For the 1-room to 5-room flat owners, they  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to enjoy the utilities and S&C rebates.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, everyone will benefit from the additional $100\r\n\r\nmillion paid into the Medifund account by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the business community, the Government is\r\n\r\ngranting  some  tax  rebates  and  extending  the  rental\r\n\r\nrebates to help companies reduce their business cost  and\r\n\r\nenhance their competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also accepting the Economic Review\r\n\r\nCommittee's     recommendations  of   the   five   strong\r\n\r\nstrategies to enable Singapore to remain competitive  and\r\n\r\nestablish itself as a leading global city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the Government has\r\n\r\ndone  so much, there are still some people who feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  is  not generous enough.  I  can  understand\r\n\r\ntheir  feelings.  It is never easy for any Government  to\r\n\r\nplease  everybody.   If there is no complaint,  it  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has done perfectly well, and  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no  improvement  and  progress.  That  is   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily a good thing!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reading the Lianhe Zaobao on 1st March 2003, I\r\n\r\npaid  particular attention to the remarks  given  by  the\r\n\r\nNCMP  and  the  Opposition MPs.   I  feel  that  in  this\r\n\r\ndifficult  time, whether you are a Government  MP  or  an\r\n\r\nOpposition MP, we should all try not to please the people\r\n\r\nwith  claptraps,  but  rather  contribute  feasible   and\r\n\r\nconstructive suggestions on the real issues. Do not  harp\r\n\r\non the same old tune and adopt a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsentimental  pose.  Do not be carried away  just  because\r\n\r\nsomeone sings some praises to you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, the young people are pressurised\r\n\r\nin  their studies. They also face the gloomy prospect  of\r\n\r\nsecuring  a rewarding job after graduation.  The  middle-aged  people worry about their job security, and  whether\r\n\r\nthey  can  continue to draw a regular income to  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  families.   The  older people  worry  about  their\r\n\r\nability  to  afford the healthcare services  provided  by\r\n\r\nthe Government, and try not to burden their children with\r\n\r\ntheir  medical cost.  Today, the people's concern is  not\r\n\r\non  the  salaries of the Ministers and the  senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants,  but  whether the Ministers  and  senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants  can  help them to solve their unemployment  and\r\n\r\nhealthcare problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a labour MP, I am glad that the Government has\r\n\r\nset  aside $500 million to establish a Lifelong  Learning\r\n\r\nFund  to  assist  the  workers  in  their  upgrading  and\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes.   I am also  encouraged  about  the\r\n\r\ninitiation of $3.7 million for a MOM training  scheme  to\r\n\r\nprovide  assistance  to  the  unemployed  and  retrenched\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  so  as to equip them  with  the  necessary\r\n\r\nskills for re-employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to commend the Government for the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a Continuing Education and Training  Centre\r\n\r\nfor adults. However, I hope that the Ministry would scout\r\n\r\naround  for the right people with the necessary  know-how\r\n\r\nand  experience  to manage the centre  so  that  relevant\r\n\r\ntraining programmes would be rolled out to suit the needs\r\n\r\nof  individuals,  and  to equip them  with  the  relevant\r\n\r\nskills  for better employability. Any irrelevant training\r\n\r\nprogramme  would  only result in more disappointment  and\r\n\r\nfrustration of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, the Government should consider my\r\n\r\nfellow  labour  MP,  Mr  Seng Han Thong's  suggestion  of\r\n\r\ngetting  the workers employed before undergoing training.\r\n\r\nThis  would  boost  their confidence and  they  would  be\r\n\r\nbetter prepared to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  training  programmes   to   improve\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey conducted by the National\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore, our graduates no longer  expect\r\n\r\nhigh  starting salaries upon graduation. Some 85% of  NUS\r\n\r\ngraduates  are  prepared  to  participate  in    training\r\n\r\nprogrammes to upgrade their skills so as to improve their\r\n\r\nchances  of  being  employed. This is a very  encouraging\r\n\r\nsign!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the mature workers would also seize the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to   upgrade their skills in  whatever  line\r\n\r\nthey  are in so as to enhance their employability.   They\r\n\r\nshould  persevere and be courageous in taking up training\r\n\r\nprogrammes and learn new skills so that they can be self-reliant.   To  make  a good living they  must  depend  on\r\n\r\nthemselves rather than on others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have asked me why the NTUC has not\r\n\r\nopposed the Government's delay in the restoration of  CPF\r\n\r\nand  the  gradual  reduction in the CPF  salary  ceiling.\r\n\r\nThey asked why the NTUC dare not hold a demonstration  in\r\n\r\nthe  streets.   I told them that even if a  demonstration\r\n\r\nsucceeds  in  getting the Government to restore  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  to 40%, and no lowering of the  CPF  salary\r\n\r\nceiling, it would only succeed in making the headlines of\r\n\r\nthe   foreign   newspapers  and  our   Secretary-General,\r\n\r\nMinister Lim Boon Heng would be hoisted as a hero.   This\r\n\r\nwould  be very thrilling and awe-inspring, but what  will\r\n\r\nbe  the  end  result?  The end result would be  that  the\r\n\r\ncompanies,  owing to higher business cost and  a  heavier\r\n\r\nburden to carry, will  retrench  more workers, and  there\r\n\r\nwill be more unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we do not want to have more workers\r\n\r\nretrenched,  we  support the Government's action  because\r\n\r\nthat will ensure that our workers get to keep their jobs,\r\n\r\nand  the  employers would be able to survive, to continue\r\n\r\nlooking for openings to expand their business, and  hence\r\n\r\ncreate more jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, since 1965, the Malaysia media\r\n\r\nhave been regarding Singapore as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  \"abnormal baby\" abandoned by Tunku Abdul Rahman.   We\r\n\r\ncan  read  this in their newspapers all the  time.   They\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  Singapore could  not  survive  after  its\r\n\r\nseparation   from  Malaysia,  and  they  never   expected\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  grow  and  prosper.  Apart  from  being  a\r\n\r\npolitician,  Senior  Minister Lee is also  a  first-class\r\n\r\ndoctor. Under his careful nurturing, this \"abnormal baby\"\r\n\r\ngrew  up  strong  and healthy, it did not  die  an  early\r\n\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Prime Minister Mahathir is an\r\n\r\nastute  statesman.  As a doctor, he knows  that  one  can\r\n\r\nsurvive  without food for three days but no one can  live\r\n\r\nfor  three days without water. As such, he has been using\r\n\r\nthe  water  issue  as a lever against Singapore.  But  he\r\n\r\nforgets  that  our  Prime Minister Goh  is  also  a  very\r\n\r\nbrilliant   person.  He  adopted   the   NEWater   as   a\r\n\r\nsubstitution for natural water,  to ensure that we do not\r\n\r\ndie young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still surviving and we will continue to do\r\n\r\nso. Singaporeans should be proud that our leaders are all\r\n\r\nvery skilful kung fu experts.  They can deal with all the\r\n\r\nblows  that have been rained on them.  However, we should\r\n\r\nnot  be complacent, neither shall we be self-abased  just\r\n\r\nbecause  we are a \"little red dot\". We want to live  with\r\n\r\ndignity  and  self-respect,  but  not  forgetting  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for danger in times of peace, and  be  vigilant\r\n\r\neven in peace time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Taiwanese friend of mine commented to me that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  was  like  a  \"twenty-four  filial\r\n\r\nfather\"  (a  Taiwanese dialect expression to  the  effect\r\n\r\nthat  the father takes extreme care and looks after every\r\n\r\ndetail  of his children's well-being).   Perhaps this  is\r\n\r\nwhy   our  people  are  so  heavily  dependent   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I think this is food for thought!  We should\r\n\r\nall ponder over this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Senior Minister of State for Trade\r\n\r\nand  Industry  that  it  is not the  policy  that  drives\r\n\r\nSingapore  ahead.   It is everybody,  every  company  and\r\n\r\nevery individual that drives the country forward.  We are\r\n\r\nall  assets  of  Singapore.  We  can  make  contribution.\r\n\r\nEveryone of us must work hard.  We must learn how  to  be\r\n\r\nself-reliant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore is small in land, with a small population.   We\r\n\r\nmust look after one another, stay united so that together\r\n\r\nwe   will   be  able  to  help  Singapore  maintain   its\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge.  As the Finance Minister has  said,  we\r\n\r\nwill then become a leading metropolis in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nit  is  interesting to note that when  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   delivered  his  Budget  Statement,   we   were\r\n\r\nexpecting  both  a  response  to  the  ERC  report  which\r\n\r\ncontains   recommendations  for  the  longer   term   and\r\n\r\nGovernment's  package of measures for  the  immediate  or\r\n\r\nshort-term challenges.  Some of these ideas may appear to\r\n\r\ncontradict  one another.  But the themes common  to  both\r\n\r\nare  those  of  Singapore's competitiveness and  economic\r\n\r\npositioning.   Let  me dwell on three aspects,  with  the\r\n\r\nfirst in greater detail.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF and the Concept of Retirement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC has made many recommendations on\r\n\r\nrestructuring  the Central Provident  Fund  in  order  to\r\n\r\nrefocus  its  role  back  to  old  age  financing.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has decided to defer the restoration  of  the\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution  rates for two  years,  lowered  salary\r\n\r\nceilings for contributions and reduced contribution rates\r\n\r\nfor  older workers, whilst phasing in higher contribution\r\n\r\nrates to the Special and Medisave Accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these can be confusing signals, as they serve\r\n\r\ndifferent    purposes   -   from   ensuring   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness to providing for old age to checking  any\r\n\r\nimprudent allocations to property investment.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthe  discussion  on  what appropriate structure  our  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme  should take is incomplete without addressing  the\r\n\r\nfundamental concept of retirement itself, and not  enough\r\n\r\nattention is paid to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generations ahead of us never stopped working\r\n\r\nand  had no concept of retirement.  They literally worked\r\n\r\ntill  they  dropped or were prevented from  doing  so  by\r\n\r\nillness.    The   present  generation  of   Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nhowever, feel they have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworked doubly hard, no thanks to the competitive pressure\r\n\r\nfrom    globalisation    and   technological    advances.\r\n\r\nRetirement is therefore a given - regarded by some  as  a\r\n\r\nnecessity, by others as an entitlement and, to many,  the\r\n\r\nearlier the better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the reality is, as a nation, we cannot\r\n\r\nafford  the pensions and the CPF savings are insufficient\r\n\r\nfor most people.  With the CPF withdrawal age at 55 and a\r\n\r\nlife  span of almost 80, we could be facing some  serious\r\n\r\nchallenges if Singaporeans, who are expecting  to  retire\r\n\r\nat  around  60-62,  fail to ensure they  have  sufficient\r\n\r\nfinances  for  themselves for a good 20-25  years.   This\r\n\r\ntakes  on  greater urgency when one were to look  at  the\r\n\r\nsweeping changes to the concept of employment itself and,\r\n\r\nspecifically,  to the relationship between  the  employer\r\n\r\nand  the  employee.   Let me explain  why  I  think  this\r\n\r\nrelationship will increasingly be mercenary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the idea of a one-career-in-one's-lifetime\r\n\r\nis  no  longer the reality.  Business and product  cycles\r\n\r\nare  shorter.  Just look at the speed at which new mobile\r\n\r\nphone designs flood the market.  A manufacturer employing\r\n\r\na  few  thousand workers today may be history in a matter\r\n\r\nof  2-3 years.  Thus, a person will increasingly have  to\r\n\r\nbring his skills across different industries in order  to\r\n\r\nremain employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more unlikely is the possibility of one-employer-in-one's-lifetime. This is not peculiar to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is incumbent on corporations world-wide to\r\n\r\nrestructure  and  re-position  themselves  to  meet   the\r\n\r\nchanging demands of a global market place.  Look  at  the\r\n\r\nsweeping  changes in the telecommunications arena.   Even\r\n\r\nhitherto  old-fashioned businesses, like postal services,\r\n\r\nhave  extended themselves into a larger supply  chain  of\r\n\r\ncourier and other distribution services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even Government Ministries have to remake\r\n\r\nthemselves  on  a  continual basis to serve  the  economy\r\n\r\nbetter.   For  example, the creation of Media Development\r\n\r\nAuthority  to  deal with the convergence of channels  and\r\n\r\nthe corporatisation of certain services like HDB Corp.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With employment trends changing in tandem with those\r\n\r\nin  the  underlying  economy, gone  are  the  days  of  a\r\n\r\npredictable  job pattern and fixed compensation  schemes.\r\n\r\nJobs  are  no longer 9-5, Mondays to Fridays, or confined\r\n\r\nto  working within Singapore.  Salaries will increasingly\r\n\r\nbe linked to performance rather than to seniority or pre-determined  salary structure.  The short business  cycles\r\n\r\nmean  that  companies can no longer  carry  fixed  labour\r\n\r\noverheads and that they need to be nimble-footed when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  right-sizing.  Therefore, unlike in  the  past\r\n\r\nwhere contract work is associated with temporary or  even\r\n\r\ncheap labour, contract work will increasingly be the norm\r\n\r\nfor many professions.  By extension, Singaporeans can  no\r\n\r\nlonger expect the income levels to be one predictable and\r\n\r\nregular  wave, but a series of steps, both up  and  down,\r\n\r\nwith   the  occasional  gaps.   Towards  this  end,   the\r\n\r\npromotion of portable medical benefits is a step  in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction of dealing with multiple  employers  and\r\n\r\nthe occasional breathers in-between employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, the concept of retirement at a\r\n\r\ncertain  legislated  age is no longer  tenable.   Neither\r\n\r\nwill  it be helpful to our ageing nation.  Some may argue\r\n\r\nthat  the solution may be found in raising the retirement\r\n\r\nage,  difficult  as it is politically, to  inch  the  bar\r\n\r\nupwards.  Sir, I believe we should abandon the concept of\r\n\r\nretirement  altogether,  and  the  earlier  the   better.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should  decide  when  they  want  to   make\r\n\r\ntransitions between jobs or to slow down at a certain age\r\n\r\nor  when  they would like more leisure.  We  should  work\r\n\r\nlonger,  but  moderate the pace as we go  along  and  not\r\n\r\nartificially stop at some pre-determined age.   Moreover,\r\n\r\nthere  is anecdotal evidence that an abrupt end to active\r\n\r\nemployment can cause the retiree to lose self-esteem  and\r\n\r\nsuffer poor health prematurely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to urge the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider abandoning the whole concept of retirement  even\r\n\r\nas we proceed with the various CPF changes.  In addition,\r\n\r\ncan incentives be provided\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans to maintain sufficient finances as they\r\n\r\nage,  eg,  such that CPF balances are kept even past  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  age of 55 years?  At the same time,  can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  inject more resources into  facilitating  the\r\n\r\nemployment  of  older people on a contract  or  part-time\r\n\r\nbasis?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Role of Government in Services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has elaborated on the\r\n\r\nneed  for  us to nurture the services sector  as  a  twin\r\n\r\nengine  of  growth  to  manufacturing.   But,  many  have\r\n\r\nunwittingly  limited  this to the  role  of  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  as  the driver, with the Government  playing  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  a  facilitator or, better still, as a  customer\r\n\r\nthrough  continual outsourcing of non-strategic services.\r\n\r\nSir, I agree that the Government should outsource as much\r\n\r\nas  possible.  However, we should not pre-judge the roles\r\n\r\nor  limit  our own potential as a collective  whole.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to  think  out  of  the box, blur  the  demarcation\r\n\r\nbetween  the  public  and  private  sectors  and  do   an\r\n\r\ninventory  of our services expertise.  Let me  illustrate\r\n\r\nwith some examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of our expertise resides within the Government\r\n\r\nMinistries.   In education, we have over the years  honed\r\n\r\nour  abilities  to  develop sound curricula  and  testing\r\n\r\nresources  for schools, established commendable practices\r\n\r\nfor  managing educational institutions and systematically\r\n\r\nnurturing  teaching resources.  Some schools  in  the  US\r\n\r\nhave   paid  the  compliment  by  using  our  mathematics\r\n\r\ntextbooks.   Foreign delegations visit  our  schools  for\r\n\r\nideas and to learn more from our experience, and the list\r\n\r\ngoes on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other examples can be found in our healthcare\r\n\r\nservices,   town-planning  and  business   infrastructure\r\n\r\nbuilding  skills.   But  these are all  deemed  strategic\r\n\r\nservices  and  thus  far  the respective  Ministries  are\r\n\r\nunlikely to have considered their commercial applications\r\n\r\nbeyond Singapore.  Earlier on, my colleague Mr Khaw  Boon\r\n\r\nWan had explained the concerns over the influx of foreign\r\n\r\npatients which may drive up healthcare cost in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut I also note that he gave many other examples of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  pockets  of expertise that we have, for example,  in\r\n\r\nrunning libraries.  Sir, I am optimistic that we can  add\r\n\r\nsubstantial  economic  vibrancy  through  broadening  the\r\n\r\nservices  sector.   The challenge  is  therefore  one  of\r\n\r\ncommercialising such skills and exporting them to markets\r\n\r\nwhere  the stage of development warrants the use of  such\r\n\r\nexpertise.   I  would  like  to  urge  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  in  his  capacity  as  Chairman  of  the   new\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Committee on Services, to place emphasis  on\r\n\r\nand   explore  the  commercialisation  of  the  expertise\r\n\r\nresiding within the Ministries.  I am hopeful that  these\r\n\r\ncan  be nurtured into new services to be exported and can\r\n\r\nin  turn  spawn  new business for the private  sector  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in.  Unlike Mr Chiam See Tong, I do think  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  operate on a caveat emptor principle as opposed\r\n\r\nto tight regulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Role of the Public Sector in Economy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is heartening to note that the Government\r\n\r\nwill devote serious efforts to reviewing rules.  This  is\r\n\r\nto  be applauded but perhaps the Government should go one\r\n\r\nstep further and impose the sunset clause requirement  to\r\n\r\nrules  relating to business operations.  A sunset  clause\r\n\r\nputs  the  onus  on  the Ministry or statutory  board  to\r\n\r\njustify  why a particular rule should be kept, whereas  a\r\n\r\nreview  is  likely to lead to the retention  of  existing\r\n\r\nrules than otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as some of my colleagues have urged, we need to\r\n\r\nshift  towards being more pro-business rather  than  pro-risk aversion.  Generally, our policies are sound but our\r\n\r\nexecution  is  frequently fraught  with  an  overkill  of\r\n\r\nmeasures to stem out the violation of rules.  This, I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  is  best described by the now famous  \"no  u-turn\"\r\n\r\nstory  about  policy  execution in  Singapore.   Like  Mr\r\n\r\nRaymond  Lim, my plea to the public sector is:   when  in\r\n\r\ndoubt on business issues, please say yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Singapore's competitiveness, I would\r\n\r\nlike to propose that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelevant  Ministries  and statutory  boards  be  assessed\r\n\r\naccording  to  how well they contain business  and  other\r\n\r\noperating  costs  under their watch.   This  goes  beyond\r\n\r\nreviewing  fees and charges.  For example, in  compliance\r\n\r\nchecking  with the financial institution, if  more  hours\r\n\r\nare  spent fulfilling this requirement from one  year  to\r\n\r\nanother,  the spotlight should be shone.  Frequently,  it\r\n\r\nis  time costs which are the real hidden costs.  In  this\r\n\r\ncontext,  Ministries should be encouraged  to  pledge   a\r\n\r\ncertain  standard of service which must be credible,  not\r\n\r\nthe  usual  3-6  months or 4-6 weeks,  but  one  that  is\r\n\r\nreflective of a real intent to provide top notch service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have an excellent public sector which has\r\n\r\nserved us well.  In meeting the challenges ahead, we need\r\n\r\nto  have the same amount of nimble footedness in both the\r\n\r\nprivate and public sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy\r\n\r\nfor the new fiscal year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

The\r\n\r\nprivate  pension  plans are meant to  facilitate  regular\r\n\r\ninvestments  over  a long-term horizon,  but  should  not\r\n\r\nrequire  members to make complicated investment decisions\r\n\r\n(cost  of participation should be kept low). This  is  to\r\n\r\ncater  for  the  majority  of CPF  members  who  are  not\r\n\r\ninvestment-savvy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details on the private pension plan framework will\r\n\r\nbe  announced  in a few months' time.
