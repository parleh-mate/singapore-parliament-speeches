In 2011, 26 employers were convicted of Employment\r\nAct offences, of which 22 were for salary-related offences. Thirteen\r\nother salary arrears cases are currently before the courts. Under\r\nthe Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA), employers of non-Malaysian foreign\r\nworkers and foreign domestic workers are also required to put up\r\na $5,000 security bond that can be forfeited if salaries are not\r\npaid promptly.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1420</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7fc3ffcd-caa4-4438-af59-e9ce4ede2a04\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-43beb801-a6ac-4674-b0ba-f84c309ba6b8__id-7fc3ffcd-caa4-4438-af59-e9ce4ede2a04\"><!--a--></a>MOM has also put in place\r\nmeasures to ensure that foreign workers are kept informed of their\r\nsalary components prior to entering Singapore.

We are looking at how we can tighten it and how\r\nwe can deal with companies that violate the rules and regulations.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 1421</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\">Employment\r\nof Ex-Offenders<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-cc8910ae-106d-43f1-a66a-c4bcd52dc9b4\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-cc8910ae-106d-43f1-a66a-c4bcd52dc9b4\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <h2 class=\"shortdesc hcSubTitle\">(Effectiveness of the\r\nYellow Ribbon Project)</h2>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-4872c1c1-1064-4716-bf9a-0c999cb4c0e3\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-81813556-79f8-456e-834e-902ab8eeadc1__id-4872c1c1-1064-4716-bf9a-0c999cb4c0e3\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6aa1b0fb-2a74-432c-8134-b9c0423dd0f8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-81813556-79f8-456e-834e-902ab8eeadc1__id-6aa1b0fb-2a74-432c-8134-b9c0423dd0f8\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">3 </span>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs since the\r\nlaunch of the Yellow Ribbon Project in 2004 (a) how many ex-prisoners enrolled\r\nin this Project have been able to secure a job; (b) what is the\r\nsuccess rate of the Project; and (c) what are the follow-up programmes\r\nand whether these programmes track those who are still jobless to\r\nhelp them secure jobs again. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcAnswer\" id=\"id-10b10fe0-3133-4070-85a9-e5d6d5b0c567\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-81813556-79f8-456e-834e-902ab8eeadc1__id-10b10fe0-3133-4070-85a9-e5d6d5b0c567\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e22e17d9-ee45-49e4-a397-8bed4761c177\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-81813556-79f8-456e-834e-902ab8eeadc1__id-e22e17d9-ee45-49e4-a397-8bed4761c177\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Minister of State for Home Affairs\r\n(Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and the\r\nMinister for Home Affairs)</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker, the Yellow\r\nRibbon Project seeks to engage the community and garner community\r\nsupport for ex-offenders and their family in order to give them\r\na second chance in life.

To help offenders transit\r\nfrom Prisons into the workforce and stabilise in their jobs, SCORE\r\nalso introduced the Case Management Service in 2007.

In 2011, 1,586 offenders were case-managed at work.\r\nOf these, 78% had stayed on the job for three months and 54% had\r\nstayed on the job for six months. Ex-offenders who are looking for\r\na job or have lost their job can approach the Employment Assistance\r\nUnit of SCORE. In 2011, 492 ex-offenders sought SCORE's assistance.\r\nOf these, 363, or 74%, successfully secured jobs and have started\r\nwork.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2a930c99-dfb4-48b5-952e-ab297a68cf4d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-81813556-79f8-456e-834e-902ab8eeadc1__id-2a930c99-dfb4-48b5-952e-ab297a68cf4d\"><!--a--></a>Underpinning these efforts\r\nare the ex-offenders' commitment, discipline and preparedness to\r\nwork hard and remain in stable employment.

There are few objections towards\r\nthe statement that Singapore needs to reduce its reliance on foreign workers\r\nand steer its economy toward higher productivity. But, growing productivity takes\r\ntime and replacing foreign workers with more locals in a tight labour\r\nmarket will be extremely challenging in the short to medium term.\r\nHence, there are concerns that the shortage of foreign labour may\r\nhurt small businesses and eventually increase costs for everyone.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-17e99b3f-f7c9-43ab-bb63-5865ab1b5707\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-17e99b3f-f7c9-43ab-bb63-5865ab1b5707\"><!--a--></a>We need to stay the course\r\nin climbing the productivity ladder, lest cheaper foreign workers\r\nbecome an intoxicant that numbs us to the need to restructure for\r\nthe long term.

After a strong 11% labour productivity\r\ngrowth in 2010, our productivity growth virtually ground to a halt\r\nin 2011 at 1%. Although this may be attributed to a lower 4.9% GDP\r\ngrowth and more jobs being created, it does show that shifting the\r\neconomy to a productivity-driven model is not so simple. It is very\r\ndifficult to wean companies off their dependence on foreign labour because\r\nthat is the quickest fix, and SMEs rarely have the luxury to think\r\nlong term when the entrepreneurs who run them have to deal with\r\nday-to-day business challenges. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1424</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6d55b749-c539-4f6a-82c7-896e7327e989\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6d55b749-c539-4f6a-82c7-896e7327e989\"><!--a--></a>Besides the measures announced\r\nin Budget 2012 to incentivise companies to improve productivity,\r\nthe Government will need to work closely with the various industry\r\nsectors to change mindsets and more aggressively drive productivity initiatives.\r\nEmployers will also have to make concerted effort to adapt their\r\nwork processes to include more flexible work hours and better HR\r\npolicies and pay structures to accommodate older workers and other\r\nuntapped labour pools such as back-to-work women.

While Government transfers\r\nand taxes have brought down the corresponding Gini coefficients\r\nfor 2000 and 2011 to 0.434 and 0.452 respectively, it has thus far\r\nnot reversed the general rising trend of income inequality. This\r\nis despite the higher and higher amounts of funds allocated to social\r\ndevelopment. For instance, social spending rose from $13 billion,\r\nor 5.5% of GDP, in FY 2006 to $21.5 billion, or 6.6% of GDP, in\r\nFY 2011, both in absolute terms and in proportion to share of overall\r\nbudget.

Millions\r\nhave been uplifted from their poverty in many countries that have embraced\r\nmarket reforms and plugged their economies into the global trading\r\nsystem. But, we need to address the inequalities which plague dense\r\ncities like Singapore. The problem will not easily disappear anytime\r\nsoon. In fact, perhaps alarmingly, it is likely to worsen as the\r\nnumbers of dependent aged rise. The investment in up-levellers like education,\r\nwhich this Budget also offers, pays dividend only in the long term.\r\nThe persistence of the widening income gaps thus calls for a reinforced\r\nfiscal policy to tackle the problem.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-731c83ce-07cf-4fe3-8927-d49d63ece562\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-731c83ce-07cf-4fe3-8927-d49d63ece562\"><!--a--></a>Hence, my second point:\r\na fresh approach. When the global financial crisis broke out in\r\n2008, central banks around the world resorted to a massive and co-ordinated\r\ninjection of liquidity to decisively unclog credit channels and\r\nhelp re-start bank lending.

I call this a responsive government although some Opposition\r\nMembers would label it a populist move.

It is a fresh approach\r\nbecause the Government has brought to bear substantially more funds than\r\nhitherto to try and decisively tackle the income gap.

For instance, only about a third of the GST Voucher\r\nscheme is in cash whilst the other two portions are directed toward\r\nMedisave for the elderly and utility subsidies. Whilst some of these\r\nmight need further refinements, we must never veer away from the\r\ngoal of all such schemes, that is to give a leg up and promote self\r\nreliance as far as possible. At the same time, measures to ensure\r\nsocial mobility for the young who may come from low income families\r\nare crucial so as to ensure that they have a chance of getting out\r\nof the poverty trap.

This will certainly\r\nhelp to improve the retirement provisions for our elderly workers.\r\nOther pro-elderly measures such as the Special Employment Credit (SEC),\r\nthe Silver Housing Bonus, family grant for maids, enhanced Medifund\r\nand top-ups to MediShield demonstrate a committed and holistic framework\r\nin taking care of the not-so-young.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1430</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e3e6ee56-7fd1-4a43-bb79-65cf2750e639\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e3e6ee56-7fd1-4a43-bb79-65cf2750e639\"><!--a--></a>Since the release of the\r\nBudget, we know that there has been feedback that the Silver Housing\r\nBonus is not particularly attractive as most of the elderly are\r\naccustomed to their own house and selling it is really a last resort.\r\nThe more critical aspects thereby lie in their ability to continue\r\nto draw an income and the medical care that they are able to receive.\r\nOur employers' attitudes are paramount in helping our elderly sustain meaningful\r\njobs and income. However, I worry for some quarters, including SMEs,\r\nwho face increasing cost pressures and I hope that employers will\r\nbe enlightened not to offset the costs of the CPF rate increase\r\nthrough other cost-cutting measures and in a worst-case scenario,\r\ncut their jobs. I believe the subvention provided by the Government to\r\nthem will alleviate their costs.

While there\r\nwill be higher provisions in the Budget set aside for the Baby Bonus\r\nin anticipation of a Dragon Year, I would like to ask about the\r\noverall approach of our procreation policies. We all know that men\r\nand women are getting married at a later age and thus starting a\r\nfamily at a later age. The challenge is that our strong work ethos,\r\nout of financial need, is getting in the way of developing a balanced\r\nand happy family life. Greater attention needs to be devoted to\r\nhow the social and work environment can be geared towards providing better\r\nsupport. Even when people do get hitched, the huge financial costs\r\nof a house and wedding are pushing our people either into debt or\r\ncold feet, whichever may come first. In the final hurdle, the affordability\r\nof having a child will set anyone thinking. To further exacerbate, the jobs\r\nof working mothers are also at stake. In fact, today's papers as\r\nwell as on Monday, <em class=\"ph i\">TODAY</em> carried a report of a lady being\r\nterminated after she discovered she was pregnant and informed her\r\nbosses. On wrongful dismissal complaints filed by pregnant women\r\nwhich had increased by 33% to 112 cases in 2011, more than nine\r\nin 10 of the women who filed complaints last year were sacked during\r\npregnancy.

The arts alone are no\r\npanacea, any more than economic policies are.

What do the arts teach us about inclusion? That it must be\r\nqualitative, and not just quantitative. The beauty of art is that\r\nit does not limit itself to addressing us as Singaporeans. It addresses\r\nus as human beings \u2013 one of whose characteristics is a powerful\r\ndesire to belong, with the capacity to achieve more together than\r\nwe can alone. How important this becomes in a place like multicultural\r\nSingapore, where we continue to welcome and live alongside new immigrants\r\nand foreigners, jostling along together on our densely populated\r\nisland. An inclusive society is one where the arts and culture belong\r\nto everyone and Singaporeans should be encouraged to embrace those\r\nconnections that identify them as a people, whether it is our food, architecture,\r\ntraditional customs, religious practices or language.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a7bfa49a-0fed-49b7-82ff-e189b94aaf22\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a7bfa49a-0fed-49b7-82ff-e189b94aaf22\"><!--a--></a>But as we increase and\r\nextend the scale of inclusion, we also need to look at deepening\r\nthe nature of our participation. This means giving Singaporeans\r\na greater say in what our cultural heritage is. This should include\r\ninvolvement in debates over the conservation and preservation of\r\nour natural and historic spaces, as well as a greater recognition\r\nof the languages we use to express our points of view. Our various\r\ndialects, as well as Singlish, are also part of our unique cultural\r\nidentity, because culture is the way we live \u2013 it resides in our\r\nbodies, it is in the way we communicate.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-892ff4d5-f3ec-4cf1-a6e2-c9ee0518f08d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-892ff4d5-f3ec-4cf1-a6e2-c9ee0518f08d\"><!--a--></a>Our heritage is made up\r\nof many different stories.

But none of these responses stop you from feeling,\r\n\"That's about us.\" On the contrary, it deepens our understanding\r\nof the often exhilarating and sometimes maddening complexity of\r\nall human beings, including ourselves, and it reminds us what an\r\nincredible opportunity our multicultural society offers for appreciating\r\nthat complexity in all its variety. And may I add, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\nthat for these reasons, the Government should not shy away from\r\nsupporting creative expression that may even challenge its views.\r\nTo be truly inclusive, the Singapore Story must be the sum of stories\r\nand experiences of all Singaporeans, and even non-Singaporeans who\r\nhave been touched by Singapore.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5b2cf2f0-9a6a-423e-9207-ef93348fede1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5b2cf2f0-9a6a-423e-9207-ef93348fede1\"><!--a--></a>The second cultural strategy\r\ntowards building an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore is\r\ndeveloping Arts for Life. Oftentimes, we think of the arts as a\r\nproduct. After all, that is how we encounter them most of the time,\r\nright? A concert planned for, a book read on the MRT, an exhibition\r\nvisited on impulse. So, when we talk about \"Arts for all\", we typically\r\nsee it in terms of putting a cultural product into the hands of\r\nconsumers. But artworks are the result of a long and often painstaking\r\nprocess. This process of art making challenges us to question, to\r\nshare perspectives and allow for differing points of view. It encourages\r\nus to take risks and be accepting of failure. It serves as an excellent platform\r\nto raise difficult issues for discussion, and through the process\r\nof engagement, builds understanding and empathy. To say that these\r\nprocesses take time is an understatement. In fact, one of the best\r\nways of looking at the arts is as something we make or encounter\r\nthroughout our lives. That is why the benefits of arts participation\r\nfor all, including children, young people, the elderly and vulnerable\r\nsegments of our society, cannot always be calculated in terms of\r\naudience attendance or number of activities.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cc13a17e-6248-45ba-ad6a-9b115a879bea\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-cc13a17e-6248-45ba-ad6a-9b115a879bea\"><!--a--></a>I have a story from Ms\r\nNoorlinah Mohammed, who is an experienced arts educator currently\r\npursuing her PhD in the UK. She told me about teaching drama to\r\na group of Secondary 2 students in Singapore. There were several\r\ncliques amongst the students in the class, and they were split along\r\nlanguage lines \u2013 Hokkien, Mandarin, Malay. Six weeks into the weekly\r\ndrama workshops, Noorlinah asked the students to create a 10-minute\r\nperformance. It was challenging. One boy, in particular, could barely communicate\r\nin English. His life was tough. He had problems at home. He was\r\nangry. He hated school, and he just thought drama was plain silly.\r\nBut he wrote an honest scene about a boy talking to his mum, expressing\r\nthe hurt caused by her neglect. It lasted 30 seconds. For a boy\r\nwho seldom expressed himself at all, a half-minute monologue is\r\na major feat. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-552a37b0-8079-4268-9f36-cdd090616968\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-552a37b0-8079-4268-9f36-cdd090616968\"><!--a--></a>Later, the boy decided\r\nhe would perform his script in English. He attended school every\r\nweek just to work on this scene. His teachers were impressed that\r\ndrama was pulling him back to school. He worked hard at memorising\r\nhis script and, one day, he finally did. Despite the inadequacy\r\nhe felt speaking English, he found the courage to stand up in front\r\nof others to tell a story that was deeply personal. The triumph\r\nhe must have felt in defeating the English language, for 30 whole\r\nseconds! It was enough to give him a sense of achievement, beyond\r\nschool grades and exams. The following year, he went on to do digital\r\nart, and his teacher says that he is doing quite well in that now.\r\nI salute arts educators like Ms Noorlinah Mohammed, and the teachers\r\nwho were instrumental\r\nin sustaining arts education in Ang Mo Kio Secondary School, where\r\nthis boy studies. They recognise that the arts can make a ground-level\r\ndifference, especially to students who have difficulty with life\r\nskills that many of us take for granted. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1434</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2fcbced8-5f8a-4a41-990d-451fcad5f73e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2fcbced8-5f8a-4a41-990d-451fcad5f73e\"><!--a--></a>It does not stop there.\r\nTheatre for Seniors is a new group given a head start by theatre company\r\nThe Necessary Stage.

The Government is applying a\r\ntwo-pronged approach by manipulating the Dependency Ratio Ceiling\r\n(DRC) and the foreign worker levy. I think, based on current experience,\r\nthese two mechanisms are blunt policy tools which do not differentiate\r\nbetween the different needs of various industries and do not set\r\nout customised DRC and foreign worker levy.

For example, in 2011, the Government issued 176,000\r\nEmployment Passes, this is 63,000 more than the 113,000 Employment\r\nPasses issued in 2010.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5f7a5c65-4853-45bc-b262-0501a104c9c3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5f7a5c65-4853-45bc-b262-0501a104c9c3\"><!--a--></a>If the trend of rapidly\r\nincreasing Employment Passes continues, how does that affect Government's\r\nobjective of reducing reliance on foreign labour?

This is because\r\npermanent residents do not need to apply for work permit, and are\r\nnot restricted by the Government's limit on foreign workers. The\r\nnumber of applications approved for permanent residents has decreased\r\nfrom 79,000 in 2008 to 29,000 in 2010.

On the economic\r\nside, the Budget needs to take reference from what our new economic\r\nmodel might look like, and, particularly, how we see ourselves doing\r\nbusiness and creating value in future. Yes, we need to wean ourselves\r\noff cheap foreign labour, and we should aim for higher productivity\r\nand innovation. But we do need a theme beyond the need to \"restructure\r\nto sustain growth\". Of concern to me is that our nation ends up\r\nproducing goods that the developed world, in their debt-laden state,\r\ncannot afford, and the developing world would not buy. It could be\r\na case of incumbents like us overshooting what the customers want,\r\nand not being open to disruptive innovations. Increasingly, our\r\nnew customers are in emerging Asia.

The symptoms include rising\r\nlevels of mental ill-health, loneliness and increased addictions, and\r\nit is caused by the stresses of living, and by individualism and\r\nmaterialism.

In Singapore, one key challenge is the growing\r\ndependency on the Government to solve all problems, big and small,\r\nwhere the community disowns roles it can and should take on.

Here, there are many questions that beg\r\nto be answered. What are the social ethos and values that shape\r\nour society? What is our conception of the good life? How do we\r\ndeal with each other, with increasingly divergent interests? What\r\nare the principles and foundations of the new social compact? What\r\nis the Government's role? For me, I believe in a more communitarian\r\nsociety, with a more egalitarian ethos. The State must do more to\r\nprotect citizens from the vagaries of the market, to ensure a more\r\nsustainable level of distributive justice and build social infrastructure.\r\nAt the same time, the State needs to do less in social and cultural activities.\r\nGovernment should refrain from undertaking activities that the community, the\r\nfamily and the individuals can take on. Instead, the State should\r\nstep in only when the initiatives clearly exceed the capacity of\r\nindividuals or private groups acting independently. But these are\r\nonly my beliefs. I want to hear from others.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-14f68e68-f2fd-4c5d-892c-f8cb3ff2182f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-14f68e68-f2fd-4c5d-892c-f8cb3ff2182f\"><!--a--></a>Secondly, in the area\r\nof Government-to-People relations, I would advocate that the Government\r\nfocuses more on enabling and empowering citizens and civil society\r\nto do more. This is related to my last point. Enabling means building\r\ncapability and developing leadership in the community. Empowering\r\nmeans a real ceding of power, decision-making and ownership of projects,\r\nwith a tolerance for a degree of messiness and inefficiency. The\r\nlanguage from Government is so far more of communication and engagement,\r\nnot empowerment. Power is often seen as a zero-sum game \u2013 the more you\r\nhave, the less I have. But I believe, instead, that power is something\r\nthat can be grown and shared. We need to put more power back into\r\nthe people, both into designing their futures and into taking charge\r\nof what affects their everyday lives, like how to design their neighbourhoods,\r\nuse common spaces, site facilities, and restrict noise levels and\r\nother negative externalities. We should devolve power to the communities and\r\ngrassroots, away from the more centralised methods of today. There\r\nare good process tools that community leaders can use to help people\r\nmake good decisions \u2013 through community visioning and planning,\r\nand large group decision making centred on community values linking\r\nthe selves to groups and finally to the community. The National\r\nVolunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre is experimenting with some of\r\nthese tools on the ground through our Asset-Based Community Development\r\napproach. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e26aa4bc-1148-4ba9-844d-721be1396e20\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e26aa4bc-1148-4ba9-844d-721be1396e20\"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, I return to the\r\ntheme of inclusiveness, or People-to-People relations. I believe the\r\ncore value of inclusiveness is that everybody has something worthwhile\r\nto contribute. When you look at kids play a game, sometimes they\r\nexclude somebody in the group from playing, and it is often because\r\nthey think that the kid is not good enough and would make them lose.\r\nLikewise, when a company does not hire a senior or someone with\r\nspecial needs, it is thinking it will lose; in this case, lose money.\r\nWhen we speak the language of inclusiveness, we must change our\r\nmental models. The underlying philosophy is that each individual\r\nhas some fullness. Every person we classify as needy has something\r\nto contribute, and we need to encourage inclusion by recognising\r\npotential, not discounting it. For example, seniors have experience,\r\nautistic persons have the eye for detail, and poor families have\r\nstrengths to be harnessed. When we design policies and schemes,\r\nwe must always take this strength-based approach. Otherwise, programmes\r\nlike the Special Employment Credit, which is certainly useful, would\r\nnot work.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-d9d320fc-982c-42c2-af09-d583295726fa\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-d9d320fc-982c-42c2-af09-d583295726fa\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b26063d7-1485-41c3-8763-3b38f3d26a15\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b26063d7-1485-41c3-8763-3b38f3d26a15\"><!--a--></a>A sign of an inclusive\r\nsociety is a society that gives, not just takes.

The Government's reflex reaction is that strong safety\r\nnets erode economic incentives, undermine competitiveness, are unsustainable\r\nand increase moral hazard. There is, of course, truth in that. But\r\nwe know that it is a matter of balance, and I acknowledge the Government's\r\nefforts and Prime Minister's reassurance that the Government will\r\nredress the situation. But I think we need a more radical review,\r\nand not merely build on current policies and programmes. We need\r\nto find a new social contract that achieves a better balance between\r\ngrowth and equity, and between individual responsibility and social\r\ninsurance.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0b08424e-0880-446c-95e1-2ef229ffed4e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0b08424e-0880-446c-95e1-2ef229ffed4e\"><!--a--></a>The realities today are\r\ndifferent. Economically, there is much more uncertainty. In our first\r\n30 years we had one recession; in the last 15 years we had three.\r\nThe Gini coefficient continues its relentless climb, and it does\r\nnot even take into account the wealth gap. The sandwiched class\r\nare more stressed. Inadequacy in old age savings is showing its cracks.\r\nSocial mobility has fallen. Inflation is persistently high. So,\r\nfor example, I believe the balance between self insurance and pooled\r\ninsurance is skewed in healthcare, with the Government constantly\r\nforcing more into Medisave, a form of self-insurance. Singaporeans\r\nare not pooling their healthcare risks enough. Some 55% of healthcare spending\r\nis financed directly by patients; much higher than the case in other\r\ndeveloped countries in Asia. It is economically inefficient to have\r\nsuch high precautionary savings, much of which may never be used,\r\nexcept to be passed on to their kids.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1fee2c68-c27d-426c-a777-20cf39b8ccd8\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1fee2c68-c27d-426c-a777-20cf39b8ccd8\"><!--a--></a>Likewise, we have used\r\nhousing as a key way to store up retirement savings.

It would have been much better if we had controlled\r\nhousing asset inflation, kept the first home much more affordable,\r\nat around three times the buyer's annual income, and allowed much\r\nless of the CPF to be used for housing.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d708b9bb-db06-452c-8a5c-1e8cffe6a452\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d708b9bb-db06-452c-8a5c-1e8cffe6a452\"><!--a--></a>I am also very concerned\r\nabout the plight of people facing insufficient or declining incomes,\r\nas well as income inequality.

We also need better schemes to protect\r\nthe vulnerable from the risks of unemployment and income loss, while\r\navoiding moral hazard. Singapore Perspectives 2012, organised by\r\nthe Institute of Policy Studies, threw up many suggestions worth\r\nconsidering. And yet another major area of concern is that inflation\r\nhas risen so fast.

For this, we need longitudinal\r\nstudies to track people over time because cross sectional data gives\r\nan incomplete picture of reality. Likewise, there is also very little\r\nevaluation of incentive programmes. Have they worked? What is the\r\ndeadweight loss? There is sometimes a perverse effect in providing\r\nincentives.

We are changing domestically and\r\npolitically as well, as outlined by many Members in this House.\r\nIt is my firm belief that we need a different type of leadership,\r\nan adaptive leadership. This is not a straightforward kind of leadership.\r\nBut if we succeed, we will find each person, individually or in\r\ngroups, having something unique to offer to the community, because,\r\nnot in spite of, their differences. And when each of us starts contributing\r\nmeaningfully to the communities that we live in, we will feel more\r\nfully citizens of this country and this is when a place to stay\r\nbecomes a home.

I have three\r\npoints to make on this Budget.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1447</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-70d2fbf7-36ba-4932-904f-6e26c62efffb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-70d2fbf7-36ba-4932-904f-6e26c62efffb\"><!--a--></a>First, I note that whilst\r\nmost Members in the debate strongly endorsed the increased social\r\nspending which they see as a necessity, a couple have expressed\r\nreservations whether this could result in over-reliance on the Government.\r\nThese are valid concerns. However, I see this Budget as giving a\r\nstrong boost and support to self-reliance, independence and employment.\r\nConsider the employment of older Singaporeans and those with special\r\nneeds. By incentivising employers to employ older workers and the disabled\r\nthrough the SEC, the Budget aims at boosting employment, and therefore helps\r\nour elderly and disabled achieve independence and a greater sense\r\nof self-worth, which no amount of social assistance can provide.\r\nPeople want to lead dignified lives that come from earning an income\r\nthrough their own efforts. By making it easier for employers to\r\nemploy them and making it worthwhile for them to work through the\r\nWIS and the increased CPF rate for older workers, the Government\r\nhelps to boost independence and self-reliance. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5b9d6725-65bf-410b-ac83-d2d4f89b5af0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5b9d6725-65bf-410b-ac83-d2d4f89b5af0\"><!--a--></a>The Government is also\r\nsending a strong signal that everyone has a part to play, including\r\nthose who need help. It is clear that these Budget measures alone\r\nwill not make a great change in the employment of older workers\r\nor those with special needs. Employers have to take the leadership\r\nby redesigning their work processes, introducing technology and\r\nchanging their perceptions to view such workers as a resource and\r\nnot a liability. Take the case of Tony who suffers from polio and\r\nwho works in the dessert stall of a social enterprise called \"Dignity\r\nKitchen\". Dignity Kitchen went to great length to devise their own\r\ntraining programme and modify the workplace to make it disabled friendly,\r\nincluding installing a special machine to make it easier for a disabled\r\nworker to make bowls of noodles to serve customers. Tony will benefit\r\nfrom the WIS as well as a number of his colleagues who suffer from\r\nvarious disabilities, from hearing impairment to autism, some of\r\nwhom are below 35 years old. His employer will be so relieved to know\r\nthat his efforts to provide employment opportunities to the disabled\r\nis strongly supported by the Government and he will be able to enjoy\r\nthe Special Employment Credit of 16%, which is a significant savings\r\nfor him. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-96b2d3d3-d8c9-4de8-ad5e-74aed9557388\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-96b2d3d3-d8c9-4de8-ad5e-74aed9557388\"><!--a--></a>Second, this Budget marks\r\na shift in the Government's approach to middle-income earners. Greater\r\nsocial protection has now been extended to them as they too are affected\r\nby the rising cost of living, especially those sandwiched between\r\ncaring for their children and their frail elderly parents. I have\r\na resident in my constituency, a PMET, with two children and who\r\nis paying for his degree programme at a private educational institute.\r\nWhen his father's dementia worsened and he could no longer keep\r\nhim at home and had to send him to a nursing home, he really struggled\r\nto pay for the nursing home fees as he did not qualify for the subsidies.\r\nThis year's Budget will bring him great relief as he will now pay\r\nlower fees. Indeed, with the new subsidy framework in place, two\r\nthirds of all Singaporeans and 85% of our elderly will now receive\r\nsubsidies. This is a significant improvement and will benefit many\r\nmiddle-income families.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-32ce00ac-05d8-4ff7-91a7-74a2bfd8e1df\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-32ce00ac-05d8-4ff7-91a7-74a2bfd8e1df\"><!--a--></a>Johannes Jutting, the\r\nOECD's Head of Poverty recently wrote in an article entitled \"Rise\r\nof the Global Middle Class\". He said, \"In today's volatile situation,\r\nmost of the middle\r\nclass is one income shock from being pushed back into poverty.\"\r\nTo counter this risk, he suggested \"that social security programmes\r\nshould be gradually extended beyond social assistance\". Our situation\r\nin Singapore is not as severe as what he had described. Nevertheless,\r\nwe know that with an ageing population and rising costs, the middle-income\r\nearners are also feeling squeezed and greater Government support\r\nin healthcare will certainly help to reduce some of their concerns.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1448</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-117af96f-aebe-4242-a08d-c8ead41d89e2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-117af96f-aebe-4242-a08d-c8ead41d89e2\"><!--a--></a>Sir, other than healthcare,\r\nPMETs will also need stronger support in job placements and retraining.\r\nMany had worked only in one sector almost their entire career and\r\nfind it extremely difficult to switch to another sector or another\r\nindustry because of lack of skills or knowledge of the jobs available\r\nand, in many cases, also the difficulty of having to adjust to a\r\nmuch lower pay. It is not so easy for an engineer, for instance,\r\nwho has worked for 20 years in an electronic sector, to switch to\r\na sales or marketing job, but it is still possible with support\r\nand assistance. We do need greater labour market intervention measures\r\nto assist displaced PMETs.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-54630524-eb39-4bde-b13b-47f5379ac762\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-54630524-eb39-4bde-b13b-47f5379ac762\"><!--a--></a>My third point, Sir, is\r\nthat this Budget is pro-family and, more specifically, pro-children.\r\nMany more children will now be subsidised with the raising of the\r\nfamily income level to $3,500 for student care, and the introduction\r\nof the PCI for the enhanced subsidies under KIFAS, CFAC and student\r\ncare. More mothers could now go to work or remain in the workforce\r\nknowing that their children will be taken care of. This continued focus\r\non education and children's development is important to ensure that\r\nsocial mobility continues to be not only a hope but an achievable\r\nreality for our low-income Singaporeans. I dare say that many of\r\nus are here today in this Chamber because of social mobility. Although\r\nan MCYS survey shows that social mobility is still alive today, it\r\nalso warned that we cannot expect the same level of mobility for\r\nsubsequent cohorts.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-5263ae8a-d53f-42a9-a215-71394bb6fd2f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-5263ae8a-d53f-42a9-a215-71394bb6fd2f\"><!--a--></a>Let me at this point surface\r\nan issue raised by many women with me and which I hope that the\r\nNEA could look into. Many women from our low-income and needy families\r\nwant to work to earn an income to support their family or to supplement\r\nthe family income. Quite a number are also single mothers and may\r\nbe the sole breadwinners. They want to be self-reliant and avoid\r\nhaving to depend on the Government for social assistance. Despite\r\nour enhanced childcare subsidies, many of these women cannot work\r\noutside their home because they may not only have young children\r\nto take care of but also frail elderly parents.

The women strongly appealed to the Government to relax its\r\nrules prohibiting home kitchens.

The spirit of this\r\nBudget is to build an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore.\r\nIt is in this context then that we should view the appeal from our\r\nneedy women to allow them to operate home-based kitchens. Their\r\nmain desire is to be self-reliant and to enjoy a steady stream of\r\nincome doing something which they are really good at, which is cooking.\r\nThrough this, many of them aspire and hope to build a better future\r\nfor themselves and their children. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1449</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8bd1d99f-925b-4e92-983b-12f13a41b003\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8bd1d99f-925b-4e92-983b-12f13a41b003\"><!--a--></a>Still on the issue of\r\nwomen, Sir, I note our efforts to attract more women back to work through\r\nthe Flexi Works! scheme and the WOW!

To put things in perspective, by 2030, 20% of Singapore's population\r\nwould be above the age of 65.

The infrastructure and the planning\r\nstrategies needed to address this ageing problem take time to be\r\nrealised and we really need to act now before it is too late. We\r\nneed to take care of our own elderly population and that is why we\r\nneed to understand the urgency of ensuring that there is infrastructure\r\navailable to support the elderly now and in the future.

But when\r\nI heard some of the reasons cited, I was stunned and disappointed.\r\nWhat alarms me most is what we coined the NIMBY, or Not In My Backyard\r\nsyndrome \u2013 where people refuse to have facilities sited near their\r\nhomes, but far away. Other past examples include: in 2010, residents\r\nin Pasir Ris and Tampines objected to plans to build rental flats\r\nclose to their blocks and, in 2008, Serangoon Gardens residents\r\nwere up in arms when a proposal was made to convert a disused school\r\ninto dormitories for foreign workers. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-74a164f1-7013-48df-b7f8-9b7a35b57caa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-74a164f1-7013-48df-b7f8-9b7a35b57caa\"><!--a--></a>The problem lies in the\r\nfact that we do not enjoy the same sort of luxury of space as in\r\nother larger countries.

The flood alleviation effort was a national one\r\nfor Thais all over the country donated food, water and clothing\r\nto help their countrymen \u2013 far exceeding donations for previous\r\nyears.

The coming together of the Thais, I believe, shows how\r\npeople can come together and help one another because they have\r\na common national identity.

Firstly, the Ministry of Education can review\r\nthe future direction of our tertiary institutions to attract and\r\ntrain more talent in this field. Currently, four tertiary institutions\r\noffer courses on therapy and special education. We need more talent\r\ninterested in this field. According to a survey by the National\r\nResearch Institute at the University of Chicago, last year, physiotherapist\r\nand special needs educators ranked third and fifth respectively,\r\namong the happiest jobs in the US. Recently, MCYS launched a new\r\ncampaign to attract people to become social workers. Should we also start\r\na campaign to attract people to become physiotherapists? Secondly,\r\nMCYS can also help to look for talent pool that has not been explored,\r\nfor example, retired teachers with teaching experience. The Workforce\r\nDevelopment Agency can also encourage PMETs who are looking for\r\na mid-career change to become therapists. Housewives or women looking\r\nto re-join the workforce can also become therapy assistants. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8fea2ce4-4c1c-4fc3-844c-6589db152a08\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8fea2ce4-4c1c-4fc3-844c-6589db152a08\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcLang\">(<em class=\"ph i\">In English</em>): </span>In addition\r\nto these suggestions, may I, at this juncture, ask the Government\r\nto consider PCF's example of how they tackled the shortage of therapists. Through\r\ninnovative job design, PCF created a new position, five years ago,\r\nthe role of a Learning Support Coach for its organisation nationwide.\r\nThe main role of a Learning Support Coach, LSC in short, is to train\r\nand work with PCF teachers to support children with learning difficulties\r\nacross all PCF centres in Singapore. Its first LSC is 31-year-old Ms\r\nFiona Woo. She has trained 200 PCF teachers and 80 principals in\r\none-to-one sessions over the past five years. A former pre-school\r\nteacher, Ms Woo was qualified in special needs education and was\r\na Speech and Language Therapy Aide. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fd4b978a-9c61-4038-b251-146a97b09cd4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-fd4b978a-9c61-4038-b251-146a97b09cd4\"><!--a--></a>What does an LSC do? Ms\r\nWoo provides short-term direct early intervention support to PCF\r\npre-schoolers with learning difficulties in mainstream pre-school\r\nenvironment. She arms teachers with practical strategies and tips\r\non how to manage and include these children in their class. In addition,\r\nMs Woo teaches parents, caregivers, teachers and principals the\r\nways to help these children adapt to a mainstream pre-school environment\r\nwithout putting the spotlight on these children. She also coordinates\r\nthe specialist support for the children's special learning needs.\r\nAs part of her work, Ms Woo conducts screening tests for dyslexia\r\nin PCF. She shared with me her passion. I quote: \"The best reward\r\nfor me is to see the child with learning difficulties being able\r\nto socialise and learn well in mainstream school environment. That\r\nmeans I was able to make a difference in the child's life at his\r\nformative stage.\" </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-aa0ca5ad-8db4-4865-bc63-0381f01b1995\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-aa0ca5ad-8db4-4865-bc63-0381f01b1995\"><!--a--></a>I hope the Government\r\nwill look at this model of training and support used by PCF for the\r\nimpending DSP.

Can we explore the idea of nurturing\r\na healthy skills eco-system with job redesign for better skills\r\ndeployment? There is, indeed, a chance, and this is an opportune\r\ntime for us to develop a skills ecosystem, especially in our services sector\r\nwhere skills are more easily portable and transferable across industries\r\nand companies. For example, as part of Australia's Skills Ecosystem\r\nNational Project, Queensland Community Services and Health Industry\r\nTraining Council partnered two large not-for-profit healthcare service\r\nproviders in a job redesign project to tackle labour and service\r\nquality in aged care.

This way, we can better address the availability\r\nor development of skills as well as its application. For this to\r\nsucceed, we need to harness the full capacity of Government, the\r\nindustry and the community to open up new possibilities for skills, innovation\r\nand productivity. In her most recent <em class=\"ph i\">Harvard Business Review</em> article, \"Enriching\r\nthe Ecosystems\", Rosabeth Moss Kanter suggested that enhanced linkages and\r\ncollaborations between innovation, enterprises and jobs can bridge\r\nthe gaps between business, academia and policy leaders. The resulting\r\necosystems will generate more ideas, start-ups, company growth,\r\nglobally-competitive companies and, certainly, prosperity. A healthy\r\nskills ecosystem approach needs to be catalysed and nurtured by the\r\nGovernment no less, and not be left to market forces. There are\r\nstrong reasons for the Government to play an active role in this.\r\nPotential benefits could be: (1) better alignment with economic\r\nrestructuring; (2) support for both the workers as well as employers;\r\n(3) more efficient distribution of manpower resources; (4) ability\r\nto support job redesign\r\nthrough policies and interventions where needed; and (5) closer\r\nalignment with institutes of higher learning. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1461</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0b0cd41d-dd44-496b-b351-12201c6adea1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0b0cd41d-dd44-496b-b351-12201c6adea1\"><!--a--></a>In addition, we need the\r\nGovernment's long-term view and objectives to be met in order to\r\nsuccessfully future-proof our workforce.

Today's jobs are being challenged\r\nby tomorrow's demands, all too quickly. If we can maximise our manpower\r\ncapacity and capabilities through clever work organisation and job\r\nredesign, we have a chance to re-create value, increase productivity,\r\nprovide long-term employability and future-proof our workers for\r\nthe better. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4c0cf4a9-9919-484e-8cd4-a1e07d2d50e4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4c0cf4a9-9919-484e-8cd4-a1e07d2d50e4\"><!--a--></a>At first glance, these\r\nchallenges may appear difficult, but if I can liken it to another exhibit\r\nin the Singapore Show by Ms Genevieve Chua, entitled \"After the\r\nFlood\", these mono-chromatic images of forests with hand-painted\r\nlush are actually photographs of Singapore's secondary tropical\r\nrainforests in Orchard Road.

A society without conflict will be a society of\r\nfossils and die for the lack of change.

However, Sir, if we\r\nconsider this to be a public good, might we not accept some degree\r\nof inefficiency as a fair price to pay for the continued provision\r\nof an essential service? If there is always going to be a bus service\r\navailable for the citizens, sometimes a particular bus will operate\r\nat sub-optimal efficiency.

If one were to broaden the definition\r\nof successful, and accept a significant degree of ongoing expenditure,\r\none could include an example, such as London, where all public transport,\r\nincluding cycling and walking, has been brought under the aegis\r\nof a single body, Transport for London. This has enabled a transitional\r\napproach to transport strategy, where citizens are not seen as being\r\neither drivers, or cyclists, rail commuters or pedestrians, and\r\nbeing potential consumers that the different modalities and the\r\nproviders need to compete for. But, rather, recognising that any\r\ngiven individual can be all those at different times, and the correct\r\npublic transport infrastructure strategy can encourage a driver\r\nto become a passenger, a passenger to become a cyclist or a pedestrian.\r\nAnd in this model, instead of worrying about competition between\r\nand within a transport modality, this body has allowed a broader\r\napproach to be applied.

Sir, if we look at our transport operators,\r\ncan we even think of them as being privatised? Yes, they are responsible\r\nto shareholders and yes they can make significant profits, but both\r\nSMRT and SBS Transit have posted operating losses mostly due to\r\nincreases in staff and fuel costs. Last year, both companies submitted applications\r\nto the Public Transport Council (PTC) for total bus and rail fares\r\nto be raised by 2.8%. But instead, the PTC only approved an increase\r\nof 1%. If they were both truly private entities, they would both\r\nbe able to respond based on market demand. If a service was undersubscribed\r\nor unprofitable, they can cease to offer it, thus releasing resources\r\nand assets for use where they were needed. So while our public transport operators\r\nare private entities, they operate under significant constraints\r\nand burdens that reduce their flexibility and their ability to optimise\r\noperations in response to market forces. There are examples of privatised\r\ntransport systems where the public transport operators are encouraged\r\nand allowed to generate significant revenue from other sources,\r\nsuch as retail outlets and advertising, and thus cross subsidise\r\nfares. For this to work at maximal efficiency, a significant deregulation\r\nof our market would be needed, allowing true competition and true\r\nconsumer choice.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bd7da764-3b25-4eb4-9e73-91e276aaeb86\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-bd7da764-3b25-4eb4-9e73-91e276aaeb86\"><!--a--></a>We are neither properly\r\nprivatised nor adequately nationalised.

The duration of journey\r\nwas as predicted on my iPhone. Most of the time, there are seats\r\navailable on these services, and usually I get to read quite a few\r\nof my emails. At the end of today's sitting, I will walk over to\r\nClarke Quay Station, and take the North-East Line, and 25 minutes\r\nlater I will be in my constituency in Punggol. Our system does its job\r\nand does it well. It is safe, clean, and reliable. I agree that\r\nit has its faults and its problems, and any enterprise can always\r\nbe improved. One area that I feel needs further consideration and\r\ndevelopment is that of \"last mile\" connectivity. Rather than just assuming\r\nthat when the network is eventually dense enough, people will be\r\nhappy to cycle or walk to the nearest MRT station. We need to work\r\nproactively at changing and encouraging this mindset. We need to\r\nexamine footpaths, cycling facilities, lighting, access ramps and\r\nthe location of amenities, with as much attention to detail as we\r\ncan, as it is often these factors that alter the choice of the individual,\r\nwhere a choice is possible. I believe our current public transport\r\nsystem is one of the most efficient, reliable and pleasant in the\r\nworld, and I benefit from it on a daily basis. I look forward to its\r\ncontinued growth and development. Nevertheless, we have to consider\r\ndeeply where we want to go from here.

There are about 150,000 SMEs\r\nin Singapore, making up 99% of all enterprises. They contribute\r\nto about half of Singapore's GDP and employ about 60% of the workforce.\r\nClearly, the SME sector is critical in our drive towards higher\r\nproductivity and real wage growth. We must do all we can to uplift\r\nthe SMEs as we restructure our economy. This Budget provides some support\r\nfor SMEs, and I believe more can be done.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f0d280f7-ac1b-4c04-b854-72e1a106c088\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f0d280f7-ac1b-4c04-b854-72e1a106c088\"><!--a--></a>One area often cited as\r\na major challenge facing SMEs is that of manpower, especially skilled\r\nmanpower. The growth of successful SMEs is often constrained by their\r\nability to attract more capable and talented Singaporeans to work\r\nfor them. Many successful SMEs pay competitive salaries and offer\r\nexciting career prospects, yet they often get overlooked as graduates\r\nmake a beeline to jobs in MNCs and the Civil Service.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c5412aa7-c3a7-4c7a-83b3-1357582df7b6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c5412aa7-c3a7-4c7a-83b3-1357582df7b6\"><!--a--></a>Our Government scholarship\r\nsystem has been successful in bringing in and retaining many bright,\r\nyoung Singaporeans in the public sector. I would like to propose\r\nthe introduction of an SME scholarship programme to help bring more\r\ntalent into SMEs. The Government could work in collaboration with\r\nbusiness federations and SME associations to create and administer\r\nthis programme, which should be done on a cost-sharing basis. Promising\r\nSMEs could then be given funding to award scholarships to top JC\r\nand Polytechnic students who, upon graduation, will return to work\r\nfor them for a minimum number of years, and hopefully stay longer\r\nto grow the business further. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-58434d8c-130d-47c3-8e1d-707b8c6d9a5e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-58434d8c-130d-47c3-8e1d-707b8c6d9a5e\"><!--a--></a>I am glad that this Budget\r\nhas made it easier for companies to claim Productivity and Innovation\r\nCredit (PIC) benefits on their in-house training costs, by removing\r\nthe requirement to have these training programmes certified by WDA\r\nor ITE. I would urge the Government to take a step further and provide\r\nmore funding for On-the-Job Training (OJT). OJT is recognised as\r\none of the most effective forms of training, especially for those\r\nin vocational work. There should be greater government funding for\r\ncompanies to provide structured OJT programmes for their workers\r\nand new hires. This could include payroll subsidies and more funding\r\nfor OJT supervisor training. Boosting OJT subsidies could help companies\r\novercome their resistance to hiring Singaporean workers who may\r\nlack the necessary skills and experience. In addition, workers do\r\nnot need to miss work in order to attend training.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-42f8b1c1-20bd-4b6e-84fb-942a0caf377e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-42f8b1c1-20bd-4b6e-84fb-942a0caf377e\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like to now\r\nshare some thoughts on the social development initiatives in the\r\nBudget. The Government has always warned that we must avoid the\r\npath of excessive social spending, which could result in crippling\r\npublic debts. While I share the Government's concern about uncontrolled\r\nspending or unsustainable social entitlements, this should not be\r\na convenient excuse to hold back much needed social investments.\r\nIncome inequality in Singapore is already among the highest in the developed\r\nworld. There is much research that has pointed to the detrimental\r\neffects that income inequality could have on a society, including\r\nreduced social mobility, higher crime rates and increased social\r\ntension. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1472</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-20da92b3-2214-476e-83e9-219eec9582d5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-20da92b3-2214-476e-83e9-219eec9582d5\"><!--a--></a>There is a pressing need to reform our\r\nsocial compact to not just contain, but reduce income inequality.\r\nWe also have a moral obligation to provide more help to our elderly citizens,\r\nwho built this nation to what we enjoy now. I affirm the Budget's\r\nfocus towards countering the adverse implications of our growing\r\nincome gap. The Silver Housing Bonus is a good attempt to help increase\r\nthe retirement incomes of the elderly. However, I believe the Bonus\r\nwould be more attractive if the elderly received a greater portion\r\nof the proceeds from the sale of their previous flats in cash, rather\r\nthan having most of it returned to their CPF accounts. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-73b18700-db5a-4354-9607-772b27200e64\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-73b18700-db5a-4354-9607-772b27200e64\"><!--a--></a>In the example that the\r\nFinance Minister gave in his speech, the elderly couple receives\r\nonly $23,000 in cash, or about 9% of their net proceeds from the\r\nsale of their flat, even after the Silver Housing Bonus. This is\r\nbecause, to benefit from the Silver Housing Bonus, flat owners must\r\nuse the cash proceeds from the sale of their previous flat to top\r\nup their CPF Retirement Accounts to the Minimum Sum. I propose that\r\nthey be allowed to pledge the value of their new studio apartment\r\ntowards meeting up to half of the Minimum Sum. This will allow them\r\nto get more cash after the sale of their previous flat.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4d019ef8-2d86-43e2-bce6-03a7670a3a9c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4d019ef8-2d86-43e2-bce6-03a7670a3a9c\"><!--a--></a>Since they will still\r\nbe meeting their Minimum Sum, there is no need to apportion $5,000\r\nfrom the Silver Housing Bonus to their CPF Retirement Accounts.\r\nThe full $20,000 Silver Housing Bonus could be given to them in\r\ncash. While a larger Retirement Account may get them more per month\r\nin CPF LIFE annuity pay-outs, many senior citizens may have more\r\nimmediate needs for cash, for example, to pay their medical bills.\r\nWhy not give them this option to have more cash on hand? If they\r\nwant higher annuity pay-outs, they can always voluntarily top up\r\ntheir CPF Retirement Accounts. In any case, most elderly folks prefer\r\nto remain in their current homes, rather than get displaced to unfamiliar\r\nsurroundings in their old age. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-db0b6bc7-923d-4f37-b70e-071ed2cde47d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-db0b6bc7-923d-4f37-b70e-071ed2cde47d\"><!--a--></a>To give the elderly more\r\nchoices, the Lease Buyback Scheme should be extended to owners of\r\n4-room or larger flats, just like the Silver Housing Bonus. Currently,\r\nonly owners of 3-room or smaller flats are eligible. This could\r\nbe a reason for the low take-up rate. An enhanced Lease Buyback\r\nScheme will enable more of our elderly to age in place, and to live\r\ntheir golden years in familiar surroundings, without having to worry too\r\nmuch about finances.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1011ca38-f3c7-4878-acb3-b9dcf1a0cdd1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1011ca38-f3c7-4878-acb3-b9dcf1a0cdd1\"><!--a--></a>Sir, moving on to eldercare,\r\nI think many families will welcome the additional grant for hiring\r\nforeign maids to help them care for infirm elderly parents. This\r\ngrant adds to the existing concession for households with elderly\r\npersons. But instead of all these grants and concessions, I suggest\r\ncompletely doing away with the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy for\r\nthese families, so as to provide further relief for them and simplify administration.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cbb73777-89cc-4173-92bd-d7d89f8746d7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-cbb73777-89cc-4173-92bd-d7d89f8746d7\"><!--a--></a>Extending the maximum\r\nMediShield coverage age from 85 to 90 years old is a move in the\r\nright direction.

We should do all we can to help this small group of seniors\r\nwho have worked tirelessly to build up Singapore to what it is today,\r\ninstead of pulling the rug from under their feet when they need\r\nit the most.

Younger, low-income families also do\r\nnot get their full GST payments back. To achieve its aim, GST Vouchers\r\nshould cover all HDB households whose incomes are within the bottom\r\n20%.

So, while they are doing OJT, they can pick up the skills\r\nand this will make Singaporean workers a bit more employable.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-28a18b5d-fb13-4efa-8973-9c2d46474bee\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-28a18b5d-fb13-4efa-8973-9c2d46474bee\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9ac752a4-8fdd-4612-b6d0-769f30729f98\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9ac752a4-8fdd-4612-b6d0-769f30729f98\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Ang Hin Kee</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Well, I\r\nsuppose, therefore, then what he alluded to is his opinion, and\r\nmy question was really did this insight come from his reading, his\r\nviews or his interactions with industry associations or with clusters\r\nof SMEs?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-c480530f-c3ea-4408-b080-fae9bb9427e7\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-c480530f-c3ea-4408-b080-fae9bb9427e7\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9b6d0ace-6055-434f-bfd1-1ec945f70d35\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9b6d0ace-6055-434f-bfd1-1ec945f70d35\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Speaker, my insights came from various sources, including research\r\non my own.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-09142419-3c5d-45bf-9009-a2259363a27b\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-09142419-3c5d-45bf-9009-a2259363a27b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d55eea23-9e84-48f0-ac0e-c2a4ffc841c6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d55eea23-9e84-48f0-ac0e-c2a4ffc841c6\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Dr Janil Puthucheary.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-4c3a26b0-a503-4f85-89d0-ccb41b15ef5b\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-4c3a26b0-a503-4f85-89d0-ccb41b15ef5b\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c863b961-534c-427b-8c64-74bf7cb64b63\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c863b961-534c-427b-8c64-74bf7cb64b63\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Janil Puthucheary</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr\r\nSpeaker, I have a question for the hon Mr Gerald Giam.

Today,\r\nI would like to start my speech on an inclusive society in relation\r\nto policy making. All these years, our policies have displayed strengths\r\nin operational excellence and effective outcome, the success of\r\nwhich had been the envy of many countries, especially those policies\r\nthat steered Singapore out of storms, the global financial crises, SARS,\r\nthe Asian Financial Crisis and so on. We have been very successful\r\nin anticipating problems and solving them. My question is whether\r\nwe could have done better in the implementation of population policy\r\nrecently; in relation to anticipating the impending stress on the\r\nlocals, and on all the infrastructure demand resulting from such\r\npolicies. My next question is whether it is worthwhile and timely\r\nto modify our policy-making model. Policy making that not only emphasises\r\nthe technical, on what is feasible or unfeasible, but also on political\r\nconstraint. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b58ecdcf-c07e-4599-b0e0-97f55fddd32d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b58ecdcf-c07e-4599-b0e0-97f55fddd32d\"><!--a--></a>I feel that we need to\r\nmake adjustment on our policy making that caters to the sophistication\r\nof today's populace. The rational model of policy making may be\r\nmore suitable than the incremental model. The rational model explores\r\nall alternatives and looks at the consequences of each alternative\r\nstrategy and calculation of the probability of these occurrences.\r\nThe incremental model gives analysis to a few somewhat familiar policy\r\nalternatives differing only marginally from the status quo; it gives\r\ngreater analytical preoccupation with side effects to be remedied\r\nlater, featuring sequence of trial, oversights and revised trials.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-010c34b4-d0b2-4d13-a635-a0c98f4368d6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-010c34b4-d0b2-4d13-a635-a0c98f4368d6\"><!--a--></a>We all know that public\r\npolicy must be multi-disciplinary. This means that policies produced\r\nshould be inter-crossed among fields, such as MOF, MOH, MCYS, MOT\r\nand so on. Often, policies made by one Ministry can be synergised\r\nwith other Ministries to minimise duplication of efforts and for\r\na better outcome. Sir, is this practice being exercised in earnest\r\nin our Ministries, are avenues in place to strengthen this approach in\r\npolicy making among our Ministries, from formulation stage to implementation stage?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-592022ec-53a8-4da9-ae16-dfe766d0e805\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-592022ec-53a8-4da9-ae16-dfe766d0e805\"><!--a--></a>Better skills on interpersonal\r\nnuances that help connect better with the end users are an important\r\ntool.

This approach begets the question whether our present\r\nfeedback system is robust enough, and whether our service-centric\r\nculture is efficient. As we grapple with increasingly complex issues,\r\ncompelling various differing sections of society and higher expectations\r\nof the masses, there is a need for more options on the importance\r\nof being in touch on the ground in policy making.

Sir, Budget feedback has been largely positive. Many praised\r\nthe efforts to address retirement adequacy, healthcare, education, demographic\r\nconcerns and rising social deficits. Singaporeans warmly welcomed\r\nsteps to bridge income gaps, reinstate older workers' CPF rates,\r\nmake permanent GST vouchers, higher wages for social and healthcare\r\nworkers, and also welcomed specific steps to upgrade and employ\r\nthe seniors, the disabled and needy Singaporeans. But the Budget\r\nis not all a bed of roses. The business sector felt thorned by the\r\nmeasures to tighten foreign workers. We want to reduce our reliance\r\non foreign workers, but SMEs struggle with cost concerns. Many employers\r\nI spoke to acknowledged that there are too many foreigners. But\r\nwhen asked whether they would employ Singaporeans, they said, \"Unlikely,\r\nbecause it costs more and Singaporeans do not want to do the job!\"\r\nFurther, many SMEs feel choked by rising rentals, especially those\r\nwho are in the REITs property. This has been spoken about by many\r\nof the Members here. And it makes me wonder: have we not learnt\r\nfrom the global financial meltdown? Real businesses should be better prioritised\r\nagainst rent-maximising financial instruments. There are 160,000\r\nSMEs that contribute about half of our GDP and employ more than\r\nhalf of our workforce. With negative headwinds in sight, businesses\r\nface triple whammies. SMEs do need some more help to get fitter.\r\nSo I see the foreign-worker tightening measure as a form of an overdue\r\nbusiness diet plan. We want fitter, not fatter companies. We want\r\nlean and mean productivity, not borrowed cheap labour. Health brings\r\nwealth. But how to fast and eat less overnight and with no pain?\r\nIt is not possible. Old habits do die hard.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0e9b0f3e-af65-4058-b8de-b7238abdcb25\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0e9b0f3e-af65-4058-b8de-b7238abdcb25\"><!--a--></a>But the good news is that\r\nthe Minister for Finance is allowing time and also giving out vitamins\r\nand supplements to give companies the energy boost while achieving\r\ntheir fitness goals.

As Singapore Inc transforms, our national balance\r\nsheet may look something like this \u2212 if I could refer Members to\r\nthe handout that has just been given out. Note that this is a simplified\r\nversion for discussion purposes, but it offers a sufficient peek\r\ninto Singapore's position amidst changing times. On the left hand\r\nside, you will see that those are our assets. Assets are, of course,\r\nour revenue generators and they comprise human capital, economic\r\ncapital, natural capital and infrastructural capital. On the right\r\nhand side, normally called \"liabilities\" that requires paying up,\r\nwe have social obligations or social deficits which this Budget\r\nseeks to address quite a lot of them, and they include things like\r\nsocial inclusion of an ageing population, the poor, the disadvantaged;\r\nsocial cohesion, that of our social fabric; social disconnect of\r\na transactional urban city environment; and social justice, especially\r\nin the midst of globalisation and the spread of Arab Spring and\r\nOccupy Wall Street movements. Last but not least, we have equity,\r\nwhich are existing financial and social resources that help us to\r\nweather rainy days. And we saw this financial equity prowess during\r\nthe recent financial crisis. It gives us the resources to keep business\r\nrunning, invest in training and keep life as normal as possible.\r\nIt gives us great comfort and confidence. Then, there is also this\r\nlayer on social equity which, in fact, if you remember, saved our\r\nnation from tearing apart during the SARS scare and 911. Without\r\nthem, Singapore could be a very different place today.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fa9e4203-e8ea-4748-b0ca-c5c6cd311c16\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-fa9e4203-e8ea-4748-b0ca-c5c6cd311c16\"><!--a--></a>Currently, our balance\r\nsheet looks good.

Not just yet.\r\nIf we project this sheet into the year 2030, with ageing demography\r\nand low fertility, what would it look like? We call ourselves \"a\r\ncity in a garden\". Indeed, our present condition looks like a flower,\r\nsmells like a flower, blooms like a flower, but will also wither\r\nlike a flower, if we do not provide a counterweight to market failures\r\nand externalities associated with growth.

Since 2004, employers\r\nimplementing PMBS enjoy a higher tax deduction cap for medical expenses of\r\nup to 2% of their employees' remuneration, compared to 1% for those\r\nwho are not. However, to qualify for the tax incentive, the companies\r\nmust either contribute at least 1% of the employees' monthly salary\r\ninto their Medisave Account or fully subsidise the employees' Shield\r\npremium. From our experience, companies who qualify by making 1%\r\nMedisave contribution have not been effective in ensuring that all\r\nemployees purchase any form of insurance, including the Shield plan,\r\nand many continue with the Group Hospitalisation and Surgical (GHS)\r\nInsurance Scheme, which is a duplication and not portable. To require\r\nthat only full subsidy can qualify for tax incentive has been prohibitive\r\nas the cost of full subsidy is higher than the cost of GHS coverage.\r\nAs a result, many companies found it costly and no incentive to\r\nswitch to the PMBS scheme. I would like to suggest that MOF review\r\nthe tax incentive criteria to allow companies who fund at least\r\nhalf of the Shield premium to also qualify for the tax incentive.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-89f3eec4-14c4-460e-a746-3abb2b625286\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-89f3eec4-14c4-460e-a746-3abb2b625286\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I am happy to see\r\nthat the enhancements to our Workfare scheme to benefit SPED graduates\r\nand those with disabilities.

During the Ming\r\ndynasty, a man fervently prayed everyday in the middle of the night\r\nfor several years. One day, a deity was moved by his devotion and\r\nappeared to him. The deity said, \"You are a very devoted believer\r\nas you pray to the heavens every day. Tell me, what your wishes\r\nare so that I can fulfil them for you.\" The man thought for a while\r\nand answered, \"I do not wish for anything. I just want to lack nothing,\r\ntravel round the world and be of good health and finally die peacefully.\"\r\nAfter listening to the man, the deity smiled, \"What you are asking\r\nfor is the good fortune that can only be enjoyed by deities. If\r\nyou have asked for earthly things, I can easily grant your wish.\r\nBut to live like a god, I'm sorry, is something I can't give.\" </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e1826ad1-c02c-4499-b949-ef0896e8dd8b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e1826ad1-c02c-4499-b949-ef0896e8dd8b\"><!--a--></a>This story reminds us that we are after\r\nall human beings.

We cannot listen to some of the unrealistic pictures\r\nor mirage painted by some politicians and think that they are real.\r\nBecause what Singapore achieves today is the result of national\r\nstability, our people's hard work and the ability to stay united\r\nin difficulties. Currently, our world is intensely competitive,\r\njust as the recently deceased superstar Feng Feifei sang, \"The world\r\nchanges faster than the weather.\" During this period while many\r\ncountries are facing rising unemployment, it is commendable that\r\nwe have full employment. Real wages in many countries are stagnant\r\nbut we have achieved real wage growth for our workers. The purpose\r\nof this Budget is to sustain Singapore's pragmatic and inclusive\r\ngrowth. We want to encourage the tripartite partners to continue\r\nworking together.

Local companies need to learn from a recent <em class=\"ph i\">Straits\r\nTimes</em> report and turn \"bad\" jobs in service sector into \"good\"\r\njobs. The report stated that some American companies are upgrading jobs\r\nto attract more local workers. Singaporean businesses should follow\r\nsuit, of course. I am aware of some local businesses, such as Wing\r\nTai, which have been doing a good job in this aspect.

Initially, she did not believe\r\nthe story as she knew Zengzi was a good man, so she continued weaving\r\nher cloth, ignoring the person. But one after another, several people\r\ncame and said Zengzi had killed someone. Thus, she became uneasy\r\nand decided to put down her work and look for her son to find out\r\nthe truth. This story from the Analects tells us that even the trust\r\nbetween mother and son can be breached, what more other types of\r\nrelationships. A mistruth, after being repeated many times, will\r\nbegin to sound like the truth. If we keep calling a deer a horse, after\r\nsome time people will believe that the deer is indeed a horse.

Eventually, most CEOs understand\r\nthe need to restructure the economy so that we are less reliant\r\non foreign workers for future growth. However, they need more help\r\nin a few areas.

Prof Ton argued that these service jobs are not bad in nature.\r\nIf you invest enough on the service worker and improve the hygiene\r\nfactors, these service jobs can be attractive.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-169c029f-7386-4cf4-bb5e-0f5eca345922\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-169c029f-7386-4cf4-bb5e-0f5eca345922\"><!--a--></a>Singaporeans are practical.\r\nWe have to increase the pay substantially to attract Singaporeans,\r\namongst other measures.

I visited the areas a few times alone and unannounced.\r\nI took photographs of the state of the area and sent it to the Jurong\r\nTown Council. The cleaning contractor did not improve despite repeated\r\nwarnings, citing difficulties in getting workers; Singaporeans do\r\nnot want to work for them, and all the other excuses. As a result,\r\nthe Jurong Town Council called for a new tender and awarded the\r\njob to a new contractor who subsequently performed very well. The performance\r\nof the new contractor was so good that the previously dirty precinct\r\nwas awarded the \"A litter-free Environment\" and the award was given\r\nout by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for the Environment and\r\nWater Resources on 15 January this year. However, the change in\r\nthe contractor came with a price. The new contract was about 30%\r\nhigher than the last contract, despite the new contract being one\r\nof the cheapest quotes submitted. The new contractor cited reasons\r\nsuch as higher foreign worker levy, the need to pay more to hire\r\nSingaporeans and that they deploy better equipment, etc, to justify\r\nthe higher price. For this case, the Jurong Town Council has absorbed\r\nthe increase in cost and did not pass it on to the residents. If\r\nall the cleaning contractors increase their price upon renewal,\r\nthe situation can be tricky. Are Singaporeans prepared to pay more\r\nas we hire more Singaporeans to work in the service sector?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1489</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a5dd34af-01a2-428e-9506-3dad9e3eaaff\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a5dd34af-01a2-428e-9506-3dad9e3eaaff\"><!--a--></a>In this respect, the Government\r\nagencies, as the largest consumer of services, could take a lead\r\nto pay the increase in costs for the outsourced services such as\r\ncleaning, security, construction, etc, provided that the increases\r\nare due to the higher cost of paying Singaporean workers. \u7f8a\u6bdb\u51fa\u5728\u7f8a\u8eab\u4e0a. While\r\nI am tempted to suggest more spending, I am quite mindful of how\r\nto fund them. The Government cannot keep increasing expenditure\r\nand run into deficit. At some point in time, Singaporeans have to share\r\nthe costs. Perhaps, those who are in the higher income brackets\r\nmay have to pay more, as suggested by Mr Hri Kumar and Ms Denise\r\nPhua yesterday, so that we can move towards a more inclusive society.\r\nWe do not want to end up like other countries whereby their social\r\nspending exceeds the Government's ability to pay and hence we have\r\nto burden the next generation.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-616ace14-1ec5-450f-9b92-edded106ed4f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-616ace14-1ec5-450f-9b92-edded106ed4f\"><!--a--></a>Sir, in conclusion, we\r\nare thankful that this Budget provides timely assistance to the special\r\nneeds community though we hope MOM could do more to induce companies\r\nto hire PWDs.

When\r\nI initially came here, I only had two main points I wanted to make\r\nbut after listening to a very intriguing speech by Mr Chen Show\r\nMao, there are a couple of ideas that can be detailed and, hopefully,\r\nwe can come up with some very good suggestions for this Budget indeed.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c471a248-7f37-44d6-97bd-be59efc8fced\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c471a248-7f37-44d6-97bd-be59efc8fced\"><!--a--></a>Let me start with what I most welcome\r\nabout this Budget. What is truly heart-warming about this Budget\r\nis the emphasis on helping the needy and the vulnerable. For many\r\nof us who have been helping on the ground, we have seen the real\r\nissues that the vulnerable groups suffer. The added measures in\r\nthis Budget will help those groups in a great many ways. I filed\r\nmore than 10 cuts for the COS, which I will go into the details of\r\nhow these things may work out in different Ministries, and I would\r\nnot repeat that here.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1490</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c02477bf-193a-4a3f-9bb1-ffb2b7f69075\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c02477bf-193a-4a3f-9bb1-ffb2b7f69075\"><!--a--></a>The second aspect that\r\nis very important is the emphasis on balancing the Budget. Now,\r\nthis has been brought up by many speakers and I am happy that speakers\r\non both sides of the House agree with this. Because this is, in\r\nmany other places, not automatically something that people would\r\nagree with. In fact, one of the things that has been of greatest\r\nconcern to me is that in many of the developed and what you might term\r\n\"First World democracies\", there is a tremendous pressure for parties\r\non both sides to spend more, to basically say \"Let's do more\". Because\r\nwhat is the benefit of saying \"Let's do more\"? It means that you\r\ncan spend money on a particular group and get the support of that\r\ngroup. Now, where does that money come from? Invariably, from the Government.\r\nIt is always \"Let's do more\", and Government pays more.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3157a7ea-83fc-48cf-a1a6-278d9a0b11b0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3157a7ea-83fc-48cf-a1a6-278d9a0b11b0\"><!--a--></a>Now, the impact of doing\r\nthat, of course, is that someone ultimately has to pay the price.\r\nThat price can be paid in two ways. One, you go on a deficit. If\r\nyou go on a deficit, everything may look fine for the moment but,\r\nyou know, sometime in the future, the future generations will have\r\nto pay the price which is what is happening in many developed countries\r\nnow. The second way we can pay the price is with higher taxes. Now,\r\nin most developed countries, the taxes are substantially more than\r\nSingapore. Median income earners will easily pay more than 30% to\r\n40% tax, something which is almost unheard of here. And this has\r\nhappened over the years in a sort of creeping fashion because governments\r\nalways say, \"Let's do more, let's spend more.\" And, of course, they\r\nnever talk of where this money is going to come from. So, eventually,\r\nthe money comes from the people because, ultimately, government\r\nis from the people and the people have to pay the price at some\r\npoint.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-15d1a562-c13d-4b65-a27f-91e08b90187b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-15d1a562-c13d-4b65-a27f-91e08b90187b\"><!--a--></a>One of the greatest gifts\r\nthat we have received from our previous generations of leaders is\r\nthat they have actually strived to balance the Budget so we do not\r\nhave to carry the burden of the deficits of a previous generation.\r\nAnd I think one of the most important gifts that we can give to\r\nthe next generation is not to pass on the burden of our deficits.\r\nSo, in this regard, I know that many speakers here have highlighted\r\nareas where they think more can be done, and I think many of these\r\ncome from noble motivations and many of these are in areas that\r\nall of us feel for and understand. But the reality is that if you\r\nagree that balancing the Budget is an important objective, then\r\nthe real question is what trade-offs do you make when you want to\r\ndo more, and I think this is the real challenge we face.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-aa884dd5-f7c0-48eb-afe0-d693749461df\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-aa884dd5-f7c0-48eb-afe0-d693749461df\"><!--a--></a>This is why Mr Chen's\r\nspeech was particularly intriguing.

As long as it\r\nis a good idea, I think it is something we can all run with. Initially,\r\nI must say that some parts of Mr Chen's speech were a little bit hurtful.\r\nI will just flag this just out of openness. The part that I found\r\nhurtful was when he started off by saying the Government has heeded\r\nthe call for inclusive growth. That is our long-held belief. Now,\r\nthe insinuation from this is that the Government previously did\r\nnot care about inclusive growth but it is something that he had\r\npersonally believed in all the time.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-4bc11379-5357-471f-b785-ebd618bf9702\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-4bc11379-5357-471f-b785-ebd618bf9702\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-03f01371-4c8b-48ed-8c06-b41d338aaa0f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-03f01371-4c8b-48ed-8c06-b41d338aaa0f\"><!--a--></a>And then he goes on to highlight many\r\ndifferent areas where he thinks more can be done, particularly in\r\nrelation to the needy groups and vulnerable groups, and he says, \"Let's\r\ndo more, let's do more, let's do more.\" But \"Let's do more\" is a\r\nwonderful rallying cry because it does two things. First of all,\r\nby highlighting the vulnerable groups, he shows that he understands\r\ntheir plight; second, by saying \"Let's do more\", he is suggesting\r\nthat the Government is not doing enough. In that sense, it is a\r\nwonderful way to score political points which is a fair game. But\r\nI found it a bit hurtful because it suggested we were not doing\r\nenough and we did not care. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1491</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-aa4b8e27-ff51-4cb6-a645-34ec955f40be\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-aa4b8e27-ff51-4cb6-a645-34ec955f40be\"><!--a--></a>The message that we did\r\nnot care came out even more strongly in his third point when he\r\nsays the burden of the vulnerable group \"should not be seen as a\r\nchallenge or a problem\", thereby attributing to the Government and\r\nthe PAP, I guess by insinuation, that we had somewhat categorised\r\nthem as a challenge or problem, and he came up with a new word.\r\nHe said, \"They should be seen as investments\", thereby putting a positive\r\nspin to it. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a9a7b6e2-132a-4996-872b-46bda89422b9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a9a7b6e2-132a-4996-872b-46bda89422b9\"><!--a--></a>The message he wanted\r\nto convey here again is that we did not care, but, of course, he\r\ndid and he was going to invest in it.

I certainly hope that he will\r\nnot make further insinuations against the character or the heart\r\nof our party because we certainly share the same belief that this\r\nvulnerable group should be helped and it is in this spirit that\r\nI look at the remaining points. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-69106c54-0b71-4cf1-ad06-0b4425ef03eb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-69106c54-0b71-4cf1-ad06-0b4425ef03eb\"><!--a--></a>I think the genius of\r\nMr Chen's idea was the idea of an investment that pays for itself.

I know he used the word\r\n\"investment\" to put a positive spin to it but, unfortunately for me,\r\nthe term \"investment\" \u2013 maybe because I was scarred in my younger\r\ndays \u2013 does not have quite so positive a connotation. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0bfdb64b-f09a-4759-b5a0-6b849ac7159f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0bfdb64b-f09a-4759-b5a0-6b849ac7159f\"><!--a--></a>One of the very early\r\nexperiences that I had with a good investment was an email I received\r\nwhile I was a student, and it came from a person who claimed to\r\nbe the second son of the President of Nigeria.

I was a student, I did not have $10,000 at that time, so I\r\nnever took part in that investment. But I subsequently learnt that\r\nthis was a scam.

But it might well be that, in Mr Chen's case, these investments\r\nare genuine and pay for themselves. We do not know based on the\r\nlevel of detail he gave us. Let me just press for some details. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a628d576-1c4f-424e-a319-48f88995fe11\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a628d576-1c4f-424e-a319-48f88995fe11\"><!--a--></a>The first point he made\r\nwas about investing in social capital. He was saying that we need\r\nto invest in social capital \u2013 in the elderly, the disabled and the\r\npoor, and I agree. In fact, from what I have seen, that is one of\r\nthe most fulfilling things that we can do as a Member of Parliament.\r\nWe look for the vulnerable groups, we help them out in the meantime and we try\r\nand empower them in the long term. But we are not as smart as him\r\nbecause our investments certainly incur costs; they are certainly\r\nnot self-funding. What I was really impressed by was when Mr Chen\r\nloudly shouted, \"Let's do more\"; he also said that since these are\r\ninvestments, we do not have to make provisions for them in the Budget,\r\nwe do not have to raise any revenues at all. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1492</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8b494bfb-1b9a-47c2-b61e-ddf54652098f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8b494bfb-1b9a-47c2-b61e-ddf54652098f\"><!--a--></a>I was astounded by that.\r\nI thought maybe we have to put an outlay first. Even the Nigerian\r\nscheme required you to put $10,000 upfront. But Mr Chen\u20ac\u02dcs scheme\r\ndoes not even require a short-term provision. It is not even a deficit\r\nfor one year. No, no, no. It will pay for itself because it is an\r\ninvestment. So, I would like him to explain how he expects these\r\nschemes to pay for themselves because, if they do, I will wholeheartedly\r\nsupport it. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-47804c5b-09f0-4f42-81c4-91f17ab84a89\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-47804c5b-09f0-4f42-81c4-91f17ab84a89\"><!--a--></a>He also mentioned that\r\nwe need to set up agencies to think about this, for example, agencies\r\nlike EDB, A*STAR and SPRING. As far as I know, these agencies employ hundreds\r\nof people and there is a cost in doing it. Not only that, but there\r\nare already agencies like CDCs, e2i and SCORE that do look out for\r\nhelp for these vulnerable groups. So, what I am really curious about\r\nis why he intends to set up additional agencies and, more importantly,\r\nhow these additional agencies will pay for themselves? Because if that\r\nis indeed the case, then I have no qualms at all setting it up.\r\nBut I myself still struggle to think about how the underlying principle\r\nthat you can have an investment that requires no revenue provisions\r\nand which will yield wonderful returns. And, mind you, the wonderful\r\nreturns are really good because it is not just economic returns,\r\nit is also social capital and cultural returns. It is even better\r\nthan the Nigerian scheme because you do not have to put in any money\r\nat all and you get more than money in return. I would wholeheartedly\r\nendorse it but I need the details, the nuts and bolts, on how this would\r\nwork. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-875b0e7c-92e4-4d5b-b4f6-c70b7d9b10ba\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-875b0e7c-92e4-4d5b-b4f6-c70b7d9b10ba\"><!--a--></a>And it is not just the\r\nelderly, the disabled and the poor that he is interested in. He\r\nalso said that these same ideas can go into education and schools\r\ntraining our workers for jobs and empowering our workers. Again,\r\nall wonderful things, and all things which there are already many\r\nagencies and institutions set up to deal with. So, again, what I would\r\nlike to hear from Mr Chen is how exactly we can do this \"Let's do\r\nmore\" without any requirement to raise the revenues or costs to\r\nmeet these demands. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-14e480d0-0bc4-4d7b-966f-0f8087d68323\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-14e480d0-0bc4-4d7b-966f-0f8087d68323\"><!--a--></a>One other area, foreign\r\nworker dependency, which was quite interesting, actually has, I\r\nwould say, two sides to it. Mr Chen recommended in his speech that\r\nwe should reduce the dependency. He recognised that we are reducing\r\nthe dependency ratio, and then he asked the rhetorical question,\r\n\"How effective will the proposed measures be in reducing our dependence\r\non foreign workers?\" The insinuation and, of course, he then repeated\r\nhis favourite phrase, \"Let's do more\". So, when we put these two\r\nstatements together, the inference we draw is that the current measures\r\nare not enough to stem the inflow of foreign workers. I must say\r\nthere is some irony in that this is coming from a man who spent\r\nmore than half his life abroad and came back to Singapore shortly before\r\nthe elections now complaining we are having too many foreign workers.\r\nBut be that as it may, I do agree that there is an issue with us\r\nhaving too many foreign workers and we are doing our best to keep\r\nit down. The flip side of that is this \u2013 this is a claim that many\r\nother Members of this House have struggled with \u2013 when we tighten\r\nforeign worker numbers, there is a trade-off. It is not trade-off\r\nfree. The people who suffer at the moment are the SMEs. Many different\r\npeople in this House have raised the plight faced by SMEs. So, if\r\nMr Chen has any suggestions on how we can reduce our dependency\r\non foreign workers\r\nwithout hurting the SMEs too much, then I am all ears because we\r\ndid not hear how these trade-offs would work. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bc6f89ed-bfb8-4df1-998f-8059478328f7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-bc6f89ed-bfb8-4df1-998f-8059478328f7\"><!--a--></a>To be fair to him, he\r\ndid mention something. He did mention that we should have a Government\r\nagency looking into different ways of categorising the sectors and,\r\nquite interestingly, he said that we should not set up another agency\r\nor more bureaucracy to deal with this. What he said is that the\r\nGovernment should consult industry more. Again, if we think about\r\nit, how does the Government consult? The Government can consult\r\nin two ways. One, it can employ more people to consult which, by\r\nthe way, means additional costs. Or, two, it can add to the workload\r\nof existing civil servants, which basically means they work a lot\r\nharder for the same pay, if you do not want to pay them more. So,\r\neither way, you are putting additional strain in demanding this\r\nconsultation. Having said that, from what I understand, a lot of\r\nconsultation already takes place in the Government with industry\r\nleaders. As a Member of Parliament, I can also tell you that certainly\r\nin the Trade and Industry Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC),\r\nled by Ms Jessica Tan, we also consult industry leaders and SMEs\r\nto find out what are their demands for labour, and so on. Not just\r\nthe Government, but the Members themselves also consult. There is\r\na lot of consultation that takes place already. When Mr Chen said that\r\nmore consultation is needed, \"Let's do more\", I would like to know\r\nwhat exactly are the nuts and bolts of this \"more\" and how it would\r\npay for itself.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1493</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-781c7477-a9ae-4764-b562-b210b9df4866\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-781c7477-a9ae-4764-b562-b210b9df4866\"><!--a--></a>As I said, in principle,\r\nI agree entirely that if we have investments that pay for themselves\r\nand can achieve the benefits he has promised, it should be done\r\nand all Members of this House will stand behind it.

I would just like to highlight a couple of points,\r\nand these came up mostly in Mr Giam's speech earlier. When Mr Giam\r\nwas asked by various Members of this House the basis of various propositions\r\nhe was making \u2013 by Mr Ang Hin Kee and Dr Janil Puthucheary \u2013 he\r\ndid not give a straight answer on exactly what his source was for\r\nthe various representations. In Dr Janil's case, I think he made\r\nan allusion to a report by the MFA on income inequality between\r\ngenerations. Is that right? I guess we can address that later. But\r\nfrom what I understand, from the executive summary of this report,\r\nthe report actually finds that based on the current cohort that\r\nis being studied, income mobility in Singapore is moderately high\r\nand higher than the US. It also says that it makes no finding in\r\nrelation to future generations, precisely because the future generations\r\nhave not yet matured. So, it does not have the data to make that\r\nfinding. But, based on existing facts, income mobility inter-generational\r\nis actually moderately high. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d34ff11a-020a-474e-99c7-32cb79fca8ec\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d34ff11a-020a-474e-99c7-32cb79fca8ec\"><!--a--></a>The second point I will\r\nmake is that I think Mr Giam also mentioned that we should have\r\nscholarships to get bright people to the SMEs. Again, this is something\r\nthat is good but it is something that is already being done. In\r\nfact, SPRING Singapore has scholarships specifically for the SME\r\nsector. So, once again, before you shout, \"Let's do more\", it is\r\nimportant to know what is being done and then explain what more\r\nyou want to do and, more importantly, how you would finance it if\r\nyou agree that a balanced budget is a good thing. By and large,\r\nI think the points I have highlighted today are largely points to\r\nemphasise that I agree with my friends on both sides of the House\r\nthat there is more we can do. But if we believe a balanced budget\r\nis important, then I think my\r\nfriends are also obliged to explain the trade-offs involved before\r\nwe go into this \"Let's do more\" and how exactly it will be financed.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-489cea0f-cd7b-4100-9d94-1760f44411ba\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-489cea0f-cd7b-4100-9d94-1760f44411ba\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c4386f9b-cdc7-4d0e-834f-803f349f69aa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c4386f9b-cdc7-4d0e-834f-803f349f69aa\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chen, do\r\nyou want to say something?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-28d93e0c-63bc-4c33-81da-374ab04bb0c1\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-28d93e0c-63bc-4c33-81da-374ab04bb0c1\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1494</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0332dcb5-266d-41e8-ac00-98f40a024d55\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-0332dcb5-266d-41e8-ac00-98f40a024d55\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Chen Show Mao (Aljunied)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nSir, I would like to thank the Member for such a close reading of\r\nmy speech.

I note the Finance Minister's concern about the older\r\ngeneration of Singaporeans who have very limited cash savings and\r\nlow CPF balances because wages were much lower 20-30 years ago,\r\nand because of the lower Minimum Sum then. I would, however, caution\r\nthat low CPF balances ought to remain a permanent concern of the\r\nGovernment as future wage increases look likely to be moderated\r\nby inflation and the cost of living.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3cac0551-c869-4119-8e36-ba0b6f15f899\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3cac0551-c869-4119-8e36-ba0b6f15f899\"><!--a--></a>More importantly, the\r\nhigh cost of public housing relative to wage growth is likely to result\r\nin mortgages that are marked by a longer pay-back period, inevitably compromising\r\nthe ability of Singaporeans to grow their nest-egg.

While\r\nI empathise with SMEs who already face short- and medium-term difficulties\r\nwith regard to labour-related overheads, the national interest dictates\r\nthat the post-retirement well-being of all Singaporeans, including\r\nthose very employees that keep SMEs competitive, must remain a primary\r\nsocial objective of any Singapore government.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c69cd0d3-0973-4a59-a72e-737b3c7f0007\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c69cd0d3-0973-4a59-a72e-737b3c7f0007\"><!--a--></a>I am encouraged by the\r\nSilver Housing Bonus of $20,000 which will be extended to older\r\nSingaporeans who wish to sell their existing flats and downgrade\r\nto other flats.

Equally, it is also noteworthy that the Government\r\nhas sought to make the Lease Buyback Scheme more attractive by doubling\r\nthe incentive from $10,000 to $20,000.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-90286994-6677-41f3-adc5-3e7afcf05d81\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-90286994-6677-41f3-adc5-3e7afcf05d81\"><!--a--></a>I see the enactment of policies that allow\r\nolder Singaporeans to monetise their flats as a central pillar in\r\nensuring Singaporeans live out their retirement years with reasonable\r\ndignity, as they stand to receive a larger CPF LIFE payout.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-961812db-e4bb-4945-ab75-47599d772851\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-961812db-e4bb-4945-ab75-47599d772851\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e1e1f1f7-22c8-4b33-bf02-cffbb560d063\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e1e1f1f7-22c8-4b33-bf02-cffbb560d063\"><!--a--></a>Like many Singaporeans,\r\nI am disturbed when I see older Singaporeans having no choice but\r\nto work because they cannot afford to retire.

While I admire the\r\ndrive, determination and self-respect of such Singaporeans, I feel\r\nthe Government need to introduce more policies that ensure as many\r\nof our elderly live out their retirement with a sense of accomplishment,\r\nwith full-time post-retirement employment \u2013 a choice and not a necessity.\r\nFor that reason, I think the Government has done well with the Silver\r\nHousing Bonus and the Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1495</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-30d559bd-c4ae-450b-9170-c78960405625\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-30d559bd-c4ae-450b-9170-c78960405625\"><!--a--></a>However, I am not certain\r\nhow these two schemes will work out in practice.

In fact, according to HDB statistics, it stands at 2% of all\r\ntotal eligible households, or 446 households. Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\nGovernment may want to keep an extra close watch on both the Silver\r\nHousing Bonus and the Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme and consider\r\npublicising a yearly report card on the take-up rate of both initiatives.\r\nThe public character of such a report card, apart from signalling\r\na robust attitude to accountability, would also reinforce and institutionalise\r\nthe importance of the Government's elderly policy in the public consciousness. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-634d72ca-3056-41bc-84bd-cf42132a11a4\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-634d72ca-3056-41bc-84bd-cf42132a11a4\"><!--a--></a>Greater awareness of the\r\nGovernment's elderly policy is also likely to have positive effects\r\non nation building and our national identity.

If the take-up rate is good, it would simply\r\nreflect positively on the Government's 2012 Budget. I sincerely\r\nhope both the Silver Housing Bonus and the Enhanced Lease Buyback\r\nScheme are closely tracked as their success potentially portends\r\nhow Singaporeans can expect to live in their retirement years, especially\r\nin terms of financial security, in a Singapore that is already one\r\nof the most expensive cities in the world.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6671aa9e-5130-427d-b5bf-07e316b7ccf6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6671aa9e-5130-427d-b5bf-07e316b7ccf6\"><!--a--></a>Moving on to the second\r\nissue, Mr Speaker, I would like to register my concern for the Bus\r\nServices Enhancement Fund, as announced by the Minister. No one\r\nI have met since the Minister's Budget Speech really disputes the\r\nbenefits of additional buses on the road, particularly if, in the\r\nMinister's words, it will serve to reduce crowding and waiting time.\r\nBut there, nevertheless, remain some very serious questions about\r\nthis $1.1 billion \"one-time\" commitment to help fund the purchase\r\nof 550 buses.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2404a040-5709-4ece-bfca-3d72514f4278\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2404a040-5709-4ece-bfca-3d72514f4278\"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, many Singaporeans\r\nare asking why the shareholders of our publicly listed bus operators\r\nare being extended this unusual generosity by the Government. According\r\nto both their 2010 Annual Reports \u2013 both of which are available\r\nonline \u2013 SBS Transit has a market share of 75% and around 3,000\r\nbuses on the road, while SMRT has slightly less than 1,000 buses.\r\nIn the case of SBS Transit, the top five shareholders of the company\r\nhold 83% of all shares of that company. The largest shareholder\r\nof SBS Transit is ComfortDelgro which owns 75.11% of the company,\r\nwhile the four next largest shareholders\r\nof SBS Transit are BNP Paribas Securities Singapore, DBS Nominees Private\r\nLimited, United Overseas Bank Nominees Private Limited and Citibank Nominees\r\nSingapore Private Limited.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9cf82534-2b60-412b-ad11-7db6baf4fe3f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9cf82534-2b60-412b-ad11-7db6baf4fe3f\"><!--a--></a>The public unhappiness\r\nover the Bus Services Enhancement Fund since Minister Tharman's\r\nspeech has been very apparent. Part of the reason for this, I hazard,\r\nis because this Government has traditionally been quick to urge\r\nSingaporeans to choose the path of self-sufficiency, reminding ordinary\r\nSingaporeans that there are no free lunches and no one owes us a\r\nliving. It would be useful for this House to remember that both\r\nSBS Transit and SMRT pay their top management market-rate salaries,\r\npay their shareholders regular dividends, while operating in near-monopolistic\r\nconditions. By any stretch of the imagination, these are not broken-back\r\ncompanies.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1496</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3cdcc05c-bf48-4c4d-a161-3ad2a79c4864\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3cdcc05c-bf48-4c4d-a161-3ad2a79c4864\"><!--a--></a>In particular, the SBS\r\nTransit 2010 Annual Report also stated the company's intention to\r\npurchase new buses in addition to funding additional capital expenditure.\r\nFor that purpose, it launched a note programme in May 2010, issuing\r\na $100 million fixed rate note, which is due in 2015. So not only\r\nis the company not a broken-back entity, it clearly knows how to\r\nraise money too. And in FY 2010, SBS Transit paid it shareholders dividends\r\namounting to $27 million, while SMRT paid out $102 million to its shareholders.\r\nSMRT, as I mentioned earlier, 75% of its operations comes from rail operations\r\nso that dividend figure probably needs to be put in perspective.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-aaaa2405-2145-4d77-b39d-cb93a38e0593\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-aaaa2405-2145-4d77-b39d-cb93a38e0593\"><!--a--></a>Unsurprisingly, discerning\r\nand sensible Singaporeans have been quick to eschew the Government's\r\n$1.1 billion windfall for SBS Transit and SMRT Corporation. While\r\nI appreciate the Government's intentions to put buses on the road\r\nquickly, I would urge it to claw back the $1.1 billion of taxpayer\r\nmoney expended on these bus operators over a fixed period of time,\r\nbut after consultation with SBS Transit and SMRT. There ought to be\r\nnothing unusual about clawing back taxpayer money as the Government\r\nalready extends many direct and indirect financial subsidies to\r\nboth these profit-generating private operators. For example, they\r\nare exempted from bidding for Certificates of Entitlement and they\r\nare also exempted from the Additional Registration Fee, the main vehicle\r\ntax and the duty on diesel. In addition, both these operators are\r\nallowed to keep their buses on the road for 20 years, twice as long\r\nas almost all other vehicles.

As Members\r\nwould know, the COE for goods vehicles and buses are classified\r\nunder Category C COEs. While our two profit earning operators do\r\nnot pay a cent for their COEs, this small time businessman will\r\npay in excess of $50,000 for his COE based on today's market rate.\r\nWhile this is not an apple for apple comparison, I would say, it\r\ndoes say something about the perception the man on the street has\r\nabout this Government's apparent lack of desire to communicate why our\r\nbus operators are being extended this $1.1 billion gift.

Our economy is growing\r\nhealthily, we have full employment and our standard of living is\r\nconstantly improving. To achieve all this is not easy and it is\r\nworth cherishing. However, we do not live in a perfect world, of\r\ncourse, and there will be imperfections in Singapore.

If we allow the number of workers to increase\r\n3% annually, 10 years later, these 3 million workers will increase\r\nto 4 million. Foreign workers may make up 40% of the workforce.\r\nIf we continue this way, we will face even more and bigger challenges.\r\nFor example, the pace of economic restructuring in Singapore will\r\nslow down, so will the pace of productivity growth. If we allow\r\nthis situation to continue, will the Singapore economy still be\r\nable to move upwards in the next 10 to 20 years? Our country will\r\nbe more and more crowded.

I believe if we want to\r\nprevent the Singapore economy and society from getting into a difficult\r\nsituation, we must constantly look for new ways of thinking and\r\nmake new inroads. Hence, the Labour Movement understands and supports\r\nthe 2012 Budget and policy directions announced by the Finance Minister.\r\nThe question is whether we can translate these ideas into action. If we are\r\nunable to quicken the pace of economic restructuring and there is\r\nno continuity; if we lose our economic competitiveness, we may lose\r\nour existing investment projects and cannot attract more and better\r\ninvestment projects, what problems will the Singapore economy face?\r\nIf Singapore companies, especially SMEs, cannot adjust to the process\r\nof economic transformation, how will they survive?</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1502</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ad59afe9-bf5b-46e2-b513-59daaf781717\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ad59afe9-bf5b-46e2-b513-59daaf781717\"><!--a--></a> If Singapore workers,\r\nespecially older workers and low-skilled workers, cannot improve\r\nthe level of their skills and their productivity, will they still\r\nhave a place in the future Singapore economy? In other words, what\r\nI am most concerned about is, if our plan to transform the economy\r\nis not successful, in this world where one is racing against the\r\ntide, our economy will go into decline. Worse, our unemployment\r\nrate will go up and our real wages will continue to decrease. In\r\nother words, I am very sure that if we do not change, we will end\r\nup poorer for it. That is why I support this year's Budget. However,\r\nit is not certain that if one makes changes, one will definitely\r\nfind a way out. We cannot assume that if we have this new policy,\r\nwhich is also a good policy, the transformation of the Singapore\r\neconomy will happen naturally.

There is no guarantee that we will succeed\r\nbecause there are many countries out there, many economies out there\r\ntaking the same path. But many of them either did not succeed or\r\nsucceeded to a different extent. In the case of Singapore, speaking\r\nfor the Labour Movement, we embrace this policy because we believe\r\nthis is good for the future of the Singapore economy but, more importantly,\r\nthis is good for the Singapore workers of today and tomorrow.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4a1c664c-2217-4335-86e7-58a9b60fdabc\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4a1c664c-2217-4335-86e7-58a9b60fdabc\"><!--a--></a>We believe that as we\r\nrestructure the Singapore economy towards one that is driven by\r\nproductivity and innovation, we ought to make sure that three important\r\noutcomes are achieved. Firstly, the restructuring must include enterprises\r\nof all sizes \u2013 small, medium, large. The strength of the Singapore\r\neconomy is not in any particular enterprise, not in any particular\r\ncluster, but in many enterprises and in many clusters. The reason\r\nwhy we have full employment today is because we have many companies\r\n\u2013 small, medium, large and in many clusters \u2013 doing well. Therefore\r\nit is very important, very important that with a restructured economy,\r\nwe pay attention to enterprises of all sizes.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-af4705d7-6d7c-41ff-baa8-0f14765d2514\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-af4705d7-6d7c-41ff-baa8-0f14765d2514\"><!--a--></a>The SMEs deserve special\r\nattention because they are the largest employer group. At the same\r\ntime, the strength of any cluster in Singapore is defined by the\r\nweakest link. And the SMEs form a very important link of the Singapore\r\neconomic clusters. In that respect, the Labour Movement is glad\r\nthat the Government is extending special support to the SMEs. Take,\r\nfor example, in the area of manpower development. The Government agencies\r\nhave always extended special support to the SMEs in terms of training\r\ngrants. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-016b14a0-92ba-486c-916c-f38c32c1fd74\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-016b14a0-92ba-486c-916c-f38c32c1fd74\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fcf347e2-31d9-40a9-97e8-577d8e46480d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-fcf347e2-31d9-40a9-97e8-577d8e46480d\"><!--a--></a>Just a few days ago, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister Tharman announced that the training grants for SMEs\r\nwill go up further. Earlier, Member Mr Gerald Giam suggested that\r\nwe ought to introduce scholarship to support the SMEs. I am happy\r\nto share with Mr Giam that actually the scholarship for SME is already\r\nin place. SPRING Singapore administers a scholarship whereby 70%\r\nof the scholarship is funded by the Government, and the SMEs need\r\nto fund only 30%. Many industrial associations are also encouraged\r\nto set up their scholarship scheme with the funding support of 70:30\r\nby the Government. Furthermore,\r\nSPRING Singapore managed a scheme, known as Management Associate, to\r\nhelp the SMEs to recruit fresh graduates to join them. For 18 months,\r\nfor these fresh graduates with employment with the SMEs, SPRING\r\nSingapore provides training and development grants to send them\r\nfor training, not just locally but overseas as well. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1503</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3397a746-89f4-4d0f-81e8-59974fb8e30b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3397a746-89f4-4d0f-81e8-59974fb8e30b\"><!--a--></a>I am also very happy to\r\nsay that the Government is supporting innovation in the SMEs because\r\nthe SMEs cannot compete just on low cost but with better product\r\nand services. So, innovation is very important. In that regard,\r\nagain, we are very happy that Deputy Prime Minister Tharman announced\r\nthe increase of the Innovation Grant from 50% to 70% this year.\r\nI am told that SPRING Singapore also gives Innovation Vouchers of\r\n$5,000. And all the SMEs need to do is to submit a two-page online\r\napplication, and thousands of them are today recipients of this\r\nInnovation Grant. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ce4e86c3-6633-4740-922e-c2af96d119e3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ce4e86c3-6633-4740-922e-c2af96d119e3\"><!--a--></a>We are even happier that\r\nthe Government agencies are doing more to help the SMEs to build\r\nup their business capabilities, for example, from service innovation\r\nthrough customer-centric initiatives (CCI) to branding, to intellectual\r\nproperty management, and so on. On the whole, we believe that a\r\nlot is being done to support the SMEs and, of course, we hope that\r\nmore can be done, and we believe more need to be done. So, for the\r\nSMEs out there, yes, we know that life is tough for them, especially\r\nthe pace of rapid restructuring. However, we want to assure them\r\n\u2013 I think it is important for the tripartite partners to assure\r\nthem \u2013 that we will not neglect them. In fact, in this economic restructuring,\r\nwe, as a tripartite partner from the Labour Movement to the Government, to\r\nthe industrial associations, are going to go the extra mile to support\r\nthem and to reach out to them. Why? Because their interest is also\r\nthe interest of the Labour Movement, as they are the largest employer\r\ngroup in Singapore.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-acf7cf68-420b-4d4b-8caf-58848b4c0497\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-acf7cf68-420b-4d4b-8caf-58848b4c0497\"><!--a--></a>If you look at countries\r\nby size \u2013 small countries, medium-sized countries, large countries\r\nor SML countries \u2013 Singapore is not even a small medium-sized nation.\r\nWe are one of the smallest, a tiny nation; yet, because we are able\r\nto adapt, we turn our small size into our advantage and we respond\r\nquickly. As a result, the Singapore economy is today one of the\r\nmost dynamic and most competitive. I think the same can be said\r\nof the SMEs \u2013 turn your small size into your advantage and adapt\r\nto situations. In fact, many of them, we believe, can ride this\r\nwave of economic restructuring as well. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9d9290df-5e5c-4ff1-bed9-977ff0a2f5db\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9d9290df-5e5c-4ff1-bed9-977ff0a2f5db\"><!--a--></a>Sir, the second important\r\noutcome for the Labour Movement is to ensure that this economic\r\nrestructuring will include workers of all ages at all skill levels.\r\nSome of the older workers and the low-skilled workers, as reflected\r\nby some of the labour Members, are concerned whether they will be\r\nleft out in this particular restructuring exercise. It is important\r\nfor us to recognise that, in fact, the tripartite partners \u2013 the\r\nLabour Movement, the Government and the employer \u2013 have never neglected\r\nthe low-wage workers and the older workers. If you were to look\r\nat recent years, the Government introduced the Workfare Income Supplement\r\n\u2013 not a low-budget programme \u2013 started from $400 million, and went\r\nup to $440 million. I think it will be probably much higher than\r\nthat this year.

In\r\nthis regard, as a Labour Movement, we hope that we make this focus\r\non low-wage workers, older workers, a national effort. Every one\r\nof us can play our part to help the low-wage workers. When I was\r\nthe Environment Minister, I visited our hawker centres. I noted\r\nthat our hawker centre cleaners not only received low wages. In\r\nfact, they did not even have proper uniforms, proper working shoes\r\nand proper cleaning equipment. So, we changed all that. We redesigned\r\ntheir uniforms, we redesigned their jobs, retrained them to upgrade\r\ntheir skills, and today we are going to take a further step to upgrade them. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6ced3474-f4b5-464b-9a4f-674b4f68e08e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6ced3474-f4b5-464b-9a4f-674b4f68e08e\"><!--a--></a>Another example is despatch\r\nriders. At the Meet-the-People Session one night, one despatch rider\r\nin Bedok, a resident, came to see me. He received a fine for illegal\r\nparking. I asked him, \"What caused you to park your motorbike illegally?\"\r\nHe said, \"Mr Lim, I am a despatch rider. My job is to run from building\r\nto building to do despatches. I do not have much time. Many of these\r\nbuildings do not allow us to go into their car parks. So, I have\r\nno choice but to park by the roadside in front of the building or\r\nnext to the building. And many of these buildings are in CBD, so\r\nthey have these double yellow lines, and that is the reason why\r\nI received a fine on that day.\" And I asked, \"Is your company going\r\nto pay for you?\" He said, \"No, all $70 must come from my pocket.\"\r\nSo, of course, I appealed for him. But that got me thinking: why\r\nis it that nobody paid attention to the interests of the despatch\r\nriders? I came back to NTUC located in SLF building, and asked my\r\nbuilding management, \"Every day we have despatch riders coming to\r\nour building. Do we have parking lots for them?\" They said, \"No,\r\nwe don't have, because nobody has anyway.\" I said, \"Then make sure\r\nthat One Marina Boulevard building will be the first one in Shenton\r\nWay to have parking lots for the despatch riders.\" And we implemented\r\nthe programme a few months ago. My point here is this: yes, we can\r\ntalk about low-wage workers, the plight of low-wage workers, the\r\nplight of matured workers but, at the end of the day, talk is not\r\ngood enough, we need action.

In other words, in the recruitment\r\nand hiring of foreign workers, we hope that all employers will, likewise,\r\npay closer attention to their skills and capabilities, and train\r\ntheir workers \u2013 whether they are local workers or foreign workers\r\n\u2013 so that everyone can be productive and add to the strength of\r\nthe Singapore economy.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-49c2d647-c66d-46ff-b1f9-ff00557843a6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-49c2d647-c66d-46ff-b1f9-ff00557843a6\"><!--a--></a>Sir, in conclusion, will\r\nwe succeed?

One day, a\r\nmouse saw the farmer and his wife come home with a mousetrap. Worried,\r\nhe retreated to the farmyard and shouted, \"There is a mousetrap\r\nin the house!\" The chicken clucked and said, \"Mr Mouse, I can tell\r\nthis is a grave concern to you, but I cannot be bothered by it.\"\r\nThe pig sympathised with him and said, \"I am so very sorry, Mr Mouse,\r\nbut there is nothing I can do about it but pray.\" The cow said \"Wow,\r\nMr Mouse. I am sorry for you, but it is nothing to do with me.\"\r\nSo, the mouse returned to the house dejected, to face the farmer's\r\nmousetrap alone. That very night the mousetrap snapped shut. The\r\nfarmer's wife rushed to see what was caught but was bitten by a\r\npoisonous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The farmer rushed\r\nher to the hospital and she returned home with a fever. Everyone\r\nknows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup. But his wife's\r\nsickness continued, so friends and neighbours came to keep vigil.\r\nTo feed them, the farmer roasted the pig. The farmer's wife, unfortunately,\r\ndid not get well and she passed away. So, many people came for her funeral\r\nand the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide enough meat for\r\nall of them. The mouse looked upon all of these from his crack in\r\nthe wall with great sadness. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcResume\" id=\"id-0b3ed88e-e4cb-4559-b23e-5560ab4b2d71\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-0b3ed88e-e4cb-4559-b23e-5560ab4b2d71\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcInTheChair\" id=\"id-e6a4078c-3d31-437d-a32d-df77153c7fda\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-e6a4078c-3d31-437d-a32d-df77153c7fda\"><!--a--></a>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr\r\nSeah Kian Peng) in the Chair]</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-f7fe7962-0275-4a2c-802d-e1d252eca25f\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-f7fe7962-0275-4a2c-802d-e1d252eca25f\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b7eaf1b9-bca4-41d7-9736-c0854798c61e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b7eaf1b9-bca4-41d7-9736-c0854798c61e\"><!--a--></a>What the story tells us\r\nis that there is no problem too small or insignificant that it does not\r\naffect all of us eventually.

It is also one that takes a long-term\r\nview. Having enjoyed considerable economic growth over several decades,\r\nI believe we have the capital and the responsibility to make strategic\r\nlong-term social investments now. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-57c19453-3426-4735-8fb6-9aee593c6dbf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-57c19453-3426-4735-8fb6-9aee593c6dbf\"><!--a--></a>At the same time, I also\r\nsaw this Budget as building and reinforcing an integral aspect of\r\nSingapore \u2013 the quality of resilience \u2013 resilience economically,\r\nsocially and individually. Let me explain.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b6c97b37-41c4-44d8-9232-58a33fdfb19e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b6c97b37-41c4-44d8-9232-58a33fdfb19e\"><!--a--></a>First, on Economic Resilience.\r\nThe need for economic resilience is clear. We are facing unfavourable\r\nglobal conditions. The developed economies are not doing as well as\r\nbefore, and Singapore faces stiffer competition from emerging economies,\r\nespecially in Asia, snapping at our heels. In the face of these\r\nchallenges, the Finance Minister has rightly pushed us to focus\r\non: (1) developing our human capital; (2) driving innovation and\r\nincreasing productivity; and (3) encouraging companies to tap on\r\nlatent workforces in Singapore. Only so can our economy continue\r\nto do well, and Singaporeans can look forward to good jobs and opportunities\r\nin advancement.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7a04fc3b-ad9c-42c5-b660-98b21c05ef3c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7a04fc3b-ad9c-42c5-b660-98b21c05ef3c\"><!--a--></a>But we must not underestimate\r\nthe pains and the costs of pushing our businesses through this transformation.\r\nThe bigger firms are probably better equipped to change than the\r\nSMEs, and SMEs will certainly face a tough time. Many Members in\r\nthis House have talked about the problems faced by SMEs. Some of\r\nmy grassroots leaders and residents who run SMEs also tell me about\r\nhow worried they are about cutting back on foreign manpower. Some\r\nhave also made useful suggestions which I would like to share with\r\nthe House today. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-19471686-6920-433b-b8ae-5aa16c383643\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-19471686-6920-433b-b8ae-5aa16c383643\"><!--a--></a>For example, one resident\r\nsuggested that local businesses which meet the quota be given assurance\r\nthat they will get to keep foreign workers whom they have painstakingly trained\r\nand who have gained so much experience within their firms. It is\r\nalready painful enough for businesses to have to adapt their operations\r\nand for some to downsize their businesses. I think we can make it\r\nless painful by preserving the skills and experiences already built\r\nwithin these firms. Another suggestion to help make the transition\r\na smoother one is to give more flexibility to firms in sub-sectors\r\nthat are highly unpopular with locals, or that require specialised\r\nskills that Singaporeans do not yet have, or where labour requirements\r\nsimply cannot be reduced by improved productivity. I hope the Finance\r\nMinister will consider these suggestions favourably.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-53d6088b-6860-422d-80b9-c418c25a5c93\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-53d6088b-6860-422d-80b9-c418c25a5c93\"><!--a--></a>Let me now next turn to\r\nSocial Resilience. Social resilience comes from Singaporeans having\r\na shared destiny. We cannot have social resilience if our society\r\nis split between the \"haves\" and \"have-nots\". Instead, we must build\r\nwithin our people a deep sense of community, a deep sense of participation,\r\nownership and sharing. This means that we need to give a leg up\r\nto those who are disadvantaged and help them to achieve their full\r\npotential. I am therefore glad that the Minister for Finance has\r\nchosen to focus help on the elderly, low-income families and those\r\nwith disabilities. In particular, I applaud the bold moves to introduce\r\nthe Special Employment Credit (SEC), expand and enhance the affordability\r\nof the Intermediate and Long Term Care healthcare and to make the\r\nGST Vouchers a permanent feature. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-30d2e08e-7026-4fcb-b066-0cbc35c8e864\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-30d2e08e-7026-4fcb-b066-0cbc35c8e864\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1510</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4911e96d-5d52-4eab-b4c0-808b3986d86c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4911e96d-5d52-4eab-b4c0-808b3986d86c\"><!--a--></a>During the debate on the President's Address,\r\nI had spoken at length in this House about the need to do more for\r\nthe elderly who had done so much in building our nation and I am\r\nmost glad that the Government has come up with an extensive package\r\nof measures to help this group. But the Government cannot act alone;\r\nthe private and people sectors need to play a part too. For example,\r\nI hope that the businesses will take advantage of the SEC to hire\r\nmore older workers. Employers should not take it that because of\r\nthe restraints on foreign manpower that they are left with \"no choice\"\r\nbut to hire older workers. Instead, I hope they will invest in their\r\nolder workers, and if need be, tap on Government's schemes such\r\nas Advantage Fund to redesign jobs for them, and hence enable them\r\nto become valuable resources in their companies. This will also enable\r\nolder workers to improve their lives, and continue to make meaningful contributions\r\nto Singapore.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-95d7b825-5432-46f4-b06c-cfaeb1204d51\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-95d7b825-5432-46f4-b06c-cfaeb1204d51\"><!--a--></a>While I understand that\r\nit is not possible to cater to everything and everyone in one single\r\nBudget, I hope the Finance Minister will not forget other groups\r\nwho are equally deserving of our attention. In particular, I would\r\nlike to speak for Singaporeans requiring mental healthcare. They\r\nare neither disabled nor elderly, but they too face particular challenges.\r\nFor example, in school or at work, their tension and energies are\r\noften sapped by their constant battle with their emotional and mental\r\nstruggles. At home, family members may not fully understand or know\r\nhow to live with them. For those with more serious conditions such\r\nas psychosis, they will face great difficulty eventually when their\r\ncaregivers, often their parents, pass away or become unable to care\r\nfor them any further.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c1437992-51cc-42e1-966c-da1c7ddfc9cf\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c1437992-51cc-42e1-966c-da1c7ddfc9cf\"><!--a--></a>The World Health Organization\r\nestimates that, globally, one in four people will suffer from mental\r\nillness at some point in their life. This is a significant statistic\r\nand the story in Singapore is not that different. Yet, despite the\r\nprevalence of mental illness around the world, this category of\r\nillness continues to be plagued by stigma that discourages social\r\nacceptance and prevents those who need help from stepping forth\r\nto seek the treatment that they need. Therefore, I hope more can\r\nbe done to: (1) de-stigmatise mental illness further; (2) promote\r\ngreater social acceptance; (3) enhance accessibility and affordability\r\nto professional mental healthcare; and (4) strengthen the community care\r\nand support framework. With timely and proper interventions, mental\r\nillness can be managed effectively and those with mental conditions\r\ncan be employable, take care of themselves, rely on themselves and\r\nenjoy a better quality of life. In essence, a truly inclusive society\r\nhas no place for stigma and so we must also combat stigma and help and\r\ncare for everyone.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-43e05687-04f5-4fcf-91c1-5aab99ca26fb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-43e05687-04f5-4fcf-91c1-5aab99ca26fb\"><!--a--></a>Finally, let me also touch\r\non individual resilience. While I support sharing more with Singaporeans\r\nin the Budget, the Budget should not be simply about giving <em class=\"ph i\">hong\r\nbaos</em>. We know that the Government does not create free money\r\nto give out; the revenues in the Budget has to come from somewhere\r\nand ultimately will come from our people through taxes. So, yes,\r\nwe should share the progress of the nation with all Singaporeans,\r\nbut we must also guard against the seeping in of a sense of over-dependency\r\nand entitlement. We are not there yet but we should guard against\r\nit.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d3257fba-fd9b-417f-8840-3911b99fd20c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d3257fba-fd9b-417f-8840-3911b99fd20c\"><!--a--></a>Singapore has been able\r\nto grow and progress to where we are today because of the capabilities\r\nand efforts of our people. Our forefathers possessed enormous resilience; they\r\ntoiled and saved, and built up our nation, so that we are able to\r\nincrease our social spending and help more groups of Singaporeans,\r\nbut let us never lose this resilience and tenacity of our forefathers.\r\nApart from upgrading ourselves continuously, it is important that\r\nwe remain grounded in core values, retain a strong sense of personal responsibility and\r\nself confidence, and make sure that we do not cultivate a sense\r\nof self-handicap and learned helplessness. Otherwise, very soon,\r\nwe will lose our edge and drive, and end up living off our inheritance.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1511</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-710144da-1f23-4ff4-8a05-a576d8029622\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-710144da-1f23-4ff4-8a05-a576d8029622\"><!--a--></a>This is also why I am\r\nglad that this year's Budget will include an injection of funds into\r\nthe Edusave Endowment Fund.

I hope that more of these resources will also\r\nbe used to emphasise character building from young, on top of equipping\r\nour students with textbook skills and knowledge.

What is sufficiently appreciated about this\r\nBudget is that it is actually a10-year plan. It is a continuation\r\nof the Budget of the previous year, which was that we anticipate\r\nthat in the next 10 years, cost of living is going to rise. Now,\r\nif your wages remain the same and your cost of living rises, then\r\nyou have a gap and Singaporeans are going to be disadvantaged. The\r\nstrategy that has been worked into this Budget \u2013 it started last\r\nyear but it has been continued this year \u2013 is that you get your\r\nwages to go up as well as to follow the costs that are going up\r\nand you keep the differential between wages and costs, so that at\r\nthe end of 10 years, we have 30% growth and we are able to keep\r\nup with rising costs. That kind of strategic vision is not something\r\nwhich you find in many other budgets in other countries in the world\r\nand I thought that that sense of balance \u2013 balancing costs and the\r\nwages \u2013 was something which defined the ethos of this Budget, which\r\nis preparing us for the future.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cdb452b2-8b16-4c22-8550-fd21f8eda332\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-cdb452b2-8b16-4c22-8550-fd21f8eda332\"><!--a--></a>There was another aspect\r\nof the Budget in respect of which I thought it showed neat or fine\r\ncalibration and delicate balance which was achieved and that is\r\nwith respect to foreign workers. There have been many calls in the\r\npast few speeches about, maybe, not reducing the quota of foreign\r\nworkers by this much. In this Budget, there were three features\r\nabout reducing dependence on foreign workers. The first, raising\r\nthe eligibility criteria for Employment Passes or S Passes; second,\r\ncalibrated reductions in the DRCs in manufacturing and services\r\nsectors; third, we may have to consider an increase in the foreign\r\nworker levy beyond July 2013. I listened to the calls for we should\r\nnot reduce the DRCs, we must have more foreign workers and then\r\nI wondered has anybody recalled the cry at the last General Election\r\nwhere people said, \"We have too many foreigners in Singapore. Our transport\r\nis overcrowded. Our hawker centres are overcrowded. There are too\r\nmany foreigners here.\"</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1513</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-95e4ebab-7126-4abf-a0cf-6ed74834dd69\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-95e4ebab-7126-4abf-a0cf-6ed74834dd69\"><!--a--></a>Where does it square?\r\nBecause on the one hand we are saying there are too many foreigners\r\nhere, the Government responds and listens and to be fair to the\r\nGovernment, the reason why it is reducing the DRCs is because we\r\nrecognise that we cannot be continually dependent on foreign labour\r\nand you cannot also be forever increasing the numbers but the answer\r\nis to cut down and that is the response. It is also a response to the\r\nsense of Singaporeans that perhaps there are too many foreigners\r\nhere and then the next response is, \"Oh, but we must have more foreigners.\"\r\nThat just illustrates the dilemma that any good government faces,\r\nthat sense of balance \u2013 how do you balance this? And I think the\r\nbalance in this case has been achieved correctly by calibrating\r\nthe reductions in the DRCs but also recognising that once you cut\r\nback on the number of foreign workers, you still got to find another\r\nway to achieve growth and how do you do that. You have to look at\r\nproductivity.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b4f8d84d-3e62-43c6-9777-255b44dccc8c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b4f8d84d-3e62-43c6-9777-255b44dccc8c\"><!--a--></a> I notice that in the\r\nposition taken by the Workers' Party what they had suggested was perhaps\r\nto have different industry clusters for dependency ratio ceilings.\r\nI noted with some interest that they suggested that one cluster\r\nshould perhaps be finance, aerospace, biomedical and professional\r\nservices which I would loosely term as the high-end services and\r\nthey suggested that for those you can cut back on the number of foreign\r\nworkers. Then they suggested another cluster \u2013 social services,\r\npublic healthcare and construction for public infrastructure \u2013 which\r\nI would classify as sort of middle to low-end \u2013 and suggested that\r\nfor those, we may need less stringent foreign manpower policy to\r\nkeep the costs low.

I thought that this sounded reasonable.\r\nThen I asked myself, what does it actually mean because is this\r\nsomething that we are already doing? As I understand it, we have\r\nquotas for the different industries. Those quotas and the standards\r\nhave been arrived at in discussion with people from those industries,\r\nwith input and with said support as well.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 1514</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1b6188fd-086e-4db6-b0bb-9ca705a5d67b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1b6188fd-086e-4db6-b0bb-9ca705a5d67b\"><!--a--></a>The common term that faces the Government\r\nwith respect to setting quotas is this: to what extent or degree\r\nor detail that you delve into it? You can do as the Government is\r\ndoing now, broad quotas for various industries and you let the industries\r\nself-regulate. At the other end of the spectrum, and I am not sure\r\nthis is what Mr Chen was suggesting, perhaps not, but I just want\r\nto examine it. You cannot, as a Government, say \"X company, I give\r\nyou five passes; Y company, I give you 10 passes; and Z company,\r\nI give you 20 passes.\" Because as a Government, you have no idea\r\nhow much they need. What you do is you take your foreign worker\r\nlevy, which is the cost, and then you look at the company, look\r\nat that cost and decide for themselves, depending on their profitability, depending\r\non their productivity, how many foreign workers they feel that they\r\ncan support.

To what extent you calibrate it and you try to micromanage\r\nit, I do not think that you should try to micromanage it too much,\r\nbecause companies must have the flexibility to decide how they want\r\nto run their businesses and they would know what is most efficient\r\nfor them. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-440a8b55-8a60-4a21-9741-0fa9f5f53615\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-440a8b55-8a60-4a21-9741-0fa9f5f53615\"><!--a--></a>This brings me back to\r\nthe productivity point which is that if we are going to cut back the\r\nnumber of people, then something has got to give and you have got\r\nto be more productive.

Tiong Bahru market is an old\r\nmarket and there are steps there. When I did my walkabout, owners\r\nasked me for ramps for the elderly. I thought, \"Okay, great idea.\"\r\nSo I asked NEA, \"Can you put in the ramp?\" NEA said, \"Yes, we would\r\nput in the ramp.\" Then a few months later, I came back, there were the\r\nramps. But they were like alpine ski slope at 45 degrees angle and\r\nthe senior citizens were slipping down. I said, \"Any reason why\r\nthis incline is so steep.\" He said because our land ends there.\r\nI said, \"Why don't you extend it there?\" He said, \"No, that is LTA land.\"\r\nI said, \"Go a bit further.\" He said, \"No, that is NParks land.\"\r\nIt so happened the NParks and LTA officials were next to me. So,\r\nI looked at the NParks guy and said, \"Have you any objection?\" He\r\nsaid, \"No.\" I said to the LTA person, \"Do you have any objection?\" He\r\nsaid, \"No.\" I looked at the NEA guy and said, \"So you extend it\r\na little bit.\" And they did, a few weeks later, and sent us the\r\nramp. So, I had a 30 to 35-degree incline ramp, instead of a 45-degree\r\none.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ed524e21-078a-492d-9a2d-b575ee81d354\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ed524e21-078a-492d-9a2d-b575ee81d354\"><!--a--></a>My point is that it could\r\nhave been avoided with some discussions to begin with, with more\r\ncoordination between the agencies. To be fair, it was done at the\r\nend of the day, but it was not the first instinct. This keeps playing\r\nitself out in various scenarios. My Robertson Quay scenario which\r\nI had spoken about. Let me explain the problem because every time\r\nI raise it, I get a quizzically raised eyebrow. The problem with Robertson\r\nQuay is that you have young people there who cannot afford to go\r\ninto the outlet that sells alcohol. What they do is they buy alcohol\r\nfrom a convenience store nearby\r\nand they sit on the bridges, they sit all around Robertson Quay,\r\nbecause they want to listen to the music from Zuok, but they do\r\nnot want to pay the cover charge. I understand that. They are all\r\nyoung, they do not have the same kind of budget. But the difficulty\r\nafter a while is that when they get high, then it becomes extremely\r\nnoisy. Then you have the shouting, the screaming, you also have\r\nthe puking which is less pleasant, and it just detracts from the\r\nenvironment there. So, one thing I suggested was maybe we could\r\nhave \"no alcohol\" zone. Then everybody looks at me and thinks \"party\r\npooper\". Okay, fine, then maybe let us not go to that extreme, that\r\nis, try conventional measures. I looked at LTA because there are\r\ntwo bridges, and bridges come under LTA. I said, \"Could we not clear\r\nthe place?\" LTA said, \"No, Madam, this comes under the Street Works\r\nAct. Under the Street Works Act, we can only remove objects. People\r\nare not objects. So, we cannot remove them.\" So, I looked at the\r\nPolice, \"Maybe we could do something to move them along.\" \"No, Madam,\r\nbecause they have not committed any offence. They are rightfully\r\nthere.\" I am left with a situation where I have residents and businesses\r\nthere who have this concern.

Even\r\nto pay the administration fee of $92.70, some of them have applied\r\nfor ComCare fund.

Blame only makes us victims. Technology is a tool\r\nand a very useful tool it is, too.

It is said\r\nthat the ultimate state of learning is when you are open to what\r\nyou see, what you touch, and what you hear.

Imagine the value\r\nof this when young people step into the working world.

This is where\r\nself-help groups such as MENDAKI, SINDA, CDAC and EA have played\r\nsignificant roles in helping lower-income Singaporeans attain a\r\ngood education so that they can have more opportunities in the future.\r\nFor instance, MENDAKI'S Max-Out programme has seen various success\r\nstories that we can be proud of. The Max-Out programme is designed\r\nto help youths who drop out of school to get back into mainstream\r\neducation, prepare them for the GCE \"N\" Level examination and proceed\r\nto either obtain work skills certification or continue their education\r\nat the ITE for their NITEC or Higher NITEC. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1b6765e1-814a-43e9-8ddc-65af382ab04e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-1b6765e1-814a-43e9-8ddc-65af382ab04e\"><!--a--></a>Farhan is one example\r\nof our Max-Out student who achieved success that we can be proud\r\nof.
