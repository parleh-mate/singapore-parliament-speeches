If that is the case, then perhaps, before\r\n\r\nI  reply to the Question, may I, by way of background,  trace\r\n\r\nthe history of the National Library issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the possibility of the National Library building\r\n\r\nbeing removed was first made public in 1988 when the URA  was\r\n\r\nformulating  the  Civic District Master  Plan.  URA  held  an\r\n\r\nexhibition  on  the  draft Master  Plan  for  the  Civic  and\r\n\r\nCultural  District which was the area around the  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nPark  area  in  April  1988. This was followed  by  a  public\r\n\r\ndialogue  in May 1988 between the then Minister for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  Mr S. Dhanabalan, and professional  bodies  and\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was general support for the removal of the\r\n\r\nNational Library building to open up the view of Fort Canning\r\n\r\nHill from the Bras Basah area. There was another proposal  to\r\n\r\nrealign  Stamford  Road behind National Museum  so  that  the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum would be better integrated with  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nPark.  This  would also entail the demolition of the  library\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public feedback led to further studies by URA and\r\n\r\nthe former PWD on how to better integrate the land parcels in\r\n\r\nthe  area  to  create a more pedestrian friendly environment.\r\n\r\nSeveral  options were explored, including depressing Stamford\r\n\r\nRoad, providing an alternative at-grade alignment behind  the\r\n\r\nNational  Museum  and a tunnel through the National  Library.\r\n\r\nThe only feasible option\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwas the tunnel option, and this was subsequently incorporated\r\n\r\ninto  the  Master Plan for the Civic District.  The finalised\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan  was completed and exhibited to  the  public  in\r\n\r\nFebruary 1992.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1998, SMU announced that it would build its\r\n\r\ncampus  in the Bras Basah area.  There was a series of  Forum\r\n\r\npage letters in the newspapers and direct suggestions to  URA\r\n\r\nfollowing the announcement.  URA responded to these  letters,\r\n\r\nand explained the plans to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1999, SMU chaired a public symposium on the\r\n\r\nphysical development of its campus.  Issues such as  why  SMU\r\n\r\nwas  located in Bras Basah Park, and the need to  remove  the\r\n\r\nNational   Library  building  were  addressed  by   the   URA\r\n\r\nrepresentative  at  the symposium.  URA  also  explained  the\r\n\r\nissues   to   the  press,  and  the  press  published   these\r\n\r\nexplanations on 20th March.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15th January this year, SMU chaired a technical\r\n\r\nworkshop  to obtain feedback from architectural professionals\r\n\r\non  three  alternative  proposals  put  up  by  SMU's  master\r\n\r\nplanners.   At  the workshop, Mr Tay objected  to  the  plans\r\n\r\nwhich  proposed buildings on Bras Basah Park, and the removal\r\n\r\nof  the National Library building.  He subsequently called  a\r\n\r\npress  conference on 24th January to present his  alternative\r\n\r\nproposal for the SMU campus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA did not participate in Mr Tay's press conference\r\n\r\nbecause it was not invited.  Neither could it respond to  the\r\n\r\nproposal  then as it had not received a formal proposal  from\r\n\r\nMr Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay wrote to the Prime Minister about his proposal on\r\n\r\n31st January 2000.  The Prime Minister then referred it to my\r\n\r\nMinistry for evaluation. Subsequently, I met with Mr  Tay  on\r\n\r\ntwo  occasions to better understand his plan.  On the  second\r\n\r\noccasion,  I  asked  Mr  Tay to present  it  to  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials with URA and LTA present to give their professional\r\n\r\ninputs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry made an assessment of Mr Tay's and URA's\r\n\r\nplans and I replied to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  on  28th February.  I am informed  that  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's Office has replied to Mr Tay.  Sir, I  have\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's permission to release both letters  to\r\n\r\nthe  public.  May I circulate both letters to Members of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  for  their information. [Copies of letters distributed\r\n\r\nto hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I refer Members of the House to my letter to\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister dated 28th February?  In particular, may I\r\n\r\nread part of the letter starting from paragraph 3:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Tay's proposal and URA's guidelines differ over two\r\n\r\nfundamental  issues.  The first issue is the  extent  of  the\r\n\r\nopen  space  in  the Bras Basah area.  The  second  issue  is\r\n\r\nwhether  the  existing National Library  building  should  be\r\n\r\nretained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Tay Kheng Soon's Proposal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay feels that the Bras Basah Park should be kept as\r\n\r\na  large open space with completely open views from the roads\r\n\r\nand  unblocked  by  buildings, in order  to  retain  what  he\r\n\r\nperceives  to  be a crucial element in the mental  map  which\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have of the city.  He thus proposes to create  a\r\n\r\nsunken   park  below  street  level,  reflecting  pool,   and\r\n\r\nwaterfall; and to replace the current foliage with structured\r\n\r\nrows  of  palm trees to give this area a sense of  monumental\r\n\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the sunken park would restrict pedestrian\r\n\r\nmovement between the various buildings at street level as the\r\n\r\npublic would have to walk around the edges of the park to get\r\n\r\nto  buildings on the other side.  Since the MRT tunnels under\r\n\r\nthe  sunken park would limit the usable area, Mr Tay proposes\r\n\r\nto  meet SMU's floor space requirements via clusters of  tall\r\n\r\nbuildings  of  up to 15 storeys at the foot of Fort  Canning.\r\n\r\nThese  tall buildings would not be in keeping with  the  low-rise  character of the Civic District with its many  historic\r\n\r\nbuildings.   It would also block the views to  and  from  the\r\n\r\nFort Canning Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay agrees that the National Library building lacks\r\n\r\narchitectural  merit.  However, he feels  strongly  that  the\r\n\r\nLibrary  should  be preserved for historical and  sentimental\r\n\r\nreasons.  To avoid the Library, he proposes that the new road\r\n\r\ntunnel  run alongside the current Stamford Road for a stretch\r\n\r\nand then dive down under it.  This plan requires a long, deep\r\n\r\ntrench,  flanked  by  one-metre high  parapet  walls,  to  be\r\n\r\ncreated  in front of the National Library up to the  entrance\r\n\r\nof the National Museum.  This will severely mar the landscape\r\n\r\nof  the  area  and restrict pedestrian movement between  Bras\r\n\r\nBasah Park and the National Museum area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nURA's Planning Guidelines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA's plan for this area recognises the importance of\r\n\r\nretaining an open space and the visual connection between the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Arts Museum and the National Museum.  By  allowing\r\n\r\nSMU's buildings and some public facilities to be built on the\r\n\r\npark, the plan seeks to encourage better public usage of  the\r\n\r\npark.   Capping  the  height  of buildings  around  the  Fort\r\n\r\nCanning Hill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narea to around 4 to 5 storeys will maintain the character  of\r\n\r\nthe Civic District and protect the view to and from the hill.\r\n\r\nThe   addition  of  low-rise  institutional  buildings  would\r\n\r\nfurther enhance the civic quality of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The realignment of the existing Stamford Road and the\r\n\r\nbuilding of the tunnel through Fort Canning Hill provides the\r\n\r\nmost  direct route for traffic moving from Marina Centre  and\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Business  District to Orchard  Road,  and  thus\r\n\r\nsiphons traffic away from the Bras Basah area, making it more\r\n\r\npleasant  for  pedestrians.  It will provide  SMU  with  more\r\n\r\nregular  land parcels to work with.  However, this  alignment\r\n\r\nrequires the removal of the National Library building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMND's Assessment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, Mr Tay's and URA's plans seek to achieve\r\n\r\ndifferent  planning  intentions, with very  different  start-points.   We  need to decide between a plan which provides  a\r\n\r\nlarge  unshaded  open  space and retention  of  the  National\r\n\r\nLibrary  building  and one which seeks to bring  more  public\r\n\r\nactivity  into the centre of the area.  With the former,  the\r\n\r\ntrade-off is a poorer road network, a tunnel which  cuts  the\r\n\r\narea  into two and high rise buildings in an essentially low-rise environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND clearly prefers URA's plan as it is more people-friendly, facilitates better pedestrian flow and preserves\r\n\r\nthe ambience and environment of the important Civic District.\r\n\r\nIt  also  allows SMU greater flexibility to plan the area  to\r\n\r\nmeet  their  requirements.  URA's plan  brings  about  better\r\n\r\ncoherence  in  the cluster of buildings for SMU  in  that  it\r\n\r\nfacilitates pedestrian traffic throughout the cluster without\r\n\r\nbeing  subdivided by a Stamford Road which will  carry  heavy\r\n\r\nand fast vehicular traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND acknowledges that some members of the public are in\r\n\r\nfavour  of retaining the National Library building.  However,\r\n\r\nthe Preservation of Monuments Board and the National Heritage\r\n\r\nBoard  have  assessed that there are insufficient  merits  to\r\n\r\npreserve the building.  Nevertheless, PMB will look into  how\r\n\r\nthe  social  memory  of the building of the  library  can  be\r\n\r\ncaptured  and  commemorated.  We will also encourage  SMU  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  in  the  design of its buildings  features  that\r\n\r\nwould help Singaporeans evoke memories of the Library.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that the issue of the\r\n\r\nNational  Library has been extensively discussed and debated,\r\n\r\nboth  publicly and privately, not once, not twice,  but  many\r\n\r\ntimes,  by  way  of public dialogues, symposiums,  workshops,\r\n\r\nletters  to  the press and private consultations since  1988,\r\n\r\nand  now this debate in the House.  So my view is that  there\r\n\r\nis  no question that URA or any other relevant authority  has\r\n\r\nnot seen fit to reply to public suggestions on this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay I begin by thanking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for his full reply and welcoming the  steps  in\r\n\r\nmeeting  the  architect, Mr Tay Kheng Soon.  May  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister:  will  he not consider further public  process  and\r\n\r\nattempt for dialogue with the public in general, in the sense\r\n\r\nthat meeting with an individual architect is not the same  as\r\n\r\nmeeting other people who might feel that the Library  or  the\r\n\r\nPark is worth saving?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in the chronology of events that I\r\n\r\nnarrated just now, it is quite obvious that there have been a\r\n\r\nlot  of  public  dialogues and discussions on  not  only  the\r\n\r\nsubject of the National Library, whether it can and should be\r\n\r\nretained,  but  also  the  general discussion  on  the  whole\r\n\r\nenvironment of the area.  In this particular case, there  was\r\n\r\na   very   specific  alternative  proposal.   This   specific\r\n\r\nalternative proposal entailed a technical alternative, ie, to\r\n\r\nrealign  the  tunnel.   There was  also  a  general  proposal\r\n\r\nregarding  the  ambience  of  the  area  as  it  pertains  to\r\n\r\nretaining  the Park.  I have met  the proponent  of  the  new\r\n\r\nplan,  Mr  Tay Kheng Soon, not once, but twice.  I wanted  to\r\n\r\nunderstand what was the rationale for the proposal and why he\r\n\r\nproposed  it this way. I also wanted, at the second  meeting,\r\n\r\nto  evaluate the technical feasibility of it.  So this  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  specific proposal which has to be dealt with, responded\r\n\r\nto and evaluated in a very specific manner.  There have been,\r\n\r\nas the Member would agree, a lot of dialogues and discussions\r\n\r\non  the  generalities  of the proposal, whether  the  Library\r\n\r\nshould  be  retained, the historical merits of retaining  the\r\n\r\nLibrary  as  opposed to the perceived lack  of  architectural\r\n\r\nmerit and so on and so forth.  I do not think there is a need\r\n\r\nnow  for us to reopen the debate again, especially when there\r\n\r\nis  on  the  table  a very specific alternative  proposal.  I\r\n\r\nthought  it  was proper for us to evaluate and  look  at  the\r\n\r\nalternative proposal seriously, and we have done this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not\r\n\r\nreally good in architectural details.  But what I would  like\r\n\r\nto ask the Minister is:  why is the National Library not kept\r\n\r\nin  view of strong public sentiments and there are a  lot  of\r\n\r\ndebate and views on it?  Is a cost issue involved?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of\r\n\r\nkeeping  or  not  keeping the National Library  was  not  the\r\n\r\nstarting  point of the discussion.  As I recounted just  now,\r\n\r\nwhen  the Masterplan for the area was done in 1988, the whole\r\n\r\nquestion of upgrading and improving the ambience of the  area\r\n\r\nand  turning  it into a civic and cultural district  was  the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  the  exercise.  The removal  of  the  National\r\n\r\nLibrary,  at that time, was felt desirable because  it  would\r\n\r\nopen  up  the vista to the Fort Canning Hill.  That  was  the\r\n\r\nstarting  point  of the process. And at that time,  many  who\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  the  dialogue  session,  from  reading  the\r\n\r\nminutes  of  the discussions and newspaper reports,  did  not\r\n\r\nfeel  very  strongly about the library. In fact, many  agreed\r\n\r\nwith the idea of removing the library in order, as I said, to\r\n\r\ncompletely  open up the whole area to show off  Fort  Canning\r\n\r\nHill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to that, there was also the question of how\r\n\r\nwe could improve the transportation network and this involved\r\n\r\nthe building of a tunnel.  In fact, this idea of a tunnel, of\r\n\r\nan alternative road, came from the public dialogue itself.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve   it  was  a  proposal  from  one  of  the   industry\r\n\r\nparticipants in the dialogue. Studies were made  and  it  was\r\n\r\nfelt that that was the best alignment for the tunnel and that\r\n\r\nalso required the removal of the library.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the library had very strong architectural, historical\r\n\r\nor  sentimental value, and if the Preservation  of  Monuments\r\n\r\nBoard  and the National Heritage Board had so classified  it,\r\n\r\nwe would have had  to look at alternative plans.  But in this\r\n\r\nparticular case, these authorities were consulted and it  was\r\n\r\nthe  general  consensus at that time that there was  no  such\r\n\r\nstrong  merit.   And  indeed, many architects  had  come  out\r\n\r\npublicly  to  say that there is also no architectural  merit.\r\n\r\nSo  there  is  no question of us setting out to demolish  the\r\n\r\nlibrary  but,  in the overall scheme of things,  the  general\r\n\r\nappearance and ambience of the area can obviously  be  better\r\n\r\nenhanced if we are able to remove the library.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do acknowledge that there are many people who feel\r\n\r\nvery  strongly  about  the library  and  I  understand  their\r\n\r\nfeelings why\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  feel this way.  I must admit that I too have very  fond\r\n\r\nmemories  of  the library and the area because I studied  for\r\n\r\nsix  years there. I was in St. Joseph's Institution from 1960\r\n\r\nto 1966 and I remember spending many hours in the library and\r\n\r\nin  the park.  But I also remember that there were many other\r\n\r\nold buildings in the area.  There was the Catholic Centre,  a\r\n\r\nBakers'  Bakery next door, bookshops in the area and  a  bus-stop just outside the cathedral.  It was actually more than a\r\n\r\nbus-stop, as SJI boys and RI boys would testify, because that\r\n\r\nwas  the  meeting place where you went there not to  catch  a\r\n\r\nbus,  but  also  to catch the attention of somebody  special.\r\n\r\nThat  is  what  many  of  us who had  studied  in  that  area\r\n\r\nremember.   The  library is part and parcel of  that  general\r\n\r\nsentiment and ambience of the area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think our memories are more than just of physical\r\n\r\nbuildings. They are also memories of the environment  of  the\r\n\r\narea, the hustle and bustle of that area, the youthful energy\r\n\r\nand  exuberance  of  the area.  Many of those  buildings  are\r\n\r\ngone.   The Catholic Centre is gone, Bakers' Bakery is  gone,\r\n\r\nthe  bus-stop  is gone.  The park, which was the  old  school\r\n\r\nfield,  is now deserted and quiet most of the time. And  yet,\r\n\r\nif  you ask me whether those memories are still there, I say,\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  They are still there.\"  To me, it is not just a matter\r\n\r\nof  keeping  physical buildings.  It is also  trying  to  re-capture the spirit of the area, of the past. And when I  look\r\n\r\nat  the plans for the area, with SMU coming into the area and\r\n\r\nthe  new  campus being located in the area, I feel tremendous\r\n\r\nexcitement  because I think this is going to bring  back  the\r\n\r\nold  spirit of the area.  It is going to bring back life into\r\n\r\nthat  very important part of the city.  It is going  to  make\r\n\r\nthat area once again throb with life and energy.  That to  me\r\n\r\nis  probably  as  important, if not, more so than  the  whole\r\n\r\ndebate  of keeping the park open or the need for us  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe library.  And this is how I would like to see people view\r\n\r\nthis new plan, to look at it in this perspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I met Mr Tay, I asked him why did he feel so\r\n\r\nstrongly  about  retaining the library  building  because  in\r\n\r\n1988, he actually supported the removal of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNational  Library building. He told me he was  involved  with\r\n\r\nthe  National  Museum  at that time and the  National  Museum\r\n\r\nwanted  to  expand and one of the ways to expand  it  was  to\r\n\r\nremove  the National Library.  I think he did not  feel  very\r\n\r\nstrongly about the National Library then.  I asked him,  \"Why\r\n\r\nhave  you changed your mind?\"  He said that he had discovered\r\n\r\nnew historical facts about the library and he referred me  to\r\n\r\none  of the poems which one of the young people sent to  him.\r\n\r\nIt  was  a poem by Edwin Thumboo.  He gave me a copy.  It  is\r\n\r\ncalled  \"The  National Library, Singapore\" written  by  Edwin\r\n\r\nThumboo, and one of the lines in that poem said, \"To preserve\r\n\r\nthe past, ensure the future.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Mr Tay, the library is more than just a library. It\r\n\r\nis  an  icon, a symbol. If you knock it down, you would  have\r\n\r\nknocked away the past.  If you preserve it, you preserve  the\r\n\r\npast  and  therefore you ensure the future. After looking  at\r\n\r\nhis  plans and looking at the whole redevelopment of the area\r\n\r\nwith  SMU coming in, I thought to myself that perhaps another\r\n\r\ninterpretation of what Mr Edwin Thumboo wrote - \"Preserve the\r\n\r\npast,  ensure  the future\" -  would be to actually  redevelop\r\n\r\nthe  area along the lines that have been proposed.  And  what\r\n\r\nbetter way to preserve the past and ensure the future than to\r\n\r\nbring  life back into the city, to bring back what was  there\r\n\r\nin  the  past,  the atmosphere, the hustle  and  bustle,  the\r\n\r\nthrobbing  energy and vitality, thousands of  young  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  going about their work, going to class, hanging around\r\n\r\nin  the  public  spaces in between classes.  I  thought  that\r\n\r\nreally  is  something which is in keeping with the sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed  because, by doing so, you are not just  preserving\r\n\r\nthe  past,  but  you  do  so  in  a  way  which  provides  an\r\n\r\nopportunity,  an  environment,  an  institution  which   will\r\n\r\nbenefit many generations of Singaporeans to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say to Members of this House and to the\r\n\r\npublic,  please look at the plans when they are  produced  by\r\n\r\nSMU  and the planners that have been commissioned by  SMU  to\r\n\r\nredevelop  the  area, to bring life back into  the  area,  to\r\n\r\nbring back the past and give us a wonderful new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninstitution  which  will  cater  to  future  generations   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think many of us would\r\n\r\nshare  an interest in the Minister's exciting vision  of  the\r\n\r\nstreet life.  May I move to the question about the principles\r\n\r\nof  consultation. The Minister has said that there seem to be\r\n\r\nmore  public sentiments now for preserving the building  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  he has mentioned Mr Tay Kheng Soon, the architect,\r\n\r\nwrote  directly to the Prime Minister's office.   May  I  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are some general principles or  circumstances\r\n\r\nthat  his  Ministry  would look at when considering  possible\r\n\r\nchange of plans?  And secondly, may I ask whether there is  a\r\n\r\nformal  or  regular route for any such suggestions  from  the\r\n\r\npublic rather than everyone writing to the Prime Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, consultation is not something that\r\n\r\nwe have suddenly discovered,  that we have seen the light and\r\n\r\nnow  we  have  public consultation. If we look at  the  track\r\n\r\nrecord  of  the  Government, not just my Ministry  but  other\r\n\r\nMinistries, there have been extensive public consultations in\r\n\r\nmany,  many  areas.  In this particular area  alone,  I  went\r\n\r\nthrough in quite great detail the degree of consultation that\r\n\r\ntook  place more than 10 years ago, when the first  plan  for\r\n\r\nthe  Civic  District was mooted. It was not just a plan  that\r\n\r\nwas  put  up.  There  was  an extensive  series  of  dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions  chaired by the Minister himself. And  arising  from\r\n\r\nthose dialogue sessions, there were a whole series of studies\r\n\r\nthat were done. It was only in 1992 that the final plans were\r\n\r\npublicised and put into the public domain as a result of four\r\n\r\nyears   of   consultation  and  studies.   And   even   then,\r\n\r\nthereafter,  when  SMU was given the mandate  to  locate  its\r\n\r\ncampus in that area, I am given to understand that there  was\r\n\r\nalso  a  series  of  dialogues that  were  carried  out  with\r\n\r\nindustry professionals, architects and members of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a specific proposal came to us, we looked at it\r\n\r\nvery  seriously  because  the people  who  were  behind  this\r\n\r\nproposal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere serious people.  They put up serious proposals, spent  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  time,  money and effort in putting  them  up  and  I\r\n\r\nthought   this  was  worth  considering.   There   are   many\r\n\r\nsuggestions that unfortunately are not so serious.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nsome of them are frivolous.  I think those do not deserve the\r\n\r\nkind of attention that serious proposals deserve. This is the\r\n\r\nprocess  that we have followed. Indeed, the Concept  Plan  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be reviewed this year and next year.  My  Ministry\r\n\r\nintends  to  hold  a series of discussions and  consultations\r\n\r\nwith  the  public on a broad basis and, after that,  we  will\r\n\r\ntake  in  the  people's  views and inputs  and  finalise  the\r\n\r\nConcept Plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not follow that every single idea or input that\r\n\r\ncomes  to  us  can or will be accepted.  I think  the  Member\r\n\r\nhimself would agree that it is not possible for us to do  so.\r\n\r\nAnd  it is this very nature of consultation which gives  rise\r\n\r\nto  this result. Some ideas we may take in and some ideas  we\r\n\r\nmay  not take in, or we may not take in any ideas at all. But\r\n\r\nthat  does  not,  in  any  way,  suggest  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nconsultation.   If you ask me if there is a specific  formula\r\n\r\nor  process, the answer is no. There are many channels  open.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all,  there  is  a  proactive  approach  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  takes in terms of major plans and policies.  Then\r\n\r\nthere  is  the iterative process of feedback and  discussion,\r\n\r\nback  and forth, and there are other channels such as private\r\n\r\ncommunications.   My Ministry meets with the industry  bodies\r\n\r\non   a  regular  basis,  with  the  Singapore  Institute   of\r\n\r\nArchitects, with individual architects, engineers and so  on.\r\n\r\nAt  each and every meeting, there is opportunity for dialogue\r\n\r\nand  discussion.   And this is the whole  purpose  of  having\r\n\r\nthese  meetings.   So,  there are  many  different  channels,\r\n\r\nincluding  writing directly to the Prime Minister.   I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister receives many letters on this  and  many\r\n\r\nother issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the right way to go about it? What is\r\n\r\nconsultation  all about?  I think it is about  giving  people\r\n\r\nwho  are affected by the plans which, in this case, means all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, a chance to have a say in the plans before they\r\n\r\nare finalised. As a result, if we may have missed something,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nif  we do,  hopefully this will be taken care of.

From  our\r\n\r\nexperience,  going  beyond this to  learning  more  than  two\r\n\r\nlanguages will be academically very challenging and demanding\r\n\r\nfor  the large majority of our students.

We are glad to\r\n\r\nhear  from  the  Finance Minister that  the  Asian  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis is largely behind us.  Everyone could heave a sigh  of\r\n\r\nrelief.  Because it was not so long ago that during the  off-Budget  measures announced in June 1998, that  we  were  very\r\n\r\nconcerned about a protracted U-shaped or, as the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said,  W-shaped, and a drawn out regional  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  that could last 2-4 years.  The sufferings, not  just\r\n\r\nto  us, but also to the people in our neighbouring countries,\r\n\r\nwould be unthinkable.  Anyhow, we are all extremely glad that\r\n\r\nagainst  all  expectations, Singapore achieved a dramatic  V-shaped recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more remarkable is the fact that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  FY99 Budget is expected to attain  a  surplus  of\r\n\r\n$3.2  billion,  as  against  an originally  estimated  budget\r\n\r\ndeficit  of  $5.1 billion.  This is a gigantic turnaround  of\r\n\r\n$8.3 billion.  While on the one hand, we wish to commend  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and the Finance Minister in particular,  for this\r\n\r\nvery  positive  turnaround, on the other  hand,  we  wish  to\r\n\r\nbetter  understand two things.  One is the  reason  for  this\r\n\r\ndiscrepancy for the huge budgetary miscalculation, and  hence\r\n\r\nwhether  the  budget  induced belt-tightening  measures  were\r\n\r\nunnecessary  pains  for the people and the  local  companies.\r\n\r\nThe   second  point  is  whether,  after  achieving  such   a\r\n\r\nremarkable  positive budget surplus, more could  be  done  to\r\n\r\nreward the people and companies who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave rallied so solidly behind the Government at the time  of\r\n\r\nthe economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that for this year's Budget, the press had\r\n\r\nbeen  hard  put to pin a label or tag for this  Budget.   The\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  has been kind in calling it a \"something  for\r\n\r\neveryone\" budget.  But have not all past years' budgets  been\r\n\r\nsomething  for  everyone?  I think the best  description  for\r\n\r\nthis  year's Budget is that it is an e-Budget.  It is  an  e-Budget  not  just because of its strong biasness  towards  e-commerce,  but  it also caters to the elderly,  entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nand ESOP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I call it an e-Budget because it is an\r\n\r\neconomical Budget, ie, a Budget that is economical in  giving\r\n\r\naway just about enough, without being too extravagant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has achieved a sterling performance\r\n\r\nin  the  management of the economy and the  fast  turnaround.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we could achieve a budget surplus in FY99 as we\r\n\r\nwere   barely   emerging  from  the   crisis   is   extremely\r\n\r\ncommendable, as I said earlier.  However, for this year, I am\r\n\r\ndisappointed  that  with  such a good  surplus,  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  has  decided to so quickly roll  back  the  set  of\r\n\r\neconomic recovery measures, and has not given enough  goodies\r\n\r\nto   reward  the  people  for  suffering  through  the   belt\r\n\r\ntightening   situation.   Essentially,  I   feel   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  have retained the  bulk  of  the  economic\r\n\r\nrecovery measures for another year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that during the off-Budget debate in June 1998,\r\n\r\nwe had likened the Finance Minister, our good Doctor Hu, to a\r\n\r\nmedical  doctor  who was dispensing medication  to  the  sick\r\n\r\npatient  (the Singapore economy) which was suffering  from  a\r\n\r\nserious  bout  of  flu.   The  medications  were  the  budget\r\n\r\nrecovery  measures.   It seems to me now  that  just  as  the\r\n\r\npatient  is  beginning to show signs of  recovery,  the  good\r\n\r\ndoctor has decided to roll back the medications.  Has he  cut\r\n\r\nback  on the salubrious good doses of antibiotics and  pills?\r\n\r\nIs this wise?  Are we pulling back too quickly?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my concern is that the patient (which\r\n\r\nis  the Singapore economy) is just beginning to enjoy a sharp\r\n\r\nand  good  recovery, and then the course of medical treatment\r\n\r\nis  quickly cut back. Would the recovery spatter?  Should  we\r\n\r\nbe  consistent in going through the full course  of  recovery\r\n\r\nmeasures,  which are originally meant to be over  two  years?\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  why not add more vitamins and beneficial herbs  to\r\n\r\nfurther  strengthen the patient, and be doubly sure  that  he\r\n\r\nbecomes  strong and robust, and can run even faster ahead  in\r\n\r\nthe race?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in looking at the package of recovery Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures  announced,  I feel that the Government  should  not\r\n\r\nhave removed the 10% corporate tax rebate for companies.  The\r\n\r\n10%  savings  on  corporate tax would  be  very  helpful  for\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  further  fund their capital  expenditures  for\r\n\r\nautomation, IT spending, streamlining and restructuring.   To\r\n\r\nreward  the  individuals  in  accepting  the  belt-tightening\r\n\r\nmeasures,  I would have thought that they should be  rewarded\r\n\r\nby  keeping  the 10% personal income tax rebate,  instead  of\r\n\r\ncutting down to 5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is apt to call this Budget an e-Budget. As we\r\n\r\nmove  into  the  new millennium, there is a need  to  prepare\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  participate  more  deeply  in  the  New  World\r\n\r\nEconomic  structure.  The world is changing so fast that  the\r\n\r\nrecovery,  and a sustained growth for that matter, cannot  be\r\n\r\ntaken for granted.  The point is that with the advent of  new\r\n\r\ntechnologies, telecommunications and the World Wide  Web,  or\r\n\r\ncommonly  called  the  Internet, the world  is  changing  and\r\n\r\ncoming together at a very fast pace.  The essence is to be e-relevant,  and  not become irrelevant.  If Singapore  becomes\r\n\r\nirrelevant in the new world order, we will surely fall by the\r\n\r\nwayside and wither.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should be made to understand that in the\r\n\r\nnew world order, we are no longer competing amongst ourselves\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  or  just against our neighbouring  countries.\r\n\r\nBecause of technological and communication advances,  we  are\r\n\r\nforced  now  to compete with the best in the  world.   If  we\r\n\r\ncannot compete against\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  best  in  the  world,  we will become  irrelevant.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the DBS Bank is no longer competing with other local\r\n\r\nbanks, but against MayBank, HSBC, BNP and Citigroup and other\r\n\r\npremium  banks in the world.  Our NOL and SIA have to compete\r\n\r\nworldwide.  Even our small traders and retailers are not just\r\n\r\ncompeting against other local retailers and traders, but have\r\n\r\nto  face  up  against  the retailers  and  traders  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   Ultimately,  in fact,  they  will  be  competing\r\n\r\nagainst the e-commerce virtual companies, like Amazon.com and\r\n\r\ne-Bay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, people choose not only which is the best and\r\n\r\ncheapest retail store to shop, but also which is the best and\r\n\r\ncheapest  country to shop.  As a country, we have to  compete\r\n\r\nagainst other countries as the best place for our people  and\r\n\r\nforeign  professionals  to  live and  raise  their  children.\r\n\r\nPeople  also  have  many choices as to where  to  park  their\r\n\r\nmoney.    Singapore,   because  of  our   inherent   domestic\r\n\r\nconstraints,  has lost its gloss as the best place  to  shop.\r\n\r\nWe  also cannot lay claim to be the best place to live.   But\r\n\r\nwe  must  continue to be a place where investors are prepared\r\n\r\nto  put their money, and local and foreign professionals find\r\n\r\nconducive to work in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the backdrop of the New World Economy, Singapore\r\n\r\nand Singaporeans have to stay relevant.  The Budget therefore\r\n\r\nhas  to  address  two  key imperatives.   One  is  to  devote\r\n\r\nsufficient  funds,  effort and attention to  build  Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  an  advanced knowledge-based economy that  can  compete\r\n\r\nwith  the  rest of the world, and the second is how to  mould\r\n\r\nand build up our local people and capabilities which, infused\r\n\r\nwith the right measure of foreign abilities, would be able to\r\n\r\nmeasure  up  against the best in the world.   Our  Government\r\n\r\nleaders,  including  PM, SM, DPM and  other  Ministers,  have\r\n\r\nspoken   recently  in  their  speeches  to  embrace  IT,   be\r\n\r\nenterprising,  be  risk  taking and  facing  up  to  the  new\r\n\r\nchallenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On account of the fact that we need to compete globally,\r\n\r\nI  am  disappointed that the Budget measures  fall  short  of\r\n\r\ngiving a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshot  in  the arm for our companies and individuals  to  help\r\n\r\nthem to prepare and propel them into the IT age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and reputed to be\r\n\r\nthe richest man in the world, in his book called Business@the\r\n\r\nspeed  of  Thought, said that in the digital technology  age,\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  the years 2000s will depend on velocity.   That\r\n\r\nis,  success depends on how quickly businesses are conducted.\r\n\r\nThus, he means business is at the speed of thought, which  is\r\n\r\nat  the speed of light.  Speed itself is a strategy.  A  good\r\n\r\nexample  is  the recent saga of the sale of Cable &  Wireless\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  Telecom (HKT).  Among the many factors, including\r\n\r\npolitical, I feel that Pacific Century CyberWorks has won the\r\n\r\ndeal because of the speed with which they could react to  the\r\n\r\nnews  that  this company is available for sale and that  they\r\n\r\ncould  make  decisions very fast.  Hence, speed is important.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  let us leave this saga of the Cable & Wireless  Hong\r\n\r\nKong Telecom to another avenue for debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying earlier, I feel that the Government\r\n\r\nBudget could have been bolder, speedier and more generous  to\r\n\r\nhelp propel Singapore into the IT age.  At the corporate  and\r\n\r\nindividual  levels,  the Budget could  have  been  bolder  in\r\n\r\ngiving encouragement and incentives to those who dare to take\r\n\r\nrisks.  If the risk-takers who started ventures failed,  they\r\n\r\ncould be encouraged to start again.  For those who succeeded,\r\n\r\nthey should be richly rewarded.  Moreover, in the process  of\r\n\r\ncarrying out their ventures, we should review and ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  agencies  and Government  regulators  should\r\n\r\nfacilitate rather than put obstacles in their paths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more companies to embrace IT technologies\r\n\r\nand  invest in new ventures, I would like to suggest that the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister could look into the following areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, group offsetting of operating losses. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been hesitant to allow group  offsetting  of\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  losses  because of the concern  over  abuses  and\r\n\r\nleakages.  This is understandable.  However, I feel  that  in\r\n\r\nthe case of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngenuine  desire to venture into a new business,  the  company\r\n\r\nwhich  is  taking a huge risk can be allowed to offset  their\r\n\r\nshare  of  the losses in the subsidiary ventures against  the\r\n\r\nprofits in the other main businesses.  If operating losses of\r\n\r\nnew ventures can be allowed, a company's risk adversity would\r\n\r\nbe  reduced.  If the Government is concerned about  giving  a\r\n\r\nblanket  group  offsetting approval,  then  approval  can  be\r\n\r\ngranted  on  a  selective industry basis.  For example,  such\r\n\r\ngroup offsetting could be considered for approved investments\r\n\r\nin IT and e-commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, give pioneer status for start-up ventures. As\r\n\r\nin  the  early  years  of  Singapore's economic  development,\r\n\r\npioneer status was given liberally to new companies so as  to\r\n\r\nstimulate industrial development.  I think the same  approach\r\n\r\ncan  be  taken  for start-up companies in the new  pioneering\r\n\r\nfields  such as IT and e-commerce.  They are pioneers  indeed\r\n\r\nin  an  unknown and fast moving environment of the IT and  e-space.  They have to move at the speed of thought and compete\r\n\r\nagainst the best in the world, such as their counterparts  in\r\n\r\nthe  Silicon  Valley in the USA, or other  similar  start-ups\r\n\r\nthat  are  sprouting  in other parts of the  world,  such  as\r\n\r\nCanada, Europe, India and even China.  I wish to suggest that\r\n\r\nthese  start-up companies in Singapore can be given  5  years\r\n\r\npioneer tax-free status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above two incentives are meant to work hand in hand\r\n\r\nto  encourage a proliferation of start-up companies and build\r\n\r\nup a sizeable pool of financial backers.  Many of these start-ups,  perhaps  as high as 90%, will not make  money  or  even\r\n\r\nsurvive  to  enjoy  their first 5 years of  tax-free  status.\r\n\r\nHowever, for those technopreneurs and their financial backers\r\n\r\nwho  succeed,  they will be hugely rewarded.   And  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  benefit,  because we have managed, in the  process,  to\r\n\r\nbecome e-relevant, instead of irrelevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this widespread, I would call it,\r\n\r\n\"broadband\"approach is better than a selective guarded \"arrow\r\n\r\nband\" approach,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  uncertainty of  technological  changes  and\r\n\r\nvelocity  of  such changes.  We do not know  for  sure  which\r\n\r\ncompanies,  whether  a  large GLC or a small  start-up,  will\r\n\r\nhave  the  ideas,  responsiveness,  drive  or  creativity  to\r\n\r\nsucceed.  Therefore, by encouraging as many as possible start-up  companies  to  be  formed,  and  give  them  the  correct\r\n\r\nincentives  and  environment, hopefully, some  of  them  will\r\n\r\nsucceed.  Even those who have failed are not lost, since  the\r\n\r\nentire  process  will   help  propagate  an  environment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  of  technopreneurship and risk  taking,  something\r\n\r\nwhich  both  our  PM  and SM have said is sorely  lacking  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. For those who succeed, they will become  our  hero\r\n\r\nstories.  In Singapore, we are also in dire shortage of  home\r\n\r\ngrown  success stories.  The only often-quoted one is Mr  Sim\r\n\r\nWong Hoo of Creative Technology.  I feel we need more of such\r\n\r\nsuccess  stories,  as they are plentiful  in  the  USA,  like\r\n\r\nStephen  Case  of AOL, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com and  Lawrence\r\n\r\nEllison of Oracles, or Masayoshi Son of Softbank in Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is tax relief or double taxation allowances\r\n\r\nfor  IT  expenditures.  As a move to encourage  companies  to\r\n\r\nadopt  IT  systems and re-engineering of their businesses,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  propose that the Finance  Minister  consider\r\n\r\ngiving tax reliefs or double taxation allowance for companies\r\n\r\nwhich want to spend money to purchase IT equipment that  will\r\n\r\nimprove  their  productivity or efficiency.   This  incentive\r\n\r\nwill be particularly important to SMEs which are usually  not\r\n\r\nIT oriented, and do not have the in-house technical expertise\r\n\r\nto help them push into the IT environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, personal income tax reliefs for purchase of\r\n\r\ncomputers.   As I said earlier, I feel strongly that  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  achieved  a  substantial  surplus  of   $3.2\r\n\r\nbillion,  it  could have been more generous in rewarding  the\r\n\r\ncitizens.   Of course, the $250 CPF top-up payment  into  the\r\n\r\nindividual's CPF account is a very appreciated  gesture.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  I  would  like  to  propose  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsider giving a tax relief of, say, perhaps $500 a year  to\r\n\r\nall citizens who purchase a personal computer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective is to encourage all citizens, whether\r\n\r\nyoung  or  old, to purchase a personal computer (PC).   I  am\r\n\r\nvery  pleased to read about Government's intention to  commit\r\n\r\n$25 million over three years to provide used PCs to the lower\r\n\r\nincome group, as announced by Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Communications  and Information Technology,  last  week.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I think that the used PCs scheme may not be  enough\r\n\r\nto  reach all the households in the lower income group.  Some\r\n\r\npeople  may  not be interested in using used PCs.   They  may\r\n\r\nthink  that  it is too slow or it may not have  the  advanced\r\n\r\nfeatures  to excite them.  My proposal, which is to  give  an\r\n\r\nincentive of personal income tax relief to purchase new  PCs,\r\n\r\nwill serve as a meaningful gesture and a supplementary scheme\r\n\r\nto  this  MCIT scheme.  This will be particularly  meaningful\r\n\r\nto  the  middle and lower income groups to encourage  working\r\n\r\nadults  to  purchase PCs, whether for use at home or  in  the\r\n\r\noffice.  For those who are not paying personal income tax, an\r\n\r\nalternative  scheme  can  be  devised,  whether   the   local\r\n\r\nconstituency's grassroots organisations, such as the Citizens\r\n\r\nConsultative Committees (CCCs) can become the channel through\r\n\r\nwhich the Government can give out a grant of, say, $200  each\r\n\r\nto encourage the lower income groups to buy PCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to propose that, so as to\r\n\r\npromote   a  wider  spread  of  IT  and  computer  education,\r\n\r\nespecially  for  the adult or older population,  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister encourage adults to attend self-improvement computer\r\n\r\ncourses.   Again, personal income tax relief  of,  say,  $500\r\n\r\neach   can  be  given  for  attendance  at  computer  courses\r\n\r\nconducted by approved educational companies.  Similarly,  for\r\n\r\nthose  people  of  the  lower income group  who  do  not  pay\r\n\r\npersonal  income  tax,  grants can  be  given  to  designated\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations such as the CCCs to conduct computer\r\n\r\ncourses,  where  the  lower  income  persons  can  attend  at\r\n\r\ndiscounted rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is suggested that Government funds be used to\r\n\r\nfoster  knowledge  technology,  e-commerce  talent  pool  and\r\n\r\nskills,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  prepare our economy for the global stage, we  must  also\r\n\r\ndevote  money, effort and attention to build and enhance  our\r\n\r\nlocal capabilities.  Here, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am referring to\r\n\r\nhow to assist our SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we wish to promote a pool of companies and\r\n\r\nindividuals to compete against the best in the world, we must\r\n\r\nnot  forget  that  there  is the main  body  of  the  working\r\n\r\npopulation  and the SMEs which employ them who need  help  to\r\n\r\nchange  and  adapt to the new economy.  These  SMEs  need  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the technological changes in the market place, how\r\n\r\nthey can restructure or adapt, and how their owners, managers\r\n\r\nand   employees  can  be  trained  or  retrained  to   remain\r\n\r\nemployable.  This is how to remain e-relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said, some sectors of the economy\r\n\r\nare  not  fully  out  of the woods yet.  These  sectors  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to need assistance.  They are the retail,  tourism,\r\n\r\nconstruction and trade sectors.  They may think some  of  the\r\n\r\nbudgetary measures could mean that their recovery process may\r\n\r\nslow  down  or  take longer.  I would like to appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister to look into industry specific measures that can  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  to  continue to assist these  sectors  that  are\r\n\r\nlagging  behind in the recovery.  This could be  achieved  by\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  as  well  as the Trade and Industry  Ministries\r\n\r\ncalling  for separate meetings with representatives of  these\r\n\r\nsectors, so that their problems can be studied in depth,  and\r\n\r\nappropriate assistance given when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the local small and medium enterprises (SMEs)\r\n\r\nmay  be  slow in achieving a quick recovery because they  are\r\n\r\nbeset  with  multifarious problems, such as heavy  overheads,\r\n\r\nlabour and managerial insufficiency, low productivity, rising\r\n\r\nretail  and  labour costs and structural changes.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nbetter  liaison  and consultation between the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs  will give rise to effective targeted  measures  to\r\n\r\nassist them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by urging the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance to take a more urgent, bolder and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngenerous  approach  to  prepare Singaporeans  and  the  local\r\n\r\ncompanies to meet the challenges of the new economy.  As  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister has said in the conclusion of his  Budget's\r\n\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have to face up to the challenges of a globalised\r\n\r\neconomic  system and keep pace with changes . .  We  need  to\r\n\r\naccelerate the pace of economic restructuring. .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the good Finance Minister, do\r\n\r\nnot  hold back your pen, write in the benefits and incentives\r\n\r\nnow, so that we can be better placed to meet the velocity  of\r\n\r\nchanges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just\r\n\r\nlike  Mr  Leong  before me, I too find the  turnaround  of  a\r\n\r\nprojected  budget deficit of close to $5.1  billion  in  FY99\r\n\r\ninto  an  actual budget surplus of $3.1 billion, a  swing  of\r\n\r\n$8.3  billion, to be a great surprise.  Like a magician,  the\r\n\r\nMinister has managed to pull the proverbial rabbit out of his\r\n\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, maintaining budget surplus is a good\r\n\r\nthing.  On the other hand, perhaps we should also revisit the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  under which FY99 budget was  presented.   Time\r\n\r\nwas bad, prospect was gloomy.  Economy was in recession.   As\r\n\r\nwe  all learned in our first course in economics, the economy\r\n\r\nneeded  a  shot  in  the arm from the Government's  spending.\r\n\r\nFY99  budget  was supposed to do just that.   The  Government\r\n\r\nplanned  to  maintain  its  spending  even  though  it  meant\r\n\r\nincurring  a deficit.  However, by the close of the financial\r\n\r\nyear, the Government's cup overflowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that in arriving at this budget surplus,\r\n\r\nbesides higher than expected revenue, the Government actually\r\n\r\nincurred  $3.4  billion  less  development  spending   partly\r\n\r\nbecause  of  better prices and partly also  because  of  some\r\n\r\nlower   priority  projects  being  rescheduled.   Development\r\n\r\nexpenditure for FY99 stands at 6.9% of GDP, and that is lower\r\n\r\nthan  8.7%  in FY98.  The question is why should  some  lower\r\n\r\npriority projects be rescheduled?  Were there good reasons to\r\n\r\ndo so?  Is there a change of heart of the Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  trying to extend a helping hand to the economy  into  a\r\n\r\nhands-off stance?  Basically, in my mind, Sir, if prices were\r\n\r\ngood,  should  the Government not let out more  contracts  to\r\n\r\ngain  better value for money?  Should we not pump  prime  the\r\n\r\neconomy  a  little bit more by keeping those  lower  priority\r\n\r\nprojects in the pipeline?  It seems that some of these  lower\r\n\r\npriority  projects  might include something  like  pedestrian\r\n\r\nbridges, road widening and other civil engineering work  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  needed  sooner or later.  In my own  ward,  I  was\r\n\r\ninformed  by the authority that a pedestrian overhead  bridge\r\n\r\noriginally slated for completion in September 1999  would  be\r\n\r\ndone.  Yet even at this very moment, there is no sign of  any\r\n\r\nactivity.  Could this particular project be a victim  of  one\r\n\r\nof those lower priority projects?  If so, are there many more\r\n\r\nsuch  similar  projects?  As we all  know,  the  recovery  is\r\n\r\nactually spotty.  So would the construction industry  not  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a boost if these lower priority projects were actually\r\n\r\nlet as scheduled?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we are all aware that the Government has\r\n\r\ncut  back  on  MUP  and  IUP in HDB estates  because  of  the\r\n\r\nprojected  budget  deficit.   As the  economy  turned  around\r\n\r\ntowards  the  middle  of  the last  fiscal  year,  could  the\r\n\r\nMinister  not be more generous by allocating more money  back\r\n\r\nto HDB so that such upgrading programmes could be maintained?\r\n\r\nI feel that the Minister has been overly conservative in this\r\n\r\nparticular respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, looking at FY2000, it is noteworthy\r\n\r\nthat  development expenditure has increased to $12.9 billion,\r\n\r\nan  increase  of $2.25 billion.  But by doing so,  it  merely\r\n\r\nbrings  us  back to the same level of development expenditure\r\n\r\nas  in  FY98.   Part  of this increased expenditure  probably\r\n\r\nincludes  those lower priority projects I mentioned  earlier.\r\n\r\nIt is also pertinent to note that as a percentage of GDP, the\r\n\r\nnew  development expenditure stands at 7.8% and while  it  is\r\n\r\nhigher  than 6.9% in FY99 it is actually lower than  8.7%  in\r\n\r\nFY98.   Development  expenditure is an  investment  into  our\r\n\r\nfuture.   I  would like to see development expenditure  being\r\n\r\nmaintained at a higher level compared to what is provided  in\r\n\r\nFY2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What strikes me as unusual in this Budget is that close\r\n\r\nto  $1  billion has been set aside for new priority  projects\r\n\r\nthat  may  materialise in FY2000.  This is a very interesting\r\n\r\nsentence  in  the  Budget Statement, since  most  development\r\n\r\nexpenditures would require careful planning, and it is unlike\r\n\r\nthis  Government  to  allocate such a large  amount  for  new\r\n\r\npriority  projects that may come about within a short  period\r\n\r\nof  12  months.   So my question is: Does the  Minister  have\r\n\r\nsomething  up  his  sleeves?  Is he saving some  goodies  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?  If so, would he be kind enough  to  drop  some\r\n\r\nhints?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note this Budget provides a significant\r\n\r\nincrease  for  Education,  historically  the  second  largest\r\n\r\nallocation  after  Defence.  There is  a  15.3%  increase  in\r\n\r\nOperating  Expenditure  and  21.7%  increase  in  Development\r\n\r\nExpenditure.   This reflects the importance  this  Government\r\n\r\nattaches to education of our children, in particular for  the\r\n\r\ncoming  knowledge-based economy.  I hope this is not a  once-off  increase  but  part  of a long-term  investment  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now comment on the various tax\r\n\r\nchanges in this Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before doing so, allow me to report that the Feedback\r\n\r\nUnit  had  conducted  a series of dialogue  sessions  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of this January with the business community  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral public as a prelude to the Budget.  The Feedback Unit\r\n\r\nmoved  the dialogue session ahead of the Budget so  that  the\r\n\r\ninputs  of  the  participants  could  be  considered  in  the\r\n\r\npreparation  of  the Budget.  I chaired the English  language\r\n\r\nsession which was held on 17th January 2000.  Participants of\r\n\r\nthe  session for the business community were drawn  from  the\r\n\r\nvarious  chambers of commerce, small and medium  enterprises,\r\n\r\nas  well as selected corporations.  The wish list is  a  long\r\n\r\none and it is included in the report of the meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general consensus of the business community was that\r\n\r\nthe  recession  is  by  and  large  over.   Nonetheless,  the\r\n\r\nrecovery  is  spotty with some sectors, such as construction,\r\n\r\nretail,   still   reeling   from   the   economic   downturn.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies have suffered during the recession and are still in\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  recuperation.  The  participants  generally\r\n\r\nwould  like  the  Government to maintain  the  various  cost-cutting  measures implemented by the Government  for  another\r\n\r\nyear.   Doing  so will allow most companies to restore  their\r\n\r\nhealth to deal with the challenges of the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tax-deductible savings for retirement, one\r\n\r\nparticipant,  noting that expatriates are exempted  from  the\r\n\r\nCPF   scheme,  suggested  that  a  tax-deductible  individual\r\n\r\nretirement saving scheme be established.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On saving for retirement, it was noted that most\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  do  not  enjoy tax deduction for  their  insurance\r\n\r\npremium   payments  as  their  CPF  payments   exceeded   the\r\n\r\neligibility condition for deduction.  Perhaps additional  tax\r\n\r\nallowances could be given to insurance premiums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, Sir, these appeals found a sympathetic ear\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister.  He has maintained  a  number  of  cost-cutting  measures,  albeit at a lower level.   For  instance,\r\n\r\nproperty tax rebate is being extended for another year  at  a\r\n\r\nlower rate of 25%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate tax rate will be lowered to 25.5% from 26% but\r\n\r\nonly  from  Year of Assessment 2001.  With the withdrawal  of\r\n\r\n10%  corporate  tax rebate for this year, Year of  Assessment\r\n\r\n2000,  the corporate tax rate effectively will return to  26%\r\n\r\nfrom  23.4%,  and then later down to 25.5%.  The question  is\r\n\r\nwhy  should  we subject the businesses to this  variation  of\r\n\r\ncorporate tax payable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Minister is fully aware of \"tax haven\"\r\n\r\nprovision in many developed countries that would be triggered\r\n\r\nagainst  a host country when its corporate tax rate drops  to\r\n\r\n25%  or below.  As such, the use of lower corporate tax  rate\r\n\r\nto   make   Singapore  more  attractive  for   multi-national\r\n\r\ncompanies  has its limitations.  For instance,  in  Japan,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the \"tax haven\" trigger is exactly at 25%.   So,\r\n\r\nafter  this rate has been lowered to 25.5%, there  is  really\r\n\r\nnot much leeway left\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister to play with.  I am sure the Minister  has\r\n\r\nbeen   exploring  other  fiscal  measures  to   enhance   the\r\n\r\nattractiveness  of  Singapore to foreign  investors.   So  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  useful  if he could elaborate  on  some  of  these\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the half step in this fiscal year, it is clear\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government is preparing the ground for a  complete\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  all  the  cost-cutting  measures  implemented\r\n\r\nearlier.   So I think Singapore business leaders and  workers\r\n\r\nare well-advised to be prepared mentally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the personal income tax measures, most Singaporean\r\n\r\ntaxpayers express disappointment that the personal income tax\r\n\r\nrate has not been adjusted this round.  Furthermore, the once-off 10% rebate is also withdrawn altogether.  As a trade-off,\r\n\r\nthe Minister announces a few measures that while laudable, do\r\n\r\nnot bring about much immediate benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government has accepted the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of  the Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nAgeing  Population  to  implement  a  tax-deferred  voluntary\r\n\r\nsaving  scheme next year.  This is a good idea to  complement\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  scheme for those who can afford it.   However,  for\r\n\r\nmost  Singaporeans who are already putting away 30% of  their\r\n\r\nincome into CPF, I doubt many would be able to take advantage\r\n\r\nof  this  scheme.  Furthermore, for those who are  likely  to\r\n\r\nparticipate, they are either high-income earners close to the\r\n\r\nage  of  retirement or young unmarried singles  without  many\r\n\r\nobligations.   Although the details of the scheme  are  still\r\n\r\nbeing worked on, I would like to ask the Minister whether the\r\n\r\nsaving in this SRS could only be withdrawn after the official\r\n\r\nretirement age, as at today at 55, or otherwise determined by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  Would he consider not imposing a retirement\r\n\r\nage at all in this SRS, so that the individuals who put money\r\n\r\nin  this SRS could decide as and when to withdraw the saving?\r\n\r\nI  think  this  flexibility is useful and important,  and  it\r\n\r\nwould  encourage  the  individual to  save  for  rainy  days,\r\n\r\nperiods of unemployment,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndire needs, or for those who are prepared to go back to study\r\n\r\nby taking time off from working.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government is agreeable to allow foreigners\r\n\r\nworking  in  Singapore to participate in this SRS,  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  addressed the concern raised by expatriates during  the\r\n\r\nfeedback sessions I mentioned earlier.  It will overcome some\r\n\r\nof   their  concerns  regarding  how  they  would  save   for\r\n\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the extension of the tax\r\n\r\nrelief  scheme  for  CPF cash top-up for grandparents.   This\r\n\r\nstep  is  laudable but, again, I wonder what kind  of  impact\r\n\r\nthis   would  have.   First  of  all,  most  taxpayers   with\r\n\r\ngrandparents are likely to be young, below 30 years old,  and\r\n\r\nfurthermore their parents are still likely to be very  active\r\n\r\nin  their  working life; in fact, in the most  productive  of\r\n\r\ntheir  working  life,  and would be  able  to  support  their\r\n\r\ngrandparents.   These  young  taxpayers  are  probably  still\r\n\r\nestablishing  themselves in the world and not  many  of  them\r\n\r\nwould  be  able  to contribute up to $6,000 a year  to  fully\r\n\r\nbenefit  from this scheme.  Perhaps, the Minister can  inform\r\n\r\nthe  House  how many taxpayers could take advantage  of  this\r\n\r\nparticular  scheme  and therefore achieve  his  objective  to\r\n\r\nenhance \"inter-generation ties\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it not be more beneficial if the Minister could\r\n\r\nreview  the CPF cash top-up scheme for parents, but  not  for\r\n\r\ngrandparents?  There are many taxpayers today who  have  made\r\n\r\nuse  of this scheme to continue to support their parents  and\r\n\r\nhave  reached  the limit of the tax relief  for  cash  top-up\r\n\r\nbecause  there is a provision for the Minimum Sum  limit.   I\r\n\r\nwould  urge the Minister to review the limit of this  Minimum\r\n\r\nSum  so  that  those who have already reached the  limit  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to enjoy tax relief when they continue  to  support\r\n\r\ntheir  parents.  The Minister is aware that the  Minimum  Sum\r\n\r\nhas  actually been increased from $30,000 to $60,000 over the\r\n\r\nyears.   Depending  on their age, different  senior  citizens\r\n\r\ntoday  would  have different top-up limits.  The  older  ones\r\n\r\nwould be entitled to $30,000 and the younger ones would  then\r\n\r\nbe entitled to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n$60,000.   As  we  all know, the older the  person  the  more\r\n\r\nexpenses  he would incur.  So the Minister would  find  great\r\n\r\nsupport  among  Singaporeans  if  he  could,  in  the   first\r\n\r\ninstance, revise all the top-up limits to $60,000 so that all\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  reached  their existing  caps  today  could\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  obtain  tax relief for their  filial  sons  and\r\n\r\ndaughters who contribute to their support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would urge the Minister to increase the\r\n\r\nannual contribution limit from $6,000 to a higher number.   I\r\n\r\nsurmise  the  total  revenue loss if we undertake  all  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  would be a small number and doing  so  would  go  a\r\n\r\nlonger way towards promoting filial piety and the concept  of\r\n\r\nextended families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another tax incentive that I would like to see in the\r\n\r\nBudget  but  did not get a nod from the Minister is  the  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  for  the third and fourth child.  Currently,  the\r\n\r\nincentive is set at $10,000.  But this limit was set close to\r\n\r\n10  years ago.  It is time to review the amount and  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to urge the Minister to consider increasing this amount\r\n\r\nto encourage larger families for those who can afford it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has gone through a recession\r\n\r\nand  came through unscathed.  Our coffers are in great shape.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  thank the Minister  for  his  outstanding\r\n\r\ncontributions  as Minister for Finance during the  period  of\r\n\r\nhis  term  of office and for his stewardship of the  Ministry\r\n\r\nduring  this crisis.  Despite his recent health problems,  he\r\n\r\nhas   continued  to  serve  Singapore  selflessly.    Indeed,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are indebted to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  this  year we have the good fortune to  debate  our\r\n\r\nBudget  on  a happier note.  Our economy has got out  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties brought about by the regional financial  crisis.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine has drawn an analogy of the ups and downs of\r\n\r\nour  economy.  He said that each time we entered the Year  of\r\n\r\nthe  Tiger,  our  economy would face  difficulty.   From  the\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis in 1998, the recession in 1986 and  the  oil\r\n\r\ncrisis in 1974, it seemed to have formed a pattern or a  rule\r\n\r\nof some sort.  Fortunately, after the Tiger Year, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould be able to jump up again like a rabbit, followed by the\r\n\r\nvitality  of  the  Year of the Dragon and the  dance  of  the\r\n\r\ngolden snake.  The prospects seem bright again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may well be a great coincidence. In reality,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  blindly  believe in this kind  of  rule  and  our\r\n\r\neconomic  development cannot  be taken for granted.   We  are\r\n\r\nable  to  go  through the difficulties because of the  strong\r\n\r\ntripartism  that  we practise in Singapore.   When  the  time\r\n\r\nbecomes  better, we should spare no efforts in enhancing  the\r\n\r\nstrong partnership and nurture our togetherness as a nation - one  country,  one  people,  one Singapore.   Our  tripartite\r\n\r\npartners  have  to constantly work closely to strengthen  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness so as to expand our economic  pie.   In  this\r\n\r\nway, we would be able to safeguard our workers' jobs and also\r\n\r\nhelp to improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another main reason that Singapore was\r\n\r\nable  to  recover  so  quickly is Singaporeans'  ability  and\r\n\r\nwillingness  to  see the big picture and  accept  the  bitter\r\n\r\nmedicine to help nurse our economy to health.  This  kind  of\r\n\r\nselflessness helps us to recover quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the economic crisis, many companies closed down\r\n\r\nand thousands of workers were retrenched.  For those who were\r\n\r\nable to keep their employment, many had to accept wage freeze\r\n\r\nor  wage  cut  to help the companies tide over the  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.   We should therefore thank all the workers for  their\r\n\r\nunderstanding and sacrifices.  I am glad that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas decided to top-up $250 in each worker's CPF account.   It\r\n\r\nis  certainly a good gesture to reward our workers  for   the\r\n\r\nsacrifices  they had made.  This will also help to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  trust  in  our  leaders.  I  hope  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nconsider  the  suggestion that such CPF top-ups  for  workers\r\n\r\nshould continue whenever there is a good budget surplus until\r\n\r\nthe CPF cut is fully restored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to the majority of our rank-and-file workers\r\n\r\nwho  earn  a basic salary of less than $2,000 per month,  the\r\n\r\nsum  of $250  is equivalent to about 2% of the employer's CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also very glad that the ordinary Singaporeans are\r\n\r\nnot   left  out  in  this  year's  Budget.  The  service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy  charges, utilities and rental  rebates  for  HDB\r\n\r\nresidents amount  to $154 million.  If we take the  CPF  top-up,   the  contributions  to  Medifund  and  Eldercare  Fund,\r\n\r\nindividual income tax relief and so on, the total giveaway is\r\n\r\nmore  than $1 billion.  This is a glowing testimony that ours\r\n\r\nis a caring Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our economic recovery is not exactly an even\r\n\r\none.   Some sectors of our economy are not quite out  of  the\r\n\r\nwoods.  Quite  a  lot of workers are not free  from  worries.\r\n\r\nThey  will  be  happier if the once-off personal  income  tax\r\n\r\nrebate could remain at 10% and everybody will be happy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the additional tax relief for the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of parents.  It is a good incentive.  But I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Government would consider higher tax relief for those who\r\n\r\nlook  after their parents by making an effort to stay  nearby\r\n\r\nor  in  the  same HDB estate with their aged  parents.   Such\r\n\r\npeople should be given higher tax reliefs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are moving in this fast-paced\r\n\r\ncompetitive  world,  and as the Chinese  saying  goes:  \"Know\r\n\r\nyourself,  know your enemy and you will fight a  100  battles\r\n\r\nand  win  them  all.\"   We must know our weaknesses  and  our\r\n\r\nstrengths.   I  also  recall reading an article  by  IDEA  of\r\n\r\nLondon suggesting a looser monetary policy, keeping our wages\r\n\r\nat  a  competitive  level and containing our  industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial property prices as the key strategy that we should\r\n\r\nconsider.   I agree with these suggestions.  As  far  as  our\r\n\r\nwages  are  concerned,  we  have taken  steps  to  make  them\r\n\r\ncompetitive.   It  is  only proper that  we  also  align  our\r\n\r\nindustrial and commercial property prices to make  them  even\r\n\r\nmore competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a labour movement, our first priority is the well-being of our workers. We must see to it that they have jobs.\r\n\r\nWhen we negotiate wage increases, we always take into account\r\n\r\ntwo factors: (1) productivity\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngains;   (2)  the ability to pay by the company.   But  wages\r\n\r\nform  only part of the overall business costs, and, in  fact,\r\n\r\nonly  a  small  part.  It would also be good if the  non-wage\r\n\r\ncosts, particularly Government charges, could be held down so\r\n\r\nthat   companies  can  continue  to  operate  profitably   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and our workers will have good jobs.  It  is  only\r\n\r\nthen  that  we would be able to create a good environment  of\r\n\r\ndoing business for the companies and our workers will be able\r\n\r\nto have better jobs and enjoy higher standard of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Speaker, the Budget for the Year 2000\r\n\r\nwhich has been recently presented is a realistic Budget.   We\r\n\r\nare  indeed  pleased  to see that we  are  getting  into  the\r\n\r\neconomic growth again and this is encouraging.  I commend the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  taking various measures  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\neconomic crisis we faced earlier and the Finance Minister for\r\n\r\nhis good financial management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not easy to persuade him to do more than what\r\n\r\nhe  has  set  aside for the Budget.  I have tried hard  every\r\n\r\nyear to try and tug at his heartstrings to get more funds  to\r\n\r\nbe  released, but each year I have great difficulty.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat this year, with the new millennium, he would be able  to\r\n\r\nhear  out and accede to some of the requests that I would  be\r\n\r\nputting up.  I hope that he will be able to see what  he  can\r\n\r\ndo more for the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a few suggestions and observations to make\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  Budget.   With the  restructuring  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  expect  more  labour  intensive  industries  to\r\n\r\nrelocate  and  this will displace our older workers  who  are\r\n\r\nmiddle aged.  I think we know some of their problems.  But  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  we  need to monitor and see the  impact  of  this\r\n\r\nchanging economy in terms of their employability and how they\r\n\r\nare  likely  to be affected.  They will face difficulties  in\r\n\r\nfinding  the same type of job and salary.  They will be  less\r\n\r\nemployable  because they do not have the skills to  fit  into\r\n\r\nthe  changing  job  requirements.  The  employers  will  take\r\n\r\nadvantage to employ cheaper semi-skilled and skilled  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers and this compounds the problem\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfurther  as  they  tend  to pay these  foreign  workers  less\r\n\r\nsalaries  and, to some extent, the Minister for  Manpower  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to  ensure that we have a foreign worker  levy.   But\r\n\r\nsomehow I think they will find a way out to depress the wages\r\n\r\nfurther.   Sir, there is a danger of structural  unemployment\r\n\r\namongst older unskilled workers.  It will be painful for them\r\n\r\nas  they have teenage children to support, in terms of  their\r\n\r\neducation and other needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I draw the attention of the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance   that   funds  allocated  to  skills  training   are\r\n\r\ninadequate to train more than one third of our unskilled  and\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled  workforce.  In order to  make  a  good  impact,\r\n\r\nfurther  tax rebates to encourage employers to upgrade  their\r\n\r\nworkers  should  be considered.  More worker  training  funds\r\n\r\nshould be allocated to ITE so that it can work with NTUC  and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Manpower to implement a more  comprehensive\r\n\r\nplan   for   older   worker   training   to   enhance   their\r\n\r\nemployability.  This is going to be a critical  problem  that\r\n\r\nwe  will  face in the next five to 10 years, especially  when\r\n\r\nthe  economy  is being restructured and we are  moving  to  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy.  This has got a tremendous  impact.\r\n\r\nI  feel there is every reason for the Ministry of Finance  to\r\n\r\nallocate more funds to the Ministry of Manpower, trade unions\r\n\r\nand  other  sectors which can help to prepare the workers  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the challenges ahead.  And unless and until we do this,\r\n\r\nthere  is no point saying that the workers need to be trained\r\n\r\nand  we  need to prepare them for the KBE economy.  All  this\r\n\r\nremains  rhetoric unless we really translate them  into  real\r\n\r\naction and there is indeed an urgent need for the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance to allocate the funds because there is a surplus  and\r\n\r\nwe can do more for this group of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue that I would like to raise is that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are appreciative of the CPF top-up  of  $250  in\r\n\r\ntheir  ordinary  accounts. This is indeed  a  bonus  for  the\r\n\r\nworking   class  Singaporeans  and  I  must  say  that   many\r\n\r\ngovernments  cannot afford to do this. This is only  possible\r\n\r\nbecause we have done well and the Singapore Government, trade\r\n\r\nunions  and employers have worked together to try and  revive\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy.   This  is  an important effort  that  we  have  all\r\n\r\njointly  undertaken and I feel that the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\ncould be more generous as mentioned by my colleagues, Dr Wang\r\n\r\nKai  Yuen  and Mr Leong Horn Kee, who have urged the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  see  whether  it could roll back some of  its  plans  and\r\n\r\nallocate more funds for those who have contributed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister should be urged to grant a grace period\r\n\r\nuntil  the  end of this financial year, 31st March 2000,  for\r\n\r\nretirees  and retrenched workers to make one CPF contribution\r\n\r\nso  that they can get their CPF top-up. This group could  not\r\n\r\nmake  the  CPF  contribution  because  they  could  not  find\r\n\r\nemployment  within the cut-off period.  It would  be  a  good\r\n\r\ngesture  and  a  show of good heartware of the Government  to\r\n\r\nextend  the  benefit  to  them  if  they  can  make  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  soon.   I  hope that the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\ncould  look  into  this issue because I  know  many  of  them\r\n\r\ndeserve  it, and attempts could be made to see how their  CPF\r\n\r\ntop-up could be granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a continued case for us to review the\r\n\r\nstatus  of low-income pensioners and each year, I have  tried\r\n\r\nto  persuade  the Minister to see what can be done  for  this\r\n\r\nsector of the population and also for the poor segment of the\r\n\r\npopulation who need help. We need to examine more closely the\r\n\r\nimpact of the recession on their livelihood. Some of them are\r\n\r\nretirees, others are older and jobless persons and pensioners\r\n\r\nwith  low pensions.  They all deserve a little more attention\r\n\r\nfor   the  simple  reason  that  they  have  contributed   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's   past   development.  As  for   the   low-income\r\n\r\npensioners, I have sounded their plight to the Minister  many\r\n\r\ntimes.   I  hope that this time, he would open up  his  purse\r\n\r\nstring  and  distribute at least a one-time year-end  payment\r\n\r\nduring good times for them. We should not forget them as they\r\n\r\nhave given sterling service.  For the low income families and\r\n\r\nsingle elderly, it will have greater impact if rental rebates\r\n\r\nand  rebates for SC&CC charges can be increased  by  25%  per\r\n\r\nmonth.  This  will reduce their burden of increased  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving,  particularly meeting basic necessities, and many  of\r\n\r\nthem do not really\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  any income.  They deserve our attention and I feel that\r\n\r\nwe could do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has considered the need to encourage\r\n\r\nfamily  members  to take care of their aged parents.  He  has\r\n\r\nincreased  the tax relief for looking after the aged  parents\r\n\r\nto  $5,000.  This  is reasonable but he has  not  taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration the financial burden of those who have to  look\r\n\r\nafter  their aged sick parents.  I hope he will be  generous,\r\n\r\nat least, to this group next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to examine more closely the social consequences\r\n\r\nof   corporatisation   of  our  public   services   and   the\r\n\r\nrestructuring of our economy to a knowledge-based economy. We\r\n\r\nmust  see  that  public services remain  affordable  and  the\r\n\r\nworking  class  is not priced out of the market  to  purchase\r\n\r\ngoods  and  services.   The Government must  intervene,  when\r\n\r\nnecessary,  to mediate and enable working-class  families  to\r\n\r\nhave  access  to  services by levying  charges  which  remain\r\n\r\nwithin  their reach.  In short, many of these services  would\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  reviewed to ensure that they remain affordable.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  we would have a large sector which  may  not  get\r\n\r\naccess to the services for which they require.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consequence, if we remain aloof and oblivious to the\r\n\r\nneeds of this group, we can expect the social divide to widen\r\n\r\nand  people  who are productive may give up the race  because\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  catch  up.   Therefore,  policymakers  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in the promotion of KBE should look closely  at  the\r\n\r\ndangers of the wide digital divide and how those who have  IT\r\n\r\nskills  and  those who do not can be bridged  through  skills\r\n\r\ntraining  and education.  Here, I must say that  we  need  to\r\n\r\nprepare a younger generation of Singaporeans, as early as pre-school  age,  to IT exposure and deploy more  funds  for  the\r\n\r\npromotion of IT education at grassroots level and within  the\r\n\r\nmeans  of  the working-class families. The $25 million  which\r\n\r\nhas  been  allocated  by the Ministry  of  Communication  and\r\n\r\nInformation Technology is actually peanuts in the light  that\r\n\r\nthere are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany  people  who  need  to be trained  and  exposed  at  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots level.  The Ministry of Finance could, in fact, be\r\n\r\nmore supportive of this scheme and allocate more funds to the\r\n\r\nMinistry so that it is able to promote hardware.  Hardware is\r\n\r\nessential but without trainers and people to provide them the\r\n\r\nguidance,  exposure and education, it remains  not  effective\r\n\r\nand does not make an impact. And many of these hardwares will\r\n\r\nremain  as  white elephants in many of these centres  because\r\n\r\nthere are not sufficient attempts to see how the training  is\r\n\r\ncarried out at the grassroots level to those who really  need\r\n\r\nto be exposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should allocate and deploy more funds to the\r\n\r\nyounger  children within the community, particularly  at  the\r\n\r\npre-school  centres, and if this could be done earlier,  many\r\n\r\nchildren  who  belong to the working-class families  can  get\r\n\r\nearly exposure or an early headstart so that they could catch\r\n\r\nup  and remain in the forefront of the KBE.  Otherwise, if we\r\n\r\ndo  not do this, our drive to KBE would land us up in KJE,  a\r\n\r\ndead-end road for the less well-off families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, I must say that we have done well\r\n\r\ndespite  serious  social  and economic  difficulties  of  the\r\n\r\nregion. We will face more challenges when we restructure  our\r\n\r\neconomy  and  we must pay more attention to the  semi-skilled\r\n\r\nand  unskilled  generation  of workers  who  will  need  more\r\n\r\nsupport to cope with the changing economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I seek a\r\n\r\nclarification  from  Dr  Vasoo?  Dr Vasoo  mentioned  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech  that  he is afraid that there might be some  services\r\n\r\nwhich  may  be  out  of reach of the lower  income  families.\r\n\r\nWould he elaborate on what these services are?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> I think the Member should raise the question\r\n\r\nwith  the Minister or the relevant Ministry.

The prices that are charged should remain affordable\r\n\r\nso\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat many of these families, at this juncture, do get access.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  it  continues  to be  so  and  the  respective\r\n\r\nMinistries should see how subsidies and other related aspects\r\n\r\ncould be given to ensure that we do not leave out a group  of\r\n\r\npeople who otherwise need support.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, this year's\r\n\r\nBudget is an inconsequential one.  The workers have not  been\r\n\r\ngiven  any  significant benefits, neither  has  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity. The real beneficiary is the Government,  as  usual\r\n\r\nending up with hefty surpluses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let us look at the position of the workers. For\r\n\r\ntwo  years,  our workers were at the forefront in  the  fight\r\n\r\nagainst the recession which has gripped this country and  the\r\n\r\nregion since July 1997. The workers were the first to suffer.\r\n\r\nTheir casualties include massive retrenchments, pay-cuts  and\r\n\r\nlowering of the employer's CPF by 10 percentage points.   Our\r\n\r\nworkers  have suffered. They were the ones who were  affected\r\n\r\nmost by the cost-cutting measures, to hold back the recession\r\n\r\nand  not  let  it  get worse.  Yet, at this  time,  when  the\r\n\r\neconomy  has basically recovered, what do we see?  No rewards\r\n\r\nfor  the  workers, only pittance of small rebates of  service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy  and other charges for  HDB  flat  dwellers.\r\n\r\nThose rebates are less than the ones given last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two years' recession has left the workers worse off\r\n\r\nthis  year.   Last year, many of the workers still  had  some\r\n\r\nsavings  to  rely  on but after two years of  recession,  all\r\n\r\ntheir  savings have dried up. And this year, they  are  in  a\r\n\r\nworse  position  than last year. They should  be  given  more\r\n\r\nbenefits  this year.  I think the Minister should  have  been\r\n\r\nmore   generous  and  reward  the  workers.  The   employer's\r\n\r\ncomponent of the CPF should have been restored at least by  a\r\n\r\nfurther  2  percentage points, if not more.  I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat  the economy shall be adversely affected if 2 percentage\r\n\r\npoints of the employer's CPF contribution are restored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy of America is strong. So too is that of the\r\n\r\nEU.  Japan's economy is said to have bottomed out in 1999 and\r\n\r\nit is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  the  road to recovery.  The countries in the region  have\r\n\r\nall  recovered  from the recession and are  showing  positive\r\n\r\ngrowth  too.  For  Singapore, the NUS Economic  Studies  Unit\r\n\r\npredicted  that its GDP shall be 7.9% this year.  It  can  be\r\n\r\nseen  that  the  world,  the region and Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\nprospects  are not that bad.  Therefore, there is  no  reason\r\n\r\nfor the Government for not increasing the employer's CPF rate\r\n\r\nby another 2 percentage points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, there is already a restoration of 2\r\n\r\npercentage points of the employer's CPF to take effect on 1st\r\n\r\nApril  this  year.  I do not think that that is enough.  With\r\n\r\nthe  high  cost of living, workers in Singapore are generally\r\n\r\nliving  from  hand  to mouth and any cut  in  the  CPF  shall\r\n\r\ncertainly  cause  hardship among them, as happened  in  1998.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an increment of the CPF rate contribution,\r\n\r\neven if it is only 2 percentage points more, shall be a great\r\n\r\nhelp  to  the workers as most workers have to pay  their  HDB\r\n\r\nmonthly loans through their CPF.  It is really a sad day  for\r\n\r\nthe  workers on Budget day not to have any restoration of the\r\n\r\nsaid  employer's   CPF contribution rate.  So  much  for  the\r\n\r\ngratefulness  of the Government, for the sacrifices  made  by\r\n\r\nthe workers.  When times were bad, the Government called upon\r\n\r\nthe workers to accept a lowering of the CPF contributions, to\r\n\r\ntighten  their  belts,  to  accept  pay  cuts.   The  workers\r\n\r\nresponded  positively.   There were no  strikes,  no  trouble\r\n\r\ngiven to the Government.  Yet, when times are good again, the\r\n\r\nGovernment appears to have forgotten the sacrifices  made  by\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the two percentage points which the\r\n\r\nGovernment has restored to the workers, the other thing  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government could do is to lower the foreign  maid  levy,\r\n\r\nwhich  now  stands at $345 per month per maid.  I  have  been\r\n\r\ntold  that the foreign maid levy is higher than the  salaries\r\n\r\nreceived  by  the  maids themselves.  My  feedback  is  that,\r\n\r\ngenerally,  a  Filipino  maid receives  $350  per  month,  an\r\n\r\nIndonesian maid receives about $240 a month, and a Sri Lankan\r\n\r\nmaid receives about $200 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government makes the most money when a foreign maid\r\n\r\nis employed in a household in Singapore.  Yet, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  not  provided  any services to the foreign  maids.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not provided training for them  to  be  good\r\n\r\nhousekeepers or child minders.  The only thing the Government\r\n\r\ndoes is to allow them to work here and impose a heavy levy on\r\n\r\nthem.   The foreign maid levy, to me, is nothing more than  a\r\n\r\ntax  imposed  on  the maids.  The Government  says  that  the\r\n\r\nrationale  for such a high rate of levy or tax is to  prevent\r\n\r\nSingapore from being flooded with foreign maids.  With such a\r\n\r\nhigh  levy, the great number of foreign maids wanting to work\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  has  not diminished, but  still  continues  to\r\n\r\nincrease.  As we have heard on the sitting of  22nd  February\r\n\r\n2000 in this House, the Minister for Manpower said that there\r\n\r\nwere about 100,000 foreign maids employed in Singapore.   So,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  foreign maids working in Singapore  has  not\r\n\r\nabated,  but it is increasing despite the imposition  of  the\r\n\r\nhigh  rate  of levy.  The fact is that there shall always  be\r\n\r\nfamilies  wanting to employ foreign maids,  as  both  spouses\r\n\r\nhave  to  go  to work.  The cost of living is  so  high  that\r\n\r\nfamilies  generally  cannot  depend  on  the  income  of  one\r\n\r\nbreadwinner  to support the whole family.  As a result,  when\r\n\r\nboth  spouses are required to seek employment, a foreign maid\r\n\r\nhas  to  be employed, primarily to look after their  children\r\n\r\nand aged parents, and to cook for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employment of a foreign maid is a necessity for many\r\n\r\nfamilies  in  Singapore.  Therefore, no matter how  high  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  raises  the  levy, the families  that  need  some\r\n\r\ndomestic  help to look after their children and aged  parents\r\n\r\nshall  somehow find ways and means to employ a foreign  maid,\r\n\r\neither  by  changing jobs for higher paid  ones  or  to  work\r\n\r\nlonger  hours to pay for the increased levy.  The  policy  of\r\n\r\nhigh  levies shall never be a deterrent for Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nhave  to  employ foreign maids.  What is going to  happen  is\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans  shall seek cheaper  maids  or  employment\r\n\r\nagents shall force\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign maids to accept lower pay, which shall also not be  a\r\n\r\ngood thing because Singaporeans shall then get poorer quality\r\n\r\nmaids.  The Government should lower the foreign maid levy by,\r\n\r\nsay,  $45,  to  $300 per maid per month, for a  start.   This\r\n\r\nshall be a great relief to many working Singaporean couples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken on many Budget debates and highlighted the\r\n\r\nvisibly  large  surpluses accumulated by the Government  each\r\n\r\nyear.   The  people of Singapore are beginning to  feel  that\r\n\r\nthese accrued budget surpluses are, in fact, not the people's\r\n\r\nmoney,  but exclusively the money of the Government, although\r\n\r\nthe Government always says that they hold it in trust for the\r\n\r\npeople.   Much  of  these  surpluses is  collected  from  the\r\n\r\npeople.    The  opposition  suspects  that  the   policy   to\r\n\r\naccumulate massive amounts of funds by the Government is  not\r\n\r\nexclusively for economic reasons, but for political ones.  We\r\n\r\nhave  seen that in the 1997 general elections, the Government\r\n\r\nmade  it  clear  that  it shall only  upgrade  HDB  flats  in\r\n\r\nprecincts  that  supported Government  policies.   The  words\r\n\r\n\"support Government policies\" are an euphemism for the  words\r\n\r\n\"vote for the PAP\".  The residents of HDB flats were made  to\r\n\r\nunderstand that if they do not vote for the PAP, their  flats\r\n\r\nshall  be upgraded last.   The upgrading of HDB flats  was  a\r\n\r\nmajor  strategy of the PAP to win votes in the  1997  general\r\n\r\nelections.  The budget surpluses of the following  year  were\r\n\r\nto  be used for the upgrading programme of HDB flats.  As  it\r\n\r\nturned  out,  1998  was  the worst  recession  year  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had to announce a scaling down of  the  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme promised by the PAP the previous year.  The  budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses that were used for the upgrading of HDB flats after\r\n\r\nthe 1997 general elections were clear evidence of the use  of\r\n\r\nsurpluses by the Government for a political motive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this year's Budget, the surplus is shown as\r\n\r\n$2.45  billion.  This surplus is only the surplus  of  income\r\n\r\nover  expenditure.  The actual receipts or  the  money  which\r\n\r\nshall  be collected by the Government is actually about $3.41\r\n\r\nbillion.  This\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsum  takes into account what the Government receives from its\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  sale  of land.   When  we  talk  of  budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses, we are only referring to part of the money  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Government.  The budget surplus this year  only\r\n\r\nshows  $2.24  billion but actually the  net  receipt  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is $3.41 billion.  The statistics which only  show\r\n\r\nbudget  surpluses each year of the Government do not  show  a\r\n\r\ntrue  picture  of the receipts of the Government,  which  are\r\n\r\nmore than the budget surplus for each year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is touted that the Government has $150 billion in\r\n\r\nreserves.   I  do  not see the rationale for accumulating  so\r\n\r\nmuch money, other than the political benefits from it by  the\r\n\r\nparty in power.  The Government wants to awe the people  that\r\n\r\nit  has  so  much money.  I think the Government  should  not\r\n\r\ncontinue to accumulate so much money.  It is time to  release\r\n\r\nsome of those monies back to the people for their benefit, in\r\n\r\nparticular,  to  benefit  people in education  and  training.\r\n\r\nMoney  spent on the people's education is not wasted.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot a consumption but an investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government tells the people of Singapore that we are\r\n\r\nembarking  on a knowledge-based economy, and the majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans agree with the Government that we should build a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy.  For a knowledge-based  economy  to\r\n\r\nsucceed,  there  is a presumption that the  majority  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers  have  attained their basic education  and  they  are\r\n\r\nconversant  with  the   three Rs.   The  truth  is  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  our  workers  are poorly  educated  and  poorly\r\n\r\ntrained.  Since I came to Parliament more than 10 years  ago,\r\n\r\nI  have  been  hearing  that our workers  should  be  further\r\n\r\ntrained and retrained.  But as far as I know, no real success\r\n\r\nin  this  respect  is  in  sight.   Even  today,  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Less than half of our workforce above the age of 40 has\r\n\r\nsecondary  and  higher education.  We need to level  up  this\r\n\r\ngroup  of  workers  numbering some  834,000  or  42%  of  our\r\n\r\nworkforce  through training and retraining to help them  cope\r\n\r\nwith the new economy.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I suspect is that those 800,000-odd workers may not\r\n\r\nbe  able  even to read and write English at all, because  our\r\n\r\nschool\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem  has  automatic promotion.  Those who fail in  primary\r\n\r\none are automatically promoted to primary two.  They fail  at\r\n\r\nprimary  two and they are pushed up to primary three  and  so\r\n\r\non.   They finally fail primary six and they are put  in  'N'\r\n\r\nclasses in secondary schools.  And after one or two years  in\r\n\r\nsecondary school 'N' level classes, they just simply drop out\r\n\r\nof  school,  and  they  join the pool  of  almost  illiterate\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must make up its mind to put a stop to\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of  a  school system.  Otherwise, the  continuing\r\n\r\ngrowth in the number of illiterate amongst our workforce  can\r\n\r\nnever  be  stopped.  At one time, the Government  blamed  the\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of  uneducated amongst our  workforce  on  the\r\n\r\nprevious government, ie, before the PAP took power.  But  now\r\n\r\nwe  see  workers  above  40 years old who  are  not  properly\r\n\r\neducated.  All these workers have gone through the PAP system\r\n\r\nof  education, and 42% of them are not properly educated  and\r\n\r\nnot fit for the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only solution is that the Government must have a\r\n\r\npolitical  will to improve our education system.   For  this,\r\n\r\nthe  Government must release surpluses to spend  on  building\r\n\r\nmore schools and recruit more teachers.  I estimate that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should spend an additional $780 million more  each\r\n\r\nyear  to  really  give  effective teaching  in  our  schools,\r\n\r\nespecially  the neighbourhood schools, to make  sure,  for  a\r\n\r\nstart,  that all pupils at least learn to read and write  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  language by the time they leave school.  I recommend\r\n\r\nan  additional sum of $780 million to be spent to reduce  the\r\n\r\nclass size by one quarter of its pupils.  I believe that with\r\n\r\na  smaller  class size, the teaching can be infinitely   more\r\n\r\neffective.   I  have been informed that there  is  a  sizable\r\n\r\nnumber of students studying in HDB neighbourhood schools  who\r\n\r\ndo  not manage to read and write the English language at  all\r\n\r\nwhen  they  leave  school.  If this is true,  then  something\r\n\r\ndrastic must be done to our school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that I feel the budget surpluses can be\r\n\r\nbeneficially used is to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrain   more   of   our  local  workers  to  become   skilled\r\n\r\nconstruction   workers.   It  is  noted   that   almost   all\r\n\r\nconstruction   workers   at  our   construction   sites   are\r\n\r\nforeigners.   This  is surely not a healthy  situation.   Our\r\n\r\nGovernment should try to get more of our local workers to  be\r\n\r\ntrained  as skilled construction workers by giving attractive\r\n\r\nsubsidies  for the training.  At this time, it is  perhaps  a\r\n\r\ngood  time to do so when the construction industry is in  the\r\n\r\ndoldrums.\r\n\r\n<br>2.27 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has delivered the good news to  us  that\r\n\r\nhe is once again in the happy position of announcing a budget\r\n\r\nsurplus this time of $3.2 billion.  He did not dwell long  on\r\n\r\nthis  accomplishment,  but  he  did  pause  to  observe  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  had  emerged largely unscathed from  the  regional\r\n\r\ncrisis  and  attributed this to strong economic  fundamentals\r\n\r\nunderpinned  by  years of consistent and  rational  policies.\r\n\r\nWhile  I am fully in agreement with and appreciative  of  the\r\n\r\ngood  leadership  that has made possible  these  policies,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  have  been guilty of forgetting or of  taking  for\r\n\r\ngranted the other major underpinning of our economic success,\r\n\r\nnamely,   the   ordinary  Singaporean  of  whom   we   expect\r\n\r\nextraordinary    effort,   extraordinary    commitment    and\r\n\r\nextraordinary resilience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister moved on to deal with the challenges that\r\n\r\nlie  ahead  for Singapore in competing in the new millennium.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the increasing intensity of competition that will\r\n\r\nbe  inevitable in the face of globalisation and the onslaught\r\n\r\nof  technological advancement.  The times are  going  to  get\r\n\r\ntougher  and the pace even more punishing.  He spoke  of  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive   edge   that  we  have  in   hardware   in   our\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, and he identified as a key component  of  the\r\n\r\nsoftware  aspect of our competitiveness, the quality  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  He said, as many of our political leaders have often\r\n\r\nrepeated  in  recent  times, that as a small  country,  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  matters.   But  his focus  was  on  everyone  to\r\n\r\nconsciously improve their skills and look for new ways to  do\r\n\r\nthe job better.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a concern for the ordinary Singaporean, and the\r\n\r\nordinary  Singaporean  family.  In  the  face  of  these  new\r\n\r\nchallenges,  the  demands of the new global,  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy,  the hectic pace and the pressure that  starts  from\r\n\r\nthe  child  in  primary school and, in  fact,  following  the\r\n\r\nrecent accounts in the newspaper from preschool, how will our\r\n\r\nordinary Singapore family cope?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, we are beginning to see some fault lines show\r\n\r\nin  the  increasing examples we have of young people  getting\r\n\r\ninto trouble, not so much in the numbers perhaps, but in  the\r\n\r\nviolence of their crimes.  I believe all Members of the House\r\n\r\nhave   numerous  stories  from  their  constituents  of   the\r\n\r\npressures that the latter faced.   In the last month alone  I\r\n\r\nhave  heard of three families who have carted their  children\r\n\r\noff to Australia to escape the pressure.  Of these, in two of\r\n\r\nthe  families,  the mothers accompanied the  kids  while  dad\r\n\r\nremained in his job in Singapore.  What kind of a family life\r\n\r\nis  this?  And with regard to the children, will they  return\r\n\r\nto Singapore after their studies are done?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the far greater number of families who do not\r\n\r\nhave the means of this form of an escape valve?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not suggesting for a moment that\r\n\r\nwe  should, even if we could, stop the world because we  want\r\n\r\nto  get  off.  There is no turning the clock back and wishing\r\n\r\nfor  the  nice  comfortable world that used  to  be.   It  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  because  we cannot turn the  clock  back,  that  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  it is time for us to review all  the  policies\r\n\r\nthat  we have that impact on the Singapore family, to see  if\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  do  better in supporting and  strengthening  this\r\n\r\nprecious entity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House in October last year, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nspoke  of his concern with regard to two trends: the  falling\r\n\r\nfertility rate, Singaporeans not replacing ourselves, and the\r\n\r\nincreased  number of Singaporeans going overseas.   He  noted\r\n\r\nthat  there are many reasons for the declining fertility rate\r\n\r\n-  urbanisation,  education, changing lifestyles,  singlehood\r\n\r\nand late marriages. The stresses and pressures of modern life\r\n\r\nare  intimately intertwined with all of these  factors.   The\r\n\r\nPrime\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  was absolutely right when he commented that  simply\r\n\r\nthe  extension of the family benefits to fathers that  I  had\r\n\r\nproposed  in  that  same sitting would not be  the  solution.\r\n\r\nThere is no magic bullet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would take a wide ranging review of a multitude of\r\n\r\nissues  to  come up with a clear vision of what  outcomes  we\r\n\r\nwant  for the Singapore family, a decision to prioritise  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the family, and a clear statement in the  fact  of\r\n\r\nconflicting  demands  of the importance  of  acting  on  this\r\n\r\ndecision.  Follow through and implementation will take plenty\r\n\r\nof  political will and muscle, and the slaughter of not a few\r\n\r\nsacred cows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we are serious about making this vulnerable\r\n\r\nlittle  island  a good home for all of us in the  long  term,\r\n\r\nthen  we must approach the problem in a comprehensive manner,\r\n\r\nin  the same way as we approached our economic well-being  in\r\n\r\nestablishing  the  Committee  on Singapore's  Competitiveness\r\n\r\n(CSC)  to  map out a comprehensive set of long term  economic\r\n\r\nstrategies,  and  not have individual Ministries  take  small\r\n\r\nbites  at the subject in an ad hoc manner.  And as Government\r\n\r\nadopted  the strategies proposed by the CSC as the  blueprint\r\n\r\nfor  developing  Singapore  into  an  advanced  and  globally\r\n\r\ncompetitive knowledge-based economy, so we need in  tandem  a\r\n\r\nblueprint  for forming and preserving strong happy  families,\r\n\r\nnot just to enjoy the fruits of this material success but, in\r\n\r\nfact, to ensure that we are able to soldier on effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a slew of policies in place that impact on the\r\n\r\nfamily  in various ways, many of them enacted and implemented\r\n\r\nat  various  points in our history, for various good  reasons\r\n\r\nand  priorities  at  that  time,  that  altogether  now  send\r\n\r\nsometimes conflicting messages to Singaporean women  and  men\r\n\r\nas  they  make  their  way through life taking  decisions  on\r\n\r\nmarriage,  starting  a  family,  bringing  up  children   and\r\n\r\npossibly finding time and space for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just let me walk you very quickly through the factors\r\n\r\nthat  come into play at these various points.  For  a  start,\r\n\r\neven\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbefore  worrying about helping the family to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\npace  and pressures of life in the new millennium, persuading\r\n\r\nyoung Singaporeans that they want in fact to form a family in\r\n\r\nthe  first place.  For the young Singaporean deciding to  get\r\n\r\nmarried - yes, no, or wait?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have brought up a generation of youngsters on the lap\r\n\r\nof  economic well-being, who have very high expectations, and\r\n\r\nwho  place  economics - work and career - before  family  and\r\n\r\nhome.  And understandably so, when so much more tangible  and\r\n\r\nimmediate  rewards come with having a successful career  than\r\n\r\nfor  being  a  good  spouse  or  a  good  parent.   Expressed\r\n\r\nappreciation  from the boss, promotions, a good  salary,  and\r\n\r\nthe attendant lifestyle that this affords.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there some way to moderate these values? What could\r\n\r\nwe  be  covering in a life skills curriculum in  school  that\r\n\r\nmight  place  some  emphasis  on  the  importance,  joys  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of family life?  How do we engage parents in\r\n\r\nthe process?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a survey commissioned by the SDU in 1998, 62% of\r\n\r\nyoung  couples  felt that it was important to have  financial\r\n\r\nstability  before embarking on marriage, and 33% would  delay\r\n\r\nmarriage until a matrimonial home is ready, even if they were\r\n\r\notherwise ready for marriage.  There are limited options  for\r\n\r\nhousing  for the young couple just getting started  in  life,\r\n\r\napart from getting into the queue for a HDB flat.  There  are\r\n\r\nvarious  HDB grants and schemes to assist young couples,  and\r\n\r\nalso promote and facilitate extended families living together\r\n\r\nor  in  close proximity.  These are good.  And then there  is\r\n\r\nthe   Fiance/Fiancee   Scheme   which   requires   a   $5,000\r\n\r\nregistration deposit on application, and the production of  a\r\n\r\nmarriage certificate three months after taking possession  of\r\n\r\nthe  flat.   Does this push them into marriage  too  quickly,\r\n\r\nwithout enough consideration, resulting in increasing  number\r\n\r\nof divorces in this younger age group subsequently?  A review\r\n\r\nof  the impact and implications of the assorted policies  may\r\n\r\nbe timely.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the decision to have children, the first\r\n\r\nbaby.   Again, attitudes and values, weighing work and family\r\n\r\ncome   into  play.   Wait  for  one's  career  to  be  better\r\n\r\nestablished,  to  better afford the financial  responsibility\r\n\r\nthat comes with bringing up a child?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to have baby number three carries with it\r\n\r\nweighing the tax benefits against the maternity benefits,  or\r\n\r\nrather,  the lack thereof.  Dr Wang has made the point  about\r\n\r\nincreasing tax incentives for the third and fourth child.   I\r\n\r\nmyself rather think that one should be looking at the loss of\r\n\r\nmaternity  benefits and maternity leave for the  third  child\r\n\r\nand above.  In fact, I think the group that benefits from the\r\n\r\nincreased tax incentives is much smaller and at this point in\r\n\r\ntime  we are ready to look at encouraging a wider portion  of\r\n\r\nthe  population to consider having the third  child  and  not\r\n\r\njust the very top cream of the economic crop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking after baby. How many young couples are\r\n\r\nfortunate enough these days to have the family infrastructure\r\n\r\navailable and willing grandparents on hand to help with child\r\n\r\nminding?   If not, a decision has to be made between engaging\r\n\r\na  maid,  fostering the baby to a child minder, or finding  a\r\n\r\ngood child care centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the child care centre - the quality of care, the\r\n\r\navailability of a place in a conveniently located centre, and\r\n\r\ncost  and  subsidy, are all issues.  This is the one solitary\r\n\r\nitem  I  found highlighted in the Budget estimates  that  was\r\n\r\nspecifically  for  the  family - the 49 additional  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres  and  25  student  centres provided  for  under  MCD.\r\n\r\nShould we be doing more over and above this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viability of each of the options varies from one\r\n\r\nyoung family to another.  What is important, therefore,  must\r\n\r\nbe the availability of the range of options.  With one child,\r\n\r\na  childcare centre, especially with the available Government\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  may  be  a good option.  With two children,  it  is\r\n\r\nprobably cheaper to get a maid, who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthen  also  helps with the housework.  If the maid  levy  was\r\n\r\nless, or could be put aside towards a gratuity to be paid  to\r\n\r\nthe  worker at the end of the contract period, would  parents\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  afford  to attract and hire  a  better  calibre\r\n\r\nemployee, who can then act more as a governess in helping  to\r\n\r\nbring  the children up, relieving some of the pressures  that\r\n\r\nare  felt  in terms of providing a good environment  for  the\r\n\r\nchild at home?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the first baby arrives, the parents have then to\r\n\r\naddress  how  to balance work and home responsibilities  with\r\n\r\nthe  burden falling very much at the moment on mum.  To  stop\r\n\r\nwork, work part-time, or continue to work full time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a median Singaporean household income of just around\r\n\r\n$3,000,  for  many  of  the 56% of dual  income  families  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  continuing to hold down  a  full-time  job  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessity for both parents.  How to cope with the demands  of\r\n\r\nthe  current working environment, the pressures of increasing\r\n\r\nproductivity, constantly learning new skills, and yet  manage\r\n\r\nto do a decent job of bringing up a child and maintaining the\r\n\r\nhousehold?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at how to convince companies of the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of implementing family friendly practices  to  help\r\n\r\nemployees with this balance.  How can Government support  and\r\n\r\nfacilitate   the   process?   By   sourcing   and   providing\r\n\r\ninformation   of  best  practices  in  other  countries,   by\r\n\r\ncommissioning  local studies to demonstrate applicability  to\r\n\r\nour  own  environment, by providing tax and  other  financial\r\n\r\nincentives where applicable, and by setting the example as  a\r\n\r\nmajor employer in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These family friendly practices should include measures\r\n\r\nto  facilitate re-entry to work, when the kids are older  and\r\n\r\nmore  independent,  for the parents who had  earlier  stopped\r\n\r\nwork  to attend to family responsibilities full-time.   Then,\r\n\r\nwhen  the kids get to school, life becomes a pressure  cooker\r\n\r\nseething with anxieties and angst.  The study done by  Stella\r\n\r\nQuah on the Singapore Family, published in May last\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyear,  identified children's education as the single greatest\r\n\r\nworry for parents.  Over and above the simpler issues of  the\r\n\r\navailability  of before-and-after-school-care,  important  to\r\n\r\nworking  parents,  are  the  pressures  that  come  from  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum   load,  streaming  and  examinations   that   are\r\n\r\ncharacteristic of our education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has in recent years announced\r\n\r\nmany   admirable  initiatives  which,  if  and   when   fully\r\n\r\nimplemented, should go some way to dealing with the  problems\r\n\r\nand  challenges.  But there seems right now still a huge  gap\r\n\r\nto  bridge  between the existing and the desired  situations.\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam has asked for more funds for the Education Ministry\r\n\r\nto decrease class size and improve the situation.  I noted in\r\n\r\nfact  that  in this Budget 2,400 positions had been  provided\r\n\r\nfor.  Not only that, when I look at previous years, I believe\r\n\r\nthere  is  a huge vacancy rate in the Education Service.   My\r\n\r\nconcern  is not so much that there is no willingness  to  put\r\n\r\nmoney  aside  to provide for this, but how on  earth  are  we\r\n\r\ngoing to find the bodies, the brains and the hearts and souls\r\n\r\nto  fill up these positions that will help ease the position?\r\n\r\nThat, in fact, is key to the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ageing population, the care of frail elderly\r\n\r\nfamily  members  will  start becoming  a  factor  that  needs\r\n\r\nconsideration. Fortunately, in this instance, Government  has\r\n\r\nanticipated the problem and action has already been initiated\r\n\r\nin  this  area in the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee\r\n\r\non the Ageing Population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, changing the traditional views and practice in\r\n\r\nthe  sharing  of home responsibilities.  More flexibility  in\r\n\r\nthe assumption and sharing of different roles and duties will\r\n\r\nallow  couples to better manage the calls on their  time  and\r\n\r\nattention,  to achieve better outcomes for the  family.   Two\r\n\r\npeople  willing to pitch in according to their strengths  and\r\n\r\naptitudes without preconceived ideas about rigid divisions of\r\n\r\nlabour are going to be that much more effective and efficient\r\n\r\nin  sharing  the  responsibilities of  bringing  up  a  happy\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, we are seeing more younger men helping out\r\n\r\nin  more  ways with home responsibilities these  days.   Just\r\n\r\nrecently,  a  group of three young men have got  together  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  Centre for Fathering.  How can we  support  and\r\n\r\nfacilitate  this trend?  Training in parenting for  both  our\r\n\r\nyoung men and women is much needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you can see, many Ministries need to\r\n\r\nbe involved if we are to address the subject of strengthening\r\n\r\nthe  Singaporean family in a holistic and coordinated manner.\r\n\r\nNot  just  the MCD, the obvious Ministry, through its  Family\r\n\r\nDevelopment Division.  MCD, by the way, soon to be the  MCDS,\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Community Development and Sports, and alas,  not\r\n\r\neven  MCDF, Ministry of Community Development and the Family.\r\n\r\nBut also the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Manpower, the\r\n\r\nProductivity  and  Standards Board  under  MTI,  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.  Practically, every Ministry has policies and can do\r\n\r\nthings  that  will  impact  and that  can  help  support  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  family, as we push for all the  training  and  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial talent.  In the meantime, the Singaporean and\r\n\r\nhis  or  her  family,  that  is the  mainstay,  and  that  is\r\n\r\nultimately what produces all the energies and the engine that\r\n\r\ndrives  what  we are trying to achieve, I think we  sometimes\r\n\r\nstand  in danger of taking that very much for granted, as  we\r\n\r\nare  so  caught  up  in undoubtedly all  of  the  other  very\r\n\r\nimportant things that we need to pay attention to.   I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  family needs and deserves our  attention.   I\r\n\r\nwill  pick  up  in  the debate on the estimates  that  follow\r\n\r\nspecific issues with the Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I should like to call upon perhaps a more\r\n\r\ncoordinated  approach.  When Government feels that  something\r\n\r\nis  important, it places priority on it and straightaway  the\r\n\r\nresources  move,  and  you can see  this.   The  best  recent\r\n\r\nexample is, having identified the issue of ageing, we  formed\r\n\r\nthe Inter-Ministerial Committee on Ageing Population.  And we\r\n\r\nnow  have $200 million in the Eldercare Endowment Fund.   The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has introduced various tax incentives in\r\n\r\nthe Budget for looking after our older population.  If\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nonly  we  would pay the same amount of attention  to  putting\r\n\r\nsomething together for the Singapore family.\r\n\r\n<br>2.46 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us were anxiously waiting for this year's\r\n\r\nBudget  which we anticipated as a growth budget and one  that\r\n\r\nwas  going  to give a strong signal that Singapore is  indeed\r\n\r\nserious  about  participating  in  a  global  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy  which  is now at our doorsteps.  We  are  now  in  a\r\n\r\ncompletely  different  era  where  competition  is   not   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  nor is it in the region, but it is now throughout\r\n\r\nthe world.  Whether we like it or not, we have to participate\r\n\r\nand fight to win if we want to ensure our survival.  The good\r\n\r\nnews  is that we have a level playing field and have as  good\r\n\r\nan   opportunity  as  any  other  world-best  countries   and\r\n\r\neconomies  to  be  successful.  The  bad  news  is  that  the\r\n\r\ncompetition is going to come to our doorsteps and it will  be\r\n\r\nhere  whether  we like it or not and our old  ways  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness is not going to work in this future.  All of us will\r\n\r\nhave  to  make  major  mindset  changes,  including  how   we\r\n\r\nformulate the country's budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today I will be touching a bit on the strategies\r\n\r\nthat  we should consider in planning our economy and  I  will\r\n\r\ngive my detailed suggestions during the Committee of Supply's\r\n\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to talk about Singapore's\r\n\r\nrole  in this global world and the lessons that we must learn\r\n\r\nfrom others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is fortunate to have a strategic geographical\r\n\r\nposition  and through this we have developed ourselves  as  a\r\n\r\nhub  for various activities like trade, logistics and  travel\r\n\r\nand  as a language hub linking Asia to the rest of the world,\r\n\r\nwhich  were all very important in the `old economy'.  In  the\r\n\r\nnew economy, information technology will create tremendous\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nefficiencies  in the way goods and services are produced  and\r\n\r\ndistributed.   IT  has  also increased  the  productivity  of\r\n\r\nworkers,  and  it  is  going to reduce uncertainties,  create\r\n\r\nvisibility  and  transparencies and break any  barriers  that\r\n\r\ngovernments may try to erect to protect their economies.   So\r\n\r\nthe question is: are our infrastructure and hardware going to\r\n\r\nmake  the same difference in this new economy as they did  in\r\n\r\nthe past?  My contention is that it will not and we will have\r\n\r\nto  create  new competencies and use of IT will  continue  to\r\n\r\nplay  the role we played in the old economy, but we know that\r\n\r\nthe physical and geographical advantages are not going to  be\r\n\r\nthe  differentiating factors anymore.  Neither will  we  have\r\n\r\nthe   luxury  of  just  importing  and  transplanting  proven\r\n\r\ntechnologies  and  competencies  from  other  more   advanced\r\n\r\ncountries into Singapore as we did in the past.  Every one of\r\n\r\nour  competitors will be able to do the same or  even  better\r\n\r\nthan  us.   Our role therefore has to be one of an  innovator\r\n\r\nand  leader, capable of being in the leading edge of  things,\r\n\r\nand   be   a  choice  place  where  business  will  be   done\r\n\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent Cable and Wireless HKT and SingTel\r\n\r\nepisode  should  be  a  lesson  that  we  should  learn.   It\r\n\r\nbasically says that we are not yet ready to participate in  a\r\n\r\nvery fast moving new economy.  The paper wealth and the speed\r\n\r\nat  which  Pacific Century Cyberworks group  moves  are  good\r\n\r\nexamples of how things are going to be done in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worry I have is that this is just a signal and an\r\n\r\nindication of things to come if we do not change  fast.   The\r\n\r\nfact is that Singapore started talking about and planning for\r\n\r\na  knowledge-based economy about two years ago and many other\r\n\r\nAsian  countries, including Hong Kong, started  this  journey\r\n\r\nlater  than  us.   Hong Kong, for example,  has  leap-frogged\r\n\r\nSingapore  despite their later start and the danger  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore may lose out in its battle to be the Asian Hub  for\r\n\r\nthis  new economy and the Silicon Valley of the east.  If  we\r\n\r\ndo not change, we may just get the number two or number three\r\n\r\nposition.   And we as a nation, I believe, cannot risk  being\r\n\r\nin this position.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my speech today, I would like to touch on three\r\n\r\nareas  which we should focus on in order to be a more  potent\r\n\r\nsource in this new economy and these are:  (1)  Changing  the\r\n\r\nway  Singapore  is governed;  (2) Promoting entrepreneurship;\r\n\r\nand (3) How to build world class local companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Changing the Way Singapore is Governed</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many observers have advised us that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  rethink  the  traditional  strong  guiding  role   in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the country and the economy.  My suggestions  are\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we need an entrepreneurial civil service that is\r\n\r\nwilling to take risks in policy making.  In some cases,  when\r\n\r\nwe  are  unsure,  it may be necessary to implement  a  policy\r\n\r\nfirst,  based  on the  best of everyone's judgement  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, fine-tune it as we learn our lessons.  If we  wait\r\n\r\nfor  a  perfect  policy to be formulated, the battle  may  be\r\n\r\nlost.   Sir,  our  Government  and  civil  service  need   to\r\n\r\ntransform   its   administrative  role  to   one   of   being\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in the new economy, as we compete with the best\r\n\r\nin  the world, public policy making and decisions need to  be\r\n\r\nmade at very fast speed, which I call Internet speed.  And  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  from certain research that I have done, one Internet\r\n\r\nyear  is equivalent  to seven physical years in terms of  how\r\n\r\nfast  things change.  This means that we must be able to move\r\n\r\nseven  times faster than how we had moved in the old economy.\r\n\r\nIn  my  opinion, the loss of the Cable and Wireless HKT  deal\r\n\r\nwas a result of how fast our Government and GLCs are able  to\r\n\r\nmake  decisions.  Richard Li's Pacific Century Cyberworks  is\r\n\r\nan  example of how Internet speed works in this new  economy.\r\n\r\nIn  certain cases, decisions based on gut feel and on the fly\r\n\r\nmay be necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have an experience that I would like to share\r\n\r\nwith  the House about the speed at which things get  done  in\r\n\r\nthis  new  economy.   I  have started an e-commerce  shopping\r\n\r\nportal about six months ago.  I managed to build quite a good\r\n\r\nconcept in the last six months.  About two weeks ago,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  had a call from a CEO from the Norwegian company that  was\r\n\r\nalso  doing  a  similar portal.  And we started talking  just\r\n\r\nabout  two  weeks ago.  The true negotiations really  started\r\n\r\nlast  Friday  night  at  about 10.30  pm  in  my  house.   We\r\n\r\nnegotiated  through  the  night until  4.00  am  on  Saturday\r\n\r\nmorning,  and  we shook hands that we had a  deal.   We  then\r\n\r\npassed  on  the work to our lawyers who worked the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSaturday.   I  got  the  draft  legal  document  on  Saturday\r\n\r\nevening.   We  met  on  Saturday at 2 o'clock  in  my  place,\r\n\r\nthrashed  out the whole legal document, and by  4.30  pm  the\r\n\r\ndocument was ready.  At 5.15 pm, I left my home, rushed to  a\r\n\r\nhotel  to  sign  the agreement, witnessed  by  the  Norwegian\r\n\r\nAmbassador.  By 6.00 pm, the deal was done.  And this took us\r\n\r\njust  48  hours.    This is an example of how Internet  speed\r\n\r\nworks if you want to be successful in this economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should seriously consider my suggestion that\r\n\r\nI  made  in  the past, that of outsourcing the governance  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to the people and the private sector  as  much  as\r\n\r\npossible, wherever possible.  While certain sectors cannot be\r\n\r\noutsourced,  for  example, defence  and  a  number  of  other\r\n\r\nMinistries,  there  are others that can be.   And  through  a\r\n\r\npartnership, we will have a better chance of succeeding.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way, with a shared responsibility, we will be  able  to\r\n\r\nmake  better  decisions  and move faster  than  before.   Our\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies  will  do  well  if  they  act  only  as\r\n\r\nfacilitators and not as drivers in this new economy,  because\r\n\r\ntoo  much  of  Government involvement will only  slow  things\r\n\r\ndown.   So  agencies like the NSTB and PSB should  either  be\r\n\r\nprivatised  or they should modify their roles to become  more\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I feel that the civil service needs to be\r\n\r\nrewarded  differently  so  that they  will  be  motivated  to\r\n\r\ntransform Singapore to a knowledge-based economy.  If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  do anything about this, there will be a feeling of being\r\n\r\nleft out and a reluctance to change policies for the sake  of\r\n\r\npromoting entrepreneurship and enriching the private  sector.\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  we  need to seriously consider  revamping  the\r\n\r\ncompensation system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I believe that we have failed in attracting\r\n\r\nmany  good  people  with private sector experience  into  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  because  of  the bureaucratic  and  promotion\r\n\r\npractices  that  exist today.  People do not feel  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  get  what  they deserve and be able  to  advance  their\r\n\r\ncareers  should  they  move from the private  sector  to  the\r\n\r\npublic sector.  I hope that the Government can relook at  its\r\n\r\npractices to change things to attract more people of  varying\r\n\r\nbackgrounds into the Government service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we should not worry about perfecting and\r\n\r\ndevising  perfect  policies before we  make  changes.   As  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier, a little uncertainty and a  little  chaos\r\n\r\nmay  be necessary and may not necessarily be a bad thing  for\r\n\r\nthe country.  In fact, this type of uncertainty and chaos  is\r\n\r\nwhat  that  threw  up  the  truly  entrepreneurial  group  of\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  civil servants during the era  of  our  first\r\n\r\ngeneration  leadership of Singapore.  Too much  of  structure\r\n\r\nwill create complacency in society and weak leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Promoting Entrepreneurship</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without doubt, the promotion of entrepreneurship is\r\n\r\nthe  most important activity all of us should focus on in the\r\n\r\nnext  10  to  15 years of economic development,  because  the\r\n\r\nnation needs this new breed of wealth creators who will  then\r\n\r\ngenerate  jobs  and create a better standard  of  living  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, it was a disappointment that nothing new\r\n\r\nwas  done  and  no  new initiatives were introduced  in  this\r\n\r\nyear's  budget regarding promotion of entrepreneurship.   Any\r\n\r\nspending in entrepreneurship development should be seen as an\r\n\r\ninvestment and not as a handout.  I would have hoped that the\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus  that  we surprisingly got  could  have  been\r\n\r\nbetter spent in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a few things on what we can do\r\n\r\nabout promoting entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our tax system needs to change with time. I\r\n\r\nfeel that we are too caught up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  devising  a  single  tax  system  for  all  our  economic\r\n\r\nactivities.   I  suggest that the Minister  consider  a  mass\r\n\r\ncustomisation  approach, as the Minister  for  Education  had\r\n\r\nconsidered for the education system, to our tax regime as  it\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  proactive  in  supporting  certain  types   of\r\n\r\nactivities  like technology and info-communication start-ups.\r\n\r\nWe   should   treat  entrepreneurs  and  start-up   companies\r\n\r\ndifferently,  be it in how we tax them or in the  incentives,\r\n\r\ngrants and Government charges levied on them.  We should also\r\n\r\nfacilitate   their   growth  and  help  remove   bureaucratic\r\n\r\nobstacles.   For  example,  I feel that  the  employee  stock\r\n\r\noptions  and  share  grants in start-up  companies  could  be\r\n\r\ntreated  differently  from those given by  companies  already\r\n\r\nestablished  or  companies  that have  already  been  listed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  technology savvy investors could  also  be  given\r\n\r\npreferential treatment on how they are taxed or how they  can\r\n\r\nminimise the burden of investing in companies that eventually\r\n\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, capital raising should continue to be\r\n\r\nliberalised.   We  should make it easier to raise  funds  for\r\n\r\nstart-up  companies either through angel  investors  who  are\r\n\r\nwell  incentivised to do so and also by making it  easier  to\r\n\r\nlist  new  companies  on  a stock exchange  and  by  allowing\r\n\r\ninternational access of funds to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government should allow the private sector\r\n\r\ncompanies or individuals manage its funds.  If the Government\r\n\r\ncan identify a pool of well established local businessmen and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, we can develop a cluster of small  funds  that\r\n\r\ncan  act  as  catalysts  for  many  more  new  start-ups   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Currently,  the  Government  funds   are   being\r\n\r\ninvested  in  only  a few large and well established  venture\r\n\r\ncapitalists  who  can  serve  a different  purpose  from  the\r\n\r\nsmaller cluster of funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in the new economy, we will be seeing an\r\n\r\nacceleration  in  innovation, never seen before  in  history.\r\n\r\nThe  way businesses and companies are run will be re-invented\r\n\r\nall   the   time.   To  participate  in  this  economy,   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecome  knowledge  workers who must  be  prepared  to  accept\r\n\r\nconstant  change  as a way of life and to  survive,  everyone\r\n\r\nneeds  to  continue to learn new skills.  While once  upon  a\r\n\r\ntime  a  single  career  path and hence a  once-in-a-lifetime\r\n\r\nlearning   and  training  was  sufficient,  in   the   future\r\n\r\nenvironment,  this will lead to an early end of  our  earning\r\n\r\nability.   I  therefore feel that it is about  time  that  we\r\n\r\nrevamped  our education system and the values we believe  in,\r\n\r\nincluding the practice of meritocracy so that our workers can\r\n\r\nbecome effective knowledge workers of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing Local Companies into World Class Companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area I want to talk about is the development\r\n\r\nof local companies into world class companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the promotion and growth of many more successful\r\n\r\nlocal companies who can compete head on with any other of the\r\n\r\nworld-best companies is a very important task in the next few\r\n\r\nyears.  In this respect, I feel that we should have taken the\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  give  more  incentives  to   companies   to\r\n\r\nregionalise and globalise in the current year's  budget.   We\r\n\r\nnow  have  a unique opportunity to acquire or merge  with  or\r\n\r\ninvest  in  good  companies  around  the  world,  given   our\r\n\r\nfinancial strength and strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our quest to create world class companies, we have\r\n\r\nbeen  focusing too much on our GLCs.  Once again, the SingTel\r\n\r\nand Cable & Wireless HKT deal has shown us that despite being\r\n\r\nhighly successful locally in Singapore, many of our GLCs will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able  to compete effectively outside Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nhave  also  recently seen a number of other failed  deals  by\r\n\r\nsome  other  GLCs and my worry is that while we  can  compete\r\n\r\neffectively in our small Singapore market, we do not have the\r\n\r\nability  to compete globally.  I do not have the full  answer\r\n\r\nas  to  where  the problem really lies, but my feel  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  too  much  of  comfort  with  a  large  Government\r\n\r\nownership  in such companies.  We should fully privatise  all\r\n\r\nGLCs  and  let them be driven by market forces.  In fact,  it\r\n\r\nwill do the GLCs a lot of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngood if they are run purely on a private enterprise basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, since we are just coming out of the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis,  I feel that this is an excellent time to incentivise\r\n\r\nlocal  companies to restructure and consolidate.  They should\r\n\r\nfocus more and more on the value creation proposition and  be\r\n\r\nless  dependent  on just cost factors in  the  future.   Many\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries  have  been able  to  breed  world  class\r\n\r\ncompanies  despite their high costs and this  is  because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  focus  on  technology and value creation.   Nokia  and\r\n\r\nEriccson are just two examples of such companies coming  from\r\n\r\nthese countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should watch against rolling back too\r\n\r\nquickly  all  the cost containment measures implemented  last\r\n\r\nyear.   Delaying any cost measures by another one  year  will\r\n\r\nallow  companies to regain their full strength and they  will\r\n\r\nnot  have  to  worry about cost at this stage.   During  this\r\n\r\ntime,  they  can focus on their restructuring plans.   If  we\r\n\r\nroll  back the cost measures too fast, we may risk a reversal\r\n\r\nof  the  recovery seen by some companies.  We should  wait  a\r\n\r\nlittle longer before changing things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, in my opinion, after so many years, we have\r\n\r\nfailed  to  find  a good solution or formula in  helping  our\r\n\r\nlocal small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  I believe a major\r\n\r\nrestructuring  is needed in how we support and nurture  SMEs.\r\n\r\nIf  we  do  not do things differently, the recently announced\r\n\r\nSME  21  plan will have little chance of success and  I  will\r\n\r\ngive  my  suggestions  on  how we  can  do  this  during  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Supply  discussions.   But  the  gist  of   my\r\n\r\nsuggestion  is  to  let  the  private  sector  handle   this,\r\n\r\nincluding the administration of grants and incentive schemes.\r\n\r\nThe  various industry organisations and Chambers of  Commerce\r\n\r\ncan do a good job in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, e-commerce is the future for Singapore and our\r\n\r\ntraditional traders risk collapse if they do not embrace  the\r\n\r\nInternet  economy.   However, in the  meantime,  our  traders\r\n\r\nstill  need  some help, especially in the area  of  financing\r\n\r\ntheir trade and in modernising the whole\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\norder  fulfilment process, to compete in the new economy.   I\r\n\r\nfeel that the Government is not doing enough and is too quick\r\n\r\nto  decide  that the trading sector does not  need  any  more\r\n\r\nhelp.   Similarly,  I  believe that the legislation  and  tax\r\n\r\nregime  are  not fully ready to participate in the e-commerce\r\n\r\nworld and there is an urgent need to address this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new economy is already here. We have no lack\r\n\r\nof  capable  people  with many ideas.   What  we  need  is  a\r\n\r\nconducive  environment  and a sea  of  entrepreneurs  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate, people and public sectors to come up tops.  We  have\r\n\r\nthe ability and the will power to make it happen.  We must be\r\n\r\nprepared  that  we  may  have to  adjust  and  re-adjust  our\r\n\r\npolicies and strategies as we move ahead and learn.  We  must\r\n\r\nbe  prepared to give up certain efficiencies for the sake  of\r\n\r\nsuccess.   Now  is the time to act, so I hope the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  urgently  address the issues that  Members  will  raise\r\n\r\nduring the next 10 days of debate regarding the promotion  of\r\n\r\nenterpreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, over the years, it has become a somewhat popular Shenton\r\n\r\nWay  tradition to attach terms to describe the Budget.   This\r\n\r\nmillennium Budget is no exception.  Some have called it  \"The\r\n\r\nGood  Old  Budget\" in respect of the SRS and tax reliefs  for\r\n\r\ndependent parents and aged grandparents.  Others have  called\r\n\r\nit  \"The  Cyber Budget\" in recognition of the tax initiatives\r\n\r\nfor  an increasingly borderless virtual world.  But it  is  a\r\n\r\nbothersome Budget for taxpayers who were disappointed by  the\r\n\r\nfull  or partial withdrawal of a number of rebates.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard, some have even called it \"The Withdrawal Budget\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these are quite unfair terms that have been\r\n\r\ncoined  out  of  parochial interests.  It is  unfair  because\r\n\r\npeople  conveniently chose to overlook a  possible  GST  hike\r\n\r\nthat  did not materialise.  It is unfair because people chose\r\n\r\nto forget the conditions attached to one-off rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPersonally,  I  prefer  the term \"measured  Budget\"  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister's   measured  fiscal  response  to  the   millennium\r\n\r\nchallenges.  It is a measured response because the withdrawal\r\n\r\nof  each  rebate appears to be followed by a concomitant  new\r\n\r\ntax  initiative.  It is a measured response because while  we\r\n\r\nsee  great  challenges ahead, we must not lose sight  of  the\r\n\r\nlessons that we have learned from the recession, that we need\r\n\r\nto  remain  competitive, that a continued bright  outlook  is\r\n\r\nsometimes contingent upon forces and factors entirely  beyond\r\n\r\nour  control.   And so, Sir, there are merits in  adopting  a\r\n\r\nmeasured  fiscal approach.  For this reason,  I  support  the\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like the Minister to consider a scenario\r\n\r\nthat  assumes  the challenges to be somewhat more  compelling\r\n\r\nand  that  requires a slightly more rigorous fiscal approach.\r\n\r\nWhat  happens  when  the twin forces of IT and  globalisation\r\n\r\nrequire stronger response from the Government?  What are some\r\n\r\npositive tax initiatives to accelerate the path to become the\r\n\r\nAsian  Silicon  Valley and to maintain our  position  as  the\r\n\r\nregional  business hub?  What tax measures can be  considered\r\n\r\nto  encourage our local companies to think bigger, enter into\r\n\r\nnew  markets and invest more boldly?  How can we give  a  tax\r\n\r\nboost  to  companies  that  are  still  struggling  from  the\r\n\r\nlingering  effects  of the economic downturn?   We  ought  to\r\n\r\nvisit these issues and attempt to answer these questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, companies that are still facing economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  The V-shape rebound is understandably met by a\r\n\r\nU-turn  in  recession year tax rebates.  The  conditions  for\r\n\r\nthese rebates were laid out beforehand by the Minister.  Once\r\n\r\nthe  economy improves, the rationale for the rebate collapses\r\n\r\nand  reason compels that the rebates be removed.  If specific\r\n\r\nbusiness  sectors  require  a post-recovery  boost,  new  tax\r\n\r\nmeasures should be designed to deal with a specific issue  at\r\n\r\nhand.   This  seems to be the measured approach  adopted  for\r\n\r\nthis   Budget.   But,  Sir,  have  companies  and  businesses\r\n\r\nrecovered  entirely from this recession?  Statistics  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  our  growth is not broad-based across all sectors.   In\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncourse  of my day-to-day business dealings, I have also  come\r\n\r\nacross many people who feel that we are not fully out of  the\r\n\r\nwoods.   Many SMEs are still struggling.  Many SMEs bore  the\r\n\r\nbrunt  of  the recession, much harder than larger businesses.\r\n\r\nThe  withdrawal  of rebates will again hurt  them  harder  in\r\n\r\nrelative terms as compared to larger businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are genuinely concerned about growing our\r\n\r\nlocal SMEs into world class companies, we will need to create\r\n\r\na  conducive  environment  for them  to  grow.   A  conducive\r\n\r\nphysical  environment  should be part of  the  blueprint  for\r\n\r\nlocal  SME  growth.  Instead of a flat corporate  income  tax\r\n\r\nrate  for  all  companies, we might consider  implementing  a\r\n\r\nlower  rate  of  income tax for local SMEs.   SMEs  that  are\r\n\r\nwholly owned by Singaporeans could be subject to a lower rate\r\n\r\nof  tax,  say,  16% on the first million of income  which  is\r\n\r\nploughed  back  into  the  business and  not  distributed  as\r\n\r\ndividends.  Low rates will allow the SMEs to build  up  their\r\n\r\nreserve  to better weather economic downturn that will  occur\r\n\r\nin the future as part of the normal business cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of helping SMEs still suffering from the\r\n\r\nlingering  effects of the recession, consideration should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  allowing  SMEs to use losses incurred  during  the\r\n\r\nrecession  years  of 1998 and 1999 against income  earned  in\r\n\r\nprevious  years.   This  ability to  so-called  \"carry  back\"\r\n\r\nlosses  would  greatly benefit SMEs that are facing  cashflow\r\n\r\nproblems  and  financial difficulties now.  The  current  tax\r\n\r\nrules  allowing for the carry forward of losses  is  only  of\r\n\r\nbenefit  if  a  company  actually survives  the  recessionary\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the topic of providing relief for tax losses, I\r\n\r\nwould  also like to raise the issue of corporate group relief\r\n\r\nfor  losses.   Businesses  under  the  common  control  of  a\r\n\r\nshareholder,  or group of shareholders, may be  organised  in\r\n\r\nseparate  companies for a variety of reasons.  This corporate\r\n\r\nseparation,  while real in the legal sense, is artificial  in\r\n\r\nthe  business sense from the perspective of the  owners.   We\r\n\r\nhear  the  Government's message that the more entrepreneurial\r\n\r\napproach of style is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneeded to sustain us beyond the millennium in the face of the\r\n\r\ntough  regional  competition.  But the  willingness  to  take\r\n\r\nstructured   risks   may  manifest  itself   in   operational\r\n\r\nstructures, giving rise to quarantine losses.  Our tax  rules\r\n\r\ndo  not  permit  losses in one company to be  offset  against\r\n\r\nprofits in another company even if one person owns both.   If\r\n\r\nthe  two  businesses were run out of the  same  company,  the\r\n\r\nlosses would implicitly reduce the profits resulting in  less\r\n\r\ntax.  In effect, by not allowing inter-corporate losses,  and\r\n\r\nI  use  the term loosely, the effective tax rate is  actually\r\n\r\nhigher than 25.5% for the above companies taken together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with certain other countries, I suggest we\r\n\r\nseriously  look into the concept of group loss  relief.   The\r\n\r\nstructured  separation of businesses and risks into  separate\r\n\r\ncompanies should not lead to the very real problem of  taxing\r\n\r\na  corporate  group at a tax rate that is effectively  higher\r\n\r\nthan the statutory rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to focus on the other possible tax\r\n\r\nmeasures   to  boost  our  regionalisation  efforts   in   an\r\n\r\nincreasingly  globalised  world.   Risks  are  involved   for\r\n\r\ncompanies  going regional.  Investment and external financing\r\n\r\nare   required.    Interest  costs,  in  some   cases   quite\r\n\r\nsubstantial,  are  incurred.  In initial years,  the  company\r\n\r\ninvested  may  be  expected to operate with little,  if  any,\r\n\r\nprofits.   It  will  take time for them  to  build  up  their\r\n\r\nreserves  in  order for such companies to repatriate  profits\r\n\r\nback to Singapore.  We can try to minimise the time needed by\r\n\r\nlocal  companies  going regional to build up their  reserves.\r\n\r\nWe can try to help our local companies to be competitive in a\r\n\r\nglobal environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current tax rules do not allow funding costs to be\r\n\r\ndeducted  if  the investment does not produce  income.   This\r\n\r\nserves as a disincentive for local companies to seek regional\r\n\r\nexpansion  opportunities.  We can assist  such  companies  by\r\n\r\nallowing  them  to  accumulate expenses in  periods  when  no\r\n\r\nincome  is  earned and allowing them to deduct such  expenses\r\n\r\nwhen the investment starts to produce income.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSuch  rules could be targeted specifically to costs  incurred\r\n\r\nin  regional expansion activities, such as funding and  legal\r\n\r\ncosts, and would help companies that are starting to plan for\r\n\r\nregional    expansion.     The   tax   authorities    already\r\n\r\nadministratively  allow  expenses  to  be   accumulated   and\r\n\r\ndeducted in future years where foreign income is earned,  but\r\n\r\nnot brought into Singapore in a given year.  It is not such a\r\n\r\ngreat  extension  to  allow expenses  to  be  accumulated  on\r\n\r\ncertain expansionary activities to be treated similarly.\r\n\r\nOn  top  of  helping  companies to get  started  in  regional\r\n\r\nexpansion,  we should also think forwardly and  consider  how\r\n\r\nbest to allow successful companies to reinvest their overseas\r\n\r\nprofits.  Currently, foreign taxes paid by a second or  third\r\n\r\ntier  of  foreign company may not be recognised in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhen the Singapore parent company receives dividends from its\r\n\r\noverseas   subsidiaries  through  an  offshore   intermediate\r\n\r\nholding  company.  Since credit is not given for such foreign\r\n\r\ntaxes  suffered  at  the  second and third  tier  level,  the\r\n\r\noverseas  income  that  is  brought  back  to  Singapore   is\r\n\r\neffectively  taxed  twice, once by the foreign  country,  and\r\n\r\nonce  by  Singapore.   This may act as a  disincentive  to  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  company  that  has  been  successful  abroad  from\r\n\r\nreinvesting  in Singapore even if the best opportunities  are\r\n\r\navailable  at  home.  We should remove this  potential  road-block and, as a general rule, allow companies to look through\r\n\r\nintermediate  holding  companies  in  foreign  countries  and\r\n\r\nreceive credit for foreign taxes paid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to issues affecting individuals. The\r\n\r\nMinister,  in  his Budget speech, stated that only  employees\r\n\r\nwill be eligible for the Supplementary Retirement Scheme.  It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  appear that any provision has been made  to  allow\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  business owners, such as  the  self-employed\r\n\r\nlike sole proprietors and partnerships, to take advantage  of\r\n\r\nthis  scheme.   It appears strange that the scheme  does  not\r\n\r\napply  to SME entrepreneurs who are willing to take risks  in\r\n\r\nthe  prime  of their life.  There is no guarantee that  their\r\n\r\nventures will succeed. There is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nno  certainty  that  having risked it all,  they  would  have\r\n\r\nenough for their old age. As it is, the CPF contribution rate\r\n\r\nfor  the self-employed is already capped at $14,400 per year.\r\n\r\nIs  this  enough  for them in the long-term?  What  if  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses  do  not  prove  to  be  successful  in  the  next\r\n\r\nrecession?   Should  we  try  to help  them  build  up  their\r\n\r\nreserves  as  well?  Depriving entrepreneurs of the  old  age\r\n\r\nsafety  net  may  not be the way to forge a more  risk-taking\r\n\r\nmentality  among  Singaporeans. We need to  support  them  by\r\n\r\nputting  in  place  provisions to facilitate  their  personal\r\n\r\nfinancial  planning for old age. We need to ensure  that  any\r\n\r\nGovernment  initiative  does not indirectly  prejudice  their\r\n\r\nability  to  achieve long-term personal financial goals.  For\r\n\r\nthese  reasons,  we  should make the  scheme  open  to  self-employed entrepreneurs in addition to employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the Government's desire to create a more\r\n\r\ninnovative   business   environment   and   consistent   with\r\n\r\nremuneration  trends  in the world of technopreneurship,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has introduced provisions governing the  taxation\r\n\r\nof  employee stock option schemes. The business community, as\r\n\r\na  whole,  is encouraged by the Government's plan to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  tax  treatment of such schemes and has much  focused  in\r\n\r\nthis area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this scrutiny, we need to carefully consider\r\n\r\nhow best to motivate companies to make more widespread use of\r\n\r\nsuch schemes when warranted and we need to determine how best\r\n\r\nto  motivate key employees in an organisation to  take  long-term  stakes in the company they work for.  We have  seen  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  how  speculation, be it in the share  counters  or\r\n\r\nproperties, destabilises and undercuts the society's economic\r\n\r\nand  social progress. We need policies that encourage  people\r\n\r\nto  take  a longer term view of things.  I, like the rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  business  community, will wait  with  interest  for  the\r\n\r\ndetails  in  respect of the stock option scheme.  However,  I\r\n\r\nwould encourage the Ministry to improve the taxation of  such\r\n\r\nschemes  to encourage the long-term development of the  stock\r\n\r\noption schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides proposing tax initiatives to face the challenges\r\n\r\nin  the economy, I would also like to very briefly comment on\r\n\r\na  few  other  issues.  The first is the need to  review  the\r\n\r\nthreshold  parameters  for  estate  duty.  For  example,   in\r\n\r\nrelation  to estate duty, the use of $600,000 as a  threshold\r\n\r\nfor non-property exemption seems to be inadequate. After all,\r\n\r\nthe  $600,000 is inclusive of CPF which nowadays, as a result\r\n\r\nof  higher  income  and better investment  opportunities,  is\r\n\r\neasily  achieved.   The current exemption scheme  appears  to\r\n\r\nfavour  the  very wealthy, or at least those with significant\r\n\r\nproperty    ownership   and   their   investment   portfolio.\r\n\r\nConsideration  should be given to revising upwards  the  non-property  exemption  to allow or, more radically,  abolishing\r\n\r\nestate  duty  on  all non-property assets  and  allowing  for\r\n\r\nestate  duty to be levied only on real properties passing  in\r\n\r\nexcess   of,   say,   $9  million.   This   would   encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to adopt a wider investment strategy rather than\r\n\r\nto be overly tied down and exposed to the property market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern deals with the personal reliefs\r\n\r\ngenerally.  Such reliefs do not appear to have kept  up  with\r\n\r\nthe  times.  We have introduced business tax measures to keep\r\n\r\nup with the move towards technopreneurship in the economy. We\r\n\r\nshould  consider measures to keep up with changes in society.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the personal income threshold of $2,000 for the\r\n\r\nwife  relief  does not appear realistic given  the  financial\r\n\r\npattern  of today's families.  I suggest that we look closely\r\n\r\nat  the  current programme of personal reliefs  to  determine\r\n\r\nwhere  improvements can be made.  One area which seems to  be\r\n\r\nof concern to a growing number of Singaporeans is the cost of\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment  for their ageing parents.   Perhaps,  the\r\n\r\npersonal  tax  system can be used to help alleviate  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to propose the topping up of\r\n\r\nstudents'  Edusave accounts to encourage  PC  ownership.   We\r\n\r\nwant  to  encourage our students to be more  IT  savvy.   Not\r\n\r\nevery  student can afford a personal computer.   While  there\r\n\r\nare personal computers in schools, the IT\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexposure of the students without personal computers  at  home\r\n\r\nis very much restricted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, IT has increasingly become an integral part of how\r\n\r\nwe  educate  our  next generation, both  during  and  outside\r\n\r\nschool  hours.  In this regard, we should level the  learning\r\n\r\nfield  for our students by giving each and every student  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to widen their learning experience  through  the\r\n\r\nuse of a personal computer. We should make personal computers\r\n\r\nan  essential  part  of the home, as much as  telephones  and\r\n\r\ntelevision  sets are.  For this purpose, I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment consider granting topping up of students'  Edusave\r\n\r\naccounts  to  subsidise or pay for the purchase  of  personal\r\n\r\ncomputers.  The  top-up can be reviewed five years  later  to\r\n\r\nkeep up with the changes in computer technology.  This amount\r\n\r\nin  the  Edusave  account will be for  the  sole  purpose  of\r\n\r\nallowing  students to own a personal computer  at  home  such\r\n\r\nthat  a programme can be put in place by the school to effect\r\n\r\nlearning at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, I cannot help, just like my other\r\n\r\ncolleagues  here,  but notice the glaring  disparity  between\r\n\r\nwhat  was  budgeted last year and the eventual  out-turn.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the  V-shaped  recovery  is  remarkable.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that revenue collection has not fallen  last  year\r\n\r\nand  that  development expenditure intended to stimulate  the\r\n\r\neconomy  is  no longer required. What all this  adds  to,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  that  we  have  over-budgeted  last  year  under\r\n\r\nexceptional  circumstances. But when I cast my eyes  back  to\r\n\r\nthe previous Budget estimates, I wonder if the Government has\r\n\r\ndeveloped  a  trend  of  over-budgeting,  albeit  in  smaller\r\n\r\namounts.   I wonder if the buffer built into previous  Budget\r\n\r\nestimates   could  have  arisen  out  of   a   mentality   of\r\n\r\nconservatism and safety nets.  A conservative mentality  that\r\n\r\nwas,  and  probably  still is commonly  associated  as  being\r\n\r\nsymptomatic of the bureaucraticism in the civil  service.   I\r\n\r\nhope  not.   But  it is a side message emanating  from  over-budgeting.   I  hope not because in order to adequately  meet\r\n\r\nthe  millennium challenges head on, we need both the  private\r\n\r\nand the public sectors to be more rigorous\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  less risk-averse. The Government should lead this change\r\n\r\nto   promote   this   renewal  and  stance  for   Singaporean\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs to factor-risk into their business strategy and\r\n\r\nthe  Government should send the correct messages through this\r\n\r\nbudgeting process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

To\r\n\r\nassist people in this group, the Government will continue  to\r\n\r\ngrant  rebates  on HDB service and conservancy  charges,  and\r\n\r\nrents.   At the same time, they will also enjoy the utilities\r\n\r\nrebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that this kind gesture of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  enable the people of Singapore  to  realise\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government is very caring and is full of humanity.\r\n\r\nI commend the Government for continuing to help this group of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans as our economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister also announced that taxpayers who\r\n\r\nstay  with  their parents and grandparents will enjoy  higher\r\n\r\ntax relief, and the tax relief will be increased by $500,  to\r\n\r\n$5,000.  And also from the Year of Assessment 2001, taxpayers\r\n\r\nwho  top  up  in  cash  to  his  grandparents'  and  parents'\r\n\r\nretirement  accounts  will  be allowed  a  tax  relief.   So,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  the  amount  granted,  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nclearly indicated that it wants to maintain the tradition  of\r\n\r\nfamily  core  values  to deal with our problem  of  an  aging\r\n\r\npopulation.  This rebate will help to promote family cohesion\r\n\r\nand  family  harmony and to encourage maintenance of  parents\r\n\r\nand  grandparents.   The message of the  Government  is  very\r\n\r\nclear and precise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister also announced another scheme, ie,\r\n\r\nour  people  are allowed to contribute voluntarily  over  and\r\n\r\nabove  their  CPF  savings  to the  Supplementary  Retirement\r\n\r\nScheme  with  tax  being payable only when  the  savings  are\r\n\r\nwithdrawn,    and   participants   will   have   considerable\r\n\r\nflexibility  investing  their  savings.   I  think  this   is\r\n\r\nattractive  to  the higher income Singaporeans.   However,  I\r\n\r\nurge  the  Government to also consider giving more favourable\r\n\r\nterms  to Singaporeans who are in the lower and middle income\r\n\r\ngroups,  such  as giving them a higher interest rate,  higher\r\n\r\nthan the bank's interest rate so that those Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  in  the  lower and middle income group who  do  not  pay\r\n\r\nincome  tax would also benefit from this scheme.   This  will\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that  the people in the lower and  middle  income\r\n\r\ngroup will have higher CPF savings in their old age and  this\r\n\r\nwill also help to solve and deal with our problem of an aging\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our economic recovery, the Government has\r\n\r\ndecided  not to grant the 10% income tax rebate as was  given\r\n\r\nlast  year,  but  to  give only 5% rebate  this  year.   Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  disappointed.  They  said  that  with  the\r\n\r\nrecovery  of  the economy, our CPF cut has not been  restored\r\n\r\nand   yet  our  income  tax  rebate  was  reduced  by   half.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   they   had   a  misunderstanding   against   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I  can  understand  their  feelings  and  their\r\n\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since our independence, we have gone\r\n\r\nthrough  four  economic crises and economic  recessions.   We\r\n\r\nhave,  fortunately, been able to weather through this  recent\r\n\r\nAsian  financial crisis.  And under the Government's  prudent\r\n\r\nmanagement,  instead  of a $5 billion  deficit  in  our  1999\r\n\r\nbudget,  we  had actually a $3.2 billion surplus.   This  was\r\n\r\nbecause  our people and the Government have worked   together\r\n\r\nin  one  heart to battle this financial crisis.   However,  I\r\n\r\nfeel that the top up of $250 to our CPF account is good,  but\r\n\r\nnot  enough.  We should commend our people and give them more\r\n\r\npositive  incentive  rewards.  I think the  best  way  is  to\r\n\r\nimmediately  consider restoring their CPF contributions  even\r\n\r\nin  a  gradual  manner.  I feel that at this  moment  we  are\r\n\r\nactually  going  into a period of high economic  growth.   We\r\n\r\nhave emerged from the bicycle era in the 1960s to the F16 era\r\n\r\nnow.    Now   that  our  foreign  reserves  are  steady   and\r\n\r\nincreasing, I think so long as the people and the  Government\r\n\r\ncan  work hand in hand, we would be able to grab hold of this\r\n\r\nopportunity,  and the 21st century will be  a  high  economic\r\n\r\ncentury for Singapore.  I personally feel that we should also\r\n\r\ngradually  restore the CPF to our people so that  people  and\r\n\r\nthe  foreign investors will have  more confidence in  us  and\r\n\r\nthen  our  F16s  will  be  able to perform  better  and  more\r\n\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, the Government reduced the corporate tax to 26%\r\n\r\nand from FY 2001, it will be further reduced by 0.5%, so that\r\n\r\nour  corporate tax will be reduced to 25.5%.  This is a  very\r\n\r\nwise decision.  This will enhance our competitiveness in this\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the competition in the region getting more and more\r\n\r\nintense,  many  developing countries,  in  order  to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  investments,  are reducing  the  corporate  tax  and\r\n\r\ngiving  tax waiver for a certain number of years.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nin  order to maintain our competitiveness, I think we  should\r\n\r\nfurther  perfect  our GST system, ie, to pay  more  when  you\r\n\r\nconsume  more, so when you use less, you pay less.  When  GST\r\n\r\nbecomes our main source of revenue, we should consider\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfurther  reducing  the corporate tax and individual  personal\r\n\r\ntax,  so  that  we  may  attract more foreign  companies  and\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  to  Singapore, and  to  contribute  to  our\r\n\r\neconomic  development so that we would  be  able  to  compete\r\n\r\nactively in the international arena.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the Finance Minister's proposal to\r\n\r\nfurther  improve  the  stock option scheme.   Many  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  have realised that the stock option scheme  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  factor  to retain talents in a company.   And  now\r\n\r\nwith  competition  getting  more and  more  intense  in  this\r\n\r\nregion,  I  think it is very important that  we  be  able  to\r\n\r\nretain  our  team  of talents.  Because the talented  people,\r\n\r\nwhether   they   are   the   CEOs,   scientists,   engineers,\r\n\r\nresearchers, technicians, MBAs or even an ordinary  staff  in\r\n\r\nthe  office, they would rather take the company's shares than\r\n\r\nto  ask  for  high salaries, because they feel that  to  have\r\n\r\nshares in the company will be something that creates a  sense\r\n\r\nof  belonging  to  them.  If the company  makes  money,  they\r\n\r\nshould  get more benefit from it.  Of course, I feel that  we\r\n\r\nshould fix a ceiling as to how much shares they can sell off,\r\n\r\nmaybe  10%  or 20% per year at the most.  And when they  were\r\n\r\ngiven the stock option and at a discount, then of course they\r\n\r\nwould have to pay tax when they sell off the shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is very important in our effort to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  Singapore  as  an  international  securities   and\r\n\r\nfinancial centre.  Only then many foreign high-tech companies\r\n\r\nwill  come  to Singapore for listing.  At the same  time,  it\r\n\r\nwould  also  encourage  our people  to  have  shares  in  the\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I like to mention about is how to\r\n\r\nestablish a more healthy era of creativity.  Apart  from  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure which will be increased  by  21%  and\r\n\r\nour  tax  system  amended  to encourage  people  to  go  into\r\n\r\ncreative  work and to start business, this is something  that\r\n\r\nis  truly  commendable.   I  personally  feel  that  when  we\r\n\r\nencourage  the  people  to go into business,  we  should  not\r\n\r\ncreate  misunderstanding.  We should not let  the  people  go\r\n\r\ninto business impulsively or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nblindly.   They  should  understand what  is  their  ultimate\r\n\r\npurpose of going into business.  We should not encourage them\r\n\r\nto  go  into business like a swarm of bees with the  thinking\r\n\r\nthat  everyone can make money and everyone can be a Sim  Wong\r\n\r\nHoo.   Then  this will be ridiculous.  However, if  they  can\r\n\r\nmake  good money and have great wealth because of the success\r\n\r\nin  their enterprises, then, of course, it is well and  good.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can only see young people going into business with\r\n\r\nthe  objective  of  making more money and  wealth.   This  is\r\n\r\nwrong.  In the next five to 10 years, if we have successfully\r\n\r\ncreated  a  new society, then it will be a very materialistic\r\n\r\nsociety  where everyone just goes for money and greed.   This\r\n\r\nis  not something that we want to see.  Therefore, because of\r\n\r\nthis,  I feel that when we are encouraging the people  to  be\r\n\r\nenterprising,  we should also lead the young  people  in  the\r\n\r\nright   direction.   First  of  all,  they   must   have   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  themselves before  they  create  business.\r\n\r\nThey  must have this human factor.  They must have the talent\r\n\r\nand the wisdom to go into the business.  Of course, nowadays,\r\n\r\nwe  have many young talents.  They have this first condition.\r\n\r\nI think this is something that is beyond doubt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this human factor, we must find out whether\r\n\r\nthe surrounding environment is conducive to their starting  a\r\n\r\nbusiness.   In  this  respect, the Singapore  Government  has\r\n\r\nencouraged people to venture into business and to go regional\r\n\r\nor  global.  The Finance Minister has amended our tax  system\r\n\r\nto  encourage our people to undertake creative  work  and  to\r\n\r\nhave  the entrepreneurial spirit.  This is something that  is\r\n\r\nclear  for everyone of us.  Whether or not they will be  able\r\n\r\nto  raise enough capital to start their own business, this is\r\n\r\nagain  something that the Government should help.  Of course,\r\n\r\nthere  are  lots of venture fund schemes to help  them  solve\r\n\r\nthis  problem of shortage in capital to start their business.\r\n\r\nWith  the human factor and a conducive environment, the  next\r\n\r\nthing is to look for opportunities, ie, the right timing.   I\r\n\r\nthink timing is very important.  It is like when to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproduce  and what type of products to satisfy the demands  of\r\n\r\nthe  consumers.   As  for  products,  whether  designing   or\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, do they really understand the  market  for  it\r\n\r\nand  what will be the competition?  These are things that the\r\n\r\nyoung  people will have to carefully consider before they  go\r\n\r\ninto  business.   So,  when we see these  people  going  into\r\n\r\nbusiness  like  a swarm of bees, I feel that they  are  going\r\n\r\ninto  business  with the belief that by just  setting  a  few\r\n\r\ndot.com  companies, they will become Sim Wong Hoo  in  a  few\r\n\r\nmonths'  time.   This  is very unrealistic  and  very  naive.\r\n\r\nMoney  does  not come so easily.  They do not fall  from  the\r\n\r\nsky.   So,  when the young people go into business,  even  if\r\n\r\nthey  have the aforesaid conditions, they are only  the  pre-requisites.   It  is still a long way before they  can  taste\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I want to say is that if they are\r\n\r\nenterprising just at a moment's impulse, then it will not  be\r\n\r\nsustained  and it will wither away very easily.  The  Silicon\r\n\r\nValley was not established in this way.  Even if you have the\r\n\r\npre-requisites,  it  does not mean you  will  be  successful.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we have to consider all the complicated  problems\r\n\r\nthat  you may encounter after you have started your business,\r\n\r\nwhether you have the will power to fight on, whether you will\r\n\r\ngive  up  half-way, whether you would get up again after  you\r\n\r\nhave  failed.  You must also understand that success  is  the\r\n\r\naccumulation of many failures.  Your dreams are  nothing  but\r\n\r\njust  a  fantasy  in  your  mind,  you  will  never  succeed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  you  will have to know whether  you  have  this\r\n\r\nbusiness acumen, whether you are sensitive about the  market,\r\n\r\nwhen  to  get  in  and when to get out, how to  analyse  your\r\n\r\nbusiness operations, how is your inter-personal relationship.\r\n\r\nThese are all very important factors to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people must understand what is the highest\r\n\r\nobjective  that you should pursue.  A successful entrepreneur\r\n\r\nwill pursue a sense of satisfaction, the achievement in their\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  a  sense of mission and not  just  money.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if you are successful in your business, if you  have\r\n\r\nmoney, so long as you do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwomanise, gamble or not greedy, you will have enough money to\r\n\r\nlive through life.  But a successful entrepreneur goes for  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  satisfaction in the achievement of their  business\r\n\r\nand  a  sense  of  mission  to  the  society.   This  is  the\r\n\r\nintangible  wealth  that  is inexhaustible.   Of  course,  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur will have the imagination, the courage  and  the\r\n\r\nvision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people going into business would of course want\r\n\r\nto  make  money.  But we do not want just to make  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney and pay a lot of taxes.  We have also to return some of\r\n\r\nour  moneys  to society to help those who are less  fortunate\r\n\r\nthan us.  Of course, the pursuit of wealth is not a sin,  but\r\n\r\nwe  must  understand  benevolence and wealth.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nconflict between them.  Only the very rich can exercise great\r\n\r\nbenevolence.  Our forefathers in the business world like  Tan\r\n\r\nKah  Kee and Lee Kong Chian are great entrepreneurs but  they\r\n\r\nhave  contributed a lot in helping our society.  But  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  I can only smell  young people going like a swarm  of\r\n\r\nbees, just to make money.  This is indeed a profound regret.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I must say that in order for Singapore to\r\n\r\nflourish,  we  must  have a very good culture  in  our  civil\r\n\r\nservice.    First  of  all,  I  must  declare  my   interest.\r\n\r\nRecently,  I  invested with a friend on a type of  electronic\r\n\r\nproduct.   It  is something invested by a young  Singaporean.\r\n\r\nIt  is  what we call \"creative cracker\".  It is not the  real\r\n\r\ncracker, no gun powder and no danger.  Once we announced  the\r\n\r\ninvention of these creative crackers, the police told us that\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  sell  them.   We submitted our  application.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's response was very fast.  The Police was helpful.\r\n\r\nBut  when  it went to the Ministry of the Environment,  noise\r\n\r\npollution was not a problem.  It can be accepted.   But  they\r\n\r\nsay  this  creative  cracker will let  out  a  lot  of  paper\r\n\r\nfragments  and  they  will litter the public  areas.   So  it\r\n\r\nbecomes littering.  They pushed the buck and finally it  went\r\n\r\nback to the police.  I feel that if it is just a question  of\r\n\r\nlittering, you can make rules and say you must clean  up  the\r\n\r\npaper  fragments.  Why  must you push away  such  a  creative\r\n\r\ninvention?  Finally, it just died a natural death.  This is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  an  environment in which the Government  is  encouraging\r\n\r\ncreative   enterprise.   Many  of  our  civil  servants   are\r\n\r\ninflexible.  When the rules say you cannot do this,  then  of\r\n\r\ncourse you cannot do it.  When there are no rules to say  you\r\n\r\ncannot do, yet you are not allowed to do it.  I hope that our\r\n\r\ncivil servants would not just say, if there is no U-turn, you\r\n\r\ncannot  turn.  Only if there is a U-turn sign, then  you  can\r\n\r\nmake  a U-turn.  But if there is no U-turn sign, think  about\r\n\r\nit.  Do not do a U-turn but turn into a side road, make a  3-point turn and go on.  This is creative!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recently announced the setting up of\r\n\r\nEnterprise Challenge Trophy started by Dr Tan Chin Nam.  They\r\n\r\nwant to introduce this sort of creative spirit of the Silicon\r\n\r\nValley into our public service departments. We encourage  our\r\n\r\npublic  servants to keep on coming out with new ideas and  to\r\n\r\ncultivate  our civil service with this concept of creativity.\r\n\r\nOnly  then  can  we establish a very creative entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget Statement by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, seems notable to  me\r\n\r\nfor at least three reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it officially marks the turn around that our\r\n\r\neconomy  has made in this past year.  It is a marker  in  the\r\n\r\nchange of mood from the doom and gloom of last year, and  the\r\n\r\nfresh hopes of a new year and millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the statement recognises how much our continued\r\n\r\nrecovery   depends  on  the  region  and  the  wider   world.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  open economy can be buoyed or  brought  down  by\r\n\r\nevents  in the USA, Japan, Indonesia and other parts  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the statement is a budget that seeks to deal with\r\n\r\nthe effects of globalisation.  The phenomena of globalisation\r\n\r\nincrease  competition  between  companies  and  nations.   It\r\n\r\ncreates  great opportunities for some, with the right  skills\r\n\r\nat  the right price.  For others, without such skills, it can\r\n\r\nmean  the  end  of existing jobs and the start of  persisting\r\n\r\npockets of unemployment or of persistently low wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many economic indicators and some stock markets have\r\n\r\nshown  marked  improvement since the third quarter  of  1999.\r\n\r\nSome  believe the crisis is over.  I think that this  is  not\r\n\r\nthe right way to look at things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe instead that we are going to enter a period in\r\n\r\nwhich  crisis  may recur.  These may be similar  to  what  we\r\n\r\nexperienced in 1997, or from a wholly new nature and  source.\r\n\r\nThere is little guarantee that the long decades of rapid  and\r\n\r\nlargely  uninterrupted growth that we and much  of  the  East\r\n\r\nAsian region knew until the crisis will again return, whether\r\n\r\nfor  us  or  for our neighbours.  It is likely that  we  will\r\n\r\ninstead  experience a much more patchy pattern.   Some  years\r\n\r\nwill  be  better  than  others.  Some  countries  will  surge\r\n\r\nforward  while  others  in  the region  will  struggle.  Some\r\n\r\nsectors  of  our economy and society will prosper and  others\r\n\r\nmay experience a slow down or even extinction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the Budget of 2000 is not simply a budget for\r\n\r\nthe  new financial year.  It may in fact be seen as a  Budget\r\n\r\nfor  a  new  era.   This is a post-crisis era  in  which  new\r\n\r\nstresses from worldwide competition and globalisation must be\r\n\r\naddressed. This is an era in which the recovery would be real\r\n\r\nfor  some,  uncertain  for  others,  and  a  missed  boat  of\r\n\r\nopportunity for yet others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much depends on the policies that we adopt. The\r\n\r\nimportant  policies, moreover, are not just on macro-economic\r\n\r\nand financial matters.  They relate to technology, education,\r\n\r\ncitizenship and foreign talent, rules and social  norms  that\r\n\r\nallow  and reward risk-taking as well as to community, family\r\n\r\nand good relations with others in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, there are special needs for financial and other\r\n\r\npolicies  that  allow  and encourage the new  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy to flourish here in Singapore.  Yet, there is also  a\r\n\r\nneed  for  measures that reaffirm many important and enduring\r\n\r\nfoundations of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this setting, there are many points we must consider.\r\n\r\nI can only touch on some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof these. Some relate to the general context the Minister has\r\n\r\nset  out.  Others relate more specifically to strategies that\r\n\r\ncan be suggested to deal with the challenges of this new era.\r\n\r\nI  shall deal first with the regional setting, and then  with\r\n\r\npolicies for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore, ASEAN and the World Economy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at ASEAN and the world economy, we must see\r\n\r\nthat  we have generally enjoyed a special place in the  world\r\n\r\neconomy,  as have others in the region.  They have attracted,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  China,  the lion's share  of  foreign  direct\r\n\r\ninvestment  that  goes to the developing  countries.   Asia's\r\n\r\ntrade,  up to the crisis, had been the fastest rate of growth\r\n\r\nin  the  world.  In contrast, many countries in Latin America\r\n\r\nand  Africa have known years, decades, of slow or no  growth.\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries, with some exceptions, have been  relatively\r\n\r\nopen  to  the  world economy.  Singapore is  the  most  fully\r\n\r\nintegrated and open of all.  Openness has, to date, been part\r\n\r\nof our formula for success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Hu is right, therefore, in pointing to both the\r\n\r\ndevelopments in the world that favour our continued recovery,\r\n\r\nand  other  events  that  may  de-rail  that  recovery.  With\r\n\r\nopenness comes both opportunity and vulnerability.  If others\r\n\r\ndo  well, we are most likely to prosper.  If others fail  and\r\n\r\nflounder, we may well be affected.  This is the nature of the\r\n\r\nopen and inter-dependent world economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Hu has pointed out some of the major trends,\r\n\r\nboth  the upswings and possible downsides.  May I ask him  to\r\n\r\nadditionally consider three factors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors are (1) the need to renew our regionalism;\r\n\r\n(2)  the  prospect  of  increasing economic  cooperation  and\r\n\r\nintegration in ASEAN and East Asia; and (3) the rising  price\r\n\r\nof oil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his Budget Statement, Dr Hu recognised the\r\n\r\nrising  competition  with  China.  He  also  recognised  that\r\n\r\nChina's rise is not all negative for us all.  There are  also\r\n\r\nopportunities if we find ways to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomplement  investments and growth there.  The Minister  also\r\n\r\nspoke  of problems in neighbouring countries and the relative\r\n\r\nstrength of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, may I draw him out on how the Budget\r\n\r\nmight  set  the  context  for  a  renewed  wave  of  regional\r\n\r\nundertakings  in  China and elsewhere?  I ask  this  question\r\n\r\nparticularly  in the light of our experience  in  the  Suzhou\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Park,  and  of  the  financial   and   political\r\n\r\nfluctuations in other countries during this crisis.  What new\r\n\r\nways,  if  any,  does  the Government propose  to  complement\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  growth  overseas so  that  Singapore  might\r\n\r\nbenefit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister if it is time that we provided\r\n\r\nbetter  schemes for our businessmen to consolidate and  write\r\n\r\noff  losses from their overseas ventures.  Or even  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nlower  tax  on profits they may remit from overseas ventures,\r\n\r\nwhen they return these profits back to Singapore's economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all that has happened in the crisis generally and\r\n\r\nin  Suzhou  particularly, we must recognise that  going  into\r\n\r\nChina  and other countries is subject to risk.  Yet, we  also\r\n\r\nrecognise  that these risks must be taken, if our economy  is\r\n\r\nto  go regional, global and help sustain growth in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  may  therefore be a strategic step forward for the Budget\r\n\r\nto  provide  greater financial incentive for such  risks  and\r\n\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some who heeded the Government's call to\r\n\r\nregionalise  have  been badly hit by the crisis.   We  should\r\n\r\nassist  them to renew their commitment to going regional  and\r\n\r\nglobal.  New incentives would set the right signal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to my second point on economic cooperation\r\n\r\nand  integration in ASEAN and East Asia.  Sir, the Minister's\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement  recognises the  importance  of  China  and\r\n\r\nJapan.  Additionally, we can and should make more  ties  with\r\n\r\nour  fellow ASEAN economies, to increase economic cooperation\r\n\r\nand integration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the crisis, positive steps have been taken. A\r\n\r\nsystem  of  financial surveillance over ASEAN and East  Asian\r\n\r\neconomies  has begun.  There may be  a temptation to  slacken\r\n\r\nnow  the worst of the crisis seems over.  Yet, such a  system\r\n\r\nmust be continued, the vital alarm bell to signal that danger\r\n\r\nof any recurrence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other positive steps forward taken despite the crisis\r\n\r\nhave  been  in  the  ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)  and  ASEAN\r\n\r\ninvestment Area (AIA).  While these steps have been promised,\r\n\r\nthere  seem to be some negative trends.  Countries  that  are\r\n\r\nnewer  to ASEAN and the world economy and free market system,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, may well  have\r\n\r\ndoubts about opening up their economies.  These concerns  are\r\n\r\noften not confined to economic matters.  They also relate  to\r\n\r\nsocial, cultural and political factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I would ask the Finance Minister and\r\n\r\nhis  colleagues  in  Government to  do  more  to  assist  our\r\n\r\nneighbours  in  making the necessary but  sometimes  daunting\r\n\r\ntransitions for these countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is both an open economy and one of the most\r\n\r\ndeveloped  ones  in the region.  We can and should  do  more.\r\n\r\nThis should not be as a bandage or charity, but to help build\r\n\r\nthe  expertise, capacity, infrastructure, and for  us  to  be\r\n\r\ntrue  partners with our neighbours.  This is as much for  our\r\n\r\ngood  in  the longer term, as for theirs.  It would encourage\r\n\r\nand  enable  neighbouring countries to  undertake  the  right\r\n\r\npolicy  reforms  and allow the AFTA and AIA to  proceed  more\r\n\r\nsmoothly and quickly.  I will speak more on this matter  when\r\n\r\nwe come to the estimates of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One related and further question, which is directly\r\n\r\nunder  the  Minister for Finance's purview,  is  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  consider  more generous  tax  exemptions  for\r\n\r\nfoundations  and institutions in Singapore who  undertake  or\r\n\r\nfund development and training projects abroad, in other ASEAN\r\n\r\nand  Asian  countries.  Our private sector and civil  society\r\n\r\ncan play a significant role in helping our neighbouring\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountries.   This  can  be in small but significant  projects\r\n\r\nsuch as the provision of medical care in Bintan, or assisting\r\n\r\nenvironmental groups in Indonesia.  Tax exemptions  for  such\r\n\r\nworthwhile overseas projects would encourage such good  works\r\n\r\nand  better recognise the growing interdependence between our\r\n\r\nsociety and those of our neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask the Finance Minister to play his part\r\n\r\nin  continuing  and strengthening the new  ASEAN  system  for\r\n\r\nfinancial surveillance.  Indeed, we might ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nlook   forward  to  a  greater  system  of  cooperation   and\r\n\r\ncoordination for financial and economic matters in ASEAN  and\r\n\r\nEast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might also hope that the Government will proceed with\r\n\r\nmore bilateral agreements on free trade, investment, taxation\r\n\r\nand  associated matters.  Singapore is presently  studying  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of these, including those with New Zealand and Japan.\r\n\r\nWith our ASEAN partners, we are also considering an agreement\r\n\r\nbetween ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand.  We should  do  all\r\n\r\nwe  can  to  proceed with these with due dispatch.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  given that talks in the World Trade  Organisation\r\n\r\nhave stalled.  Perhaps other regional agreements too might be\r\n\r\nusefully explored, such as one with China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to my third point on the overall context.\r\n\r\nThis is on rising oil prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is observable that there has been a sharp rise\r\n\r\nin  oil  prices.  This may mark a reversal in the low  prices\r\n\r\nthat  the  world  has  known in these past  years.   We  will\r\n\r\nremember  how oil prices hiked up by the OPEC cartel  in  the\r\n\r\n1970s  caused  many  economies  to  slow  and  stall.    This\r\n\r\nparticularly affected economies such as ours which are highly\r\n\r\ndependent on energy, and yet have little or (in our case)  no\r\n\r\nenergy resources.  May I ask the Minister how he thinks  this\r\n\r\ntrend  may affect our recovery, and what we might do to  meet\r\n\r\nthis possibility, as best we can?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself believe that much more can and should be done\r\n\r\nto encourage greater\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenergy efficiency in Singapore.  I will return to this  point\r\n\r\nwhen  I outline my thoughts on the national economy.  But  at\r\n\r\nthis juncture, I do wish to emphasise that my call for energy\r\n\r\nefficiency  is  not,  in  this  sense,  premised  solely   on\r\n\r\nenvironmental  and ethical concerns, that I often  raised  in\r\n\r\nthis   House.   Energy  efficiency,  like  other   forms   of\r\n\r\nefficiency, is primarily a concern about our competitiveness.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a way to enhance our economic security against sudden\r\n\r\nshocks and rising energy prices that seem to be on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Singapore Economy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thus far, I have spoken about the place of\r\n\r\nSingapore and our region in the world economy.  Now, allow me\r\n\r\nto  turn  to  the place of all Singaporeans in  our  national\r\n\r\nsetting.   In  doing so, I will touch on three  points.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  whether we can keep the compact of  1999;  second,\r\n\r\nwhether  we  can  provide opportunities for all  in  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy;   and,  third,  of  increasing  the  efficiency   of\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first point, the crisis saw the ouster of\r\n\r\nleaders  in  some countries and, in others, the  betrayal  of\r\n\r\ntrust  that  people gave to their governments.  The  role  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's Government in this context is very difficult.  We\r\n\r\nweathered the crisis and the Government led our recovery, and\r\n\r\npeople  should  acknowledge the role of the  Government  with\r\n\r\ngratitude.  Singaporeans have a strong and resilient  spirit,\r\n\r\nbut   good  governance  and  leadership  have  been   greatly\r\n\r\nimportant for our recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, while the Government has done well, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  some further explanation of the Budget Statement  is\r\n\r\nimportant.  Some may otherwise wonder if the compact  between\r\n\r\nthe  Government and people in facing the crisis of  1999  has\r\n\r\nbeen met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relates to two facts. First, that the Government\r\n\r\nwas  supposed to go into deficit, but did not.  Second,  that\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  cut  is not yet fully reinstated, yet senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants and Government leaders will have their full pay  put\r\n\r\nback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In asking for further explanations, we should\r\n\r\nacknowledge that citizens were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nasked to make a sacrifice in their pay, and did, and this was\r\n\r\nreal.  In contrast, the Minister announced a surplus, instead\r\n\r\nof a deficit.  This reversed a projected $5.1 billion deficit\r\n\r\ninto  a surplus of $3.2 billion.  This is a variance of  some\r\n\r\n$8.3 billion in total.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his statement, the Minister explained that, in part,\r\n\r\nthis  happy  state  of affairs was due to  lower  development\r\n\r\nproject  spending,  and the rescheduling  of  some  projects.\r\n\r\nThis  may  seem prudent to some.  However, the state  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy   depends  on  a  mix  of  both  public  and  private\r\n\r\nconsumption.   A  fall in Government spending  may  therefore\r\n\r\ncreate  a  surplus,  but  at the cost  of  lessening  overall\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I note that the Minister acknowledged\r\n\r\nthat  the  construction  sector remained  in  recession,  and\r\n\r\nremains  so today.  In 1999, this sector contracted a  severe\r\n\r\n12%,  according to the Minister's statement.  May I  ask  him\r\n\r\nwhether,  if  the Government has not held back its  projects,\r\n\r\npart  of  this  contraction might have been avoided  and  the\r\n\r\nconstruction sector helped?  What were the main or main types\r\n\r\nof  projects  that  were  held back by  Government?   Equally\r\n\r\nimportant,  how  will the unexpected surplus  be  used?   The\r\n\r\nMinister  announced various schemes that add up to some  $685\r\n\r\nmillion, but this is well short of the full surplus  of  $3.2\r\n\r\nbillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me, therefore, to propose a way of spending some\r\n\r\nof the Minister's money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation, as I have mentioned briefly, will\r\n\r\nincrease  the  divisions between sectors  in  our  societies.\r\n\r\nSome  sectors  will  prosper  and  others  may  experience  a\r\n\r\nslowdown.   Those with little formal training  and  education\r\n\r\nhave  less  chance to participate and benefit  from  the  new\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.  This may strain our social cohesion\r\n\r\nand  the  Singaporean ideal that all must have  a  chance  to\r\n\r\nprosper.  We should do all we can to increase the capacity of\r\n\r\neveryone  to  participate.   If not,  we  are  in  danger  of\r\n\r\nbreeding resentment and our own tribe of Luddites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Luddites, if you recall, was a movement in the early\r\n\r\n19th century that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprotested against new technology by rioting and breaking  the\r\n\r\nnew  machines.   The  use of violence  must,  of  course,  be\r\n\r\ncondemned.  But what we have to understand today is that  the\r\n\r\nLuddites  did  not wreck machines for no purpose  or  because\r\n\r\nthey  were  against progress.  In most cases, it was  because\r\n\r\nthey  were displaced by machines and given no chance to  join\r\n\r\nin  the  benefits  of the progress.  We must,  therefore,  be\r\n\r\ninclusive  in promoting progress.  Thus, while some  sectors,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  younger graduates and professionals or even foreign\r\n\r\ntalents, may have advantages in the KBE, we must act so  that\r\n\r\nno  sector is completely excluded.  Worker retraining,  which\r\n\r\nthe Government initiated, is part of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I believe we would benefit from greater attempts to\r\n\r\nbring  IT  and  other new skills to the mass of  people.   We\r\n\r\nshould  in this recognise that Government cannot provide  for\r\n\r\neveryone.  I therefore ask the Government to consider  giving\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans  a new fund for their own self-improvement.\r\n\r\nThis  would  be open to a wide range of courses in  different\r\n\r\nskills.   This  could  range  from  Masters  courses  at  the\r\n\r\nuniversity to language instruction or to computer  skills  or\r\n\r\nbasic   education.   Such  educational  schemes   should   be\r\n\r\nrecognised  as  creating assets, just as much (if  not  more)\r\n\r\nthan  buying a house with your CPF money or upgrading  flats.\r\n\r\nThis  would  be  a  fitting use for the  surpluses  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has unexpectedly generated in 1999.  Perhaps  this\r\n\r\nnew fund might be called \"EdVenture\", as it is like a venture\r\n\r\ncapital for education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to close, Mr Speaker, by looking at the forward\r\n\r\nprojections for the coming year.  One item that stands out to\r\n\r\nme  is the operating revenue of Government.  This will go  up\r\n\r\nby  some 8.6%.  In particular, I note that manpower estimates\r\n\r\nwill  increase by some 10.8%.  That is to say, Government  is\r\n\r\ncosting us more, and civil servants are costing us more.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  good  governments do not come cheap.  But  expensive\r\n\r\nthings  are not always better.  Most Singaporeans like  their\r\n\r\nstuff cheap but good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in operating revenues and in manpower\r\n\r\ncosts are notable in that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey outstrip economic growth for 1999, which was 5.4%.  They\r\n\r\nare  also  larger than the Government's forecasts  for  2000,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  between  4.5  and 6.5%.   Should  these  types  of\r\n\r\nexpenses  grow  faster than our economy?  Or should  they  be\r\n\r\npegged and made sustainable?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my point that we must reduce Government costs\r\n\r\nat  all  costs.  What I am suggesting is that we  should  set\r\n\r\nourselves  the challenge of doing more with less -  having  a\r\n\r\ngood government, making good government better, but for less.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  am asking the Government to try to do more with  less\r\n\r\nmoney,  people and resources of land, water, and energy.   To\r\n\r\ndo  so,  Government should aim to be competitive, transparent\r\n\r\nand  efficient.   This is for all resources,  but  especially\r\n\r\nthose which Singapore has in short supply, such as energy and\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at this juncture return to my concern about\r\n\r\nenergy  efficiency as an illustration of this broader  point.\r\n\r\nAs  I said earlier, oil prices have risen and may well remain\r\n\r\nhigh, or go higher.  Government and businesses can always  do\r\n\r\nnothing more than just pass on these new and higher costs  to\r\n\r\ntheir   consumers  and  taxpayers.   Or,  and  this  is   the\r\n\r\nalternative, they can seek to be more efficient in their use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be done by incentives in our Budget for the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  Energy efficiency can also be  mandated  by\r\n\r\nnew  regulations with higher standards.  Such  measures  need\r\n\r\nnot  be  at  the forefront of technology and risk undermining\r\n\r\nour  competitiveness.   But they can be usefully  benchmarked\r\n\r\nagainst  what  other  countries with  good  records  achieve.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, and perhaps most importantly, Government itself\r\n\r\ncan set the tone for energy and other efficiencies in its own\r\n\r\npractices and principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would hope that the Government will\r\n\r\nsee   fit  to  release  all  or  part  of  its  own  internal\r\n\r\ninteragency report on energy efficiency.  At the last sitting\r\n\r\nof Parliament, the Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSecretary  in  the  Ministry of National Development,  Assoc.\r\n\r\nProf.  Koo  Tsai  Kee, said they might do so,  under  certain\r\n\r\nconditions and subject to certain caveats that he did not  or\r\n\r\ncould  not  specify.  I would ask the Government to  consider\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  greater transparency and leadership  in  this\r\n\r\nimportant arena of efficiency and competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a critical aspect of good governance. Not just\r\n\r\nas  it  relates to the specific example of energy efficiency,\r\n\r\nbut in all aspects of Government policy making.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will take up and develop some of the points in my\r\n\r\ncuts on the estimates for the various Ministries.  I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister will consider and respond to the points that I  have\r\n\r\nmade here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayere-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.  I  am\r\n\r\nmuch obliged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Nominated MP, Mr Noris Ong, said that it has\r\n\r\nbecome  common practice to use a single word to describe  the\r\n\r\nbudgets  in  recent years.  He used Millennium Budget,  Cyber\r\n\r\nBudget, Withdrawal Budget, and many other words.  If  I  were\r\n\r\nto  follow  that,  I  would call this year's  budget  an  \"e-Budget\".   Delivering the millennium's first  budget,  Dr  Hu\r\n\r\nsignalled  the  entry of Singapore in the world's  burgeoning\r\n\r\nknowledge  economy.   I use the alphabet   \"e\"  not  to  just\r\n\r\ndescribe  the new Internet economy, but rather I use  \"e\"  as\r\n\r\nthe  first alphabet of some of the key points that Dr Hu  has\r\n\r\nraised  in his Budget Statement and the tax changes  that  he\r\n\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, e-Budget for economic recovery. This Budget\r\n\r\nsignals our region's economic recovery.  That was the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  many  found that the Santa Claus, Dr Richard Hu's  gift-sack  was much lighter relative to last year.  This has  even\r\n\r\nled to some people to dismiss the Budget, very unfairly in my\r\n\r\nopinion, as a non-event.  Dr Hu, in his statement, emphasised\r\n\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngiven  the  favourable  external environment,  and  I  quote:\r\n\r\n\"Unless  we are among the world's best, we will be  relegated\r\n\r\nto  playing  a  peripheral role in the global economy\".   And\r\n\r\nthis could be achieved through an educated and highly skilled\r\n\r\nworkforce augmented by external (\"e\" for external) or foreign\r\n\r\ntalent,  promoting  technoprise  or  technopreneurs,  and  by\r\n\r\nthrowing  open  our  financial services, communications,  and\r\n\r\npower sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2000 commentators, like Price Waterhouse Coopers,\r\n\r\nfeel  that  there is not much tax incentive for skilling  our\r\n\r\nworkforce and the job has been left very much to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Manpower.   They  and  others  who  feel  that  way  must\r\n\r\nrecognise  that Manpower 21 was just launched late last  year\r\n\r\nand  that  MOM's development expenditure has increased  by  a\r\n\r\nwhooping  684% from $7 million last year to $52 million  this\r\n\r\nyear.   But  I  agree  that  the  skilling  needs  much  more\r\n\r\nfinancing beyond the $52 million and much more attention from\r\n\r\nall quarters of Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the many more \"e\"s of this Budget\r\n\r\n2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-budget for Government expenditure. Sir, the Budget\r\n\r\nbook  says  that this expenditure will increase by  12.5%  to\r\n\r\nnearly $29 billion this year.  Whereas the Nominated MP Noris\r\n\r\nOng, and I think Mr Simon Tay as well, pointed out that  when\r\n\r\nthe  year  is out, this 12.5% increase would really be  spent\r\n\r\nand not seen as surpluses in the following year.  I hope that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will make up for the less  expenditure  last\r\n\r\nyear    by   meeting   this   target   of   12.5%   increase.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship  has been given more boost  through  various\r\n\r\nincentives,  particularly for non-manufacturing  sectors  and\r\n\r\nfor  foreigners  who carry out their work in Singapore.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the employee stock options scheme (ESOP).   Changes\r\n\r\nhave  been announced and I welcome the Government's  move  in\r\n\r\nthis  much  awaited direction to reduce taxes  for  employees\r\n\r\nwhen  they  exercise  their options.  This  would  help  both\r\n\r\nbudding high-tech start-ups and established companies attract\r\n\r\nand retain both local\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   foreign  talent.   Along  with  this,  employer's   CPF\r\n\r\nrestoration  of another 2% is a welcome gesture though  there\r\n\r\nwas  greater public expectation for restoration of  a  higher\r\n\r\npercentage, despite DPM Lee's earlier announcement about  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's schedule of CPF restoration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-budget for estate duty - the exemption for residential\r\n\r\nproperties    will   certainly   facilitate   many    budding\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to work from their home, as  many  do  in  the\r\n\r\ngarages of their homes in the United States and Europe.  Sir,\r\n\r\nsome MPs who have spoken earlier had said that Government has\r\n\r\nnot announced too many incentives for entrepreneurs.  Against\r\n\r\nthe  background  of $1 billion that has been  set  aside  for\r\n\r\npromoting  technopreneurship, many have  expectation  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment doing more for the entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an entrepreneurship is an entrepreneur if he finds\r\n\r\nhis  way given the facilities that the Government can provide\r\n\r\nand  the environment that the Government can provide  is  for\r\n\r\nthe  entrepreneur to see a way through to make his  money  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  his  business.   Sir,  the  best  definition  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneur is perhaps given by one American magazine that I\r\n\r\nread  many  years ago, and they talked about the logo  of  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  association in America where  it  had  a  stone\r\n\r\nsculpture  where  a male's body up to his waist  was  already\r\n\r\nsculptured  and he was leaning forward with a  hammer  and  a\r\n\r\nchisel, trying to carve his own legs and putting himself into\r\n\r\nshape.   That  is  how  perhaps  an  entrepreneur  should  be\r\n\r\nevolved.  He does not know what is ahead but he is constantly\r\n\r\nevolving  and  trying to make use of the  environment  before\r\n\r\nhim.    And   the   Government's  job  is  to  provide   that\r\n\r\nenvironment, not to do everything for the entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, I am happy to see the changes that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has made so far and it must continue to  open\r\n\r\nup  the facilities so that more entrepreneurs can surface  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move on to a few other \"e\"s that\r\n\r\nrelate to society and education.  Education of the young has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindeed  received  a significant boost.  The  operational  and\r\n\r\ndevelopmental  expenditure for the Ministry of  Education  is\r\n\r\nsignificantly higher at 15% and 22% respectively,  signalling\r\n\r\nour  commitment  to prepare our school-going children  for  a\r\n\r\nknowledge economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"E\" for elders or senior citizens. Senior citizens will\r\n\r\nbenefit   through  this  CPF  top-up  and  through  the   new\r\n\r\nSupplementary Retirement Scheme which appears good in concept\r\n\r\nto  prepare Singapore for a rapidly aging population.  But as\r\n\r\nNominated  MP Noris Ong pointed out, there are  a  number  of\r\n\r\nissues there and we would have to wait and see how this  will\r\n\r\nbe implemented and its full tax implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"E\" for extended families. Extended families will\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  increased  income tax  concessions  for  their\r\n\r\ndependants who are their aged parents.  Let us hope that this\r\n\r\nwill  be  one  of  the additional factors in  increasing  the\r\n\r\nnumber of extended families in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, almost everyone has something to gain from\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Budget.   My  congratulations  to  Dr  Hu   for\r\n\r\ndelivering not an exceptional or excellent Budget this  year,\r\n\r\nbut an efficient Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I would like to move on to talk briefly about\r\n\r\nthe advent of the new global knowledge economy and its impact\r\n\r\nglobally and locally, and the role of our Government in  this\r\n\r\nregard.  The Internet economy is rapidly changing the way  of\r\n\r\nlife  for  people the world over.  New developments  are  not\r\n\r\nonly happening every day but every morning and afternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Internet economy, through the equity, money and\r\n\r\ndebt markets, has been the catalyst in the redistribution  of\r\n\r\nwealth  of  legendary proportions.  Let me relate a  folklore\r\n\r\nthat  is familiar to all of us here:  Robin Hood and his band\r\n\r\nof  merry men stole from the rich to feed the poor.  Over the\r\n\r\ncenturies of retelling, the Robin Hood legend grew:  peerless\r\n\r\narcher, noble fighter against injustice and tyranny, champion\r\n\r\nof the little guy.  A hero.  Thanks\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the Internet revolution, we cosmopolitans live in a Robin\r\n\r\nHood  economy, where redistribution of wealth in  significant\r\n\r\nproportions  is taking place.  It is not so much robbing  the\r\n\r\nrich  to pay the poor, but it is not far off.  And, irony  of\r\n\r\nironies,  it  is  the money men, the venture capitalists  who\r\n\r\nplay Robin Hood.  Sir, I want to say that I am an advisor  to\r\n\r\none  of  these venture capital firms and declare my interest,\r\n\r\nif  any.   And  the twist is that in the Robin Hood  economy,\r\n\r\neverybody who is involved wins, at least thus far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globally, North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and\r\n\r\nSouth  America are the key continents that are  very  quickly\r\n\r\nadapting  themselves to the new Internet world.  But  let  us\r\n\r\nask   ourselves  where  Africa  features  in  this  new  era.\r\n\r\nAlready,  Africa is far behind the rest of the world  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  age.  Will Africa become a victim of the  digital\r\n\r\ndivide  and  become  a digital outcast?   Or  will  there  be\r\n\r\nresources and the political will amongst the African leaders,\r\n\r\nto  change this sad state of affairs?  One distinct advantage\r\n\r\nif the above problems can be resolved, is that the absence of\r\n\r\nlegacy  systems would help Africa leapfrog into the  Internet\r\n\r\ntechnologies  faster.   But  at  this  moment,  I   am   very\r\n\r\nsceptical.  This is something that the world leaders have  to\r\n\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zooming back to Singapore, very many of our\r\n\r\ncosmopolitans  and  our young are the  immediate  and  future\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries of this wonderful new money world, and the  new\r\n\r\ntechnology  infrastructure.  And many  of  us  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  just link the many dot.com companies  to  the\r\n\r\nequity market and we say that this Internet economy is  going\r\n\r\nto burst.  I like to just use this example that BG George Yeo\r\n\r\nhad used, some years ago, when he talked about pornography on\r\n\r\nthe   Internet.   He  said  that  we  should  keep  the  main\r\n\r\npornographic  sites out of the main streets  and  if  someone\r\n\r\ndoes  go  through the alleys and the lorongs and  get  there,\r\n\r\nwell, we cannot help it the way technology is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me follow on his analogy and just make this point on\r\n\r\nhow  this Internet economy is going to move.  Suppose we were\r\n\r\nin the age when Raffles founded\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore in 1819, or thereabout, when Singapore was  just  a\r\n\r\nfishing  village,  and suppose there was  no  PWD,  no  state\r\n\r\nagency  to  build roads, and if everyone who had  his  little\r\n\r\nkampong  hut,  had to decide to put a road in  front  of  his\r\n\r\nhouse,  and some of us did more extensively and succeeded  in\r\n\r\nattracting more users to the road in front of us, and we  did\r\n\r\nit  together with others, then we will have some  roads  that\r\n\r\nwould  become Orchard Road, others would become Shenton  Way,\r\n\r\nand some others who might not have been more successful might\r\n\r\nbecome the small lorongs, others might do it wrongly,  or  in\r\n\r\ntheir  minds, might do it for different reasons, might become\r\n\r\nthe  Desker  Road.  But whatever the case, as more  and  more\r\n\r\npeople  use  a  particular road, it is going to  become  more\r\n\r\nimportant  and  the  infrastructure around  it  is  going  to\r\n\r\ndevelop.   And that is what the technology infrastructure  is\r\n\r\nall  about.   As  more and more companies go into  this,  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure is going to be there.  But when we link it  to\r\n\r\nthe  equity  markets, it is a different  phenomenon.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  nobody  can  foretell.   But  the   Internet\r\n\r\ntechnology infrastructure is here to stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the MPs from the private sector, who spoke\r\n\r\nearlier,  spoke at length about what Singapore should  do  to\r\n\r\nmove towards this direction.  Personally, I think we are  one\r\n\r\nof  the  few countries in the world where the Government  has\r\n\r\nproactively done so many things to move us to, what we  call,\r\n\r\nthe  KBE.   And one of the MPs who spoke earlier  said  that,\r\n\r\nalthough  Hong Kong had started later than us, we are  behind\r\n\r\nbecause  of this SingTel-C&W HKT deal.  I think the deal  did\r\n\r\nnot come true for different reasons, and it has nothing to do\r\n\r\nwith  whether they were faster or working at Internet  speed.\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is  much more complicated  than  that.   To  be\r\n\r\naccurate,  some  of us who went on a Parliamentary  visit  to\r\n\r\nHong  Kong last year found that Hong Kong had started  almost\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  as  we did.  And Hong Kong  is  a  different\r\n\r\nenvironment.   They have entrepreneurs for  more  than  20-30\r\n\r\nyears and an entrepreneur culture which we are just starting.\r\n\r\nBut  coming back, many MPs here, with the exception of a  few\r\n\r\nlike Mr Simon Tay, had said that we should not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njust  focus  on the business world.  Yes, we have to  succeed\r\n\r\neconomically.   But I think we have to be  inclusive  of  the\r\n\r\nsociety at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I sat here on 25th February to listen attentively\r\n\r\nto  Dr Richard Hu's pronouncements on the economic challenges\r\n\r\nand  opportunities that we face in this Internet world, I was\r\n\r\nsomewhat  saddened that the important aspect  of  the  social\r\n\r\ndimension  of  the digital divide was not being addressed  in\r\n\r\nhis  fiscal policy statement.  Perhaps, I thought it may  not\r\n\r\nneed  some  fiscal treatment at this point of time.   I  told\r\n\r\nmyself  that perhaps it would be the key point that  I  would\r\n\r\nraise  in  this  debate.  I was however pleasantly  surprised\r\n\r\nwhen  MCIT  announced a few days ago that IDA  will  get  $20\r\n\r\nmillion  to  address the digital divide issue  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir, I think it is a very good start, but much more needs  to\r\n\r\nbe done, and not just in terms of money.  Let me elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, the SBA has under its wings the National\r\n\r\nInternet Advisory Committee (NIAC) (in both I sit as a member\r\n\r\nof the board and committee).  The SBA and NIAC promote, among\r\n\r\nother  areas,  the  use  of Internet for  housewives,  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens and non-working people, young, school-going children\r\n\r\nas well. It has set up Project I-Senior and the Family Access\r\n\r\nNetwork  led  by  Mrs Carmee Lim, retired RGS Principal,  and\r\n\r\nthis  has gone on for about two years.  This pioneer work,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say, is excellent, very commendable and has tremendous\r\n\r\nchallenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, I estimate that the bottom 20% of the\r\n\r\npopulation  can be regarded as relatively poor.  My  fear  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  digital  age  may  increase  and  accentuate  this\r\n\r\npercentage and the number as our population grows.   This  is\r\n\r\ncompounded by two factors: a rapidly ageing population and  a\r\n\r\nhigher  computer illiteracy amongst those who are  above  the\r\n\r\nage of 45 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I want to make is this. Singapore is\r\n\r\nknown internationally as the first country in the world to be\r\n\r\nbroadband networked completely.  There are sufficient\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolitical, social and economic reasons why we need to prevent\r\n\r\na  digital divide in Singapore.  Can we also become the first\r\n\r\ncountry  in  the world whose population is entirely  Internet\r\n\r\nready?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To underscore the importance of computer education for\r\n\r\nadults  and senior citizens, I wish to ask the Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  setting up a Ministerial Committee  with  a  social\r\n\r\nfocus that can coordinate a national drive in this direction.\r\n\r\nProviding  money or computers is but only a first  step.  The\r\n\r\nhuman  psyche,  the  apprehension,  the  fear  for  computers\r\n\r\namongst the older Singaporeans need much more attention.   To\r\n\r\nsupport  this effort, a new multi-agency can be set up  under\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister's Office to achieve the same.  Sir, I will\r\n\r\nspeak more on this when we consider the estimates under PMO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Dr Hu's E-Budget 2000 signals a new age.\r\n\r\nAs  we  move forward, let us remind ourselves of some of  the\r\n\r\naxioms  that  we often hear and speak of. We  must  create  a\r\n\r\nthinking  people  and a learning nation.   We  must  try  and\r\n\r\nmaximise   the  potential  of  not  just  every  student   or\r\n\r\nundergraduate in our universities or schools, but also  every\r\n\r\ncitizen,  young or old, skilled or unskilled, who is  in  the\r\n\r\nworkforce, and the housewives.  We must develop and  maximise\r\n\r\ntheir  potential.   Let  us not allow the  tentacles  of  the\r\n\r\ndigital age divide us.  Let us remain one nation, one  people\r\n\r\nand one Singapore for many more years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to participate in the Budget debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget tabled by the Minister for Finance is a\r\n\r\ncarefully crafted Budget, with emphasis placed on the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the ageing citizens and the low-income families, the need\r\n\r\nto  encourage innovation, creativity and enterprise  and  the\r\n\r\ncontinued  liberalisation  of  the  financial  sector.    The\r\n\r\nbusiness  sector  welcomes  the  corporate  income  tax  rate\r\n\r\nreduction  from 26% to 25.5% and the retention of  employers'\r\n\r\nCPF contribution rate at 10%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuntil  1st April this year. The Minister has obviously shared\r\n\r\nthe concern of businessmen that, as the economic recovery has\r\n\r\njust  begun  and not evenly spread, it is still important  to\r\n\r\nkeep   business  costs  at  a  competitive  level.   Workers,\r\n\r\nrecognising  that it is crucial to help keep  business  costs\r\n\r\nlow,   continue   to   accept  the   lower   employers'   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution. They are somewhat compensated by rebates on HDB\r\n\r\nservice  and conservancy charges and rental rebates.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  a  Budget of balanced consideration in  the  sense\r\n\r\nthat it tries to take care of the welfare and benefits of the\r\n\r\nlow-income  earners,  businessmen, as  well  as  enterprising\r\n\r\nyoung entrepreneurs.  In terms of revenue and expenditure, it\r\n\r\nis  projected to produce a surplus of $2.45 billion.  As both\r\n\r\noperating and development expenditures are greater than those\r\n\r\nof  the last Budget, it is relatively expansionary, which  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to support the recovery of the economy.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.48 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One emphasis of the Budget is to encourage innovation,\r\n\r\ncreativity and enterprise.  Under this heading, the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  proposed  removing  the  restrictions  that  residential\r\n\r\nproperties  must  not  be  used  for  any  form  of  business\r\n\r\nactivities,  which is a qualifying condition for estate  duty\r\n\r\nexemption  up  to  $9 million.  The purpose is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs who may want to work from home and  to  support\r\n\r\nthe  Technopreneur  Home  Office Scheme.   I  have,  however,\r\n\r\ndoubts on the effectiveness of the proposed removal of  these\r\n\r\nrestrictions. Technopreneurs are mostly young risk-takers who\r\n\r\nhave  new  ideas but limited financial means.  They  want  to\r\n\r\nwork from home in order to reduce the initial start-up costs.\r\n\r\nThe notion of disqualifying them for estate duty exemption as\r\n\r\na  result of using their residence as home office is probably\r\n\r\nleast  of  their concern.  The reason is that they are  young\r\n\r\nand paying estate duty upon death is something very remote to\r\n\r\nthem.   As  such, the removal of the qualifying condition  is\r\n\r\nequally least of their concern and will likely fail to excite\r\n\r\nthem.  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntherefore  do  not  see  how  the proposed  relaxation  would\r\n\r\nsupport the would-be technopreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, estate duty itself has long been\r\n\r\nregarded  as  a disincentive for greater wealth  creation  by\r\n\r\nindividuals  in  today's world. The purpose of  the  original\r\n\r\nestate duty, which was known as death and gift taxes, was  to\r\n\r\nreduce  inequalities in the distribution  of  wealth  and  to\r\n\r\nprevent large estates passing from one generation to the next\r\n\r\ngeneration.  The rationale behind is therefore social and not\r\n\r\nfor  revenue generation. However, the social reason to retain\r\n\r\nestate duty may no longer be valid in our present context. We\r\n\r\ndo  not  subscribe to the philosophy that income  and  wealth\r\n\r\ndistribution should be completely equal for individuals.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  support  greater rewards to individuals  who  work\r\n\r\nharder  and contribute more to economic growth.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  there  are not too many large  estates  which\r\n\r\nwarrant their being broken into smaller estates.  In the  few\r\n\r\ncases  which  we  may  have  had,  the  natural  process   of\r\n\r\ninheriting  estates by a number of children will break  large\r\n\r\nestates  into  smaller ones.  This, to some extent,  fulfills\r\n\r\nthe aim of the estate duty legislation without the agony of a\r\n\r\ncomplicated administrative process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the revenue side, the collection amount is small and\r\n\r\nrelatively   insignificant.   In   Singapore,   the   revenue\r\n\r\ncollected from estate duty was $45 million, out of the  total\r\n\r\nrevenue of $15,628 million in 1998, which was only 0.28%  and\r\n\r\nwas the smallest tax item.  In addition, estate planning will\r\n\r\nfurther minimise the collectable amount of estate duty.  This\r\n\r\nincludes the setting up of trusts and holding companies which\r\n\r\nare  effective in avoiding tax payments.  But the setting  up\r\n\r\nof  trusts and holding companies itself is a tedious  process\r\n\r\nand it involves large amounts of legal costs.  Perhaps, it is\r\n\r\ntimely to review the estate duty ordinance to see whether the\r\n\r\nAct  should be revised further, or whether estate duty should\r\n\r\nbe exempted for residential properties, irrespective of their\r\n\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may argue that most people are not liable\r\n\r\nto pay estate duty as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  exemption amount of $9 million for a residence is  high.\r\n\r\nBut  the  agony of assets being frozen for investigation  and\r\n\r\nvaluation is an unnecessary burden to bear.  In his reply  in\r\n\r\nthe  old  Parliament  Chamber  on  26th  November  1998,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  promised  to  consider introducing  legislation  to\r\n\r\nexempt  small estates, and to give an answer to requests  for\r\n\r\nabolishing  estate  duty in the present Budget.   However,  I\r\n\r\nhave found no reference on this topic by the Minister in  the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement.  I would therefore be very much obliged  if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  could  share with us  his  thoughts  on  these\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, this year's Budget is a cautious one.   It  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  acceptable by the people in Singapore.   Realising\r\n\r\nthat  in 1997 and 1998, we faced an economic crisis,  and  in\r\n\r\n1999   we  were beginning to recover, my constituency leaders\r\n\r\nare quite happy with the rebates and tax exemption and income\r\n\r\ntax  of 5% granted in this year's Budget.  The residents will\r\n\r\nalso  get  rebates  on  service and conservancy  charges  and\r\n\r\nrentals  for their flats. On top of that, everyone  above  21\r\n\r\nyears  old  will  get  a  CPF  top-up  of  $250.  These   tax\r\n\r\nincentives,  though cannot be described as a  big  \"hongbao\",\r\n\r\nare  nevertheless  a good gift.  For the business  community,\r\n\r\nthe corporate tax has been further reduced from 26% to 25.5%.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also a breakthrough.  However, on property  tax,  the\r\n\r\nrebate  has  been reduced from 50% to 25%.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nexpress my views on this item.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, this tax rebate was geared towards high-tax\r\n\r\nenterprises  but they neglect those hawkers  and  some  small\r\n\r\nmerchants  and traders.  In 1994, the Government announced  a\r\n\r\nscheme   to   sell   the  hawker  stalls  to   the   existing\r\n\r\nstallholders.  Altogether  there  were  1,627   cooked   food\r\n\r\nhawker/market stalls.  Out of these, 299 cooked food and  189\r\n\r\nmarket  stalls  were sold.   After they have purchased  their\r\n\r\nstalls,  the  hawkers who took the loans from the  commercial\r\n\r\nbanks,  the repayment period is 10 years and up to a  maximum\r\n\r\nof 15 years. Some stallholders purchased their stalls in 1994\r\n\r\non a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n20-year  lease.  After operating for six years, they  decided\r\n\r\nto  quit  and wanted to sell the stalls. They could not  find\r\n\r\nanyone  to  take over because the banks were not prepared  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  loan as the lease had only 14 years  remaining.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the stallholders have no choice but to  carry  on\r\n\r\nwith  their  business  at  the  stalls.   These  stalls   are\r\n\r\nscattered  in housing estates and their customers are  mainly\r\n\r\nHDB  flat dwellers.  The hawkers have to raise prices to cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  high overheads and this has affected the residents\r\n\r\nthere. Many stallholders told me that they had to pay  $2,500\r\n\r\nto  $3,500  in property tax and the monthly payment  is  from\r\n\r\n$250  to  $300 which is more than the rental which they  were\r\n\r\npaying prior to the purchase of the stalls.  They were paying\r\n\r\nrentals  at $160 per month only.  This is a big headache  for\r\n\r\nthem.  This is in addition to the loan payment they  have  to\r\n\r\nmake to the bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market stallholders particularly are finding it\r\n\r\ndifficult to make ends meet. Their operating hours  are  very\r\n\r\nshort,  that  is,  from 7 am to 10 am. So  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can give more rebates on property tax to them.  If\r\n\r\nthey  could get 50% rebate, it would be better, or else  they\r\n\r\nshould  revalue  their stalls and then  give  them  more  tax\r\n\r\nrebate on property tax.  If the stallholders find that  their\r\n\r\nburden  is  too heavy, this will defeat the original  aim  of\r\n\r\nselling the stalls to them.  On the other hand, residents  of\r\n\r\nHDB estates will have to pay higher prices, thereby adding to\r\n\r\ntheir  burden.   Therefore, I would  urge  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance to consider giving them special treatment on property\r\n\r\ntax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the clan associations have to\r\n\r\npay quite high property tax.  Singapore is a multi-racial and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious  society.  In order to forge racial  harmony,\r\n\r\nto  live  together  and to build a harmonious  society,  clan\r\n\r\nassociations  have  made  tremendous  contributions  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.   Before we set up grassroots organisations and  RCs,\r\n\r\nthe  clan  associations have already done  a  lot  to  foster\r\n\r\nracial  harmony  between the different  races  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nEven today, in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmidst of prosperity in Singapore, our clan associations still\r\n\r\nplay a very important role.  There are many clan associations\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  like the Lee Association, Wu Association,  Tan\r\n\r\nAssociation  and  so  on  and  so  forth.   All  these   clan\r\n\r\nassociations have done a lot for their members and they  have\r\n\r\ncarried   out  various  activities  for  their   members   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  cohesiveness  of  their  members.   This  is\r\n\r\nbeneficial to our national solidarity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a clan association conducted a seminar to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  their  common problem of having  to  pay  very  high\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  on their premises.  Property  tax  is  levied,\r\n\r\nbased  on  the commercial rates of the buildings.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  hope the Government will give them special treatment.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if these associations make use of certain  areas  of\r\n\r\nthe  premises for other purposes, then they should  be  taxed\r\n\r\naccording to commercial rate.  But if these premises are used\r\n\r\nfor  their own purposes and for conducting social activities,\r\n\r\na  lower property tax should be levied on them or no  tax  at\r\n\r\nall.   These  associations' revenue depends on the management\r\n\r\ncommittees  and  members'  subscriptions  or  from  voluntary\r\n\r\ndonations.   However, they have to pay income  tax  on  these\r\n\r\ndonations.    Therefore,  the  council   members   of   these\r\n\r\nassociations hope that the Government can accord them special\r\n\r\ntreatment,  because  the  activities  they  carry   out   are\r\n\r\ncharitable  in nature.   It is not profit-making.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthese  revenues should not be taxed at all by the Government.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the Government will consider the two points  that  I\r\n\r\nhave raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make use of this opportunity to\r\n\r\ncongratulate our Minister for Finance and the Government  for\r\n\r\nturning a projected deficit of $5.1 billion into a surplus of\r\n\r\n$3.2  billion.  I would like to applaud them for this special\r\n\r\nfeat.  This is also a testimony to their sound management  of\r\n\r\nour  economy  and our finances.  I would like to congratulate\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance and I hope that we will accrue more\r\n\r\nsurpluses in the next financial year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Harun Bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun Bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Budget tabled by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance.   I  wish  to  congratulate  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, Dr Richard Hu, on the announcement  of\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Budget Statement in which he announced  several\r\n\r\nmeasures  which I think could foster family spirit among  our\r\n\r\nyounger  generation.  I am referring to the incentives  given\r\n\r\nnot only to parents but also to grandparents, and at the same\r\n\r\ntime  foster a three tier family unit that includes children,\r\n\r\nparents and grandparents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look carefully at the financial incentives given\r\n\r\nto  children  for maintaining their parents and grandparents,\r\n\r\nit  may sound odd.  It seems that these measures encourage  a\r\n\r\nmaterialistic culture among our young generation.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nif our children could look after the welfare of their parents\r\n\r\nand  grandparents without the financial incentives, we should\r\n\r\nbe  thankful, because it is something ideal that we dream of.\r\n\r\nHowever, in reality, it would only remain as a dream  because\r\n\r\nwithout such financial incentives, I think it is not easy for\r\n\r\nus   to  encourage  our  young  generation  to  shoulder  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities   of  looking  after   their   parents   and\r\n\r\ngrandparents.  This, however, should be an embedded value  in\r\n\r\nour young generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad that attention was also given to the low-income earners who could not afford or are helpless in\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the  welfare  of their  parents  through  the\r\n\r\nElderCare Fund.  This is because the low-income earners often\r\n\r\nface  hardship  in  their  life.  To maintain  themselves  is\r\n\r\nalready  a problem; what more if they have to look after  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of their aged parents who require medical attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like to propose that more\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim  homes for the aged be set  up  in  one  or  two\r\n\r\nyears'  time  to  meet the future needs of  the  Malay/Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.   It  is not my intention to encourage  the  young\r\n\r\ngeneration  to place their aged parents in these  homes.   In\r\n\r\nfact, I feel that the addition of these homes is necessary to\r\n\r\nmeet the needs in the next five or six years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, by encouraging more Singapore citizens to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  skills  and secure better  jobs  with  higher\r\n\r\nincome\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  lower  the  number  of low-income  earners  among  the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim community.  Once this is achieved, there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to  increase  the number of homes  for  the  aged.   In\r\n\r\naddition, the proposed Supplementary Retirement Scheme  (SRS)\r\n\r\nwould  hopefully be able to meet the needs of  the  retirees.\r\n\r\nHowever, this objective may not be achieved in 10 years' time\r\n\r\nand,  as  such,  I  feel  that while  waiting  for  a  better\r\n\r\nsituation  in the next 10 years, the addition of one  or  two\r\n\r\nmore homes for the aged is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Monthly Digest of Statistics, it\r\n\r\nis   estimated  that  about  15,000  Singapore  citizens  die\r\n\r\nannually.  Their deaths are due to various diseases   -   old\r\n\r\nage,  accidents,  homicides  and  so  on.   What  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nhighlight  here  is  the  deaths  caused  by  road  accidents\r\n\r\ninvolving vehicles and innocent people as a result of drunken\r\n\r\ndriving  and deaths by accidents.  We found that  200  people\r\n\r\nhave  died, 396 with serious injuries and over 8,500 suffered\r\n\r\nminor  injuries.  From the 200 people who died, we  were  not\r\n\r\nable  to  identify how many were due to drunken driving;  and\r\n\r\nthe fights that took place at coffeeshops, hawker centres and\r\n\r\nat homes which were all due to excessive alcohol consumption.\r\n\r\nDrug addicts who could not get drugs would indulge themselves\r\n\r\nin alcohol consumption and when they become drunk, they cause\r\n\r\nsocial  problems  by  committing  theft,  housebreaking   and\r\n\r\noutraging  modesty.   As  such, I  wonder  why  there  is  no\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  tax on alcohol.  I hope  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance   would   consider  my  proposal  so   that   alcohol\r\n\r\nconsumption could be reduced and our youths will  find  it  a\r\n\r\npinch  when buying and consuming alcohol.  On the other hand,\r\n\r\nthis  will increase the revenue of the Government from $343.1\r\n\r\nmillion   to   possibly  $500  million  a  year.   Otherwise,\r\n\r\nalcoholism will be a way of life for our youths to show  that\r\n\r\nthey  are \"cool\" and somebody.  And what will happen  to  our\r\n\r\nyouths in future when they indulge in drinking alcohol?\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\n1998, we experienced the full impact of the regional crisis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand economic growth had slowed sharply to 1.5%.  In 1999, the\r\n\r\nMinister  in his Budget Statement cautioned another difficult\r\n\r\nyear   ahead.   In  the  end,  we  registered  a   remarkable\r\n\r\nturnaround and achieved that overall growth of 5.4%.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  register  my  gratitude to  the  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for having so ably steered Singapore out  of  the\r\n\r\nAsian economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the general response to the Budget 2000 is \"Nothing\r\n\r\ndramatic\".   The dominant sentiment is this: if the  business\r\n\r\nmeasures  adopted  in  the 1999 Budget  had  yielded  such  a\r\n\r\nremarkable  V-shaped recovery, what are the reasons  for  not\r\n\r\ncontinuing with the measures for another 12 months  to  allow\r\n\r\nthose  sectors already rebounded to reap an even higher level\r\n\r\nof growth while giving more time for weaker sectors, like the\r\n\r\nconstruction, financial services and businesses to get out of\r\n\r\ntheir  recession?  The decision to stop these incentives  and\r\n\r\nrebates  which  are particularly significant  to  these  weak\r\n\r\nsectors  seems  difficult  to understand  when  we  weigh  it\r\n\r\nagainst an unexpected budget surplus of $3.2 billion in FY99,\r\n\r\na  forecast  of economic growth between 4.6% and 6.5%  and  a\r\n\r\nbudget surplus of $2.5 billion in FY2000.  We need some  very\r\n\r\ngood explanations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many would agree with the Government that we need\r\n\r\nto  live within our means and accumulating surpluses in order\r\n\r\nto deal with sudden downturns again, many would query how the\r\n\r\nGovernment balances the gains by taking back the goodies  and\r\n\r\nthe  possible  losses  to  the  private  sector  which  needs\r\n\r\ncontinuing  fiscal support for just another  12  months.   If\r\n\r\nthese  firms  cannot  make  it  for  FY2000,  what  are   the\r\n\r\nimplications  for employment and family well-being?   Is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  prepared  to pick up these  companies  when  they\r\n\r\nfail, or is the Government going to let them vanish, sticking\r\n\r\nby  the  cardinal  law of the survival  of  the  fittest  and\r\n\r\nablest?   Sir, many companies do not belong to this category.\r\n\r\nHence,  we need the Government to play a stronger, supportive\r\n\r\nrole.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn to the social and community sector.\r\n\r\nWhile  observing that the overall expenditure priorities  for\r\n\r\nthe  social and community services account for 39.6%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  expenditure, or an allocation of $11.5 billion, it  is\r\n\r\neducation,  public  housing,  health  and  environment  which\r\n\r\nreceive  a larger chunk of the allocation.   These are  well-deserved  investment, Sir.  MCD, on the other hand,  receives\r\n\r\nonly  5%  of the sector allocation followed by MITA receiving\r\n\r\n3%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the allocation of $610 million to MCD\r\n\r\nregistered a substantial increase of 38% over the last  year,\r\n\r\nand   within  the  MCD,  the  Elderly  Development  Programme\r\n\r\nbenefitting an increased allocation by 55% to $12.3  million,\r\n\r\nthe feeling in the community is that the Government could  do\r\n\r\nmore.   Within  the perspective of the family  and  community\r\n\r\nservices  being  seen  as central heartware  institutions  to\r\n\r\ncreate the level of cohesiveness for Singapore to function as\r\n\r\na  competitive  economy, $610 million  spent  on  operations,\r\n\r\nPeople's Association Programme and delivering social services\r\n\r\nand  sports  facilities to a population of 3.8 million  which\r\n\r\naverages  a per capita annual expenditure of $160  per  head,\r\n\r\ntotalling  a  monthly  $13 per head,  are  clearly  not  over\r\n\r\ngenerous.   I  would like to know how we fare  compared  with\r\n\r\nother countries, if the Minister could provide the figures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, our ageing population will need\r\n\r\nspecialised  care services and personnel which are  expensive\r\n\r\nto  develop and sustain.  Without the many helping hands from\r\n\r\nthe  community and the private sector, this budget allocation\r\n\r\nto  MCD  cannot  cater  to  the needs  of  the  disadvantaged\r\n\r\nfamilies,  the  young,  the  old,  the  vulnerable  like  the\r\n\r\ndisabled and the intellectually challenged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many loving and willing hearts, Sir, but the\r\n\r\ncommunity donors and volunteers are stretched.  The same fund-raisers are chasing the few generous donors and the needs are\r\n\r\nforever  expanding, with more and newer services required  to\r\n\r\nattend  to the emerging needs of a complex society.  Can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment please look into its funding principles for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsocial  and  community  services in particular,  and  respond\r\n\r\ngenerously  to future recommendations put forward by  various\r\n\r\ncommunity  agencies,  not only those working  on  the  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is indeed a feeling that not enough is done for\r\n\r\nrestoring family wellness, not enough is committed  to  youth\r\n\r\nactivities  and  interests, even less  is  provided  for  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged and dysfunctional families with multiple social\r\n\r\nproblems.   As to developing research competence to  help  us\r\n\r\nidentify   new   concepts  and  methods  in  organising   the\r\n\r\ncommunity, our resources and effort leave much to be desired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister will ask how much is enough and caution me\r\n\r\nthat  giving more to one Ministry will mean less for  another\r\n\r\nequally  worthy  programme, that I must  always  assess  what\r\n\r\ncounts and what matters in the overall scheme of development.\r\n\r\nBut  I urge the Government to look at people's needs, not  at\r\n\r\ncost allocation alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that investment on social fundamentals in\r\n\r\nmatters  related to the family and the community is a process\r\n\r\nof  enhancement intrinsically important in themselves,  while\r\n\r\nserving  as  a  significant supplement to a market  mechanism\r\n\r\nwhich  leaves many struggling behind in the development race.\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  Sir, economic growth at 5.4% a year  only  means\r\n\r\nprogress  if  we use more of the money to allow  families  to\r\n\r\nlead the kind of lives which they have reason to value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Minister that MCD, like any other\r\n\r\nMinistry,  must get the most out of their allotted  resources\r\n\r\nby  managing  them  well  in order  to  achieve  the  desired\r\n\r\noutcome.   However,  community  programmes  that  deal   with\r\n\r\ndysfunctional   families  and  youths,  including   eldercare\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and counselling programmes for the  abused,  rape\r\n\r\nvictims and violent perpetrators do not yield easily tangible\r\n\r\nand  immediate outcome, and they are not easily  audited  and\r\n\r\nmeasured.   This  is  not to say that the Ministry  must  not\r\n\r\nattempt  to  do  so, but the exercise requires  a  tremendous\r\n\r\namount of human and research resources.  Our habitual\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npragmatic scrutiny of outputs and tangible outcome very often\r\n\r\nmake  us  fail to respond with open mindedness and  accept  a\r\n\r\nlevel  of  \"untidiness\" in the community sector.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature  of complexity, all the more we need  to  commit\r\n\r\nenergy,  resources, skills and time to level up services  and\r\n\r\ninvolve community participation in developing an audit  blue-print to set best practices and performance indicators.   The\r\n\r\neasy  part  in  project planning is spelling out  the  social\r\n\r\nobjectives.  It is less certain that we are able to agree  on\r\n\r\nclear  indicators that are understood and shared by different\r\n\r\nMinistries  and the people sector.  Sir, this has  to  be  an\r\n\r\nevolving process and we need more resources to set the  right\r\n\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I noted the decrease in budgeted development\r\n\r\nfor  MCD by 15.4%.  This year, I am pleased to note that  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure of MCD registers  a  98.6%  increase\r\n\r\nover FY 1999 and many community projects are in the planning.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the Minister for Community Development and his  team\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  heed the appeals from the  community  and\r\n\r\nMembers of this House during the debate on the estimates  and\r\n\r\nchampion our causes before the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is indeed a conservative and a prudent\r\n\r\nbudget.   The  economy has recovered.   How  else  could  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  finances show a turn around of $8.3 billion  last\r\n\r\nyear  -  from  a  projected deficit of  $5.1  billion  to  an\r\n\r\nunexpected  surplus of $3.2 billion?  Yet, in spite  of  this\r\n\r\nunexpected sterling performance of the economy, the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  seen  it fit to remove or reduce almost all the measures\r\n\r\ngiven  in  prior years to reduce the tax burden of taxpayers,\r\n\r\nindividuals as well as corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result, as we can see, is a projected Government\r\n\r\nsurplus  of  $2.5 billion for the coming fiscal year.   Given\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Ministry's well-known bias  of  underestimating\r\n\r\nrevenue and overestimating\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpenditure, this figure could well be much higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to bring the attention of this House\r\n\r\nto  just one item, that of corporate taxes, as an example  to\r\n\r\nillustrate this.  In the Budget book on page 21, the  revised\r\n\r\ncollection  in 1999 from corporate taxes is estimated  to  be\r\n\r\n$6.2  billion.  The projected figure for FY 2000 is estimated\r\n\r\nto be $6.75 billion, an increase of $550 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us then look at the Minister's Budget statement on\r\n\r\nCorporate Income Tax section.  In it he said that the revenue\r\n\r\nloss  arising from the reduction in corporate tax  rate  from\r\n\r\n26% to 25.5% would amount to $140 million.  In other words, a\r\n\r\n0.5% reduction amounts to a loss of $140 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with this, except that we must\r\n\r\nnot forget that 1999's revised collection was estimated after\r\n\r\na rebate of 10% from a tax rate of 26%, or effectively a 2.6%\r\n\r\nrebate.  This rebate has been removed from this year's budget\r\n\r\nwhile  the  loss of $140 million will only take  effect  from\r\n\r\nnext year, as this drop of 0.5% will only take effect in  the\r\n\r\nyear  of  assessment 2001.  In other words, there is  a  claw\r\n\r\nback of tax collections in this section to IRAS for this year\r\n\r\nresulting from the removal of the 2.6% rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would this sum be? Based on simple arithmetic and\r\n\r\nthe  same  corporate  profit base, it would  amount  to  $728\r\n\r\nmillion.   This  is  based  on 0.5%  is  equivalent  to  $140\r\n\r\nmillion,  and  therefore 2.6% would  be  equivalent  to  $728\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, 1999's collection was based on the actual\r\n\r\ncorporate  results  in 1998, a year in which  most  corporate\r\n\r\nprofits  were  ravaged.  On the other hand, this  year's  tax\r\n\r\ncollection  would be based on last year's corporate  results.\r\n\r\nWe  all  know, Sir, that most corporations had been reporting\r\n\r\nmuch improved corporate figures for last year.  Thus, I would\r\n\r\nexpect the taxable base for this year, which is based on last\r\n\r\nyear's corporate result, to be much higher than that of  Year\r\n\r\nof Assessment 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this, Sir, I expect the increase in the\r\n\r\ncollection  of corporate tax could be much higher  than  $728\r\n\r\nmillion, yet the Budget book shows only an  increase of  $550\r\n\r\nmillion.   I  am not against the Government taking  a  bigger\r\n\r\nbite of the expected bigger economic pie.  But I question the\r\n\r\ntiming  of  this  policy.   We have  just  recovered  from  a\r\n\r\nrecession.    Private  sector  wealth  of   individuals   and\r\n\r\ncorporations has been badly mauled.  In the light of economic\r\n\r\nglobalisation and competition, the Government has been urging\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector  to  take greater  risks.  Sir,  a  most\r\n\r\nappropriate and correct call, but how can the private  sector\r\n\r\ndo  this  when, at the first sign of recovery, the Government\r\n\r\nimplements  measures to nip the rebuilding  of  such  private\r\n\r\nsector  wealth so necessary to provide the basis  for  taking\r\n\r\ngreater risks?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, budgetary measures such as those in this\r\n\r\nyear's Budget are matters of judgment and timing.  Whether or\r\n\r\nnot  the  Minister's judgment to remove  or  reduce  the  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  measures  now is correct, we will  never  know.   The\r\n\r\nremoval  of these measures is not that major in that economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  will be visibly affected.  All it means  is  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  have lost some time in the global competition of  being\r\n\r\nthere  first.   Unfortunately, in today's  fast-paced  global\r\n\r\nmarket place, especially in the new technological engines  of\r\n\r\neconomic growth, speed and being there first is of the utmost\r\n\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would have expected that after the recession the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would use the Budget to signal  a  more  forward-looking policy for Singapore.  Unfortunately, in this  year's\r\n\r\nBudget,  there are few such signals.  I would  thus  like  to\r\n\r\ntouch on three areas where such signals should be set.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are: (1) Tax deduction for contributions to S21\r\n\r\nprogrammes;  (2) Tax deduction for venture capital;  and  (3)\r\n\r\nClosing the digital divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in S21, we have come up with a first class vision\r\n\r\nof  what we, as Singaporeans, want Singapore to be.  We agree\r\n\r\nthat   we   should   take  a  more  participative   role   as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans; active citizenship, civil society, helping  our\r\n\r\nless fortunate and less\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nable fellow citizens, and so on and so forth.  All these call\r\n\r\nfor greater resources from the average Singaporeans, in terms\r\n\r\nof willingness, time, effort and money.  While the Government\r\n\r\ncannot,  in  the  short  term, do  much  to  promote  greater\r\n\r\nparticipation in the first three areas, that is, willingness,\r\n\r\ntime  and  effort, there is much it can do to encourage  more\r\n\r\nmonetary contributions from Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government can afford to be more generous\r\n\r\nwith   the   treatment  of  tax  deductions   to   designated\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and  projects.  For example, some  institutions\r\n\r\nand  projects  could  be designated as S21  institutions  and\r\n\r\nprojects.   Contributions to such institutions  and  projects\r\n\r\ncould then qualify for double tax deductions.  Or if this  is\r\n\r\ntoo generous, maybe 1.5 times tax deduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong signal will then be sent to all and sundry,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  this  is  the direction we want  to  go,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will do all it can to encourage all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntowards  that direction.  Double tax deduction as a means  to\r\n\r\npromote  desired  objectives is not new.  It  had  been  done\r\n\r\nbefore;  with success, I must add.  Surely, it  will  not  be\r\n\r\nmisplaced in this instance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Sir, those supporting such specific\r\n\r\ninstitutions and projects, though initially encouraged by the\r\n\r\ngreater financial benefit of higher tax deductions, may begin\r\n\r\nto  identify with such institutions and projects.  With time,\r\n\r\nownership  and subsequent involvement then becomes that  much\r\n\r\neasier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for suggesting financial methods\r\n\r\nto  encourage  the  attainment of the high ideals  and  goals\r\n\r\nembodied  in S21, I know that I take on the danger  of  being\r\n\r\nbranded  as crass or gross.  How can I bring in the  idea  of\r\n\r\nsullying S21 with Mammon?  If so, I make no apologies for it.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us not forget that however crass the idea may  be,\r\n\r\nmoney is a strong motivating factor.  Second, we need not  be\r\n\r\nso  altruistic that we forgo one of the strongest  motivating\r\n\r\nfactors  to reach our objectives.  Remember that the goal  is\r\n\r\nto get greater involvement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand participation.  Once that goal is reached, very often the\r\n\r\nreasons why one started to participate and be involved in the\r\n\r\nfirst place are often forgotten.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, we are always fond of quoting the\r\n\r\nparticipation of Americans in their civil society  and  their\r\n\r\nfinancial contributions to charitable and educational causes,\r\n\r\nand  how  we should emulate them.  But how many of us realise\r\n\r\nthat  one reason for their generosity is the regime  of  high\r\n\r\ntax rates in the United States and the tax shelters that such\r\n\r\ngenerosity  creates  for  them.   Does  it  matter  what  the\r\n\r\noriginal reasons are, when in the final analysis, the  nation\r\n\r\nbenefits from a more involved citizenry?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these days, we are bombarded with calls to be more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial and to take greater risks by our leaders,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  the Prime Minister and the Senior Minister.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has also done much to develop an environment which\r\n\r\nallows technopreneurial companies to start up and thrive.  As\r\n\r\na  matter  of  interest, only in last Friday's Straits  Times\r\n\r\nForum page, the National Science and Technology Board came up\r\n\r\nwith   a   long  list  of  initiatives  implemented  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first point of concern addressed in this letter\r\n\r\nwas   that  of  adequate  financing  being  crucial  to   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of technopreneurship.  How true!  And  I  applaud\r\n\r\nthe  truism of that statement.  But what I would like to  add\r\n\r\nis that what the Government had done is still inadequate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often, many a bright idea has died an untimely\r\n\r\ndeath  from  the  lack of seed money.   While  there  may  be\r\n\r\nventure  capitalists, these people would not normally finance\r\n\r\nstart-up  ideas.   Often,  they want  to  see  more  concrete\r\n\r\nevidences of potential successes than a dreamer with an idea,\r\n\r\na  burning ambition and a willingness to work 25 hours a day.\r\n\r\nLuckily for technopreneurs-to-be, before venture capitalists,\r\n\r\nthere  are the business angels, normally individuals who  are\r\n\r\nmore willing to finance dreamers with their own money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not have enough individuals who are\r\n\r\nprepared  to be angels.  I would certainly like to  see  more\r\n\r\nbusiness  angels.   With more angels,  we  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nsupport  more idealistic budding technopreneurs.  We will  be\r\n\r\nable to build a critical mass of individuals having some form\r\n\r\nof  financial support.  This is important as creativity  will\r\n\r\ncome from such individuals, not from corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is here that I have a bit of disagreement with my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr  Inderjit  Singh.   Sir,  his  call  for  more\r\n\r\nprivatisation includes clusters of funds to be managed by the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  If this be the case, nothing much  will  be\r\n\r\nchanged.   The  rules  for  managing  other  people's  money,\r\n\r\nwhether  by the private sector or the public sector, will  be\r\n\r\nthe same.  One still has to be very prudent, very careful and\r\n\r\nvery circumspect in decision making, because you are managing\r\n\r\nother  people's  money.  And that is why I am suggesting  the\r\n\r\nincentives for individuals.  It is only when individuals  are\r\n\r\nmaking  investment decisions with their own money  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  afford to be more generous and can afford to  take  more\r\n\r\nrisks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to suggest that the tax treatment in\r\n\r\nthis  area  be  changed to encourage the  emergence  of  more\r\n\r\nbusiness  angels.   Under  the current  Venture  Capital  Tax\r\n\r\nIncentive  Scheme,  the  investor  must  invest  in  approved\r\n\r\ncompanies  and can only claim relief as and when  the  losses\r\n\r\nfrom  the sale of shares of the venture company are incurred.\r\n\r\nSir, this is certainly not enough to encourage the growth  of\r\n\r\nbusiness angels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the Government should allow relief for such\r\n\r\ninvestments at the point of making the investment.  Also, the\r\n\r\nneed  for  the  venture  company to  be  approved  should  be\r\n\r\nscrapped.   The approving process implies that EDB  can  spot\r\n\r\nwinners and losers.  I doubt very much that EDB would dare to\r\n\r\nclaim  that it can do so.  Instead, general guidelines  could\r\n\r\nbe used to ensure that abuse of the scheme is minimised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if such a scheme were to be adopted, it would bring\r\n\r\nup two other issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that of the possible loss of too much tax\r\n\r\nrevenue. After all, the scheme as proposed creates a very big\r\n\r\ntax shelter for high taxpayers.  To prevent this, there could\r\n\r\nbe  a  limit  on the relief given.  For example,  the  relief\r\n\r\ncould  be  limited to, say, 50% of the taxable  income  of  a\r\n\r\ntaxpayer.   It  could  also  be a  graduated  scheme,  higher\r\n\r\npercentages  for  those with lower taxable  income  to  lower\r\n\r\npercentages for those with higher taxable income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that of capital gains. Our current system\r\n\r\nis  based  on  \"no  deductions for investments  and  thus  no\r\n\r\ncapital  gains tax on gains from investments\".  Allowing  tax\r\n\r\ndeductions for venture companies would mean that the investor\r\n\r\nstands  to  gain from both ends; tax relief at the  point  of\r\n\r\nmaking an investment and no capital gains tax at the end when\r\n\r\nthey are successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My answer to this issue is: why not? After all, we are\r\n\r\nencouraging  a  speedier fusion into a new world  and  a  new\r\n\r\neconomy.  If this scheme promotes that objective, what is the\r\n\r\nloss  of some tax dollars as compared to the benefits to  the\r\n\r\neconomy and community of the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the Government still cannot accept such\r\n\r\nthinking  out  of the box and feels an instinctive  need  for\r\n\r\norder  and symmetry, then I suggest a choice be given to  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  angel  at the point of investment.   And  this  is,\r\n\r\n\"Take  the  tax relief option now and pay capital  gains  tax\r\n\r\nwhen  your  venture succeeds later.  Or forgo the tax  relief\r\n\r\nnow  and  you do not have to pay capital gains tax when  your\r\n\r\nventure  succeeds\".  Since at the point of making  investment\r\n\r\nit  is  not  possible for the investor to  know  whether  his\r\n\r\ninvestment is going to succeed or not, I think it will  be  a\r\n\r\nfair choice to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On digital divide, I do not have to stress the\r\n\r\nimportance of this issue.  Enough of our leaders had  brought\r\n\r\nup this issue for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans to know that, if not resolved, it will  lay\r\n\r\nthe   foundation  for  economic,  social  and  perhaps,  even\r\n\r\ncommunal   divisions,  in  the  future.   Even  the   world's\r\n\r\nsuperpower  and  the powerhouse of IT and the  Internet,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  is  concerned about the digital  divide,  as\r\n\r\nevidenced  by President Clinton's recent State of  the  Union\r\n\r\naddress  on  the  subject  and his  budget  proposals  for  a\r\n\r\nmultibillion-dollar   plan  to  help   poor   Americans   and\r\n\r\nminorities  get  access  to  the  Internet  and  make  it  as\r\n\r\nuniversal as the telephone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I was very pleased when the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Information Technology recently unveiled a\r\n\r\n$25  million plan to bridge the digital divide and help every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  go online.  At least that is the  objective.   I\r\n\r\njust  hope  that  it would be the thin end of  the  wedge  to\r\n\r\nseriously  address this important issue.  If so, I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  wedge will thicken very quickly for there is so much  to\r\n\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, if the House could bear with me, I would like\r\n\r\nto  relate a story while I was with the Monetary Authority of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  was  in the late 70s and personal  computers\r\n\r\nwere  just coming into prominence.  In those days IT was  not\r\n\r\nknown as IT, not even known as IS (Information Systems).  But\r\n\r\nin  those  days  it  was known more as EDP  (Electronic  Data\r\n\r\nProcessing),  because computers were then  mainly  mainframes\r\n\r\nand  used  in  the backrooms for processing voluminous  data.\r\n\r\nOne  day,  we were told that every department was to  get  an\r\n\r\nApple  computer for its use.  The Government also implemented\r\n\r\na  scheme whereby public sector employees could obtain  cheap\r\n\r\nloans  to purchase personal computers.  We were surprised  as\r\n\r\nfew of us, other than those in the Electronic Data Processing\r\n\r\ndepartment, knew much of computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, I heard it whispered at the corridors of City\r\n\r\nHall and Fullerton Building that the late Mr Hon Sui Sen, the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister, had personally lobbied for this programme.\r\n\r\nI heard that he was told that the staff would only play games\r\n\r\nwith the computer, as few then knew how\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  use  the personal computer.  So why should the Government\r\n\r\nspend this money to put computers in the department when they\r\n\r\nwould be used to play games?  His retort was reportedly this:\r\n\r\n\"Let  them  play  games, as it would teach  them  how  to  be\r\n\r\nfamiliar with the computer.  However, someone somewhere  will\r\n\r\nknow something and he will use the computer for improving his\r\n\r\nwork.  And if that happens, we will progress.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was exactly what happened. The computer in my\r\n\r\ndepartment was first used mainly to play games, I  must  say.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, somebody came out with a VisiCalc  program  and\r\n\r\nalso other programs and we were able to use such programs  to\r\n\r\nimprove our work.  And the rest, as I said, Sir, is history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that today in this House there are some\r\n\r\nwho  knew exactly what happened then.  I have no idea whether\r\n\r\nthe version that I have just related is true or not.  If not,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  stand corrected.  I hope however that I am  correct,\r\n\r\nnot  because I am afraid of being corrected but because  such\r\n\r\nstories are the stuff of legends.  We must remember that  the\r\n\r\nlate Mr Hon was known as an extremely prudent and careful man\r\n\r\nwith  money, especially those belonging to the nation.   Yet,\r\n\r\nfor such a man to come out  with such an IT plan, even if the\r\n\r\ncomputers were used to play games in Government offices,  is,\r\n\r\nindeed,  visionary.  I think all of us in Singapore  owe  him\r\n\r\nmuch.  I know I do, as I would have never purchased my  first\r\n\r\ncomputer,  an  Apple  IIe, without the encouragement  of  the\r\n\r\nloan.   And I thank him for his part in making me a bit  less\r\n\r\ncomputer illiterate today than what I otherwise would be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this story is related not so much as to add to the\r\n\r\nlegend  of Mr Hon (though I hope that it does), but  more  to\r\n\r\nillustrate  that  visionary thinking and  speedy  action  are\r\n\r\nneeded in this area.  We should be bolder, much bolder in our\r\n\r\nplans to reduce the digital divide as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should aim for a 100% PC ownership in every home,\r\n\r\nsimilar to the goal of 100% home ownership.  We should ensure\r\n\r\ncheap  and fast access to the Internet for without such cheap\r\n\r\nand fast access, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomputer is just a machine and not the gateway to information\r\n\r\nand  the  future.   We should harness the assistance  of  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector through a system of tax incentives.  These are\r\n\r\nbut some of the ideas that I can come up with for the moment.\r\n\r\nBut  I  am  sure that the civil servants could come  up  with\r\n\r\nmore,  if  given  the go-ahead.  Sir, more  importantly,  the\r\n\r\nmindset must change.  We should not make investments in  this\r\n\r\narea  on  the  basis of economic returns alone.  Instead,  we\r\n\r\nshould   look  at  such  investments   from  a  communitarian\r\n\r\nperspective.  If the digital divide persists into the  future\r\n\r\nwhen the use of IT becomes that much more pervasive, can  our\r\n\r\ncommunity survive the divide?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like the Government to\r\n\r\nreconsider   its  policy  on  the  ownership   of   broadband\r\n\r\nelectronic highways, such as those provided by cable.   Cable\r\n\r\nmodem  access to the Internet certainly is fast.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  cheap.   Singapore  CableVision recently  announced  the\r\n\r\nslashing of prices for its broadband Internet access  service\r\n\r\nvia  the  cable modem.  The reduced prices would be  $76  per\r\n\r\nmonth  for those who subscribe only to the broadband service.\r\n\r\nTo  many  Singaporeans, let alone the poorer  ones,  this  is\r\n\r\ncertainly not cheap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned that, to date, SCV has only about\r\n\r\n8,000  subscribers to this service, including the  5,000  who\r\n\r\nwere on the trial service.  This means that since they opened\r\n\r\nup  in  December last year to all and sundry, they have  only\r\n\r\nincreased it by about 3,000 subscribers.  However, so long as\r\n\r\nSCV  continues with its high rates, there will  be  many  who\r\n\r\nwould   prefer  to  use  the  much  slower  dial-up  service,\r\n\r\nespecially  when some are provided free.  If it were  just  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  time  spent on the computer, I would  not  be  so\r\n\r\nconcerned.   But we know that there would be  more  and  more\r\n\r\nInternet  services needing broadband access.  If  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  high charges, many Singaporeans continue not to use  the\r\n\r\nSCV  broadband  access, then there could  be  more  and  more\r\n\r\nInternet services denied to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to take over the ownership of such\r\n\r\nelectronic  highways.   They are  like  our  expressways  and\r\n\r\nshould  be  publicly owned.  Internet service  providers  can\r\n\r\nthen   rent   them  from  the  Government  and  provide   the\r\n\r\ncompetition  so  necessary to improve quality and  efficiency\r\n\r\nwhile reducing cost to the consumer.  The events in the arena\r\n\r\nof  the dial-up services have shown that this can be done and\r\n\r\nwould  be  done,  if only there were competition.   Moreover,\r\n\r\nwith  public  ownership, the Government  can  then  charge  a\r\n\r\npolicy-dictated price that may not necessarily be an economic\r\n\r\nprice.   The  losses  could  then  be  subsidised  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's general revenues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the IT revolution has become too\r\n\r\nimportant  for the Government to ignore and to be treated  as\r\n\r\nsimply  another area of development.  Instead, it  should  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as  an essential public service, similar to  health,\r\n\r\neducation,  housing and security.  Anything less will  be  to\r\n\r\nthe peril of our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  in  support of the motion standing in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of business and government is dominated by\r\n\r\nbuzz words like \"e-commerce\", \"dot com\", \"portals\", \"eyeball\"\r\n\r\nand  \"Internet  economy\".  But what is  Internet  economy  or\r\n\r\nsometimes  loosely  termed  as the  new  economy  or  digital\r\n\r\neconomy?   The  truth  is  there is no  universally  accepted\r\n\r\ndefinition  for \"Internet economy\".  Economists have  trouble\r\n\r\ndefining  what  is the new economy, let alone understand  it.\r\n\r\nSome  used  the  term  to  describe the  combination  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  multi-billion dollar  Internet  companies  like\r\n\r\nYahoo  and American On-Line as well as the effects  that  the\r\n\r\nInternet has had and continues to have on businesses.   Since\r\n\r\nthe  driving force on the Internet is the US, some have  gone\r\n\r\nso far as to suggest that the Internet economy is also the US\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you know for certain is that Internet technologies\r\n\r\nand  applications have grown more rapidly  in  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears than any other singular event in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhuman  history  and the cumulative effect of  technology  and\r\n\r\nbusiness transactions alone done through the Internet is  the\r\n\r\nbackbone  of  the new economy and this has a profound  effect\r\n\r\nnot  only  on our lives but governments all over  the  world.\r\n\r\nThis  new  economy has continued to surpass all  expectations\r\n\r\nand  confounded experts and no lesser a person than even Alan\r\n\r\nGreenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Internet economy indicators, an on-going study\r\n\r\nof  the  Internet at the University of Texas funded by  CISCO\r\n\r\nSystem,  seek to quantify the Internet economy.  It  reported\r\n\r\nthat the industry generated US$300 billion annually, grew 68%\r\n\r\nfrom  the first quarter of 1998 to the first quarter of 1999,\r\n\r\naccounted  for  2.3  million jobs and is  expected  to  reach\r\n\r\nUS$507 billion by the end of last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another report from the Commerce Department in the US\r\n\r\nmeasured  the  \"digital economy\" which they  defined  as  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the hardware and software produced by the computer\r\n\r\nand  telecommunications industries.  It was reported that the\r\n\r\ndigital  economy accounted for 8% of America's  GDP,  a  very\r\n\r\nremarkable figure considering how new this economy is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are mind-boggling numbers. There will be\r\n\r\nabout 250-300 million global users of the Internet by the end\r\n\r\nof  this  year and still growing with some 65,000  new  users\r\n\r\nevery day.  Some 2,000 new secure web sites (secure web sites\r\n\r\nare  those  set  up  by  businesses) are  added  each  month,\r\n\r\nreflecting  the  creation of new companies  and  shifting  of\r\n\r\nexisting  businesses to the Internet.  All  these  impressive\r\n\r\ngrowth  numbers  must  mean that it  is  imperative  that  we\r\n\r\nunderstand the truly incredible impact the Internet will have\r\n\r\non  the  global  economy and Singapore's  role  in  this  new\r\n\r\nparadigm.

It  is  small  wonder  that\r\n\r\nbusinesses are moving their capital spending into technology,\r\n\r\nnot  just among technology companies, but also those in other\r\n\r\nmature industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia, a GS Asia Web report recently released by\r\n\r\nGoldman Sachs concluded that Internet users in Asia will grow\r\n\r\nby  a  compound annual growth rate of 40% bringing the  total\r\n\r\nnumber of Net users to 64 million by the year 2003.  This  is\r\n\r\nabout twice the growth rate of the US.  Extrapolating the  e-commerce  market in Asia is set to be worth US$32 billion  by\r\n\r\n2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in Singapore, the Gartner Group Incorporated\r\n\r\nreported  that Singapore spent US$484 million in business-to-business (B to B) transactions and US$101 million in business-to-consumer (B to C) transactions last year.  They forecasted\r\n\r\nthat  by  the  year 2003, B to B and B to C will total  US$11\r\n\r\nbillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these huge numbers, Government's e-commerce\r\n\r\nplans and promotion of venture capital activities, many  more\r\n\r\ncompanies  are expected to jump on the e-commerce  bandwagon.\r\n\r\nIf  these  statistics are anything to  go  by,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nInternet economy has arrived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving aside the social issues, the profound changes\r\n\r\nbrought  about by the Internet economy raises two key  issues\r\n\r\nfor  the Government.  Sir, the first relates to how this  new\r\n\r\neconomy  affects  Government planning and growth  forecasting\r\n\r\nand  how  this will affect areas, such as manpower,  economic\r\n\r\nmodelling, accounting for productivity improvements  and  the\r\n\r\neffect  of  wealth creation through high-tech  start-ups  and\r\n\r\nstock  market listings.  The second issue posed by  this  new\r\n\r\neconomy  is the potential loss in Government revenue  due  to\r\n\r\nlosses  in  GST  and  direct taxation.  Underlining  this  of\r\n\r\ncourse  is  the question of how are we prepared for  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion of the technology era will have\r\n\r\nimplication on the manpower planning of countries hot on  the\r\n\r\nheels  of  this  new  economy.  The  US,  for  instance,  has\r\n\r\nexperienced  changes  in  its  employment  and  wage   growth\r\n\r\npatterns  as  a result of the rapid pace of adoption  of  new\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers on the job suffer from a lingering sense of\r\n\r\ninsecurity.   Technology  has  led  to  higher  productivity,\r\n\r\nallowing firms to meet rising demand with the same number  of\r\n\r\nworkers.   The  remarkable growth of the US economy,  coupled\r\n\r\nwith  low inflation in the last decade, is attributed to  the\r\n\r\nhigh productivity contributed by technology and the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe  rapid increase in B to B and B to C e-commerce has  also\r\n\r\nmade redundant a whole host of middlemen from car salesmen to\r\n\r\nticketing agents and stock brokers to insurance agents.   The\r\n\r\nresult  is  also  a  mismatch of skills and labour  shortage.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  shortage of workers in the  new  economy  which\r\n\r\ncannot  be filled by workers who are made redundant as  their\r\n\r\nskills  are not what is required.  This must be a frightening\r\n\r\nprospect  not only for workers who are not well  versed  with\r\n\r\ntechnology, but for Government planners as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In almost every industry it touches, the Internet\r\n\r\nchanges  the role of the middlemen.  In a world in which  the\r\n\r\nInternet  can connect everyone, it is possible for businesses\r\n\r\nto  have  direct relationships with their clientele  and  not\r\n\r\nrely  on  distributors.  For example, dramatic  changes  have\r\n\r\nalso  occurred in the brokerage business.  Although middlemen\r\n\r\nremain  in the on-line investing world, they charge more  and\r\n\r\nprovide fewer services than their off-line rivals.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nthe  web  gives individuals the ability to buy stocks without\r\n\r\nusing a broker at all.  Why transact on-line?  In most cases,\r\n\r\nit is a matter of convenience besides lower cost.  It is also\r\n\r\neasier  to trade stocks on-line than it is to trade over  the\r\n\r\nphone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the not too distant future, the distinction between\r\n\r\non-line  and  off-line  financial services  will  fade  away.\r\n\r\nBanks\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwithout  Internet web sites will be as rare as banks  without\r\n\r\nATMs.   Lenders  without a web presence will find  themselves\r\n\r\nlosing   market  share.    Insurers  incapable  of  providing\r\n\r\nservices  over  the Internet will shrivel.   Eventually,  not\r\n\r\ngiving  customers  the ability to check  balances,  originate\r\n\r\nloans,  buy  insurance, or otherwise manage  their  financial\r\n\r\nlives over the Internet will cost institutions business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no time, employers and employees will have little\r\n\r\nalternative    but   to   seek   training   and    retraining\r\n\r\nopportunities.    This  will  have  great   impact   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's role and response in training and retraining and\r\n\r\nthe  role must increase in importance in the areas of  skills\r\n\r\ndevelopment and manpower planning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Macroeconomic Advisers, a St Louis-based economic\r\n\r\nconsultancy,  in  September last year, reported  evidence  of\r\n\r\ntechnology's  impact on productivity.  A new  analysis  shows\r\n\r\nthat  about half of the growth in non-farm businesses  in  US\r\n\r\ncan be explained by the benefits of computer-related advances\r\n\r\nand  investments.   The study found that productivity  growth\r\n\r\nhas recently been more than double the average since 1973 and\r\n\r\nwill remain over 2% for the next decade if current technology-investment  trends continue.  In the study by  University  of\r\n\r\nTexas,  Internet  firms  are  impressively  productive.   The\r\n\r\naverage revenue per Internet economy worker is US$250,000, or\r\n\r\n65%,  higher  than employees in the industrial economy.   The\r\n\r\nautomotive  industry, for example, in the US earns US$160,000\r\n\r\nin  revenue  per employee versus US$250,000 for  an  Internet\r\n\r\nemployee.  The US Department of Commerce forecasted last year\r\n\r\nthat  almost half of the American workforce will be  employed\r\n\r\nby information technology-related companies by the year 2006.\r\n\r\nIt  also  reported  that from 1990 to 1997,  digital  economy\r\n\r\ncompanies  achieved a \"robust\" 10.4% average growth  rate  in\r\n\r\nvalue  added  each  year per worker.  And  these  IT  workers\r\n\r\nearned  more than non-IT workers.  Finally, just last  month,\r\n\r\nthe  US Labour Department said worker productivity rose at  a\r\n\r\n5% annual rate during the fourth quarter of 1999, pushing the\r\n\r\naverage growth in productivity for all of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n1999  to 2.9%, the best the US has seen since 1992.  Internet\r\n\r\nand  technology  play  a vital role in  wealth  creation  and\r\n\r\nproductivity in the US, as confirmed by these figures.   This\r\n\r\nmust have a significant impact on Singapore as well.  I think\r\n\r\nthe  Government should take this into account in our economic\r\n\r\nmodelling,  especially  in the area of  forecasting.  Are  we\r\n\r\nworking  on  too  conservative a basis if the  United  States\r\n\r\nexample  is  anything  to  go by and  whether  our  budgeting\r\n\r\nprocess needs some form of an overhaul?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second important issue is the impact of the new\r\n\r\neconomy  on Government revenues. This new economy  where  the\r\n\r\ntransactions  in  the  provision of goods  and  services  are\r\n\r\ncarried   out  between  faceless  individuals  and   faceless\r\n\r\ncorporations domiciled in any corner of the world  will  pose\r\n\r\nthe   biggest  challenge  in  the  collection  of  Government\r\n\r\nrevenue.   In  the area of direct taxation, it makes  perfect\r\n\r\ngood  sense  for a corporation to locate the  source  of  the\r\n\r\nsupply of goods in a tax haven just to get themselves out  of\r\n\r\nthe  reach of the tax man. This is one potential large  drain\r\n\r\non Government coffers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other relates to indirect taxation. How does the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intend to tax every little parcel or packet  that\r\n\r\ngoes  into  a consumer home?  What about non-physical  goods?\r\n\r\nAnother  one of the key e-commerce tax policy issues  is  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  conversion  of  tangible  goods  into  intangible\r\n\r\ngoods.  At issue are products like computer software,  music,\r\n\r\nmovies, videos and even books that can be turned into digital\r\n\r\ncode  and downloaded by customers anywhere in the world.  For\r\n\r\nexample, currently if a British-based firm downloads  a  book\r\n\r\ninto a customer's computer, this will be considered a service\r\n\r\nand  will be taxed at the United Kingdom's rate of 17.5%. But\r\n\r\nif  this same company is based in the British Channel Islands\r\n\r\nor  outside  the EU, it will avoid this 17.5% tax completely.\r\n\r\nIn  Europe, tax officials have proposed that products sold in\r\n\r\ndigital  form  will  be taxed on the rate in  the  customer's\r\n\r\ncountry.   For  example, companies operating  in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  would have to collect taxes on all sales to  European\r\n\r\ncustomers.  In\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother  words, there has to be a reciprocal agreement  between\r\n\r\nnations  for the collection and remittance of tax on  out-of-state  basis.   Sir, my question to the Minister  is:   where\r\n\r\ndoes Singapore, a relatively small country and small economy,\r\n\r\nfit into this global scheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional retailers have gone on-line in droves.\r\n\r\n\"Click  and mortar\", denoting a combination of on-line  sales\r\n\r\nand traditional retailing, went from an unknown phrase in the\r\n\r\nbeginning of 1999 to a New Yorker headline -  making event by\r\n\r\nthe end of last year.  There is barely a traditional retailer\r\n\r\nleft  that  does not now accept the Internet  as  a  critical\r\n\r\nweapon  in its retail arsenal. A recent report in the  United\r\n\r\nStates  estimated that current tax revenue  losses  are  less\r\n\r\nthan  1% of total tax revenue collected.  However, losses  in\r\n\r\nthe immediate future could grow to 2% to 4%.  State and local\r\n\r\ngovernments also fear growth in Internet commerce will  drain\r\n\r\nsales in shopping malls and traditional retailers, causing  a\r\n\r\ndrop  in  sales  tax.  In Singapore, the impact  is  no  less\r\n\r\nprofound.  The Gartner Group has projected that by  the  year\r\n\r\n2003,  as  I  mentioned  earlier,  transactions  through  the\r\n\r\nInternet will total some US$11 billion.  Translated at 3%  is\r\n\r\na  total  loss  in  GST  collection of no  less  than  US$330\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States government has a headstart in this\r\n\r\narea  but has yet to arrive at Internet rules that will  curb\r\n\r\ntax  losses  as  a  result  of sales  transactions  over  the\r\n\r\nInternet.  It is important for other nations to speed up  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of setting Internet rules especially when e-commerce\r\n\r\nis still small enough and tax distortions are modest.  On the\r\n\r\nhome  front  in  Singapore,  it  is  pertinent  to  ask   the\r\n\r\nGovernment or the Minister on how it intends to address  this\r\n\r\ncritical issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new economy will pose tremendous challenges for\r\n\r\nGovernment as its working is not well-understood and, yet  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time, has immediate impact. We have to grapple with\r\n\r\nlots  of unknowns which are affecting our lives in a profound\r\n\r\nmanner.  My question is:  can the Government face up  to  the\r\n\r\nchallenge?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for permitting me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since many Members before me have spoken on the\r\n\r\ndetails of the Budget, allow me to touch on two topics  which\r\n\r\nI  feel  passionately about as they concern the future  well-being of Singapore and then comment on some specific areas of\r\n\r\ntaxation  which  I  would like the Finance Minister  to  give\r\n\r\nattention to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is on foreign talent. I recall how I listened\r\n\r\nin awe last year when Senior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, spoke\r\n\r\nduring  the  Singapore  21 debate about  the  criticality  of\r\n\r\nbringing in top talent into Singapore because we are now on a\r\n\r\nglobal  stage,  whether we like it or not.  It  really  drove\r\n\r\nhome  to  me  that as a pre-requisite for us to play  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal arena, we must have talents, whether local or foreign,\r\n\r\nwho  are  of global standard.  I am convinced more than  ever\r\n\r\nnow  as  I  too,  in my experience in working  for  a  multi-national corporation, am compelled to look for talent  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  shores  of  Singapore to carry  out  higher  value-added\r\n\r\nactivities where locals do not have the expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proverb \"time and tide waits for no man\" is more\r\n\r\nrelevant  now than ever. Technology has enabled  many  things\r\n\r\nnever  thought  possible  in the  past  and  is  changing  at\r\n\r\nlightning  speed  with  each passing day.   It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nhighly essential that we intensify the inflow of talent which\r\n\r\ncould  help us narrow the gap and catch up with those at  the\r\n\r\nleading edge of technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogy used by Senior Minister of how ATMs had\r\n\r\ndramatically  affected traditional banking  services  in  the\r\n\r\nrecent  past and how this is about to change again  with  the\r\n\r\nadvent  of  the  smartcard, is a clear demonstration  of  how\r\n\r\ntechnology  is  driving  and forcing change  in  the  banking\r\n\r\nindustry,  and how it will make many of the services  offered\r\n\r\nby  banks currently irrelevant in the not-too-distant future.\r\n\r\nIt is this \"change or risk becoming irrelevant\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nphenomenon that has forced the restructuring of our banks and\r\n\r\nbanking system and the pursuit of top talents like John  Olds\r\n\r\nand Alex Au.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am encouraged to note that the Trade and Industry\r\n\r\nMinister, BG George Yeo gave a convincing perspective of what\r\n\r\nforeign  talent  had done for Singapore in the  Sunday  Times\r\n\r\nyesterday and why we need them.  I think it is important that\r\n\r\nthis  subject be raised periodically.  Although by and large,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans generally accept foreign talent, many still feel\r\n\r\nthat  foreign talents deprive them of some of the  good  jobs\r\n\r\nwhich should have been theirs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to accelerate our KBE positioning and ensure\r\n\r\nSingapore's successful transition to a full-fledged knowledge-based  economy, we must be able to bring in the top  high-end\r\n\r\ntalent.  Evidently, the competition for such talent  is  also\r\n\r\nintense as we are meeting head-on with Silicon Valley and the\r\n\r\nother  top  places  in  the world - the Himalayan  peaks,  as\r\n\r\nMinister George Yeo puts it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to offering tip-top infrastructure and\r\n\r\nan   increasingly   intellectual   environment,   I   believe\r\n\r\nincentives matter a lot to this group of people.  I  know  of\r\n\r\nmany cases where attractive stock options made the difference\r\n\r\nbetween losing or winning a top candidate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If pioneer status or tax holiday has been a successful\r\n\r\ntool  to  lure MNCs to invest in Singapore, we must  look  at\r\n\r\nsuch  top individuals as intellectual capital, especially  in\r\n\r\nthe  context of KBE positioning.  It is therefore  imperative\r\n\r\nthat  we  find  ways  and means to incentivise  higher  level\r\n\r\nintellectual  capital to attract them to Singapore  and  stay\r\n\r\nhere for a period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the corporations doing their part to retain\r\n\r\ntalent,  the  Government  should  consider  making  the   tax\r\n\r\nenvironment  for such people more attractive. As an  example,\r\n\r\nwe could consider a progressive tax rebate system, say, a 30%\r\n\r\nrebate on their tax paid in the first year is given in  their\r\n\r\nfourth year of residence in Singapore, 40% in the fifth  year\r\n\r\nand so on, subject to a maximum cap.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary, such incentives could be confined to high-level talents who truly contribute and make a difference for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  just as pioneer status is not extended  to  every\r\n\r\nMNC   putting   in  their  money  here.  The   criteria   for\r\n\r\nqualification must be stringent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for talent attraction in general, I know much has\r\n\r\nalready  been  done  to  position  Singapore  as  a  hub  for\r\n\r\ninternational talent.  The setting up of the Kowloon Club for\r\n\r\nHongkongers,  for example, provides a sense  of  comfort  and\r\n\r\nrelief  for new arrivals from Hong Kong to turn to  and  help\r\n\r\nthem  quickly  integrate  into Singapore  society.  The  same\r\n\r\nshould  also  quickly  be done for others,  such  as  Chinese\r\n\r\nnationals and Indian foreign talents, if this is not  already\r\n\r\nin place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the frequent complaints I often hear from\r\n\r\nforeigners  living here is the lack of space and recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Hence, the NTUC's recent initiative in  building\r\n\r\na  $22  million theme park in Pasir Ris and the repositioning\r\n\r\nof  Sentosa  as  a  day  and night tourist  and  recreational\r\n\r\ndestination  are  encouraging.   I  know  for  a  fact   that\r\n\r\nCaucasians enjoy weekend getaways.  Hence, it would also help\r\n\r\nto freely disseminate information about weekend packages such\r\n\r\nas  escapades  to  the Riau Islands or Tioman,  these  places\r\n\r\nbeing just a couple of hours away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the exemption of the 90% granted to royalties\r\n\r\nfor  innovations  and  inventions in a  bid  to  attract  and\r\n\r\nencourage foreign talent to create new products in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe   new  tax  deductible  Special  Retirement  Scheme   for\r\n\r\nforeigners is an initiative in the right direction to  enable\r\n\r\nthem to reduce their tax burdens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel there is no better way though to attract top\r\n\r\ntalent here than to create an abundance of success stories as\r\n\r\nevidenced  by Silicon Valley and the Hshinchu's Science-based\r\n\r\npark  in  Taiwan.  We all must be familiar with  the  saying,\r\n\r\n\"success  breeds success.\" Doing all this and more will  help\r\n\r\nto  accelerate the creation of success stories which will  in\r\n\r\nturn help bring in the talent we need.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second topic is my concern about our youth's world\r\n\r\nreadiness.  I  can  still vividly recall the  headline  of  a\r\n\r\nStraits Times report less than two weeks ago which states  \"A\r\n\r\nwake-up  call  for  Singapore  youths.\"   In  spite  of   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  afflicting  Singapore  recently,   it   is\r\n\r\napparent  that our youths are shielded by their parents  and,\r\n\r\nas  the report noted, are stuck in a comfort zone where  they\r\n\r\nsaw no necessity to keep themselves abreast of the impact  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation and the borderless economy.  Our  young  people\r\n\r\nsaw  not  much of a need to seize opportunities  in  an  open\r\n\r\neconomy  where information, products and people  move  freely\r\n\r\nacross  national borders. They seem to be obsessed  with  the\r\n\r\nfeeling  that just because Singapore is tops in  many  areas,\r\n\r\nthere was little scope for them to learn from others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this, Sir, as a dangerous trend which needs to be\r\n\r\ngiven  urgent attention.  Such negative attitude and  narrow-mindedness  among  our  youths can only  spell  disaster  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  future, if not quickly corrected and  given  the\r\n\r\nright perspective to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the idea of a Ministry of Youth has been\r\n\r\nsuggested  as  unnecessary by Deputy Prime Minister,  BG  Lee\r\n\r\nHsien  Loong,  it  is imperative that the Government  focuses\r\n\r\nattention to this looming problem by setting up a body within\r\n\r\nan  appropriate Ministry to tackle the issue.   Perhaps,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore International Foundation could also be charged with\r\n\r\nthe   responsibility  to  design  overseas   attachment   and\r\n\r\ninternship programmes for a wider cross-section of our youths\r\n\r\nto  make  them  understand that there is much  more  to  just\r\n\r\nmaterial  success and help equip them with  a  more  balanced\r\n\r\nperspective of how they see the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the specific tax areas. I would like to\r\n\r\nfirst draw attention to the Finance Minister's segment of his\r\n\r\nspeech on the new economy where he cited  the important  need\r\n\r\nto  \"adopt a global mindset, innovate and advance with global\r\n\r\ntrends, or risk being rendered redundant\".  He went on to say\r\n\r\nthat  \"unless  we  are among the world's  best,  we  will  be\r\n\r\nrelegated  to  playing  a  peripheral  role  in  the   global\r\n\r\neconomy.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am glad that some enhancements were announced to\r\n\r\nsupport the technopreneurship drive, such as the estate  duty\r\n\r\nexemption   on  residential  properties  used  for   business\r\n\r\nactivities,  it is my hope to see the Employee  Stock  Option\r\n\r\nScheme (ESOP) creatively enhanced when it is announced in May\r\n\r\nthis year, which, hopefully, will trigger many more high-tech\r\n\r\nstart-ups.  Apart from motivating local investors to be  more\r\n\r\nadventurous  to put in their money in start-up  ventures,  it\r\n\r\nwill  also  help  to  bring us closer  to  a  Silicon  Valley\r\n\r\natmosphere  where talent from every nook and  corner  of  the\r\n\r\nworld flock, hoping to strike it rich through stock options.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technopreneurial ventures involve high risks. As such,\r\n\r\nit  would  augur  well for the Government to  send  a  strong\r\n\r\nsignal  that it is prepared to participate through incentives\r\n\r\nwhich would promote and motivate such ventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to take issue on group taxation,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been raised by several Members today and  in  the\r\n\r\npast.   This  is  where I feel we continue to fall  short  in\r\n\r\ncomparison to the advanced economies in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng, the Member for Cheng San GRC, and\r\n\r\nDr  Wang  Kai  Yuen, the Member for Bukit Timah, have  argued\r\n\r\nconvincingly  in last year's budget statement debate  of  the\r\n\r\nimportant need for us to seriously consider this move in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  our  rapid shift to a modern and knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.  This, coupled with the effect of globalisation  and\r\n\r\nmore  liberalised  measures initiated  by  the  international\r\n\r\ncommunity  aimed at converting the world into  one  monstrous\r\n\r\nmarketplace,  and with many of our companies now  plugged  to\r\n\r\nthis  marketplace,  is  making our territorial  principle  of\r\n\r\ntaxation  more and more irrelevant, and the absence of  group\r\n\r\ntaxation felt stronger than ever.  I sincerely hope that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance will review this in  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nkeeping pace with global trends and maintaining our relevance\r\n\r\nin the business world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is heartening to note a half percentage point\r\n\r\nreduction  on corporate tax, the gap for taxes on individuals\r\n\r\nis widening to 21/2%.  To prevent a trend of more individuals\r\n\r\ncorporatising  themselves  to  reap  the  benefit  of   lower\r\n\r\ncorporate tax rate, I would urge the Finance Minister to also\r\n\r\nlook into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which I think is in need of review is tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for  children.   With our declining  total  fertility\r\n\r\nrate,  which currently stands at less than 1.5,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nfind ways to increase birth rates and incentivise couples  to\r\n\r\nhave more children and bigger nuclear families.  In spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  special tax rebates of $20,000 extended for two to four-child families to set off against income tax, this has proven\r\n\r\nto  be an insufficient motivator for married couples to  bear\r\n\r\nmore children.  Singaporean couples want to give the best for\r\n\r\nevery  child  they bear and because of this high  expectation\r\n\r\nthey  have  set  for themselves, it pushes  up  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nbringing up children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of increasing the number of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  arresting our declining fertility rate, I would urge the\r\n\r\nMinister  to consider increasing the tax relief for  children\r\n\r\nas a motivator for Singaporeans to have more children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, our challenge is for Singapore to\r\n\r\ncontinually  differentiate ourselves from  the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nworld by finding ways and means to creatively harness and add\r\n\r\nvalue to both our hard and soft infrastructures that we  have\r\n\r\npainstakingly built.  The secret of Singapore's  success  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  that we were just responsive to the ever  changing\r\n\r\neconomic and political landscapes but always anticipating the\r\n\r\nchanges ahead.  We need to always keep it this way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the latest\r\n\r\nGovernment Budget.  I am particularly pleased with  the  $250\r\n\r\ntop-up of workers' CPF ordinary accounts and the rebates  for\r\n\r\nrentals  and  HDB  conservancy and  service  charges.   These\r\n\r\nbenefit workers and their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamilies directly and will be especially useful for those  in\r\n\r\nthe  low income group.  Other Singaporeans and those  in  the\r\n\r\nlow  income  group have also accepted the 10%  cut  from  the\r\n\r\nemployer's CPF contribution and wage cuts last year  to  pull\r\n\r\nSingapore  out  of  the recession.  It is painful  for  those\r\n\r\nearning low salaries to accept the cuts, but their sacrifices\r\n\r\nhave  not been in vain.  It helped companies to cut cost  and\r\n\r\nsaved many jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the number of retrenched workers fell to\r\n\r\n14,600, about half the figure of the previous year.   But  we\r\n\r\nmust not forget that less than half of Singaporeans above the\r\n\r\nage  of  40  have secondary and higher education.  They  were\r\n\r\nborn  before  1960.  At that time, we were living  under  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule.   We  grew  up  in  poverty.   There  was  no\r\n\r\nopportunity for us to learn English or to go to the secondary\r\n\r\nschool.  Therefore, this group of people did not receive good\r\n\r\neducation.  If this group of more than 800,000 people, or 42%\r\n\r\nof  our  total  workforce,  could not  upgrade  their  skills\r\n\r\nbecause  of  linguistic problems,  they are  likely  to  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs.  Many do not have computers at home or  at  work\r\n\r\nand  are  practically  IT-illiterate.   They  can  easily  be\r\n\r\nreplaced by younger and more computer-savvy employees who are\r\n\r\ncheaper to hire and are more trainable.  If these older folks\r\n\r\nlose  their  jobs,  they  will  have  no  income  to  support\r\n\r\nthemselves  and their families.  They will also lose  medical\r\n\r\nand other benefits provided by their previous employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $250 CPF top-up in the new Budget is a good way for\r\n\r\nthe Government to tell these Singaporean workers that this is\r\n\r\ngood  news for them.  It is a good way for the Government  to\r\n\r\ntell  them  that  it  cares  for them  and  appreciate  their\r\n\r\nsacrifices  during the recent recession.  It is also  a  good\r\n\r\nidea  for the Government to make these top-ups whenever there\r\n\r\nis  a  surplus  in the annual Budget.  Because of  their  low\r\n\r\nincome,  many workers do not pay income tax and therefore  do\r\n\r\nnot  enjoy tax reliefs.  With all these kind gestures on  the\r\n\r\npart  of the Government, it will be easier for the Government\r\n\r\nto  convince  them  to accept wage cuts if there  is  another\r\n\r\nrecession in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are other ways to reach out to the hearts and\r\n\r\nminds of the rank and file workers.  Many of them would  want\r\n\r\nto  know  when  they can get back the full  10%  cut  in  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions by employers.  The first restoration of 2% will\r\n\r\nbe  made on 1st April this year.  Will the next instalment be\r\n\r\nmade  next year if the economy grows by 4.5%-6.5% this  year,\r\n\r\nas expected by the Government?  If the growth is sustained in\r\n\r\nthis way, how long will it take for the Government to restore\r\n\r\nthe full 10% that was cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can also provide more funds to step up\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading  for those with low education  and  skills.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the years to come, when there is a budget surplus,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  could explore the idea of having  a  similar\r\n\r\n$250 CPF top-up but in a skills upgrading account instead, to\r\n\r\nencourage  our  workers  to use this fund  to  upgrade  their\r\n\r\nskills.   The Government can also consider giving more  funds\r\n\r\nto  Community Development Councils and town councils to  help\r\n\r\nretrenched workers and their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also urge the Government to revise certain\r\n\r\nlabour  laws  to  allow  trade unions  to  represent  casual,\r\n\r\ncontract  or part-time workers who are paid by the  companies\r\n\r\non  a project-by-project basis.  Tougher economic competition\r\n\r\nwill  force companies to downsize their workers to cut  cost.\r\n\r\nThis  trend will grow in future and those without the  skills\r\n\r\nneeded in the labour market may be forced to become casual or\r\n\r\npart-time  workers.   They  will move  from  one  project  to\r\n\r\nanother  without  getting  CPF  contributions  paid  by   the\r\n\r\nemployers.   When  they retire, they  will  have  no  CPF  or\r\n\r\nmedical savings to take care of their old age requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is marching into the 21st century. It will be\r\n\r\na  different  Singapore from that in the past century.   With\r\n\r\ntechnology   advances  and  the  Internet  revolution,   many\r\n\r\nexisting jobs and skills will become redundant.  But, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, new jobs requiring new knowledge and skills  will\r\n\r\nbe  created.  As such, it will be unavoidable that  the  wage\r\n\r\ngap  between the IT literates and those with lower  education\r\n\r\nand skills will widen.  Besides\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nurging  workers to change their mindsets to one of  life-long\r\n\r\nlearning  in order to surf on the wave of changes,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether there are any other plans to help those lower skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  adapt to these changes.   I think it is  timely  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to study these implications and to make extra\r\n\r\neffort to help these lower income earners keep pace with  the\r\n\r\nchange.   In  short,  this  is to help  them  increase  their\r\n\r\nincomes  so that they can enjoy a better standard of  living.\r\n\r\nSimply  put, the Government should think of ways to help  the\r\n\r\nlow income workers so that they will also be able to ride  on\r\n\r\nthe trend and to enjoy a higher standard of living.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  in  support of the motion as proposed  by  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister.   The  Budget for Financial  Year  2000  is  indeed\r\n\r\nprudent  and cautious.  Despite the difficult year  in  1999,\r\n\r\nthe Singapore economy has made a quick recovery to achieve  a\r\n\r\n5.4%  growth and have a budget surplus of about $3.2 billion.\r\n\r\nAs  highlighted by the Finance Minister, the financial crisis\r\n\r\nis largely behind us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $3.2 billion budget surplus has raised expectations.\r\n\r\nAs  a result, both the individuals and business community are\r\n\r\ndisappointed  when  not much rebates and tax  incentives  are\r\n\r\nproposed  in  the  Year 2000 Budget.  Many had  expected  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  to continue last year's  rebates  and  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  for one more year.  This would have  helped  more\r\n\r\nfirms  to  recover and more individuals to ride  out  of  the\r\n\r\ncrisis faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to address the concerns of individuals and the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community,  I  would like  to  make  the  following\r\n\r\nsuggestions for the Finance Minister to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Special CPF Top-up grant</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by the Finance Minister, the 10-percentage point cut in employer's CPF contribution and wage\r\n\r\nrestraint  in  1999  have  made a significant  difference  in\r\n\r\nincreasing our cost competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThus, the sacrifices made by workers have indeed helped firms\r\n\r\nto  turn around and contributed to the growth of our economy.\r\n\r\nIn  view of this, I feel that more rebates should be accorded\r\n\r\nto  our  workers  to recognise their efforts  in  helping  to\r\n\r\nrevive the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed special CPF top-up grant of $250 in the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account  is a token sum as compared  to  the  total\r\n\r\namount of CPF contribution loss suffered by the workers.  Let\r\n\r\nme illustrate the computation of this CPF loss.  Based on the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Statistics' household survey conducted in 1995,\r\n\r\nthe  median  monthly  household  income  is  $3,135.   A  10%\r\n\r\nemployer's   CPF  cut  will  result  in  the  loss   of   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  of $3,762.  Thus, the $250 special  CPF  top-up\r\n\r\ngrant only accounts for 6.6% of this loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have a budget surplus of $3.2 billion, I would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Finance Minister to be more generous and  grant  a\r\n\r\nhigher  CPF  top-up  grant  of $1,000  for  individuals.   To\r\n\r\nfurther   ensure   that  this  top-up  grant   will   benefit\r\n\r\nindividuals more effectively, we should allow CPF holders  to\r\n\r\ndecide  which account they would like to top up  in  the  CPF\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Ordinary,  Special, Medisave or  the  Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement Scheme account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Individual tax rebate</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister has highlighted that not all\r\n\r\nindustries  are  out  of the woods yet.  In  particular,  the\r\n\r\nconstruction business and financial sectors are  still  under\r\n\r\nperforming.  Similarly, not all Singaporeans are out  of  the\r\n\r\nwoods  from the financial crisis.  There are some  who  still\r\n\r\nface  difficulty  in finding jobs, servicing their  mortgages\r\n\r\nand   paying   for  their  living  expenses.   Although   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has implemented various measures to assist  these\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  there  are  some  who  still  need   financial\r\n\r\nassistance to overcome the financial crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have lost jobs experienced a drastic drop in\r\n\r\ntheir household income and may need time to retrain and  find\r\n\r\nother  suitable  jobs. During this transition  period,  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  undergo  a difficult period of financial  hardship.\r\n\r\nIn many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncases,  their  children's  studies  and  welfare  are   badly\r\n\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would propose that more incentives or subsidies be\r\n\r\ngiven  to those who make efforts to retrain and upgrade their\r\n\r\nskills.  Besides training grant, incentives such as CPF  top-up,  or  service and conservancy or utilities rebates can  be\r\n\r\nused  to alleviate the financial burden of these workers  and\r\n\r\nfacilitate  their upgrading efforts.  Without strong  support\r\n\r\nfrom the Government, these workers will find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nprioritise between family survival and skills upgrading.   In\r\n\r\naddition, more grants should be given to the CDCs or the CCCs\r\n\r\nto provide a safety net for these affected individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction sector is an industry that is closely\r\n\r\nrelated to many other industries due to its range of products\r\n\r\nand  services.  Its downturn has affected many industries and\r\n\r\nthe  jobs  of  many Singaporeans.  I welcome the increase  in\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure by 21.1% to $12.9 billion.  This will\r\n\r\nprovide  a  boost  to  the  construction  industry.   But,  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  proportion of this expenditure  is  on  physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure development such as Jurong island development,\r\n\r\nreclamation  of  Changi East, 5-year sewerage programme,  MRT\r\n\r\nand LRT system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these projects are complex and large in contract\r\n\r\nvalue.   The  scope  and  nature of these  projects  is  also\r\n\r\nlimited  to  very  few  building trades such  as  excavation,\r\n\r\nconcrete  and steel works.  As such, these projects  may  not\r\n\r\nprovide  much  impetus  to boost the  construction  industry.\r\n\r\nLocal  contractors  and suppliers may not benefit  from  such\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would urge the Finance Minister to consider\r\n\r\nincreasing the budget for more building projects such as MUP,\r\n\r\nIUP,  upgrading  of  existing schools,  construction  of  new\r\n\r\nschools and upgrading of sports complexes.  As stated in  the\r\n\r\nBudget,  only $188 million and $80 million are allocated  for\r\n\r\nMUP   and  IUP  respectively  this  year.   6,420  flats  are\r\n\r\nprojected to undergo MUP while 13,026 flats will start IUP.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of MUP and IUP, many HDB\r\n\r\nresidents have enjoyed the benefits of having a better living\r\n\r\nenvironment.  As these programmes are funded when there is  a\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus, we should expedite these programmes so  that\r\n\r\nmore  residents living in older estates can have their living\r\n\r\nenvironment  improved earlier.  Similarly, the Selective  En-Bloc  Redevelopment  Scheme should  be  expedited  so  as  to\r\n\r\nmaximise  land use and rejuvenate older housing  estates.  We\r\n\r\nshould also consider upgrading the public infrastructure  and\r\n\r\namenities in private estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Ministry of Community Development and\r\n\r\nSports  has  plans to make Singapore a sporting  nation.   To\r\n\r\nachieve  this  goal,  we should also  invest  in  the  sports\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  in our living environment.  Many  old  sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes and swimming pools must be rejuvenated to provide a\r\n\r\nwider  range  of facilities.  New sports facilities  must  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  to  encourage Singaporeans to take up  sports  and\r\n\r\nmaintain healthy lifestyles.  Therefore, it is necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to develop an upgrading programme for  sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes and swimming pools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>IT infrastructure upgrading grant</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of IT on businesses has surfaced new concerns\r\n\r\non  the suitability of building design of existing buildings.\r\n\r\nMany commercial and industrial buildings are not designed  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  IT  technologies.  As a  result,  companies  may\r\n\r\nincur high cost or loss in efficiency when they implement  IT\r\n\r\nin  their  existing  business premises.  Productive  time  of\r\n\r\nworkers  may be wasted due to the incompatibility of building\r\n\r\ndesign and IT infrastructure of the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported in the Straits Times today, some buildings\r\n\r\ncan  have  as much as two tonnes of unclaimed copper  in  the\r\n\r\nbuildings due to the change of tenants and frequent  rewiring\r\n\r\nof communication lines.  This will not only increase the cost\r\n\r\nof  maintenance but also the efficiency of the communications\r\n\r\nsystem in the buildings.  Therefore, in order to maximise the\r\n\r\npotential of IT, companies must be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencouraged  to upgrade their business premises  to  house  IT\r\n\r\ntechnologies appropriately.  Proper facilities planning  must\r\n\r\nbe incorporated to ensure that building design can facilitate\r\n\r\nbusiness processes or workflows in an IT working environment.\r\n\r\nThis will not only improve the morale of the workers but also\r\n\r\nincrease the productivity of our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would urge the Finance Minister to consider\r\n\r\nproviding  an IT infrastructure upgrading grant for  building\r\n\r\nowners  or  companies  that invest in  IT  infrastructure  to\r\n\r\nincrease their productivity and competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>CPF housing grant</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the tax changes to encourage Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nplan  prudently  for  their retirement  needs  and  encourage\r\n\r\ngreater family cohesiveness. To further encourage families to\r\n\r\nstay  together  or  close to each other, I  propose  that  we\r\n\r\nextend our present CPF housing grant for HDB first-timers  to\r\n\r\ninclude  all  Singaporeans who choose to purchase flats  near\r\n\r\ntheir  parents in the resale market.  Our housing policy  can\r\n\r\nalso  be  revised to allow HDB owners within the requisite  5\r\n\r\nyears'  occupation  period to move near their  parents.   But\r\n\r\nmeasures must be taken to ensure that such relocation is bona\r\n\r\nfide and fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Home Ownership Policy in Singapore has resulted\r\n\r\nin  the rapid nuclearisation of families over the years.  The\r\n\r\nprogressive development of New Towns and our Flat  Allocation\r\n\r\nPolicy has also caused many members of families to be located\r\n\r\nin  different  parts  of Singapore.   To  address  the  rapid\r\n\r\nwidespread of family nuclearisation, it is necessary for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  relook  into  its  housing   policy.    More\r\n\r\nflexibility  must  be  adopted  in  our  housing  policy   to\r\n\r\nencourage  families  to live close to one  another  within  a\r\n\r\ncommunity.   This  will provide much impetus  in  encouraging\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to age in-situ within the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with our fast ageing population, it is also\r\n\r\nnecessary to provide elderly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfriendly  infrastructure within the community.  Many existing\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  are not seamless and not  entirely  elderly\r\n\r\nfriendly.   For example, some external staircases  are  steep\r\n\r\nand   have  no  railings,  ramps  are  not  provided  or  are\r\n\r\ninconveniently located in some areas, not many vehicle  drop-off points are available near housing blocks, and there is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  lack  of  communal spaces  and  facilities  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Town Councils and Citizens' Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees  have been improving the housing estates,  limited\r\n\r\nfunding  is available to spearhead these initiatives to  make\r\n\r\nthe  towns  more elderly friendly.  Thus, I hope the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister can increase the allocated budget of $51 million for\r\n\r\nCommunity  Improvement Projects.  In this way, the  CCCs  and\r\n\r\nthe  Town  Councils  can  work  together  to  undertake  more\r\n\r\nimprovement projects for the benefit of our senior citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>World class companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT and globalisation have indeed put immense pressure\r\n\r\nfor companies in Singapore to increase their capabilities and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  To face these challenges, the  Committee on\r\n\r\nSingapore's Competitiveness has recommended that we  need  to\r\n\r\nbuild up a stable of our own world class companies with  core\r\n\r\ncompetencies,  which can compete effectively  in  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy.  Unfortunately, this year's budget does not  provide\r\n\r\nany  specific boost to nurture our own potential world  class\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Although there are various existing  schemes  in\r\n\r\nEDB  and PSB to help local companies, more support is  needed\r\n\r\nto  expand  these  schemes so that more local  firms  can  be\r\n\r\nnurtured to achieve world class standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is timely for the Government to re-examine\r\n\r\nthese  schemes and set appropriate benchmarks to measure  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  these schemes. The various approving authorities\r\n\r\nmust be given more mandate to take more risks to assist local\r\n\r\ncompanies'  ventures.  In addition, we  should  provide  more\r\n\r\nflexibility  and easier access for such companies  to  obtain\r\n\r\ngrant or financing to strengthen their core capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies that produce global products should be given\r\n\r\nspecial  tax  incentives to venture into the  global  market.\r\n\r\nThe  Government can also provide more support to  help  these\r\n\r\npotential  world  class  companies  market  and  brand  their\r\n\r\nproducts or services globally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further assist these firms to attract and retain\r\n\r\ntalented  staff, companies must be given more tax  incentives\r\n\r\nto package their remuneration system.  For example, we should\r\n\r\nallow personal tax exemption for staff benefits such as  car,\r\n\r\nhousing,  club,  etc.    To be able to  attract  world  class\r\n\r\ntalent,  we must offer world class remuneration packages.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  Government  can  play  a  significant  role  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate   the  recruitment  of  world  class   talent   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  will increase the chances  of  success  in\r\n\r\nproducing world class companies in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br>6.43 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for allowing me to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak in support of the motion in the\r\n\r\nname of the Minister for Finance.  After a long day where  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues have given so much of the bird's eye\r\n\r\nand fish eye view of things in this budget, I would just like\r\n\r\nto  focus  on  one  particular topic, ie,  the  Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement  Scheme (SRS).  The Minister intends  to  initiate\r\n\r\nsome  tax changes in order to encourage Singaporeans to  save\r\n\r\nmore  prudently  for  their needs after  retirement,  and  to\r\n\r\nencourage greater family cohesiveness, particularly  in  view\r\n\r\nof  the  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on  Ageing  Population\r\n\r\nReport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This \"complementary private sector system\" is to\r\n\r\nencourage individuals to contribute to a private fund such as\r\n\r\nunder  the \"Supplementary Retirement Scheme\".  It is proposed\r\n\r\nthat  the SRS will be accorded tax deductions at the time  of\r\n\r\ncontribution, but the tax being payable only when the savings\r\n\r\nare  withdrawn.   The Minister said that the  percentage  cap\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  salary will be determined.  In view  of  this\r\n\r\nprospective  ageing  population, and  the  higher  dependency\r\n\r\nratio\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  we  are going to face in the next 10 years, I urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  consider  immediately  giving  some  leeway  to\r\n\r\ntaxpayers who would also like to save under the SRS for their\r\n\r\naged parents who may be either working or retired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans retired on very small retirement\r\n\r\nsavings  because our country was quite poor  in  its  initial\r\n\r\nstages  of  our  economic development, and the  country  went\r\n\r\nthrough  a very dramatic growth era, from ground zero  within\r\n\r\none  generation.  Just now, my parliamentary colleague Mr Ong\r\n\r\nAh  Heng  from the NTUC has just given an example of  how  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  huge  group,  40% of our labour  force,  of  800,000\r\n\r\nworkers  without  Secondary Four education.   This  group  of\r\n\r\npeople at that time did not have this opportunity, because we\r\n\r\nwere under a colonial administration, as he had aptly put it.\r\n\r\nAnd because of this, their earning capacity and income stream\r\n\r\nall  through their life were quite low.  So even if we had  a\r\n\r\nCPF  scheme during the period when they were working for  the\r\n\r\nlast  20  to  30 years, the amount saved is quite  small  for\r\n\r\nthese workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A SRS Scheme for aged parents, with an appropriate tax\r\n\r\noffset,  ought  to be incorporated.  The Minister  may  reply\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  already in existence an allowance  for  aged\r\n\r\nparents  supported by a taxpaying son or daughter.  But  this\r\n\r\ntax  relief is only limited to one taxpaying son or daughter.\r\n\r\nHe  may also say that there is now already a Minimum Sum top-up to the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I support my colleague, Dr Wang Kai Yuen's\r\n\r\nsuggestion  to raise this Minimum Sum top-up to  $60,000  for\r\n\r\nall.   But  I am more concerned also with extending this  SRS\r\n\r\nscheme  to aged parents as well.  I believe this is quite  an\r\n\r\nurgent  task.   The sooner we do this the better  because  it\r\n\r\ntakes time for some reasonable accumulation of savings to  be\r\n\r\neffectively  useful.   It makes possible  a  kind  of  inter-generational  transfer of income with some tax  incentive  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  I hope we do not have to wait  for  another\r\n\r\nfive  or 10 years to discover that the Minimum Sum top-up  is\r\n\r\nnot enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will seriously look into the\r\n\r\nwidening of the SRS scheme now to allow taxpayers with income\r\n\r\nto transfer some savings to their aged parents through such a\r\n\r\nscheme.  They should get full tax offset on this, up to  some\r\n\r\ngenerous cap, and I mean generous, bearing in mind the longer\r\n\r\nlifespan of people in the next 10 to 20 years.  We need to do\r\n\r\nthis  now  as  soon as possible.  Although we  have  our  CPF\r\n\r\nscheme  for  many years, the truth is that many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill not be fully prepared for their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax relief the Minister offers now will pay off in\r\n\r\nlessening the burden of a large number of such aged  who  are\r\n\r\ninadequately funded for retirement.  A positive step now will\r\n\r\nadd  to  building a cohesive bond between the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, many people told me that\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  this year is not exciting at  all.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising  because  this  Budget was  pronounced  after  the\r\n\r\nseries of supplementary measures announced last year.  It  is\r\n\r\nnow  the  time  to adjust to new conditions.   Some  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  were  necessary last year would not be necessary  this\r\n\r\nyear.  So there should be a period of adjustment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures abolished were not many. The 10% corporate\r\n\r\ntax  rebate has been replaced by 0.5% reduction in  corporate\r\n\r\ntax.   The  exemption  of property tax for  properties  under\r\n\r\ndevelopment was withdrawn.  These two big measures show  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is quite optimistic about the recovery of our\r\n\r\neconomy.   The  Minister also mentioned that the construction\r\n\r\nindustry is still in the doldrums.  However, I feel that  the\r\n\r\nreduction of the tax rebate on developments from 55%  to  25%\r\n\r\nhappened too soon.  The construction industry has a share  of\r\n\r\n10%  in  our  GDP.   The long term negative  growth  of  this\r\n\r\nindustry would affect quite a lot of people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMany  people  in  this  industry are  facing  bankruptcy  and\r\n\r\nbecoming  insolvent.  If the Government does not do  anything\r\n\r\nto help the construction industry, this industry will take  a\r\n\r\nmuch  longer  time to revive.  To withdraw the  property  tax\r\n\r\nexemption  for  the  property  under  development  will  have\r\n\r\nnegative impact on the construction industry.  We should make\r\n\r\nuse  of  these measures to stimulate the property  sector  so\r\n\r\nthat they can be restored to their former prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of corporate tax from 26% to 25.5% would\r\n\r\nimply  that there will be some adjustments in personal income\r\n\r\ntax in future.  Right now the 5% rebate in income tax is more\r\n\r\npreferred.   However,  I  feel  that  there  should   be   an\r\n\r\nadjustment  in  the personal income tax rate  so  that  there\r\n\r\nshould not be too big a difference between corporate tax rate\r\n\r\nand personal income tax rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things which merit our support. In the\r\n\r\nallocation  of  funds for MCD, there is an  increase  of  38%\r\n\r\nwhich  shows  that  the  Government is  concerned  about  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  of  social  cohesiveness  as  proposed  in  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address.  The proposed Supplementary  Retirement\r\n\r\nScheme  is  a  good  suggestion.  The  increase  in  the  tax\r\n\r\nreduction  for  the  aged  parents and  the  top-up  for  the\r\n\r\nparents' CPF  show that the Government has taken note of  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  an ageing population in our society.   I  think\r\n\r\nfamilies  are the best places to look after the aged parents.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  big increase in other social and community  funding\r\n\r\nalso shows that the Government pays attention to the personal\r\n\r\nrelationship   between   the  people   and   the   harmonious\r\n\r\nrelationship  between the different communities.   This  will\r\n\r\nalso  strengthen other social amenities like  homes  for  the\r\n\r\naged,  childcare  centres  and  other  measures.   This  will\r\n\r\nalleviate the problems of working mothers and the problems of\r\n\r\naged  parents who need people to look after them.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  increased funding for MCD will help to raise the quality\r\n\r\nof life and the cohesiveness of the society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget encourages young people and foster the spirit\r\n\r\nof entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  measures such as the reduction in estate duties and  tax\r\n\r\nexemption   for  royalty  for  intellectual  properties   are\r\n\r\npositive measures for encouraging entrepreneurship.  However,\r\n\r\non  the  other hand, there is this scheme called the employee\r\n\r\nstock option scheme.  The tax levied on this scheme, I think,\r\n\r\nis  not  very  appropriate.  We should  understand  that  the\r\n\r\ncapital  gain from the acquisition of shares is not  taxable.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  a  stock  option scheme  is  aimed  at  retaining\r\n\r\nemployees so that they have a stake in the company  in  order\r\n\r\nto  motivate  them to work better and longer  hours  for  the\r\n\r\ncompany.  After they have opted for the shares, there  is  an\r\n\r\nappreciation in the share values.  Why should they  be  taxed\r\n\r\non  the gains of the shares which they are allocated?   These\r\n\r\nshares   allocated  to  the  employees  will   have   certain\r\n\r\nconditions  attached.  For example, the value of  the  shares\r\n\r\nwill   be   based  on  the  market  value  at  the  time   of\r\n\r\nannouncement.  And there is a limit in the period before they\r\n\r\ncan  take out the shares.  If the gains from these shares are\r\n\r\ntaxable, they will have to sell their shares to pay for their\r\n\r\nincome  tax.   This will defeat the purpose of  the  employee\r\n\r\nstock  option  scheme, and the employees will suffer  certain\r\n\r\nlosses  because it may not be the right time  to  sell  their\r\n\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many young entrepreneurs have many ways to make money\r\n\r\nbut  they are short of funds.  Therefore, through this  stock\r\n\r\noption  scheme,  the  young  entrepreneurs  could  acquire  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  portion of the share in the  company  where  his\r\n\r\nidea  is  implemented.  The benefits accrued are the same  as\r\n\r\nthose shareholders who founded the company.  To levy taxes on\r\n\r\nthe   shares   under  the  stock  option   scheme   will   be\r\n\r\ncontradictory  to  the  aim  of  the  scheme   in   promoting\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  I hope the authorities will take  note  of\r\n\r\nthis.  I personally do not agree to the levying of tax on the\r\n\r\nstocks under this scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Budget last year, the Budget benefits many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  especially those who are in the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup.  In this tax package, those who are above 21 years old\r\n\r\nwill  be  given $250 CPF top-up.  This is a very good measure\r\n\r\nto make them feel that the people of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  have a stake in our economic prosperity.   Through\r\n\r\nvarious  tax rebates, for example, in the case of  4-roomers,\r\n\r\nthey  will get a minimum of $683 as rebates and top-up.   For\r\n\r\nthose earning higher income they would be getting as much  as\r\n\r\n$1,138  in the form of rebates and top up.  Many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbenefit from this Budget.  I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I stand to urge the Ministry of Finance help chart  the\r\n\r\nfuture work of the Ministry of Health in a new direction  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  better of healthcare in Singapore.  It is  a  known\r\n\r\nfact  that  the right allocation of funds will determine  the\r\n\r\nadvancement  of  certain  desired  outcome.   Sir,  the   new\r\n\r\ndirection I would like the Ministry of Health to go  in  this\r\n\r\nnew  millennium calls for a greater integration of the public\r\n\r\nand  private  medical  sectors in  Singapore.   This  is  far\r\n\r\nremoved  from  the  type of integration  that  we  have  been\r\n\r\nstressing  on  -  the  vertical integration  between  primary\r\n\r\nthrough  to  tertiary services and facilities all within  the\r\n\r\npublic sector only.  What we need to look into is the lateral\r\n\r\nintegration,  say, between the polyclinics  and  the  private\r\n\r\ngeneral   practices,  between  specialists  in   restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals   and  those  in  private  practice   and   between\r\n\r\nrestructured and private hospitals, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do contend that there is already a little integration\r\n\r\nin  our  health  system at the moment.  The  Health  Ministry\r\n\r\nallows  private doctors to come back as visiting  consultants\r\n\r\nto teach and to impart experiences to the younger doctors.  A\r\n\r\nset  of  scheme under the Ministry of Health has  specialists\r\n\r\nproviding services in hospital departments that are short  in\r\n\r\nsuch  expertise.   The  Health Ministry taps  expertise  from\r\n\r\nprivate  sectors  with the setting up of specialist  centres.\r\n\r\nAmong doctors, collaboration for complicated procedures, such\r\n\r\nas  open  heart  surgery or liver transplant, is  common  and\r\n\r\nfairly routine.  There is, however, a distinct and disturbing\r\n\r\ndivide  between  the  private and public medical  sectors  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   And, Sir, this divide is and will  always  be  a\r\n\r\ndilemma for healthcare here.  BG George\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nYeo,  when  he was Minister for Health, supported the  notion\r\n\r\nfor  greater  integration of the public and private  sectors.\r\n\r\nIntegrate  these two sectors and we may even  achieve  global\r\n\r\nrecognition as being one of the best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staying on with BG George Yeo, he mentioned that he had\r\n\r\nvisited the Mayo Clinic at Rochester in Minnesota.  He  noted\r\n\r\nthat  Rochester  was  a  small  town  of  less  than  100,000\r\n\r\ninhabitants,  in the middle of nowhere and has  beastly  cold\r\n\r\nwinter  four  to  five months a year.  But it  has  the  most\r\n\r\nwonderful medical facilities in the whole world.  And because\r\n\r\nit  serves  the  rich and famous from around the  world,  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  Rochester  enjoy a  quality  of  healthcare  not\r\n\r\npossible for any other prairie town of 100,000 in America  or\r\n\r\nin  the world.  He said that in the same way, if we were able\r\n\r\nto establish Singapore as a \"Mayo Clinic in South East Asia\",\r\n\r\nthen  all of us who happen to live in Singapore will enjoy  a\r\n\r\nquality  of medical care far surpassing what a population  of\r\n\r\nthree million would otherwise deserve.  Singapore will  be  a\r\n\r\n\"Mayo Clinic in South East Asia\", Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, and\r\n\r\nthe way towards achieving this is through the integration  of\r\n\r\nour public and private medical sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a change of direction towards integration\r\n\r\nrather  than  maintaining division.   Singapore  is  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry  with a small population; we must derive our strength\r\n\r\nthrough  unity.   We  must remove the  unnecessary  waste  of\r\n\r\nenergy  on  competing and bickering amongst  ourselves.   Our\r\n\r\nenergy  should  be used to put all our resources  to  maximal\r\n\r\nuse.   In the past, the Government's policy has been to  rely\r\n\r\non  competition and market forces to keep health  cost  down.\r\n\r\nSir, we need a mindset change now; these are different times.\r\n\r\nWe  must look at things globally and we are doing in so  many\r\n\r\naspects of our forward planning.  Our healthcare plans should\r\n\r\nbe  included  in  this overture and I am suggesting  that  we\r\n\r\nquickly  do  away  with  the divide between  the  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate sectors of our healthcare system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to give ten reasons\r\n\r\nto  emphasise  the importance of integrating the  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate  medical sectors in Singapore.  I am sorry I have  to\r\n\r\nhold you back, my colleagues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Singapore is a small country; an integrated system\r\n\r\nwill lead to maximisation of potential in the medical arena.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The public and private sectors should work together\r\n\r\nto plan facilities more efficiently.  Integration will reduce\r\n\r\nduplication  of  facilities, in terms of expensive  equipment\r\n\r\nsuch as the gamma knife, etc, in the two sectors.  Sir, there\r\n\r\nis  certainly  no necessity for duplication of facilities  in\r\n\r\ncertain  highly  specialised fields  of  medicine  where  the\r\n\r\npatient pool in the country is limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) It is more sensible to maximise the use of our\r\n\r\nhealthcare personnel.  For instance, the experts in the  very\r\n\r\nspecialised fields like liver transplants should  be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  operate  in both sectors because there is  really  not  a\r\n\r\nsufficient  pool  of  patients from our population  of  three\r\n\r\nmillion  to  support these areas in the  divide  of  the  two\r\n\r\nsectors.    Another   example  is   to   make   the   private\r\n\r\npractitioners look after a portion of the \"subsidy  patients\"\r\n\r\nand   ease   the  load  in  the  polyclinics  and  specialist\r\n\r\noutpatient clinics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Patients will stand to benefit from integration of\r\n\r\nthe   two  sectors  because  there  will  be  more  equitable\r\n\r\navailability  of  quality care.  The  costs  will  be  better\r\n\r\ncontained and the wait times will be less lengthy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Both private and public sectors could work together\r\n\r\nto  develop Singapore into a Regional Medical Hub.  Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the two sectors should not be in conflict  but\r\n\r\nshould  be  in synergism, or Singapore will lose the  leading\r\n\r\nedge  over  the  neighbouring  countries.   As  it  is,  many\r\n\r\noverseas  patients are now finding Penang to be a  very  good\r\n\r\nalternative  place  to  seek medical  treatment  in  lieu  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Integration will restrain the exodus of specialists\r\n\r\nfrom  the  public  to the private sectors, especially  during\r\n\r\ngood economic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntimes.  This will prevent uneven spread of talent.  This will\r\n\r\nalso   bring  earnings  of  doctors  in  both  sectors   more\r\n\r\ncomparable with one another and stem one of the major reasons\r\n\r\nfor the outflow of doctors to the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Training of young doctors will get a boost from the\r\n\r\nactive   participation  of  private  doctors,  both   general\r\n\r\npractitioners and specialists.  Sir, there are  many  private\r\n\r\npractitioners who love teaching and are, indeed, very good at\r\n\r\nit.   Training young doctors should therefore be  seen  as  a\r\n\r\nnational concern, involving doctors from both sectors, as  it\r\n\r\nis   a   \"very  specialised,  time-consuming  and  expensive\"\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Doctors can learn from each other when more\r\n\r\ncollaborative  work  becomes  possible  through  integration.\r\n\r\nThey  will learn when they work together and get to  see  and\r\n\r\ntreat more complicated cases that they may not otherwise meet\r\n\r\nindividually.  This will further fine-tune the skills of  our\r\n\r\ndoctors,  and  thus get closer towards our  aim  of  being  a\r\n\r\nregional medical hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) With the healthcare system integrated, both doctors\r\n\r\nand patients will benefit.  Specialists from both sectors can\r\n\r\nbe  called in to treat local and foreign patients, especially\r\n\r\nin  areas  of  super-specialisation.  Super-specialists  will\r\n\r\nthen  get  more  patients to hone and improve  their  skills.\r\n\r\nPatients, whether local or foreign, will benefit because they\r\n\r\nwill  get to be treated by the best in each field and from  a\r\n\r\nwider base of doctors and specialists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Our talent pool is unnecessarily segregated and\r\n\r\nrestricted in their respective positions in the two  sectors.\r\n\r\nMany  doctors  will  have the chance for  research  work  and\r\n\r\nteaching as well as to have a private practice if their  more\r\n\r\ndispensable  roles can be shared out amongst more colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe private practitioners, in the present system, can lighten\r\n\r\nthe  workload of Government doctors if allowed to work in the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  as  visiting  consultants,  treat  subsidised\r\n\r\npatients and impart their skills to the younger doctors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we should look at some of the\r\n\r\nbasic  steps  that must be adopted to bring about integration\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Unless the Government is serious about integration\r\n\r\nof  the  public and private sectors and actively promote  it,\r\n\r\nall  efforts  in  this  ideology will not  come  about.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment, therefore, must be even handed in all aspects  of\r\n\r\nits  handling  of  the private and the  public  sectors.   It\r\n\r\nshould  be  concerned  about the well-being  of  the  private\r\n\r\nsector also.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Government must be seen to be committed towards\r\n\r\nbringing  about  this  change.  The appropriate  funding  and\r\n\r\nincentives provided by the Finance Ministry will  be  a  good\r\n\r\nstart.   The correct directives must also come down from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health to all public medical sector and  private\r\n\r\nmedical sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There must be a paradigm shift of mindset of all\r\n\r\ndoctors in Singapore to work as one in synergism and  not  in\r\n\r\ncompetition, to aim to become a regional medical hub for  the\r\n\r\ngood of the country and the people.  Without this basic shift\r\n\r\nin  mindset,  even all the favourable areas  in  our  present\r\n\r\nhealthcare system will sadly go to waste.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Many schemes must be structured properly by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health.   For example, the visiting  consultant\r\n\r\nscheme  must  be structured by an objective panel  so  as  to\r\n\r\noptimise  the  benefits.   Prime  Minister  Goh  did  suggest\r\n\r\npreviously that this scheme should be enhanced and called  on\r\n\r\nmore  private  specialists to contribute  their  services  to\r\n\r\nGovernment hospitals as visiting consultants.  At the moment,\r\n\r\nthis scheme cannot be enhanced because it lacks the directive\r\n\r\nfrom  the Ministry of Health.  Private doctors have to depend\r\n\r\non  friendship  and  courtesy of their colleagues  in  public\r\n\r\nhospitals  to be invited as visiting consultants.  Some  feel\r\n\r\nredundant  and  unwelcome even after being  offered  visiting\r\n\r\nconsultant   posts.   To  succeed,  this   scheme   must   be\r\n\r\nstructured,  with the appointments made by a panel  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  and  a  clear programme drawn up to  optimise  the\r\n\r\nvisiting consultants' time in public hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Fuller cooperation by the private sector must be\r\n\r\nforthcoming, for example, to accredit Government  specialists\r\n\r\nas  consultants  to  private hospitals.   Government  doctors\r\n\r\ncould  be allowed to work in primary healthcare set-ups  such\r\n\r\nas general practice clinics.  In other words, let us evolve a\r\n\r\nsystem  where  the cross-borders between public  and  private\r\n\r\nsectors are less distinct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this new directive, if adopted,\r\n\r\nwill  bring  medical healthcare in Singapore to even  greater\r\n\r\nheights.   This  opportunity to maximise our present  medical\r\n\r\nhealthcare system should be harnessed quickly and  fully.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  beseech our Government to proceed immediately  for\r\n\r\ngreater integration of the public and private medical sectors\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br>7.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, like many other\r\n\r\ncitizens,  I  am  very  pleased  with  Singapore's   V-shaped\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery and proud of the way in which Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  banded together, accepted cuts in CPF and faced  global\r\n\r\ncompetition by adjusting to increasing liberalisation of  key\r\n\r\nsectors  of  our  economy. We have taken the  Asian  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  by  its horns and rode the tidal waves  in  the  last\r\n\r\nthree  years,  coming up stronger, as the  sterling  economic\r\n\r\nresults presented before us by the Minister have exemplified.\r\n\r\nI  would like first to thank and commend the Minister and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  the skilful steering of our  economy  as  we\r\n\r\nemerge from the wood of the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we enter into the new millennium, the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  rightly  pointed  out that the terms  of  reference  for\r\n\r\nglobal   economic  competition  have  altered  significantly.\r\n\r\nGlobalisation and the onslaught of technological  advancement\r\n\r\nhave  altered the way markets operate and the nature of doing\r\n\r\nbusiness  altogether.   We do indeed  need  to  innovate  and\r\n\r\nadvance with global trends or risk being rendered redundant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional brick and mortar enterprises are being\r\n\r\nreplaced  daily by virtual dot.com businesses.   Indeed,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  two  months of the new millennium saw  the  Dow  Jones\r\n\r\nfalling  17% from its peak in a rather short period of  time,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  technology heavy NASDAQ doubling since  September\r\n\r\n1999  and seems to rise irrespective of whether there is  any\r\n\r\nintervention in the money markets via interest rates  by  the\r\n\r\nFED.   What this boils down to in essence is that there is  a\r\n\r\nclear  diversion of capital to the new technologies, the  new\r\n\r\nmethods of doing business or the new era of competition  that\r\n\r\nlies before us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to express my concerns\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Budget  caters enough to  enable  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nembark on the genesis of this knowledge-based economy of  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   My  concern transcends beyond the simple allocation\r\n\r\nof  a budget for IT across the Ministries.  It is essentially\r\n\r\nwhether  we have provided enough across the entire  budgetary\r\n\r\nsystem  and  framework, to incentivise, to  motivate  and  to\r\n\r\nsupport a strategy of the new knowledge economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has indeed tried to position Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  these  new  challenges.  I note  that  there  have  been\r\n\r\nconcerted efforts to roll out IT education programmes in  our\r\n\r\nschools  and  to  \"wire\" Singapore up. The NSTB  is  also  in\r\n\r\nreceipt   of   development  expenditure  for  financing   and\r\n\r\nadministering R&D projects in addition to the various schemes\r\n\r\nalready  in  place  to co-support IT start-ups.   Its  recent\r\n\r\nlaunch  of  the  portal for technopreneurs  in  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate and support budding dot.com companies  is  also  a\r\n\r\nstep in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal incentives in the budget for innovation, as well\r\n\r\nas   the  estate  duty  exemption  extended  to  support  the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneur  Home Office Scheme, are all encouraging  signs\r\n\r\nthat the Government is positioning Singapore for the new age.\r\n\r\nHowever, this begs the question of whether more can  be  done\r\n\r\nin  the  shortest  possible  time as  we  quickly  reposition\r\n\r\nourselves to face the KBE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, at the macro level, through belt tightening and\r\n\r\nthe cost of restructuring,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  was  felt  by many at the individual job  loss  level,\r\n\r\nSingapore has been able to run budget surpluses in  the  last\r\n\r\ntwo  financial  years, to the tune of $4.2  billion  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  rightly decided to pass a  portion  back  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans via a $250 CPF top-up. I wonder whether part  of\r\n\r\nthis  surplus could be passed on to Singaporeans to get  them\r\n\r\nto prepare for the knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may sound radical at this juncture but we may\r\n\r\nneed  to be courageous as we enter the brave new world ahead.\r\n\r\nThe  Communications and IT Ministry has recently announced  a\r\n\r\n$25  million scheme to finance IT courses. This would,  as  a\r\n\r\nstart, underline the commitment and the fundamental strategic\r\n\r\ndirection that the Government has for Singapore to compete in\r\n\r\nthe  new environment. This programme would be a basic enabler\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the vast majority of our workforce  or  every\r\n\r\nsingle  family is IT equipped and can then start  to  embrace\r\n\r\nand  take full advantage of the KBE.  It is indeed a laudable\r\n\r\nmove.   However, I believe the $25 million, averaged  over  a\r\n\r\nworkforce  of 1.5 million Singaporeans works out to  $16  per\r\n\r\nperson, may not be enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a start, I would like to propose that perhaps a\r\n\r\nmatching  amount  for the CPF top-up of $250  per  person  be\r\n\r\nchannelled  through  the CDC to co-fund IT  courses  or  even\r\n\r\nbasic hardware purchases like PCs by families as part of  the\r\n\r\nlife-long learning initiatives.  Furthermore, I would propose\r\n\r\nthat the Minister consider a scheme whereby we devote some 10-15%  of our annual budget surpluses to be ploughed back  into\r\n\r\nthe  economy  through the CDC to upgrade and to  prepare  our\r\n\r\npopulation for the KBE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more substantial than the mere $25 million\r\n\r\nearmarked  by  the Ministry of Communications  and  IT.  This\r\n\r\nprogramme  would  help ensure that the vast majority  of  our\r\n\r\nworkforce  or even every single household is IT equipped  and\r\n\r\ncan  then  start  to embrace and take full advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nglobal  KBE.   This  method of involving  the  CDCs  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  groups  is  also  consistent  with  our   aim   of\r\n\r\nencouraging ownership and self-reliance,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  keeping with the objectives of Singapore 21, and would go\r\n\r\na   significant  step  to  reach  out  to  our  families  and\r\n\r\ncommunities to influence their mindset and culture.  This  is\r\n\r\nespecially   applicable   to  the   middle-aged   and   older\r\n\r\ngenerations, a vast number of whom still have an innate  fear\r\n\r\nof  technology and have felt left behind by the fast changing\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of concern is the comparatively few firm\r\n\r\ninitiatives    to    support    the    entrepreneurial     or\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurial  society that we envisage  for  the  future.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  has emphasised that the review  for  the  ESOP\r\n\r\nscheme would be completed in May this year. We recognise  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of how stock options are essential  to  start-ups\r\n\r\nand  mature corporations in this new environment to  recruit,\r\n\r\nmotivate and retain top talent.  Indeed, equity ownership  is\r\n\r\nthe  key  to  the  development of a vibrant  technopreneurial\r\n\r\nenvironment  in  Silicon  Valley and  other  high-tech  nodes\r\n\r\nelsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, time is of the essence in respect of creating a\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurial society.  Hence, I would urge  the  Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider hastening the process as this tax review on  the\r\n\r\nESOP  scheme has been on-going in Singapore for a  number  of\r\n\r\nyears  now, whilst other countries such as the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nand Japan have gone ahead and revised their policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to improve on our modest first step which\r\n\r\nwas to enhance the tax treatment of ESOP by deferring the tax\r\n\r\npayable by up to five years announced last year, I would like\r\n\r\nto  suggest  a  bolder  extension. To  really  make  the  tax\r\n\r\ntreatment for ESOP scheme more favourable than cash payments,\r\n\r\nperhaps  an easy to administer scheme would be to charge  all\r\n\r\nincome  derived from share options exercised and  sold  at  a\r\n\r\nflat rate of 3%.  This could be a spur to allow companies  to\r\n\r\nincentivise  their employees and partners in enterprise,  and\r\n\r\nis  also  in  line with our attempt to encourage  basic  wage\r\n\r\nflexibility as well as a more risk-taking culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly on fiscal policies, we note that many younger\r\n\r\ngeneration  IT savvy potential entrepreneurs are  lacking  in\r\n\r\nfunds to support their good ideas. While\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere are various schemes in place at the NSTB, we still have\r\n\r\na   large   number  of  successful  Singapore  technopreneurs\r\n\r\nobtaining funding from angel investors in Singapore.   May  I\r\n\r\nfurther suggest that the Minister consider tax incentives for\r\n\r\nthese  angel investors, such as the ability to offset venture\r\n\r\ninvestment  losses  in such hi-tech start-ups  against  their\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax, as a catalyst to encourage  more  risk-taking  by  our people and to spur the private sector  growth\r\n\r\nfor angel investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the knowledge-based economy of the\r\n\r\nfuture,  there  are  employment trends in the  United  States\r\n\r\nshowing an increasing growth of part-time and contract  jobs.\r\n\r\nThese  are  created  as a result of the outsourcing  of  many\r\n\r\naspects  of  a  traditional firm, from project  work,  supply\r\n\r\nchain management, IT to human resource management.  Firms are\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  lean  and  mean  and  efficient  to   compete\r\n\r\neffectively.   This trend is not isolated and  the  model  is\r\n\r\napplicable  to  the  KBE of the future.   Indeed,  there  are\r\n\r\nalready  signs in Singapore that our companies  are  adopting\r\n\r\nsuch methods to stay nimble and competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upshot to this trend is that permanent work or full-time employment is on the decline and that self-employment\r\n\r\nand  part-time  work  are  on the  increase.  This  increased\r\n\r\nincidence  of flexi-work is consistent with a KBE and  should\r\n\r\nbe   supported   especially  in  the  light   of   increasing\r\n\r\nderegulation of our services sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are implications that we have to cater\r\n\r\nfor.   We  have  to encourage individuals to  be  more  self-reliant  and responsible for their own well-being  since  the\r\n\r\nera  of  life-long employment is on the decline.  I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister  has  announced  the  introduction  of  a\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Retirement  Scheme  (SRS)  which  would  allow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to contribute voluntarily over and  above  their\r\n\r\nCPF  savings  which would be accorded tax deductions  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of contribution. However, I would urge the Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider extending the SRS in two areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the percentage cap for tax deductibility for\r\n\r\nemployees'  CPF contributions could be set at a higher  level\r\n\r\nso  that employees have greater flexibility to maximise their\r\n\r\nlong-term  interest via the CPF.  Secondly, to encourage  the\r\n\r\ngreater use of CPF accounts and ancillary benefits, I suggest\r\n\r\nan  equivalent  scheme be extended to the  self-employed  and\r\n\r\nthose who are employed on non-CPF schemes, particularly those\r\n\r\npart-timers and contract workers, to also contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nCPF  in  such  like  manner.  In the KBE  that  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ntransforming itself into, there would be a greater number  of\r\n\r\nself-employed,   contract  staff  as   well   as   home-based\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs and technopreneurs who would benefit from  this\r\n\r\nmeasure.  This would enable the Government to encourage  more\r\n\r\npersonal  responsibilities and less reliance on the state  as\r\n\r\nwe move forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, with the trends in new forms of work and\r\n\r\nemployment,  I  would  suggest that the Government  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to take up private insurance. The tax  deduction\r\n\r\nfor  life  insurance premiums is currently limited  for  most\r\n\r\nindividuals who have regular CPF contributions.  To encourage\r\n\r\ngreater  self-dependency and personal  responsibilities,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  consider  lifting  this  cap  and   allow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to use their CPF to buy health,  education  and\r\n\r\nother forms of life insurance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a critical aspect to the success of\r\n\r\nSingapore in the new globally competitive IT intensive future\r\n\r\nis  to influence the culture and mindset of Singaporeans.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  change our traditional expectations of what working\r\n\r\nlife  or  what  a job is like. We have to become  less  risk-averse,  more entrepreneurial and more IT enabled.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  aspects are already enshrined in Singapore  21  goals,\r\n\r\nwhere  we should leverage on the strengths of family and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  not merely let loose unbridled individualism.\r\n\r\nI  am  glad that the Minister has continued to extend  fiscal\r\n\r\nincentives  that are supportive of the family.
