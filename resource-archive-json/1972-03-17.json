This  Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nestablish   a   statutory  board  known   as   the\r\n\r\nTelecommunication Authority of Singapore. Before I\r\n\r\nelaborate  on the provisions of this Bill,  may  I\r\n\r\ngive  a brief summary o the developments that have\r\n\r\ntaken  place and are taking place in the  Telecoms\r\n\r\nDepartment,  and the rationale for  reconstituting\r\n\r\nthe Department into a statutory authority?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of telecommunication services in\r\n\r\nSingapore  over the last 10 years has  been  at  a\r\n\r\nrapid   rate.   In  the  international   telegraph\r\n\r\nservice,  the number of messages handled increased\r\n\r\nby   65   per   cent  in  1971  over   1966.   The\r\n\r\ninternational  telex service and the international\r\n\r\ntelephone  service increased by 630 per  cent  and\r\n\r\n503 per cent respectively over the same period. In\r\n\r\n1966,  the  Department's revenue  was  only  $19.5\r\n\r\nmillion, but last year (1971) revenue increased to\r\n\r\n$54.7 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of countries with which Singapore has\r\n\r\nestablished traffic service has also increased. In\r\n\r\n1966,   Singapore   had  international   telephone\r\n\r\nservice  with 74 countries, and this increased  to\r\n\r\n147  countries  last  year. In  the  international\r\n\r\ntelex  service, the number of countries  increased\r\n\r\nfrom  64 to 126. The public telegraph service  is,\r\n\r\nhowever, on a world-wide basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the international telegraph service, the\r\n\r\ngrowth  is expected to be maintained at  a  steady\r\n\r\nrate  of  7 to 9 per cent per annum over the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years and around 4 to 6 per cent after 1977.\r\n\r\nThe  growth  in  international  telex  service  is\r\n\r\nexpected to be maintained at the high rate  of  30\r\n\r\nper  cent per annum over the next five years,  and\r\n\r\nthereafter we may expect a growth rate of about 25\r\n\r\nto  30 per cent per annum, as in the case of  most\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries.  The  growth  rate  of   the\r\n\r\ninternational telephone traffic in other parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  world is about 20 per cent per annum, and  we\r\n\r\ncan  expect  our  own growth  to  be  around  this\r\n\r\nfigure, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet these demands, the Department has\r\n\r\nimplemented certain projects, including subscriber\r\n\r\ntrunk   dialling   to  West  Malaysia,   automatic\r\n\r\nnational telex\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexchange,  and  the  establishment  of  an   earth\r\n\r\nsatellite station at Sentosa. In the near  future,\r\n\r\nthe Department will also be providing an automatic\r\n\r\ninternational  telex  exchange  and  an  automatic\r\n\r\nmessage  switching system. A second earth  station\r\n\r\nworking  to the Pacific Ocean satellite is already\r\n\r\nin the final planning stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the high rate of growth and fast changing\r\n\r\ntechnology  in  communications, it is  clear  that\r\n\r\nthere  must be radical changes in the organisation\r\n\r\nand  management to cope with the rapid changes and\r\n\r\nchallenges in the years ahead. An expert from  the\r\n\r\nInternational Telecommunications Union was invited\r\n\r\nto   advise  us  on  the  reorganisation  of   the\r\n\r\ntelecommunication   services    and    his    firm\r\n\r\nrecommendation  was that the Telecorns  Department\r\n\r\nshould  be  converted into an autonomous statutory\r\n\r\norganisation, which was accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now summarise the main features of this\r\n\r\nBill.   The   Telecommunication  Authority   shall\r\n\r\nconsist of a Chairman, a General Manager and  such\r\n\r\nother members totalling not less than five and not\r\n\r\nmore than nine, in accordance with Clause 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority shall have the exclusive privilege\r\n\r\nof   operating   telecommunication   services   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  with the exception of broadcasting  and\r\n\r\ntelevision  services  and the  domestic  telephone\r\n\r\nservice and telecommunication services operated by\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Armed Forces and the  Police.  The\r\n\r\nmain  object  of  the  Authority  is  to  provide,\r\n\r\noperate,  and  develop telecommunication  services\r\n\r\nwithin  and  outside Singapore, and to  co-operate\r\n\r\nwith  other  international  authorities  for   the\r\n\r\nexpansion  and  improvement of such services.  The\r\n\r\nAuthority  has  power to decide on charges,  rates\r\n\r\nand fees for providing telecommunication services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority may, with the approval of the\r\n\r\nMinister,  borrow, raise capital and  also  invest\r\n\r\nits surplus funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided in clause 42 that the Authority\r\n\r\nshall  issue  to Government ordinary  stock  of  a\r\n\r\ntotal nominal value to be agreed upon between  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance and the Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Annual Report and audited Statement of\r\n\r\nAccounts  of  the Authority shall be presented  to\r\n\r\nParliament under clauses 33 and 34.

Whilst  their  observations\r\n\r\nare  noteworthy,  I  would like  to  seek  further\r\n\r\nelucidation  from  the Minister  of  State,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office,  on the scope,  function,  and\r\n\r\nfuture planning of this very important Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister of Defence, who was speaking\r\n\r\nfor  the  Prime Minister during the Budget session\r\n\r\nlast year, disclosed that this Unit, comprising  a\r\n\r\nteam  of  three  scientists of very high  calibre,\r\n\r\nexists in the Public Works Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  quote from Hansard dated 18th March, 1971, Vol.\r\n\r\n30, No. 12, col. 790:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... - all three of them - have gone abroad to study\r\n\r\nair  pollution  problems; one  to  Australia,  the\r\n\r\nsecond to America, and the third to Europe.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  also  mentioned that their functions were  not\r\n\r\nthose of an enforcement nature but purely to study\r\n\r\nthe problems and to establish monitoring stations,\r\n\r\nmake  recommendations  to the  Prime  Minister  on\r\n\r\nmatters  of  policy,  including  legislation,  and\r\n\r\nadvise  on measures that suit our situation  best.\r\n\r\nIn  this  respect, perhaps the Minister  of  State\r\n\r\nwould  care to enlighten this House as to  whether\r\n\r\nany  recommendations from this top calibre,  high-powered team of scientists have been submitted  to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister. As a consequence,  will  any\r\n\r\nmeasures  be  taken by this Unit, on  a  long-term\r\n\r\nbasis,  to ensure that our City state will not  be\r\n\r\nfaced  with the hazards of pollution? Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nindeed   highly  commendable  that  Singapore   is\r\n\r\ntackling this pollution problem seriously and at a\r\n\r\nmuch  earlier  stage  than  many  other  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  like  the  United Kingdom,  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  of America and Japan, which only  recently\r\n\r\nbegan to grapple with this problem, long after  it\r\n\r\nhas become an environmental hazard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another minor observation, if I may hasten to\r\n\r\nadd,  is that, although this Unit has been charged\r\n\r\nwith   a  very  high  responsibility,  its  entire\r\n\r\nstaffing  position, ranging from the Head  of  the\r\n\r\nUnit right down to the office boy comes to a total\r\n\r\nstrength of only 23 persons. In other words,  this\r\n\r\nUnit  appears  rather small  to  be  able  to  co-ordinate  its  activities against  air  pollution,\r\n\r\npollution of water-ways, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, hope that the Minister of State\r\n\r\nwill  be  good enough to throw some light  on  the\r\n\r\nmeasures which are being taken or will be taken to\r\n\r\nensure that Singapore will be pollution free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sir, despite the\r\n\r\nanti-pollution measures that have  been  taken  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, there is still a great deal  of  noise,\r\n\r\nsmoke and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npollution  of  water at present. It  is  a  common\r\n\r\nsight  to  see  antiquated-looking buses  belching\r\n\r\nsmoke  to  envelope passers-by and other  vehicles\r\n\r\ntravelling along their side. It is high  time  the\r\n\r\nAnti-Pollution  Unit  paid  greater  attention  to\r\n\r\nthese  lumbering monsters emitting poisonous fumes\r\n\r\ninto our atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During pasar malam nights and at hawker sites in\r\n\r\nvarious  parts of the island, the generators  that\r\n\r\nsupply  electricity are not only  noisy  but  they\r\n\r\nalso  emit a lot of fumes. Record shops and stalls\r\n\r\noperating at pasar malam sites too seem to  derive\r\n\r\npleasure  in creating noise. They are  allowed  to\r\n\r\nblare  out music from their records at a deafening\r\n\r\npitch.  It  is time legislation was introduced  to\r\n\r\ncompel   record   shops  to  install   and   equip\r\n\r\nsoundproof   rooms  within  their  premises.   The\r\n\r\nHawkers'   Department   should   note   this,   in\r\n\r\nparticular.

The  other matter  of  air  pollution\r\n\r\ncomes  under  the  charge  of  the  Registrar   of\r\n\r\nVehicles,    and    water   pollution    is    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Public Utilities Board.  For\r\n\r\nthe time being, this Unit is solely concerned with\r\n\r\nair  pollution. In this respect, the Unit monitors\r\n\r\nthe   air  for  the  various  air  pollutants   in\r\n\r\ndifferent  parts of Singapore, and upon  detection\r\n\r\ncarries out enforcement measures under the  Clean\r\n\r\nAir   Act.  The  Unit  also  advises  the  various\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies, such as  the  Jurong  Tower\r\n\r\nCorporation,  the  Planning  Department  and   the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board, on various aspects  of\r\n\r\npollution  problems  and  also  acts  as   a   co-ordinating body for all such activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his recent Budget\r\n\r\nspeech  has  indicated that Government will  allow\r\n\r\naccelerated  depreciation  over  three  years   on\r\n\r\ncapital investment in approved anti-pollution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevices.  This, together with the new  tax  relief\r\n\r\nmeasures, will cost the Government a total loss of\r\n\r\nrevenue of approximately $3.5 million. This is  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  the people of  Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nshould  be an incentive to industrialists  to  act\r\n\r\nnow  by  installing anti-pollution devices and  so\r\n\r\ntake advantage of this opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Unit is taking every effort to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  air around us is pollution free, so that our\r\n\r\npeople  can lead a healthy life wherever they  may\r\n\r\nlive.

For the moment, it  may\r\n\r\nconfine  itself to air pollution, but  as  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  just  now,  it should  co-ordinate  its\r\n\r\nactivities  with  other  departments  though   the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State has also pointed out  that  the\r\n\r\nUnit   acts  as  a  co-ordinating  body  for  such\r\n\r\nactivities.

In the next several months the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the Ministry will be intensified further\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) further work of metrication;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) increased responsibility over the\r\n\r\nconstruction,  staffing and  equipping  of\r\n\r\nthe Science Centre in Jurong; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the possibility of the setting up of the Centre for Applied Research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this pressure as well as\r\n\r\npossibilities of expansion, I feel that  making  a\r\n\r\nDeputy Secretary as the Chief Executive Officer of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry,  instead of a  Principal  Assistant\r\n\r\nSecretary,  is  overdue. I hope  that  this  post,\r\n\r\ntogether with the other vacancies, will be  filled\r\n\r\nas  soon as possible, and that a three-month delay\r\n\r\nimplied by the Vote is all the delay that will  be\r\n\r\ntolerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wonder whether the Minstrel would, in\r\n\r\nrespect   of  the  proposed  Centre  for   Applied\r\n\r\nResearch, care to expatiate on the brief reference\r\n\r\nmade on this Centre by the Minister for Finance in\r\n\r\nhis Budget address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I indicated last year\r\n\r\nthat I would appeal to the Ministry of Finance for\r\n\r\na  Deputy Secretary as and when the volume of work\r\n\r\nin my Ministry grows.

Members  would\r\n\r\nperhaps  like to know that it is not very easy  to\r\n\r\nget  people  who  are versed in administration  as\r\n\r\nwell  as in science and technology to occupy  this\r\n\r\npost,  because  at the moment people  who  are  so\r\n\r\nqualified  prefer to obtain a similar job  outside\r\n\r\nthe  public sector where it is more convenient and\r\n\r\nbetter paid. Because of this competition which the\r\n\r\nGovernment is faced with, there may be some  delay\r\n\r\nbefore we can find a suitable person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no objection to replying to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Katong on the Centre for Applied Research.  As\r\n\r\nSingapore's industrialisation and economic  growth\r\n\r\ncontinue  to progress, it has become obvious  that\r\n\r\nmultifarious problems are popping up  to  confront\r\n\r\nthe  Government, statutory bodies, and the private\r\n\r\nsector.  It is true that civil servants,  both  in\r\n\r\nthe Government and statutory bodies, are very much\r\n\r\npre-occupied    with    routine     matters     of\r\n\r\nadministration and day-to-day operations of  their\r\n\r\ndepartments  to  apply their  minds  to  work  out\r\n\r\nsolutions to problems confronting them, or even to\r\n\r\nsit  down and identify the problems which they may\r\n\r\nhave  to  deal  with in executing  any  particular\r\n\r\npolicy.  This  is particularly so  of  the  public\r\n\r\nsector,  and  generally so of the private  sector,\r\n\r\nwhere  the multi-national companies have  invested\r\n\r\nheavily in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, my Ministry commissioned the\r\n\r\nStanford  Research Institute last  year  to  do  a\r\n\r\nstudy  on  the setting up of a Centre for  Applied\r\n\r\nResearch in Singapore. Their report suggests  that\r\n\r\nsuch  a  Centre should be established as a private\r\n\r\ncompany  limited by guarantee, and  will  have  no\r\n\r\nshareholders, in order to maintain confidentiality\r\n\r\nof  research reports and in order that the company\r\n\r\ncan call itself a non-profit making institution so\r\n\r\nthat  it  will not have to pay income tax  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. It will also have no dividends to  pay\r\n\r\nout.  But  the ultimate objective of  the  company\r\n\r\nwill  be  to  sustain the costs  of  the  research\r\n\r\nefforts  that it puts in. The Ministry of  Finance\r\n\r\nhas promised a sum of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney to initiate operations for the setting up of\r\n\r\nthe Centre for Applied Research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas of research which the Centre will\r\n\r\ninitially  embark upon will be in market research,\r\n\r\nparticularly for export products, distribution and\r\n\r\ntransportation   analyses   (both   national   and\r\n\r\ninternational), management information and control\r\n\r\nsystems and procedures, corporate strategy,  long-range  planning assistance, economic  analysis  of\r\n\r\ngrowth potential in relation to changing economic,\r\n\r\npolitical and technical environment in this region\r\n\r\nand  throughout the world, industrial  feasibility\r\n\r\nsurvey,  including  cost-profit  projections   for\r\n\r\nspecific   products,  processes,  and   industrial\r\n\r\nundertakings,  industrial  engineering,  technical\r\n\r\nproblems  peculiar  to  our tropical  environment,\r\n\r\nsuch  as corrosion control or insulation problems,\r\n\r\nproduct  innovation and adaptation to  meet  local\r\n\r\nand  other  market  requirements,  and  increasing\r\n\r\ntotal  value  added in manufacture.  Subsequently,\r\n\r\nwhen  the Centre has begun its initial operations,\r\n\r\nit  will embark upon more technical studies  which\r\n\r\nare  confronted  in  the engineering  and  applied\r\n\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem which we are now confronted with is\r\n\r\nmanpower.  It is not the purpose of the Centre  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  very highly qualified and very  expensive\r\n\r\npersonnel  to form a nucleus for this Centre.  But\r\n\r\nit will try to utilize whatever expertise there is\r\n\r\navailable  in  Singapore,  particularly   in   our\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  higher  learning.  Some  of  the\r\n\r\ncontract work can be farmed out to such experts or\r\n\r\nthey  can  be brought in as consultants.  The  key\r\n\r\nperson, who will be the manager of the Centre,  is\r\n\r\nnow  being sought, and when appointed, the company\r\n\r\nwill   be   launched   as  a   non-profit   making\r\n\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, my Ministry is engaged in drawing\r\n\r\nup  the Articles of Association and Memorandum for\r\n\r\nthe company.

There is the Weights  and\r\n\r\nMeasures  Division  in  the Department  of  Trade,\r\n\r\nwhich  regularly  inspects the  measures  used  by\r\n\r\nhawkers. In the distant future, when hawkers begin\r\n\r\nto  metricate, he can be assured that the Division\r\n\r\nwill be very active in inspecting the balances, or\r\n\r\nwhatever measures the hawkers will use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the Chambers of Commerce had\r\n\r\ntaken the initiative to ask textile shopkeepers to\r\n\r\nsell  currently  by the metre instead  of  by  the\r\n\r\nyard.  This began in March. But not all shops  are\r\n\r\nfollowing  this new practice, but we  expect  that\r\n\r\nover  a period of time even the smaller shops will\r\n\r\ngradually follow suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent shopkeepers from\r\n\r\nprofiteering  on  this  change,  members  of   the\r\n\r\nMetrication  Board and the Consumers'  Association\r\n\r\nof  Singapore have been visiting textile shops  to\r\n\r\nwatch the progress of metrication.

In fact,\r\n\r\nthere are some textile firms selling by the metre,\r\n\r\nbut are charging rates at the old measure, i.e, by\r\n\r\nthe yard. In other words, they are prepared to\r\n\r\nround off the old measures into metric, so that\r\n\r\nthe consumer, in fact, stands to gain rather than\r\n\r\nlose. In view of this, the Metrication Board\r\n\r\nintends to publicise those shops which are\r\n\r\ncharging at the old rates but measuring out with\r\n\r\nthe metre rule instead of the yard rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Does\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Science and Technology know that\r\n\r\nbefore hawkers begin to metricate, we have to make\r\n\r\nsure   that  they  do  not  use  this  system   of\r\n\r\nmeasurement  to cheat. For example, textile  shops\r\n\r\nhave  started  to metricate, and  some  have  been\r\n\r\ncharging  their customers wrongly.  Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nmust very carefully see that when we go metric the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers  and  hawkers do not  cheat  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople,   who  form  the  majority  of  consumers.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  feel  that the Minister  must  take\r\n\r\nsevere  action against unscrupulous  retailers  in\r\n\r\nthe future when Singapore has fully gone metric.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in view of the detailed explanation, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $596,980 for Head 0301 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0401 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1004.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Defence has been allocated\r\n\r\na  provision  of  about $442 million.  This  takes\r\n\r\nfirst  place in the national expenditure. This  is\r\n\r\n38.9  per cent of our total expenditure; 16.5  per\r\n\r\ncent  more  than  the estimate for  last  year.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  this  increased  expenditure  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to meet the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffects  of the final rundown of British  military\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and that our Government  now  has  to\r\n\r\nshoulder   the  entire  responsibility   for   our\r\n\r\ninternal  security. In view of this,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nincrease our expenditure to build up our own armed\r\n\r\nforces.  At  the  same time, we  have  to  examine\r\n\r\nwhether  expected  and desirable  results  can  be\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I touch on the problem of National\r\n\r\nService.  The  National Service Act  has  been  in\r\n\r\nforce for the last few years. With the support  of\r\n\r\nthe  people and the efficient enforcement  of  the\r\n\r\nlaw,  it  has achieved certain desirable  results.\r\n\r\nOur  citizens  now realise that as an  independent\r\n\r\nnation,  we  must have our own defence  forces  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  our  national and  territorial  rights.\r\n\r\nThey have also realised that national service  has\r\n\r\nbrought  about many benefits to our  country.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  our youths can be mobilised for training\r\n\r\nto  become  the  stalwarts of our defence  forces.\r\n\r\nNational  service also enhances  the  quality  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline  of  our youths, and  thus  promotes  a\r\n\r\nbetter organisation of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have achieved much from national\r\n\r\nservice, there are certain shortcomings. They are,\r\n\r\nhowever, technical in nature. In other words, they\r\n\r\nrelate to the training courses. If the officers in\r\n\r\ncharge  of training can remedy these faults,  then\r\n\r\nthe  position  will  be all  right.  The  training\r\n\r\ncourses  do  not  inculcate a  sense  of  national\r\n\r\nidentity   and   consciousness  in  our   national\r\n\r\nservicemen.  This is a very important  factor.  We\r\n\r\nare  a very young nation. Therefore, in the course\r\n\r\nof  our nation building, we have to instil a sense\r\n\r\nof  national  identity in our young  people.  They\r\n\r\nshould  be  inculcated with a  sense  of  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness and patriotism so that our  national\r\n\r\nservicemen will love our country. Only then,  will\r\n\r\nthey  identify themselves with the country and  be\r\n\r\ngiven an opportunity to serve. In order to achieve\r\n\r\nthat  objective,  the Ministry of  Defence  should\r\n\r\nstrengthen its educational and cultural  division.\r\n\r\nMore cultural and educational officers should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  employed  to  promote  national  consciousness\r\n\r\namong our national servicemen youths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints from our\r\n\r\nnational   servicemen.  Having  reached   national\r\n\r\nservice  age, they registered themselves with  the\r\n\r\nManpower    Division,   and   underwent    medical\r\n\r\nexamination. But some of these youths have not  as\r\n\r\nyet  been enlisted in the army. What is the reason\r\n\r\nfor  the  delay?  They are very willing  to  serve\r\n\r\ntheir  country, and we should help them to realise\r\n\r\ntheir aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem. These youths have to\r\n\r\nundergo  national  service training.  However,  in\r\n\r\nlooking    for   jobs   they   encounter   certain\r\n\r\ndifficulties  because the Government  has  decided\r\n\r\nthat   unless  they  receive  a  certificate   for\r\n\r\nemployment from the Manpower Division, they cannot\r\n\r\nlook  for  a job in either the private  or  public\r\n\r\nsector.  Therefore, I urge the  Minister  to  take\r\n\r\nnote  of  this  situation and to take  appropriate\r\n\r\nmeasures to remedy such shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I agree very much  with  what  the\r\n\r\nMember  has  said, particularly the need  to  have\r\n\r\nsoldiers who are loyal, patriotic and conscious of\r\n\r\ntheir national identity. However, this business of\r\n\r\ninculcating   national   consciousness   is    not\r\n\r\nsomething  that can be done only in the  Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed   Forces  during  the  period  of   national\r\n\r\nservice. If a boy of 18 goes into the army without\r\n\r\nknowing  what country he belongs to,  and  has  no\r\n\r\nloyalty   to  Singapore,  then  I  say  that   our\r\n\r\neducational system has failed badly and  that  his\r\n\r\nparents  do  not  know  how  to  look  after  him.\r\n\r\nHowever,  within the army we do try  to  give  our\r\n\r\nyouths further education on this line. But this is\r\n\r\nsomething you cannot overdo, because after all  in\r\n\r\nthe  army  they are to be trained as soldiers  and\r\n\r\nnot  as  patriots, and certainly not in  political\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards educational and cultural services in\r\n\r\nthe  Armed  Forces, the Member has  got  a  point\r\n\r\nthere. In fact, I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlooking for a person with sufficient knowledge and\r\n\r\nexperience to direct or promote cultural shows.  I\r\n\r\nhave  asked Radio and T.V. Singapore whether  they\r\n\r\ncan  send  such a person to my Ministry, but  they\r\n\r\nhave  said  that they need all the producers  they\r\n\r\ncan  lay  their hands on. They have  lost  a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  producers to the  private  sector.  If\r\n\r\nanybody, either within or outside the House, knows\r\n\r\nof a good producer, please recommend him to me. We\r\n\r\ndo  want to run cultural and educational shows  in\r\n\r\nthe  battalion camps at night, because this  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  way of putting across the proper message  by\r\n\r\nsubtle means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the waiting period after medical\r\n\r\nexamination.  A  boy  is  put  through  a  medical\r\n\r\nexamination when he is l7-X years old.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nhe  will  not be called into the army for  another\r\n\r\nsix  to  18  months.  This period  of  waiting  is\r\n\r\nunavoidable.  However, once  he  passes  his  19th\r\n\r\nbirthday and has not yet been called up for  full-time national service, he is not liable for a full-\r\n\r\ntime national service. In such circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nManpower Base will give him a certificate  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  not  liable for  full-time  national\r\n\r\nservice.  Therefore, there is no difficulty  about\r\n\r\nhis getting a job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for his detailed explanation.

Since  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  of  last  year we have stopped  using  the\r\n\r\nC.P.F, computer,  and  are  now  using  computers\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the Electronic Data Processing  Unit\r\n\r\nin   the  Ministry  of  Finance.  They  have   two\r\n\r\ncomputers  and they can spare some of  their  time\r\n\r\nfor us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the sort of work that is being\r\n\r\ncomputerised,  the  following subjects  are  being\r\n\r\ncomputerised. First, the payrolls of officers  but\r\n\r\nnot  those of other ranks. I am not quite sure  of\r\n\r\nthe  reason why. Officers are paid by cheques  and\r\n\r\nthe  other ranks are paid by cash; we have not got\r\n\r\ndown  to  computerising the latter, and I  am  not\r\n\r\nquite sure of the reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we need various data regarding manpower. We\r\n\r\nwant   to  know,  for  instance,  who  should   be\r\n\r\nregistered   in  any  one  year.   We   get   that\r\n\r\ninformation from the identity cards, and therefore\r\n\r\nnobody  can escape because his name is in when  he\r\n\r\napplies for an identity card at the age of 12.  So\r\n\r\nwe know that 4X years later he should register for\r\n\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we computerise other data on manpower, for\r\n\r\ninstance, how many soldiers are in each  unit  and\r\n\r\nagainst   which  establishment.  This   is   being\r\n\r\nreviewed  monthly and quarterly at various  levels\r\n\r\nof detail and completeness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, the Member is aware that the\r\n\r\ncomputer is an ideal system for keeping checks  on\r\n\r\ninventories.   Our   Logistics   Division    makes\r\n\r\nconsiderable  use of the computer in  working  out\r\n\r\ncatalogues, that is, giving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall   the   components  and   code   numbers, in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  stock  level  of  the  hundreds   and\r\n\r\nthousands of items which they have in their bases.\r\n\r\nThis work is done by the computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the personnel employed in this work,\r\n\r\nthey   were  previously  listed  in  the  military\r\n\r\nestablishment.   There  were  actually   some   83\r\n\r\nmilitary posts concerned with producing the  data.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  a  good number of  these  military\r\n\r\npersonnel  were national servicemen  who,  by  the\r\n\r\ntime  they  knew something about their work,  were\r\n\r\ndue  to  leave the army. The work was,  therefore,\r\n\r\nnot done very satisfactorily. We have decided that\r\n\r\nwe  had  better  engage  full-time  and  permanent\r\n\r\ncivilian staff to take over the work, so that they\r\n\r\ncan  accumulate the experience and  expertise  and\r\n\r\nget better year by year. In fact, this is what  we\r\n\r\nhave  done  and we will replace these 83  military\r\n\r\nposts  with  34  civilian  posts,  including  four\r\n\r\noffice boys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the cost of the system, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  we are not buying computers of our own.  We\r\n\r\nare  using Government computers. The pay of  staff\r\n\r\ncomes  to  $232,980  - it is  in  the  budget-  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with more than $671,000 previously.  The\r\n\r\nmaintenance of computers is estimated at  $132,000\r\n\r\nas against $296,710 previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this gives the Member all the information\r\n\r\nhe has asked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,. I have raised\r\n\r\nthis  matter with a view to ascertaining from  the\r\n\r\nparticular  Ministry concerned whether from  their\r\n\r\nown  experience they feel that computerisation  in\r\n\r\nthe  long  run  is  going  to  result  in  greater\r\n\r\nefficiency, and perhaps will enable us to cut down\r\n\r\non  the  number of staff in the civil service,  in\r\n\r\nview   of  the  acute  shortage  of  manpower   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today.  Therefore,  I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  inform  the House  whether,  in  his\r\n\r\nopinion  and  from his own personal experience  in\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Defence,  the  computerisation\r\n\r\nintroduced   so  far  has  resulted   in   greater\r\n\r\nefficiency and with a smaller number of  employees\r\n\r\ndoing the same job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would think\r\n\r\nthat that is so, if it is a question of collecting\r\n\r\ndata.

He said that in order to attract  men\r\n\r\nof high calibre into the officer-cadre ship of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed  Forces,  a  status  has  to   be\r\n\r\naccorded   to  this  officer  corps  by   way   of\r\n\r\nperquisites  like  housing,  provision  of   motor\r\n\r\nvehicles,  and so on. I think there  should  be  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  acceptance of this principle.  In  modern\r\n\r\nwarfare,  it is not the man of brawn, the brawler,\r\n\r\nthe  tough, one of the Dirty Dozen, so  to  speak,\r\n\r\nwho really contributes to victory - except perhaps\r\n\r\nin  television  performances -  although  soldiers\r\n\r\nshould certainly be tough fighters. Marshal Georgi\r\n\r\nZhukov,   perhaps  the  Soviet  Union's   greatest\r\n\r\nsoldier  in  the  last  war,  was  said  to   have\r\n\r\nexpressed the view that war is a science, a series\r\n\r\nof  mathematical  problems to  be  solved  through\r\n\r\nproper  integration and co-ordination of  men  and\r\n\r\nweapons  in  time  and  space.  The  soldier,  and\r\n\r\nespecially the officer, is not the kind  of  metal\r\n\r\nout  of  which rough nails are made. He has indeed\r\n\r\nto have a fine intellectual temper. This being the\r\n\r\ncase, the Singapore Armed Forces has to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseen  as occupying an appropriate position in  our\r\n\r\nsociety. However, it should be easily agreed  also\r\n\r\nthat  status is won as much as it is accorded,  is\r\n\r\nworked for as much as it is given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the S.A.F., especially its\r\n\r\nofficer corps, has a big role to play. In fact, it\r\n\r\nhas already begun this role for some time past and\r\n\r\nshould  continue  to play it more vigorously.  The\r\n\r\nS.A.F, has   participated  in   many   community\r\n\r\nprojects. In my own constituency, we have received\r\n\r\nhelp   in  cleaning-up  operations  after  serious\r\n\r\nflooding. We have received help in the planting of\r\n\r\ntrees.   We   have   received  promise   of   such\r\n\r\ncooperation any time we call upon the help of  the\r\n\r\nmilitary  in  the  vicinity  of  my  constituency.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  there  was a warm  response  to  the\r\n\r\nmilitary  static  display which was  held  at  the\r\n\r\nKatong Community Centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behaviour and the initiative shown by\r\n\r\nofficers  have  been generally exemplary  on  such\r\n\r\noccasions.  It  would be good  to  reiterate  that\r\n\r\nunder  all  circumstances the behaviour of  S.A.F.\r\n\r\nofficers  should  be considerate and  gentlemanly.\r\n\r\nWhen he appears in public places of entertainment,\r\n\r\nfor example, an officer should not forget that  he\r\n\r\nrepresents the Armed Forces, even though he is not\r\n\r\nin  uniform. When driving on the roads, he  should\r\n\r\nalways   show   courtesy,  even  if  courtesy   is\r\n\r\ndistinctly  lacking  in others.  The  point  I  am\r\n\r\ntrying  to  make is that not only should  an  Army\r\n\r\nofficer  set  high  standards  of  behaviour   for\r\n\r\nhimself,  so as to show a leading example  to  his\r\n\r\nmen but, wherever possible, also show such example\r\n\r\nto  those  who may not be in the Armed Forces.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  if there is something wanting  in  the\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of non-S.A.F, members, this should  not\r\n\r\nbe  found  wanting  too in the  standards  of  the\r\n\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect may then be won, and an appropriate\r\n\r\nstatus  found  for  the  S.A.F, in  our  society.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   when  the  soldier,  especially   the\r\n\r\nofficer,   undergoes  training,  he   should,   in\r\n\r\naddition to normal military training, perhaps at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  stage  of  his army career,  be  exposed  to\r\n\r\nknowledge  and experience that would have  a  fine\r\n\r\nand civilizing influence over him, not to make him\r\n\r\nless  of a soldier, but more of a gentleman. If  I\r\n\r\nmay quote from Shakespeare:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In peace there's nothing so becomes a man\r\n\r\nAs modest stillness and humility:\r\n\r\nBut when the blast of war blows in our ears,\r\n\r\nThen imitate the action of the tiger;'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Henry V. Act 111, Scene 1, lines 3-6..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the speech that the\r\n\r\nMember for Katong was ref erring to was made by me\r\n\r\nat   the   Istana   commissioning  ceremony   last\r\n\r\nNovember. Perhaps I might say a few words  on  the\r\n\r\nprogress  that has been achieved to give  officers\r\n\r\nbetter perks, such as a decent car, house, and  so\r\n\r\non.   The  Manpower  Division,  M.I.D.,  has  been\r\n\r\napplying  their  minds to this  subject  of  staff\r\n\r\ncars,  and  the thinking now is that  officers  in\r\n\r\ncommand of brigades or higher formations should be\r\n\r\ngetting   a  Mercedes,  and  battalion  commanders\r\n\r\nshould  get  a Ford Cortina, or a slightly  bigger\r\n\r\ncar,  but  I  am told that none of that  is  being\r\n\r\nassembled here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards houses for them to live in and to buy\r\n\r\non  instalments, my Permanent Secretary  has  been\r\n\r\nhunting for a suitable tract of land. After  three\r\n\r\nor  four  trials, I think he has found  the  right\r\n\r\ntract.  There is quite a good piece  of  land  off\r\n\r\nAyer  Rajah Road, where the British Navy  used  to\r\n\r\nhave  some  oil tanks which we now  think  we  can\r\n\r\nafford  to  demolish. It is in a very  nice  area,\r\n\r\nvery central, and we are now negotiating with  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board to see whether or not we  can  take\r\n\r\npart  of  the  land  to build high-rise  apartment\r\n\r\nblocks  for  sale  to our officers  on  instalment\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the other matter of the way an officer\r\n\r\nand  a  gentleman  should conduct  himself,  I  am\r\n\r\nimpressed by what the Member has said. If he  will\r\n\r\nlet  me have a copy of his speech, or perhaps with\r\n\r\nyour  permission,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  if  we  could\r\n\r\nextract  it from the Hansard, we might publish  it\r\n\r\nin the next issue of the Pioneer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am flattered by the\r\n\r\nMinister's request, and I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $442,831,720 for Head 0401 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0501 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 4X50l be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs J. F.  Conceicao, Low Yong Nguan and P.

This is  only  a  slight\r\n\r\nincrease over the provision for the last financial\r\n\r\nyear. It shows that the Ministry has increased its\r\n\r\nactivities,   and  we  have  got  quite   a   good\r\n\r\nreputation in the field of international diplomacy\r\n\r\nand  foreign affairs. We have been able to acquire\r\n\r\nmore  international friends. Of course,  the  main\r\n\r\naim of our foreign policy is based on our national\r\n\r\ninterest. Under this grand ideal and principle, we\r\n\r\nwill  try  to resort to all practical measures  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  good relationship with as many countries\r\n\r\nas  possible and to establish trade relations with\r\n\r\nthem.  Of  course,  this  is  Beneficial  to   our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that Members will agree with me\r\n\r\nwhen  I  say  that  we can be  successful  in  our\r\n\r\nforeign  policy because we have not  only  a  good\r\n\r\nforeign  policy  but also a capable  Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign   Affairs,  which  is  also  an  important\r\n\r\nfactor. However, I have four questions to  ask  of\r\n\r\nthe Minister:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Up to-date, in how many countries have we set\r\n\r\nup embassies or high commissions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is there any plan to set up any new `consular\r\n\r\ncorps in any country this year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) In the past one year, what benefits have we\r\n\r\nderived from the ASEAN organisation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) How many creditable measures in this year's\r\n\r\nASEAN  Regional Programme can help us  to  promote\r\n\r\nour tourism and trade, and in other fields?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister will be good enough\r\n\r\nto answer all these questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last\r\n\r\nfortnight or so, a phenomenon has been reported  a\r\n\r\nnumber of times in several newspapers about the so-called \"squall\" over the Straits of Malacca. There\r\n\r\nwere   arguments  as  to  whether  it  should   be\r\n\r\ninternationalised, or whether certain  limitations\r\n\r\nshould  be  imposed  on  navigation  through   the\r\n\r\nstraits, and a decision over this matter may  have\r\n\r\nsome  important  consequences  for  us.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  it is opportune and appropriate  at  this\r\n\r\ntime  for the Minister to comment further on  this\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime\r\n\r\nago,  the Chinese Chamber of Commerce successfully\r\n\r\norganised  a trade mission to Communist  China.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  more such visits should be encouraged.\r\n\r\nMay I ask if our Government intends to improve the\r\n\r\nrelationship  by sending more trade missions,  and\r\n\r\nfinally  establishing  full diplomatic  ties  with\r\n\r\nChina?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I must\r\n\r\nsay  that  I  am  always very glad  to  listen  to\r\n\r\nspeeches  from  the Member for Sembawang,  because\r\n\r\nhis  estimation  of my capability is  higher  than\r\n\r\nthat of my own. This is rather reassuring!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to his question as to how many\r\n\r\nembassies  we now have in the different countries,\r\n\r\nthere  are at present seven Ambassadors  and  five\r\n\r\nHigh Commissioners in Commonwealth countries,  one\r\n\r\nPermanent  Representative in the  United  Nations,\r\n\r\nand one High Commissioner in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards whether we have any plans to set up\r\n\r\nnew  embassies  or missions, we  have  set  up  an\r\n\r\nembassy  in Brussels, and there is a consulate  in\r\n\r\nMedan. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfar  as  I know, we have no other plans to set  up\r\n\r\nany  more  missions, unless there is the need  for\r\n\r\nit. As the Member probably knows, we do not set up\r\n\r\nmissions or embassies for the sake of prestige but\r\n\r\nonly where there is a clear need, either political\r\n\r\nor  economical,  or  otherwise,  to  set  up  such\r\n\r\nmission. As I have said in the past, sometimes you\r\n\r\nare  able  to  promote the best of relations  with\r\n\r\nother countries without having to set up embassies\r\n\r\nor missions in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question which the Member asked was\r\n\r\nwhat  benefits have we derived from being a member\r\n\r\nof  ASEAN. ASEAN has been undertaking a number  of\r\n\r\nprojects  during  the  past year  for  the  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit of member-countries, but these are  mainly\r\n\r\nin  the  field of tourism. In fact,  a  number  of\r\n\r\nactivities  were conducted as part of  the  \"Visit\r\n\r\nASEAN  Year  of  1971\".  We have  conducted  trade\r\n\r\nseminars  in Auckland, Sydney and Perth,  for  the\r\n\r\ntourist industry there. There was the Visit  ASEAN\r\n\r\nYear commemorative stamps. Then also there was the\r\n\r\nASEAN   Film   Festival  held   last   year.   The\r\n\r\ncompetition  was  organised  to  select  an  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmusical  team to introduce joint-ASEAN  Radio  and\r\n\r\nT.V.  Programme as part of our cultural activities\r\n\r\nwith  ASEAN.  A  number of countries  participated\r\n\r\njointly  in the ASEAN Pavilion at the 1971 Jakarta\r\n\r\nFair,  which is part of a joint effort to  promote\r\n\r\ntrade and commerce among member-countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to civil aviation, four project-teams\r\n\r\nof  aviation experts visited the ASEAN capitals to\r\n\r\nsurvey    operational   and   airport   facilities\r\n\r\navailable  in  each country, with a  view  to  co-ordinating such services among member-countries so\r\n\r\nthat each country can provide a better service for\r\n\r\nair  traffic operations within the region. We have\r\n\r\ntraining  courses, workshops and seminars relating\r\n\r\nto  a  variety  of subjects, such as  seminars  on\r\n\r\nproduction and fisheries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these benefits, there are 11\r\n\r\nPermanent  Committees, all of  which  continue  to\r\n\r\nexchange  information relevant  to  their  fields.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  year  a  number of them  consolidated\r\n\r\ntheir activities by establishing clearing houses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  collection,  processing and dissemination  of\r\n\r\ninformation and publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also requested a United Nations Study\r\n\r\nTeam  to make a study and to report on the  fields\r\n\r\nof trade and industrial co-operation, monetary and\r\n\r\nfinancial   co-operation,  forestry   and   forest\r\n\r\nindustry,  agriculture  and  shipping.  The  final\r\n\r\nreport of this U.N. Study Team is expected  to  be\r\n\r\nready sometime at the end of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from all this, there have been the\r\n\r\ngranting  of  scholarships under the ASEAN  scheme\r\n\r\nand, as far as Singapore is concerned, there are a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  ASEAN scholars studying in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  there are 15 in the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, eight in Nan-yang University and 74 Pre-University  students.  These  are  some   of   the\r\n\r\nactivities,  not  very  dramatic,  but   obviously\r\n\r\nprogress  is being made and this is a  bit  better\r\n\r\nthan making no progress at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nabout   establishing  diplomatic  ties  with   the\r\n\r\nPeople's Republic of China, I have stated on  many\r\n\r\noccasions  that,  in  principle,  since  we   have\r\n\r\nrecognised and supported China's admission to  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  we must, sooner  or  later,  have\r\n\r\nother  forms of relation with them. But we are  an\r\n\r\nisland-state situated in South-east Asia. We  have\r\n\r\nmany neighbours whose interests and views must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered   should   we  want   to   enter   into\r\n\r\nnegotiations to establish a diplomatic mission  in\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Republic  of  China.  And  as  some\r\n\r\nMembers  here may be aware, the members  of  ASEAN\r\n\r\nhave  discussed this matter and there  is  general\r\n\r\nagreement  that before any member of ASEAN  enters\r\n\r\ninto   diplomatic  relations  with  the   People's\r\n\r\nRepublic of China, he must consult the body and co-ordinate his action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits of Malacca and of Singapore is a\r\n\r\ntopical  issue  at  the  moment,  but  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily the be-all and end-all of  the  issue.\r\n\r\nIt  is imperative that the Straits of Malacca  and\r\n\r\nof Singapore should not become the catalyst for  a\r\n\r\nnew cold war. It could well become one,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  the discussion and approach to this issue  and\r\n\r\nthe  problems connected with it were discussed  in\r\n\r\nterms  inviting  cold  war postures  by  countries\r\n\r\nwithin  or outside the region. Once such  postures\r\n\r\nand  attitudes  are taken then it becomes,  as  it\r\n\r\nalways  does, an intractable cold war issue.  Then\r\n\r\nrational  solutions which are now open  to  us  to\r\n\r\nresolve  some of the real problems connected  with\r\n\r\nthe Straits may be closed, if not forever, then at\r\n\r\nleast  for  a  long time. The real problems  could\r\n\r\nwell  be lost sight of, once the question  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits of Malacca and of Singapore is befogged by\r\n\r\ncold war considerations. I do not need to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the Member, if he had been  reading\r\n\r\nthe papers recently, that we are coming close to a\r\n\r\ncold  war over the Straits of Malacca, and by that\r\n\r\nI  mean that there are incipient murmurs of such a\r\n\r\npossibility.  This  will be tragic,  since,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the detente between China and the United\r\n\r\nStates, the prospects of running down the old cold\r\n\r\nwar  in  Indochina  and  in  South-east  Asia  are\r\n\r\ngenerally  better  than they  bad  been  for  many\r\n\r\nyears. Therefore, it will be tragic if we start  a\r\n\r\nnew  cold war in our region. As Singapore sees it,\r\n\r\nthe Straits of Malacca and of Singapore is a vital\r\n\r\nlane  for  sea  communications and  trade  between\r\n\r\nEurope,  Africa and Western Asia on the one  hand,\r\n\r\nand the Far East on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that this lane should be freely\r\n\r\naccessible  to all nations without discrimination.\r\n\r\nIt  has been used as an international waterway for\r\n\r\ncenturies  and  has become a major artery  of  the\r\n\r\nnetwork of international communications and trade.\r\n\r\nTo  do anything or to say anything to disrupt this\r\n\r\nis  to  disrupt  international communications  and\r\n\r\ntrade  seriously.  But  Singapore,  together  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Malaysia, are concerned with some of\r\n\r\nthe  problems  affecting  our  national  interests\r\n\r\nwhich have arisen as a result of increased traffic\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Straits. There  is  need  to  ensure\r\n\r\nsafety   of   navigation,  to  avoid   danger   of\r\n\r\ncollisions  as  a  result of  larger  vessels  and\r\n\r\nincreased traffic. There is also the danger of oil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  other  forms  of pollution,  which  can  have\r\n\r\ndisastrous  consequences for the  three  countries\r\n\r\nbordering the Straits. There are also problems  of\r\n\r\nsecurity arising from naval rivalry of big powers.\r\n\r\nIn   other  words,  while  Singapore  stands   for\r\n\r\nunimpeded  passage  of all ships  of  all  nations\r\n\r\nthrough the Straits, it also feels that those  who\r\n\r\nuse  it  must,  in turn, agree to observe  certain\r\n\r\nrules  and regulations to ensure safety, security,\r\n\r\nand avoid risks of collision in the Straits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this end in view, the three countries held\r\n\r\ndiscussions  in November last year and  agreed  to\r\n\r\nestablish a body composed of their representatives\r\n\r\nto   coordinate   efforts  for   the   safety   of\r\n\r\nnavigation.  The three countries agreed  that  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of safety of navigation and the question\r\n\r\nof   the  so-called  internationalisation  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits are two separate issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia and Malaysia were of the view that the\r\n\r\nStraits  of  Malacca  and  of  Singapore  are  not\r\n\r\ninternational straits, while recognising  the  use\r\n\r\nof  the  Straits  for  international  shipping  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the principle of innocent passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, however, could not go any further\r\n\r\nthan  to  take  note  of  the  views  of  our  two\r\n\r\nneighbours.  The  reason is that,  in  Singapore's\r\n\r\nview, the status of the Straits of Malacca and  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should not be considered  in  isolation\r\n\r\nbut  in  conjunction with the status of  some  114\r\n\r\nstraits  scattered throughout the world and  which\r\n\r\nare  considered  vital links in international  sea\r\n\r\ncommunications. These straits are spread over  all\r\n\r\ncontinents  and  adjoin many  countries,  such  as\r\n\r\nCanada,  Denmark, United Kingdom,  United  States,\r\n\r\nthe   U.S.S.R.,   Japan,  China,  Australia,   New\r\n\r\nZealand, and many others. We feel that it would be\r\n\r\npremature  to settle the status of the Straits  of\r\n\r\nMalacca  one  way  or the other  without  reaching\r\n\r\nagreement on the other 113 such straits which  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  by  the  U.N, to be  of  international\r\n\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be uniformity of agreement in regard\r\n\r\nto  the  status  of  all straits of  international\r\n\r\nimportance.  The  alternative to an  international\r\n\r\nagreement is a dangerous scramble for the carve up\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot only straits, but of oceans as well. Hitherto,\r\n\r\nmost  conflicts known to mankind have  had  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  the  carve  up of land and rectification  of\r\n\r\nland  frontiers. Now that most of the world's land\r\n\r\nmass  have been carved up, there could well  be  a\r\n\r\nscramble  for the carve up of straits and  oceans.\r\n\r\nAnd once the principle is conceded that the oceans\r\n\r\nare open for picking by those with power and might\r\n\r\nand  strength,  and to declare portions  of  these\r\n\r\noceans as their preserves, then small countries  -\r\n\r\nwhoever  else  may  win-  will  certainly  be  the\r\n\r\nlosers. That is why Singapore is strongly  of  the\r\n\r\nview  that  the  status of all straits,  including\r\n\r\nthat  of  Malacca and Singapore, should be settled\r\n\r\nby  mutual accord and agreement in a rational  way\r\n\r\nat  the  United Nations Law of the Sea  Conference\r\n\r\ntentatively  scheduled for  next  year.  Were  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of the oceans and straits of international\r\n\r\nimportance   to  be  settled  on  the   basis   of\r\n\r\nunilateral carve ups on the principle of  \"finders\r\n\r\nkeepers\",  then the seas of the world - they  make\r\n\r\nup  most of the world - could well become areas of\r\n\r\nanarchy  and contest where right must be and  will\r\n\r\nbe largely on the side of those who have the might\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  technological terms, means  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  the  biggest  navy,  the  largest  submarine\r\n\r\nfleets,  and the greatest air power. So  for  this\r\n\r\nreason, we believe that the Straits of Malacca and\r\n\r\nof Singapore should not be made a cold war problem\r\n\r\nor a power conflict problem, but largely a problem\r\n\r\nof communications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister\r\n\r\nvery  much for his detailed reply to me.

I  know that there is  another  item\r\n\r\nshowing the payment of overseas allowances to  our\r\n\r\nrepresentatives abroad, but despite this allowance\r\n\r\nI  have  the impression that total emoluments  for\r\n\r\nour  Heads  of Missions are still not enough.  One\r\n\r\npoint  that  springs  to  mind  is  what  is   the\r\n\r\ncriterion used to determine the grade of allowance\r\n\r\nthat  a  particular Head of a Mission is  entitled\r\n\r\nto?  Here  again, perhaps there is no relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the cost of living for an Ambassador  and\r\n\r\nthe  allowances that he actually gets. Sir, we are\r\n\r\nsupposed to be a Republic with the second  highest\r\n\r\nper   capita   income   in   Asia.   Under   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  our  overseas  Heads  of  Missions\r\n\r\nshould receive emoluments commensurate with  their\r\n\r\nimportance  and  dignified  calling  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nfinancial demands of their office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if it is about time we looked into\r\n\r\nthe matter of getting a cadre of full-time Foreign\r\n\r\nService officers at Head-of-Mission level who  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to serve on a permanent basis. But  this\r\n\r\ncadre  should not be seconded from among Ministers\r\n\r\nof State, Members of Parliament, University staff,\r\n\r\netc. With the possibility of the emergence of this\r\n\r\ncadre of Foreign Service officers, could not a new\r\n\r\nscheme of pay be devised?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I think they  can  do\r\n\r\nbetter  than  what they are doing at  present.  Or\r\n\r\nperhaps if we could increase their salaries,  they\r\n\r\nwill then work hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think what the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson has been saying is less than fair\r\n\r\nto   our   Ambassadors.  They  work   very   hard,\r\n\r\nregardless of whether their salaries are increased\r\n\r\nor  decreased.  However, since both  Members  have\r\n\r\nraised   the  question  of  emoluments   for   our\r\n\r\nAmbassadors and High Commissioners, I  would  like\r\n\r\nto say that, as far as I know there have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  no complaints from them as regards salaries.\r\n\r\nBut   there  have  been  complaints  and   grouses\r\n\r\nregarding their overseas allowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grades and salaries of Heads of Missions are\r\n\r\nequated  with the Civil Service Superscale  Grades\r\n\r\nD,  E and G, i.e., salaries of $2,170, $2,070, and\r\n\r\n$1,920  respectively. This is to  avoid  upsetting\r\n\r\nthe  Government  salary structure and  to  provide\r\n\r\nprospects  of  advancement to higher  grades.  The\r\n\r\ntotal  emoluments  of Heads of  Missions  who  are\r\n\r\nmarried  with,  say,  three children,  range  from\r\n\r\n$3,944.50  to  $5,903 per month  for  a  Grade  II\r\n\r\nAmbassador  or High Commissioner. In  addition  to\r\n\r\nall these, he is provided with rent-free furnished\r\n\r\naccommodation,  a  chauffeur-driven  car  for  his\r\n\r\nexclusive  use, and adequate financial  provisions\r\n\r\nfor entertainment and representational activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the rates for overseas allowances\r\n\r\ndepend  on the cost of living index applicable  to\r\n\r\nthe  country  o posting.

We  must\r\n\r\nhave a mixture of professional diplomats of M.P.s,\r\n\r\nMinisters   of  State,  politicians,  businessmen,\r\n\r\nuniversity dons, etc., so that this wide strata of\r\n\r\nour society can bring in the various valuable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpertise.

So there is no use sending a politician\r\n\r\nto  conduct  matters where commercial  acumen  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  understanding  is  the  more  dominant\r\n\r\nfunction  of an ambassador. As it is,  I  can  say\r\n\r\nthat,  by and large, this experiment in recruiting\r\n\r\nbankers   and  industrialists  has  produced   far\r\n\r\ngreater  results than having a purely professional\r\n\r\ncadre of diplomats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in many other countries too,\r\n\r\nincluding the United States, it is not the  custom\r\n\r\nto  take  the  old  approach that  the  diplomatic\r\n\r\nservice  is  completely  and  wholly  staffed   by\r\n\r\nprofessional  diplomats.

The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs has pointed out just now that  two\r\n\r\nmissions  will  be  set up, one  in  Brussels  and\r\n\r\nanother  in Medan. He has also mentioned  that  an\r\n\r\noverseas  mission  is  set  up  on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nnecessity and of interest to Singapore. I suspect,\r\n\r\nSir,  that the setting up of a mission in Brussels\r\n\r\nis for economic purposes, because the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  has,  in his Budget Statement,  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  be  to our benefit  if  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecomes   an   associate  member  of  the   E.E.C.\r\n\r\n(European  Economic  Community)  or  the  European\r\n\r\nCommon  Market, whose headquarters is in Brussels.\r\n\r\nApart  from  this  benefit, perhaps  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould care to elaborate on the other factors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich necessitate our Government's decision to set\r\n\r\nup a mission in Brussels, and in Medan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is whether\r\n\r\nthese   two   missions  will  be  established   at\r\n\r\nambassadorial  level.  The  reason  is   that   my\r\n\r\nattention   has  been  drawn  to  the  grades   of\r\n\r\nAmbassadors and High Commissioners, discussion  of\r\n\r\nwhich  has  just been concluded under an amendment\r\n\r\nto  subhead  1051.  In this matter,  1  think  the\r\n\r\ngrades  of  our Ambassadors and High Commissioners\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  indicated in  the  Estimates  for\r\n\r\nobvious  reasons, It may well be that we  need  to\r\n\r\nindicate  the  number  of  Ambassadors  and   High\r\n\r\nCommissioners,  and together with it  their  total\r\n\r\npersonal emoluments. But by its inclusion  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Estimates,  as it has been  in  all  these\r\n\r\nyears,  everyone will know that such  and  such  a\r\n\r\nforeign mission is headed by such and such a grade\r\n\r\nof  Ambassador.  I  am  aware  that  some  of  our\r\n\r\nAmbassadors  and High Commissioners are  rendering\r\n\r\ntheir   services   gratis;  I   appreciate   their\r\n\r\ncontribution to Singapore. But I would say that it\r\n\r\nis  unwise  to  classify the different  grades  of\r\n\r\nAmbassadors   and   High  Commissioners   in   the\r\n\r\nEstimates.  Therefore, I hope  that  in  the  next\r\n\r\nyear's estimates we will not be able to know their\r\n\r\nvarious grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to a point which the Minister\r\n\r\nhas  just  replied that there were  no  complaints\r\n\r\nabout  the salaries of Ambassadors, except perhaps\r\n\r\nOverseas Allowances. I take it that there has been\r\n\r\nno  complaints  officially. But  I  have  had  the\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  visit  some  of   our   overseas\r\n\r\nestablishments, and I think it is  high  time  the\r\n\r\nForeign   Ministry  seriously  looked   into   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of providing adequate, if not more  than\r\n\r\nadequate,    overseas   allowances   and    proper\r\n\r\naccommodation for our high officials overseas. For\r\n\r\nexample,  let us take Japan. Our former Ambassador\r\n\r\nto  Japan was put up in an apartment which was,  I\r\n\r\nthink, probably about I X- times the size of a  4-room  Housing  Board flat. I am  not  exaggerating\r\n\r\nbecause on one occasion I paid him a visit at  his\r\n\r\nresidence. I doubt that with such an accommodation\r\n\r\nand surroundings that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  was  provided, and with only a small place  to\r\n\r\npark his car, he would be able to hold an official\r\n\r\nfunction  in his house. I must point out that  the\r\n\r\nAmbassador  concerned did not ask me to  bring  up\r\n\r\nthis   matter.   I  think  this  illustration   is\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Of course, in respect of accommodation,\r\n\r\nthe Foreign Minister might say, \"Look, what is the\r\n\r\nuse  of  having  so much space?

It may well be that since  it\r\n\r\nis  the  first mission in Continental Europe,  our\r\n\r\nmission   in   Brussels   will   have   concurrent\r\n\r\naccreditation  elsewhere  in  Europe,  if  it   is\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Medan, our Mission there is at\r\n\r\nConsulate  level  and,  therefore,  there  is   no\r\n\r\nquestion  of an Ambassador. We want to be  in  the\r\n\r\nbest  of terms with our Indonesian neighbour.  The\r\n\r\nmain  function  of a consulate is to  promote  the\r\n\r\npotential for trade and, in particular, tourism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other comment by the Member concerns the\r\n\r\nemoluments of Heads of Missions, and I have  dealt\r\n\r\nwith this subject. I think the lines for setting a\r\n\r\nstandard for what is comfortable or what  is  not,\r\n\r\nmay  vary. I have also been to what he has  called\r\n\r\n\"a little flat\" of the Ambassador in Tokyo. As far\r\n\r\nas  I  can  see, most flats in Japan  are  \"little\r\n\r\nflats\",  because their concept of  size  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent   from   other  countries.   Many   very\r\n\r\nprominent and wealthy people live in little  flats\r\n\r\nin  Tokyo.  However, I get the point made  by  the\r\n\r\nMember,  and that is, in countries where the  cost\r\n\r\nof  living  is  high  our Ambassadors  should  get\r\n\r\nappropriate  allowances. The cost of living  index\r\n\r\nwas formulated at the time when things were fairly\r\n\r\nstable in Singapore. Many of our bureaucrats  tend\r\n\r\nto think that the cost of living is also stable in\r\n\r\nother  parts  of  the world.

Since the  present\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Labour   took   office,   he   is\r\n\r\nimplementing  two  measures: (1) taking  effective\r\n\r\nsteps  to  reduce  and prevent the  occurrence  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents;  (2)  making  certain  wage\r\n\r\nadjustments and raising the standard of living  of\r\n\r\nlower  income workers. I very much appreciate  the\r\n\r\ntwo  measures  which the Minister is  implementing\r\n\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the prevention of industrial accidents, I\r\n\r\nam  glad  to  see that the Ministry of  Labour  is\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  an  island-wide  industrial  safety\r\n\r\ncampaign  -  as can be seen from the publicity  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers, over radio and T.V, in  order  to\r\n\r\nensure   that   workers  can   work   in   safety.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,   while  the  national   industrial\r\n\r\nsafety  and health campaign is being carried  out,\r\n\r\nthe   number  of  industrial  accidents  occurring\r\n\r\ncontinues  to increase. This is really  an  irony.\r\n\r\nThese industrial accidents include one which  took\r\n\r\nplace  in  Jurong Shipyard recently, resulting  in\r\n\r\nthe  death  of  a  few  workers.  Of  course,   an\r\n\r\noccurrence of this kind of industrial accident  is\r\n\r\nregrettable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many causes of industrial accidents,\r\n\r\ne.g.,  the  machinery is faulty, or the  employers\r\n\r\nand workers have been negligent. All these factors\r\n\r\ncontribute to industrial accidents. Therefore,  in\r\n\r\norder   to   reduce  the  number   of   industrial\r\n\r\naccidents,  the parties concerned should  work  in\r\n\r\nclose  co-operation. I hope the Ministry of Labour\r\n\r\ncan   take   up  a  leading  role  in  encouraging\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  labour to take industrial  safety\r\n\r\nprecautions.  As regards employers  who  disregard\r\n\r\nimplementing  safety measures,  steps  should  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to deal with them. The workers should  make\r\n\r\nuse  of safety devices in order to safeguard their\r\n\r\nown lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister a few\r\n\r\nquestions  and  I  hope he can  give  me  detailed\r\n\r\nanswers.   On   the   prevention   of   industrial\r\n\r\naccidents,  we have been paying much attention  to\r\n\r\nit in the past few years. I would like to know why\r\n\r\nthere were more industrial accidents in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1971  than in 1970.

As regards  the\r\n\r\nJurong Shipyard accident, has the Minister set  up\r\n\r\na  committee of inquiry to look into the causes of\r\n\r\nthe  accident, so that preventive measures may  be\r\n\r\ntaken to prevent similar occurrences?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

He covered a number\r\n\r\nof  sections in the Acts that need to be reviewed,\r\n\r\nnamely,  sections  on  the limitation  of  bonuses\r\n\r\n(this  has  clearly  proved to be  not  workable),\r\n\r\nemployer's  prerogatives on transfers, promotions,\r\n\r\ndismissals,  etc.  I shall not  repeat  except  to\r\n\r\nassociate myself with the sentiments expressed.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister has taken note  of  the  views\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  the Member for Bukit Ho  Swee,  and\r\n\r\nthat  in his reply today he will cover the grounds\r\n\r\nraised by the Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only want to speak on two other sections of\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act - sections 37 (4) and 41(4)  -\r\n\r\nthat  need  to be amended as a matter of  urgency.\r\n\r\nThese  sections  limit financial compensation  for\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the essential services  for  overtime\r\n\r\nwork  performed, when time off cannot  be  granted\r\n\r\nwithin a reasonable period because of the shortage\r\n\r\nof  staff  - many of these departments are  of  an\r\n\r\nessential  nature.  Implementation  of  these  two\r\n\r\nsections  of  the Act has encountered difficulties\r\n\r\nby some Ministries and statutory boards and I will\r\n\r\ngive  details when I speak about these  Ministries\r\n\r\nlater  on.  The  Ministries and  statutory  boards\r\n\r\nconcerned cannot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive time off for overtime work performed, because\r\n\r\nof  serious shortages of staff. At the same  time,\r\n\r\nthe  employees of essential services are  required\r\n\r\nto work and the Act restricts them from being paid\r\n\r\nwages although they are required to perform duties\r\n\r\nover and beyond the 48-hour limitation on overtime\r\n\r\nwork.  Both  these sections of the Employment  Act\r\n\r\nhave  proved  to be unworkable. Will the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider  amending this section of the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct?  Meanwhile,  can  the Permanent  Secretaries,\r\n\r\ndepartmental  heads  and  Chairmen  of   statutory\r\n\r\nboards, be given authority to grant overtime,  and\r\n\r\nto  pay  for overtime if no time off can be  given\r\n\r\nwithin a reasonable period?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise to speak on a subject to  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has  not  made  any  direct\r\n\r\nreference but which is very close to the hearts of\r\n\r\nworkers. In his Budget Statement, the Minister has\r\n\r\ngiven  credit  to the workers for  the  role  they\r\n\r\nplayed in the economic success of Singapore during\r\n\r\nthe past few years. The Minister has also gone  on\r\n\r\nto   say  that  it  has  been  necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  relax  its  stringent  immigration\r\n\r\npolicies  in  respect of workers who  possess  the\r\n\r\nskill   or  expertise  required  in  the  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of Singapore. The general  impression\r\n\r\nconveyed by the painless Budget presented to  this\r\n\r\nHouse   is  that  Singapore  is  enjoying  booming\r\n\r\nconditions   and   that  we  are  experiencing   a\r\n\r\nsituation  of full employment. Thus, by inference,\r\n\r\nworkers  should not have difficulty  in  obtaining\r\n\r\nample opportunities for suitable employment. While\r\n\r\nit  is  true to say that the level of unemployment\r\n\r\nhas  gone  down  to a point that would  have  been\r\n\r\nunimaginable two or three years ago, there remains\r\n\r\ncertain  categories of labour  which  cannot  find\r\n\r\nemployment  in  the  present  situation  of   full\r\n\r\nemployment. Such categories of labour are of a non-industrial variety or are not in possession of the\r\n\r\nskill or expertise which is much in demand now,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  are unsuitable by reason of education, age  or\r\n\r\nhealth. Even apart from the consideration  that  a\r\n\r\nworker  presently in gainful employment  may  have\r\n\r\ngreat    difficulty   in   obtaining   alternative\r\n\r\nemployment in the event of being deprived  of  his\r\n\r\npresent job, a worker will normally object to  his\r\n\r\nemployment  being  terminated by  an  employer  on\r\n\r\ngrounds which are not due to any act or conduct of\r\n\r\nthe worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of my speech today is to bring the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  House  to  the  grievances  of\r\n\r\nworkers  that the right to dismiss or  retrench  a\r\n\r\nworker  has been somewhat abused by a considerable\r\n\r\nnumber  of employers in obvious disregard  to  the\r\n\r\nwelfare or interest of the worker. In some  cases,\r\n\r\nit may be even said that dismissal or retrenchment\r\n\r\nhas  been effected in circumstances tantamount  to\r\n\r\nvictimisation. Members of the House may think that\r\n\r\nwe have adequate legislation to protect workers in\r\n\r\nthe  event  of  victimisation, but the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  such  legislation does not  necessarily\r\n\r\nmean  that  it  is effective for the purposes  for\r\n\r\nwhich it is intended. Moreover, even if' there  is\r\n\r\neffective   legislation  for  the  protection   of\r\n\r\nworkers against victimisation there is at present,\r\n\r\nas  the law stands, no remedy for workers who find\r\n\r\nthemselves  thrown  out of employment  through  no\r\n\r\nfault   of  their  own,  but  who  cannot   allege\r\n\r\nvictimisation by the employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that those Members of the House who are\r\n\r\nnot  employers,  or who have no occasion  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  employer! employee relationship, may have  a\r\n\r\nclear  picture  of  the problem of  insecurity  of\r\n\r\nemployment,  which  is  a haunting  fear  assuming\r\n\r\nnightmarish  proportions to  workers  with  family\r\n\r\nobligations and hire purchase commitments,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for me to give a brief outline  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation in which a contract of employment may be\r\n\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 10 of the Employment Act, it is\r\n\r\nprovided  that  an  employer or  an  employee  may\r\n\r\nterminate  a contract of employment by  giving  to\r\n\r\nthe other party the right of notice of not less\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan one day or not more than one month, depending\r\n\r\non  the  length  of service of a worker  affected.\r\n\r\nSuch  length of notice, of course, may be  greater\r\n\r\nthan that provided under the Employment Act, if an\r\n\r\nindividual  contract  of employment  contains  any\r\n\r\nprovision  to that effect. In the absence  of  any\r\n\r\nsuch  contractual provision, the length of  notice\r\n\r\nmay   be  governed  by  the  Employment  Act.  The\r\n\r\nprovisions  of section 10 are as fair  as  can  be\r\n\r\ndesired. Both the employer and the worker have  an\r\n\r\nequal right and correspondingly equal duty to give\r\n\r\nthe  same  notice of termination  of  contract  of\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snag, however, lies in the provision of\r\n\r\nsubsection  (2)  of section 17 of  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations Act, which provides for the right of  an\r\n\r\nemployer  to terminate the services of workers  on\r\n\r\nthe   grounds   of  redundancy  or  reorganisation\r\n\r\nwithout   having  to  prove  such  redundancy   or\r\n\r\nreorganisation. Thus, under the existing  laws  an\r\n\r\nemployer can call upon a worker, who may have been\r\n\r\nemployed for more than 10 years, and say  to  him,\r\n\r\n\"I hereby give you a month's notice, in accordance\r\n\r\nwith   the  Industrial  Relations  Act,  for   the\r\n\r\ntermination  of  the contract of  service  on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds of redundancy or reorganisation as  I  may\r\n\r\nwish  to choose.\" And the worker has no remedy  to\r\n\r\nthe  court even though he knows very well and  can\r\n\r\nprove   that  there  is  no  such  redundancy   or\r\n\r\nreorganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my own personal experience, I have come\r\n\r\nacross   many  cases  where  an  employer,   after\r\n\r\nterminating  the  services  of  a  worker  on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  of  redundancy, proceeds within  a  short\r\n\r\ntime  thereafter to recruit new workers under  new\r\n\r\ndesignations  to perform the same  work  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen done by the ex-worker who has been retrenched\r\n\r\non  the grounds of redundancy. What makes it worse\r\n\r\nis  that the employer, who may be a director of  a\r\n\r\nwell-established company, will have no  qualms  to\r\n\r\necho  the  refrain of the Government that  workers\r\n\r\nmust  make sacrifices for the general good of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members of the House may still wonder why\r\n\r\nit  is  still so unfair of an employer to exercise\r\n\r\nhis powers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  section 17 (2) of the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nAct, i.e., to terminate the services of workers on\r\n\r\ngrounds  of redundancy or reorganisation.  We  may\r\n\r\nalso  say  that there is nothing to stop a  worker\r\n\r\nfrom terminating his contract of employment, if he\r\n\r\nso desires. There are, however, two considerations\r\n\r\nwhich may put the matter in a different light. One\r\n\r\nis  that, with the generally accepted practice  of\r\n\r\nemployment  in  Singapore to  grant  a  worker  an\r\n\r\nincremental  salary scale, a worker who  has  been\r\n\r\nemployed  for  several years  expects  to  draw  a\r\n\r\nsalary  considerably higher  than  that  which  he\r\n\r\nobtains  at  the  commencement of his  employment.\r\n\r\nHowever,   some  employers  feel  that  they   are\r\n\r\nentitled  to  effect  savings by  terminating  the\r\n\r\nservices  of  workers who have been  employed  for\r\n\r\nseveral  years and replacing them with  little  or\r\n\r\ninexperienced  workers at far lower salaries.  The\r\n\r\ndamage  done to a worker whose services have  been\r\n\r\nterminated may be irreparable, particularly if  he\r\n\r\nbelongs to a category of labour which is not  much\r\n\r\nin   demand.   If  he  is  lucky  he  may   obtain\r\n\r\nalternative employment with a far lower salary, or\r\n\r\nhe  may  join  the  ranks of the  unemployed  even\r\n\r\nthough  he  may have many years of active  service\r\n\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other situation is that if the workers are\r\n\r\nin  possession of a skill, which is very  much  in\r\n\r\ndemand,  and  if  they are to  take  joint  action\r\n\r\nagainst an employer in support of their colleague,\r\n\r\nwho  has  been  given a raw deal by the  employer,\r\n\r\nthen  by  jointly terminating their  services  and\r\n\r\nseek alternative employment, the employer will  be\r\n\r\nthe  first to cry \"blue murder\" and would urge the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour  to  intervene  in  what   he\r\n\r\nconstitutes   an   industrial   action.   Such   a\r\n\r\nhypothetical  situation envisaged  by  me  is  not\r\n\r\nlikely   to   occur,  not  because   it   involves\r\n\r\nindustrial  action which is prohibited in  respect\r\n\r\nof termination of service, but because workers are\r\n\r\ngenerally  more  responsible than  that.  But  the\r\n\r\nanticipated  reaction  of  employers  to  such   a\r\n\r\nhypothetical situation is not at all far-fetched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you may recall the agitation of employers\r\n\r\nover the high turnover of labour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin   the  industrial  establishment  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nduring the past few years, you will readily  agree\r\n\r\nwith  me  that  employers  were  not  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconcede  to  a worker the right of termination  of\r\n\r\ncontract of employment. That is exactly what  some\r\n\r\nemployers  have  suggested as a  solution  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of high turnover of industrial labour  by\r\n\r\ndepriving  the  worker of the right  to  terminate\r\n\r\nemployment. Then it may be argued that while trade\r\n\r\nunions   are   debarred  from   negotiating   with\r\n\r\nemployers  or are prohibited from having  recourse\r\n\r\nto  any industrial action over any termination  of\r\n\r\nservice, there are statutory provisions to  afford\r\n\r\nadequate  remedy to any aggrieved trade  union  or\r\n\r\nits  members.  Under section 35 of the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Act, it is provided that if a dismissal\r\n\r\nhas  been  effected in circumstances amounting  to\r\n\r\nvictimisation of the dismissed worker, proceedings\r\n\r\ncan  be  commenced  in the Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  for  the  reinstatement  of  the  dismissed\r\n\r\nworker.  Similarly, if a worker has been dismissed\r\n\r\nby  an  employer without just cause or  excuse,  a\r\n\r\nrepresentation  can  be made to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  for  the  reinstatement of  the  dismissed\r\n\r\nworker. There are, however, three main aspects -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your ten minutes are up, Mr Cheong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Owing to\r\n\r\nthe  pullout of British Forces, the Government has\r\n\r\nintroduced very strict labour laws in 1968,  which\r\n\r\nmore  or less muzzled our workers. After they have\r\n\r\nproved their worth and after having sacrificed  so\r\n\r\nmuch  for  the  State, it is time  to  change  our\r\n\r\nlabour  laws  which  are  disadvantageous  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers who are open to exploitation by employers.\r\n\r\nI quote one example. An employee,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho has a malicious intent on a fellow worker, can\r\n\r\neasily complain to the employer in confidence. The\r\n\r\nemployer can suspend the worker for any length  of\r\n\r\ntime    under    the   pretext    of    conducting\r\n\r\ninvestigations. If a worker has been suspended for\r\n\r\na  period  of seven days, then by law  he  can  be\r\n\r\ndismissed.    Unfortunately,   some   unscrupulous\r\n\r\nemployers  have  exploited  this  law   to   their\r\n\r\nadvantage. It is my wish that amendments  be  made\r\n\r\nin  regard to this aspect of the law. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nif  a worker is interdicted and charged in a court\r\n\r\nof  law,  he  may be found not guilty and  thereby\r\n\r\nacquitted  and discharged. By right he  should  be\r\n\r\nreinstated   in   his   former   employment,   but\r\n\r\nunfortunately this is not the case.  The  employer\r\n\r\nhas again exploited the poor worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  must thank the Members for Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nand  Toa Payoh for supporting my request to  amend\r\n\r\nthe  Employment  Act and the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nAct  on  the negotiability of bonus and to  remove\r\n\r\nthe managerial prerogative. Sir, yesterday I spoke\r\n\r\non  the  Budget Statement and gave reasons  why  I\r\n\r\nrequested amendments to the Employment Act and  to\r\n\r\nsection 17 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act, so\r\n\r\nthat  the  union can negotiate with the management\r\n\r\non  the annual bonus up to three months instead of\r\n\r\none  month  only,  and  to remove  the  managerial\r\n\r\nprerogative  so  as  to  stop  the  employer  from\r\n\r\nabusing  them.  It  is  a  well  known  fact  that\r\n\r\nemployers  can easily victimise the  employees  by\r\n\r\nusing this prerogative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister for Labour to\r\n\r\ntell  us whether he will agree to amend provisions\r\n\r\nin the Employment Act and Industrial Relations Act\r\n\r\nso  as  to  enable the unions to negotiate  annual\r\n\r\nbonus  up  to  three  months  and  to  remove  the\r\n\r\nmanagerial prerogative immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang has touched\r\n\r\non  the  question of industrial accidents  and  he\r\n\r\nasked  why  the  rate of industrial accidents  has\r\n\r\ngone  up  in  1971  as against 1970,  despite  the\r\n\r\ncampaign introduced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby   the   Ministry  with  a  view  to   reducing\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents. The main reasons  for  the\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of industrial accidents in\r\n\r\n1971  can be attributed as follows. Firstly,  the\r\n\r\nrapid   expansion  of  our  industries  and   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  boom  have compelled  employers  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  workers indiscriminately. Most of  these\r\n\r\nworkers  have  very little or no formal  training\r\n\r\nprior  to  their being put on the job.  As  such,\r\n\r\nthey were more accident-prone, being ignorant  of\r\n\r\nthe   working   technique,  safety   and   health\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Secondly, the shortage of  experienced\r\n\r\nand  qualified  supervisors at the factory  floor\r\n\r\nand  worksites,  and  the new  and  inexperienced\r\n\r\nworker  who  is  often  left  alone  to  acquaint\r\n\r\nhimself with the job on a trial and error  basis,\r\n\r\ncan  be regarded as contributory factors. In many\r\n\r\ncases  accidents  occur  because  employers  have\r\n\r\nwilfully   neglected   to  provide   or   install\r\n\r\nprescribed safety devices. Finally, in the larger\r\n\r\nnumber of cases reported, the accidents were  due\r\n\r\nto  the  irresponsible attitude  of  workers  who\r\n\r\nfailed  to use and wear safety equipment provided\r\n\r\nby the employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by the Member for Sembawang, the\r\n\r\nMinistry   has  recently  organised  a   two-week\r\n\r\ncampaign  on  industrial safety. At  the  opening\r\n\r\nceremony  of the campaign on 1st March,  1972.  1\r\n\r\noutlined  a three-prong strategy which  would  be\r\n\r\nput  into  operation  to  reduce  the  number  of\r\n\r\nindustrial   accidents  occurring  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBriefly,  an intensive period of social education\r\n\r\nwould be mounted to bring home to the public  the\r\n\r\nhigh  social  and  economic  cost  of  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents.  Workers would he helped to  form  new\r\n\r\nand correct work attitudes and made to appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  need  for personal safety in their  everyday\r\n\r\nworking  life.  Employers would  be  reminded  of\r\n\r\ntheir  duties and responsibilities to  provide  a\r\n\r\nsafe,  clean  and  healthy  working  environment.\r\n\r\nAppropriate  legislation to  provide  for  higher\r\n\r\nstandards of safety, health and welfare, would he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrawn  up.  In fact, the Building Operations  and\r\n\r\nWorks  of  Engineering Construction  Regulations,\r\n\r\n1971,    have   already   been   enacted.   These\r\n\r\nregulations   were  drawn  up   specifically   to\r\n\r\novercome  the problem of high accident  rates  in\r\n\r\nthe building and construction trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Factories Bill, to replace the Factories\r\n\r\nOrdinance   enacted  in  1958, has   just   been\r\n\r\nintroduced earlier this afternoon. The  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Act, which was amended  last  year.\r\n\r\nwould   be  trebling  the  quantum  of  workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation payable, and force employers  to  be\r\n\r\nmore   conscious  in  providing  adequate  safety\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Consideration is also being  given  to\r\n\r\nthe   drawing  up  of  separate  regulations  for\r\n\r\nSpecific  industries, such as sand  blasting  and\r\n\r\nquarrying  operations, to ensure that workers  in\r\n\r\nthese industries .are fully protected. Whilst the\r\n\r\nFactories  Bill  will  set  higher  standards  of\r\n\r\nsafety,  health and welfare, and  ensure  a  more\r\n\r\nstringent observance of these provisions, it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary for the Factory Inspectorate and Health\r\n\r\nUnit  to  carry  Out more vigorous  and  frequent\r\n\r\nchecks on factories and worksites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for Sembawang,\r\n\r\nmore   posts  of  Factory  Inspectors  and  other\r\n\r\nsubordinate staff have been created.  There  will\r\n\r\nbe  no  letup in bringing to book both  employers\r\n\r\nand workers found contravening the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Factories  Act. The proposed Factories  Bill\r\n\r\nstipulates the employment of safety officers  and\r\n\r\nthe  formation  of industrial safety  committees.\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Labour, in conjunction with  the\r\n\r\nNational   Productivity  Centre, will   conduct\r\n\r\nappropriate  training courses  for  these  safety\r\n\r\npersonnel  to supplement the work of the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate, by emphasising on  the  preventive\r\n\r\naspects of accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However. I must reiterate that the Government on\r\n\r\nits  Owl:  cannot fight the battle to reduce  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  industrial  accidents.  Management  and\r\n\r\ntrade unions must also share and play their  role\r\n\r\nin  keeping Singapore industrial safe, clean  and\r\n\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the accident in Jurong Shipyard is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  I  think the Member for  Sembawang  is\r\n\r\naware that the Government  has already appointed a\r\n\r\ncommittee  of  inquiry  to  investigate  into  the\r\n\r\nnature  and  causes  of the accident.  When  their\r\n\r\nfindings are known, appropriate measures  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken, and I hope sonic preventive steps could  be\r\n\r\ntaken to prevent such occurrences in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has touched on\r\n\r\nsections 37 (4) and 41 (4) of the Employment  Act.\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  employees  of  Government  or\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies  who  are engaged  in  essential\r\n\r\nservices are presently prohibited from payment for\r\n\r\nwork  done  on rest days or public holidays  under\r\n\r\nthese two sections of the Employment Act. Instead,\r\n\r\nthey   are  given  an  equivalent  time   off   in\r\n\r\nsubstitution.   I think the Member is  aware  that\r\n\r\nthe  AUPE, which represents employees the  public\r\n\r\nsector, has taken up this matter with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Finance, and certain compromised solutions were\r\n\r\noffered  although not to the satisfaction  of  the AUPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sections 37 (4) and 41 (4) of\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act, restricting payment for  work\r\n\r\ndone on rest days and public holidays to employees\r\n\r\nof Government or statutory bodies, were introduced\r\n\r\nin  1968, primarily to prevent malingering  which\r\n\r\nwas then widespread among employees engaged in the\r\n\r\nessential  services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,I think the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  not quit answered my  question.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that  sections 37 (4) and  4!  (4)  are  not\r\n\r\noperable.  We cannot operate under those sections.\r\n\r\nWe  have  tried to do so since 1968. The  Minister\r\n\r\nshould he aware of it as the NTUC had sent  him  a\r\n\r\nmemorandum    on   it.   We   have    also    made\r\n\r\nrepresentations to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Act provides for time off in lieu\r\n\r\nthe  major  Departments involved.   Ministries  of\r\n\r\nFinance.   National  Development,  Communications.\r\n\r\nTelecommunications and statutory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboards  like  the P.U.B, and P.S.A, cannot  follow\r\n\r\nthe  law. Is the Minister suggesting that  because\r\n\r\nwe do not amend the Act, then these Ministries and\r\n\r\nstatutory boards should break our own law? This is\r\n\r\nwhat  will  happen. We should either  not  request\r\n\r\nthem  to  work on public holidays, in  which  case\r\n\r\nessential services will be interrupted,  or  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  work and pay them for it.  But  the  law\r\n\r\nprevents them from being paid. We have come to  an\r\n\r\nimpasse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore. I suggest one or two ways to solve\r\n\r\nthis  problem. One is a ministerial  directive  to\r\n\r\nallow  the  Permanent Secretaries and Chairmen  of\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards to use their initiative  to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  overtime worked by employees whom they cannot\r\n\r\ngive  time  off in lieu. And if they  cannot  pay,\r\n\r\nthen amend the Act.

I was giving reasons as to why these  two\r\n\r\nSections  of the Employment Act were in t  roil  u\r\n\r\n::ed. Before the introduction of these provisions,\r\n\r\nthere was considerable malingering  in those  days\r\n\r\nand  there was high absenteeism on normal  working\r\n\r\ndays,  so  that  work could he accumulated  to  be\r\n\r\nperformed  on  rest  days a nil  public  holidays,\r\n\r\nwhich  attracted higher rates of pay: I think  the\r\n\r\nrate was treble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, time and circumstances have changed.\r\n\r\nWe  are approaching full employment. Consequently,\r\n\r\nI   think  these  essential  services  have  found\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  recruiting sufficient  workers  to\r\n\r\nperform  the  job, and as a result employees  were\r\n\r\ncalled  upon  to work overtime on  rest  days.  In\r\n\r\nfact, this matter is now under consideration,  and\r\n\r\nwe  have  made  our views known  to  the  relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the reasons for introducing\r\n\r\nthese two sections have been considered thoroughly\r\n\r\nat  that time. Any amendment now would require due\r\n\r\nconsideration and consultation with  the  relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities.  I  can assure the Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  that the question he has raised  will  be\r\n\r\nthoroughly gone into. In fact, before coming here,\r\n\r\nI  was  informed  by one statutory authority  that\r\n\r\nthey had taken active steps to recruit workers  to\r\n\r\nfill up the establishment so that the workers will\r\n\r\nnot  be  called upon to perform work on rest  days\r\n\r\nand public holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of wages and bonus has been\r\n\r\noccupying  the minds of Government for some  time.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Bukit  Ho  Swee  is  aware  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  made  its  views  known  to   the\r\n\r\nNational  Wages  Council.  We  are  awaiting   its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  as to whether  the  present  one-month  limit on the negotiability of bonus  should\r\n\r\nhe  raised and, if so, what should be the ceiling.\r\n\r\nUntil  the views of the Council are known,  it  is\r\n\r\npremature  now  to consider any amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have touched on the employers'\r\n\r\nprerogative  to  hire and hre staff.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, when the Industrial Relations Act was amended\r\n\r\nin 1968 to render certain management functions not\r\n\r\nnegotiable,  it  was generally accepted  that  the\r\n\r\namendments  were  necessary `to  allow  management\r\n\r\nfunctions  to be properly performed and unhindered\r\n\r\nas  otherwise there would be little or no economic\r\n\r\nexpansion or fresh investments coming in. Besides,\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestoring to employers the right to hire or  fire,\r\n\r\nto  promote and transfer employees, no rights were\r\n\r\ntaken  away  from  the workers. They  were  merely\r\n\r\namendments  to the common rights of management  to\r\n\r\nadministrate and now made into statute law.  As  a\r\n\r\nsafeguard  against  abuse  on  firing   at   will,\r\n\r\nprovisions were made, now contained in section  35\r\n\r\nof  the  Industrial Relations Act,  for  a  speedy\r\n\r\nredress for employees who consider that they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  dismissed  by their employers  without  just\r\n\r\ncause or reason. By virtue of this provision,  all\r\n\r\ncases  of dismissal or termination of service  may\r\n\r\nbe  made, if a trade union so desires, the subject\r\n\r\nof a representation in writing to the Minister for\r\n\r\nthe reinstatement of the dismissed employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the three full years of the\r\n\r\noperation  of  this  provision,  a  total  of   74\r\n\r\nrepresentations  have been made by  trade  unions,\r\n\r\nunder  section 35 (2) of the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nAct,  for  the reinstatement of 141 employees  who\r\n\r\nconsidered that they had been dismissed  by  their\r\n\r\nemployers  without just cause or  excuse.  Thirty-four   representations  resulted  in  an  amicable\r\n\r\nsettlement, while another 17 were withdrawn by the\r\n\r\ntrade    unions   themselves.    Four    of    the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  were disposed of  by  Ministerial\r\n\r\norder  for  their  reinstatement or  compensations\r\n\r\npaid.  In another 15 representations, the Minister\r\n\r\nfound  no  sufficient  reason  to  intervene.  The\r\n\r\nremaining   four  representations  are   presently\r\n\r\nreceiving attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these figures show that the\r\n\r\nsituation is not so serious as to justify  further\r\n\r\namendments to the Industrial Relations Act at this\r\n\r\njuncture. However, the Ministry will continue  its\r\n\r\nvigilance on the industrial scene and, if the need\r\n\r\narises,   will   take  prompt  action,   including\r\n\r\nlegislative   measures,  to  ensure   that   these\r\n\r\nmanagement rights are not abused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nafraid!  the Minister has not answered  the  point\r\n\r\nwith regard to the retrenchment exercise conducted\r\n\r\nby employers.

But I am rather surprised to see that\r\n\r\nunder  this  subhead the number of posts  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased slightly, that is, from six to eight.  I\r\n\r\ndoubt whether these two additional Inspectors  are\r\n\r\ngoing to do much good in view of the fact that, as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has just mentioned, there will be  a\r\n\r\nseries of new rules and regulations coming out  in\r\n\r\nthe ensuing year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the number of Inspectors to\r\n\r\nenforce the rules and regulations, there is, to my\r\n\r\nmind,  the more important problem of whether these\r\n\r\nInspectors  are adequately trained. What  sort  of\r\n\r\ntraining do we give them? There is no provision to\r\n\r\nsend them abroad for training. As I see it, if our\r\n\r\nInspectors of Factories are to be effective,  they\r\n\r\nshould  assume  not  only  the  functions  of  law\r\n\r\nenforcers  but  they should also  be  able  to  go\r\n\r\nfurther  and advise the factories on the types  of\r\n\r\nsafety  measures  to be taken. The  big  factories\r\n\r\nwill  have  their own officials to look  into  the\r\n\r\nproblem of safety measures. But in the case of the\r\n\r\nsmall  factories,  however,  the  Ministry  should\r\n\r\nprovide  every assistance in this respect whenever\r\n\r\nsuch advice is required. In view of the increasing\r\n\r\ncomplexity in our manufacturing processes, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrongly  urge  the  Minister to  look  into  this\r\n\r\nquestion of training for our Inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect of industrial safety. I\r\n\r\nhave  heard  that  some of the  industrial  safety\r\n\r\nequipment  available in the market do  not  really\r\n\r\ncome  up  to  the required standard, for  example,\r\n\r\nsafety belts and safety helmets. Some of them  are\r\n\r\njust put on for ornamental reasons to satisfy  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the Inspectors. When you put these\r\n\r\nbelts  or helmets to the real test, you will  find\r\n\r\nthat  they are really not suitable or ineffective.\r\n\r\nHere  again,  I  urge the Minister to  direct  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  look  into the  suitability  of  the\r\n\r\nsafety  equipment. There must be quality  control,\r\n\r\nso  to  speak, and I am sure the Member for Katong\r\n\r\nwill be most interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that\r\n\r\nthe  Factories Act is jointly administered by  the\r\n\r\nFactory  Inspectorate  and the  Industrial  Health\r\n\r\nUnit  of the Ministry of Labour. While it is  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  number of Inspectors of  Factories  has\r\n\r\nonly  increased from six to eight,  an  additional\r\n\r\npost  of  Inspector of Factories has been  created\r\n\r\nfor  the  Industrial Health Unit. In  addition  to\r\n\r\nthese posts, a Civil engineer from the P.W.D, will\r\n\r\nbe  seconded to the Factory Inspectorate,  through\r\n\r\nspecial arrangements; making the total increase to\r\n\r\nfour  Inspectors of Factories. Besides, the  staff\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Industrial Health Unit is  to\r\n\r\nbe  increased  by one Health Officer,  one  Senior\r\n\r\nPublic  Health  Inspector,  one  Sister  and   one\r\n\r\nExecutive   Officer.   With   the   abovementioned\r\n\r\nincreases in the staff establishment, the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate and the Industrial Health  Unit  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to take on the additional workload  that\r\n\r\nwill result from the introduction of the Factories\r\n\r\nBill. Notwithstanding this, the Ministry will also\r\n\r\nreview from time to time the staffing position  of\r\n\r\nthese   two   departments  and  to   rectify   any\r\n\r\ninadequacies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I stress that however stringently we may\r\n\r\nenforce the proposed Factories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct,  by  increasing  the  staff  of  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate and the Industrial Health  Unit,  the\r\n\r\nproblem of industrial safety and health can  never\r\n\r\nbe   solved  by  law  enforcement  alone,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister has mentioned a few minutes ago.  In  the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis,  industrial safety  requires  the\r\n\r\nconcerted effort of everybody concerned - workers,\r\n\r\ntrade unions, employers, and the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the training of new Inspectors, at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  we  do not have plans  to  send  them\r\n\r\nabroad.

With  regard  to\r\n\r\nadvisers,  we  are looking around to  see  whether\r\n\r\nthere  are suitably qualified and competent people\r\n\r\nto assist us in the training of these officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding safety equipment, which the Member has\r\n\r\nalleged  that they are just used for show,  may  I\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  have  the  Singapore  Institute  of\r\n\r\nStandards and Industrial Research and that perhaps\r\n\r\nsome of the safety equipment should bear the stamp\r\n\r\nof  that Institute.

This is to  enable  more\r\n\r\nforeign   workers  to  enter  Singapore  to   seek\r\n\r\nemployment in order to meet the labour needs of  a\r\n\r\nhighly  industrialised  society.  But  in  certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances  there is room for improvement.  For\r\n\r\nexample, there are foreign workers who have worked\r\n\r\nin  Singapore for many, many years, and have  even\r\n\r\nmarried  Singapore citizens and living with  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  in Singapore. But these foreign  workers\r\n\r\nhave  not been able to get work permits when  they\r\n\r\napply.  This  is a great blow to their livelihood.\r\n\r\nIt  is  my  hope  that the Minister will  consider\r\n\r\ntheir  applications for work permits, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that they are living in Singapore  with\r\n\r\nchildren and wives who are Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should understand that the present\r\n\r\nlabour  shortage in Singapore is not only felt  in\r\n\r\nthe  industrial sector but also in the  commercial\r\n\r\nsector,  e.g, in the retail shops. We  are  still\r\n\r\nshort  of  shop assistants, and even  barbers  and\r\n\r\ndomestic servants. There is a shortage of  similar\r\n\r\ncategories  of  workers as  well.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  in  charge of  the  Work  Permits\r\n\r\nOffice   should,  when  considering  applications,\r\n\r\nunderstand the actual position and appreciate  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the various commercial houses so  as  to\r\n\r\nenable them to get the necessary workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other questions which I wish to raise\r\n\r\nwith  the Minister. Firstly, how many work permits\r\n\r\nhave  been  issued to-date? Can the Minister  tell\r\n\r\nthis  House how many work permits have been issued\r\n\r\nfor  the  different  categories  of  workers,  for\r\n\r\nexample, skilled and unskilled workers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I think it is the policy to\r\n\r\nsympathetically  consider  applications  for  work\r\n\r\npermits   by  non-citizens  who  are  married   to\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  having children born in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  policy  also applies to foreign workers  who\r\n\r\nhave families in Singapore, as long as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication  does not jeopardise the  interest  of\r\n\r\nour own citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the figures, I can only give the\r\n\r\nMember the figure as at 29th February, 1972.

These\r\n\r\npeople  are holders of blue identity cards and  it\r\n\r\nis  clearly  stated in their identity  cards  that\r\n\r\ntheir  place  of  birth  is  Singapore.  The  only\r\n\r\ndifficulty is that they cannot produce evidence of\r\n\r\nbirth   or  citizenship  certificate,  but   their\r\n\r\ncountry  of The same amendment also stood  in  the\r\n\r\nKah  Ting, birth is clearly stated as  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWith this, Sir, it means that the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nNational Registration accepts the fact that  these\r\n\r\npeople were born in Singapore. The only difficulty\r\n\r\nis that they cannot produce evidence of birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people were raised in Singapore, they went\r\n\r\nto  school in Singapore and they have the required\r\n\r\nresidential  qualifications. They  have  undergone\r\n\r\nthe  way  of life in Singapore and their situation\r\n\r\nis  similar to those who hold pink identity cards.\r\n\r\nBut  I  regret  that when these people  apply  for\r\n\r\njobs,  whether  in  Government departments  or  in\r\n\r\nprivate firms, their applications are rejected  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  that they are not Singapore  citizens.\r\n\r\nThe  departments and firms which are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nemploy them often ask for work permits, and  there\r\n\r\nare times when their applications for work permits\r\n\r\nare rejected by the authorities on the ground that\r\n\r\nthe  work can be done by holders of Singapore pink\r\n\r\nidentity cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the time has come for the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour to consider exempting these people from\r\n\r\nwork  permit  requirements, so that  they  can  be\r\n\r\ngiven   equal  treatment  with  holders  of   pink\r\n\r\nidentity cards with regard to securing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployment so that the economy of the Republic  can\r\n\r\nbe  further boosted and, at the same time alleviate\r\n\r\nthe  burden  of some of our citizens.

I believe that  at\r\n\r\npresent  there  is  a scheme administered  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour  for  the  rehabilitation  of\r\n\r\ndisabled  persons. The scheme was first introduced\r\n\r\nin 1953 and apparently it is the same scheme which\r\n\r\nwe  still  have today, though so much has  changed\r\n\r\nover  the years. Judging by the latest report from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Labour, very few disabled persons\r\n\r\nseem  to  have  taken advantage of the  facilities\r\n\r\navailable.  This  does seem to  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  or  services available  might  not  be\r\n\r\nreally  suitable for present day  needs,  or  that\r\n\r\nthey  are not really good enough. I would like  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  opportunity of urging the  Minister  to\r\n\r\ngive particular attention to this area, which very\r\n\r\nmuch  relates to the rate of industrial accidents.\r\n\r\nReading  the Ministry's report for the year  1970,\r\n\r\nif  I  remember correctly, only about  31  persons\r\n\r\ntook  advantage  of the training. If  you  compare\r\n\r\nthis number of 31 disabled persons with the number\r\n\r\nof disabled persons in another part of the report,\r\n\r\nit  does  seem  that  a very small  percentage  of\r\n\r\npersons sustaining permanent disablement has taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of the training programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, first of all, let me give a\r\n\r\npicture  of  what is happening and what  has  been\r\n\r\ndone in this particular section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme for the Rehabilitation and Retraining\r\n\r\nof Disabled Persons renders assistance to disabled\r\n\r\npersons suffering from any form of disability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncaused by accidents or disease. Such assistance is\r\n\r\naimed   at   helping  them  to   regain   economic\r\n\r\nindependence by undergoing courses of training  in\r\n\r\ntrade  which  will  enable them  to  be  gainfully\r\n\r\nemployed on completion of their training. Training\r\n\r\nis  normally fixed for a period of six  months  in\r\n\r\nthe first instance, with possible extension of one\r\n\r\nto  three  months,  and in exceptional  cases  for\r\n\r\nlonger periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year 1971, 30 disabled persons were\r\n\r\nplaced  for  training under the  scheme  in  seven\r\n\r\ndifferent trades. Of these, eight completed  their\r\n\r\ntraining   and  found  employment.  Eight   others\r\n\r\ndiscontinued  their  training  due  to   loss   of\r\n\r\ninterest.  The  remaining 14  will  continue  with\r\n\r\ntheir  training  in  1972.  Under  the  scheme,  a\r\n\r\ntrainee  obtains  a subsistence  allowance  and  a\r\n\r\ntransport allowance. The cost of training for  the\r\n\r\nyear amounted to $7,222.13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Member for Jalan Kayu that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Labour will be prepared to expand  the\r\n\r\nscheme  for  the rehabilitation and retraining  of\r\n\r\ndisabled  persons if there is a  demand  for  such\r\n\r\ntraining.  While  training is one  aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem,   the  more  important  aspect   is   the\r\n\r\nemployment   opportunities  available   for   such\r\n\r\ntrained  persons. It is hoped that employers  will\r\n\r\novercome certain prejudices and readily offer jobs\r\n\r\nto disabled persons who have been retrained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, may I put forward a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  to  the Minister of State  for  Labour\r\n\r\nwith regard to the employment of disabled persons?\r\n\r\nAs  you are aware, in Singapore there are a lot of\r\n\r\nmulti-storey buildings coming up, particularly the\r\n\r\nshopping  complexes, where lifts are installed.  I\r\n\r\nwonder   whether   the  Ministry  can   discourage\r\n\r\nemployers from employing able-bodied men  as  lift\r\n\r\nattendants, and so give the opportunity  to  these\r\n\r\ndisabled people. In fact, we notice that  even  in\r\n\r\nGovernment buildings the lift attendants are able-bodied men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Yes, Sir, wherever possible,\r\n\r\nthese disabled persons, who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  capable  of  working as lift attendants,  are\r\n\r\ngiven  priority  of  employment.  But  there   are\r\n\r\ncertain cases where employers do not want  to  use\r\n\r\nthem  for various reasons and we cannot force them\r\n\r\nto accept these people. However, we will certainly\r\n\r\ngive them priority if we have the power to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I am just wondering why\r\n\r\nsuch  a  small number of persons make use  of  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  there. Could it be that there  is  not\r\n\r\nenough  publicity? A lot of people are  not  aware\r\n\r\nthat there is such a scheme in existence. Has  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  made an effort to try and find  out  the\r\n\r\nreasons? Reading through the report, I cannot help\r\n\r\nfeeling  that even the Ministry itself is doubtful\r\n\r\nas  to  why  only  eight out of  30  finished  the\r\n\r\ntraining course. Is there any follow-up survey  to\r\n\r\nfind  out  why  only eight stayed on  to  complete\r\n\r\ntheir training?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> As I said earlier, Sir, some of\r\n\r\nthem  lose interest very quickly. The Member  must\r\n\r\nnot  be  taken in by the figures as such,  because\r\n\r\nnot every disabled person can be retrained. It may\r\n\r\nappear on paper that there is a big proportion  of\r\n\r\ndisabled people not making use of this scheme, but\r\n\r\nI am sure that quite a number of them are not in a\r\n\r\nposition   to  accept  this  kind  of  retraining.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we will see that our officials  do  make\r\n\r\nthis  training  scheme  known  to  those  who  are\r\n\r\nsuitable  for  training, and to  give  them  every\r\n\r\nencouragement wherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I thank the Minister of State\r\n\r\nfor  his  reply,  and  beg leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of Mr Ng Kah Ting, the following\r\n\r\namendments, standing in his name, were not\r\n\r\nproceeded with -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) That the total sum to be allocated for\r\n\r\nHead 0601 be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,904,800 for Head 0601 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0602 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0602 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1007.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment has been withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $219,330 for Head 0602 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a resolution of the House, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker thereupon left the Chair of the Committee\r\n\r\nand took the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir. 1 beg to\r\n\r\nreport  that  the  Committee of  Supply  has  made\r\n\r\nprogress on the Estimates of Expenditure  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1st April, 1972, to  31st  March,\r\n\r\n1973,  and ask leave to sit again on Monday,  20th\r\n\r\nMarch, 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Nine minutes past Seven o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
