I will provide\r\n\r\nfurther evidence to show that the reason why they do\r\n\r\nnot  want  a  referendum is that they  do  not  want\r\n\r\nmerger   between   Singapore  and  the   Federation,\r\n\r\nalthough they pay lip service to a merger policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd June, 1961, leaders of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nissued  a  statement announcing that they  advocated\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government for Singapore without  the\r\n\r\nInternal Security Council and agreed to Defence  and\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs  remaining  in  the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish.  This stand by the six Barisan leaders  was\r\n\r\nridiculed not only by us but also by the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson. Such a stand on the abolition of the Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Council will bring practically no change to\r\n\r\nSingapore's constitutional development. In fact,  it\r\n\r\nmeant  that the Barisan Sosialis was advocating  the\r\n\r\ncontinuation of --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T.

When this idea of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan leaders was laughed at and ridiculed by  the\r\n\r\npeople, the Barisan Sosialis quickly changed  their\r\n\r\nstand  and  thought  out a new  plan.  And  on  28th\r\n\r\nAugust,  1961,  they  issued a manifesto  which  was\r\n\r\nreferred to by the Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown, in a  debate  on  the  18th\r\n\r\nApril, 1962. I quote from the revised transcript  of\r\n\r\n18th April, 1962 [Vol. 17, No. 9, col. 888]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Lee Siew Choh: I bow to your ruling, Sir, and\r\n\r\nI  will  now,  therefore,  read  to  the  House  our\r\n\r\ndocument  as issued by the Barisan Sosialis  on  the\r\n\r\n28th August, 1961. That document is the stand of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  on our constitutional  future.  I\r\n\r\nwill skip the irrelevant parts and go on to the part\r\n\r\nwhich  follows the issue of Penang and  Malacca.  It\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The way ahead for real reunification of our\r\n\r\ncountry and our people is in one of two directions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an immediate, full and complete merger with\r\n\r\nSingapore   joining   the   Federation   as   a\r\n\r\nconstituent  state like Penang  or  Malacca -\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>those are the operative words -\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Let me repeat, \"those are the operative words\". Now,\r\n\r\nthe  stupidity of the Barisan Sosialis in advocating\r\n\r\nmerger  on the basis of Penang and Malacca  was,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  pointed out as early as 23rd November,  1961,\r\n\r\nwhen during a debate on merger it was the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson who said - let me quote Hansard. Vol 15, No.  7,\r\n\r\ncol. 574:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We will come to Penang and Malacca where the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, having no legal consultant, really\r\n\r\nslipped...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  I  suggest to you  that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  slipped  not because  they  had  no  legal\r\n\r\nconsultant. In fact, when the 13 Barisan Assemblymen\r\n\r\ndefected from the P.A.P., they also made great  play\r\n\r\nthat  they had their own legal advisers; one of them\r\n\r\nwas Mr T. T.

It is\r\n\r\nfantastic  indeed for a political Party  like  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  to  change its stand  as  easily  as  its\r\n\r\nleaders change their trousers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> How do you know\r\n\r\nthey change their trousers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They might not have changed\r\n\r\ntheir   trousers  perhaps,  but  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill could perhaps investigate by the smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when we pointed out to the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  that it was not possible for  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  merge  with the Federation on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nPenang  and  Malacca, they refused to acknowledge\r\n\r\nthe  mistake.  And finally it  was  left  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Hong Lim to point out publicly  this\r\n\r\nerror in the thinking of the Barisan Sosialis. At\r\n\r\nthe radio forum on 14th June, 1962, this was what\r\n\r\nthe Member for Hong Lim said - let me quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Just now the Prime Minister has mentioned about\r\n\r\nthe Barisan's stand of Penang and Malacca type of\r\n\r\nmerger.  My attitude towards this is that perhaps\r\n\r\nthey have once made a mistake.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Speaker, the Barisan has soiled its\r\n\r\npolitical trousers. We told them there was a stain\r\n\r\non their trousers but they would not believe it.\r\n\r\nThis was probably because we were sitting facing\r\n\r\nthem.  The Member for Anson and the Member for\r\n\r\nHong Lim, being seated behind the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, could see the  stain  on  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  trousers more clearly. And  they  finally\r\n\r\nconvinced  the  Barisan of their  mistake.  So  it\r\n\r\nwas that the Member for Hong Lim and the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  succeeded in persuading the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis to move a resolution for complete merger,\r\n\r\neven if it would mean the control of education\r\n\r\nand labour policies by the Central Government. In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Member for Anson, during the  debate\r\n\r\nlast  year  on  merger,  was  so  excited  at  the\r\n\r\nprospect  of  having  found  an  alliance  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and so delighted  that  he  had\r\n\r\nfound  a  new  formula that he had this  to  say\r\n\r\n(Hansard, Vol. 15, No. 7, col. 583):\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, I do not want to exaggerate. I cannot\r\n\r\nexaggerate.  But  I shall put it very  simply.  In\r\n\r\nfact,   Sir,  I  will  be  quite  frank  that   if\r\n\r\neducation   and   labour  were   given   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation,   the  White  Paper  would   be   more\r\n\r\nacceptable  to me, and I do not care if  it  means\r\n\r\nthe end of my political career.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Members of this House will remember the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson's public announcement   that   he   was   finished   with\r\n\r\npolitics after he had resigned as Chief Minister\r\n\r\nand failed to appear in a by-election in Cairnhill. We all know too well by now how much weight we can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattach  to the words of the Member for Anson.  The\r\n\r\nhistory of his political antics shows that  he  is\r\n\r\none  of the denizens of never, never land. Those\r\n\r\nwho  live  in never, never land never, never  mean\r\n\r\nwhat  they  say.  The Member for  Anson  was  so\r\n\r\ndelighted  that  he had found an alliance  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis - continued in Hansard, Vol. 15, No. 7, col. 566:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, I must say that I learned with some\r\n\r\nsurprise   and   delight  from  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown that his Party - to me, as far as  I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand, a Party that represents the industrial\r\n\r\nChinese   worker,  I  do  not   know   about   the\r\n\r\nothers - were prepared to accept Federation  control\r\n\r\nof education policy, and I say hear, hear!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  if the Barisan Sosialis, or for that matter\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim and the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nare   sincere  about  their  declarations,  then\r\n\r\nrightly they should go out and propagate to  the\r\n\r\npeople  that they wish for complete merger  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  even if  it  means  control  of\r\n\r\neducation  and  labour policies by  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But have they really done  that?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  they  have instead been  spending  their\r\n\r\ntime  in  denouncing the referendum and the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  proposals. What is astounding is  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis should, within the space of one\r\n\r\nyear,  have  changed  its stand  on  merger  three\r\n\r\ntimes.  Three  times! First, they wanted  internal\r\n\r\nself-government  without  the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil - the British to retain foreign affairs  and\r\n\r\ndefence. After this idea had been ridiculed by the\r\n\r\npeople,  they  advocated merger like  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca.  When  this new line was pointed  out  to\r\n\r\nthem  as  a mistake by the Member for Anson  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim, they proposed in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  complete  merger, even if  it  meant  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of education and labour policies  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, can the people of Singapore allow a political Party like the Barisan Sosialis to\r\n\r\nbe  in charge of the destiny of their future when\r\n\r\nsuch  a  political Party has no  firm  stand,  no\r\n\r\nfixed    policies   and   has   no    idea    what\r\n\r\nconstitutional changes mean to the livelihood of\r\n\r\nthe  people:  a  Party like the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwhich  takes  directives,  from  outside,  which\r\n\r\ntakes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirectives  or  advice even from their  opponents,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim and the Member for Anson?\r\n\r\nEven  the erstwhile revolutionaries in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have lost confidence in their own  Party\r\n\r\nand  in  their  leadership. We know, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat   the   Secretary-General  of   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong,  dispatched   a\r\n\r\nmystery  letter  to  the  Prime  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation, and by hand too. What the contents  of\r\n\r\nthis  letter are, we do not know. I do not believe\r\n\r\nthat  any  of  the 13 Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen\r\n\r\nknows what is in this letter either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Or is\r\n\r\nthis  a  secret sell-out? All these antics of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis clearly show their immaturity  in\r\n\r\nthe  handling of public affairs. We dread to think\r\n\r\nof the consequences if the affairs of this country\r\n\r\nare   allowed  to:  be  managed  by  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. The Barisan Sosialis can feed the people\r\n\r\nwith  slogans. But the people will remain  hungry.\r\n\r\nWhat  the  people want is an assurance that  they\r\n\r\nwill  have  food to eat and water  to  drink.

In fact, he  had  moved  an\r\n\r\namendment, which reads: 'merger as a state  on  an\r\n\r\nequal  basis  with  the other eleven  states  with\r\n\r\nautomatic Federation citizenship for all Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens in accordance with the spirit of the Reid\r\n\r\nReport  and  the constitutional documents  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation, 1948 and 1957.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  is right when he  says  that  the\r\n\r\namendment was moved. Notice was given but  it  was\r\n\r\nnot moved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for\r\n\r\nthe  correction. The amendment was not moved,  but\r\n\r\nnotice  of  the  amendment was given  along  these\r\n\r\nlines. The Member for Anson goes back to 1948  and\r\n\r\n1957. But he forgets that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  living in 1962. The spirit of the Reid Report\r\n\r\nis  already  embodied in the Constitution  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya.  This  Constitution   was\r\n\r\ngazetted  on  11th December, 1957. In  so  far  as\r\n\r\nthose  clauses  relating to the admission  of  new\r\n\r\nterritories  and  the question of  citizenship  by\r\n\r\nincorporation  of territories are concerned,  this\r\n\r\nConstitution still holds good. Article  2  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Parliament by law may admit other States to the\r\n\r\nFederation.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And Article 22 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any new territory is admitted to the\r\n\r\nFederation  in pursuance of Article 2,  Parliament\r\n\r\nmay  by  law  determine what, persons  are  to  be\r\n\r\ncitizens  by reason of their connection with  that\r\n\r\nterritory  and the date or dates from, which  such\r\n\r\npersons are to be citizens.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  means,  in fact, that there is no question  of\r\n\r\nautomatic  citizenship as demanded by the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, the Member for Anson and the Member  for\r\n\r\nHong Lim. Indeed, the Member for Anson argued that\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  provision for  the  transfer  of\r\n\r\nautomatic    citizenship   in    the    Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution.   How   those  citizens   who   have\r\n\r\nconnection  with the territory that  has  joined\r\n\r\nthe  Federation after 1957 can become citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation can only be decided by an  Act  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Parliament. This means that finally\r\n\r\nit  is  the  Federation Government which  must  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  passing  this  Act.   Therefore,\r\n\r\ncitizenship proposals must be negotiated with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government.  To  claim  for  automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship is quite contrary to the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Constitution. To ask the people  to\r\n\r\nvote  for something for which no provision is made\r\n\r\nconstitutionally is indeed to deceive the  people.\r\n\r\nAfter  he had spent considerable time reading  the\r\n\r\nReport  of the Reid Commission and arguing in  its\r\n\r\nfavour, we were indeed astounded that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson announced, that he did not wish to move\r\n\r\nhis amendment. The frivolity with which the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  introduces motions and withdraws  them\r\n\r\nshows  his  utter disregard for other  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House. We therefore cannot regard him  as  a\r\n\r\nman to be considered seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Barisan Sosialis, the U.P.P. and the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party are honest in their intention for a\r\n\r\ncloser relationship with the Federation, then they\r\n\r\nought to adopt a more realistic attitude and  seek\r\n\r\nto  explain  to  the  people what  can  really  be\r\n\r\nachieved now instead of dangling objectives  which\r\n\r\nthey  know  very  well cannot be obtained  in  the\r\n\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday the Barisan Sosialis opposed the\r\n\r\namendment  of the Member for Cairnhill  to  add  a\r\n\r\nthird   alternative  in  the  proposals  for   the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  This  proposal  by  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  suggested that Singapore  should  enter\r\n\r\nMalaysia  on  no  less favourable terms  than  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories. Let me remind the House  that\r\n\r\nduring  the  debate on merger, one of  the  points\r\n\r\nwhich  the Barisan Sosialis harped upon  was  that\r\n\r\nwhereas the Federation was prepared to accept  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories as constituent States of  the\r\n\r\nFederation. Singapore was being treated on a  less\r\n\r\nfavourable level. In fact, in their argument  they\r\n\r\nsuggested, that Singapore should be treated at par\r\n\r\nwith  the  Borneo territories. It  was  surprising\r\n\r\nindeed   that  the  Member  for  Queenstown, the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Barisan Sosialis,  should  have\r\n\r\nopposed the entry of Singapore into Malaysia on no\r\n\r\nless favourable terms than the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\nThis   stand  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  can   be\r\n\r\nexplained in the light of our knowledge  of  their\r\n\r\nopposition towards the formation of Malaysia.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis do not want Malaysia. Neither  do\r\n\r\nthey  want Singapore to enter Malaysia. Why,  Sir?\r\n\r\nThe  reason  is  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  line of the P.K.I., the  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  of  Indonesia, which opposes  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nPlan.  During the debate on West Irian, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  let the cat out of the bag  why  the\r\n\r\nBarisan was against Malaysia. Mr Speaker. I could\r\n\r\nnot get hold of a copy of Hansard for this debate,\r\n\r\nand  I have to resort to newspaper reports of this\r\n\r\ndebate.  This was what the Straits Times  of  20th\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1962 (page 4) had to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He [Mr Bani] said Malaysia was an anti-Indonesia plan. Mr David Marshall asked if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Bani would explain what he meant when he said\r\n\r\nthat Malaysia was an anti-Indonesia plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Bani  continued: \"We have  been  accused  of\r\n\r\nbeing anti-Malaysia. Our attitude is quite simple.\r\n\r\nWe support the concept of Malaysia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that an original plan for Malaysia had\r\n\r\nincluded  Indonesia, but the plan of  Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman excluded Indonesia.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson cannot deny saying that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  was anti-Indonesia because  it  did  not\r\n\r\ninclude  Indonesia. In fact, during the debate  on\r\n\r\nMalaysia,   the   Member  for   Anson   vigorously\r\n\r\nprotested  against  this  stand  of  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  I quote from the Straits Times  of  the\r\n\r\n25th of January, 1962, page 12:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Referring to a statement made by Mr S. T.

Our points\r\n\r\nof  view have been explained clearly and they  are\r\n\r\nin black and white in the records of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to repeat them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nmade a mistake in asking for complete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He thinks of getting complete\r\n\r\nmerger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Government Members, to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate their allegation, have attempted  to\r\n\r\nquote  the Member for Hong Lim as though he is  an\r\n\r\nauthority  on Barisan affairs, as saying  that  we\r\n\r\nhad made a mistake --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Certainly, the Barisan ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I ask the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister not to interject so often?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> To some extent, Sir, they\r\n\r\nhave  also  tried to quote the Member  for  Anson.\r\n\r\nBut,  as  you  are  aware, Mr Speaker.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  has refuted  this.  Today  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. use half truths and untruths to keep  this\r\n\r\nafloat.  The  Member for Hong  Lim  once  used  an\r\n\r\nanalogy of the Johore type of merger.\r\n\r\nSir, the P.A.P. has twisted that to mean\r\n\r\nthat he wants the Johore type of merger. Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot  want to suggest that the Menther for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nhas  made  a mistake. In all fairness to  him,  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  he  merely  made  the  analogy  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of a speech that he was making.  But  the\r\n\r\ndesperate  P.A.P. have tried to use that  to  make\r\n\r\npolitical  capital.  The  Member  for  Hong   Lim\r\n\r\nunwittingly played into the P.A.P. hands. Sir,  we\r\n\r\nmust  correct this and straighten it out once  and\r\n\r\nfor  all. There is no question of a mistake by the\r\n\r\nBarisan.  Sir,  we have stated in  the  past  very\r\n\r\nclearly  that we want merger. We have stated  that\r\n\r\nwe  want  complete merger. We have stated that  we\r\n\r\nwant a merger which is genuine and which can bring\r\n\r\nabout  genuine national unity. We have also stated\r\n\r\nthat, in our view, merger arrangements which  will\r\n\r\ncreate different classes of citizens,  which will\r\n\r\nonly  further  the disunity among our  people  and\r\n\r\nwhich  will deny the people of Singapore a  common\r\n\r\npolitical life with their brothers and sisters in\r\n\r\nthe Federation, will not constitute genuine merger\r\n\r\nand  will not bring about genuine national  unity.\r\n\r\nThere is no mistake about this, Mr Speaker.  The\r\n\r\nrecords show clearly our stand. Because today the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  politically bankrupt, they  seek  to\r\n\r\ndistort and use half truths and untruths to defend\r\n\r\ntheir  actions which are detrimental to  national\r\n\r\nunity. Therefore, Sir, they have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsought  to use our analogy of Penang and Malacca,\r\n\r\nto use this completely out of context is order to\r\n\r\ndistort our stand, because they hope by doing this\r\n\r\nthey will show that our proposition will mean  the\r\n\r\ndisfranchisement  of half of our  citizens.  They\r\n\r\nseek  to discredit us by saying that we want  half\r\n\r\nof  our  citizens  to  lose  their  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights.  They have done this in the  same  way  as\r\n\r\nthey  attempted to distort the analogy  of  Johore\r\n\r\nwhich was used by the Member for Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no mistake as I have already\r\n\r\nstated.  We have clearly asked for genuine  merger\r\n\r\nwith all Singapore citizens automatically becoming\r\n\r\nFederal citizens on merger. Just now, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, while the Deputy Prime Minister was speaking,\r\n\r\nhe  sought to suggest that the call for  complete\r\n\r\ninternal self-government was inconsistent with the\r\n\r\nstand of the Barisan Sosialis on the merger issue.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not want to start the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nwhole question of reunification all over again. We\r\n\r\nhave dealt with this matter at great length in the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the question of merger in  this  House\r\n\r\nlast year. This cheap tactic of the P.A.P. to  try\r\n\r\nand distort is not going to help them one wee bit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they say that we are communal in our\r\n\r\napproach and yet they seek to harp on autonomy  in\r\n\r\nlabour  and education. They say that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nmade  a  mistake  by asking for complete  merger,\r\n\r\nbecause  in  a complete merger there  will  be  no\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  education and labour.  Sir,  in  all\r\n\r\nhonesty,  if  the Government Members would  admit,\r\n\r\nthey  would  say  that this  is  directed  at  the\r\n\r\nChinese  population in Singapore, and  they  have\r\n\r\nthe  cheek  to  stand up and say that  it  is  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis that is playing the Chinese line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I have no intention of re-opening the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the whole question of merger. We  have\r\n\r\ndebated  it at great length and our conscience  is\r\n\r\nclear  because we have no dirt to hide. As I  also\r\n\r\nsaid,  we are not the least perturbed at all these\r\n\r\ntwists   and   turns,  at  all  these   lies   and\r\n\r\ndistortions of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister said that what the\r\n\r\nGovernment  offer are realistic alternatives.  We\r\n\r\ndispute this, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir.  Our  people  should not be  compelled  to\r\n\r\nchoose  one of these alternatives simply  because\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. consider  them realistic.  What  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. consider  realistic is  not  necessarily\r\n\r\ngood  for  our  people. It is  not  interest  of\r\n\r\nnational reunification. When the P.A.P. say  that\r\n\r\nthese  alternatives are realistic, what they  do,\r\n\r\nin fact, mean is necessarily in the\r\n\r\nthat  these  are  terms which are acceptable  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of  the Federation  of  Malaya.\r\n\r\nSurely,  Sir, what the Federation is prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept is not necessarily good for the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore;  it is not necessarily  fair  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis refuse to\r\n\r\naccept  the  position where  merger  terms  for\r\n\r\nSingapore are dictated by a handful of people\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation of Malaya. The fate of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore should not be  made  to\r\n\r\ndepend  on  the charity of a few men  who  hold\r\n\r\npower\r\n\r\nin their hands in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger must mean genuine national\r\n\r\nreunification of Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya. It must mean the genuine national\r\n\r\nunity  of our people. This cannot be achieved\r\n\r\nif  the people of Singapore are going  to  be\r\n\r\ntreated as slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. say, \"Merger now or never.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I\r\n\r\nnever said that. \"Merger now\r\n\r\nor later.\" There will be merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> They say that if there is to be no\r\n\r\nmerger now there will be no merger forever. The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister obviously denies this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I never said that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He will have his opportunity of\r\n\r\nrefuting  what  I said. But there  has  been  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  in the past that either you  accept\r\n\r\nmerger on whatever the terms now or you will be\r\n\r\ndoomed  forever. Sir, this has been put to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition in this House. This has been  put\r\n\r\nto  the  people of Singapore in the  form  of\r\n\r\nthreats,  and the impression the P.A.P. seek\r\n\r\nto  create is this: if we do not have  merger\r\n\r\non  the terms they propose, then that would be\r\n\r\nthe end of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore. That, in short, simply means  that\r\n\r\neither you have merger now on the terms  that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government are  prepared  to\r\n\r\ngive,  or  you  do  not have  merger  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Nonsense!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> However, we do not subscribe ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It   either  takes   place   now\r\n\r\npeacefully by consent or it will take place  at\r\n\r\nsome  subsequent time with a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\ntrial  and  tribulation amidst general commotion\r\n\r\nfor everybody and unhappiness for the whole of\r\n\r\nMalaya, including Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, if the P.A.P.

But what I do want to say here at\r\n\r\nthis  moment  is briefly this. We consider  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are not in a position to  negotiate\r\n\r\nterms with the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> There is nothing to stop you from\r\n\r\nnegotiating with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, one cannot negotiate for terms\r\n\r\nif  one  does  not  have the moral  standing  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate for them. Sir, the Government of the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya is not naive. The  men  who\r\n\r\nhold  power  in the Federation of  Malaya  are\r\n\r\nfully  aware  of  the political  situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and they know to what extent  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. command  the support of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They know - although  they  may  not\r\n\r\nadmit  it - that today the P.A.P. are  not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  express  the feelings  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  They are morally not in a  position  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate   for  terms  for  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  Member for cairnhill  indicated\r\n\r\nthis  many times when he made fun of  the  so-called  autonomy in labour and education  which\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. say had been got  as a result  of\r\n\r\nhard bargaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear that today the White Paper\r\n\r\nterms are being given to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government and they have no other choice\r\n\r\nthan to accept these terms. Our call have  a\r\n\r\nconference  of all the Parties in  Singapore  so\r\n\r\nthat  a  common   stand could  be  put  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government on the terms was not  accepted\r\n\r\nby the P.A.P. And today the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister says that we can negotiate.  We\r\n\r\ntell  the  P.A.P., Sir, that if  they  seriously\r\n\r\nwant   us  to  negotiate  for  terms,  let  them\r\n\r\ndissolve  this Assembly, hold the elections  and\r\n\r\nwhichever   party  that  Comes  to  power   can\r\n\r\nnegotiate  for  terms. They would  then  have  a\r\n\r\nfresh  and  direct mandate from  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I was saying, if we have to wait for\r\n\r\nbetter  terms, in our view, that does  not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  we will never have merger. The Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  are bound to change their  views  if\r\n\r\nthey  do not want to accept our terms just  now.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is  well known that at one  time  they\r\n\r\nsaid, \"No merger under any circumstances.\"  But\r\n\r\nnow they are prepared to consider merger of some\r\n\r\nsort.  Sir, this is a sure indication that their\r\n\r\nviews  are  bound to change further. And  I  say\r\n\r\nthat this is historically inevitable. Of course,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. cannot wait. We understand why  they\r\n\r\nsay this. We have stated time and again that the\r\n\r\ninterest   the  P.A.P. have  in  these   merger\r\n\r\nproposals  is only to the extent that they  will\r\n\r\nsave  their political career. We have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nwhatsoever that the fate of the P.A.P. rests on\r\n\r\ntheir White Paper merger proposals, and that  is\r\n\r\nwhy  there  is this hate, that is why  there  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be this unfair referendum, and that is\r\n\r\nwhy the P.A.P. say that they cannot wait.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. keep on saying that it is\r\n\r\nimpossible to get Federal citizenship  for  all\r\n\r\nSingapore    citizens.   Sir,    the    Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution, particularly Article 22, makes  it\r\n\r\npossible   for  the  Federation  Government   to\r\n\r\ndetermine the terms for any territory on  merger\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation. That Article, as in  fact\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson has indicated earlier, has\r\n\r\nbeen inserted in the constitution primarily  for\r\n\r\nthe purposes of deciding on terms on merger of a\r\n\r\nnew territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of words have been uttered by the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  try  and  ridicule  our  call   for\r\n\r\nautomatic Federal citizenship. Sir, by automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  we  do  not mean  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  only to go to the Federation  and\r\n\r\nplay  golf  and  on Merger Day  every  Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizen  will  automatically become  a  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen. We have never suggested this. We  have\r\n\r\nnever suggested that we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  get automatic Federal citizenship if we do not\r\n\r\ntalk it over with the Federation of Malaya. We have\r\n\r\nsaid  that  this  is  a  matter  that  has  to   be\r\n\r\nnegotiated   and   we  say  again  that   automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship is something that has to be  negotiated\r\n\r\nwith the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What makes you think you can\r\n\r\nwrite it into the Constitution?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, this is yet another point on which\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have sought to bluff the people.

We say that again that this\r\n\r\nis  a matter that has to be negotiated. Sir, here\r\n\r\nit  is interesting to recount the P.A.P. lies  on\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   Once   they  said   that   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship   for  all  Singapore  citizens   was\r\n\r\nimpossible.   When  we  exposed   this   lie   by\r\n\r\nexplaining that under the Federal Constitution it\r\n\r\nwas  possible  for the Federation  Government  to\r\n\r\ngrant  Federal  citizenship to all our  citizens,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. changed their line. This  time  they\r\n\r\nsaid  it  was  reasonable. When we again  exposed\r\n\r\nthis,  they  again changed their line.  And  this\r\n\r\ntime they talked in terms of super merger. Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  sure we have never heard of this term  \"super\r\n\r\nmerger\" when the merger issue was debated in this\r\n\r\nHouse.  The  super merger talk  only  came  about\r\n\r\nafter  the debate on the Referendum Bill started.\r\n\r\nThey  said,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nwanted  more merger than the P.A.P. Sir, we  tell\r\n\r\nthem:  we do not want more merger or less merger.\r\n\r\nWhat  the  P.A.P. seek to do is to get  something\r\n\r\nvery much less than merger.

Sir, the White Paper  proposals  are\r\n\r\n\"no   merger\",   and  this   is   no   Communist\r\n\r\npropaganda.   This  is  what  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill has said over and over again.

The  White Paper  proposals  do  not\r\n\r\nconstitute  merger. And we say it is not  merger.\r\n\r\nBut when we say this is not a merger, they say we\r\n\r\nwant  to  frustrate merger. Why do they  not  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  S.P.A. also want to frustrate  merger,\r\n\r\nbecause   the   S.P.A. say   this   is   closer\r\n\r\nrelationship? The S.P.A. say this is no merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. want a referendum on the White\r\n\r\nPaper because they are committed to holding  one.\r\n\r\nWe  want  a fair referendum. This the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nnot  prepared  to  hold, because  they  know  the\r\n\r\npeople will reject the White Paper proposals in a\r\n\r\nfair  and  reasonable referendum. The  Government\r\n\r\noppose  the  amendment moved by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  which  would  have  meant  only   one\r\n\r\nquestion.  Now,  Sir,  we  move  this  amendment,\r\n\r\nknowing  full well that this is not going  to  be\r\n\r\njust  one  question  but alternatives.  And  this\r\n\r\namendment  will  put  our  stand  to  the  people\r\n\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only decent thing the Government can\r\n\r\ndo  is  to accept the amendment. The Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister says we do not have the support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople;  he says we are inconsistent; we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave   consistent  policies.  The  Deputy   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  even  suggested  that  we  made  a\r\n\r\nmistake  by asking for complete merger, and  that\r\n\r\nonly   their  proposals  for  merger   are   fair\r\n\r\nproposals and only those will be accepted by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Here,  Sir, there is an opportunity  for\r\n\r\nthem   to   accept   the   challenge - accept   the\r\n\r\namendment;  the stand of the Barisan Sosialis  as\r\n\r\nhas been debated in this House last year at quite\r\n\r\nsome  length. Then we will see what  the  outcome\r\n\r\nis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a referendum is to ascertain the views of\r\n\r\nour  people.  It is not to force  the  people  to\r\n\r\nsupport   the   White   Paper   proposals.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment's  obligation is to  put  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nproposals to the people. It is not for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto decide whether the proposal is good or bad. It\r\n\r\nis for the people to decide. If this amendment is\r\n\r\naccepted, Sir, and if this proposal is put to the\r\n\r\npeople, we will accept the verdict of the  people\r\n\r\nwhichever way it goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  has  done a  lot  of  somersaults\r\n\r\nbefore.

And that was why he presented  the\r\n\r\nthird  question. Now we have put  up  the  fourth\r\n\r\nquestion   which  embodies  the  stand   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  as  was  debated in  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly last year. Although the S.P.A. did  not\r\n\r\nsupport  our amendment then, I think, to be  fair\r\n\r\nto  himself as well as to everybody and  to  make\r\n\r\nsure he will not have to eat his own words again,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Cairnhill  should  support  our\r\n\r\namendment, because it will allow a chance to  the\r\n\r\npeople to have a real choice of all the forms  of\r\n\r\nmerger which the political Parties in this  House\r\n\r\nhave put forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you see the alternatives which are put\r\n\r\nbefore the House at the present moment, the first\r\n\r\ntwo  are from the P.A.P., the third is supposedly\r\n\r\nfrom the S.P.A. But, as I have already indicated,\r\n\r\nthey  all come from the same source and have  the\r\n\r\nsame  theme.  They are all tailored to  suit  the\r\n\r\nwhims and fancies of Federal politicians and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  since they are acceptable to the Federal\r\n\r\npoliticians, they are presented to the House. But\r\n\r\nlet us ask all our representatives in this House:\r\n\r\nlet them ask themselves solemnly whether they are\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the people of  Singapore,  or\r\n\r\nwhether   they   are   representatives   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Let  us  ask them:  when  they  were\r\n\r\nelected  to  this Assembly, whether  the  general\r\n\r\nelections  were  held  in  Kuala  Lumpur  or   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I remember, Sir, that the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nlast year during the merger debate suggested to us\r\n\r\nthat  we  could  ask  Mr Lim Kean  Siew  and  Mr\r\n\r\nSeenivasagam  of  the  Socialist  Front  and   the\r\n\r\nProgressive Party respectively to put a motion  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federal  Parliament  to  suggest   automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship   on  merger.  That   is   an   absurd\r\n\r\nsuggestion and that alone goes to prove  that  our\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of  automatic  citizenship   was   not\r\n\r\nunrealistic. Even the Tunku himself said so,  that\r\n\r\nit  was  possible. At that time he said  the  only\r\n\r\nthing was that he would not grant it. That is all.\r\n\r\nBut  it  was possible. That is the point which  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  stress, and what the Member for  Thomson\r\n\r\nhas already stressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only trouble with our Prime Minister and the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  that  they went to negotiate  on  bended\r\n\r\nknees and they never had the support of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore behind them. I do not want to repeat\r\n\r\nwhat the Member for Thomson has already said.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that  our stand on merger is  good  is  even\r\n\r\nadmitted  by  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education the other night. He  said,\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the Barisan Sosialis stand is very good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He does not understand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The only thing, he said, was\r\n\r\nthat   it   was   not  realistic.   Let   us   ask\r\n\r\nhim - realistic to whom? To himself or to the people\r\n\r\nof   Singapore?  Of  course,  Sir,  it  may  sound\r\n\r\nunrealistic to certain people, perhaps  to  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npoliticians, or perhaps to Federation  politicians\r\n\r\nat  the  present moment, or to the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwho  has to run to the Federation for succours  in\r\n\r\norder that he may get the hand-outs to keep him in\r\n\r\noffice.   But  to  us  in  Singapore,   Sir,   our\r\n\r\nsuggestion    for   automatic   citizenship    and\r\n\r\nproportional representation is very realistic.  To\r\n\r\nus  it means the only basis for merger. It is  the\r\n\r\nonly  fair and just basis for merger, because,  as\r\n\r\nyou  know, Sir, merger is not only a merger of two\r\n\r\nterritories  but also a merger of two peoples.  If\r\n\r\nyou want to have merger, then you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmust have the mutual consent of the peoples of the\r\n\r\ntwo territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions of merger must work towards\r\n\r\nmutual  interest and mutual benefit. That  is  the\r\n\r\nonly  way we can have a happy merger and  a  happy\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  If  you have one party having  all  the\r\n\r\nadvantages over the other, you are just laying the\r\n\r\nground for future trouble. That would not lead  to\r\n\r\nnational   unity.  It  would  lead   to   national\r\n\r\ndisunity, as we have stressed time and time again.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when we talk of merger - even if we  want\r\n\r\nto  talk  on  the  mode and manner of  merger - our\r\n\r\nchoices  must not be limited to what other  people\r\n\r\nwant to accept. The choices must be on what we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  want. I hope the Front  Bench  on  this\r\n\r\nside  of  the  House as well as  the  P.A.P. will\r\n\r\nrealise this. It is only when you really ascertain\r\n\r\nthe  views of the people in Singapore that you can\r\n\r\nsay  that  you have an honest referendum.  If  you\r\n\r\npose questions which are limited to the choices of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., then it is ascertaining the views  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and  not  of the  people.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself  has repeatedly  said  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  is  to  ascertain  the  views  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people of Singapore - the views  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, and not the views of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Let  him  remember  that.  In  any  honest\r\n\r\nreferendum,  the  people  should  be  allowed   an\r\n\r\nopportunity to express their wishes and choice  on\r\n\r\nthe  mode and manner - even if they insist  on  this\r\n\r\n\"mode  and  manner\". From our point  of  view,  we\r\n\r\nthink  that  our  stand on merger - complete  merger\r\n\r\nwith   automatic   citizenship  and   proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation - will  have  the  backing   of   the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people of Singapore. Therefore, if\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. want  to  put  up  a  semblance   of\r\n\r\nhonesty - they  are  not  honest;  everybody   knows\r\n\r\nit - but even if they want to put up a semblance  of\r\n\r\nhonesty - let them accept our amendment and put  up\r\n\r\nour  stand for the people to accept or reject. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson gave a very picturesque  analogy\r\n\r\nthe  other  day. He spoke about a girl wanting  to\r\n\r\nget  married to a man. If she wants to get married\r\n\r\nto  A, it does not mean that she must accept B, C,\r\n\r\nor  D who happens to come along. Surely she has  a\r\n\r\nright  to  wait until A comes along. Of course  on\r\n\r\nmerger, Sir, we can wait. The only trouble\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the Prime Minister is that he cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto  wait,  because merger to him is the  means  of\r\n\r\npolitical survival. Without merger he knows he  is\r\n\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> He is finished anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, I agree. He is finished\r\n\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to be a habit in\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber  for  supporters  of  a  speaker  to\r\n\r\ninterject.  I have never come across that  in  any\r\n\r\nother Parliament. We get interjections from across\r\n\r\nthe  Floor,  but  not  from Back-benches.  And  it\r\n\r\nhappens on both sides of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The whole trouble with our\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  is  that  he  wants  to  deliver\r\n\r\nSingapore  bound hand and foot to  the  Federation\r\n\r\nbecause - I do not know - maybe he hopes to be  a  Tun\r\n\r\nsometime, maybe he hopes to get a safe seat in the\r\n\r\nSenate; maybe he is thinking of becoming a  United\r\n\r\nNations representative, and somebody has said that\r\n\r\nhe  is  looking forward to being the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Malaysia. I do not know.  Anyone  of\r\n\r\nthese is a possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In fact, he is a Prime Minister!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But the main thing is this.\r\n\r\nIf  we  are to go in, we must go in on terms which\r\n\r\nare  fair and just to the people of Singapore, not\r\n\r\njust  to  the P.A.P. Let them remember this.  They\r\n\r\nalways give the excuse that the White Paper merger\r\n\r\nproposals were the best that they could get.  They\r\n\r\nsay  that those were the best possible terms  that\r\n\r\nthey  could  get.  The  Member  for  Thomson   has\r\n\r\nstressed  that  at  that  time  they  were  in  no\r\n\r\nposition  to  negotiate, and therefore  how  could\r\n\r\nthey  get better terms? On this particular aspect,\r\n\r\neven  the Secretary-General of the S.P.A. has,  on\r\n\r\nmany  occasions, publicly stated that the  present\r\n\r\nterms  are not the best possible terms. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill also says he could get better terms\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  on merger; let him deny  it  after\r\n\r\nthis.  Therefore,  those so-called  best  possible\r\n\r\nterms  are not the best possible terms. The Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson reminded us that at one time the Tunku\r\n\r\ndid  not want merger. Now they have come round  to\r\n\r\nwanting merger. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  for a fact that they want Singapore so  much\r\n\r\nthat if only we stand firm the terms will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  improved. It is not that we want to  get  into\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. It is the Federation  wanting  to\r\n\r\ntake  in  Singapore.  Let us  remember  that  very\r\n\r\ncarefully.  The mere fact that the P.A.P. had  to\r\n\r\nreveal  the terms of the merger proposals  bit  by\r\n\r\nbit showed that they were afraid that their merger\r\n\r\nproposals would not be acceptable to the  people..\r\n\r\nThey  already realised then that they had to  hide\r\n\r\ntheir   shameful  deal  from  the  eyes   of   the\r\n\r\npeople - always    talking    of    nationals    and\r\n\r\ncitizenship!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be permitted to refer to what the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  said? I refer, Sir, to the  Official\r\n\r\nReport of the 10th of July, at page 39, [Vol.  19,\r\n\r\nNo. 2, col. 195] the last paragraph. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, the truth of the matter is that Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  retain  all  the rights  that  they  now\r\n\r\npossess.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Quite right, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In addition, they acquire new rights as\r\n\r\nnationals of the new Federation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  are the new rights of the nationals? As  far\r\n\r\nas we know, Sir, they have the right to possess  a\r\n\r\npassport;  they  have  the right  to  being  equal\r\n\r\nbefore  the  courts. But these,  Sir,  are  rights\r\n\r\nwhich  we  possess  in Singapore  at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment. So what are those new special rights which\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance talked about? Any person\r\n\r\nin  a  democratic society is equal in a  court  of\r\n\r\nlaw. Why must they be nationals before they can be\r\n\r\nequal in a court of law? In Singapore, we have our\r\n\r\nSingapore  passports. Does it make any  difference\r\n\r\nwhether we get our passports from Kuala Lumpur  or\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore?  But  the  one  thing  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has not dared to say is this:\r\n\r\nby  becoming  nationals, Singapore  citizens  will\r\n\r\nhave  the  right  to  be called  up  for  military\r\n\r\nservice. Now this is an obligation and a duty  and\r\n\r\nalso  a  right in a way. But if you want a man  to\r\n\r\nfight  for a country, make sure that he  gets  all\r\n\r\nthe  rights and privileges of that country. Do not\r\n\r\ntreat him as a second-class citizen and ask him to\r\n\r\nfight for that country. This is a sell-out of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  They  talk of merger. Yet after merger,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen who becomes a Federal  national\r\n\r\nor  a  Malaysian  national  has  to  go  into  the\r\n\r\nFederation as an alien and will be treated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  an  alien  because he cannot  have  all  the\r\n\r\nrights  and  privileges of a Federal citizen.  How\r\n\r\ncan   you   call   this   \"merger\"   under   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances?  Let me go further  down  the  same\r\n\r\nparagraph. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A Singapore citizen now enjoys certain basic\r\n\r\npolitical  rights.  He has a right  of  franchise,\r\n\r\nthat is, he has a right to choose who shall govern\r\n\r\nSingapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  somewhere a few lines from the bottom of  the\r\n\r\npage, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He loses none of these rights after merger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I was very interested to read about the comparison\r\n\r\nof the pros and cons of the P.A.P. type of merger.\r\n\r\nHe  says,  \"He  loses none of these  rights  after\r\n\r\nmerger.\"  I challenge that statement.  Let  us  go\r\n\r\nback to the fifth line of the paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He has a right of franchise, that is, he has a\r\n\r\nright to choose who shall govern Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Very  right,  Sir - \"He has a right  to  choose  who\r\n\r\nshall  govern Singapore.\" But let us ask him  what\r\n\r\nsort  of Government will he choose? Will he choose\r\n\r\na  Government that has the powers that we have  at\r\n\r\nthe  present  moment? Is that not  something  that\r\n\r\nwill  be lost? At the present moment, Sir, however\r\n\r\nweak  we  may  be,  however  limited  our  powers,\r\n\r\nSingapore still has three-sevenths of the power in\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Council. But let us see what\r\n\r\nhappens  when  we go into the Central  Parliament.\r\n\r\nLet us see what happens when we have this humbug of  a  merger.  We  will get fifteen  seats  in  an\r\n\r\nenlarged   Parliament  of  say  150   seats.   The\r\n\r\nproportion of power that Singapore will  get  will\r\n\r\nbe  15  upon 150. What is that? That is one-tenth.\r\n\r\nFrom  three-sevenths of the power that we can  get\r\n\r\nin  our  own Government, we are going to get  only\r\n\r\none-tenth  of the power, is that not a  reduction?\r\n\r\nIs  that not something lost? I do not have to  say\r\n\r\nanything  about  the 25 per cent  of  the  revenue\r\n\r\nwhich   Singapore  will  lose   to   the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment. At the present moment, Sir, we control\r\n\r\nevery  cent  of our own money in Singapore.  After\r\n\r\nthis  humbug  of  a merger, 25  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nrevenue from Singapore will be controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government in Kuala Lumpur. Is that not  a\r\n\r\nloss?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whenever we say \"second-class citizen\", they\r\n\r\nsay  it  is  not  true. They say that  some  legal\r\n\r\nopinion  has  been given saying that there  is  no\r\n\r\nsuch thing as a second-class citizen. Second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  Sir, is something  which  you  feel,\r\n\r\nsomething which you know --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Old tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I realise that the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation does not like to hear it because he  has\r\n\r\nalready sold out the rights of Singapore. We  have\r\n\r\nalready told him repeatedly, but he does not  like\r\n\r\nto  hear  it I ask him to go out into the  streets\r\n\r\nand  coffee-shops. Everybody will be able to  tell\r\n\r\nhim   something  which  he  does  not   understand\r\n\r\nhimself, that by encouraging this type of  merger,\r\n\r\nthey  are  going to turn Singapore  citizens  into\r\n\r\nsecond-class citizens. They asked, \"How  can  this\r\n\r\nbe  so?\"  I have already indicated a little  while\r\n\r\nback that our powers in our own Government will be\r\n\r\nreduced. The citizens will not be able to elect  a\r\n\r\nGovernment that will have full powers to deal with\r\n\r\nour  own affairs in Singapore. As regards internal\r\n\r\nsecurity,  at  the present moment, we  still  have\r\n\r\nthree-sevenths of the power, whereas  once  we  go\r\n\r\ninto the Central Parliament we get only one-tenth.\r\n\r\nMoney? - one-quarter  gone.  But  what   is   more\r\n\r\nimportant,  Sir - anybody will be  able  to  see  it\r\n\r\nstraightaway - is   that  at  the  present   moment,\r\n\r\nSingapore    will   be   sending   only    fifteen\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to the Central Parliament. We have\r\n\r\n624,000 citizens in Singapore. Let us do a  little\r\n\r\nbit  of arithmetic, Sir. Divide 624,000 by 15, and\r\n\r\nyou  will  find that it works out to somewhere  in\r\n\r\nthe  region  of 41,000 citizens. In  other  words,\r\n\r\n41,000  Singapore citizens will  be  electing  one\r\n\r\nrepresentative to the Central Parliament.  Let  us\r\n\r\nlook at the Central Parliament in Kuala Lumpur. At\r\n\r\nthe present moment, they have 104 seats, and their\r\n\r\ntotal electorate is somewhere in the region of 2.3\r\n\r\nmillion. I am not sure of the figure, Sir, but  it\r\n\r\nis  approximately that. If you do a little bit  of\r\n\r\narithmetic and divide this 2.3 million citizens by\r\n\r\n104,  you   will  find that you get  a  figure  of\r\n\r\n21,000  or 22,000. In other words, 22,000 citizens\r\n\r\nin the Federation will be able to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelect    one   representative   to   the   Central\r\n\r\nParliament.  In  the  case  of  Singapore,  41,000\r\n\r\ncitizens can elect only one representative to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Parliament. Any three-year old child  will\r\n\r\nbe able to tell our Government Ministers that that\r\n\r\nmeans  our  citizenship value is nearly  half  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  value of the Federation citizens.  If\r\n\r\nyou  add  on the rural weight-age, you  will  find\r\n\r\nthat  in  many  cases the value of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship is only a quarter of the value of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  citizenship in certain  areas  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  So  this second-class citizenship  is\r\n\r\nclear. It is easily demonstrated and anybody  with\r\n\r\na  little  bit  of  feeling and a  little  bit  of\r\n\r\nintelligence will be able to see straightaway --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Have you any?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But it looks as if such\r\n\r\nintelligence  is not to be found in  our  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer again to the same transcript, page\r\n\r\n43  [Vol.  19,  No. 2, cols. 201-2],  also  in  a\r\n\r\nspeech  by the Minister for Finance. It is in  the\r\n\r\nthird  paragraph.  He  was asking  how  would  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  be  better  off  if   we   had\r\n\r\nautomatic  conversion, and he said he  could  only\r\n\r\nsee advantages in two respects:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First, he will be able to stand for election in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  general  election,  not  only  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but  also in the Federation.  This  is\r\n\r\nsomething  not  of  great  value  to  the  average\r\n\r\ncitizen who, if he wants to stand for election  to\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Parliament, can do so in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  other additional benefit the average  citizen\r\n\r\ngets  from automatic conversion is that he  will\r\n\r\nbe able to vote more easily in the Federation when\r\n\r\nhe changes his address and moves there.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he says these advantages are not of\r\n\r\nfundamental  importance. You  see,  Sir,  how  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance in his prepared speech talked\r\n\r\nabout    this   citizenship   right   being    not\r\n\r\nfundamental.  He  thinks it is  of  no  importance\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.  He  belittles the  basic  fundamental\r\n\r\nright in any parliamentary democracy. If we are to\r\n\r\nrely on the one man one vote system, the only  way\r\n\r\nto  make sure that you have your voice heard is to\r\n\r\nsee  that you have the voting right. If you do not\r\n\r\nhave  the  voting right, your voice is not  heard,\r\n\r\nand   you  will  not  be  able  to  influence  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or pressure the Government to make  any\r\n\r\nnew change you consider necessary. And here you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee,  Sir,  the Minister for Finance  saying  that\r\n\r\nthese  are  not  important things. These  are  the\r\n\r\nbasic  and fundamental things. If you have merger,\r\n\r\nSir, it is a case of merger of the peoples and  of\r\n\r\nall  the  peoples  coming together  and  having  a\r\n\r\ncommon  political life. The citizens of  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  have the right to go to the Federation  to\r\n\r\ninfluence the Federation citizens, and vice versa,\r\n\r\nso  that  the Central Parliament will be  able  to\r\n\r\npursue  a policy which will be acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\npeoples of both the territories. It is only  then,\r\n\r\nSir,  that you can change the Government or change\r\n\r\nthe Ministers who do not happen to agree with your\r\n\r\nviews  at  periodic intervals. There is  no  other\r\n\r\nway,  Sir,  and yet our Minister for Finance  says\r\n\r\nthis  is  unimportant. I know,  for  example,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance stays in Cairnhill.  At  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment, he is the Member for Kreta  Ayer.\r\n\r\nThat  is  very far away, Sir, If he subscribes  to\r\n\r\nthis  policy of his, it amounts to this,  that  by\r\n\r\nstaying in Cairnhill he will not be able to go  to\r\n\r\nKreta  Ayer to stand for election, and if he wants\r\n\r\nto go to Kreta Ayer to stand for election, then he\r\n\r\nwill  have to go to Kreta Ayer and stay there  for\r\n\r\n10  years. Or our Deputy Prime Minister, who stays\r\n\r\nin  Tanglin, will not be able to go to Rochore  to\r\n\r\nstand for election --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> But I have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is the whole trouble.

I  want to refer to paragraph  2  [col.\r\n\r\n196],  Sir.  The Minister for Finance was  talking\r\n\r\nabout   equality  before  the  law,   freedom   of\r\n\r\nmovement,  freedom of speech, and  all  that,  and\r\n\r\nthen in the second paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"`Except as expressly authorised by this\r\n\r\nConstitution,  there  shall be  no  discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst citizens on the ground only of religion.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to stress, Sir, on the words, \"Except as\r\n\r\nexpressly   authorised  by   this   Constitution\".\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, what we have at the present moment\r\n\r\ncan easily be changed if the Central Parliament by\r\n\r\na motion change the constitution. As you may know,\r\n\r\nSir, not so very long ago, they had amendments  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federal  Constitution.  In  fact,  they  have\r\n\r\nalready   had   three  changes  in   the   Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution in the short period of a  few  years.\r\n\r\nSo what guarantee do we have that there will be no\r\n\r\nmore changes again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Go and join the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is the point, Sir.

They have  all  the  time\r\n\r\nchided us to reveal the contents of, our letter to\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku.  We  had  not, wanted  to  reveal  the\r\n\r\nletter,  Sir, not just to please them. No,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot our intention to make political capital out of\r\n\r\nthe letter which we sent to the Tunku. But  very\r\n\r\nunfortunately for the Ministers opposite, they did\r\n\r\nnot know the actual contents, and because they did\r\n\r\nnot know, they sought deliberately to misinterpret\r\n\r\nand  distort the contents of our letter  that,  we\r\n\r\nsent to the Tunku. By so doing, they had hoped  to\r\n\r\nconvince their own Backbenches that our  letter\r\n\r\nto  the  Tunku  was  to ask for special  terms  on\r\n\r\nmerger, and because we had refused to divulge what\r\n\r\nis  in  that letter, therefore, that letter  meant\r\n\r\nthat the Tunku had refused us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Sir, that every time they talked\r\n\r\nabout  our  letter, they linked  it  up  with  the\r\n\r\nletter  which  the Member for Anson wrote  to  the\r\n\r\nTunku,  and by so doing they had hoped  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  confuse their own supporters who - I  believe\r\n\r\nthere are some who are maybe dissatisfied with the\r\n\r\nways  of their leaders. As I say, Sir, it  is  not\r\n\r\nour intention to make political capital out of our\r\n\r\nexchange of letters, unlike the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers  of the P.A.P. who  will  stoop  to\r\n\r\nalmost  anything. May I at this  stage,  Sir,  say\r\n\r\nthat  when  our  Secretary-General  wrote  to  the\r\n\r\nTunku,  he  wrote  with the full approval  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Executive Committee. It is a  pity  their\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch did not know about  this.  Because\r\n\r\nour  telephones are, all tapped and their  Special\r\n\r\nBranch spies follow us around all the time.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  they must turn to MI5 now, if their  Special\r\n\r\nBranch  does not prove to be good enough.  Anyway,\r\n\r\nwhatever  we  do  in the Barisan  Sosialis  we  do\r\n\r\ncollectively, unlike some of the P.A.P.  Ministers\r\n\r\nwho,  as  far as I remember, used to make speeches\r\n\r\nand  those  speeches then became policies  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  That was a bit too  much  for  us  to\r\n\r\nstomach  at  that  time and  because  of  that  we\r\n\r\nultimately had to leave the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say, Sir, since the P.A.P. have been trying\r\n\r\nto make political capital out of our letter to the\r\n\r\nTunku and since they have been trying to confuse\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmislead the people, I think it is appropriate  that\r\n\r\nwe now expose their lies and  innuendoes concerning\r\n\r\nour  letter  which  had at  one  time  caused  a\r\n\r\nsensation in the local Press. The P.A.P. at  first\r\n\r\nfabricated   the  falsehood  about  our  Secretary-General having gone to hand a letter personally  to\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku,  until  we exposed  the  falsehood.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  after  we had exposed the falsehood,  they\r\n\r\nchanged  their  line and now say  that  it  is  our\r\n\r\nAssistant Secretary-General. That is quite true  as\r\n\r\nwe  pointed out at that time. Sir, since there  has\r\n\r\nbeen so much talk about our letter, let me read out\r\n\r\nthe  contents  of the letter which  our  Secretary-General wrote to the Tunku. Before doing that,  may\r\n\r\nI quote the Official Transcript of the 9th of July,\r\n\r\n1962,  at  page 27 [Vol. 19, No. 1, col.  39];  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  was talking about the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson having tried to write to the Tunku, and  then\r\n\r\nhe added:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And even the Communist-controlled Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,   through  their  open  front  Secretary-General,  Mr  Lim Ching Siong,  in  April,  a  few\r\n\r\nmonths ago, sent a letter to Tunku Abdul Rahman  by\r\n\r\nthe  personal  hand  of  the  Assistant  Secretary-General.  What  the letter contains  presumably  is\r\n\r\nonly  known to the Secretary-General and the Tunku.\r\n\r\nBut everybody can guess what this gesture of peace-making  was aimed at. However, the very  fact  that\r\n\r\nneither the letter nor the response of the Tunku to\r\n\r\nthe letter has ever been made public ---'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh Chin Chye: Even to the Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime  Minister: ---  probably  even   to  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Party, is in itself significant.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you, Sir, this letter is somewhere in\r\n\r\nthe  middle of my April-May file.

There is no  White\r\n\r\nPaper  on it and, in effect, the people are  asked\r\n\r\nto  choose  something which is not only vague  but\r\n\r\nalso  something  which they know  hardly  anything\r\n\r\nabout.  It  amounts to giving the P.A.P. a  blank\r\n\r\ncheque.  Who  wants  to give the  P.A.P. a  blank\r\n\r\ncheque?  As  it is, the P.A.P. are  untrustworthy\r\n\r\nenough  and  nobody  has any confidence  in  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is very difficult for the  voter  to\r\n\r\ndecide on it and to vote for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the third alternative, Sir, I have already\r\n\r\nindicated that it is another unknown quantity, and\r\n\r\nit is not a genuine choice which is being posed to\r\n\r\nthe people. Now, what we want is a genuine choice.\r\n\r\nYou  must give a choice which is acceptable to the\r\n\r\npeople - something which they can choose. The fact\r\n\r\nthat the voter is not allowed to say \"No\" is proof\r\n\r\nenough, Sir, that the P.A.P. know that the choices\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  offering to the  people  are  not\r\n\r\nacceptable  to  the  vast majority.  There  is  no\r\n\r\njustification whatsoever for them to say that  the\r\n\r\npeople cannot say \"No\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we ask that we in Singapore be allowed to\r\n\r\nhave  a  genuine and honest choice of the type  of\r\n\r\nmerger that the people want. As has been suggested\r\n\r\nby the Member for Cairnhill, let all the Parties\r\n\r\ngo  and  explain  to the people  their  respective\r\n\r\nstands  on merger, on the questions which will  be\r\n\r\nposed  in the referendum. Let the Government admit\r\n\r\nthat we have a right to ask another question to be\r\n\r\nproposed to the people. It is our duty to convince\r\n\r\nthe  people as to the most suitable form of merger\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore. It is simple, it is fair,  and  at\r\n\r\nleast,  under  the circumstances since  they  have\r\n\r\ninsisted  on the mode and manner - there  will  be\r\n\r\nless complaints. At the present moment, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  the  Radio, Rediffusion, and the  Press  all\r\n\r\nunder  their  control. I do not  think  they  need\r\n\r\nworry  as to what the Opposition Parties will  do.\r\n\r\nThey do not have to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworry  about  the Opposition Parties  telling  the\r\n\r\npeople  what they are supposed to know.  What  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties  can do,  I  should  say,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  with all the facilities at their command,\r\n\r\nshould be able to do much better. Therefore,  they\r\n\r\nneed  have no fear of allowing a fourth choice  to\r\n\r\nbe  offered  to  the people. Let them  accept  our\r\n\r\namendment  to put a fourth alternative.  Let  them\r\n\r\nnot  try  to railroad merger with this  humbug  of\r\n\r\ntheir three choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our stand is well known. It has been\r\n\r\ndebated in this Assembly and the people, in  spite\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. distortion, know that we stand  for\r\n\r\nautomatic    conversion   and   for   proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation. I want to remind the  S.P.A. once\r\n\r\nagain  of their statement that they want a genuine\r\n\r\nchoice to be posed to the people. Now is the  time\r\n\r\nfor  the S.P.A. to support our amendment. Let  all\r\n\r\nthe possible alternatives acceptable to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore be posed to them for their choosing.\r\n\r\nThen  let  the people decide. Only then  will  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"referendum\" as given by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  that it is a process to  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nviews  of the majority of the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nhold  true.

If they insist on going  on,\r\n\r\nthey  will have no way out. The provisions in  the\r\n\r\nNational Referendum Bill have been debated in this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  the Bill has been passed.

I want to quote some speeches  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister as recorded in the Sin Chew Jit Poh\r\n\r\nof  the  8th  of  July.  It was  reported  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper  that  at  a Press conference  broadcast\r\n\r\nover  Radio  Singapore,  when  the  Tunku  was  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  The Prime Minister of Singapore was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nasked, if he had his way, whether he would have  a\r\n\r\nnational  referendum.

For the  sake  of  the\r\n\r\nofficial  record of this House and not to misquote\r\n\r\nhim,  I  would  like to read all  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said. He is reported to have said, \"I have\r\n\r\nsaid in the past what I thought about this. Let me\r\n\r\nrepeat  it.  In the Legislative Assembly  we  have\r\n\r\nsecured  enough power and rights.

The term \"genuine  merger\"\r\n\r\nis not in the vocabulary of any historian. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to say, as a humble student of history, when\r\n\r\nwe   talk   about   forms  of   closer   political\r\n\r\nassociation, we do not talk about genuine  forms\r\n\r\nor phoney forms --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Barisan Sosialis forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> There are certain main types\r\n\r\nof  forms which have existed historically. We  are\r\n\r\ntold  by historians that certain types fit certain\r\n\r\nsituations.  The  form that the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nproposes and discusses as merger, which really  is\r\n\r\njust   a  form  of  merger,  or  closer  political\r\n\r\nassociation,  envisages  that  all  citizens  will\r\n\r\nautomatically  become Federal citizens  on  Merger\r\n\r\nDay.  If it were in our power to say so, we  would\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Yes, we agree.\" But it is not in our power.\r\n\r\nIt is like a man buying some goods. What I wish to\r\n\r\npay  may  not  be  acceptable  to  the  seller.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore cannot insist that the seller must  sell\r\n\r\nat  my  price.  If we insist, Sir,  that  is  not\r\n\r\nshowing   a   spirit   of   true   socialism   and\r\n\r\nbrotherhood, but of imperialism, of demand, and I\r\n\r\nthink,  between Malays and Chinese,  and  Indians,\r\n\r\nthere  must not be a spirit of demand. There  must\r\n\r\nbe  a  spirit of goodwill and brotherhood.  As  we\r\n\r\nlearn to trust one another, we will find that more\r\n\r\nwill  be given without that demand being made.  As\r\n\r\nwe  become  Malaysian-minded, then all these  four\r\n\r\ndistinctions will disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the fourth door is closed and bolted, are\r\n\r\nwe  therefore  to say to the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\n\"Do  not enter through any of the other doors?\"  I \r\n\r\nthink  that is being negative. Can we say  to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, \"Be satisfied with your state\r\n\r\nof increasing unemployment. Wait until the door is\r\n\r\nunbolted.  Never mind if there are more  and  more\r\n\r\nthousands  of young people unemployed. Never  mind\r\n\r\nif  wages cannot rise.

Very  likely  if  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  had been with the P.A.P. at  this  time,\r\n\r\nthey  would have said all the three doors are good\r\n\r\nmust  say  that  even in our own  Party  sometimes\r\n\r\nthere are people like that. I think in every Party\r\n\r\nthere are people who put party politics first. But\r\n\r\nwe  believe,  Sir,  that in the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry we must have more and more people who will\r\n\r\nsay we put the national interest first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Even if it means accepting\r\n\r\nfrom our political foe something which is good, we\r\n\r\nwill  accept  it  provided  it  is  good  for  the\r\n\r\ncountry. With that attitude and in that spirit,  I\r\n\r\nthink we all agree that for Singapore there cannot\r\n\r\nbe  a  \"no\"  to  the  entry of  Singapore  into\r\n\r\nMalaysia. For the sake of the people, it  must  be\r\n\r\n\"yes\".  The only decision we have to make  is  the\r\n\r\nmode  and manner of entry. If three doors are open\r\n\r\nand  one  door  is closed, well, we must  ask  the\r\n\r\npeople to decide which of the three doors they can\r\n\r\nenter. We cannot insist and say, \"The people  must\r\n\r\nnot be allowed to choose,\" because the fourth door\r\n\r\nthat  we want is closed and it is not in our hands\r\n\r\nto open the bolt. If the Barisan Sosialis say they\r\n\r\ncan  open  the bolt, we are happy.

I  ask  him  to  notice  that  they  are\r\n\r\noffering  us a so-called proposal of complete  and\r\n\r\nunconditional merger. That is proposal (b). I take\r\n\r\nit  the  Member for Tanglin, having  accepted  it,\r\n\r\nsays  that that door is open. Maybe it was a  long\r\n\r\ntime  ago, and memory is short in this House,  but\r\n\r\nit was referred to last November and I refer to it\r\n\r\nagain today. These are the words of the Federation\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister spoken on 16th October,  1961.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin will bear with me, I  will\r\n\r\nquote  it from page 9 of the Straits Times of  the\r\n\r\nnext day:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One thing is certain, and that is we cannot take\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  us in complete merger  without  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of unhappiness and trouble, and so  we\r\n\r\nmust find a middle course.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, talking about the Federation bolting\r\n\r\nthe door, if he says they have bolted the door  to\r\n\r\nour  proposal, what about proposal (b)?  Here  are\r\n\r\nthe words used by the Federation Prime Minister:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot take Singapore with us in a complete\r\n\r\nmerger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Yet  they pretend that that door is open, and  our\r\n\r\nbeloved  Prime Minister, illustrious and  learned,\r\n\r\non  the  12th  of June in a radio broadcast  which\r\n\r\nwent over Radio P.A.P. on the 14th said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the people reject the White Paper proposals,\r\n\r\nthey  just  vote for complete merger.  That  is  a\r\n\r\nrejection of the White Paper proposals and we will\r\n\r\nget them complete merger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where is the logic of this? The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the Federation on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16th of October in his own Parliament told his\r\n\r\npeople and their representative:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot take Singapore with us in complete\r\n\r\nmerger.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister told us on the 12th of June,\r\n\r\n\"You  want  complete merger? We  will  get  it  for\r\n\r\nyou.\"  And he puts it in proposal (b). We have  now\r\n\r\nlearned  that  it  is almost physically  impossible\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P. to be honest. Everything they do  is\r\n\r\ndone   with   a  corkscrew  and  so  we  anticipate\r\n\r\ndishonesty from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I ask the Member for Tanglin, whose profession\r\n\r\nhas taught him logic and whose repute for integrity\r\n\r\nhas never been challenged, political novice though\r\n\r\nhe may be, I ask how he squares the suggestion that\r\n\r\nproposal (b) is open but our proposal is not?\r\n\r\nProposal (b) is an open door, but the proposal we\r\n\r\nurge is not an open door. How does he make that\r\n\r\ndistinction, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment before you is a matter that has\r\n\r\ncoalesced  and codified the stand of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nfrom the very commencement. It was the one that  was\r\n\r\ndebated  at  length  and  was  finally  defeated  on\r\n\r\nDecember  the  6th,  with  the  Member  for  Tanglin\r\n\r\nsupporting.  At that time, there was no question  of\r\n\r\n\"We  would  like to get it for you,  but  it  was  a\r\n\r\nclosed door.\" There were other excuses. He says, and\r\n\r\nnot wrongly, if you ask for something but the seller\r\n\r\nwill  not  sell it at that price? I agree with  him,\r\n\r\nand  the  answer is patience. If you cannot  get  it\r\n\r\ntoday, you may get it next week. You may get it next\r\n\r\nmonth. It is a matter of patience. If you cannot get\r\n\r\nwhat  you  want  today, does it  mean  you  have  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  the  opportunity for what you really  seek?\r\n\r\nSir,  there is a little couplet that says, \"For sake\r\n\r\nof  silver spent today, why pledge tomorrow's gold?\"\r\n\r\nSingapore and the people of Singapore have waited  a\r\n\r\nvery long time for freedom and for integration,  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  shown an immense capacity for  patience.\r\n\r\nWhy,  I ask the Member for Tanglin, does he consider\r\n\r\nthat  a year or two is so vital that we must destroy\r\n\r\nthe  reality in chasing the shadow? The  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin knows full well that in the context  of  our\r\n\r\npeople, citizenship is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsheet-anchor  of their security. If we  cannot  give\r\n\r\nthem  that common citizenship, they will not have  a\r\n\r\nsense of security or belonging which alone can  make\r\n\r\npossible a happy and united nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very unhappy to note, Sir, that the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nhas  seen  fit to start on an inauspicious  note  in\r\n\r\nrejecting  a proposal which at least 17  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House urged and went on record in support of  on\r\n\r\nthe 6th of December. Whether it is closed or whether\r\n\r\nit  is  open,  is  the Member for Tanglin  seriously\r\n\r\ntelling  me  that  he  knows for  certain  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government would be prepared  to  accept\r\n\r\nproposal (c) which they have introduced through  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill, \"on terms no less favourable\r\n\r\nthan  any of the Borneo territories\"? Does he really\r\n\r\nsay that that door is open? If so, we would like  to\r\n\r\nknow why. Has it ever been negotiated? He knows  the\r\n\r\nanswer  truthfully - No. Has (b) ever been negotiated?\r\n\r\nNo,  Sir, It has not been negotiated. Nor  has  (b)\r\n\r\nbeen  negotiated. I say that if he wants, and  I  am\r\n\r\nnot suggesting, as has the Member from Cairnhill, to\r\n\r\nput  all  possible alternatives before  the  people,\r\n\r\nwell,  let  us at least put this one which  has  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of one-third of the total number of Members\r\n\r\nin this House. It will not exhaust all possibilities\r\n\r\nof  merger, but it is a fair and an honest one.  And\r\n\r\nif  the P.A.P., with their corkscrew mentality, seek\r\n\r\nto  suggest that it is dishonest, because  according\r\n\r\nto  the Prime Minister you are offering a dish  that\r\n\r\nis  not  on  the menu, let me rub it in again,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey are offering proposal (b) allegedly because the\r\n\r\nOpposition  wants  it  and  in  the  terms   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation Prime Minister - I repeat it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One thing is certain, and that is we cannot take\r\n\r\nSingapore with us in complete merger without a great\r\n\r\ndeal of unhappiness and trouble, and so we must find\r\n\r\na middle course.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if this is a fraud, what about his proposal\r\n\r\n(b)? Is it a fraud, that we all know it is, the\r\n\r\nallegedly honest alternative?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the amendment before you is in the spirit of the Reid Report, and if you will remember\r\n\r\nI read the paragraph which spoke of those having\r\n\r\ncitizenship retaining those rights in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na   common   citizenship.  That  is  one   of   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional documents. On Monday, Sir,  at  page\r\n\r\n21  [Vol.  19, No. 1, col. 31], the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nasked if we could show him any precedent or analogy\r\n\r\nfor automatic citizenship:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, if the constitutional documents contain\r\n\r\neither,  by precedent or by analogy, provisions  to\r\n\r\nsupport such a claim...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you got that Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On page 21?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is about a quarter from the\r\n\r\nbottom,  \"Sir,  if  the constitutional  documents.\"\r\n\r\nNow,  Sir,  I  say by analogy and by precedent,  we\r\n\r\nhave the Reid Commission Report and we have Article\r\n\r\n28  of  the  Constitution  giving  State  nationals\r\n\r\nimmediate citizenship on entry into the Federation.\r\n\r\nThe  Deputy  Prime Minister says that there  is  no\r\n\r\npossibility  under  the Constitution  of  automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  Again,  Mr  Speaker,  he  seeks   to\r\n\r\nflounder in technicalities. Under Article  22,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   the   Federation   Parliament   can   in\r\n\r\nanticipation  pass  an Act to  say  that  from  the\r\n\r\nmoment  the  instruments of transfer of sovereignty\r\n\r\nover  Singapore  are  executed and  exchanged,  all\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore shall be  citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  That  would be automatic.  The  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  is  wrong in  saying  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible to provide for automatic citizenship. In\r\n\r\nfact, Article 22 requires the Federation Parliament\r\n\r\nto  direct  its  mind  to the  issue  and  to  make\r\n\r\nprovision  not  only in respect of  those  who  are\r\n\r\ncitizens  but  also in respect of  those  who  seek\r\n\r\nrelationship  with the territory. So, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhen   he   tells  us  that  it  is   contrary   to\r\n\r\nconstitutional provisions and that it is  a  deceit\r\n\r\nand  fraud upon the people, he just does  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  he  is  talking about. The Deputy Prime  Minister  is not the only one who does not know  what\r\n\r\nhe is talking about.

The\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister, who speaks  of  honesty - a\r\n\r\nword  that I say comes ill from his lips,  as  ill\r\n\r\nand  as  alien  as  the word \"national\"  which  he\r\n\r\ninsists   on   mispronouncing  in   such   foreign\r\n\r\nfashion - takes me to task for making a long  speech\r\n\r\nand  not moving my amendment. Mr Speaker, I  will\r\n\r\nexplain  very  simply. There is a  guillotine.  My\r\n\r\namendment is in fact incorporated in the amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  is now before the House. In essence, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  my purpose to seek to filibuster and take  up\r\n\r\nthe  time  of the House on unnecessary amendments.\r\n\r\nThis  is  one - this fourth one - which 17 of us  have\r\n\r\nagreed to and still agree to, Sir. Mr Speaker, if\r\n\r\nyou will remember, on the 9th of July - I might draw\r\n\r\nyour  attention to the exact page - at page 25 [col.\r\n\r\n35]  the Prime Minister said, the 5th line of  the\r\n\r\ntranscript:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'By reason and logic we are entitled to as much\r\n\r\nas what was afforded to the 11 States. I have said\r\n\r\nbefore,  and I repeat it now, that it is the  duty\r\n\r\nof  the  Government to see that we are treated  as\r\n\r\nfavourably as any of the other States.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  if  you  will  turn over the  page,  Sir,  he\r\n\r\nrepeats himself in the last paragraph [col. 38]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The first principle of any federation is that\r\n\r\nall  States  are dealt with equally and  that  the\r\n\r\nnorm, or rather, the equivalent [I ask you to note\r\n\r\nthe word 'equivalent'] of what was given to the 11\r\n\r\nStates  of the Federation should also be available\r\n\r\nto any new member if the new member desires it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the equivalent of giving the State of Johore\r\n\r\ncitizenship for its nationals is giving the  State\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  citizenship for  its  nationals.  A\r\n\r\nsubject  of  the Ruler in Johore, as a subject  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ruler in Kedah, as a subject of the Ruler  in\r\n\r\nSelangor,  is  in  an analogous  position  to  the\r\n\r\ncitizen  of  the  State of Singapore  who  is  the\r\n\r\nsubject of Her Majesty represented by the Yang di-Pertuan   Negara.   They  were   given   automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship  on  the formation of the  Federation.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime  Minister talks about his duty  to  see\r\n\r\nthat our people get equivalent treatment and equal\r\n\r\njustice. That is all this amendment seeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indeed unhappy to note, Sir, that a\r\n\r\nperfectly legitimate proposition which a third  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  seek  to put to the people  is  being\r\n\r\nresisted not by the Government, whom we can expect\r\n\r\nto  resist  anything  decent,  but  by  the  Front\r\n\r\nOpposition Bench - the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O.  We  have\r\n\r\nnever  suggested  that the White  Paper  proposals\r\n\r\nshould not be put to the people. In fact, we  urge\r\n\r\nthat  they should be honestly put. That  is  their\r\n\r\nstand and we are a hundred per cent with them that\r\n\r\nit  should  fairly  and squarely  be  put  to  the\r\n\r\npeople. Not with the word 'merger' that the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister seeks to tag on, but frankly as proposals\r\n\r\nfor  a  closer relationship. We have never, never,\r\n\r\nnever   had  a  shadow  of  doubt  that  we  would\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly support any attempt, every  attempt\r\n\r\nto put those proposals honestly to the people. Why\r\n\r\ndid  the  S.P.A. and U.M.N.O. object  to  another\r\n\r\nproposal  which,  in their eyes,  is  not  equally\r\n\r\nworthy,  but  which,  in our eyes,  is  much  more\r\n\r\nworthy  and  should  be  put  to  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  Why is that? In the context  of  their\r\n\r\nrejection  of  our amendment on the 6th  December,\r\n\r\n1961,  Sir,  they  said that it  was  put  up  for\r\n\r\npolitical  purposes  and they  would  support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Very well, they did it. But I say, the\r\n\r\nsame  reasons  no longer prevail. Here  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  (and  their own leader)  has  repeatedly\r\n\r\nsaid that all reasonable and possible alternatives\r\n\r\nwill  be put to the people. We are not asking  for\r\n\r\nall  possible alternatives; we are asking for  one\r\n\r\nalternative - an  honest  alternative,  a   simple\r\n\r\nalternative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know why it is constantly sought\r\n\r\nof  me to restate my stand, but let me explain  to\r\n\r\nyou  what  I understand by that alternative.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no misunderstanding. It means education\r\n\r\nand  labour  will  be  under Central  Governmental\r\n\r\ncontrol.  There  can  be no question  about  that,\r\n\r\nbecause,  to my mind, in our efforts  to  build  a\r\n\r\nunited  nation, it is healthier that there  should\r\n\r\nbe a uniform policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we are agreeable to it or not in its\r\n\r\nimplementation or its outline, will  be  a  matter\r\n\r\nfor constitutional effort to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namend and alter - not only for us but for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I say that what I understand by a complete\r\n\r\nand  genuine merger is that we will, in fact, seek\r\n\r\nno  special  consideration because of our  wealth,\r\n\r\nseek  no  special  consideration  because  of  our\r\n\r\nunique  economic and military value, but  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  seek  merely,  in all humility  and  in  all\r\n\r\nsincerity,  equality with the  other  States.  Our\r\n\r\nwealth will be, at the disposal of all. Let us not\r\n\r\nforget  that our per capita income is believed  to\r\n\r\nbe four times that of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a wonderful prize, Sir, and we are\r\n\r\nseeking  for  it  nothing but  what  is  basically\r\n\r\nright.  We  are  asking for no  premiums.  We  are\r\n\r\nasking  for  no special consideration. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwant  to go shouting that they want education  and\r\n\r\nlabour.  Let us put the alternatives then  bluntly\r\n\r\nto the people, Sir. That is fair enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you rather have education and labour and\r\n\r\nno   citizenship?   Or  would  you   rather   have\r\n\r\ncitizenship,   common   liabilities   and   common\r\n\r\nresponsibilities? That is fair enough. Sir. And  I\r\n\r\nwill be glad to take the P.A.P. on that basis  and\r\n\r\nto  see the referendum clearly fought along  those\r\n\r\nlines  as to whether the people of Singapore would\r\n\r\nbe   prepared  to  accept  loyally  to  be  on   a\r\n\r\ncompletely  equal basis with the other  States  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation - education, labour, finance - the lot\r\n\r\nin  the  hands of the Central Government  as  with\r\n\r\nevery  other State; or whether we seek the special\r\n\r\nprivileges  which the P.A.P. say we  seek - as  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. make  as  a donkey's carrot - in  order  to\r\n\r\nexcuse   the  sell-out  of  the  basic  issue   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands) (In Malay): Mr Speaker, just now we have\r\n\r\nheard  the Member for Anson attempting to \"tickle\"\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. in debating the amendment moved  by  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Thomson  in  connection   with   the\r\n\r\nalternatives put to the people of Singapore on the\r\n\r\nquestion of merger. I, on behalf of U.M.N.O.,  say\r\n\r\nunequivocally and sincerely that we do not wish to\r\n\r\nindulge in twists and turns and we loathe any, one\r\n\r\nwho indulges in such tactics and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho tries to mislead or do anything of that sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand, Mr Speaker, does not mean that it is\r\n\r\nbased on the wishes of the people but after having\r\n\r\ngiven  due  and  thorough  consideration  to   the\r\n\r\nproblem  whether  it  will be  beneficial  to  all\r\n\r\nstrata  of society.

So it is necessary for me to state my\r\n\r\nParty's  stand.  This is a matter  which  we  have\r\n\r\nthoroughly discussed and considered-the importance\r\n\r\nof  merger between Singapore and the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  and  Malaysia. Any  proposal  which  goes\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  confines of Command  Paper  33  is  a\r\n\r\npretext or is a manoeuvre to frustrate and destroy\r\n\r\nall  successes which we have been able to  achieve\r\n\r\nto  date, or by which we have been able to achieve\r\n\r\ncloser  relationship  between  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment moved by the Member for Thomson is\r\n\r\nnot  a new amendment. Indeed, this amendment  has,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  been debated in the past. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nsay  it  is not an amendment with good intentions,\r\n\r\nas we had hoped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, if\r\n\r\nyou  will allow me, I would like to dispose of one\r\n\r\nor  two  points raised by the Member for Anson  in\r\n\r\nconnection  with the speech made by my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanglin. He posed  the  question,\r\n\r\n\"how could the Member for Tanglin, in all honesty,\r\n\r\nhave  supported the second proposition put forward\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  the second proposition  being  a\r\n\r\ncomplete and unconditional merger as a state on an\r\n\r\nequal basis with the 11 other states in accordance\r\n\r\nwith   the   constitutional   documents   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya.\" He also asked  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin  what  exactly he understood  by  the\r\n\r\nsecond  proposition  before  he,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin,  agreed  that it was a  fair  proposition\r\n\r\nwhich  could  be  allowed to  go  forward  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In furtherance of the first point that he made\r\n\r\nagainst the Member for Tanglin, he inquired as  to\r\n\r\nhow the Member for Tanglin could think that it  is\r\n\r\na  workable  proposition when the Hon. the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of the Federation of Malaya himself  had\r\n\r\nsaid  that it was an unworkable proposition.  Now,\r\n\r\nto substantiate that, he quoted the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof the Federation as having said this - I hope I am\r\n\r\nnot  misquoting him - this is a note which I made  of\r\n\r\nhis statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We cannot take Singapore in a complete merger.\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of unhappiness.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the Tunku\r\n\r\nmeant  by  it when he said it, but I can tell  the\r\n\r\nHouse  what I understood by the Tunku's statement.\r\n\r\nI  understood the Tunku to mean this, that so  far\r\n\r\nas  proposition  (b), taking in Singapore  as  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth State is concerned, from the point of view\r\n\r\nof  the  Tunku, and from the point of view of  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  there  would be no  unhappiness.  The\r\n\r\nunhappiness  would  stem from Singapore.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  I understood the Tunku to mean when he said,\r\n\r\n\"We  cannot  take Singapore in a complete  merger.\r\n\r\nThere will be a lot of unhappiness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Anson is of the view that\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Prime Minister of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nmeant  that if he took Singapore in as the twelfth\r\n\r\nState,   there  would  be  unhappiness   for   the\r\n\r\nFederation. I certainly did not understand him  to\r\n\r\nmean that. And we all know, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson knows, the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nknows, the Member for Thomson knows --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification.

Now, as I was saying, the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nknows it, the Member for Queenstown knows it,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Thomson knows it, and we, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  all  of us who are in politics and who  have\r\n\r\nbeen in politics for some time know what the basic\r\n\r\ntrouble is. We know it, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  yet\r\n\r\nwe  do not mention what the basic trouble is in  a\r\n\r\nmerger  between  Singapore and the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Member for Thomson and I ask the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson this question, \"How could it have  been\r\n\r\npossible   for  the  British  to  have   separated\r\n\r\nSingapore from the Federation in the year 1946, if\r\n\r\nthe  people of the Federation of Malaya and if the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore had wanted to be together?\" Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I ask those responsible Members  to\r\n\r\nanswer  the question, \"Could anybody have kept  us\r\n\r\napart;  could the British have kept  us  apart  if\r\n\r\nboth of us had really wanted to be together?\" They\r\n\r\ncould not have. If Singapore had wanted it; if the\r\n\r\nFederation  had  wanted it, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  no\r\n\r\npower  on earth could have stopped it. The  reason\r\n\r\nfor  this  separation was that the Federation  did\r\n\r\nnot want us and we did not want to go in then; and\r\n\r\nthe  reasons are patent to everybody who takes  an\r\n\r\nintelligent and an honest interest, if I  may  say\r\n\r\nso,  Mr Speaker, Sir, in these matters. The basic\r\n\r\nproblem  is  the Chinese in Singapore overwhelming\r\n\r\nthe  Malays in the Federation. That is  the  basic\r\n\r\ntrouble.  We  know it. The Barisan  know  it.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. know  it. U.M.N.O. know it.  The  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty too know it. The problem has been, how could\r\n\r\nwe   reconcile  the  fears  of  the  Chinese,  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate interests of the Chinese, the fears  of\r\n\r\nthe Malays, the legitimate interests of the Malays\r\n\r\nin the Federation - how could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  fears be reconciled and the two peoples  be\r\n\r\nwelded  together  into  a  national  entity  in  a\r\n\r\nnational   unit?  That  was  always  the  problem.\r\n\r\nBecause there was no solution to the problem then,\r\n\r\nthe separation came. That was the basic problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the Tunku made that speech in the\r\n\r\nFederal Parliament, that is what I understood  him\r\n\r\nto  mean. The Member for Anson must know something\r\n\r\nof  this  problem because he was the  first  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  of Singapore. He must have discussed  it\r\n\r\nwith  the  Tunku himself, who was then  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister and later the Prime Minister. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson must have known what were the  problems\r\n\r\nthat  kept  the two territories apart and,  having\r\n\r\nunderstood  the difficulties of the  Federation\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister, he, then as Chief  Minister,  did\r\n\r\nnothing more about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nsaid,  he did say this, \"citizenship is the  sheet-anchor\" that is the basic difficulty in all  these\r\n\r\ndiscussions.  Now,  so far as proposition  (b)  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a proposition,\r\n\r\nto  my mind at least, which could be acceptable to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation,  but  it is a  proposition  which\r\n\r\nmight not be acceptable to Singapore, because in a\r\n\r\ncomplete and unconditional merger as a State on an\r\n\r\nequal  basis if we go in as any other State,  then\r\n\r\nwe  go  in  on  citizenship  proposals  which  are\r\n\r\nwritten into the Constitution already. Unless  and\r\n\r\nuntil  the Parliament of the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nover-rides  those provisions in the Constitutional\r\n\r\ndocuments  by an Ordinance, we cannot go  in  with\r\n\r\nall  our citizens converted into Federal citizens.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  proposition (b),  to  my  mind,  is  a\r\n\r\nworkable  proposition. It might be  a  proposition\r\n\r\nwhich  is not in our interest, but it is certainly\r\n\r\na  workable proposition from the point of view  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of  Malaya.  On  that  basis,  we\r\n\r\naccept,  because  if  it  is  acceptable  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation and it is acceptable to the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, of course, it can be worked.  If  there\r\n\r\nis  mutuality in this matter, the proposition  can\r\n\r\nbe  worked. Because of that, Mr Speaker, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nagree   to  proposition  (b).  There  is   nothing\r\n\r\nsinister  about  it.  It is a completely  workable\r\n\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I might come back to the actual\r\n\r\namendment  moved  by the Member  for  Thomson.  It\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(d) genuine merger of Singapore with the\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya,   with    Singapore\r\n\r\nentering the Federation as the twelfth  State\r\n\r\nand   with  all  its  Citizens  automatically\r\n\r\nbecoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The important words, to my mind, in this amendment\r\n\r\nare  \"genuine  merger\", \"automatically\",  \"Federal\r\n\r\nCitizens\".  By  genuine merger, I suppose  we  now\r\n\r\nmean  anything that the P.A.P. does not put forward.\r\n\r\nThe  next  problem  I have to  deal  with  is  the\r\n\r\nquestion of \"automatically\". Now, when the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  moved  his motion  on  this,  I  was\r\n\r\nwaiting  to hear whether he would tell  the  House\r\n\r\nexactly  what  he meant by automatic  citizenship.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  nothing   was\r\n\r\nforthcoming  from  him nor  from  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown as to exactly what they meant by saying\r\n\r\nautomatically becoming Federal citizens\". It  must\r\n\r\nhave  a  meaning, Mr Speaker, Sir, It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nphrase  which can be left standing in the air.  It\r\n\r\nmust  be related to some constitutional documents.\r\n\r\nIt  must be related to some legal position in  the\r\n\r\nFederation   before   we   can   truthfully    say\r\n\r\n\"automatically becoming Federal citizens\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson said this, By automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship  we mean something to be  negotiated.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  about all we got from him. So he himself\r\n\r\nhas   no   clear  idea  of  what   he   means   by\r\n\r\n\"automatically becoming Federal citizens\". So when\r\n\r\nhe says that it is something to be negotiated for,\r\n\r\nI  take it he means something on which we have  to\r\n\r\nreach an agreement with the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nNow,  if  the  Member for Thomson  had  made  this\r\n\r\nproposition  two or three or four or  five  months\r\n\r\nago,  I could see point in the statement. At  this\r\n\r\nlate  stage, I cannot, especially when  there  are\r\n\r\ndocuments now before the House from the Federation\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister which quite clearly indicate that,\r\n\r\nso  far  as negotiating for all Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nbecoming  Federal citizens is concerned,  that  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible.  Letters  from  the  Federal  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  which have been laid before the  House,\r\n\r\nclearly   say  that  if  you  want  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens to become Federal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens, automatically or in any other way,  that\r\n\r\nit  is quite impossible. That is the impression  I\r\n\r\ngot  from  reading  the letter of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. If the Member for Thomson  or  if\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson has other indications  from\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister or any other Ministers in  the\r\n\r\nFederation to the contrary, we have not  heard  of\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, we have been told that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  has been in communication  with  Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul  Rahman on this matter. Whether he  has  got\r\n\r\nany  further than the Singapore Government,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot know. But the point is that we are still being\r\n\r\ntold  by  the  Member  for Thomson  that  we  must\r\n\r\nnegotiate  with the Federation Government  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion of citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution, Mr Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare two ways by which citizenship can be acquired.\r\n\r\nOne  is automatic, as the Member for Thomson said,\r\n\r\nbecause it is by operation of law. By automatic, I\r\n\r\nunderstand it to mean, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  by operation of law. If it is through  a\r\n\r\nprocess  of  negotiation, it cannot be  automatic,\r\n\r\nbecause there is a third party intervening.  If  a\r\n\r\nthird  party  intervenes, it cannot  be  automatic\r\n\r\nbecause it is subject to another will. So when the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson puts down on the Order  Paper\r\n\r\nthe   phrase   \"automatically   becoming   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens\",  I  take it that he would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nrefer  to some constitutional document whereby  it\r\n\r\nwould  become possible, by operation of  law,  for\r\n\r\nall Singapore citizens on merger to become Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens.  The only clause which I  can  think  of\r\n\r\nwhich  might assist us on this matter  is  section\r\n\r\n22,  I  think. Section 22 talks of acquisition  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship, citizenship by operation of  law.  If\r\n\r\nyou  will  forgive  me, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  had\r\n\r\nbetter  read out the whole section, as I think  it\r\n\r\nrather important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to Clause (2) , the following persons\r\n\r\nare citizens by operation of law, that is to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) every person who, immediately before Merdeka\r\n\r\nDay,  was  a  citizen of  the  Federation  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  any  of  the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya   Agreement,   1948,\r\n\r\nwhether by operation of law or otherwise;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) every person born within the Federation\r\n\r\non or after Merdeka Day;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) every person born outside the Federation on\r\n\r\nor  after  Merdeka  Day  whose  father  is  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  at the time of the birth and  either\r\n\r\nwas born ---'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, It is not section 22 that he is reading from.\r\n\r\nI would like you to direct your mind to it, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I should have said section 14 (1).

Now, the other way in which a\r\n\r\nState  that  goes into the Federation can  acquire\r\n\r\ncitizenship is set out in section 22:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If any new territory is admitted to the\r\n\r\nFederation  in pursuance of Article 2,  Parliament\r\n\r\nmay  by  law  determine what  persons  are  to  be\r\n\r\ncitizens  by reason of their connection with  that\r\n\r\nterritory  and the date or dates from  which  such\r\n\r\npersons are to be citizens.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir,  there  are  two\r\n\r\nprocesses  by which citizens of an incoming  state\r\n\r\ncould   acquire   Federal   citizenship - one,    by\r\n\r\noperation  of  law as cited by me previously,  and\r\n\r\nthe other, by an Act of Parliament moved in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederal Parliament. Now, the first provision,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  section 14  (1),  is  a  statutory\r\n\r\nprovision and that acts on its own by operation of\r\n\r\nlaw,   but   section  22  is  purely  a  political\r\n\r\nprovision, it is in the Constitution. No doubt, it\r\n\r\nis  possible constitutionally, but what will bring\r\n\r\nit  on the Statute Books is a political attitude to\r\n\r\nthe  problem  that is proposed before the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament.  Now, the question of  a  State  being\r\n\r\nadmitted to the Federation is a political one. The\r\n\r\nquestion of who from that stage should be admitted\r\n\r\nas Federal citizens is a political one. Now, if my\r\n\r\narguments  up  till  now are correct,  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson, I ask the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  the question  of  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  becoming  Federal  citizens  is  not   a\r\n\r\npolitical one. If it is recognised that  it  is  a\r\n\r\npolitical one, can they, in all fairness,  say  it\r\n\r\nwhen  they  know,  when the Head  of  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  has told, them and told us,  and  told\r\n\r\nthe  House  that  it  is not  possible?  In  those\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  is  it fair to the  electorate  to\r\n\r\npose  them a question which we all, as responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens,  know and which the Assembly  knows,  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible? It is not practical politics. I  am\r\n\r\nnot telling the Member for Anson or the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson  that  it  is not an ideal  for  which  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  strive. It is an ideal, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  We all have ideas of how integration  should\r\n\r\ntake place. As people entrusted with the destinies\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, politics must not  be  looked  at\r\n\r\nfrom  the point of view of idealism alone; we must\r\n\r\nalso look at it from a practical point of view.\r\n\r\nIs  the  proposition, which is formulated  in  the\r\n\r\namendment,   Mr   Speaker,  Sir,   a   practical\r\n\r\nproposition? When we want to know whether it is  a\r\n\r\npractical proposition, we must view it against the\r\n\r\nbackground  of  the  possibilities  of  its  going\r\n\r\nthrough   the  Federal  Parliament.  If   we   are\r\n\r\nconvinced,  if we have been told that  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible,  what then is the point  of  posing  the\r\n\r\nproposition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We can wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Thank you.

If the Barisan Sosialis had\r\n\r\nmade  the  point, \"We wish to remain  as  we  are\r\n\r\ntoday,\" I would have respected them. Let them come\r\n\r\nout  openly and say, \"We want to remain a  colony\r\n\r\nof Great Britain.\" Whether I agree with that point\r\n\r\nof  view  or not, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will respect\r\n\r\nit.  There are numbers of people in Singapore  who\r\n\r\nmight  agree  with  the Barisan Sosialis  if  they\r\n\r\nchoose  to  remain a colony of Great  Britain.  At\r\n\r\nleast that is an honest point of view. But to  put\r\n\r\nto   the   electorate  the  question  which   they\r\n\r\nthemselves know cannot and will not be accepted by\r\n\r\nthe  Federation is a fraud of the highest  degree,\r\n\r\nto  my  mind. It is because of that, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, that my Party and I find ourselves unable  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  proposition  which  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson has suggested in his amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson said a vicious note was\r\n\r\nstruck  by  the  Singapore People's Alliance  when\r\n\r\nthey agreed to question (b) and would not agree to\r\n\r\nthe proposed question (d). I do not think it is  a\r\n\r\nvicious note, Mr Speaker, Sir, If I may turn  the\r\n\r\nphrase  on  him, I think it is he and the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  who  are  guilty of  the  vicious  note,\r\n\r\nproposing  something to an unsuspecting electorate\r\n\r\nwhich  they  themselves know cannot be acceptable.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the point? Let us say the Assembly  does\r\n\r\naccept   the  proposition  and  puts  it  to   the\r\n\r\nelectorate and everybody votes for it.  Then  what\r\n\r\nhappens?  The Federation says, \"No,  we  will  not\r\n\r\nhave  it.\"  What is the point of it, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir?  Unless there is some ulterior motive  behind\r\n\r\nall  this.  That  is  the only  possible  rational\r\n\r\nexplanation  I can think of - the ulterior  motive.\r\n\r\nIf  there  is no ulterior motive, it seems  to  be\r\n\r\nquite  senseless putting a question which we  know\r\n\r\nthe  Federation will not and cannot accept  today.\r\n\r\nMaybe  ten  years  hence, maybe  years,  but  not\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Maybe next month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Maybe next month.

It takes two  to  make  an\r\n\r\nagreement.  The  stand of the  Singapore  People's\r\n\r\nAlliance is that Command Paper 33 is a first step.\r\n\r\nIf  in  two months' time the Member for Anson  can\r\n\r\npersuade  the  Federation Government  to  give  us\r\n\r\nautomatic  citizenship, the second  step  and  the\r\n\r\nfinal  step will be taken. But when we  know  that\r\n\r\nthe  proposed fourth question is not  a  practical\r\n\r\npossibility,  I  think it would be a fraud  on  the\r\n\r\nelectorate to pose it to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  day  before last when I  mentioned  the\r\n\r\nsecond amendment  I was referring to the amendment\r\n\r\nto  be  moved by the Barisan Sosialis asking  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens should be  allowed  to  become\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens automatically. At that time,  we\r\n\r\nknew that the Barisan Sosialis had an intention to\r\n\r\nbring  up  this particular amendment. Subsequently\r\n\r\nthis  amendment  was  moved  by  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nThomson. So when the Member for Anson said  I  was\r\n\r\nreferring to him, according to the records of this\r\n\r\nAssembly, maybe there is a mistake in the script.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other day when I was\r\n\r\ndealing  with this matter, I clearly  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  I  hoped  that  the representatives  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis in moving this second  amendment\r\n\r\nshould  make  it clear whether they would  include\r\n\r\nthe  following meaning in this amendment, that  is\r\n\r\nto say, to allow the Central Government to control\r\n\r\neducation  and  labour. On the face  of  it,  this\r\n\r\namendment is like a man asking some children,  \"Do\r\n\r\nyou want to eat the meat of the heavenly swan?\"  I \r\n\r\nbelieve  everybody likes to try the  meat  of  the\r\n\r\nheavenly swan, but to be able to eat it, you  must\r\n\r\nfulfil  certain  conditions.  In  this  amendment,\r\n\r\nthere  is  the  suggestion that the  meat  of  the\r\n\r\nheavenly  swan is very palatable, but it does  not\r\n\r\nsay  what  conditions the people must comply  with\r\n\r\nbefore they can eat it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat  is to say, if you want to taste the meat  of\r\n\r\nthe  heavenly swan, you must be prepared to suffer\r\n\r\nsome stomach ache if it is necessary. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  even up to the present date we have not been\r\n\r\nable  to  see  any representatives of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis who are so frank as the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nwho  says  that  he  is prepared  to  accept  this\r\n\r\namendment on the one hand, and, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nhe  is  prepared to hand over the education policy\r\n\r\nand  the  labour policy and other matters  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Thomson and the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown   spoke  on  this  amendment,   I   was\r\n\r\nlistening  to them very attentively  to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhether they had any grand ideas. Unfortunately, I\r\n\r\nwas  unable  to  find out from them  whether  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  prepared  to  persuade  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to hand over the policies of  education\r\n\r\nand  labour  to  the Central Government.  We  were\r\n\r\nunable  to  hear  words clearly expressed  to  the\r\n\r\neffect that if the amendment is accepted, then the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government in future will not be able to\r\n\r\nmake  use of public funds to assist Chinese middle\r\n\r\nschools.  What  will  be  the  future  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity?  They would not dare  to  say  a  word\r\n\r\nabout it. Again those who do not know English  and\r\n\r\nMalay  will not be able to become Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. Then admission to the civil service will\r\n\r\nbe  based  on  the  four to  one  ratio,  so  that\r\n\r\npreference  is  given  to  Malays.  They  did  not\r\n\r\nmention   other  matters  which  are   now   being\r\n\r\npractised  in the Federation. They never mentioned\r\n\r\nthese  conditions before they said they wanted  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  people the meat of the swan. So  I  say\r\n\r\nthis amendment is humbug. It is humbug intended to\r\n\r\ndeceive the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody has either read in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers or heard in this house that  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of the Federation, in his reply  to\r\n\r\na letter from the Prime Minister of Singapore, has\r\n\r\nstated  clearly  that he cannot  accept  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens    becoming   automatically    Federation\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Therefore, I say the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  not  sincere in having merger. That  is  why\r\n\r\nthey have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurposely  brought up this amendment in  order  to\r\n\r\nclose the door to merger. The P.A.P. Government is\r\n\r\na Government that can face realities. We know that\r\n\r\nsince   the   time   the  colonialists   separated\r\n\r\nSingapore  from Malaya, we in Singapore  have  had\r\n\r\ntwo Chief Ministers who have tried their very best\r\n\r\nto  bring  about a reunification between Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation of Malaya.  These  two  Chief\r\n\r\nMinisters include the present Member for Anson who\r\n\r\nhimself has spoken to the Prime Minister of Malaya\r\n\r\non this matter. Even the Member for Cairnhill, who\r\n\r\nwas the second Chief Minister, has had talks about\r\n\r\nthis  matter;  but all their efforts  have  proved\r\n\r\nfutile.  It is the policy of P.A.P. Government  to\r\n\r\ntreat  Malaya  as  a nation. It will  never  treat\r\n\r\nSingapore as a nation. Therefore, when we came  to\r\n\r\npower,  we  took a very realistic view. With  this\r\n\r\nattitude  we  have tried to have  talks  with  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of the Federation of Malaya.  That\r\n\r\nis  how  the White Paper on merger has come about.\r\n\r\nAccording   to   the  present  circumstances   and\r\n\r\nconditions  prevailing  in Singapore,  this  White\r\n\r\nPaper   on  merger  will  pave  the  way   for   a\r\n\r\nreunification of Singapore with the Federation. We\r\n\r\ndo  not  say  it  is the ultimate  objective.  Our\r\n\r\nobjective  is to have a non-Communist, democratic,\r\n\r\nsocialist Malaya through merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson is a very clever lawyer,\r\n\r\nbut  I  feel  that, as a leader of the people,  he\r\n\r\nshould first have the prerequisite control of  his\r\n\r\nown  temper. A person who cannot control  his  own\r\n\r\ntemper  will  not  be able to hold  the  reins  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  of a country. Even when he represented\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore and went to  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom on a very important mission, he failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is quite entitled\r\n\r\nto  say, in passing, that the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\ngot  a short temper. But I do not think he can  go\r\n\r\nfurther than that. We are not interested in  other\r\n\r\ntimes  when  he  has lost his temper,  if  he  has\r\n\r\nindeed lost his temper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   the  second  point  which  the  Opposition,\r\n\r\nespecially the Member for Queenstown, has brought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  is that the representatives of the people must\r\n\r\nspeak for the interest of the people.

So  if he says that every  Member  from\r\n\r\nevery constituency must speak for the interest  of\r\n\r\nits  people, then the whole position will be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nsince  the  Member for Queenstown is not  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, may I clarify for him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

From his reasoning, it would\r\n\r\nappear   that   the   representative   of    every\r\n\r\nconstituency  must  speak for the  people  of  his\r\n\r\nparticular constituency. If we want to  listen  to\r\n\r\nthe people of your own constituency, and everybody\r\n\r\ndoes  so,  then  it  will  be  difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - supposing   the   people    in    every\r\n\r\nconstituency want more street lamps, where is  the\r\n\r\nmoney?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary has made\r\n\r\nhis point.

That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  the White Paper of the P.A.P has been brought\r\n\r\nup  in  the  interest of the  people  in  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nMalaya  are  just  like a couple  who  have  been\r\n\r\ndivorced  for over ten years. If this couple  want\r\n\r\nto  have a reunion, and if the man insists on  his\r\n\r\nown  conditions  and the woman also  on  her  side\r\n\r\ninsists  on  her  terms, then  it  will  be  quite\r\n\r\nimpossible.   If  both  sides  can   come   to   a\r\n\r\ncompromise, it will be possible for them to have a\r\n\r\nreunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already said in this\r\n\r\nHouse that the Barisan Sosialis basically does not\r\n\r\nwant  to  have merger. The Member for Thomson  and\r\n\r\nhis colleagues have said a great deal about merger\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and Malaya. They say this merger\r\n\r\nis  just like a marriage. They seem to me to  want\r\n\r\nto  take  Malaya  at  a time when  conditions  are\r\n\r\nsuitable  for  the victory of Communism.  If  they\r\n\r\nlook  at this matter from this point of view, then\r\n\r\nwe  can liken this view to the conditions existing\r\n\r\nbetween  the  mainland of China  and  Formosa.  It\r\n\r\nwould be a joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson says that merger is inevitable.\r\n\r\nIt is a long time since he said that. He said that\r\n\r\nonce  when  he was a Member of the P.A.P. and  he\r\n\r\nstopped saying it when merger came near. But now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  dawn  is  approaching and  his  manipulators\r\n\r\nunderstand  that it is not possible to  avoid  it,\r\n\r\nwhen they are already publicly saying now in their\r\n\r\nrecent  speeches - the  one  in  Pulau  Saigon  last\r\n\r\nSunday - chan  shih  ter  chou  cher,  a   temporary\r\n\r\nsetback for progressive forces. That is what  they\r\n\r\nare saying. Nobody in his right mind believes that\r\n\r\nthey really want this. What they want is no merger\r\n\r\nuntil,  of course, there is a Communist government\r\n\r\nin  the Federation. Then all is over. That is what\r\n\r\nthey  want. They do not like the word \"Communist\".\r\n\r\nThey  like  the  words \"progressive forces\".  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  is  not possible. History does not wait  for\r\n\r\nthe  Communists to fulfil the destiny of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Communists refuse to go in with  history,\r\n\r\nthen history will take place against their will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment that has been moved is dishonest in\r\n\r\nmany  respects.  First, having  exchanged  letters\r\n\r\nwith  the Tunku - they said the Tunku thanked  them,\r\n\r\nSir,  \"thank you for your kind regards.\" The Tunku\r\n\r\nwas  so  taken by surprise that these  people  had\r\n\r\nkind thoughts for him that he thought fit to thank\r\n\r\nthem for their salutation. Sir, what do they mean?\r\n\r\nIf  it  is  only they who were left to  negotiate,\r\n\r\nthen they would put the heat on. That is what they\r\n\r\nmeant.  How  would they put the heat on?  That  is\r\n\r\nsomething  they have not answered.  Vaguely,  they\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Ah  well, if only we were there,  something\r\n\r\nwould  happen.\" And I tell them what would happen.\r\n\r\nFirst, if we offer (d), if we agree to (d),  which\r\n\r\nis  something bogus, something which  we  know  is\r\n\r\nunobtainable, then they will campaign  for  it  on\r\n\r\nthe basis, that it is unobtainable. Then they say,\r\n\r\n\"Well,  there you are. Since it cannot be got,  it\r\n\r\nis  off.\" But let us assume, for one moment, it is\r\n\r\nobtainable. Then there is another condition,  Sir,\r\n\r\nanother  condition which the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nin  the  radio forum on the 26th reminded  us  of.\r\n\r\nThis is on page 5 of the radio transcript. \"Second\r\n\r\ncondition,  if  that is accepted.\" Then  be  said,\r\n\r\n\"proportional  representation  in  the  Federation\r\n\r\nParliament which will raise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nus  up\", according to them, \"from 15 to 25,  maybe\r\n\r\neven  30.\"  That  will make it difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nTunku to say \"yes\" or anybody to say \"yes\". But in\r\n\r\ncase  the Tunku says \"yes\" to that too, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown has got another condition - provided\r\n\r\nit  occurs immediately and is followed  by  a  Pan-Malayan  general election and the Tunku  dissolves\r\n\r\nhis  Government.  Then there is no  government  to\r\n\r\ncheckmate  them.  A  general  election  in   Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur; a general election in Singapore - a general\r\n\r\nmelee; anything can happen. That is what it is all\r\n\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> You are frightened of an\r\n\r\nelection!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We are not frightened of an\r\n\r\nelection.

It  is only worth while if we achieve  our\r\n\r\ncause, and that cause is the reunification of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories  and  the maintenance  of  racial\r\n\r\nharmony.  If  we allowed mad fellows to  go  round\r\n\r\nplaying a gambit in amendment (b), it would end up\r\n\r\nin  an  impasse  that would lead to hostility  and\r\n\r\nantipathy  between Singapore and  the  Federation,\r\n\r\nwhich  means  really  a  Malay  majority  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  and a Chinese majority  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich  would eventually end in a cleavage  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of the population of Singapore, Malaya  and\r\n\r\nthe Borneo territories, between the Malays and the\r\n\r\nChinese, that is what it means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Sir, knowing them well and knowing the\r\n\r\nlocal  situation intimately, we thought it prudent\r\n\r\nto try and bridge the widening gulf of 17 years of\r\n\r\nseparation by taking the reunification in  stages.\r\n\r\nThe  ideal  is complete and absolute merger - nobody\r\n\r\ndenies that. But I say anybody who tries to  bring\r\n\r\neducation   and   labour  into   line   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation's policy on these two subjects at  this\r\n\r\nmoment  knows - if he does not know it, then  he  is\r\n\r\nnot  fit to be in this Chamber - and if he knows and\r\n\r\nsays  that he wants to bring it about, then I  say\r\n\r\nhe  is  up  to  mischief. Even  with  education  a\r\n\r\nreserved subject, we saw an attempt to disrupt all\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese schools last December. Then,  at  the\r\n\r\nimpetuous  request  of the Member  for  Anson - from\r\n\r\ntime to time he has this irresistible impulse, and\r\n\r\nI  am  glad  he has betaken himself off from  this\r\n\r\nChamber, otherwise  he  might  land  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  in  more trouble by asking  more  things\r\n\r\nwhich  are  no  good for them - he asked  for  that\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry, and we accepted it. He  put\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown in a tough and  awkward\r\n\r\nposition because the Member for Queenstown had  to\r\n\r\nstand  up and say he supported the Commission  for\r\n\r\nInquiry.  But  no  sooner had  the  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  got going then they attempted to stage  a\r\n\r\nboycott  of  schools, strikes from classrooms  to\r\n\r\nstop  the Commission of Inquiry. That flopped too.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  with  education as a reserved  subject.\r\n\r\nDoes  anybody in his right mind believe  that  the\r\n\r\nChinese  school situation will be calm  as  it  is\r\n\r\ntoday with two massive attempts by the Communists,\r\n\r\nalready frustrated if education was going to go to\r\n\r\nthe  centre? What is the purpose of this. Sir?  To\r\n\r\nplay  a  dangerous game at all costs.  Since  they\r\n\r\ncannot  get  the people excited on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  cause, then they identify the Communist\r\n\r\ncause  with the Chinese cause generally. It is  as\r\n\r\nsimple  as that. Our business is not to allow  the\r\n\r\nChinese  to be so silly, so simple as to be  taken\r\n\r\nin  by the Communists. Just as the Communists,  we\r\n\r\nalso put up a united front.

He takes our amendment together  with\r\n\r\nthe other three proposals as four doors leading to\r\n\r\nthe  reunification  of the two  territories.  Now,\r\n\r\nthis  is quite correct. Our stand on merger  is  a\r\n\r\ndoor.  With  regard to the three other  proposals,\r\n\r\none is the P.A.P. White Paper on merger - this is  a\r\n\r\ndoor  through which the P.A.P. want  to  lead  the\r\n\r\npeople. We tell the people that this door does not\r\n\r\nlead to the reunification of the people of the two\r\n\r\nterritories. The second door which the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\ndistorted  is  proposed by the Barisan  Sosialis;\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. purposely say that this is a  trap  in\r\n\r\nthe  hope that the people will be intimidated into\r\n\r\nnot  making this choice. Now, the third  door  is\r\n\r\nthe  amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\nThis door is open, but it is quite dark inside and\r\n\r\nwhere it leads to nobody knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We propose this amendment in order to enable the\r\n\r\npeople  to  choose the right track  to  lead  them\r\n\r\ntowards  the reunification of the two territories.\r\n\r\nAlthough, according to the Prime Minister and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill, the other side of this  door\r\n\r\nis  bolted  by the Tunku, yet we have to  let  the\r\n\r\npeople  know. Just because this door is bolted  by\r\n\r\nthe Federation on the other side, we cannot make a\r\n\r\nwrong  choice  to lead the people, on  the  wrong\r\n\r\ntrack. The Member for Anson pointed out that  this\r\n\r\ndoor  was  closed  temporarily. We  can  wait  and\r\n\r\nduring  our  time  of  waiting,  we  can  make   a\r\n\r\nreasonable  appeal  to the Federation  Government.\r\n\r\nThe   impossibility  of  a  merger  of   the   two\r\n\r\nterritories  does not necessarily  mean  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  the  two  territories  will  live   as\r\n\r\nenemies.  If the Federation Government  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  temporarily  allow  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore to enter into the Federation, this  does\r\n\r\nnot follow that Singapore and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation  cannot adopt any economic  measure  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  the  people of the two  territories.  The\r\n\r\neconomic  barrier between the two  territories  is\r\n\r\nalready known to the people. I need not elaborate\r\n\r\non  it  here.  I just want to point out  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  are compelled to accept the door  selected\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. This is the sole interest  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  This can only be interpreted to mean  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are  trying to save their  own  fate.\r\n\r\nApart   from  that,  I  cannot  find   any   other\r\n\r\nexplanation or interpretation. The people of  this\r\n\r\ncountry can wait, but the P.A.P. cannot wait,  and\r\n\r\nwe understand this point very clearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park quoted Article 22 of\r\n\r\nthe  Federal  Constitution and he  explained  that\r\n\r\nthis  provision  is  a  political  provision.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the merger of Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nis   a  political  matter.  We  request  that  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore should automatically  become\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens on Merger Day. This  is  also  a\r\n\r\npolitical   matter.  Since  this  is  a  political\r\n\r\nmatter,  I  see  no reason why it  should  not  be\r\n\r\nsolved  by political means. What we object  to  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. are playing  a  game  of  party\r\n\r\npolitics  on  this  question of  merger.  But  our\r\n\r\ncontention that all Singapore citizens must become\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens  is  one that  transcends  party\r\n\r\npolitics.  I  think the Member  for  Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nshould  understand  this. Now  the  whole  dispute\r\n\r\ncentres  on  this point, that is, what  questions,\r\n\r\nshould  be  put on a ballot paper in the  national\r\n\r\nreferendum for the choice of the people? Our  main\r\n\r\nidea  is to find out the views of the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore citizens on merger. If we only  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Federation Government may  not  accept,\r\n\r\nthen this will be a matter on which we can consult\r\n\r\nthem.  It  is  not  a matter on  which  we  should\r\n\r\nconsult  the  people of Singapore. We  should  not\r\n\r\nconsider first what the political leaders  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation think but what the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nthink  of  merger.  The P.A.P.  Government  should\r\n\r\nunderstand that they were elected by the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and so, in the first place,  they  must\r\n\r\nconsult  them. We should, in the first place,  get\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npositive opinion of the people of Singapore before we\r\n\r\nopen  negotiations with the Federation Government.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the Federation Government is a realistic\r\n\r\nGovernment  and if the Singapore Government  can  get\r\n\r\nthe  concerted support of the people for negotiations\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation Government, then I believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  result of such negotiations will be much  better\r\n\r\nthan  what has been obtained by a few P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nin their talks with the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his speech just now has said that our amendment is a dishonest amendment. His only reason for saying so is that the Barisan stand on merger asks for proportionate representation in the Central Parliament and pan-Malayan general elections\r\n\r\nwhen the arrangements for merger have been completed.\r\n\r\nHe  says  that  the  tabling  of  this  amendment  is\r\n\r\ndishonest because of these two conditions. I will say\r\n\r\nthat his remark is itself dishonest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Minister for Finance stressed time\r\n\r\nand  again that our stand of true and complete merger\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  more advantageous to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He  said  that  the  White  Paper  merger\r\n\r\nproposals  would, on the other hand, give the  people\r\n\r\nsomething more. This comparison is just like  telling\r\n\r\na  girl  that she had better get married because  she\r\n\r\nwould  then be given a car, a house and a  key  to  a\r\n\r\nsafe  deposit box. But we on this side of  the  House\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the stand of the P.A.P. on merger,  which\r\n\r\npromises so many things, will not be accepted by  the\r\n\r\npeople;  that  is to say, the girl may not  be  happy\r\n\r\nwith  all the comforts given to her because there  is\r\n\r\nsomething  lacking, and that is the legal status  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  her marriage. We propose that  we  must\r\n\r\nhave equal rights with those of the Federal citizens.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the point we want to stress and it  is  the\r\n\r\nsame as insisting on security and the legal status of\r\n\r\na marriage. I believe that many people on matrimonial\r\n\r\nmatters must first consider whether such a union will\r\n\r\nhe  afforded  any legal status. Now, the  P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nasking  the  people not to have such a legal  status.\r\n\r\nThat means they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare asking the people not to have citizenship rights.\r\n\r\nInstead  they  only  ask the  people  to  have  cars,\r\n\r\nhouses,  labour, and education. That is all. Just  to\r\n\r\ninduce   the  people.  We  therefore  see  that   our\r\n\r\namendment, to the motion can be compared on  similar\r\n\r\nlines with the P.A.P. White Paper on merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister said a few moments ago that if merger could not ensure that\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  be  given autonomy  in  labour  and\r\n\r\neducation, then Singapore would have some misfortune.\r\n\r\nI  want  to ask: if there is complete merger  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Federation and if there should  be\r\n\r\nany  misfortune arising out of autonomy in labour and\r\n\r\neducation, who should shoulder the responsibility? We\r\n\r\ncannot agree with the arguments of the P.A.P. because\r\n\r\ntoday,  apart  from  asking  for  merger,  they  have\r\n\r\nforgotten  their political ideologies and convictions\r\n\r\nat  the  time  when  the Party was formed.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,    they   have   forgotten   their   socialist\r\n\r\nprinciples. Otherwise, they should avoid accusing and\r\n\r\nscolding  people  who want to have  equal  rights  in\r\n\r\nlabour  and education and other matters. Instead  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. should persuade the leaders of the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment to change their policy. That should be the\r\n\r\nproper thing to be done by a truly socialist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance said towards the end of his speech yesterday that we should pay attention to what he said, so that we would not regret in future. He told us that if we should continue to oppose the P.A.P. type of merger, then we would have misfortune\r\n\r\nfalling on our heads. Here, I would like to tell  him\r\n\r\nthis - there  is  nothing for us to regret  because  we\r\n\r\nfeel that the Greater Malaysia Plan is a plan of  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  In  opposing  the  colonial  plot   or\r\n\r\nintrigue,  no matter what difficulties we Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis will come across in future,  we\r\n\r\ntoday  in  the present struggle have gained more  and\r\n\r\nmore  respect  from the people, in the  meantime,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  very successful in exposing the  colonial\r\n\r\nstooges, not like the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, much has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  about changing and somersaulting. Let us see,\r\n\r\nSir, who is somersaulting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> S.P.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: We are now faced with an\r\n\r\namendment  moved  by the Member for  Thomson  which\r\n\r\nasks  for a fourth question. Then immediately after\r\n\r\nthat,  from  the  Order Paper, you  see  their  own\r\n\r\nleader  saying, again after many repetitions,  that\r\n\r\nhe wants one question. Let us have it, Sir. Do they\r\n\r\nwant  one question, or do they want four questions?\r\n\r\nIt  has been one question over the radio forum;  it\r\n\r\nhas  been one question at the rallies; it has  been\r\n\r\none question in this Chamber; and now he wants four\r\n\r\nquestions. Then back again, immediately after that,\r\n\r\none  question  again. They cannot decide,  Sir.  Do\r\n\r\nthey  want one question or four questions?  Who  is\r\n\r\nsomersaulting? The S.P.A. or the Barisan Sosialis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Cairnhill proposed question\r\n\r\n(c).  It  was  said  that  he  was  dishonest,  not\r\n\r\nsincere, somersaulting. I cannot remember what they\r\n\r\nsaid, Sir, but they said a lot of things about him.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Queenstown himself said- or  rather\r\n\r\nhe  meant it as an accusation - that the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  has put in amendment (c) because  it  is\r\n\r\nacceptable  to  the Federation. Sir,  is  it  their\r\n\r\npolicy   to  put  down  questions  which  are   not\r\n\r\nacceptable to the Federation? What do they get  out\r\n\r\nof  it? Is it not the right thing to do - to see that\r\n\r\nin  a  merger,  which concerns  two  parties,  both\r\n\r\nparties must accept the terms? And would it not  be\r\n\r\neasier  and  more  smooth sailing if  both  parties\r\n\r\naccept  it?  Yet  it  was meant  as  an  accusation\r\n\r\nagainst  the Member for Cairnhill - that he  puts  it\r\n\r\nthere  because  he  knows it is acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation, is it a crime to put in a question that\r\n\r\nwe know is acceptable to the Federation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon, I think, has said\r\n\r\nthat it is the people of Singapore we must consult,\r\n\r\nand  not the people in the Federation. And I  think\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Queenstown  has  said  that   we\r\n\r\nrepresent the people of Singapore and why are  we,\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A.,  speaking on behalf of the Federation?\r\n\r\nWe  are  not  speaking on behalf of the Federation.\r\n\r\nWhat we propose to the people must be something\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractical and preferably if we know it is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  accepted  by  the Federation.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the Member for Cairnhill knows whether  it\r\n\r\nwas  to  be accepted by the Federation or not,  but\r\n\r\nall  credit to him if he knew it was to be accepted\r\n\r\nwhen he put it down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> May I remind the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten  that  we  are  not  debating  the\r\n\r\namendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill? We are\r\n\r\ndebating  the  amendment moved by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson. So may I suggest that since the hon.  Lady\r\n\r\nhas  not  yet  spoken  on  the  original  question,\r\n\r\nperhaps she could reserve all those arguments until\r\n\r\nwe come to the original Question, as amended by the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill, and after we have disposed of\r\n\r\nall the amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwith  due  respect  to  you,  I  was  not  debating\r\n\r\nquestion (c). I was answering the charges  made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Members  of the Barisan Sosialis  against  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill. However, Sir, I will pass  on\r\n\r\nas  you have ruled. I would say that amendment  (d)\r\n\r\nis  not  only  not  practical  but  not  necessary,\r\n\r\nbecause we have the 11 States of the Federation and\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  three  territories  of  Borneo\r\n\r\ninvolved  in Malaysia. Questions (a), (b)  and  (c)\r\n\r\ncover  all  the  aspects. (a)  is  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Singapore has agreed with  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the Federation; (b) is what the  eleven\r\n\r\nStates are getting; and (c) is what the other three\r\n\r\nterritories  are  getting. Therefore,  these  three\r\n\r\ncover  all  the grounds of all the people concerned\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia.  Singapore is given the  supreme  and\r\n\r\nunique privilege of choosing any of them, that  is,\r\n\r\non  the basis of the eleven states or on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  the  three territories in Borneo. So by  having\r\n\r\n(d),  what new ground are we covering? Nothing that\r\n\r\nconcerns  all  the people or the  States  that  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  Malaysia. I say it is not  practical,\r\n\r\nSir,  because we are asking not to be like everyone\r\n\r\nelse  that  is  involved. We are given  the  unique\r\n\r\nprivilege,  as I have said, to choose  any  one  of\r\n\r\nthem. We are not satisfied with that, but we say we\r\n\r\nmust have much more than that. It is good if we can\r\n\r\nget  it,  Sir.  But we must consider that  although\r\n\r\nTunku Abdul Rahman may be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister,  he too  must  consider  the\r\n\r\nfeelings of the people who had elected him.  There\r\n\r\nwould  be  pressures on him if he started treating\r\n\r\nSingapore  as his blue-eyed adopted child.  So  he\r\n\r\nhas  to give consideration to both sides, Sir, our\r\n\r\npeople  as  well as the practicability  of  it  in\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And talking about vagueness. They say (b) and\r\n\r\n(c) are vague. It is an unknown quantity and so on\r\n\r\nand  so  forth. Look at (d), Sir, Is it not vague?\r\n\r\nGenuine merger! I wonder whether anybody can  give\r\n\r\nme a legal interpretation from any law book of the\r\n\r\nterm \"genuine merger\". Sir, if you say you want  a\r\n\r\ngenuine ruby, I know what you mean. But if you say\r\n\r\ngenuine   red,  what  is  genuine  red?   Crimson?\r\n\r\nVermilion? Dark red? Light red? Dull red? Which do\r\n\r\nyou  consider a genuine red? When you say \"genuine\r\n\r\nmerger\",   I   think   you   need   to   have   an\r\n\r\ninterpretation of what it means. It is more  vague\r\n\r\nthan  the others. At least (b) says, like  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  States. And all you have to do is to take out\r\n\r\nthe  constitution  of  the eleven  States  or  the\r\n\r\ncontract  of  the eleven States and  see  what  it\r\n\r\nmeans.  (c)  is a little vague. Yes, I admit,  \"no\r\n\r\nless favourable\". But it is favourable to us, Sir.\r\n\r\nThat vagueness is to our advantage. It is not less\r\n\r\nfavourable. That means we can ask for more. If  we\r\n\r\nthink the terms of the three territories of Borneo\r\n\r\nare  not  sufficient, all right, we will  ask  for\r\n\r\nmore.  That vagueness is to our advantage.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  to  our disadvantage. So I do not see why  we\r\n\r\nare quarrelling with that type of vagueness. As  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  the  vagueness of genuine  merger  is  more\r\n\r\ndangerous  because we do not know what  it  means.\r\n\r\nThen  they  will say as the twelfth State.  On  an\r\n\r\nequal  basis? An unequal basis? A better basis?  A\r\n\r\nworse  basis? How? Is it clear, Sir? Is  there  no\r\n\r\nvagueness  in  that  as the  twelfth  State?  How?\r\n\r\nProbably it is in their minds \"on an equal basis\".\r\n\r\nBut  as it is, I see it is more vague than (b)  or\r\n\r\n(c). They are probably to our disadvantage. Sir, I\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now  that it was not practical, apart\r\n\r\nfrom the pressures that I mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown himself said this. In\r\n\r\nhis  own words, he said that the Tunku said it was\r\n\r\npossible to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nautomatic  citizenship. But he  himself  said  the\r\n\r\nTunku  said that he would not grant it. Now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhy  ask the people, \"Do you want it?\" and in  the\r\n\r\nnext  breath tell them, \"But you know you are  not\r\n\r\ngoing to get it. The Tunku does not want it.\" As I\r\n\r\nhave  pointed out, it has to be accepted  on  both\r\n\r\nsides to be practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson gave as an example of\r\n\r\nthe  dishonesty of the two questions (b) and  (c).\r\n\r\nHe says, if a girl says, \"I want to marry Mr X. I\r\n\r\ndo not want to marry Mr A. I do not want to marry\r\n\r\nMr  B.  I do not want to marry Mr C. I  want  to\r\n\r\nmarry  Mr  X.\" Is that dishonesty? he asked.  No,\r\n\r\nSir.  Not  if the girl says it. But if the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson, knowing that the man, Mr X, is already\r\n\r\nmarried  or for some reason cannot marry the  girl\r\n\r\nand  goes to the girl and says, \"Do not marry  Mr\r\n\r\nA.  Do not marry Mr B. Do not marry Mr C. Insist\r\n\r\non Mr X. I will help you to get Mr X.\" I call it\r\n\r\ndishonesty. That is where the dishonesty comes in.\r\n\r\nWhen  you  know that Mr X is already married,  or\r\n\r\nnot  able  for some reason or other to  marry  the\r\n\r\ngirl - it  is not possible for her to marry  him - and\r\n\r\nyet you tell her, \"Do you want Mr X?\" and insist,\r\n\r\n\"Do  not marry Mr A. Do not marry Mr C.\" If  the\r\n\r\ngirl  herself,  knowing Mr X  is  married,  says,\r\n\r\n\"Since I cannot marry Mr X, well, I prefer to  be\r\n\r\nunmarried all my life.\" Not dishonesty.  I  agree.\r\n\r\nThe  answer  to  his question is  no.  It  is  not\r\n\r\ndishonesty. But the analogy is not quite  correct.\r\n\r\nIn  this  case we are telling the electorate,  \"Do\r\n\r\nnot  have the White Paper. Do not have Borneo.  Do\r\n\r\nnot  have  an equal basis with the eleven  States.\r\n\r\nAsk for automatic citizenship.\" Knowing that it is\r\n\r\nnot   available,  that  is  where  I  say  it   is\r\n\r\ndishonest, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably, Sir, with all these long sittings, we\r\n\r\nare  all  getting quite tired and easily confused.\r\n\r\nWith  all  this  double talk of somersaulting - when\r\n\r\nthey  accuse us of double somersaulting, and  when\r\n\r\npeople who accuse them somersault themselves - I can\r\n\r\nquite  understand the interpreters themselves  are\r\n\r\ngetting  confused  with double  negatives.  It  is\r\n\r\ntypical  of  the  Barisan. They have  confused  us\r\n\r\nenough.  Now  they are using double negatives  and\r\n\r\nconfusing the interpreters too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what would be the result if the people\r\n\r\nchose  (d)?  Let us say that the majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople voted for (d). What would be the result? No\r\n\r\nmerger. Then they say, \"Why not?\" Why can  we  not\r\n\r\nwait? We can wait. The P.A.P. cannot wait because\r\n\r\nthey  are toppling. But we can wait. Probably they\r\n\r\nare  right in one way. The P.A.P. is toppling  and\r\n\r\ncannot  wait  and  all  that.  But  where   I   am\r\n\r\nconcerned,  I too can wait, Sir. But  let  us  see\r\n\r\nwhether the waiting is going to benefit us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you are looking for a job as a general\r\n\r\nmanager  of  a firm. You go there and  the  people\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Well,  you are new. I do not have  so  much\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  you.  Let  us  start  you  as   an\r\n\r\nassistant manager.\" The firm says, \"You want  $500\r\n\r\nor  $600 pay. We will give you $400 or $450.\"  You\r\n\r\nsay, \"No fear. Give me a general manager's job  or\r\n\r\nnone at all.\" And the firm say, \"No vacancy. Prove\r\n\r\nyour worth. We will give it to you when there is a\r\n\r\nvacancy, and when you have proved your worth.\" You\r\n\r\nsay,  \"No, no, no. I will go jobless. I will wait.\r\n\r\nLet  me be jobless. Unless I get $600 as a general\r\n\r\nmanager, I will not work.\" I will not wait, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know,  because opinions differ.  I  would\r\n\r\nrather take up the job as assistant manager, prove\r\n\r\nmy worth, and then get promoted to general manager\r\n\r\nif I am worthy of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Well, what\r\n\r\nyou  are doing is that you are advocating that the\r\n\r\ngirl should be a mistress. Is it right that if she\r\n\r\ncannot marry Mr X until seven years more she must\r\n\r\nnow be his mistress?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>\r\n\r\nThere is the Women's Charter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Seow Peck Leng: But mistress, can. Even in\r\n\r\nthe  Women's  Charter,  you  can  be  a  mistress.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Sir, this analogy is again wrong because a\r\n\r\nmistress  is someone who is ostracized by society,\r\n\r\nlooked down upon by the law of the land; it is not\r\n\r\nlegal,  it  is also looked down upon  morally.  If\r\n\r\nSingapore  goes through with the White  Paper,  is\r\n\r\nthe   rest   of  the  world  going  to   ostracise\r\n\r\nSingapore? Or are we going to lose our trade?  If\r\n\r\nwe go through the White Paper merger, if Singapore\r\n\r\nis  going to be looked down upon and everybody  in\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of  the world says, \"Ha, you  become  a\r\n\r\nmistress now, we will not be friends with you;  we\r\n\r\nwill  not  have anything to do with you,\"  are  we\r\n\r\ngoing to lose our prestige? Are we going to  lose\r\n\r\nour trade? So the comparison with the mistress  is\r\n\r\nnot  quite fair. It would be more fair to  compare\r\n\r\nit  with  my example of if you cannot be a manager\r\n\r\ntoday,  well, be the assistant manager  first.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be more fair to compare it that way because\r\n\r\nboth  are  working towards certain advantages;  no\r\n\r\ndoubt complete merger is like the general manager,\r\n\r\nbigger  pay  probably, better,  but  then  we  are\r\n\r\naccepting a lesser pay towards a bigger result. We\r\n\r\nare not accepting something that is ostracized  or\r\n\r\nis  legally and morally looked down upon. So, Sir,\r\n\r\nfrom  that  point  of view, I do  not  think  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  can be termed to be a mistress  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Probably  we  are  starting   as   an\r\n\r\nunimportant  little brother trying  to  prove  his\r\n\r\nworth  to become one day a brother whom the  elder\r\n\r\nbrother will look up to with respect - as the S.P.A.\r\n\r\nsaid  during  the merger debate that this  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst step towards complete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis say that automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is possible and that  the  Tunku  has\r\n\r\nsaid  it  is  possible. Probably, Sir, I  am  not\r\n\r\narguing  that it is not possible, and the more  we\r\n\r\nknow  that it is possible, the more we should work\r\n\r\ntowards  that  objective. And how should  we  work\r\n\r\ntowards it? The way that they are doing, Sir?  Not\r\n\r\neven  the  way the P.A.P. have been behaving.  And\r\n\r\nthey must admit this, I am sure in their hearts of\r\n\r\nhearts - if  they  do not admit it  now,  they  will\r\n\r\nadmit  it  in  their hearts of hearts - their  past\r\n\r\nbehaviour   of   having  collaborated   with   the\r\n\r\nCommunists.    They   themselves    called    them\r\n\r\nCommunists.  I do not know whether they  are,  but\r\n\r\nthey  now  call them Communists. They collaborated\r\n\r\nwith  the  Communist front people; they befriended\r\n\r\nthem, shielded them, held them, came to power with\r\n\r\ntheir  help  and all that. That type of  behaviour\r\n\r\nnaturally calls for suspicion from the Federation,\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation  at once  says,  \"Beware,  be\r\n\r\ncareful;  do  not come too close, do not  get  too\r\n\r\nmuch  involved.\" That is the natural  reaction  of\r\n\r\nanybody, and the present behaviour of the Barisan,\r\n\r\nwith  the  P.A.P. shouting  Communists  at  them,\r\n\r\nrightly or wrongly --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Can we  blame  them?\r\n\r\nInstead of taking this and saying, \"All right, you\r\n\r\ntake this opportunity; you will eat your own words\r\n\r\nlater  on.  We will prove our worth; we will  show\r\n\r\nyou  what a good small brother we are; and we will\r\n\r\nprove   to   you   and  we  will   get   automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\" If it is possible, as they say it is\r\n\r\npossible,  and the Tunku has said it is  possible,\r\n\r\nwell then let us work towards it and not behave in\r\n\r\nthe  way they are behaving. The way that they  are\r\n\r\nbehaving,  Sir, is driving more and more  fear  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.

At the  end  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's motion as amended, to add\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) genuine merger of Singapore with the\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya,   with    Singapore\r\n\r\nentering the Federation as the twelfth  state\r\n\r\nand   with  all  its  Citizens  automatically\r\n\r\nbecoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nadded, be there added.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chan Choy Siong (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  the  past few days the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers  have  been saying that we have  distorted\r\n\r\ntheir  stand.  But  what  is  the  fact?  Have  we\r\n\r\ndistorted their stand? Is it necessary for them to\r\n\r\nintroduce this amendment today? It is very  simple\r\n\r\nto  answer this question. I believe many people in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have received a copy of  the  manifesto\r\n\r\ngiven by the Barisan Sosialis as a gift to each of\r\n\r\nthem.  Now this has been their stand all along.  I\r\n\r\nhave  here a copy of the manifesto of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. I will quote paragraph 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our stand on constitutional future\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reunification of our country and our\r\n\r\npeople - there are two alternatives before us - one is\r\n\r\nimmediately  to  establish  a  full  and  complete\r\n\r\nmerger   with  Singapore  becoming  one   of   the\r\n\r\ncomponent states of the Federation like Penang and\r\n\r\nMalacca.  The  second alternative  is  to  form  a\r\n\r\nconfederation   with  Singapore   retaining   full\r\n\r\ninternal  self-government, if possible,  with  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories joining the confederation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion by our Prime Minister includes the two\r\n\r\nquestions as suggested by the Barisan Sosialis and\r\n\r\nas  appearing in their manifesto. From this we can\r\n\r\nsee whether we have distorted their stand, as they\r\n\r\nhave  accused us. This, I think, can be very clear\r\n\r\nto  all  the  people of Singapore. The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore also know what is the true stand of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis on merger. And it is also because\r\n\r\nthey  have  such a stand that is why at the  radio\r\n\r\nforum on the question of merger, the leader of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, who was present then, gave  his\r\n\r\nopinion. Our Minister for Finance was also present\r\n\r\nand he accepted their opinion. But when they found\r\n\r\nthis  was not what the people who are manipulating\r\n\r\nbehind   the   Barisan   Sosialis   wanted,   they\r\n\r\nimmediately changed their stand by requesting  for\r\n\r\nautomatic conversion of citizenship. That is  also\r\n\r\nwhat  is contained in the amendment introduced  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Thomson today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, history progresses with time.\r\n\r\nThe  question of merger today is not a  fact  yet.\r\n\r\nBut  we  all can see that the wishes of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  the Federation of Malaya  and  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories for a united country will  soon\r\n\r\nmaterialise. However, today we have certain people\r\n\r\nsitting opposite who are dreaming and who want  to\r\n\r\nask  for  the  stars and things  which  cannot  be\r\n\r\nrealised  to  be  their  merger  proposals.  Their\r\n\r\nputting forward such a proposition shows what they\r\n\r\nare.  But  they  cannot block  merger  from  being\r\n\r\nrealised.  Members of the Opposition  Parties  and\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis are struggling for survival.\r\n\r\nThat  is why, being in this predicament, they have\r\n\r\nintroduced  such an amendment as this  one  before\r\n\r\nthis  House.  But I am afraid their last  struggle\r\n\r\nmay be too late, because the people have known for\r\n\r\na very long time that the Barisan Sosialis are not\r\n\r\nsincere on the merger issue. Why do they appear to\r\n\r\nbe so keen on trying to secure citizenship for the\r\n\r\n600,000-odd  citizens of Singapore? I  think  they\r\n\r\nare  only trying to use it as a cover and as a red\r\n\r\nherring  in order to divert the people's attention\r\n\r\nfrom  their  actual motive of frustrating  merger.\r\n\r\nToday they say that merger is good, but the people\r\n\r\nhave not accepted their word at its face value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have made another great blunder. They keep\r\n\r\non  harping  on  the  theory of  independence  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They put forward this theory  when  in\r\n\r\nfact  they are living in an ivory tower. Is  it  a\r\n\r\nrealistic  way out? I would say no. The road  they\r\n\r\nhave  been advocating is not a realistic way  out.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  blind alley leading to death. With  the\r\n\r\nbrains  they possess, they could now say that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have changed their stand,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhoping  that the P.A.P. will follow them into  the\r\n\r\nblind alley.

Member\r\n\r\nthat  we are on the amendment moved by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson? Perhaps she should come back to  the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chan Choy Siong (In Mandarin): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I only intended to  mention  these\r\n\r\nfacts to show that they had some relationship with\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  moved by the Member  for  Thomson,\r\n\r\nand, as I have said just now, because they do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  see the realisation of a united  Malaya.\r\n\r\nThey  want to topple the P.A.P. in order to thwart\r\n\r\nthe progress of merger. But the progress of events\r\n\r\nis  not  something  that  everybody  can  foresee.\r\n\r\nReunification of the two territories perhaps might\r\n\r\ntake  quite  a long time. History has gone  beyond\r\n\r\nour expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Thomson has today introduced this motion. If they have confidence in\r\n\r\nmerger  and  are sincere about it, why,  when  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper on merger was introduced and  debated\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly, since that time and  all  this\r\n\r\ntime   have   they  been  trying  to   block   the\r\n\r\nrealisation  of merger? It is because  they  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  White Paper of the P.A.P. on merger  is\r\n\r\nthe correct one in the eyes of the people. But  to\r\n\r\nthe  minority in the Barisan Sosialis  it  may  be\r\n\r\ndetrimental to them. That is why they are all  the\r\n\r\ntime saying that it is a kind of sell-out plan and\r\n\r\nthey  have  been  arguing  that  this  plan,  when\r\n\r\nrealised,  will bring bankruptcy to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and is only in the interest  of  a  few\r\n\r\nMinisters.  They say it is to save the P.A.P  from\r\n\r\nbankruptcy. If it is so, then there will  be  many\r\n\r\ncountries   in   the   world   where   there    is\r\n\r\ndictatorship, and they hope, if Singapore is still\r\n\r\na  colony, they may be in a better position.  Even\r\n\r\nif  merger  is  now realised, in the  coming  five\r\n\r\nyears we will have to face the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  again and be judged by them in  regard  to\r\n\r\nwhat we have done in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the Barisan Sosialis and\r\n\r\ntheir fellow travellers, however hard they try  to\r\n\r\ncover  up their intentions, and however hard  they\r\n\r\ntry  to  wreck merger, cannot prevent merger  from\r\n\r\nbeing realised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon has said that if\r\n\r\nthe propositions from Singapore are not acceptable\r\n\r\nto  the Federation, then they could wait. But  are\r\n\r\nwe  going  to wait for a hundred years, a thousand\r\n\r\nyears? Also during the time of waiting, what about\r\n\r\nthe  economy and the livelihood of the  people  in\r\n\r\nthese  two territories? How are they going  to  be\r\n\r\nresolved? But they say they can tell the people to\r\n\r\nwait - wait until one day when the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  has  a government like theirs, then  there\r\n\r\ncan be merger. It is still not too late. But under\r\n\r\nthe  present  circumstances, the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nknow,  and the people of Singapore also are aware,\r\n\r\nthat  the  objectives and wishes  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   are  something  that  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot wait to see materialise. But  why\r\n\r\ndo  the  Barisan  Sosialis not want  to  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople?   They   are  waiting  for   a   Communist\r\n\r\ngovernment  to appear to help them  carry  on  the\r\n\r\ntype  of  merger  they want. If so,  how  can  the\r\n\r\npeople  feel  that  theirs is a  honest  political\r\n\r\nParty?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Upper Serangoon\r\n\r\nsays  that the arrangements by the P.A.P. and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  are  as  a  result  of  the   P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nintrigues. He says he and members of his Party are\r\n\r\nnot  afraid  of the consequences that will  follow\r\n\r\nthe materialisation of such arrangements, and that\r\n\r\nthey will struggle against any such consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis mouth theories, but when\r\n\r\nthe  time comes, they may retreat. I remember that\r\n\r\nat  the time when Indonesia wanted to recover West\r\n\r\nIrian,   the   Member   for  Queenstown   appealed\r\n\r\nexcitedly  in  this House to the  people  to  help\r\n\r\nIndonesia recover West Irian. They encouraged  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  die but they themselves hid  in  their\r\n\r\nshelters. In the same way, when they say that when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysia comes and it is not in their interests and  is\r\n\r\ndetrimental to them, they will struggle against  it  to\r\n\r\nthe  end. I have been associated with them for quite  a\r\n\r\nlong  time and I know what they are. In 1957  we  split\r\n\r\nwith  such  adventurists. The P.A.P. had to split  with\r\n\r\nsuch  adventurists.  At  that time,  when  events  were\r\n\r\ntaking  place  they were still in the P.A.P.  They  had\r\n\r\nsworn  they would see the Party through thick and thin.\r\n\r\nBut  when  events came to pass, they  were  not  to  be\r\n\r\nfound. The Member for Upper Serangoon also could not be\r\n\r\nfound. He knew at that time what the objectives of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. were. He also said the P.A.P. is a  democratic,\r\n\r\nsocialist, non-Communist Party. And if he were to hide\r\n\r\nin  the Party he would not be in physical danger. So we\r\n\r\ncan  see what they are. But, however they may smear  to\r\n\r\nthe  effect  that merger and Malaysia are  a  sell-out,\r\n\r\ntoday   the   facts  show  that  they  will  eventually\r\n\r\nmaterialise and cannot be blocked by any means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

They have agitated many supporters  and  have\r\n\r\neven  tried to convene a Joint Action Council to  block\r\n\r\nour  merger  plan. Although they have been  criticising\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s  merger plan in unison, they  are  having\r\n\r\ndifferent dreams though lying on the same bed. When the\r\n\r\ntime  comes,  they will part company among  themselves.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  I  say now and here that  I  oppose  the\r\n\r\namendment by the Member for Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang) (In Mandarin): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, our colleague, the Member  for  Thomson,\r\n\r\nhas  moved this amendment which actually has  been  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis stand on merger and a basic contention\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis on merger as well, that is  to\r\n\r\nsay,  our  view on the reunification between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the Federation has all along been the same. If the\r\n\r\nMember for Delta wants me to make a reply, I will do so\r\n\r\nlater  on.

Therefore, we believed that what  had  been\r\n\r\nsaid  by  the  Government all along would be  put  into\r\n\r\npractice.  We  are especially of the opinion  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should include the stand of the  Opposition\r\n\r\non  merger  as a question to be put to the  people  for\r\n\r\ntheir  choice.  That  is why the Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nhimself  has  brought up his own idea of an alternative\r\n\r\nof the mode of merger, that is, whether we can join the\r\n\r\nFederation  on terms no less favourable than  those  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Borneo territories enter the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. Since the Government can accept the proposal of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Cairnhill, we believe the Government has\r\n\r\nno  reason  whatsoever  to reject  the  motion  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  In other words,  by  accepting  our\r\n\r\namendment the Government can carry out its own promise,\r\n\r\nthat is, to pose several questions for the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  people; and among these questions there is one  of\r\n\r\nthe  mode and manner of the P.A.P. Government,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe   White   Paper;  there  is  another - the  so-called\r\n\r\nunconditional and complete merger, which  is  anti  and\r\n\r\nhollow;  the third one is the amendment of  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill; and the fourth one can well be the stand\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis on merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our connection on merger, which is\r\n\r\nto have a true reunification between Singapore and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation, has been made because of the rights of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  people, that is to  say,  that  on\r\n\r\nmerger  Singapore  citizens  should  automatically\r\n\r\nbecome  Federal  citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the Government\r\n\r\nwant  to  prove  that  they are  democratic,  they\r\n\r\nshould take heed of the people's opinions. In  the\r\n\r\nfirst place, they should keep their promise,  that\r\n\r\nis to say, they must accept our motion so that the\r\n\r\ntrue  stand of the Barisan Sosialis can be put  as\r\n\r\none  of the alternatives in the referendum to  the\r\n\r\npeople for their consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Members of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  said  in  this  House  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  stand  on  merger is correct  and  is  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with  the  interests and  wishes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. But apart from admitting this\r\n\r\npublicly,  they  ask us whether we  agree  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  policies on education and labour  when\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens automatically  become  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens on Merger Day. We know that when there is\r\n\r\ntrue  merger between Singapore and the Federation,\r\n\r\nit  goes  without saying that labour and education\r\n\r\nwill  be controlled by the Central Government, it\r\n\r\ndoes   not  mean,  however,  that  if  we   obtain\r\n\r\nautomatic  citizenship rights, we will accept  the\r\n\r\npresent  policies of the Federation Government  on\r\n\r\neducation and labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we feel that the questions they\r\n\r\nwant to pose are very naive, that is to say, as  a\r\n\r\nFederal  citizen, it does not mean  that  he  must\r\n\r\nalways accept the policies on labour and education\r\n\r\nwhich are unsatisfactory to the people. Let me ask\r\n\r\nthese  naive people in the Government Party  this.\r\n\r\nIf  a  Federal  citizen is dissatisfied  with  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of  the Federal Government, what  action\r\n\r\ncan  this particular citizen take to make a change\r\n\r\nin  those policies? Mr Speaker. Sir, I would  say\r\n\r\nthat  when  a  citizen  is dissatisfied  with  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of the Government, the only way  he  can\r\n\r\nseek  remedial  action is through  the  democratic\r\n\r\nprocess,  which  is the one man  one  vote  system\r\n\r\nunder which the term of a government is limited by\r\n\r\ntime. So if the policy of any government is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory to the majority of the people, they\r\n\r\ncan  organise their own Party, or when they  think\r\n\r\nfit  they  can  join those political Parties  with\r\n\r\nwhose  principles  and policies they  agree.  Then\r\n\r\nthey  can  pass  a  vote of no confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If  they succeed in  this,  they  can\r\n\r\nelect a new government which has the confidence of\r\n\r\nthe  people and then this government that has been\r\n\r\nnewly  elected can make the necessary  changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  policies  which  are  unsatisfactory  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nfeel  that  if  there is to be any genuine  merger\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and the  Federation,  all  the\r\n\r\nprogressive  and socialist Parties  in  these  two\r\n\r\nterritories must first be united, and according to\r\n\r\nthe  principles of the Barisan Sosialis,  we  must\r\n\r\ncarry  out social reforms in our country  so  that\r\n\r\nevery member of our society will get a fair deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member has made his\r\n\r\npoint.  We do not want a debate on that aspect  of\r\n\r\nit. Let us come back to the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tee Kim Leng (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  was just trying to reply to the  question\r\n\r\nraised  by  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education  as  to  whether  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  accept  the Federation  Government's\r\n\r\npolicies on labour and education. I will say  here\r\n\r\nthat  we are unhappy with the present policies  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government on labour and education.\r\n\r\nWe  are also unhappy with the present Government's\r\n\r\npolicy on external affairs. So when the day  comes\r\n\r\nwhen  there  is true merger between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation,  the socialist Parties  must  get\r\n\r\ntogether  to  make the necessary  changes  to  the\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\ntouch  on the question of automatic conversion  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  they always say that the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not allow Singapore  citizens  to\r\n\r\nbecome Federal citizens automatically, because the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws  in  the  Federation  are   more\r\n\r\nstringent  than  those  in  Singapore.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  at  a  forum held in the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore also said that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  than  300,000  non-local  born  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  easily obtained citizenship  rights  in\r\n\r\n1957 by reason of the length of their residence in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That was why the Federation Government\r\n\r\nsaid  that the 300,000-odd non-local born citizens\r\n\r\nwere not worthy enough to become Federal citizens.\r\n\r\nOur  Prime  Minister says that if the  600,000-odd\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore  want  to  become  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens automatically on merger day, then he says\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis can get their friends in the\r\n\r\nFederation, namely, the Socialist Front, to move a\r\n\r\nmotion  in  the  Central  Parliament  asking   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government to give citizenship  rights\r\n\r\nto   the   600,000-odd  Singapore  citizens.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the P.A.P. leaders have  said  all\r\n\r\nthis,  which makes me very doubtful. It  looks  as\r\n\r\nthough their argument boils down to this; that  in\r\n\r\n1959 they were elected by the Federal citizens  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. But these are not the facts.  The\r\n\r\npresent  Government of the P.A.P. was  elected  by\r\n\r\nthe  citizens of Singapore. How strange it is that\r\n\r\non  the  side of the P.A.P. they should speak  for\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government! How strange it is that\r\n\r\nthey  have  forgotten entirely about the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  citizens of Singapore! And they have  the\r\n\r\naudacity to say that the citizens of Singapore are\r\n\r\nnot  qualified  to  become Federal  citizens!  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I believe that when the time  comes\r\n\r\nthe  people  over  there will be thrown  into  the\r\n\r\ndustbin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing which is very strange.\r\n\r\nThey  say  they  are  making  sacrifices  in   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people of Singapore. They try  to\r\n\r\nmake  their  positions safe  by  saying  they  are\r\n\r\nworking   in  the  interests  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few moments ago the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  made a speech about automatic conversion  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship.   He   made   quotations   from   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of the Federation and  he  mentioned\r\n\r\nsection 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member must modulate his\r\n\r\nvoice. It is coming through very loudly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tee Kim Leng (In Mandarin): He quoted\r\n\r\nsections  14  and  22. He said that  according  to\r\n\r\nsection   22,   the  citizens  of  Singapore   are\r\n\r\nqualified  to  become  Federal  citizens  provided\r\n\r\nthere  have been political negotiations. It  is  a\r\n\r\nfact; it is true; we know that Singapore has  been\r\n\r\nseparated  from Malaya for many years.  When  each\r\n\r\nhas  been  carrying  on its  own,  there  will  be\r\n\r\ndifferent sets of laws, and the only way  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens Federation citizens is to  have\r\n\r\nmutual negotiations between the Governments of the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories concerned. So we can see from his\r\n\r\nargument that our amendment is very reasonable and\r\n\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, he also said that the question\r\n\r\nof  true  and genuine merger was entirely  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the Federation Government. It  was,  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  because the Federation Government  did  not\r\n\r\nwant us to have a true and genuine merger with the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Well,  does it  mean  that  when  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government does not want  to  give  us\r\n\r\ngenuine merger, we must accept any type of  merger\r\n\r\nother  than  the  genuine type of  merger?  In  my\r\n\r\nopinion, I will say that in the interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, we must  try  our  best  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard such interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Delta also said that on the 15th of September, 1961, we at our\r\n\r\ninaugural  meeting  made  a  declaration  that  we\r\n\r\nwanted the Penang and Malacca type of merger. That\r\n\r\nwas  what  she  said. I believe she has  not  paid\r\n\r\nsufficient  attention to the  declaration  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis. On the 28th of August, 1961,  we\r\n\r\nin  the  Barisan  Sosialis made  public  a  policy\r\n\r\nstatement entitled \"Our stand on merger\".  I  have\r\n\r\nmade   some   quotations  from   this   particular\r\n\r\nstatement, but I do not wish to repeat them. So  I\r\n\r\nwill  say  that  if  the  Government  Benches  are\r\n\r\nsincere, they should not distort the contention of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis. Instead they must pay closer\r\n\r\nattention  to  statements  made  by  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta also said\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  trying to promise people  something\r\n\r\nbetter  than the moon, but I will say she  is  not\r\n\r\ntalking from facts. Here even the S.P.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso agrees that the White Paper is not actually a\r\n\r\ntrue  form of merger. Here we make our stand  that\r\n\r\nwe  must have automatic conversion of citizenship.\r\n\r\nSo  I  hope  and believe that the Government  will\r\n\r\ncarry  out its promises by accepting our stand  on\r\n\r\nmerger  and  posing it in the national  referendum\r\n\r\nfor the selection of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, originally I do not want  to  waste\r\n\r\nthe  time  of  the  House, but under  the  present\r\n\r\ncircumstances, when the P.A.P. is trying  to  sell\r\n\r\nout  the people of Singapore, my conscience pricks\r\n\r\nme and I feel that I have to stand up and speak  a\r\n\r\nfew words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past few months if you had gone to\r\n\r\ncoffee shops or street corners and not remained in\r\n\r\nyour  house you would have been able to  hear  the\r\n\r\ngrievances   of  the  people.

Let  me\r\n\r\nquote  a  speech made by the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nwhich appeared in page 5 of the Nanyang Siang Pau.\r\n\r\nHe  remarked, \"After merger under the White Paper,\r\n\r\nthe   citizens  of  Singapore,  however,  did  not\r\n\r\nproduce  facts  to substantiate the  benefits  and\r\n\r\nadvantages  of  the citizens of Singapore.

She  has\r\n\r\nasked,  how  long should we wait? Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nsince  the  two territories have been divided  for  so\r\n\r\nmany  years and if we can wait patiently for  so  many\r\n\r\nyears,  there  is no reason why we cannot  wait  until\r\n\r\nsuch time when we can get more favourable terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Mountbatten brought out an\r\n\r\nanalogy  of  a man seeking a post as general  manager.\r\n\r\nShe  said  that  if you are applying  for  a  post  of\r\n\r\ngeneral  manager and if you are not selected  for  it,\r\n\r\nand  the  boss  asks  you if you would  condescend  to\r\n\r\nbecome  the  assistant manager, you  cannot  say  that\r\n\r\nsince  you cannot get the post of general manager  you\r\n\r\nwill  refuse  or reject the offer. But  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nmerger  of Singapore with Malaya has a lot to do  with\r\n\r\nthe  generations to come of Singapore. Merger is  just\r\n\r\nlike  a  marriage. It can be said in this way. We  can\r\n\r\ngive  an  example. For instance, if a person  is  old,\r\n\r\nthin and tall, you have the option to choose. You  can\r\n\r\nsay  that since he is old, thin and tall, I refuse  to\r\n\r\nmarry  him. You can say you are willing to wait  until\r\n\r\nyou  find a suitable partner and then you both can get\r\n\r\nmarried.  When you get a more suitable  one,  you  can\r\n\r\nreject the old skinny one. In the same way, we can say\r\n\r\nthat  we can choose when the right time comes for  the\r\n\r\nmerger.

This  question   of\r\n\r\nautomatic citizenship for Singapore citizens to become\r\n\r\nFederal citizens was revealed during the debate on the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper on merger last year in November.

I quote, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...after our frank and thorough discussions of all\r\n\r\nthe implications involving Singapore citizenship and  merger,  I  have  agreed that  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  should  keep their  present  rights  and\r\n\r\nautomatically   become  nationals   of   the   new\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently it is felt that representation in\r\n\r\nthe  new Federation Parliament should not be based\r\n\r\non  the  total  number  of  such  citizens,  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of whom would be dis-enfranchised  if  the\r\n\r\nFederation  citizenship  and  representation  laws\r\n\r\nwere  applied.

As  an  Opposition  that  is\r\n\r\nsandwiched  in  between, we have  been  forced  to\r\n\r\nlisten to words of wisdom from the Government  side  and from the  Members  who  sit\r\n\r\nbehind us and we have come to the conclusion  that\r\n\r\nboth   are   dishonest.  They  are  indulging   in\r\n\r\ndishonest  manoeuvres, and I pass  this  judgment.\r\n\r\nBoth  have  graduated from the  same  school  of\r\n\r\ndistortion  and  both are practising  it  to  the\r\n\r\nfull.

First  and  foremost,  he  was  immediately\r\n\r\nattacked by the Member for Anson. What is all this\r\n\r\ntalk  about?  Of course, he openly says  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin is an honest man, and I openly\r\n\r\nsay  that  the Member for Anson is an  honest  man\r\n\r\ntoo. He says, \"How can he say that the door to the\r\n\r\namendment is closed?

So\r\n\r\nhere is an opportunity for the Barisan to go  and\r\n\r\npreach  that line - why should Singapore be offered\r\n\r\nless  than  the Bornean territories - and  persuade\r\n\r\nthe electorate to accept terms no less favourable\r\n\r\nthan those offered to the Borneo territories.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, in order to know what the terms are, they\r\n\r\nwill have to await the publication of the Cobbold\r\n\r\nReport.

But  I  am trying to explain the\r\n\r\ndigs of the Member for Anson. But I will leave it \r\n\r\nat that. All  that I  would like to say is this: \r\n\r\nthe Member  for Anson  is  at least honest in his  desire  to\r\n\r\nwant   this  question  posed.  But  in   this Assembly, not only\r\n\r\njust  now but on previous occasions,  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid   that  what  he  wants  are  automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights. But he is  prepared  to\r\n\r\ntell the people, \"Not only will you have  the\r\n\r\nrights  but  you, the people,  will  have  to\r\n\r\naccept  the  limitations imposed  under  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\"    That    is    an     honest\r\n\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at the Barisan Sosialis. They keep\r\n\r\non  talking about citizenship rights and  not\r\n\r\nwanting  to  say anything else.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are just playing on the emotions  of\r\n\r\nthe masses. It is easy to tell them, \"second-class  citizens\" and get them  so  roused  up\r\n\r\nthat  they will vote against Paper  Cmd.  33.\r\n\r\nIs   there   such  a  thing  as  second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship  in Paper Cmd. 33?  I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthere   is   no   clarity  because   of   the\r\n\r\ndistortions  practised by the Government  and\r\n\r\nby the Barisan  Sosialis. If there had been an  honest\r\n\r\npresentation,  there  would  have   been   no\r\n\r\nconfusion  in  the minds of the people.  What\r\n\r\nhas   been  agreed  upon  is  that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens   cannot  participate  in   Federal\r\n\r\nelections   and   Federal   citizens   cannot\r\n\r\nparticipate in Singapore elections.  That  is\r\n\r\nall.  Federal  nationality is brought  in  to\r\n\r\ngive  us  all  equal status. And  as  Federal\r\n\r\nnationals  we  can  go to the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  at any time and do anything we  want,\r\n\r\nother  than stand as candidates for  election\r\n\r\nor vote in the Federation of Malaya. The Barisan  Sosialis seem to be very keen on wanting\r\n\r\nto   stand  as  candidates  in  the   Federal\r\n\r\nParliament  and  to vote in  the  Federation.\r\n\r\nThey  overlook the fact that what  is  denied\r\n\r\nto  us  is  also  denied  to  the  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizens. Let us get it straight. Forget  all\r\n\r\ndistortions; forget all attempts to run  down\r\n\r\nthe  other Party. Singapore citizens can only\r\n\r\nparticipate   in  elections  in   Singapore;\r\n\r\nFederation citizens can only participate  in\r\n\r\nelections in the Federation. Apart from  that\r\n\r\nwe     are     all    known    as     Federal\r\n\r\nnationals - wherever we go, whatever we do,  we\r\n\r\nare equal. Do not start talking of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecond-class citizenship and play on the  emotions\r\n\r\nof the people. Because they have been playing that\r\n\r\nline  and  because the P.A.P. has been  trying  to\r\n\r\nplay that line - oh, the Penang and Malacca type  of\r\n\r\nmerger  means  non-local born citizens  will  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  citizenship  rights - therefore,  this  line\r\n\r\nabout    citizenship   has    been    played    up\r\n\r\nunnecessarily,  so  much  so  that   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, by their amendment, are trying  to  play\r\n\r\non  this line of automatic citizenship rights  for\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference? The difference, in what\r\n\r\nthey  want,  is that Barisan Sosialis members  can\r\n\r\nstand  for Federal elections and they can go there\r\n\r\nand  vote in the Federal elections. That  is  all.\r\n\r\nBut  in  exchange for that, what have we to  gain?\r\n\r\nComplete control over Singapore affairs. Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  become  just a State like any State  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. And what do we get? Nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, we all know that in the present\r\n\r\nsituation  and the political temper of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, they cannot, even if they want  to,\r\n\r\naccept  with  a  happy  countenance  some  of  the\r\n\r\npolicies  of  the  Federation Government.  And  so\r\n\r\nbecause   Singapore   comes   into   this   closer\r\n\r\nassociation  and has certain powers  reserved  to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, that is why there cannot  be\r\n\r\ncomplete and unconditional merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said last night that we were prepared to\r\n\r\nlisten to the proposition of the Barisan. This  is\r\n\r\nwhat  I said - at page 74 of the transcript, at  the\r\n\r\nbottom of that page [Vol. 19, No. 2, col. 250]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...that the questions to be posed should be\r\n\r\nquestions  that  are  easily  understood  by   the\r\n\r\nelectorate  and that the proposal  should  be  one\r\n\r\nthat has some known form. It would be wrong if the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis were to put up a  proposal  that\r\n\r\nbears  no relation to facts. It would be wrong  if\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis want to put  a  proposal  in\r\n\r\norder  to  appeal to the emotions  of  the  public\r\n\r\ninstead  of putting up a proposal that would  best\r\n\r\nserve  the  interests of the public. And  what  is\r\n\r\nmore  important is that whatever proposal  we  put\r\n\r\nforward  to the electorate for their decision,  it\r\n\r\nmust  be  one  that  can  be  acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Because of the exchange of correspondence between\r\n\r\nthe  two  Prime Ministers, they know that at  this\r\n\r\npresent  juncture  automatic  citizenship  is  not\r\n\r\nacceptable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n                 \r\n\r\nto  the  Federation. But they want to  demand  it.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the motive behind this demand. It is  not\r\n\r\nto  show that they are brave men, not to show that\r\n\r\nthey   have   the  interests  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore at heart. But it is to do their best to\r\n\r\ndamage  merger. Then they say, surely if we cannot\r\n\r\nget what we want, we can wait. But, Sir, the trend\r\n\r\nof   political   events  is  that  countries   are\r\n\r\nswallowed into it, and much as we want to wait, we\r\n\r\ncannot wait. Three years ago when the PAP, came to\r\n\r\npower,   everytime  they  talked  of  merger   the\r\n\r\nFederation said, \"No\"; - because in the midst of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., in the Government, in the Party,  and\r\n\r\nin  the - political machinery of the P,A.P.,  there\r\n\r\nwere  Communists and Communist front  people.  Now\r\n\r\nthey  have  purged themselves and, therefore,  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government thought it would be  a  good\r\n\r\nthing  that  instead of a complete merger  perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  could  try with a sort of closer association\r\n\r\nwhere  both  sides  have  to  be  on  their   best\r\n\r\nbehaviour - Singapore  has  to  be  on   its   best\r\n\r\nbehaviour   in  order  to  qualify  for  conplete\r\n\r\nmerger,  and the Federation has to be on its  best\r\n\r\nbehaviour in order to make Singapore feel that  it\r\n\r\nis beneficial to go in for complete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this form of closer association that has\r\n\r\nbeen offered to us by the Federation  of  Malaya, \r\n\r\nby Tunku Abdul  Rahman,  in spite  of  his  previous\r\n\r\nanimosity  and  fear  of having  anything  to  do \r\n\r\nwith Singapore - must  that offer of friendship - be \r\n\r\nrejected, just cast aside, and we say, \"No, we want \r\n\r\nthe whole lot or none  at all.\"? Of course, Sir, my \r\n\r\ncolleague the Member for Tanglin  has said that we \r\n\r\nmight want to  buy, but the seller might not want\r\n\r\nto sell. So it has been suggested by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  and by Barisan Sosialis Members, who  always\r\n\r\necho the views of the Member for Anson --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Their leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Never!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- if we cannot have it, let\r\n\r\nus  wait.

And he knows that the people  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya cannot at the  present  stage\r\n\r\naccept  automatic  citizenship.  Then  why  is   he\r\n\r\npushing it? Why are the Banisan pushing a case  that\r\n\r\nthey  know  is  not acceptable? It is  leading  the\r\n\r\npeople  more and more to the conclusion, as  it  has\r\n\r\nled  us, that they are out to damage merger and  not\r\n\r\nto have merger.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that the people should not be\r\n\r\ncompelled - the Member for Thomson has said that  his\r\n\r\namendment is the stand of the Barisan Sosialis. Sir,\r\n\r\never  since the Barisan Sosialis came into being,  I\r\n\r\nhave  read  and  I have heard in this Assembly  that\r\n\r\nthere  seem  to be three stands. One is merger  like\r\n\r\nPenang and Malacca, another is that Indonesia is the\r\n\r\nheartland  of  Malaysia, and still another  is,  why\r\n\r\nshould  Singapore get less than what is offered  to\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo territories? And now they come out with:\r\n\r\nThis is our stand. Well, if that is their stand, let\r\n\r\nthose who love the country, those who will fight and\r\n\r\ndie  for  the interests of the country,  resist  any\r\n\r\nattempt  by  the Barisan Sosialis to  damage\r\n\r\nthe interests of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Upper Serangoon, because\r\n\r\nof the illustration given by my colleague, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin, about doors,  tried  to\r\n\r\nread  into his speech that he did not deny that  the\r\n\r\ndoor to amendment (d) is a door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n             \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

That\r\n\r\ndoor is the P.P.S.O. The sooner that door  is\r\n\r\nopened,  the  better  it  will  be   to   rid\r\n\r\nSingapore  of  this threat  from  Commumists\r\n\r\nand  Communist front leaders. Open that door.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Upper Serangoon can call it  a\r\n\r\ndark door or any door.

I  find it  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nunderstand what he was trying to say. He  was\r\n\r\ntalking  about citizenship. He was trying  to\r\n\r\ntalk  about citizenship again. How  can  they\r\n\r\nkeep     playing    that    line - second-class\r\n\r\ncitizenship?  There  is  no  such  thing  as\r\n\r\nsecond-class  citizenship. I am  sorry,  Sir,\r\n\r\nto  have  taken too much time.

There   are    three\r\n\r\nalternatives  before us.  One  is  merger  as\r\n\r\ncontained  in  the White Paper under  Command\r\n\r\nPaper  33.  The  second  alternative   is   a\r\n\r\ncomplete and unconditional merger. The  third\r\n\r\nalternative is (c), that is, on  terms  like\r\n\r\nthose  of  the  Borneo territories.  After  a\r\n\r\nlong  debate on the Government's White  Paper\r\n\r\non  merger, the Government has never  changed\r\n\r\nits  stand. It is clear that the stand of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is firm. On the issue of  merger,\r\n\r\nthey  have recognised the objective fact  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   They   have   ignored   the\r\n\r\nobjective --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang): On a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam (In Mandarin):\r\n\r\nJust now the Parliamentary Secretary said that the\r\n\r\nthird  alternative is a Barisan Sosialis type  of\r\n\r\nmerger.

I  can\r\n\r\nquote  a number of expressions to show what  their\r\n\r\nmerger  means.  Their merger is  complete  merger\r\n\r\nplus  the  moon,  the sun, the  stars.  They  want\r\n\r\nautomatic  conversion  of citizenship.  They  want\r\n\r\nimmediate general elections in the Federation,  so\r\n\r\nthat they can topple the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members of the Barisan Sosialis have failed\r\n\r\nto  recognise the practical circumstances  of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories. They hope that if they make more\r\n\r\npromises,  they  can get more  support  from  the\r\n\r\npeople.  They  have  undergone  many  changes.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  this morning that our  Party  Chairman\r\n\r\nhas  clearly pointed out that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nstand changes occasionally. They maintain that  if\r\n\r\nthey  change  their objective from time  to  time,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  able to get more and more  support\r\n\r\nfrom the people. Let us ask the people of the two\r\n\r\nterritories  what they are short  of.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger can fulfil the wishes of the people of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories.  The people of  Malaya  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore consist or  many  races.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore the Chinese are in the majority,  while\r\n\r\nin Malaya the Malays are in the majority. After  a\r\n\r\nseparation  of  so  many  years,  there  is   some\r\n\r\ndifference between the mode of life of the  people\r\n\r\nof  the two territories. But, on the whole, it  is\r\n\r\nquite the same. Let us speak of the differences in\r\n\r\nthe   field  of  education  and  labour.  If   any\r\n\r\npolitical  Party  can  put forward  some  plan  to\r\n\r\nincorporate the differences in the two territories\r\n\r\nin the field of education and labour, then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  or  less they can eliminate the  differences\r\n\r\nand work out a more satisfactory merger plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember this phrase: Sink differenes and\r\n\r\nfind  out  some common points. Then and only  then\r\n\r\nwill  merger  be  easier. I  am  sure,  under  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  their type of  merger  cannot  be\r\n\r\nimplemented. Everybody is aware that their type of\r\n\r\nmerger  is  not practical. Their actions  are  not\r\n\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know the Barisan Sosialis and the stooges of the Communists are bound to use\r\n\r\nall  forms of intimidation to change the stand  of\r\n\r\nother  people. However, they cannot easily  change\r\n\r\nthe stand of the P.A.P. Since the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper on merger up till now,  we  have\r\n\r\nnever  changed our stand. Why? This is  a  strange\r\n\r\nquestion, Mr Speaker. I feel this is a matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple. The P.A.P. principle is quite different\r\n\r\nfrom the principle of the Barisan Sosialis. One is\r\n\r\nbased  on the Malayan context, while the other  is\r\n\r\nto  suit the united front policy to achieve  their\r\n\r\nown ends. That is what I said. The two fundamental\r\n\r\nstands are quite different.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The stand of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  is quite different  from  ours.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why I have to point it out particularly.\r\n\r\nIn  our  platform  there is stated non-Communist.\r\n\r\nBut  in the platform of the Barisan Sosialis there\r\n\r\nis  no such word as \"non-Communist'. That exposes\r\n\r\ntheir ugly side.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of merger, just because we are non-Communists, that makes the difference\r\n\r\nbetween us --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member come\r\n\r\nback to the amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nDuring  the debate today, the Opposition  Parties\r\n\r\nhave been saying that they are serving the people.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why they are making a noise  here in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the people. How can they  serve\r\n\r\nthe interest  of  the people?  In  my  opinion.\r\n\r\ntheir  type  of merger is to create more  conflict\r\n\r\nbetween the various races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the one man representative of the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party has sought to make himself out  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  very  extraordinary  lawyer,  a  wonderful\r\n\r\nlawyer.  The  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture has said that he has a very\r\n\r\nbad temper. That spils everything. His policy  is\r\n\r\na  policy  of  \"tailism\".  They  are  toeing  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis line. They are just  like  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  stooges living  the  life  of\r\n\r\npeople who are being the line of others. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  if the people  of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaya  today  listen  to the  \"tailism\"  of  such\r\n\r\nleaders, it will be very unfortunate for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam (In Mandarin):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I hope that I can answer in four\r\n\r\nminutes all the unreasonable accusations from the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side. The Member for Delta  asked  us\r\n\r\nwhy we want to seek citizenship rights for 624,000\r\n\r\ncitizens. My answer is that the citizenship rights\r\n\r\nof   these   624,000  citizens  are  their   basic\r\n\r\ndemocratic rights which should not be thwarted in\r\n\r\nany  way.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  just now the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill said that if full merger could  not\r\n\r\nbe secured, then half merger would be quite good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  said  that  if we could not get  all  that  we\r\n\r\nwanted to buy, then why not accept half of it?  In\r\n\r\nmy opinion, the White Paper merger proposal is not\r\n\r\njust one half of something that we want, but it is\r\n\r\npoison,  and that is why the people cannot  accept\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nasked that   apart  from  the  Barisan  Sosialis  merger\r\n\r\nproposals which provide for automatic citizenship,\r\n\r\nwhat  else could the people of Singapore  get?  If\r\n\r\nthe  question  is  as simple  as  that,  then  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government has  no  right  at  all  to\r\n\r\nreject  the request that all citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nshould   automatically  become  citizens  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  short\r\n\r\nspeech  of  the  Member  for  Cairnhill,  we  can\r\n\r\nclearly see that he has\r\n\r\nentirely  changed his stand.  I  quote  from  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  Siang Pau of 4th July, 1962.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill  said  that all  political  Parties\r\n\r\nshould  discard  all  party differences  and  seek\r\n\r\nunity  among  themselves in  order  to  promote  a\r\n\r\ncloser relationship between Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation. No matter what the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  or  the Workers' Party merger  proposals\r\n\r\nare, we should let the people decide on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday we only debated the\r\n\r\nthree   alternatives.  Now,  our   amendment   was\r\n\r\nrejected by the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the S.P.A. The fourth alternative\r\n\r\nintroduced  by the Member for Thomson is  in  line\r\n\r\nwith  what the Member for Cairnhill has said, that\r\n\r\nthere  should be adequate questions for the people\r\n\r\nto  choose  from. However, you can  see  that  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill is not interested in looking\r\n\r\nafter  the  interests of the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut after the interests of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question, as amended,\r\n\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House resolves that the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore be asked to express their choice\r\n\r\non the mode and manner of the inevitable\r\n\r\nreunification of the two territories and that\r\n\r\na referendum be held for the people to\r\n\r\ndecide between the alternatives of reunification on the basis of\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the constitutional arrangements set out in\r\n\r\nPaper  Command  33  of 1961 giving  Singapore\r\n\r\nautonomy in education and labour; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a complete and unconditional merger as a\r\n\r\nstate  on  an  equal  basis  with  the  other\r\n\r\neleven   states  in  accordance   with   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  documents of the  Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to enter Malaysia on terms no less\r\n\r\nfavourable  than  the terms  for  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Since which an amendment has been moved,\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"at end, to add `or\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) genuine merger of Singapore with the\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya,   with    Singapore\r\n\r\nentering the Federation as the twelfth  state\r\n\r\nand   with  all  its  Citizens  automatically\r\n\r\nbecoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day'.\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nadded, be there added.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 17; Noes, 29;\r\n\r\nAbstention, Nil;  Absent, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Ayes.

We  have\r\n\r\nbefore the people allegedly three questions for a\r\n\r\nreferendum, when, in fact, there is but one, and\r\n\r\nthat is not a question, Sir, because you are  not\r\n\r\nallowed to give an answer yes or no. There is  no\r\n\r\nchoice of answer. You must say yes and therefore\r\n\r\nthere  is this position that we are now allegedly\r\n\r\ngiving  the people a referendum, when, in  fact,\r\n\r\nall  they  can do is say yes to the one proposal,\r\n\r\nCommand Paper 33. I have but two minutes, Sir.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown to you that proposal (b) is the\r\n\r\none which the Prime Minister suggests is mine. We\r\n\r\nhave  put our stand very clearly in the amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have  now  just  defeated.  Sir,  he\r\n\r\nsuggests  that we can put it to a Commission  of\r\n\r\nJurists  or  Judges.  If  he  can  assure  us  or\r\n\r\nobtain - not he, I am not interested in the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncorkscrew  assurances - or  if  we  can   have   an\r\n\r\nassurance  from  the  Prime  Minister   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation that he would be content to  give  us\r\n\r\nwhat a legal commission would consider to be  the\r\n\r\ntrue  meaning of that proposal, I would be  happy\r\n\r\nto  accept  it.
