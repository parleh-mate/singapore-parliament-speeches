The Lim Chu Kang\r\n\r\nDistrict  Veterinary Station was planned in 1954  and\r\n\r\ncommenced   operations  the   following   year.   The\r\n\r\nextension  work  done  from this  station  is  highly\r\n\r\nsuccessful  and  during the last 18 months  over  500\r\n\r\nstud  animals  and 1,000 poultry have been  bred  and\r\n\r\ndistributed  to  farmers and co-operative  societies.\r\n\r\nThere is a long waiting list for such assistance. The\r\n\r\npedigree  stock  at  Lim Chu Kang  include  pigs  and\r\n\r\npoultry presented by the Commonwealth and  Australia under  the  Colombo Plan. Nearly 1,500,000  pigs  and\r\n\r\npoultry  have  been given protective vaccinations  by\r\n\r\nthe  team  operating from Lim Chu Kang  so  far  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim Chu Kang is used to produce improved stock but\r\n\r\nthe  normal  research work planned for Sembawang  has\r\n\r\nbeen  increased as far as facilities allow since  Dr\r\n\r\nKelly  arrived in Singapore in December. The research\r\n\r\nwork  is  conducted amongst pigs, poultry and  cattle\r\n\r\nand  the  work  now in progress involves establishing\r\n\r\nparental strains from which controlled breeding  work\r\n\r\nwill  evolve.  Eighteen strains  of  pigs  have  been\r\n\r\nselected  and  the  progeny which  will  perform  the\r\n\r\nparental strain are now coming forward and from these\r\n\r\nthe  first  generation  of developed  stock  will  be\r\n\r\nproduced.  One thousand two hundred poultry  are  now\r\n\r\ngrowing  under  trap-nest conditions  and  the  first\r\n\r\nparental  strains will be selected from these  birds.\r\n\r\nTheir  progeny will not be ready until March  because\r\n\r\nthere is no room at Lim Chu Kang to develop this work\r\n\r\nfurther.  Special poultry extension work  is  planned\r\n\r\nfor the central station at Sembawang.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 40 cows and four bulls from Pakistan at\r\n\r\nLim  Chu  Kang  and the first progeny are  now  being\r\n\r\nproduced.

This is the  more  remarkable\r\n\r\nbecause four years ago the Lim Chu Kang area was  the\r\n\r\nmost   poorly   developed  area  in   Singapore   for\r\n\r\nlivestock.

Shanks):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill  be  now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe  second clause of this Bill is designed to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  power  to  pass a sentence  of  preventive\r\n\r\ndetention,  which must by law be for a period  of  at\r\n\r\nleast     five    years,    shall    be     exercised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  by  the  High Court. As the Criminal  Procedure\r\n\r\nCode  stands at present, it is not clear  that  these\r\n\r\nsentences of preventive detention can only be imposed\r\n\r\nby  the  High  Court, although it is clear  that  the\r\n\r\nsomewhat  lesser sentence of corrective  training  is\r\n\r\none  restricted to the High Court. Clause 2 will make\r\n\r\nthe position quite clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this Bill is designed to avoid any doubt\r\n\r\nas  to the powers of courts to remand accused persons\r\n\r\nin  such  custody  as the courts  think  fit.  It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary sometimes for accused persons to  be  given\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity, in their own interests, of pointing\r\n\r\nout  individuals or places which have  a  bearing  on\r\n\r\ncases under investigation. This cannot be done if the\r\n\r\nperson  is  remanded  in  prison,  and  it  is  often\r\n\r\nundesirable,  particularly in the initial  stages  of\r\n\r\ninvestigation, that a person should be  granted  bail\r\n\r\nmerely  for the purpose of enabling him to point  out\r\n\r\nwitnesses  or places that are relevant to  the  case.\r\n\r\nThis clause will bring the Criminal Procedure Code of\r\n\r\nthe  colony into line with the provisions which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in  existence in the Federation for some  years\r\n\r\nand  have  worked well there, but with the difference\r\n\r\nthat  whereas in the Federation there is a period  of\r\n\r\n15  days during which this custody other than  prison\r\n\r\ncan  subsist,  it  is thought that in  Singapore  the\r\n\r\nordinary period of eight days should suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill is in two parts. The first part\r\n\r\nis designed to make the offences of unlawful assembly\r\n\r\nand   rioting  not  bailable  as  of  right.  It   is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that in cases of this nature, the  courts\r\n\r\nshould  have  a  discretion to  refuse  bail  if  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  so  require, and in  order  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  able to do that, it is thought  right  to\r\n\r\nmake the alterations referred to in paragraph (a)  of\r\n\r\nclause 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of this clause is designed to remove\r\n\r\nany   doubt  that  might  exist  regarding  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer's  power to arrest without warrant  a  person\r\n\r\nwho  obstructs  him in the discharge of  his  duties.\r\n\r\nWhereas section 31 of the Code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite  clearly  gives  police  officers  that  power,\r\n\r\nSchedule A to the Code - in referring to section 186 of\r\n\r\nthe  Penal  Code - at  present says that  ordinarily  a\r\n\r\nwarrant  should  be  obtained  before  arrest.  Quite\r\n\r\nclearly  with  offences  of  this  nature,  immediate\r\n\r\narrest  is necessary. This amendment will remove  the\r\n\r\ndoubts that have existed in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth clause deals with the provisions of what\r\n\r\nis  elsewhere known as the Borstal system. At present\r\n\r\nSchedule D to the Criminal Procedure Code which  lays\r\n\r\ndown  the  detailed provisions regarding  reformative\r\n\r\ntraining,  as  we call it in Singapore,  allow  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  being  kept in a reformative training  centre\r\n\r\nfor  a  period of more than four years,  whereas  the\r\n\r\nnormal  practice is that a person should be  so  kept\r\n\r\nfor  only  three  years  as a  maximum  and  for  the\r\n\r\nremainder  of  the four years from the  date  of  the\r\n\r\nimposition of the sentence be under supervision. That\r\n\r\nperiod  of  release under supervision is regarded  as\r\n\r\none  of  the  very  important  parts  of  reformative\r\n\r\ntraining  and  it  is thought that the  system  would\r\n\r\nsuffer if we allowed to remain in the law this  power\r\n\r\nto  keep  a  person in detention beyond the  ordinary\r\n\r\nperiod of three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be thought that an anomaly had crept in\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Schedule was originally drafted  and  this\r\n\r\nclause  is  designed to put the matter right  and  to\r\n\r\nensure   that  every  person  who  is  sentenced   to\r\n\r\nreformative training shall have the opportunity of  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  freedom under supervision  after  he  has\r\n\r\nundergone  the  training in the reformative  training\r\n\r\ncentre itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.

The former union  of\r\n\r\nthe   Museum  and  Library  was  to  a  large  extent\r\n\r\nfortuitous  and not in the best interests  of  either\r\n\r\nonce they had begun to develop. The separation in the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the Raffles  Museum  and  Raffles\r\n\r\nLibrary took place at the beginning of the year  1955\r\n\r\nwhich in effect rendered obsolete the Raffles Society\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a simple one because the statutory\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  a display and research  museum  are\r\n\r\nvery  limited, and this Bill now brought up  for  its\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading contains only two significant  points\r\n\r\nto  which I would like to draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. One of the innovations is in clauses 3  (3)\r\n\r\nand 6 whereby the Governor may by notification in the\r\n\r\nGazette authorise any member of the staff to exercise\r\n\r\nwithin the Museum and Museum grounds the powers of  a\r\n\r\npolice  officer.  This  is an important  point  since\r\n\r\npreviously although the Director was responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe safety of the building and collections he had  no\r\n\r\ngeneral authority for preventing misdemeanour.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that hon. Members will agree that the  valuable\r\n\r\ncollections  in the Museum need protection  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  Director  should be empowered to deal  with  any\r\n\r\ncontingency that may arise.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second innovation, Sir, in this Bill is in\r\n\r\nclause 4, which gives official\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecognition to the Advisory Committee on  Art,  which\r\n\r\nwas  set up in 1953 and 1954, in anticipation of  the\r\n\r\nRaffles  Library  moving to its  own  building.  This\r\n\r\nprovision  under  clause 4 will  give  this  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee a permanent status so that in the years  to\r\n\r\ncome  we can hope that Raffles Museum will contain  a\r\n\r\ncollection  of objects illustrating the  art  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  people, the Malays and the Indians who  have\r\n\r\nby  their culture and way of life made Singapore into\r\n\r\nwhat  it  is  today. It is also hoped that  this  Art\r\n\r\nCommittee  will  in  the course of  time  assist  the\r\n\r\nDirector in building up exhibition galleries  in  the\r\n\r\nMuseum devoted to art.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Sir.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.36 a.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nspeak on one aspect of this Bill which I consider  to\r\n\r\nbe  rather  unsatisfactory and which falls  short  of\r\n\r\nwhat  I think we should aim at in legislation of this\r\n\r\nsort. I refer to clause 4 (1) and (3) (a) which reads\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) There shall be constituted an Arts Committee\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Minister comprising of persons  who\r\n\r\nare  knowledgeable  in, or have specific  information\r\n\r\non,  matters pertaining to Chinese, Indian and  Malay\r\n\r\nart.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) (a) The functions of the Arts Committee shall be\r\n\r\nto  advise  the  Director on  the  acquisition  of  a\r\n\r\ncollection  of objects illustrating particularly  the\r\n\r\narts  of China, Malays and India, in order to reflect\r\n\r\nthe  art,  culture  and way of life  of  the  various\r\n\r\ncommunities who have settled in Malaya;\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my objection is to the implied limitation of\r\n\r\nthe  arts to Chinese, Indian and Malay art. My  first\r\n\r\nreaction, I must confess, was to suggest an amendment\r\n\r\nfor  the  inclusion of European art  with  the  other\r\n\r\nthree,   thinking  on  the  lines  of   our   present\r\n\r\nmultilingualism, but my second thought was that  this\r\n\r\namendment  would  not be getting  us  away  from  the\r\n\r\nnarrow,  somewhat communal drafting of  this  clause,\r\n\r\nwhich is entirely alien to a proper artistic outlook.\r\n\r\nWe  have in sub-clause (1) of clause 4 the inclusion,\r\n\r\nfor example, of Malay art but what about Malayan art,\r\n\r\nfor it is that very fusion of the arts which we would\r\n\r\nlike  to  see  encouraged in this  country:  and  yet\r\n\r\nMalayan art finds no place in this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all it is a fact that there is already\r\n\r\ndeveloping a Singapore school - or if \"school\" is  too\r\n\r\nambitious  a  word,  a Singapore \"style\" - of  painting\r\n\r\nwhich  is  individual to this island. Cheong Soopieng\r\n\r\nis  a  Singapore artist - or a Malay - an artist  if  you\r\n\r\nprefer  it - of whom we have every reason to be  proud,\r\n\r\nand  there  are  other painters here of  considerable\r\n\r\npromise.  The work of a young man called Chiao  Hsien\r\n\r\nwas  exhibited  the  other day  which  is  distinctly\r\n\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we limit ourselves to Chinese, Indian and Malay\r\n\r\nart  in  this piece of legislation, we are  also,  by\r\n\r\nimplication,  leaving out Indonesian art,  which  has\r\n\r\nhad  a  considerable influence in  this  country,  or\r\n\r\nSiamese  art, or the art of the Philippines of  which\r\n\r\nwe  have  had  a recent exposition in Singapore.  And\r\n\r\nwhen  Singapore  could  so  easily  be,  through  its\r\n\r\nuniversities and flourishing societies, a centre  and\r\n\r\na  fountain and a blending of the art forms, it would\r\n\r\nbe  a  thousand pities not to reflect this even in  a\r\n\r\nminor  piece of legislation like this Raffles  Museum\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to see clause 4 (1) and (3)\r\n\r\n(a) amended to read as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) There shall be constituted an Arts Committee\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Minister comprising of persons  who\r\n\r\nare  knowledgeable  in, or have specific  information\r\n\r\non, matters pertaining to the arts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The functions of the Arts Committee shall be-\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to advise the Director on the acquisition of\r\n\r\na  collection of objects illustrating the arts of\r\n\r\nall  nations, in order in particular  to  reflect\r\n\r\nthe  art, culture and way of life of the  various\r\n\r\ncommunities who have settled in Malaya;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis in clause 4 (3) (a) would still be on\r\n\r\nthe  arts of the various communities who have settled\r\n\r\nin  Malaya,  as  it should be, but the impression  of\r\n\r\nexclusiveness  will  have  been  removed.  Government\r\n\r\npolicy can still direct that emphasis should be given\r\n\r\nto  Malay, Chinese or Indian art, but Indonesian art,\r\n\r\nor  European  art, or Malayan art, for  that  matter,\r\n\r\nwill also find its natural place.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government and indeed this House\r\n\r\nwill accept these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendments  which I propose to move at the  Committee\r\n\r\nstage in the spirit in which I intend them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.40 a.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, referring to\r\n\r\nthe speech made by the hon.

The\r\n\r\nadministration of the Botanic Gardens is  at  present\r\n\r\ntechnically   governed  by  the   Raffles   Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance  (Cap.  312), but this Ordinance  has  long\r\n\r\nbeen  a  dead letter in so far as the Botanic Gardens\r\n\r\nis concerned.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, together with the Raffles Museum Bill and\r\n\r\nthe  Raffles  National Library Bill which  have  just\r\n\r\nbeen  passed  in this Assembly, will jointly  replace\r\n\r\nthe  Raffles  Societies Ordinance (Cap.  312),  under\r\n\r\nwhich the Botanic Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRaffles Library and Raffles Museum are governed.  The\r\n\r\nconjunction   of  the  three  institutions   in   one\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was  artificial and it is clear  from  the\r\n\r\npreamble  to that Ordinance that the three Bills  are\r\n\r\ndesigned to enable the administration of each of  the\r\n\r\nthree institutions to be separately conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, the Bill sets out the\r\n\r\nframework  for  the  administration  of  the  Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens.

With the general purpose of  this  Bill,\r\n\r\nSir,  there will be no disagreement for it must be  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of pride to us all that our progress  towards\r\n\r\nnation-building  has reached the stage  when  we  can\r\n\r\ndiscuss  this Bill. Nations are not created from  the\r\n\r\ntop  and  then citizens fitted into the  nation.  The\r\n\r\nnation is a group of individual citizens whose  drive\r\n\r\nand  loyalty  create the feeling of nationality,  the\r\n\r\nfeeling of being a distinct and distinctive group. It\r\n\r\nis in the heart and from the heart of each individual\r\n\r\ncitizen  that grows the vital and fertile seed  of  a\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the problems of the constitution focussed\r\n\r\non our discussions in London have roused interest and\r\n\r\ndiscussion, the constitution can be no stronger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  the  dynamic of the devotion it  harnesses  and\r\n\r\nguides;  or to put it in another way: the first  step\r\n\r\nin  establishing  self-government is  to  define  the\r\n\r\n\"self\"  which will govern, and the \"self\" is the  sum\r\n\r\nof  our  citizens. This is not done in any spirit  of\r\n\r\nexclusiveness  from  others, let alone  hostility  to\r\n\r\nothers.  A  nation, like an individual, must  have  a\r\n\r\ndistinct personality but that does not stand  in  the\r\n\r\nway  of friendship. In fact, without it there can  be\r\n\r\nno friendship between national groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of a Singapore citizenship has always\r\n\r\nbeen  in the forefront of our policy. There have been\r\n\r\nlegal difficulties of definition. There has been  the\r\n\r\nneed   to   keep  in  tune  with  our  constitutional\r\n\r\ndiscussions. Even though it was not possible to us to\r\n\r\nget  the  independence of the  full  members  of  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth like our neighbour (which is closer than\r\n\r\na  neighbour),  the  Federation of  Malaya,  we  have\r\n\r\nalways  sought  to  have  the  same  status  for  our\r\n\r\ncitizenship as if we were independent. My predecessor\r\n\r\nas  Chief Minister got it as one of his chief  hopes,\r\n\r\nand  the Secretary of State for the Colonies has  not\r\n\r\nraised  political  or fundamental objection.  He  has\r\n\r\nalways  accepted  our  case  and  most  recently  and\r\n\r\nfinally, hon. Members will recollect paragraph 51  of\r\n\r\nthe  Report  of  our constitutional discussions  last\r\n\r\nApril which reads:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Her Majesty's Government propose that section 1 (3)\r\n\r\nof  the  British  Nationality Act,  1948,  should  be\r\n\r\namended  to  include  Singapore,  so  that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens would be recognised under the Act as British\r\n\r\nsubjects and Commonwealth citizens,\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons, Sir, why this is an\r\n\r\nessential step. We as elected Members of the Assembly\r\n\r\nowe  our power to our representing the views  of  the\r\n\r\npeople as expressed through the secrecy of the ballot\r\n\r\nbox.  As  individuals,  whatever  our  abilities   or\r\n\r\nclaims,  we have no power other than the power  which\r\n\r\nderives  from the people. In defining the rights  and\r\n\r\nqualifications  of  those who sent  us  here  we  are\r\n\r\ngiving   the   only  democratic  authority   to   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly of the self-governing  Singapore\r\n\r\nto speak for the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   Singapore   in  defining  policy,   in   framing\r\n\r\nlegislation, and in raising and allocating the public\r\n\r\nfunds of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, citizenship not only gives political\r\n\r\nrights  but  also responsibilities, and  it  must  be\r\n\r\nclear on whom these responsibilities fall and on whom\r\n\r\nthe  state  can  call  for  the  services  which  the\r\n\r\ncommunity requires. As therefore the citizens  create\r\n\r\nand  control  political power,  their  qualifications\r\n\r\nmust  be  clearly defined, but this is  more  than  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  legal  definition.  That  is  the   first\r\n\r\nessential step but it is not enough. The legal  forms\r\n\r\nmust  be  given  the  warmth and  vitality  of  human\r\n\r\nemotions,  but there can be none of the  associations\r\n\r\nof a homeland, of belonging to Singapore, until there\r\n\r\nis  a  clear definition of those who are at  home  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And  it is equally clear that  those  who\r\n\r\nbecome  our citizens and make this their home  should\r\n\r\ndeclare their clear loyalty to Singapore. It  is  for\r\n\r\nthat reason that the Bill requires an oath of loyalty\r\n\r\nand, in certain cases, an oath of renunciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a state of peoples of many races and\r\n\r\ncultures,  and  as  a  commercial  port  our  windows\r\n\r\nare - and must always, be - open to all quarters  of  the\r\n\r\nglobe.  In  this lies our richness and our  vitality,\r\n\r\nbut  it also means that our loyalties must be all the\r\n\r\nstronger, not to be overwhelmed by the many pulls  on\r\n\r\nus  from  cultures  older and nations  stronger  than\r\n\r\nourselves.  We have to build up our own  personality,\r\n\r\ndrawing elements from what ever source can contribute\r\n\r\nto  us,  but it must contribute to our own integrated\r\n\r\npersonality.  We must not be an unstable  association\r\n\r\nof  outside  influences with no internal strength  or\r\n\r\ndistinctive  character.  If  we  cannot  create  this\r\n\r\ncharacter,  this  way of life of our  own,  something\r\n\r\nwhich  is  uniquely ours, then all the constitutional\r\n\r\nand  legal  apparatus  of  self-government  will  not\r\n\r\nprovide a satisfying life for us or save us from  the\r\n\r\ncreation   and  exploitation  of  domestic  divisions\r\n\r\nmotivated   by   external  influences  for   external\r\n\r\npurposes hostile to ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also a new community. Before the war, the\r\n\r\nmajority  of the people of Singapore were  immigrants\r\n\r\nwho had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  come with a fixed intention to stay and who  did\r\n\r\nnot  look upon themselves as Malayans. This has  been\r\n\r\nchanged by the effects of our population growth  and\r\n\r\nthe  experience of the Japanese occupation.  For  the\r\n\r\nfirst time in our history, the majority of the people\r\n\r\nand  the  very great majority of those under  21  are\r\n\r\nSingapore-born  and our citizens. Our  population  is\r\n\r\npredominantly and increasingly young, and the need to\r\n\r\ngive  an emotional and forward-looking element  to  a\r\n\r\nself-governing  state is all the more  important.  We\r\n\r\nmust  generate a feeling of pride in our achievements\r\n\r\nwhich,  though they may be small, can nonetheless  be\r\n\r\nsignificant   for  Asia  because   of   our   special\r\n\r\nopportunities and inheritances, and because we are  a\r\n\r\nshop-window on the great arterial sea routes of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look upon ourselves as perpetual poor cousins,\r\n\r\nalways  deprecating ourselves and  our  achievements,\r\n\r\nand  praising everything from other countries, we arc\r\n\r\nensuring  our decline. The proverb blames  those  who\r\n\r\ngave  a  dog a bad name which sticks, but  there  are\r\n\r\nsome of our community who believe that the dog should\r\n\r\nnot wait to be given a bad name but should give a bad\r\n\r\nname  to  itself. That attitude, Sir, is the negation\r\n\r\nof  nation-building and self-government. We  must  be\r\n\r\nproud of ourselves and be confident we can build  our\r\n\r\nfuture  as a nation. It is our aim to build ourselves\r\n\r\nas  part of the Malayan nation, whose birth has given\r\n\r\ninspiration  to  us  all  and  a  profound  sense  of\r\n\r\nadmiration   for,   and   congratulations   to,   our\r\n\r\nneighbours.  But  the  fact  that  we  seek  to  find\r\n\r\nourselves  does  not  prevent the  marriage  of  true\r\n\r\nminds,  which we look forward to, with the Federation\r\n\r\nof   Malaya   when   they  have  decided   that   our\r\n\r\ntemperaments are not too incompatible. As  the  Irish\r\n\r\nmight  say,  Sir,  better divorce for incompatibility\r\n\r\nbefore marriage than after, and the better the chance\r\n\r\nto learn compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are too, Sir, the great number of adult\r\n\r\ncitizens   who  have  made  this  country  of   their\r\n\r\nadoption.  This  is  their land in  which  they  have\r\n\r\nworked patiently and productively. They have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  contributed,  each in their  different  way,  to\r\n\r\nbuilding  up the commercial prosperity of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  their families with the education of our schools\r\n\r\nand with the opportunities and new horizons opened to\r\n\r\nthem  here have endowed us with a widening community,\r\n\r\nthe   new   talents  and  skills  and  wider   social\r\n\r\nactivities  of our younger generation  on  whom  must\r\n\r\nfall  the  crucial burden of making  or  marring  our\r\n\r\ngreat   experiment  in  self-government.  They   have\r\n\r\nretained  contacts  with  their  families  in   their\r\n\r\ncountries of origin for predominantly filial  reasons\r\n\r\nbut  as  the declining amount of remittances and  the\r\n\r\ngrowing movement to Singapore of parents have  shown,\r\n\r\nthis  country has become the country where they  wish\r\n\r\nto  live  in  the loyal focus of their families  who,\r\n\r\nremoving to Singapore, have had new opportunities  to\r\n\r\nsettle.  Our  success depends on the  achievement  of\r\n\r\ntheir loyalty and their Malayan outlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this group, Sir, who will have the greatest\r\n\r\nopportunity under this Bill. They have been reluctant\r\n\r\nto  take up the citizenship of the United Kingdom and\r\n\r\nthe    Colonies   which,   apart   from   its   legal\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  appeared to give up  one  non-Malayan\r\n\r\nnationality  for  another. They have  felt  that  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  naturalisation was a cumbrous  one  and,\r\n\r\nabove all, they have not appreciated to the full  the\r\n\r\nnecessity    for    taking    part    in    political\r\n\r\nresponsibilities when that position  seemed  to  have\r\n\r\nany element of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they have been in this position - citizens in\r\n\r\nfact  but without taking full legal rights - they  have\r\n\r\nin  some ways had the worst of both worlds. They have\r\n\r\nbeen  vulnerable  to criticism of  their  actions  by\r\n\r\nthose  in  our  midst and overseas  who  have  sought\r\n\r\nreasons  to doubt their essential loyalty. This  Bill\r\n\r\nwill give the opportunity to our older contemporaries\r\n\r\nto  set  the rumours of wagging tongues at rest.  The\r\n\r\ncitizenship  which they are offered  is  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship and their oath of loyalty will be to  the\r\n\r\nconstitution  of  Singapore. The  procedure  will  be\r\n\r\nsimpler  and the administration be under the  control\r\n\r\nof  the Government of Singapore exclusively. It is we\r\n\r\nin Singapore who will adjudicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  claims  for citizenship and  will  select  our\r\n\r\ncitizens, for it is we who know our fellows  and  who\r\n\r\nwill  suffer  the  consequences  of  misjudging   the\r\n\r\nloyalties  of those to whom we are prepared  to  give\r\n\r\nthe full powers and responsibilities of citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, they will have the free choice whether\r\n\r\nto  give  their uninhibited and undivided loyalty  to\r\n\r\nSingapore or whether to remain as aliens, welcome and\r\n\r\nfriendly   but  nevertheless  aliens  and  passengers\r\n\r\nrather  than actors, in our drama of self-government.\r\n\r\nThey  will  share  the final say in  all  matters  of\r\n\r\npolicy, political, social or economic, and they  will\r\n\r\nhave  every right and opportunity to play a full  and\r\n\r\nsatisfying  and  creative part in  our  community  of\r\n\r\nwidening horizons. In doing this it is misleading  to\r\n\r\nsay  that they will be welcome, for they are welcome,\r\n\r\nas they have been welcome, and we have treated them as of ourselves. But there has been no legal right, no\r\n\r\nlegal  rebuttal of malice or mischief. This they  can\r\n\r\nnow  have.  They will not only be one of the  family;\r\n\r\nthey  will have title deeds as members of the  family\r\n\r\nin our Singapore homeland. And as such they will have\r\n\r\nan  equal right in our democratic system to the vote,\r\n\r\nto  stand for election and to strive for the  highest\r\n\r\noffice whatever is their religion, their language  or\r\n\r\ntheir calling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we have a large element who continue\r\n\r\nlegally to be aliens, we think of communities not  so\r\n\r\nmuch  in  terms  of racial groups  but  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ncountries  of  origin. But now that we  will  all  be\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  together, we  will  be  judged  by  our\r\n\r\ncountry,   which   is  Singapore,  and   the   common\r\n\r\nallegiance will grow in strength of idea and  emotion\r\n\r\nuntil  the  communal divisions take  the  subordinate\r\n\r\nplace  which they inevitably must if Singapore is  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  name  of peace and harmony and not a  name  of\r\n\r\nunrest and disharmony.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have already seen the Bill and studied\r\n\r\nits clauses. These with the summary have already been\r\n\r\npublished  in  the  Press,  and  Members   will   not\r\n\r\ntherefore  expect  me  to  go  through  the  Bill  in\r\n\r\ncomplete  detail. The Bill follows in  the  main  the\r\n\r\npattern of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws in the Commonwealth  countries  and\r\n\r\nmany  of  its  provisions are taken from the  British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth   Act.  Citizenship  is  a   complicated\r\n\r\nsubject and must be adapted to an infinite variety of\r\n\r\ncircumstances and, for that reason, must be  set  out\r\n\r\nin precise detail. Perhaps, Sir, I may quote from the\r\n\r\nLondon  Times  an example of the kind of complication\r\n\r\nwhich arises:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"BABY WITHOUT A NATIONALITY<br>\r\n\r\nANGLO-AMERICAN BORN IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Times Correspondent\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">August 20, 1957.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Lewis born in France to an American airman\r\n\r\nand  his  English wife is in the predicament at  four\r\n\r\nmonths  of  being a stateless person. His  father,  a\r\n\r\nUnited  States  Air  Force  sergeant  stationed  near\r\n\r\nParis,  assumed the child would automatically  be  an\r\n\r\nAmerican,  but  the  United States  Embassy  has  now\r\n\r\ndisillusioned   him:  an  American  who   marries   a\r\n\r\nforeigner must have lived in the United States for 10\r\n\r\nconsecutive  years for his children to have  American\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  whereas  Sergeant  Lewis  was  born  in\r\n\r\nGermany and has spent only eight years in the  United\r\n\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife suggested that the child should be British\r\n\r\nbut  was  told  at the British Embassy  that  British\r\n\r\nnationality is transmitted exclusively by the father.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young couple then proposed that the son should\r\n\r\nbe French, only to discover that a foreign child born\r\n\r\non  French  soil must be registered with  the  French\r\n\r\nauthorities  at  birth  in  order  to  claim   French\r\n\r\nnationality, and now too much time has elapsed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in general, the status of a citizen of\r\n\r\nSingapore   may   be  acquired  by  birth, descent,\r\n\r\nregistration or naturalisation. The basic pattern  is\r\n\r\nthat  those born in Singapore, or those born  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore whose father at the time of his birth was a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen, shall be automatically  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens. Citizenship can be acquired by registration\r\n\r\nby  those born in the Federation of Malaya, by  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  citizens  of  the United  Kingdom  and  the\r\n\r\nColonies,  and  generally  citizens  of  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries.  Women  who  are married  to  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be  eligible  to  be  registered  as\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore. Special provision  is  made,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  enable persons who would not  otherwise  be\r\n\r\neligible  and  who  are of good  character  and  have\r\n\r\nresided   in  Singapore  throughout  the   10   years\r\n\r\nimmediately  preceding the coming into  operation  of\r\n\r\nthe provision, to apply for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizenship by registration. The application must  be\r\n\r\nmade within two years of the coming into force of the\r\n\r\nprovision  and  the  Minister has the  discretion  to\r\n\r\ngrant  or refuse the application. Persons who  become\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore by registration must take  the\r\n\r\noath of allegiance, and if the person is a subject or\r\n\r\ncitizen  of  a foreign country he must also  renounce\r\n\r\nsuch  foreign nationality or citizenship and,  if  so\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the  Minister, divest himself  of  such\r\n\r\nforeign nationality or citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to the 10-year residential\r\n\r\nqualification,  I received a letter dated  1st  July,\r\n\r\n1957,  from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce\r\n\r\nreading as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This Chamber is always keenly interested in\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship  which concerns  some  200,000\r\n\r\noverseas  Chinese who are qualified to  become  local\r\n\r\ncitizens.   It  is  understood  that  the   Bill   to\r\n\r\nenfranchise  them will be tabled soon.  The  question\r\n\r\nwas  discussed at a Committee meeting of this Chamber\r\n\r\nheld  on 28th June. The Committee think that it  will\r\n\r\nbe  much easier and simpler for an applicant to apply\r\n\r\nfor   such  citizenship  if  eight  years'  residence\r\n\r\ninstead of 10 be a qualification, which can be proved\r\n\r\nby   Identity  Cards  issued  in  1948.  The  meeting\r\n\r\nresolved  that  a  proposal  be  made  to  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  with  a view to enabling any  residents  of\r\n\r\nSingapore who has been here for eight years from  the\r\n\r\ndate  of  the  coming into force of the Ordinance  to\r\n\r\napply  for such citizenship. This proposal is  hereby\r\n\r\npresented to you for your favourable consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I indicated to the representatives of the\r\n\r\nChamber  at an interview that while I was sympathetic\r\n\r\nto  their request I had to point out that the 10-year\r\n\r\nresidential qualification had been agreed  to  by  an\r\n\r\nAll-Party  conference  held  in  February  1957   and\r\n\r\nendorsed  by the Legislative Assembly in  March  this\r\n\r\nyear,  and was subsequently accepted by the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice when the All-Party Delegation negotiated for a\r\n\r\nnew  constitution during the last visit to London  in\r\n\r\nMarch/April this year. I expressed the view that this\r\n\r\nmatter  would have eventually to be debated  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  before  it  could  be  taken  up  with  the\r\n\r\nColonial  Office. Sir, I propose to commit this  Bill\r\n\r\nto a Select Committee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  will  no doubt take due note  of  the  views\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  hon. Members in this  debate  in  this\r\n\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, citizenship can also be acquired by\r\n\r\nnaturalisation   by  persons  intending   to   reside\r\n\r\npermanently  in  Singapore who are of  full  age  and\r\n\r\ncapacity, of good character and have resided  in  the\r\n\r\ncolony   for  at  least  10  out  of  the  12   years\r\n\r\nimmediately  preceding  their  application.   Special\r\n\r\nprovision is made for persons who are serving in  the\r\n\r\narmed  forces.  The  Minister  has  a  discretion  in\r\n\r\napproving  applications  for  naturalisation,  and  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  acquires citizenship  by  naturalisation\r\n\r\nmust  take  the oath of allegiance, and if  he  is  a\r\n\r\nsubject  or  citizen  of a foreign  country  he  must\r\n\r\nrenounce such foreign nationality or citizenship, and\r\n\r\nat  the  end, if so required by the Minister,  divest\r\n\r\nhimself  of  such foreign nationality or citizenship.\r\n\r\nMinor  children of persons who obtain citizenship  by\r\n\r\nregistration   or  naturalisation  may   be   granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship by registration on application being made\r\n\r\nby their parents or guardians.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in calculating residence in Singapore periods\r\n\r\nof  absence  for purposes of education or health,  or\r\n\r\nany  other  cause  approved by the Minister,  may  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as residence in Singapore, and short periods\r\n\r\nof  absence amounting in the aggregate to  less  than\r\n\r\nsix  months  will be disregarded. Periods of  service\r\n\r\nwith the armed forces not maintained in Singapore  or\r\n\r\nwith departments of the United Kingdom Government  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of persons not recruited in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nnot be counted as residence in Singapore.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision for renunciation of citizenship\r\n\r\nand  deprivation  of citizenship follow  clearly  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the British Nationality Act.  Where  a\r\n\r\nperson makes a declaration renouncing his citizenship\r\n\r\nof   Singapore,   the  Minister   shall   cause   the\r\n\r\ndeclaration   to   be  registered   and   upon   such\r\n\r\nregistration that person will cease to be  a  citizen\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. It is provided that the  Minister  may\r\n\r\nwithhold registration of any such declaration if made\r\n\r\nduring any war in which the Queen may be engaged. The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  power to declare  that  a  person  has\r\n\r\nceased to be a citizen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  he  is satisfied that that person has voluntarily\r\n\r\nacquired  citizenship  of  any  foreign  country   or\r\n\r\nexercised the rights of a citizen in such a  country.\r\n\r\nThe Minister may also deprive of citizenship a person\r\n\r\nwho  has  acquired the citizenship  of  Singapore  by\r\n\r\nregistration  or naturalisation if it is  shown  that\r\n\r\nsuch   citizenship  was  acquired  by  fraud,   false\r\n\r\nrepresentation or mistake, or if the person has shown\r\n\r\nhimself  disaffected  towards  Her  Majesty  or   the\r\n\r\nconstitution   of  Singapore,  or  has   in   wartime\r\n\r\nunlawfully traded or associated with an enemy, or has\r\n\r\nbeen  sentenced  to  a term of imprisonment  for  two\r\n\r\nyears  or more, or has for seven years resided  in  a\r\n\r\nforeign country. In all such cases the Minister must,\r\n\r\nbefore   depriving  a  person  of   citizenship,   be\r\n\r\nsatisfied that it is not conducive to the public good\r\n\r\nthat  the  person should continue to be a citizen  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Notice in writing must he  given  to  the\r\n\r\nperson  affected  before an order of  deprivation  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is made, and such person will  have  the\r\n\r\nright  to  have his case referred to a  committee  of\r\n\r\nenquiry consisting of a chairman who must be a person\r\n\r\nqualified to be a judge and two other persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there may be differences over the details of\r\n\r\nthis Bill and, as stated earlier, I propose that  the\r\n\r\nBill  should be committed to a Select Committee. Sir,\r\n\r\nas  the date of the general elections, which is  also\r\n\r\nthe  date  of  the  coming  into  force  of  the  new\r\n\r\nconstitution, is geared to our citizenship proposals,\r\n\r\nit  is  the intention of the Government to  have  the\r\n\r\nThird  Reading  of this Bill at the sitting  on  16th\r\n\r\nOctober.  I  would  therefore urge  upon  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee when appointed to expedite deliberations of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill and endeavour to report back to this  House\r\n\r\nin time for the October sitting in order to allow the\r\n\r\nmaximum time for the period of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however much difference there may be in detail,\r\n\r\nI am sure that we all welcome this Bill towards which\r\n\r\nevery  Party  represented in this House  has  made  a\r\n\r\ncontribution.  I feel it a privilege  that  as  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister it falls to me to move the Second Reading of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  which  represents  a  major  advance   in\r\n\r\nSingapore's political development. We have now become\r\n\r\na  settled community and, with this view, the loyalty\r\n\r\nof  those who have made this island their second home\r\n\r\nwill  find  legal recognition. This  brings  a  great\r\n\r\nstrengthening  of  our community, a strengthening  in\r\n\r\nthe  sense  of  our  common  responsibility  for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  a  Singapore which, by  its  policy  of\r\n\r\nsocial welfare, by its achievement of political unity\r\n\r\nand   by   its  co-operation  in  building   economic\r\n\r\nprosperity, will make a reality in our public life of\r\n\r\nall  the warmth and inspiration we associate  in  our\r\n\r\ndomestic  life  with  the words  \"home  and  family\".\r\n\r\nThrough  this Bill, Sir, we will be able to say  with\r\n\r\nunited voice, \"Majulah Singapura!\", and tomorrow with\r\n\r\neven greater strength and unity, \"Merdeka Singapura!\"\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.32 a.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at\r\n\r\nlong  last the Citizenship Bill has come before  this\r\n\r\nHouse  for  the Second Reading. I say  at  long  last\r\n\r\nbecause this Bill should have come before this  House\r\n\r\na  very long time before. In 1956 when we first  went\r\n\r\nto  London,  we  too  had an All-Party  Committee  to\r\n\r\ndeliberate on what we should do with this question of\r\n\r\ncitizenship, and there was agreement then,  agreement\r\n\r\nnot  only  amongst  the  Parties  but  also  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  London, lithe  Government  had   the\r\n\r\nintention  of pushing the Bill through it could  have\r\n\r\ndrawn it up, and it could even have been presented to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly a year ago. But there was always  that\r\n\r\nlong  delay  and only until questions in  this  House\r\n\r\nwere asked as to when this Bill could be presented to\r\n\r\nthe Assembly, I think then Government started working\r\n\r\non it and put up this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Complete\r\n\r\nnonsense!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> But anyway, I am happy that the\r\n\r\nBill  has  come to this House for Second Reading  and\r\n\r\nwhatever we can say the Government seemed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nto  think  that it is time they should speed  up  the\r\n\r\nwork  and are now asking that we should hurry through\r\n\r\nit  as quickly as possible. Yes, if it is a case  of\r\n\r\ngetting  this Bill through as quickly as we  can,  we\r\n\r\nhave  always been of the opinion that it should  have\r\n\r\nbeen  passed a long time ago and we shall  give  them\r\n\r\nthat co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good thing, Sir, that at last we have a Bill\r\n\r\nthat  will make all who reside in Singapore  and  all\r\n\r\nwho  regard  Singapore as their home  and  object  of\r\n\r\nloyalty a chance to become citizens of Singapore. It\r\n\r\nis most peculiar, especially in this country, that we\r\n\r\nhave  a population half of which is not its citizens.\r\n\r\nAll  along  we  have heard dissatisfaction  from  the\r\n\r\npeople because, they say, although they contribute to\r\n\r\nthe  coffers  of the colony they have never  had  the\r\n\r\nopportunity of a say in its affairs. They have wanted\r\n\r\nto  be part and parcel of this country. We give  them\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity;  we recognise  this  long-standing\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I agree with those who say that\r\n\r\nthe  destiny  of Singapore is in the hands  of  those\r\n\r\nborn  here,  but  those who created the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  who now have the vote have never  had  the\r\n\r\nvote.  During the last elections, of course, the  old\r\n\r\nstable  elements, the people who can  think  soberly,\r\n\r\ncould not exercise a voice in its affairs. With  this\r\n\r\nnew  Bill and with the rights given them, I think the\r\n\r\nfuture  of Singapore will he bright because then  the\r\n\r\nstable  elements  will have as  much  a  say  as  the\r\n\r\nyounger people, their sons, their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With inequality in a country affecting a large\r\n\r\nproportion  of people, the Government can never  rule\r\n\r\nefficiently.  There will not be that  degree  of  co-operation  when  the people think that  they  do  not\r\n\r\nbelong to this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome this Bill because of all these aspects.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir, on looking through this Bill,  I  must\r\n\r\nsay that I am not satisfied with some parts of it. If\r\n\r\nwe  turn,  Sir, to clause 22 (3) (a) on page  8,  you\r\n\r\nwill see that the Minister may, by order, deprive  a\r\n\r\ncitizen of Singapore by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregistration or by naturalization of his  citizenship\r\n\r\nif  he  is  satisfied  that that  citizen  has  shown\r\n\r\nhimself   by   act  or  speech  to  be  disloyal   or\r\n\r\ndisaffected  towards Her Majesty or the  Constitution\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  Sir, I have been wondering,  if  this\r\n\r\nBill  comes into force, whether such people who have\r\n\r\nraved  against the Rendel Constitution  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould be deprived of their citizenship. And this,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  affects  not only Ministers but  Assemblymen.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the \"Constitution of Singapore\"? Is  it  the\r\n\r\nRendel Constitution we are thinking about, or  is  it\r\n\r\nthe constitution that is coming into force? It is all\r\n\r\nin  the  air.  What  I am thinking  is  probably  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   may  be  thinking  of  the   \"State   of\r\n\r\nSingapore\".  But  still we are not a  state;  we  are\r\n\r\nstill  not an independent country. And I would  like\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Attorney-General to show us examples  of\r\n\r\nhow,  in  the matter of speech or act, the Government\r\n\r\nwill take action against such persons to deprive them\r\n\r\nof citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9, Sir, deals with the registration of\r\n\r\ncitizens  of persons residing in Singapore throughout\r\n\r\nthe  last  10 years. I agree with the Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  that all Parties have come to an  agreement\r\n\r\non  this matter, but my Party has proposed that it be\r\n\r\nseven  years. We will stand by what we have  proposed\r\n\r\nbefore  on compromise,, but we are agreeable to  hear\r\n\r\nall  views  put  forward, and  we  can  certainly  be\r\n\r\npersuaded to come to a period of eight years. In fact\r\n\r\nI  personally  think that eight  years  is  the  most\r\n\r\nreasonable time. We say that we follow the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  in all things and in a case like  this  I\r\n\r\nthink  in  the  Federation they fixed the  period  as\r\n\r\neight years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 (a) fixes the period of absence from the\r\n\r\ncolony  at  less  than  six months  for  purposes  of\r\n\r\ncalculation of residence. I think since this Bill  is\r\n\r\ngoing into Select Committee, I would like Members  on\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee to consider this question of six\r\n\r\nmonths very carefully. Singapore is a commercial city\r\n\r\nand  many  people have to travel to  do  business  or\r\n\r\nother things, and it may be that a longer period will\r\n\r\nbe possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, however, Sir, we support this Bill and\r\n\r\nwe   hope  that  when  it  comes  up  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore - those who are eligible or who will be made\r\n\r\neligible - will  come forward and claim  themselves  as\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore. I hope too, Sir,  that  since\r\n\r\nthey had a long period to think about this matter  of\r\n\r\nwhether  to be Singapore citizens or aliens,  I  wish\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  make  their  decision  as  fast  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.43 a.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  do  agree with the Hon. the Chief Minister as well\r\n\r\nas  the  Member  who  has just spoken,  that  we  all\r\n\r\nwelcome this long-awaited Citizenship Bill. With  the\r\n\r\nexception  of clauses 9 and 15. I consider this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  as  satisfactory  as it  can  be.  It  is  rather\r\n\r\nregrettable that in spite of the representations that\r\n\r\nhave been made by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce  as\r\n\r\nwell  as other public bodies, Government has not seen\r\n\r\nfit  to  reduce the residence qualification to  eight\r\n\r\nyears as in the Federation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is almost a unanimous clamouring by\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese Press for such a reduction, I  have  not\r\n\r\nseen any Press statements or otherwise giving a valid\r\n\r\nreason  against it. The only one I have seen  is  the\r\n\r\none  in  the editorial of the Straits Times  on  28th\r\n\r\nAugust,  1957. In fact the editor advised me  that  I\r\n\r\nshould not ask for such a reduction as he was of  the\r\n\r\nopinion that I would never be successful. The reasons\r\n\r\ngiven  by  him against such a proposal are  two.  The\r\n\r\nfirst is that I was satisfied then and the matter  of\r\n\r\nreduction  was an afterthought; the second,  it  will\r\n\r\nonly affect 5 per cent of the number of persons to be\r\n\r\nenfranchised.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the argument that it is a question of\r\n\r\nafterthought.  Yes,  I  agree  that  we  were   quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied then because we believed that 10 years  was\r\n\r\na  fair compromise, but in view of the publication of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution  for  the Federation  I  think  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of 10 years should be reduced to eight.  What\r\n\r\nis  wrong  with  afterthoughts?  Are  we  not  making\r\n\r\namendments  to Bills at almost every sitting  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly   in   view   of  experience   of   changing\r\n\r\ncircumstances? If we can do that, there is no  reason\r\n\r\nwhy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  amend  this Bill to  reduce  the  period.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the question that the proposal affects only\r\n\r\n5 per cent of the people to be enfranchised. Assuming\r\n\r\nthat  the number to be enfranchised is 200,000;  five\r\n\r\nper  cent  of this will be approximately 10,000  and,\r\n\r\ntogether  with dependants and relatives,  the  number\r\n\r\naffected will be nearly 30,000 to 40,000. The  entire\r\n\r\nEuropean population, including women and children,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, is approximately 18,000 people.  Does  it\r\n\r\nmean  that  because  there are  only  18.000  people,\r\n\r\nwhatever  fair request by them should be  ignored  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government? With due respect to the  paper  that\r\n\r\nmust have the biggest circulation amongst the English-speaking public, I must say the argument put  forward\r\n\r\nis hollow indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of looking at the question of a\r\n\r\nCitizenship Bill. One is where a certain party  asked\r\n\r\nfor  it  and  we just  put up a  Bill  but  to  place\r\n\r\nwhatever obstacles we can think of in the way  so  as\r\n\r\nto  prevent  as many people as possible from  getting\r\n\r\nit. Another way of looking at it is that we sincerely\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  these  people  who  are  about  to  be\r\n\r\nenfranchised  are beneficial to this colony,  and  do\r\n\r\neverything  possible  to help  them  to  obtain  such\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  I do not believe anyone in  this  House\r\n\r\nhas the opinion of the former and therefore we try to\r\n\r\ndo   what  we  can  to  help  the  people  to  obtain\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before going into the matter any further let us\r\n\r\njust  try to see what type of people we are about  to\r\n\r\nenfranchise. Are they beneficial to this  colony,  or\r\n\r\ndo  they form a potential danger to it? These people,\r\n\r\nmostly Chinese, must have come from their native land\r\n\r\nwhen  young  and, through sweat and hard  work,  have\r\n\r\nhelped  to  build up the prosperity of  this  colony.\r\n\r\nApart  from  the  Europeans, I believe  they  are  in\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  most of the big industries and  business\r\n\r\nhouses  today. With the exception maybe of a  few,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they are all anti-Communist. These  people,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  will  be an asset to this colony  and  with\r\n\r\ncitizenship I am sure they will strive hard to make a\r\n\r\nbetter  Singapore,  as  they can  then  devote  their\r\n\r\nentire loyalty to this land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for reduction of the period to eight\r\n\r\nyears  is  that  I believe the best way  of  checking\r\n\r\nresidence  qualification is  by  the  Identity  Card.\r\n\r\nIdentity  Cards  were issued from the  beginning  of\r\n\r\nOctober  1948  and  dragged over in  1949.  From  the\r\n\r\ninformation   given  by  the  National   Registration\r\n\r\nOffice,  50,000  of these cards were  issued  in1949.\r\n\r\nWith a view to registering about 200,000 people in  a\r\n\r\nmatter of a few months, in order that they should  be\r\n\r\nplaced   on  the  electoral  rolls  for  the   coming\r\n\r\nelections,  I think the one and only way  is  through\r\n\r\nthe Identity Card system, if the question of 10 years\r\n\r\nis  to be insisted upon, then the earliest a man  can\r\n\r\nprove   his   residence  qualification  through   his\r\n\r\nIdentity Card is October 1958, making the question of\r\n\r\nelections in August 1958 an impossibility. There  may\r\n\r\nbe  persons  who  may  not be  able  to  furnish  the\r\n\r\nevidence   of   residential  qualification   to   the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of the officer concerned. In this way we\r\n\r\nwill be defeating the purpose for which this Bill  is\r\n\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In asking for this reduction to eight years, I\r\n\r\nsincerely  believe it will not harm the interests  of\r\n\r\nany community, otherwise I would not ask for it. I am\r\n\r\nglad  that  the Hon. the Chief Minister has  proposed\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill  should  be  referred  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, where this matter will be further thrashed\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.54 a.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nfully  agree  with the hon. Member for Serangoon  in\r\n\r\nhis comments that this Bill has at long last made its\r\n\r\nappearance in this Assembly. The Government  in  fact\r\n\r\nshould  or  could have prepared or drafted this  Bill\r\n\r\nmuch earlier. To force it through now, to rush it  in\r\n\r\na  matter of a month and five days and report back to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, is too fast work. If  this  Bill  had\r\n\r\nbeen  prepared  much earlier, I do  not  think  there\r\n\r\nwould be need for this rush. But I would not, just as\r\n\r\nthe   hon.  Member  for  Pasir  Panjang,  attack  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   for  not  seeing  fit  to   reduce   the\r\n\r\nresidential  qualification period to eight  years.  I\r\n\r\npresume that this Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  drafted  under an all-Party  agreement  and  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  drafted  in  the  way  that  was  agreed.\r\n\r\nTherefore  I must congratulate the Government,  after\r\n\r\nrepresentations made by the public, the Chinese Press\r\n\r\nand  the Chamber of Commerce, that it is prepared  to\r\n\r\ncommit  this Bill to a Select Committee so that  all\r\n\r\nreferences made here and in public could be carefully\r\n\r\ngone  into. I also hope that the Committee will  take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration and make available  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor   oral  representations, and  not  only  receive\r\n\r\nwritten representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While going through this Bill, Sir, there are two\r\n\r\npoints  of  importance which should  receive  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration,  and my two points  agree  again  with\r\n\r\nthose of the Member for Serangoon. The first point is\r\n\r\nthe powers of the Minister, and the second again the\r\n\r\nquestion  of residential qualifications. I will  deal\r\n\r\nnow with the first point. To entrust the whole burden\r\n\r\nof  discretion  on  the  hands  of  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  too heavy a burden. Although there  is  a\r\n\r\nclause which gives provision for appeal, to give  the\r\n\r\nMinister arbitrary powers to withdraw any citizenship\r\n\r\nthat has been given or to disallow any citizenship is\r\n\r\ntoo  much.  We have a Council of Ministers comprising\r\n\r\nof nine Ministers with the Governor as chairman.  I\r\n\r\nthink that all such powers should be entrusted to the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Ministers rather than  to  the  Minister\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of residential qualification;\r\n\r\nwhy  10 years? Why not five, or three, or even  seven\r\n\r\nor eight?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Or none at all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Or none at all? The hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Pasir  Panjang has suggested eight and  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber of people, too, have the opinion that eight is\r\n\r\nquite  reasonable. When ten years was agreed, I think\r\n\r\nthe  question was not carefully gone into at the  all\r\n\r\nParty  meeting,  and  I think  this  is  because  the\r\n\r\nIndependents were left out! Otherwise the  suggestion\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  made. The hon.  Member  for  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang  said it is now an afterthought; although  he\r\n\r\nagreed originally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  should  be 10 years, it should now be reduced  to\r\n\r\neight  years.  An  afterthought  is  never  too  late\r\n\r\nbecause  if  it  is  good, in the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, it should be considered. I understand,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  in the United States only five years' residence\r\n\r\nis   required  to  apply  for  citizenship, in   the\r\n\r\nFederation, as the hon. Member for Pasir Panjang also\r\n\r\nsaid, it requires only eight years; and our Singapore\r\n\r\nlaw for naturalisation only requires seven years.  So\r\n\r\nwhy  then  a  figure  of 10 rather  than  considering\r\n\r\neight, seven or five? If we take eight years, I agree\r\n\r\nwith  the comments of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce\r\n\r\nthat  as the Identity Card system came into being  in\r\n\r\n1948 it will be very convenient for the Government as\r\n\r\nwell   as  the  public  to  prove  their  residential\r\n\r\nqualifications through their Identity Cards; with the\r\n\r\nfigure 10, nothing can be produced to prove residence\r\n\r\nof 10 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister said lately that he\r\n\r\nwould  call  another all-Party conference to  discuss\r\n\r\nthis  matter. I wonder if he has done it and, if  so,\r\n\r\nwhat  is the result of that conference and why a Bill\r\n\r\ndrafted  in  this  way  has been  placed  before  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  One thing that strikes me, Sir,  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand    why    the   period   of    residential\r\n\r\nqualification is two years longer than that  required\r\n\r\nin  the Federation? The Hon. the Chief Minister  said\r\n\r\nthis  morning that he is looking forward to  the  day\r\n\r\nwhen  Singapore could be merged with the  Federation.\r\n\r\nIf  that day should come, what would happen, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  requires only  eight  years  whereas\r\n\r\nSingapore  requires  10? What of  the  difference  in\r\n\r\npolicy then and how will both Governments, which will\r\n\r\nthen be one Government, deal with the matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, naturalisation only requires\r\n\r\nseven  years and if we are going to enforce  stricter\r\n\r\nqualifications for the application of  citizenship  I\r\n\r\nthink we shall be losing sight of the basic principle\r\n\r\nof relaxing qualifications and encouraging our people\r\n\r\nto become Singaporeans. All political Parties whether\r\n\r\nin this House or outside this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  have always claimed that they will  fight  for\r\n\r\nthe  rights of the people. I think this is the chance\r\n\r\nnow to show their sincerity, and this is the time  to\r\n\r\nshow that they will, in fact, fight for the rights of\r\n\r\nthe    people,    by   relaxing   these   residential\r\n\r\nqualifications. If we really enforce this  period  of\r\n\r\n10  years  I  doubt that we will be  encouraging  the\r\n\r\npeople to become Singaporeans. But if we relax it, as\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member for Pasir Panjang said, we will have\r\n\r\nan  average of 10,000 people - I estimate it at  13,000\r\n\r\nbecause  260,000  may  be  affected - and  13,000  more\r\n\r\npeople   will  be  allowed  to  register  or   become\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  That  will again help  them  to  elect\r\n\r\ntheir representatives to this Assembly and have their\r\n\r\nrights.  If  we are going to enforce 10 years  it  is\r\n\r\ntantamount  to  forsaking our  own  people  here  and\r\n\r\ndiscriminating against our own people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compare the residential qualifications required\r\n\r\nfor  citizens or residents of the Federation,  or  of\r\n\r\nthe  Commonwealth countries, or even  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom. If you read clause 8, Sir, it merely says:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A person shall be entitled, on making application\r\n\r\ntherefor to the Minister in the prescribed manner, to\r\n\r\nbe  registered  as  a  citizen  of  Singapore  if  he\r\n\r\nsatisfies the Minister that he-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) is of full age and capacity; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) has resided in the Colony throughout the two\r\n\r\nyears   immediately  preceding  the   date   of\r\n\r\napplication; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) is either-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a person born in the Federation of Malaya; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) citizen of the United Kingdom and\r\n\r\nColonies; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) citizen of a Commonwealth country which has\r\n\r\nbeen specified by the Minister\r\n\r\nby   notification  in  the  Gazette  to  be   a\r\n\r\nCommonwealth   country  to  which   this   sub-paragraph applies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, why discriminate against our own people?\r\n\r\nWhy  do  we  allow people from outside  to  have  two\r\n\r\nyears' residential qualification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Allah ma!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> \"Allah ma!\" the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  exclaims.

I suggest that the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown study the provisions more  thoroughly\r\n\r\nbefore he comes and speaks to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.03 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have\r\n\r\nlistened  with considerable interest to the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister's  exposition on this  Bill.  He  has\r\n\r\nexplained  a number of points but there are  quite  a\r\n\r\nfew  more  which require elucidation. It is important\r\n\r\nthat   the  citizens-to-be  of  this  country  should\r\n\r\nunderstand clearly what the intentions of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment are, particularly as representations to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee of this House are to be invited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I wish to relate the definition of\r\n\r\n\"Commonwealth country\" in clause 2 to clause 8 (2) as\r\n\r\nproposed  to be amended. Clause 2 as proposed  to  be\r\n\r\namended  lists  the  Commonwealth countries  and  now\r\n\r\nindirectly  by  reversion to the British  Nationality\r\n\r\nAct,  1948,  and these are presumably to  remain  the\r\n\r\nsame countries as listed in the present clause 2. But\r\n\r\nin  clause 8, whether in the present version  or  the\r\n\r\nversion with the proposed amendment, the Minister can\r\n\r\napparently pick and choose the Commonwealth countries\r\n\r\nhe considers eligible for citizenship by registration\r\n\r\nby  notification  in the Gazette.  In  this  context,\r\n\r\nPakistan  could be excluded, Ghana could be excluded,\r\n\r\nAustralia could be excluded. It seems to us important\r\n\r\nthat the Government should explain the intentions  in\r\n\r\nthis  matter.  Why not leave clause 8 (1)  (c)  (iii)\r\n\r\nthat permits a citizen of a Commonwealth country with\r\n\r\nno powers of exclusion handed to the Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I wish to relate together clauses 8, 9 and\r\n\r\n15.  Clause 8, which states briefly a person born  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, or a citizen of the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nand  Colonies, or a citizen of a Commonwealth country\r\n\r\nmust   have  two  years'  residential  qualification,\r\n\r\nremains permanent. On the other hand, clause 9  which\r\n\r\nrefers  to those excluded under clause 8, has a  two-year  life  and  lapses al the end  of  that  period.\r\n\r\nClause  15,  referring to naturalisation,  presumably\r\n\r\n(because  further  explanation is  needed)  virtually\r\n\r\ncomes  into  operation after two years and supersedes\r\n\r\nclause  9  but  not clause 8. Nobody,  one  imagines,\r\n\r\nwould  want to naturalise so long as clause 9  is  in\r\n\r\noperation,  and nobody eligible under clause  8  will\r\n\r\never  want  to  naturalise. If this is the  case  and\r\n\r\nclause  15 is, so to speak, a follow-on to clause  9,\r\n\r\nthen it seems that if the words \"to whom section 8 of\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance does not apply\" should be inserted  in\r\n\r\nclause 15 as they have been in clause 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to clause 9, there is only one observation\r\n\r\nI  would  wish to make. Regarding the period  of  ten\r\n\r\nyears or eight years or whatever it might be that the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee may consider, we  are  quite  happy\r\n\r\nthat  this  matter be thrashed out by that Committee.\r\n\r\nReference  has been made to the fact that  we  should\r\n\r\nfollow  the Federation period of eight years  but  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  careful to see whether our  clause  9  is\r\n\r\nexactly parallel. In the Federation Constitution, the\r\n\r\nrelevant  section  states that  a  person  must  have\r\n\r\n\"resided  in  the Federation during the twelve  years\r\n\r\nimmediately preceding the date of his application for\r\n\r\na  period amounting in the aggregate to not less than\r\n\r\neight  years\".  Clause 9 of this Bill,  the  relevant\r\n\r\nsection  is  that  he  has  \"resided  in  the  Colony\r\n\r\nthroughout  the ten years immediately  preceding  the\r\n\r\ndate  of  the coming into operation of this  Part  of\r\n\r\nthis Ordinance\". Quite apart from the question of ten\r\n\r\nyears   or  eight  years,  there  is  a  considerable\r\n\r\ndifference  between the two sections. The  Federation\r\n\r\nperiod  is counted from the date of application;  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  period  is  counted  from  the   date   of\r\n\r\noperation  of  the Ordinance. In other  words,  if  I\r\n\r\nunderstand it, if in Singapore you apply to  register\r\n\r\nat  the  end of the two-year period, you will,  under\r\n\r\nthe  present  Bill,  have to have resided  almost  12\r\n\r\nyears  in the colony. This seems to us open  to  some\r\n\r\nobjection and will require looking into in the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to clause 22, where there is another\r\n\r\ndifference from the Federation Constitution.  At  the\r\n\r\nend of subsection (3) of section 25 of the Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution, which is parallel to sub-clause (3)  of\r\n\r\nclause  22  in  this Bill, there is a  proviso  which\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provided that no person shall be deprived of his\r\n\r\ncitizenship under this clause if as a result of  such\r\n\r\ndeprivation he will not be a citizen of any country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proviso has been omitted from our Bill although\r\n\r\nit  seems to be needed, particularly in view  of  the\r\n\r\nremarks  made by the Hon. the Chief Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech, and we would like to know whether this is  an\r\n\r\nintentional omission or an oversight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in clause 22 I would refer the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  to  sub-clause  (3)  (c),  deprivation   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  if  the citizen \"has within  five  years\r\n\r\nafter  registration or naturalisation been  sentenced\r\n\r\nin any country to imprisonment for a term of not less\r\n\r\nthan  two  years.\" Surely this should be  limited  to\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for  crimes of  a  serious  or  heinous\r\n\r\nnature? Would it not be absurd to deprive a person of\r\n\r\nsuch a precious thing as citizenship if the crime  is\r\n\r\na motor accident?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I come to clause 25. The Bill itself is one\r\n\r\nthing but the procedure by which it is to be put into\r\n\r\neffect  will  make  or  mar its success.  There  will\r\n\r\npresumably   be   two   forms  of   application   for\r\n\r\nregistration  of  citizens, one  for  those  eligible\r\n\r\nunder clause 8 and one for those under clause 9.  The\r\n\r\nformer group will for the most part be those who will\r\n\r\nhave to be struck off the present electoral rolls but\r\n\r\napparently are not specified as having to be of  good\r\n\r\ncharacter. The latter group are those who so far have\r\n\r\nbeen  aliens ineligible for the vote and who have  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy the Minister that they are of good character.\r\n\r\nBut whether application is to be made under clause  8\r\n\r\nor  clause  9,  it  is essential  that  the  greatest\r\n\r\npossible  simplicity in procedure  is  observed,  and\r\n\r\nthose eligible to apply are not frightened off  by  a\r\n\r\nmultiplicity  of requirements as if they  were  being\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  an inquisition. If similar  forms  are\r\n\r\nused  as  those now used for naturalisation  and  the\r\n\r\nsame expense is involved, nobody will register except\r\n\r\nthose  regimented  to do so. We hope  the  system  of\r\n\r\nfinding  four  persons  of  high  status  to  sponsor\r\n\r\napplications  will  not  be  introduced.  Sponsorship\r\n\r\nunder  the present naturalisation rules are virtually\r\n\r\na waste of time. However high and mighty the sponsor,\r\n\r\nit is practically of no avail-the ultimate test is  a\r\n\r\npass of good character by the C.I.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only simplicity, and I would add speed, in\r\n\r\nprocedure,  without any feeling of  persecution  will\r\n\r\nbring   forward  the  registration  as  citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  the 200,000 or so for whom  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nprimarily  designed, and I hope  that  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister will indicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat   is  in  his  mind  in  this  respect  so  that\r\n\r\nconfidence can be engendered in the public mind  here\r\n\r\nand   now.   In   addition,  the  places   to   which\r\n\r\napplications  for registration will be made  must  be\r\n\r\nnumerous  and  easy of access, and the officials  who\r\n\r\nassist  the  applicants must  be  trained  to  be  as\r\n\r\nhelpful as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the passing of the Bill is one\r\n\r\nthing,  but  the  right  psychological  approach   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's  future citizens in order to  obtain  the\r\n\r\nmaximum   registration,   is   the   most   important\r\n\r\nconsideration. In this the Government  bears  a  very\r\n\r\nheavy responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is time to suspend.

We have  been\r\n\r\nconsistent  in  trying to enlarge  the  franchise  in\r\n\r\norder  that  the  people of this  country  can  speak\r\n\r\nthrough the representatives voted by them and because\r\n\r\nof  this  we  also  asked that the period  for  which\r\n\r\npersons who were to be granted citizenship should  be\r\n\r\nseven years instead of eight years when there was  an\r\n\r\nall-Party conference before the delegation  left  for\r\n\r\nLondon in 1955. In order to present a common front to\r\n\r\nLondon, we agreed to a compromise and we accepted ten\r\n\r\nyears  but  now that the Federation in its generosity\r\n\r\nhas granted citizenship to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersons who have lived in the Federation for 5 out of\r\n\r\n12  years  I  think, Sir, we have a case to  ask  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's Government to reconsider the clause in  our\r\n\r\nconstitution  whereby we agreed  to  ten  years.

The  contents have been known to the public  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  for the last two years and I am sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee can finish their deliberations\r\n\r\nin two to three weeks at the latest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there is one thing I want to stress:\r\n\r\nwe  want to hold the elections at the earliest moment\r\n\r\nand  one  of  the Members of my Party on  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee will move a proviso that those who want  to\r\n\r\nregister  should  register as early as  possible  and\r\n\r\nthat  those  who  register by  31st  December,  1957,\r\n\r\nshould  get a chance in the first election.

Today all kinds  of  people\r\n\r\njust  because they are living and working  in  Malaya\r\n\r\nhave  claimed  the right and are in our  local  Press\r\n\r\ncalled \"Malayans\", Indeed some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolitical commentators of foreign origin and  foreign\r\n\r\nloyalty  have  the  audacity to  write  articles  and\r\n\r\neditorials  in  which they cloak their foreign  views\r\n\r\nbehind  the  phrase \"we Malayans\".

However, I  am  somewhat\r\n\r\nperturbed  to listen to the speeches of some  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers of this Assembly, one after another, who have\r\n\r\nbeen standing up making suggestions or proposals that\r\n\r\nthe  residential qualification for citizenship should\r\n\r\nbe  reduced  from ten to eight years. Arguments  have\r\n\r\nbeen  brought forward particularly by two Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly who said that if in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya the residential qualification is eight out  of\r\n\r\nthe last twelve years then why we in Singapore should\r\n\r\nnot  also adopt the same policy. Well, Sir, I do  not\r\n\r\nsee  the  logic of this argument. If we are going  to\r\n\r\nfollow  what the Federation does, I say this: let  us\r\n\r\nfollow it all the way and not half the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here, Sir, in my hand a document which is the\r\n\r\nReport  of  the  Singapore Constitutional  Conference\r\n\r\nheld  in  London in March and April 1957. This  is  a\r\n\r\ndocument  which  is  an agreement  drawn  after  long\r\n\r\ndeliberations  and discussions and it was  signed  by\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  Assembly who themselves  represent\r\n\r\nresponsible political Parties. I hope, Sir, that this\r\n\r\ndocument  will  not be turned into a piece  of  scrap\r\n\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill has to\r\n\r\nbe  judged according to whether or not it measures up\r\n\r\nto   the   Report  of  the  Singapore  Constitutional\r\n\r\nConference  held in London in March and  April  1957.\r\n\r\nAll  Parties signed this Report and the proposals  on\r\n\r\ncitizenship are contained in paragraphs 49, 50 and 51\r\n\r\nof  the  Report.  The  spirit of  our  intentions  is\r\n\r\ncontained in this Report. Whether or not that  spirit\r\n\r\nhas been translated into the administrative machinery\r\n\r\nof the Bill is the test by which I suggest the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee be guided in its deliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship is essentially a question of loyalty. A\r\n\r\nman  is  a  citizen of a state and has the  right  to\r\n\r\ndetermine the future of the state because he is  part\r\n\r\nof  an entity. It is really a subjective question: Is\r\n\r\nthis my country? Do I owe it undivided loyalty? Am  I\r\n\r\nprepared  to fight and die for it, if necessary?  But\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  known test yet that you  can  apply-no\r\n\r\nknown lie-detector or psychological machine to record\r\n\r\nthe  heart beats or the brain beats of a man to  test\r\n\r\nthis.  If  there  were, then we can  scrap  all  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  whether  it is  ten  years'  residence,\r\n\r\nwhether one speaks a certain language or whether  one\r\n\r\nswears   an  oath  of  allegiance  or  an   oath   of\r\n\r\nrenunciation.   You   can  go   through   all   these\r\n\r\nformalities and still have no loyalty to  a  country.\r\n\r\nThat is why every country is faced with this problem.\r\n\r\nThe test is really qualitative. But the law and human\r\n\r\nknowledge  do  not provide us with the  apparatus  to\r\n\r\nmeasure  the  mind and the heart. Hence the  law  has\r\n\r\ndevised  quantitative tests. One rule  of  the  thumb\r\n\r\nsays, \"If a person has been born and brought up in  a\r\n\r\nparticular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity  in a particular country, the  chances  are\r\n\r\nthat he is loyal to it, will live, fight and die  for\r\n\r\nit.\"  And  so  certain countries in this  world  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped in their laws the principle of jus soli - the\r\n\r\nright of citizenship by place of birth. It is because\r\n\r\nwe  are  part of the British Empire that we had  this\r\n\r\nparticular  system drafted into our laws. Whoever  by\r\n\r\nthe accident of his birth is born in any of the three\r\n\r\nSettlements in Malaya which in British legal  fiction\r\n\r\nwas  British territory, becomes a British-subject and\r\n\r\nenjoys the rights of a citizen but those born in  the\r\n\r\nProtected States, both the Federated Malay States and\r\n\r\nthe   Unfederated  Malay  States,  which  by  British\r\n\r\nconstitutional fiction were not British  territories,\r\n\r\ndid   not   automatically  acquire   the   right   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Our problem in Malaya is the  result  of\r\n\r\nBritish colonial policy in the last hundred years.  I\r\n\r\nam  not flogging a dead horse when I say this because\r\n\r\nI  think  one  of the greatest sins that the  British\r\n\r\ncolonial administration committed in this country was\r\n\r\nthat,  in their desire for rapid exploitation of  the\r\n\r\nnatural  resources  of  this  country,  they  had  no\r\n\r\nimmigration  policy  and  no  education  policy.  The\r\n\r\nresult  is that today the building of one nation  and\r\n\r\none  people is the most difficult of all tasks facing\r\n\r\nMalaya.  It has certainly created the most  acute  of\r\n\r\nproblems in the South-East Asia region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are other systems where\r\n\r\nthey do not measure loyalty by the accident of birth.\r\n\r\nThe  quantitative test of loyalty of the Germans  and\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese is whether the father is a German  or  a\r\n\r\nChinese.  If  a  German  gives  birth  to  a   child,\r\n\r\naccording to German and Chinese theory, he is  always\r\n\r\nfaithful to the fatherland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we in Singapore are now going to adopt as part\r\n\r\nof  our  legal system the theory that place of  birth\r\n\r\nensures loyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for better or for worse, we have to face the\r\n\r\nproblems  that  are existing. I ask  the  House  when\r\n\r\nconsidering  this Bill to remember that this  is  not\r\n\r\njust  a  question of electioneering,  of  whether  it\r\n\r\nshould be eighty years or eight years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  ten  years. Can we devise a quantitative test,  a\r\n\r\nrule  of thumb, which on the average, in the majority\r\n\r\nof  cases,  would mean that a man is  loyal  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry? That is the acid test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind this House by referring to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of  Malaya Constitutional  Proposals\r\n\r\n(No.  41  of 1957) where they have attempted to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  this  problem  of a large immigrant  population\r\n\r\nwhich  has  no political rights. It says in paragraph\r\n\r\n9:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is proposed to accept an amended form of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the Commission  with  regard  to\r\n\r\ncitizenship  by registration of persons  who,  though\r\n\r\nnot  born  in  the Federation, were resident  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation on Merdeka Day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first qualification is residence in the\r\n\r\nFederation on Merdeka Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"is recognised that those who have shown their\r\n\r\nloyalty  to  the Federation and have  made  it  their\r\n\r\npermanent  home should participate in the rights  and\r\n\r\nduties  of  citizenship. But  such  persons  will  in\r\n\r\neffect be obtaining citizenship by a process akin  to\r\n\r\nnaturalisation and it is therefore proposed that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should be in a position to exercise  some\r\n\r\ndiscretion  in  the  grant of  citizenship  to  them.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,  where  the  registration  authority  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied   that  an  applicant  has  the   necessary\r\n\r\nqualifications,  as  recommended by  the  Commission,\r\n\r\nthat  authority shall give notice to that  effect  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister appointed to exercise the functions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government of the Federation under Part  III  of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution; and unless the Minister  otherwise\r\n\r\ndirects  within such period as may be prescribed  the\r\n\r\nauthority shall register the applicant accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All countries all over the world have laws to deal\r\n\r\nwith persons who are not born part of a community but\r\n\r\nwho  would like to be part of a community and who  go\r\n\r\nthrough  a  process  by which they demonstrate  their\r\n\r\nunflinching  loyalty to the new community.  One  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  today  quoted the American  citizenship  laws\r\n\r\nwhich say that one has only to reside in America  for\r\n\r\nfive  years. I would like to remind that hon.  Member\r\n\r\nthat if he landed in Long Island he would wind up  in\r\n\r\nsome immigration warehouse and would be packed out of\r\n\r\nAmerica  in  a very short time. There is  already  an\r\n\r\nentrenched   and  established  community   and   that\r\n\r\ncommunity  sees  to  it that its  cohesiveness  as  a\r\n\r\nsocial and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncultural  group remains intact and secure before  the\r\n\r\nimmigrant is taken in and absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the British when they went round the world and\r\n\r\ncarved  out dominions for themselves, like the United\r\n\r\nStates  of  America which were once British colonies,\r\n\r\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand and even South Africa,\r\n\r\nsaw to it that they were \"the people\". This is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  thing.  You  must start  off  with  \"self\"\r\n\r\nbefore you can have \"self-government.\" There must  be\r\n\r\na  self. So the British when they enter a colony say,\r\n\r\n\"We  are  'the self'.\" Thereafter they say,  \"Whoever\r\n\r\nthey  may  be, even Hungarian heroes of  the  October\r\n\r\nrevolution  who became exiled from Hungary  after  an\r\n\r\nabortive  revolt,  they go to Australia  on  a  quota\r\n\r\nbasis. Then the Australian Government sees to it that\r\n\r\nthey  learn the Australian language (which  is  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent from the English language if one listens to\r\n\r\nit),  and  the  Australian  way  of  life.  They  are\r\n\r\nabsorbed  into an Australian community so that  there\r\n\r\nis  no  danger  of the Australian community  becoming\r\n\r\nsomething  different.\" So they did in  South  Africa,\r\n\r\nCanada  and  the United States. They carried  on  the\r\n\r\nBritish  tradition. Anybody who goes  to  the  United\r\n\r\nStates of America learns how to speak American, faces\r\n\r\nthe  American  flag - I do not know  whether  he  sings\r\n\r\n\"Stars  and  Stripes\"  or \"Star Spangled  Banner\" - and\r\n\r\ndemonstrates  his  loyalty  in  no  uncertain  terms,\r\n\r\nbefore  he  is digested into the American complex  of\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what happened in the British colonies? They in\r\n\r\ntheir arrogance thought that they were the world.  So\r\n\r\nlike  the  Romans,  they said,  \"We  will  coin  this\r\n\r\nconcept Pax-Britannica. The peace of Great Britain is\r\n\r\njust  like Pax-Romana, the peace of Rome.\"  And  they\r\n\r\nwho  were part of the subject people, not British  by\r\n\r\nbirth,  race,  origin or culture, but  British  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of conquest and conversion in mind - those  for\r\n\r\ninstance   who  converted  their  native   names   by\r\n\r\nacquiring Western initials in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder   to  convert  themselves  into  Europeans - were\r\n\r\naccorded  this privilege. That was what  the  British\r\n\r\nwanted to do and what in fact at the height of  their\r\n\r\npower  they did succeed in doing. When a person said,\r\n\r\n\"I  am  a British subject,\" he was like a man in  the\r\n\r\nold  days of Rome saying, \"I am a Roman citizen\"  and\r\n\r\nmust  be  treated differently from the other  natives\r\n\r\nwho are not Roman citizens. As a result of this, when\r\n\r\nthe  British went away from India to Burma, a lot  of\r\n\r\nIndians  went with them to Burma. When they  came  to\r\n\r\nMalaya,  a lot of Indians and British and  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nother  people  besides came to Malaya. In  the  early\r\n\r\ndays  when they introduced elections in 1948, we  saw\r\n\r\nall  these native expatriates claiming the  right  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  the  people  of  Singapore.  In  fact,   I\r\n\r\nremember  one who although not born in this  country,\r\n\r\nbecause  of her right as a British subject  succeeded\r\n\r\nin   becoming  a  representative  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. I am told that a warrant was later  issued\r\n\r\nfor  her  arrest because quite a large sum  of  money\r\n\r\nbelonging to local citizens was missing and  she  had\r\n\r\nabsconded back to the country of her origin. That was\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of lunacy that we had in this Colony.  For\r\n\r\ncheap  labour, they allowed unrestricted  immigration\r\n\r\nwithout any plan, without any policy and without  any\r\n\r\nintention  of creating or preserving the self.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  condemn the immigration as such, but  I  condemn\r\n\r\nthe Government which has no regard for the people  of\r\n\r\nthe  country  who have been assimilated and  did  not\r\n\r\nbother  to educate or to provide education for  those\r\n\r\ncoming  in.  Today,  with  the  renaissance  of   the\r\n\r\nmotherland   of   each  of  the   immigrant   groups,\r\n\r\nchauvinist  tendencies  are  incited.  Yet  at   this\r\n\r\ncritical   juncture  we  have  to  call  upon   these\r\n\r\nimmigrants  to  give  this  country  their  undivided\r\n\r\nloyalty.  But  that we must do because  there  is  no\r\n\r\nother way. Either we do that or we face a long period\r\n\r\nof   further  unrest,  more  unhappiness   and   more\r\n\r\ninstability.  Let us face the facts:  eventually  the\r\n\r\nobject  of  this  whole operation  is  to  build  one\r\n\r\npeople, and one nation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose object of their loyalty must be Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we did not achieve that when we went to London\r\n\r\nbecause  we  did not succeed in getting independence.\r\n\r\nWe  only got internal self-government, and hence  the\r\n\r\nrather quizzical remark of the Member for Tanglin. He\r\n\r\nasked, \"Why should there be this discretion to refuse\r\n\r\nto   afford   reciprocal   rights   to   Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries?\"   We   made  the   distinction   in   our\r\n\r\nproposals - and   the   distinction   is    not    made\r\n\r\nsufficiently  clear  in  the  Bill  itself - between  a\r\n\r\nFederation  citizen and a Commonwealth citizen.  This\r\n\r\nidea  of Commonwealth citizen is the product  of  the\r\n\r\n\"British  subject\" concept. As all these  independent\r\n\r\ncolonies   became  Dominions  they  had   their   own\r\n\r\ncitizenship laws but the British coined a new concept\r\n\r\n\"the   Commonwealth  citizen\".  Now  it  is  absolute\r\n\r\nnonsense  to  say that because you are a Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncitizen  you  can roam from one Dominion to  another.\r\n\r\nYou  cannot. If a Commonwealth citizen of India tries\r\n\r\nto  immigrate into the Dominion of Australia, he will\r\n\r\nfind that he is locked up in an immigration depot and\r\n\r\nsent back. Similarly if any Commonwealth citizen from\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  goes to Canada or to  Australia,  he\r\n\r\nwill  find  that his \"Commonwealth citizenship\"  does\r\n\r\nnot  entitle him to political rights in the other Dominions  within that Commonwealth. What has  happened\r\n\r\nis  that  all  these  countries have  developed  into\r\n\r\nnations  by  themselves and have  created  their  own\r\n\r\nnationality laws. It is only the British who wish  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on with this theory of Pax-Britannica  to  its\r\n\r\nlogical conclusions and still allow a person born  in\r\n\r\nBritain  or in any British colony an automatic  right\r\n\r\nof  entry  into  Britain. Now that, Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  will  remember, led to a lot  of  difficulties\r\n\r\nwhen  a  great  number of West Indians went  over  to\r\n\r\nBritain.  The British Government at one time  thought\r\n\r\nof  changing  the  laws  when they  found  that  this\r\n\r\nidealistic  concept  was going  to  militate  against\r\n\r\ntheir own working class. It was because of that  that\r\n\r\nwe  had  to make this concession: whereas a foreigner\r\n\r\nwishing to naturalise in Singapore would have to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the  ordinary naturalisation regulations,  a\r\n\r\nCommonwealth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizen need only stay here for two years. Now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  think it is monstrous that we should be asked  to\r\n\r\naccord  this privilege to Australians, South Africans\r\n\r\nand others who do not afford this privilege to us and\r\n\r\nwho  in  fact  would prevent us from  entering  their\r\n\r\ncountries.  Hence  the rider in this  Report  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Constitutional Conference held in London in\r\n\r\nMarch and April 1957 at paragraph 50 (d) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(d) citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies,\r\n\r\nand  other Commonwealth citizens, who had resided  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for a continuous period of not  less  than\r\n\r\ntwo  years, and whose application for citizenship  in\r\n\r\nthe  prescribed manner and form had been accepted  at\r\n\r\ntheir  discretion by the Government of Singapore.  In\r\n\r\ndetermining  whether for this purpose  a  person  had\r\n\r\nresided  in  Singapore for a continuous period,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  would  have  a  discretion  to\r\n\r\ndisregard periods of absence from Singapore which did\r\n\r\nnot appear to them to be inconsistent with continuity\r\n\r\nof  residence or loyalty to Singapore. In  exercising\r\n\r\ntheir  discretion [these are the operative words]  to\r\n\r\naccept  an application for citizenship the Government\r\n\r\nof Singapore would take into consideration whether or\r\n\r\nnot   the   Government  of  the  applicant's  country\r\n\r\nafforded  similar reciprocal rights  to  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the operative words. In fact, we did not\r\n\r\nwant  to  afford anybody such rights as we considered\r\n\r\nthis  fiction of the Commonwealth citizen  not  worth\r\n\r\npreserving. The Member for Tanglin will remember that\r\n\r\neven  a  man who has been called the most pro-British\r\n\r\nstatesman  in Asia, Perdana Mentri Persekutuan  Tanah\r\n\r\nMelayu  Tunku Abdul Rahman, went back to London  and\r\n\r\nrejected this proposal because he said, in Malaya, we\r\n\r\nhave  special  conditions and we cannot  accept  this\r\n\r\nidea of reciprocal citizenship.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

If  we  are  honest  about  merger  and  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  one  nation,  when  we  draw   up   our\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws, we must see where it is  going  to\r\n\r\ndovetail into the Federation citizenship laws because\r\n\r\nthe  moment  the principle of merger is  accepted  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  discuss the conditions for it. One  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  conditions that would have to be  settled  is:\r\n\r\nwho are the citizens of the Federation of Malaya?  If\r\n\r\nwe  draw  up  a list of rules making all  and  sundry\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore in a way which the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment    will   later   find    obnoxious    and\r\n\r\nunacceptable,  we  will be placing ourselves  in  the\r\n\r\nmost  difficult position of having to scrap all those\r\n\r\nwho have acquired Singapore citizenship and make them\r\n\r\napply anew for Federation citizenship. I do not  know\r\n\r\nif  the hon. elected Ministers on the other side have\r\n\r\nhad  the  opportunity or the desire to discuss  these\r\n\r\nmatters even informally on a purely speculative basis\r\n\r\nwith their colleagues in the Federation. But it would\r\n\r\nbe  most unfortunate if at a later stage when we have\r\n\r\nagreed  on principle to a merger and are working  out\r\n\r\nthe details, the Federation Government were to insist\r\n\r\non a completely new set of rules and a completely new\r\n\r\nregistration  for  citizens  of  the  Federation.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  say that this question of eight  years  or\r\n\r\nten  years  should  be  viewed  from  this  angle.  I\r\n\r\nappreciate the intensity of feeling of the Member for\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang (Mr Wong Foo Nam) which led to a  very\r\n\r\nimpassioned  speech  despite  his  loyalties  to  the\r\n\r\nAlliance.  The Minister for Education was wrong  when\r\n\r\nhe said that in the Federation you have to be born in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation and to reside eight years.  That  was\r\n\r\none  of the original proposals for discussion but the\r\n\r\nultimate   position   is  as   represented   in   the\r\n\r\nConstitutional Proposals which say - I have not got it,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir: I was told when  I  went  to  the\r\n\r\nlibrary  that it might be in the Chamber  itself  but\r\n\r\nthere were no amendments to these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposals  as  I  understand them:  but  I  would  be\r\n\r\nobliged if the Hon. the Chief Secretary would give me\r\n\r\nhis  copy. Article 17, and this is the Article  under\r\n\r\nwhich  subsequently  we will have  to  reconcile  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  our citizens who have not  been  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, reads:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to Article 18, any person of or over the\r\n\r\nage of eighteen years who was resident in the\r\n\r\nFederation on Merdeka Day,\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>First qualification: if you are out of the\r\n\r\nFederation on Merdeka Day you are out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"subject to the provisions of the Second Schedule,\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>which I shall come to later,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to be registered as a citizen upon making\r\n\r\napplication to the registration authority if he\r\n\r\nsatisfies that authority-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that he has resided in the Federation, during\r\n\r\nthe twelve years immediately preceding the date\r\n\r\nof the application, for periods amounting in the\r\n\r\naggregate to not less than eight years;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is correct: eight out of twelve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(b) that he intends to reside permanently\r\n\r\ntherein;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is also in accordance with ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(c) that he is of good character;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is also in accordance with ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) except where the application is made within\r\n\r\none  year after Merdeka Day and the applicant has\r\n\r\nattained the age of forty-five years at the  date\r\n\r\nof  the  application, that he has  an  elementary\r\n\r\nknowledge of the Malay language.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo  put it in simple language, it means that you have\r\n\r\nto  show  to the officer in charge that you  have  an\r\n\r\nelementary knowledge of the Malay language unless you\r\n\r\nare 45 years of age and you apply within one year. So\r\n\r\neven though you apply within one year and you are not\r\n\r\n45  years of age you go through that drill.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  authority on which the Member for Pasir  Panjang\r\n\r\nand  the Member for Serangoon are asking for revision\r\n\r\nfrom  ten  to eight. The Member for Pasir Panjang  at\r\n\r\nleast  I  must say is an honest man. In no  uncertain\r\n\r\nway he said that he was in favour of eight, years but\r\n\r\nthe Member for Serangoon in fact said, \"I am ready to\r\n\r\nbe seduced into changing my mind.\" He did not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay  that  he  wanted  to be seduced  but  he  issued\r\n\r\ninvitations  to  people  to make  representations  in\r\n\r\norder  that he can say, \"Alas, although I  agreed  to\r\n\r\nthis  White  Paper  and I signed this  Constitutional\r\n\r\nReport in London, what to do, I am a weak woman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> He is not here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> So much the more pity for him.\r\n\r\nBut  what  does our law say? It does not say anything\r\n\r\nabout language test which I think will be one of  the\r\n\r\ntricky  points later on with the Federation,  but  it\r\n\r\nsays  this: ten continuous years. Now, Sir,  when  we\r\n\r\namend  this  (if we amend this) let us bear  this  in\r\n\r\nmind. If the change we are going to make is going  to\r\n\r\nbring our laws more in line with the Federation  laws\r\n\r\nthen  on principle my Party supports it. If the  move\r\n\r\nwill make our laws more incongruous with the laws  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation,  my  Party  opposes  it.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nconsider the question of eight or ten years a  matter\r\n\r\nof  life  and  death  but  I  do  consider  that  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of congruity with the Federation's  laws  a\r\n\r\nmatter of great importance. I therefore suggest  that\r\n\r\nwhen the House appoints a Select Committee to go into\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  the  Select Committee will  accept  that\r\n\r\nprinciple.  I can understand the unhappiness  of  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Deputy Chief Minister; he has the right  to\r\n\r\ncall upon us to honour the bargain. We had all worked\r\n\r\nout a compromise in 1956. We reaffirmed our agreement\r\n\r\nto  the  compromise  in 1957 and for  anyone  of  the\r\n\r\nParties  to that agreement to back out on any  excuse\r\n\r\nor  pretext is most unfortunate. At the same  time  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to remind the Deputy Chief Minister  that\r\n\r\nif  the Federation is prepared to accept eight  years\r\n\r\nin  the  case of those who resided in the  Federation\r\n\r\nperhaps  he  may not be stretching the  point  if  he\r\n\r\nconceded  that  same  principle to  people  who  have\r\n\r\nresided in Singapore. But whatever it is, it would be\r\n\r\nin  the interest of everybody to try to sit down  and\r\n\r\nargue  this  thing out rationally in a friendly  way,\r\n\r\nkeeping  in mind the overriding principle of communal\r\n\r\nunity  and  solidarity, rather than  coming  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  to  make  electioneering  speeches  I  know\r\n\r\neverybody\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  in his mind the big question mark: how many  can\r\n\r\nmy  Party workers get registered and how many  can  I\r\n\r\nbring to the polls in my cars to vote for me? That is\r\n\r\npart  of  the process of electioneering but all  that\r\n\r\nsaid  and  done,  we have to run this  country  as  a\r\n\r\ncoherent  community. It is not  in  our  interest  to\r\n\r\nstart, like the Deputy Chief Minister has done, on  a\r\n\r\nvery   stiff  and  determined  stand,  or  like   his\r\n\r\ncolleague  in  the  Alliance, the  Member  for  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang,  to assail the proposals with such vehemence\r\n\r\nand  with  so  uncompromising  an  attitude.  We  can\r\n\r\nresolve this and I hope in Select Committee we  will,\r\n\r\nto the satisfaction of everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, this problem which the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon and his colleague the Member for Telok Ayer\r\n\r\nqueried - clause  22  of  the  Bill - the   question   of\r\n\r\ndeprivation  of  citizenship. Now I  can  excuse  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon because, unlike the subject  of\r\n\r\nboys'  clubs, he is not very conversant  with  this\r\n\r\nmatter. I know that he is an authority on boys' clubs\r\n\r\nand  I  know  that  he  does not  pretend  to  be  an\r\n\r\nauthority  on the laws of citizenship, but  I  cannot\r\n\r\nexcuse the Member for Paya Lebar (his colleague)  for\r\n\r\nallowing  him  deliberately to mislead  himself  into\r\n\r\nmisleading us and misleading the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nEvery  acquired citizenship in any part of the  world\r\n\r\nruns  the risk of termination. There is only one kind\r\n\r\nof  citizenship of which one cannot be  deprived  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  one  acquired by right of  birth.  This  is\r\n\r\nBritish   constitutional  theory.  There  are   other\r\n\r\ntheories,  I  think, where although you  are  born  a\r\n\r\ncitizen, you can still be deprived of it to make  you\r\n\r\na stateless person. But in British legal theory there\r\n\r\nis  only  one kind of citizenship of which  a  person\r\n\r\ncannot  be  deprived, namely, where you  are  born  a\r\n\r\nBritish subject. As a result of that, w, have to face\r\n\r\nup  to the fact that all acquired citizenships can be\r\n\r\nrevoked  and let us read what the Federation says  on\r\n\r\nthis question of termination of citizenship; this  is\r\n\r\nparagraph  11  of  the White Paper  No.  41  of  1957\r\n\r\n(Federation of Malaya):\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to drafting amendments, it is proposed to\r\n\r\naccept   all   the   main  recommendations   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitutional Commission with regard-to  termination\r\n\r\nof citizenship other than those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndealing  with  deprivation  on  the  acquisition   or\r\n\r\nexercise  of  citizenship of a foreign  country.  The\r\n\r\nCommission recommended that the Federation should  be\r\n\r\nentitled to protect itself against disloyalty of  any\r\n\r\ncitizen   who  either  voluntarily  acquires  foreign\r\n\r\ncitizenship or takes advantage of his being a foreign\r\n\r\ncitizen  under the law of his country of  origin.  It\r\n\r\nhas   been   agreed  that  this  recommendation,   if\r\n\r\naccepted,    together   with   the   other    related\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Commission would not give  the\r\n\r\nGovernment adequate powers to require that  undivided\r\n\r\nloyalty to the Federation which is considered  to  be\r\n\r\nso  vital  for  the future. It is therefore  proposed\r\n\r\nthat if the Government of the Federation is satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  any  citizen has at any time after Merdeka  Day\r\n\r\nacquired  by  registration, naturalisation  or  other\r\n\r\nvoluntary  and  formal act (other than marriage)  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  of  any country outside  the  Federation\r\n\r\n(i.e. including Commonwealth countries),\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which shows the Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) that\r\n\r\nthis  business  of  the Commonwealth  being  all  one\r\n\r\nfamily  sharing the same house is just nonsense!  The\r\n\r\noperative words are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the Government may by order deprive that person of\r\n\r\nhis  citizenship. It is further proposed that if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is satisfied that any citizen has  at  any\r\n\r\ntime  after  Merdeka  Day  voluntarily  claimed   and\r\n\r\nexercised  in a foreign country any rights  available\r\n\r\nto  him  under the law of that country, being  rights\r\n\r\naccorded  exclusively to its citizens the  Government\r\n\r\nmay  by order deprive that person of his citizenship.\r\n\r\nIt  has also been agreed that persons who have become\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens  or citizens of the  Federation  by\r\n\r\nregistration  or  naturalisation before  Merdeka  Day\r\n\r\nshould  be liable to be deprived of their citizenship\r\n\r\nunder the above provisions as if they had obtained it\r\n\r\nby registration or naturalisation after Merdeka Day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be honest about it then. There is no country\r\n\r\nanywhere  in  this world which gives  foreigners  the\r\n\r\nright  of  citizenship without that reservation  that\r\n\r\nthe  citizenship  can  be  terminated  under  certain\r\n\r\nconditions.  We can say that we must make  sure  that\r\n\r\nthe   citizenship  rights  are  not  arbitrarily   or\r\n\r\nunjustly terminated. We can provide machinery to  see\r\n\r\nthat  it  goes  before  some kind  of  quasi-judicial\r\n\r\ntribunal before the final administrative act or  even\r\n\r\nafter  the final administrative act. But deliberately\r\n\r\nto  allow  the  Member for Serangoon  to  expose  his\r\n\r\nignorance in order that we can all be misled is quite\r\n\r\nunfair  and  quite unworthy of the  Member  for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar.  In  spite of his many years in the  world  of\r\n\r\ncommerce and housing.

I\r\n\r\nsincerely hope that when we go to Select Committee we\r\n\r\nare not going to spend a long time haggling over what\r\n\r\nis  established constitutional practice. I would like\r\n\r\nto make our position quite clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think we will be deceiving the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore and deceiving ourselves if we believe  that\r\n\r\nby this act we have solved our problems. This is only\r\n\r\nthe  first step in the act. First, to those  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared to make this their home and be part  of  our\r\n\r\nnation, we take them in and afford them all political\r\n\r\nrights.  Then we give them all that goes  with  these\r\n\r\npolitical rights. It is only when you give  flesh  to\r\n\r\nthe  bones of a political constitution that  we  make\r\n\r\nloyalty a living reality. The British failed to  make\r\n\r\ntheir  Pax-Britannica a living reality  because  like\r\n\r\nthe  French  they  never believed in  it  themselves.\r\n\r\nFirst,  they  said, \"All those are citizens  who  are\r\n\r\nBritish   subjects,\"  and  then   with   a   lot   of\r\n\r\nhypocritical  legislation  they  distinguish  between\r\n\r\nBritish  subjects of U.K. origin and British subjects\r\n\r\nof non-U.K. origin. Many of us will remember the long\r\n\r\nyears before this whole myth exploded, the myth  that\r\n\r\nthose of U.K. origin were entitled by divine right to\r\n\r\nexpatriation pay, home leave, etc, and those  not  of\r\n\r\nU.K. origin were not entitled to these things. At one\r\n\r\nstage before the war, local British subjects were not\r\n\r\nentitled  to enter the same service. After  the  war,\r\n\r\nthey  were put in the same service but they were  not\r\n\r\nentitled  to certain other privileges. That  was  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  it failed, because it was not  practical\r\n\r\nand it was not made a living reality. The French have\r\n\r\ntried it: this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness   of  Algiers  being  part  of  metropolitan\r\n\r\nFrance. Nobody, not even the Frenchman, believes that\r\n\r\nbecause you are a French citizen therefore you  enjoy\r\n\r\nall the rights of a Frenchman. That is the reason why\r\n\r\nthe  whole  idea collapsed and failed.  We  must  not\r\n\r\nallow this to happen in Malaya. In Singapore we  have\r\n\r\nno  control  over the situation in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, but as a matter of plain common sense if  you\r\n\r\nsay to a man that he is a citizen of a country and he\r\n\r\nhas  got to bear all the obligations of a citizen but\r\n\r\nyou  do not afford him the same rights as every other\r\n\r\ncitizen  then  you  are  not going  to  inculcate  or\r\n\r\nstimulate  in him the undivided loyalty  which  other\r\n\r\ncitizens  who enjoy these privileges would  give.  In\r\n\r\nfact you cannot expect it from him. This is the first\r\n\r\nstep.  The  next  step is slowly to  integrate  these\r\n\r\npeople  who are going to register under our Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizenship  Ordinance into part of  the  society  of\r\n\r\nSingapore because only then can we make them part  of\r\n\r\n\"the  people\" and when we say the people we mean them\r\n\r\nand us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to\r\n\r\njoin  issue  with  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar's\r\n\r\nexposition  and  theories on the background  of  Pax-Britannica  or  his  ideas of  the  failings  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  citizenship law.

Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nindeed  very sad to see that this debate  on  a  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  was  drafted in accordance with  an  agreement\r\n\r\nreached  in  London  as  a  result  of  an  All-Party\r\n\r\ndelegation which got its powers from this Assembly in\r\n\r\nMarch last year has been turned into a play for party\r\n\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Members of the Liberal-Socialists which\r\n\r\nParty  has been hoping to be the ruling Party  during\r\n\r\nthe next election - God bless them-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

If we had wanted  to\r\n\r\nplay party politics, we could have boldly inserted in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill an eight-year residential qualification and\r\n\r\ntry   to  claim  that  it  was  a  decision  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. We do not wish to play party politics  in\r\n\r\na  matter  which has been the result of an  all-party\r\n\r\nunity.  We  would not have been successful in  London\r\n\r\nduring  our  negotiations if there had been  no  all-party  unity. I even said in my earlier speech,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat this was a Bill in which all Parties represented\r\n\r\nhad contributed towards it. We did not claim that  it\r\n\r\nwas  ours  and  ours  alone  although  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nactually  in discharge of an election pledge  of  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy), Sir,\r\n\r\nseems  to have the craze for early election.  Surely,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  Government  is  also  anxious  for  early\r\n\r\nelection  but it must not be forgotten that the  date\r\n\r\nof the general elections which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis the same date as that for the coming into force of\r\n\r\nthe  new constitution is governed by paragraph 54  in\r\n\r\nthe  agreement  signed  in London  by  the  All-Party\r\n\r\ndelegation.  Under this agreement, it  is  no  longer\r\n\r\nleft  to  the  Government to choose a  date  for  the\r\n\r\nelections  but it is to be left to this  Assembly  to\r\n\r\nmove  an Address to the Governor that it is time  for\r\n\r\ngeneral elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Sir, raised by Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition  has in part been answered by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar but as this Bill is going  to  be\r\n\r\ncommitted  to a Select Committee, feel that  all  the\r\n\r\npoints  raised that have not been answered  could  be\r\n\r\nanswered by the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Committal to Select Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 48, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  Mr  Speaker  as  Chairman  and   the\r\n\r\nfollowing as Members:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Yew Hock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Swee Kee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr E.

The Hon. the Chief Minister did mention to  me\r\n\r\nduring  the  luncheon adjournment that he wanted  the\r\n\r\nMembers of the last Constitutional Mission to  be  on\r\n\r\nthe Select Committee and two others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it would be in the interest of all if\r\n\r\nwe  enlarge  this Committee either  to  9  or  to  11\r\n\r\nbecause  my  Party  considers that  it  would  be  of\r\n\r\nadvantage  if there were two of us on this Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Government will understand that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  is a Bill to which all the communities are  most\r\n\r\nsensitive  and  I  would  like  to  propose,  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment agrees to the enlargement of the number of\r\n\r\npersons on the Select Committee, that the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang and one other gentleman of Indian origin be\r\n\r\nincluded in the Select Committee - not that we want  to\r\n\r\nbe   communalistic  about  this  but  in  order  that\r\n\r\neverybody in Singapore will understand that all views\r\n\r\nhave  been  represented and adequately heard  in  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee. It will be most unfortunate if when\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  comes  back  from Select  Committee  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  clauses recommitted for open debate  from\r\n\r\nwhich  a great deal of acrimony may arise. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how the Government feels about it. Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists may not like  the  idea  that  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party with only three members  should\r\n\r\nhave the same number of representatives on the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  as the Liberal-Socialist Party with  seven\r\n\r\nmembers - I am told that at any moment now there may be\r\n\r\neight  members as a result of the activities  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Telok Ayer. Be that as it may,  if  they\r\n\r\nwant  to have three as compared to P.A.P.'s two, well\r\n\r\nlet them have three. I say juggle the figures how  we\r\n\r\nwill  but let us make this a representative Committee\r\n\r\nso that nobody can say, \"We were not adequately heard\r\n\r\nor represented.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would appear then that the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar would be suggesting an amendment to\r\n\r\nthe  second part of the motion.
