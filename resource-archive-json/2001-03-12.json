Many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwere  involved in the one and a half years' effort to  define\r\n\r\nour  vision for the future and the House also spent two  days\r\n\r\ndebating  and  accepting the principles of  the  S21  vision.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  many  of us had high expectations of  how  the  S21\r\n\r\nvision  would  be implemented in an attempt  to  get  to  the\r\n\r\nideals  that  we define.  To many of us, the S21  vision  has\r\n\r\ntoday  been relegated to something like an on-going  courtesy\r\n\r\nor  keep  Singapore clean campaign.  We need  to  revive  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the many actions identified within the  S21\r\n\r\nvision that was developed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have done many things to achieve physical\r\n\r\nintegration of the various ethnic groups in Singapore through\r\n\r\npolicies  like  the  Housing  and Development  Board  housing\r\n\r\npolicies,  more  could  be done in  trying  to  achieve  true\r\n\r\nemotional integration or bonding amongst all races.  We  need\r\n\r\nto  urgently  build this bonding and trust among the  various\r\n\r\nraces   through  concrete  programmes  focused  on  emotional\r\n\r\nintegration.   This  is even more important  in  our  schools\r\n\r\nwhere children have the greatest opportunity to interact and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlearn  about  each  other.   Practices  in  some  schools  to\r\n\r\nsegregate  students  into  classes according  to  the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  option they study are very detrimental to our efforts\r\n\r\nto   integrate  Singaporeans.   Some  schools   do   it   for\r\n\r\nadministrative  convenience, but the convenience  is  causing\r\n\r\ntremendous damage with respect to building a cohesive  multi-racial Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ethnic-based self-help groups have achieved\r\n\r\nlimited   success,  but  much  needs  to  be   done.    While\r\n\r\nimprovements  have  been  made in  primary  schools,  in  the\r\n\r\nsecondary schools, problems still exist.  A higher proportion\r\n\r\nof Indians and Malays go to the Normal and Normal (Technical)\r\n\r\nstreams, as compared to the national average.  Performance of\r\n\r\nIndian and Malay students at the \"O\" and \"A\" levels also  did\r\n\r\nnot  significantly improve if we compare to the progress made\r\n\r\nby the Chinese community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue with the ethnic-based self-help groups\r\n\r\nis  that  we  intentionally segregate and  differentiate  our\r\n\r\nchildren according to the races when it comes to helping them\r\n\r\nto  improve  themselves.  We give our children the impression\r\n\r\nthat people of their own kind are the only ones who care  and\r\n\r\nwill  help  them.   For the smaller ethnic  groups  like  the\r\n\r\nIndians and the Eurasians, such an approach immediately  puts\r\n\r\nthem   at  a  disadvantage  simply  because  they  have  less\r\n\r\nresources to mobilise, especially in fund-raising, to support\r\n\r\ntheir  activities.  While each of them do  go  to  people  of\r\n\r\nother races for funds, the proportion of funds that come from\r\n\r\nother  races is very small, compared to the total  sums  that\r\n\r\nthey  collect.  Because of the lack of appropriate resources,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  limitation as to what they can do  and  to  the\r\n\r\nquality  of programmes that they can execute.  This, perhaps,\r\n\r\ncan  explain why the Indians and Malays still have a long way\r\n\r\nto go to catch up with the national average of performance at\r\n\r\nthe  landmark  examinations. This is a very dangerous  trend,\r\n\r\nespecially in the practice of meritocracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully believe in and support the meritocratic practice\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, but when such a practice is based on  academic\r\n\r\nperformance and when the ethnic minorities are the ones  that\r\n\r\nperform worse than the majority ethnic group, the result  may\r\n\r\nlead to a feeling of discrimination among the minorities when\r\n\r\nthey  are  not selected for key Government positions  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil service or in the uniformed service.  I therefore  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister to seriously consider restructuring  the\r\n\r\nethnic-based  self-help  group  concept  to  one  that   more\r\n\r\neffectively gives equal opportunities for improvement to  all\r\n\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about time that we merged the various ethnic-based\r\n\r\nself-help  groups  into one, or to create  an  umbrella  body\r\n\r\nwhich  oversees all the ethnic-based self-help  groups.   One\r\n\r\npossibility is to consolidate certain activities, like  fund-raising, administration and others that make sense from  each\r\n\r\nof  these groups, while keeping the operational arms of  each\r\n\r\ndiscrete.   I  concede that there will  be  more  success  in\r\n\r\nreaching  out  to  people  if this is  done  via  the  ethnic\r\n\r\ngrouping  route,  but  perhaps, it is only  this  portion  of\r\n\r\nreaching   out  that  should  be  kept  separate   while   we\r\n\r\nconsolidate the rest of the functions for the various groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I feel that the younger generation of leaders\r\n\r\nneeds  to  do  more  to have frank and open discussions  with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of all races, especially among the  leaders  and\r\n\r\nthe  minorities  in  Singapore, to understand  the  feelings,\r\n\r\nfrustrations and aspirations of each community so  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  be  better  understood and explained.   I  attended  the\r\n\r\ndialogue session that the Senior Minister held with the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity  about two weeks ago and could not help but  notice\r\n\r\nthe  trust  and respect those who were present  had  for  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister and his views.  It was years of  interaction\r\n\r\nand understanding and emotional bonding that made this happen\r\n\r\nand  possible.   Such things do not get developed  overnight.\r\n\r\nIt  takes many years and constant interaction to develop such\r\n\r\na  relationship.  I look forward to this happening  with  the\r\n\r\ncurrent and future generations of leadership so that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  trust  among the leaders and the members of the  various\r\n\r\nethnic groups and races can be built and strengthened upon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

But  this  is  certainly  a  delicate  task,\r\n\r\nespecially  as  some may feel that the two are  incompatible.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think  that  in  an ethnically diverse  society  like\r\n\r\nSingapore, it perhaps represents a pragmatic response to  the\r\n\r\nchallenge of nation-building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the hallmarks of this Government has been\r\n\r\nits  candid and forthrightness, both in its discussion of and\r\n\r\napproach to managing ethnic issues.  It does not shrink  away\r\n\r\nfrom  saying  it  as  it is, nor does it seek  a  politically\r\n\r\ncorrect veneer.  So we publish educational and socio-economic\r\n\r\ndata  by ethnic groups, have GRCs and the like, and some find\r\n\r\nthis  candour  inconvenient, if not a source  of  discomfort.\r\n\r\nBut  putting  it  out in the open offers our best  chance  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining a balanced and objective dialogue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, self-help groups are another example of this\r\n\r\nforthright approach.  They have been in existence  for  10-20\r\n\r\nyears  and  are  an essential part of Singapore's  landscape.\r\n\r\nThey  perform an important function in seeking to  raise  the\r\n\r\neducational  and  socio-economic status of the  disadvantaged\r\n\r\nwithin their respective communities.  It is easy to take them\r\n\r\nfor  granted and to overlook the fact however, that they  are\r\n\r\nethnic  in their focus and therefore are an anomaly of  sorts\r\n\r\nwithin multi-racial Singapore.  I was therefore glad that our\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  recently sounded  a  note  of  caution  lest\r\n\r\nSingaporeans misconstrue the Government's support  for  self-help groups as an endorsement for them to retreat into ethnic\r\n\r\nenclaves.   However, I was concerned by subsequent  reactions\r\n\r\nfrom the media that self-help groups should be merged and  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, has expressed similar views.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans and the media are right to be\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the  possible adverse impact  of  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  on Singapore's multi-racial character.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  are  wrong to conclude that therefore self-help  groups\r\n\r\nshould  be  abolished.  Self-help groups tap into  a  certain\r\n\r\nsense  of  mutual  help  within the  community  to  help  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged.  CDAC, Mendaki and SINDA have shown that  this\r\n\r\ncan  be a positive force for community upliftment and  if  we\r\n\r\nlook  at the statistics carefully, we will find that  in  all\r\n\r\nlevels,  there  has  been  an  improvement,  even  relatively\r\n\r\nspeaking, over the last 10 years or so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is always the risk that it can easily\r\n\r\ndegenerate  into an ugly form of parochialism  and  segmented\r\n\r\nthinking.  In  essence,  self-help  groups  operate  in   the\r\n\r\npenumbra  between  perfect integration on the  one  hand  and\r\n\r\nethnic  segregation  on the other.  But  does  that  mean  we\r\n\r\nabolish  them?  I think not.  Merging self-help  groups  will\r\n\r\nnot  guarantee  a  multi-racial utopia, yet,  we  would  deny\r\n\r\nourselves  an  effective vehicle to help  the  disadvantaged.\r\n\r\nBesides,  there  are hundreds of other clans,  religious  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  groups that will continue to exist that we  cannot\r\n\r\nand  we should not remove by Government fiat.  However, I  do\r\n\r\nbelieve Singaporeans are justified in wanting to know whether\r\n\r\nthere are measures in place to curb the possibility that self-help group activities might be inconsistent with our national\r\n\r\nobjectives.   This  is  especially so  given  that  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  receive  substantial support from Government  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  financial and other resources.  And it is important\r\n\r\nto  know  that these are applied in a manner consistent  with\r\n\r\nour overarching national objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in that regard, I would like to ask whether there\r\n\r\nis a case for an oversight or coordinating body for self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  under  the Prime Minister's Office, not  a  wholesale\r\n\r\nintegration,  but a body that can receive reports,  be  well-apprised  of the activities of the self-help groups  and  use\r\n\r\nmoral  suasion  on occasions when necessary.   I  think  this\r\n\r\nwould go a long way in reassuring Singaporeans that we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  these entities which serve a useful social purpose,  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  they  might, on occasions,  go  off  from  a\r\n\r\ntangent but that we have the measures in place to curb  those\r\n\r\ninstincts.  Apart from this audit function, I think the self-help  groups  themselves might welcome such an  oversight  or\r\n\r\ncoordinating body as it would serve as an important point  of\r\n\r\nliaison  between  them and the various Government  Ministries\r\n\r\nand  agencies in order to launch coordinated efforts targeted\r\n\r\nat specific issues within the communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Prime Minister's Office to comment on\r\n\r\nthis  and the Prime Minister to comment whether he feels that\r\n\r\nsuch a coordinating body is necessary and whether such a body\r\n\r\ncan then be set up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthere are Singaporeans who still wonder today why after  more\r\n\r\nthan  35 years of harmonious co-existence amongst the various\r\n\r\nraces,  the  recent  public discussions,  especially  on  the\r\n\r\nrecent  Malay-Muslim  issues, seem to  suggest  that  we  are\r\n\r\nhaving a more fragile state of race relations in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, I think, have been lulled into thinking these\r\n\r\nissues are mainly related to our past, the historical baggage\r\n\r\nthat  our  older  generation carries.  Younger  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nhowever,  must  be  aware  that  they  also  need  to  better\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  manage the diversity of race,  language  and\r\n\r\nreligion, not only in terms of our past experience,  but  how\r\n\r\nthey   will  handle  newer  issues  that  will  have   ethnic\r\n\r\nimplications  and how evolving geo-political  realities  will\r\n\r\naffect   us  in  ways  different  from  our  past.    Younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will have to find their own personal  relevance\r\n\r\nand  experience  and the meaning of racial harmony  in  their\r\n\r\neffort towards greater social integration.  I fear that  many\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans  do  not  understand  that  the  new  and\r\n\r\nemerging  issues  can be far more divisive and  serious  than\r\n\r\npast threats and challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People and groups are now better connected. Minority\r\n\r\ngroups  and racial and religious extremists can find  comfort\r\n\r\nand safety with groups elsewhere outside Singapore.  Already,\r\n\r\nwe  have seen how some domestic issues like education brought\r\n\r\nabout  reaction  from people outside Singapore.   What  about\r\n\r\nissues that are potentially more divisive?  For example, what\r\n\r\nif the digital divide that we talk about would also divide us\r\n\r\nalong  racial and ethnic lines?  What if a particular  ethnic\r\n\r\ncommunity  continues  to  feel  left  behind,  in  terms   of\r\n\r\neducation and other opportunities?  There have been  concerns\r\n\r\nabout stereotyping of minority groups on radio and TV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard how and certainly felt very uneasy during\r\n\r\nrecent   talks   of   marginalisation  of  the   Malay-Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity.  There were concerns of discrimination in the past\r\n\r\nfaced  by  job-seekers,  or of older Malay-Muslims  who  feel\r\n\r\nespecially  vulnerable as they face future structural  change\r\n\r\nin employment. These are extremely explosive issues which can\r\n\r\nbe  manipulated.  Some countries like UK have race  relations\r\n\r\nActs  to deal with such discrimination on racial grounds.  It\r\n\r\nprovides  for  avenues  where people who  feel  aggrieved  or\r\n\r\ndiscriminated  by  employers,  for  example,  can   get   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  protection. It provides for a Code of Practice  to\r\n\r\nensure equality of opportunities in employment and education.\r\n\r\nIt  gives  powers to investigate and provide for  enforcement\r\n\r\nand   prosecution  of  offenders.   Other  than   the   legal\r\n\r\nframework,  it  deals with how, for example,  newspapers  and\r\n\r\nmagazines can reflect the diversity of arts, culture, even in\r\n\r\npromotional advertising.  But, Sir, I am not suggesting  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  a Race Relations Act in Singapore, because I  think\r\n\r\nnothing can be more damaging than to have such emotive issues\r\n\r\nbeing   contested  in  court.   So  far,  we  have   existing\r\n\r\nmechanisms  to deal with such issues, and mainly through  the\r\n\r\ngoodwill  of  our community and political leaders.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  essence  of  these  provisions  found  in  the  UK  Race\r\n\r\nRelations Act, I think, is useful to us, because we  need  to\r\n\r\nfind new mechanisms to handle this in a more transparent way.\r\n\r\nAnd I repeat the call for setting up of a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  agency,  perhaps  under  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice,  to deal with issues like this.  Or it can be through\r\n\r\nthe  Presidential Councils for Religious Harmony and Minority\r\n\r\nRights, which can be enlarged and strengthened to take a more\r\n\r\nproactive stand towards racial integration.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, it is good to hear the various community\r\n\r\norganisations responding, saying that they will  do  more  to\r\n\r\nenhance racial and ethnic activities.  But it is one thing to\r\n\r\nhave an agency like this to monitor and ensure that the state\r\n\r\nof  race  relations  in Singapore continues  to  remain  very\r\n\r\nhealthy,  very  much  like what the People's  Association  is\r\n\r\ndoing  to  ensure that community centres do actually organise\r\n\r\nsuch activities, and perhaps penalise  those who do not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such organisations, we can ensure that channels for\r\n\r\nracial integration are always there and adequately protected.\r\n\r\nWe   can   have   national  education   programmes   in   our\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods   -   in  schools and  in  workplaces   -   to\r\n\r\nmobilise participation of all Singaporeans.  The multi-racial\r\n\r\nagency can also be a body to manage the various accommodation\r\n\r\nand  compromises  that are necessary as  we  proceed  towards\r\n\r\nracial  integration.   It  is necessary  to  deal  with  such\r\n\r\nissues,  because  people who promote culture,  tradition  and\r\n\r\nsometimes religion have a missionary evangelical zeal towards\r\n\r\ntheir own culture and tradition, and makes accommodation  and\r\n\r\ncompromise very difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, our cultural diversities, including the\r\n\r\nrole  of  ethnic  and minority groups, are factors  which,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, have and will continue to enrich and strengthen  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  both in culture, politics and economic  prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut  there  is  no  doubt that this very diversity  can  also\r\n\r\nbecome  a  very  weak factor, and become a threat  to  social\r\n\r\nstability in Singapore.  And it is for these reasons, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthought  that  greater  attention should  be  given  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I want to join\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  raised concerns that  race-based  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups may inadvertently lead to segregation.  Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  has recently encouraged them to work together.  I  think\r\n\r\nwe  all  stand, in that sense, between these two extremes  of\r\n\r\nsegregation on the one hand, and merger on the other. And  we\r\n\r\nare seeking ways, like the speakers before me, of how to help\r\n\r\nthese  separate  entities become more  cooperative,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  have the conviction about their own ethnicity, but also\r\n\r\nthe willingness and understanding to compromise when need be.\r\n\r\nSo I want to focus on how we can offer incentives rather than\r\n\r\nmerely exhortations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first suggestion I have for the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice   is   that  the  Government  should   give   funding.\r\n\r\nGovernment already funds dollar-for-dollar schemes  for  most\r\n\r\nof   the   self-help   groups.   To  encourage   multi-racial\r\n\r\ncooperation, Government should establish a new and additional\r\n\r\nfund.   And where two or more self-help groups work  together\r\n\r\nfor  programmes and events, this new fund would give them  an\r\n\r\nextra dollar to match the expenses.  In this sense, we should\r\n\r\ncreate  financial  incentives to  help  them  work  together.\r\n\r\nExhortation   works   by   moral  suasion,   but   I   think,\r\n\r\nadditionally,  practical  measures  to  work   together   are\r\n\r\nimportant,  because  cooperation does  take  more  time.   It\r\n\r\nsometimes  is  more  costly to cooperate  because  there  are\r\n\r\nmeetings, more administration, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is to encourage people outside of\r\n\r\na  racial group to help.  They can already give funds to that\r\n\r\ngroup, ie, if I am Chinese, there is nothing to stop me  from\r\n\r\npledging  part  of  my CPF, etc, to another  racial  group  - Indian,  Eurasian or Malay.  I think more should be  done  to\r\n\r\nencourage  this  and perhaps Government  should  give  a  tax\r\n\r\nbenefit to encourage this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion I have is one of oversight. Some\r\n\r\nhave suggested that oversight be from outside, from the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office.  My suggestion is that oversight should be\r\n\r\nfrom the inside.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment should encourage self-help groups to appoint  more\r\n\r\nmembers  of  other  races to their boards  of  directors  and\r\n\r\nadvisors.    These  people,  of  course,   should   have   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding and empathy of the particular ethnic group, but\r\n\r\nthey will be also able to bring in some other perspectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, Sir, some would urge Government to\r\n\r\nconsider setting a sunset clause to the self-help groups.   I\r\n\r\nthink  there is some sense to think about this, because while\r\n\r\nthere  will always be people in Singapore who need our  help,\r\n\r\nif  our multi-racial efforts succeed over time, all of us  as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will be able to help them.  Perhaps that is  the\r\n\r\nview  for  the  longer term, but I think it is  important  to\r\n\r\nprepare for that by step-by-step efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Government will consider these\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave  been successful over the years in raising the  standard\r\n\r\nof  living of most Singaporeans.  In fact, it has become  the\r\n\r\nenvy  of  many nations around us.  However, in our relentless\r\n\r\npursuit, like many developed nations, we will have to grapple\r\n\r\nwith  issues such as widening income gap between  the  higher\r\n\r\nincome group, the rich, and the lower income group, the poor.\r\n\r\nThis  phenomenon will be further accelerated by our open door\r\n\r\npolicy  to investments, inflow of foreign talents and today's\r\n\r\nInternet-driven  economy.  They call  it  the  great  digital\r\n\r\ndivide.  This digital divide is a serious problem.  Those who\r\n\r\ncan  capitalise  on the growth of the Internet  economy  will\r\n\r\nbenefit immensely, whilst those still lagging behind  in  the\r\n\r\nold  economy  will  suffer the fate of  dwindling  income  or\r\n\r\nstagnation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike developed nations with vast resources, our prized\r\n\r\nasset  is our human resource as our capital.  We are  only  a\r\n\r\nred  dot  on  the map.  We know that we cannot  and  are  not\r\n\r\ncapable  of reversing this international trend.  As  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry, we cannot afford social disorder and a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncollapse  within our social fabric.  Therefore,  we  place  a\r\n\r\nhigh  premium in ensuring our social cohesion, racial harmony\r\n\r\nand integration among the various races,  and unity among our\r\n\r\npeople.  Like our world-class infrastructure, social cohesion\r\n\r\ncan  be  ranked  as  one  of our key pillars  supporting  our\r\n\r\ncontinued  competitiveness and survival in today's globalised\r\n\r\neconomy.  As such, the great digital and income divide  issue\r\n\r\nhas to be addressed with great care and sensitivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we continue our drive to attract the best\r\n\r\ninvestments and talents to Singapore, those who are unable to\r\n\r\nkeep  pace with this drive should not be left behind to  fend\r\n\r\nfor  themselves,  or made to feel severely  handicapped.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  I  am not suggesting in any way that we should  give\r\n\r\nhand-outs  and welfare to those who are unable  to  make  the\r\n\r\nleap.  We  must acknowledge that despite all our  efforts  to\r\n\r\nmotivate and encourage fellow Singaporeans to upgrade,  there\r\n\r\nwill  always be a group who will find it difficult or  unable\r\n\r\nto  cope.   This group of people will continue  to  earn  low\r\n\r\nwages,  while the rest will ride the Internet wave  and  earn\r\n\r\ngood wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our meritocratic system has served us well. The good\r\n\r\nand  the  able will be rewarded handsomely, whilst  the  less\r\n\r\nable  will  be treated fairly.  It is precisely in this  area\r\n\r\nthat our Government should continue to play a proactive role.\r\n\r\nWhile  we cannot and should not arbitrarily manage and bridge\r\n\r\nthe  widening income gap, we can offer other means  to  level\r\n\r\nup.   Over  the  years, the Government has been  generous  by\r\n\r\noffering periodic CPF top-ups for the lower income groups and\r\n\r\nthe  aged,  and  asset  enhancement through  shares,  Edusave\r\n\r\nscholarships, etc,  all in an attempt to ensure that the less\r\n\r\nprivileged  and the lower income family will feel  and  enjoy\r\n\r\nalso  the fruits of our success.  These are good schemes  and\r\n\r\nshould   be   encouraged,  continued,  and  more  should   be\r\n\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I must stress that ensuring our social\r\n\r\ncohesion  goes beyond just providing occasional  CPF  top-ups\r\n\r\nor, in simple terms, material benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese  are  not enough.  Lower income and the less privileged\r\n\r\ngroups, which may grow in numbers, should not be left to feel\r\n\r\nthat  they have been deprived or, worse still, unable to gain\r\n\r\naccess  to certain basic amenities due to their inability  to\r\n\r\nafford the cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this respect that our Government has a pivotal\r\n\r\nrole  to  play.   The provision of basic amenities,  such  as\r\n\r\nmedical  healthcare  services,  housing,  education,   public\r\n\r\nfacilities  like parks, playgrounds, etc, should serve  as  a\r\n\r\nmeans  in  bridging  the income gap.  We should  continue  to\r\n\r\nleverage  on providing such basic facilities at an affordable\r\n\r\nrate  and  make it accessible to every Singaporean regardless\r\n\r\nof   their  status  in  our  society.   Ensuring  that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  has  ready  access to  each  of  these  services\r\n\r\nregardless of race, religion and their position in society is\r\n\r\nthe  only  way  to  create  a level  playing  field  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on the identity crisis - my role\r\n\r\nas a Singaporean.  Our Government has always been mindful and\r\n\r\nsensitive in devising our policies and approaches.  Many good\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and schemes, such as making funds  available  for\r\n\r\nskills  training, asset enhancement, CPF top-up,  rebates  on\r\n\r\nutilities charges, etc, have been initiated over the years by\r\n\r\nthe Government in an effort to \"level up\" our society and  to\r\n\r\nshare  the  fruits of success.  While such schemes should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged,  should we not be mindful of the ill effect  they\r\n\r\nmay  impose  on  Singaporeans, especially on  items  such  as\r\n\r\nrebates  and CPF top-up?  In fact, many have taken these  for\r\n\r\ngranted and that they no longer consider them as a privilege.\r\n\r\nWhat  if  our  economy turns bad?  What  will  happen?   Will\r\n\r\nSingaporeans still expect to receive their privileges?   What\r\n\r\nhappens if they do not receive?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey on younger Singaporeans revealed that\r\n\r\ntheir pragmatism and lack of passion for Singapore will  make\r\n\r\nthem  leave  Singapore  for  greener  pastures  without   any\r\n\r\nhesitation.  Despite our efforts over the years  to  build  a\r\n\r\ncohesive  and  unified society through  various  schemes  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes, there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  still  pockets  of Singaporeans who feel  otherwise,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  younger group.  Not only have  they  become\r\n\r\nmaterialistic, they have come to expect what Singapore should\r\n\r\noffer  them,  rather than how they could  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  the  society and country.  Are  they  wrong?   We\r\n\r\ncannot  really say so.  One of the key points to note is  the\r\n\r\nsense  that they have nothing to do with the achievements  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They felt that they could do very little or  they\r\n\r\nhave  no  role to play.  This is a real concern because  many\r\n\r\nperhaps have taken the good and high standard of living  that\r\n\r\nthey  enjoy now as their right and entitlement, instead of  a\r\n\r\nprivilege.  Their better education and our open economy  have\r\n\r\nenabled   the   younger   generation  unlimited   access   to\r\n\r\ninformation  of  the  world.  This has perhaps  shaped  their\r\n\r\nthinking and created high aspiration and expectation.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 has set out a grand vision for every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  in which everyone of us has a role  to  play  in\r\n\r\nsustaining and ensuring our success and survival.   It  is  a\r\n\r\npity  that  after its grand introduction, somehow the  vision\r\n\r\nhas  been  forgotten.   While it is  important  to  emphasise\r\n\r\neconomic  success,  we  should  also  not  forget  the   very\r\n\r\nfundamental values of society and family.  It is these values\r\n\r\nthat  will bind our people together in a crisis and to  carry\r\n\r\nour nation through thick and thin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, we can see such feelings and emotions of\r\n\r\ntogetherness and closing of ranks among Singaporeans when  we\r\n\r\ndeal  with issues such as the SQ 006 crash and the occasional\r\n\r\nbashing  from Malaysia.  We can see such feelings and passion\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore.   However,  for us  to  continue  to  achieve\r\n\r\neconomic  success,  such  value system  of  togetherness  and\r\n\r\nbonding  must  be  deeply ingrained in every Singaporean,  so\r\n\r\nthat we can ride out the challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have a cut\r\n\r\nwhich  I have just missed.

The statistics cited  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   showed   that  Malay  children   not   only   make\r\n\r\nimprovements  in both the Primary School Leaving Examinations\r\n\r\nbut  also  the secondary school examinations, and  also  more\r\n\r\nMalays  are  getting  admitted  to  both  secondary  schools,\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and the universities.  As for occupations,  the\r\n\r\nMalays  are  also  getting more managerial  and  professional\r\n\r\njobs.   The percentage increase in those jobs is from 12%  to\r\n\r\n23%  over the period of 1990 to 2000.  Incomes of the  Malays\r\n\r\nhave  also shown an equal increase.  For the median  resident\r\n\r\nMalay  household incomes, the increase from 1990 to 2000  was\r\n\r\n$1,800 to about $2,700.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After PM Goh's speech, the Malay MPs in Parliament were\r\n\r\nquick  to  point  out that the Malays in  Singapore  are  not\r\n\r\nmarginalised and the meritocracy system does not work against\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  community.   I agree with the  Malay  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.  While we laud the progress made by the Malays in\r\n\r\nSingapore in the areas mentioned above, there are other areas\r\n\r\nin  which the Malays are not particularly happy and they want\r\n\r\nthem  changed.  The Malays in Singapore want to be integrated\r\n\r\nwith the other communities.  They do not want to be isolated,\r\n\r\nlike  in the self-help groups.  Also, they want to be treated\r\n\r\nlike  other  Singaporeans.  They  say  that  they  are  loyal\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  want to be accepted in the  Singapore  Air\r\n\r\nForce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay youths today have to do national service, just\r\n\r\nlike  any  other Singaporean youths.  But they  can  only  do\r\n\r\nnational service in the Army, Navy and Police\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nForce, but not in the Singapore Air Force.  If this is  true,\r\n\r\nI  would like to know why.  I would think that members of the\r\n\r\nMalay  community  should be allowed to do  their  NS  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Air  Force as well as the other  branches  of  the\r\n\r\narmed services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of Special Assistance Plan Schools is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  also causes discomfort  to  the  Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I think that the Government should take  note  of\r\n\r\nthat  and  have  another look at the SAP schools.   When  our\r\n\r\nMalay brethrens say that they want to be integrated into  the\r\n\r\nother  communities, I believe that they do  not  want  to  be\r\n\r\nbranded as an ethnic group or a minority group.  While it  is\r\n\r\ntrue that they comprise only 15% to 18% of our population,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  they  do not want to be treated as  a  separate  and\r\n\r\ndistinct  ethnic group.  Each Malay wants to  be  treated  as\r\n\r\njust another Singaporean.  Each Malay today wants only to  be\r\n\r\nknown  as  a  Singaporean and not as a Malay Singaporean.   I\r\n\r\nthink that the Government should take note of what they want.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore is to become a truly multi-racial country,\r\n\r\nthen  we  should  at  least listen to our Malay  brothers  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of their problems concerning their integration  into\r\n\r\nthe  other  communities and their other problems,  and  their\r\n\r\nplea  for  acceptance in the Singapore Air Force.   I  should\r\n\r\nalso add that the formation of the GRC is an identity problem\r\n\r\nto  both  the  Malays and the Indians where they are  forever\r\n\r\nbranded  as  ethnic races.  The Malays have come a  long  way\r\n\r\nsince  Singapore's independence in 1965 and  I  believe  they\r\n\r\nwant  to move along together with the mainstream Singaporeans\r\n\r\nas Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take my next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Singapore is basically a good place\r\n\r\nfor  business.   The  Government has put  in  place  all  the\r\n\r\nnecessary infrastructure - the hardware, so to say.  We  have\r\n\r\nbuildings for offices, buildings for factories, buildings for\r\n\r\nschools and hospitals, and a good network of road system  and\r\n\r\nother facilities.  All these things are necessary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  foreigners to come to invest their money here and  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness and give Singapore economic growth every year.   All\r\n\r\nthe  things  are  of  course necessary  in  nation  building.\r\n\r\nWithout food, clothing, housing, hospitals, schools, there is\r\n\r\nnothing  to  talk  about  nation  building.   Singapore   has\r\n\r\nachieved much in terms of physical infrastructure, in  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding,  but  rather lacking in the  software  part  -  the\r\n\r\nemotions that Singaporeans can identify with Singapore.  Many\r\n\r\nof  the young people recently interviewed find it hard to say\r\n\r\nthat  they can be proud to be a Singaporean.  They appear  to\r\n\r\nhave no emotional attachments to Singapore. Emotionally, they\r\n\r\ncannot relate to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from my own experience, when I came back from\r\n\r\noverseas,  I  felt  a strong emotion for  Singapore,  and  of\r\n\r\ncourse also to see my parents, and I longed to see the places\r\n\r\nwhich  were very familiar to me during my childhood days.   I\r\n\r\nwas  saddened to see that my old house, which I had lived for\r\n\r\nmany  years as a child, had been sold and pulled down by  the\r\n\r\ndevelopers, and it was no longer there.  I had lived  in  the\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road area as a boy.  The old wet market there  which\r\n\r\nwas  so  familiar had been torn down.  As a boy I also cycled\r\n\r\nwith other friends to eat ice kachang at the shop behind  the\r\n\r\nwet  market.  That shop and all the rows of shophouses  along\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road  had been demolished to give way  to  high-rise\r\n\r\nshopping centres.  The picture of Singapore I knew as  a  boy\r\n\r\nhad all disappeared.  I think this must be the experiences of\r\n\r\nmany other Singaporeans.  So, emotionally, if this is not the\r\n\r\npicture  that  I had in my mind as a child, it  is  certainly\r\n\r\nhard  to  relate  to that place.  It is just like  any  other\r\n\r\nplace in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore is to have democracy, I think more people\r\n\r\nshould  be  allowed  to take part in politics.   I  say  this\r\n\r\nbecause of the youngsters interviewed, one said that he could\r\n\r\nnot relate to the beautiful airport that was built at Changi,\r\n\r\nbecause he said that he did not have a say in the building of\r\n\r\nthat  airport or had nothing to do with the building  of  the\r\n\r\nairport.   My point is that Singaporeans should  be  given  a\r\n\r\nchance to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake  part in politics.  As it is, even if they want to  take\r\n\r\npart in politics, it is becoming more and more difficult.  We\r\n\r\nhave  very high deposits and we also have the GRCs which make\r\n\r\nit  almost  impossible  for  Singaporeans  to  take  part  in\r\n\r\npolitics and have a say in what is going on in the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the landscape, Singapore is developing so rapidly\r\n\r\nthat now we cannot use the landscape to create emotional ties\r\n\r\nwith  the  country.  The old buildings that we know  so  well\r\n\r\nhave all been torn down and made way for so-called progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, Mr Chiam. The time allocated to\r\n\r\nyou has expired.  General Lee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  first  take  all the points made on  racial  harmony,\r\n\r\nmultiracialism and self-help groups, and then  address  later\r\n\r\nthe   issues  about  Singapore  identity,  which  was  raised\r\n\r\nespecially by Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Chiam See Tong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the MPs for sharing their concerns\r\n\r\nabout the need for self-help groups to look beyond their  own\r\n\r\ncommunities and to collaborate more with one another.  And  I\r\n\r\nalso thank them for the suggestions they have given us on how\r\n\r\nthis can be achieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should see this problem in our basic context\r\n\r\nand  begin with our basic ideal, namely, that we are  seeking\r\n\r\nto   build   an   integrated,  multi-racial,  multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety.   That  is what we set out to do in nation  building\r\n\r\nand  self-help groups fit into this context.   When  we  talk\r\n\r\nabout  nation  building, we try to  do  it  by  many  ways  - integrated  HDB  housing  estates,  so  all  the  races  live\r\n\r\ntogether;  national  schools,  common  curriculum;   national\r\n\r\neducation in schools so that people know Singapore's  history\r\n\r\nand  our strategic circumstances; the pledge said every  day,\r\n\r\nthe  flag-raising,  and  so  on.  And  the  schools  organise\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  teach pupils how to appreciate  and  live  in\r\n\r\nharmony  with  each  other through actual  participation  and\r\n\r\nexperience.   Pupils  from different  schools  do  activities\r\n\r\njointly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntogether.    Pupils   take  part  in  community   involvement\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  and so they mix with others of different  races,\r\n\r\nand  in mixing, get to know one another and get to appreciate\r\n\r\none another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, as we talk about bringing the\r\n\r\nethnic  groups together, we also want the young  to  grow  up\r\n\r\nwith  a  sense  of their cultural heritage and  their  mother\r\n\r\ntongues, and every ethnic group wants to keep something which\r\n\r\nis  of  itself.  When Mr Chiam says Malay Singaporeans prefer\r\n\r\nto   be   known   as  Singaporeans  rather  than   as   Malay\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, I saw Mr Zulkifli smiling at that.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  Mr  Chiam's reading of the ground is accurate.   Every\r\n\r\nSingaporean wants to be both - to keep something  of  himself\r\n\r\nand  his  ethnic  group, at the same time to  have  something\r\n\r\nwhich is shared with all the communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in schools, in order to help people keep some of\r\n\r\ntheir  own cultural identity, we focus on teaching the mother\r\n\r\ntongue.   We  cannot  teach the mother tongue  in  integrated\r\n\r\nclasses.  But that does not mean we have to segregate  pupils\r\n\r\nby race into different classes for all subjects, just for the\r\n\r\nconvenience of teaching the mother tongue.  Mr Inderjit Singh\r\n\r\nraised  this concern, but it is an old administrative  issue,\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry  of  Education has actually  resolved  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  And they have told all the principals who know that\r\n\r\nthey  must  not, out of administrative expediency,  segregate\r\n\r\nthe  pupils  based  on the mother tongue  classes.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  all the Malay pupils in one class because  you  study\r\n\r\nMalay,  all the Chinese group also in another class,  and  so\r\n\r\non.   Once  in  a while, there is a case which comes  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's notice, then the principal is reminded of this and\r\n\r\nis  asked  to  put the situation right.  So  that  is  a  not\r\n\r\nserious  problem.   In general, the schools  try  to  arrange\r\n\r\ncommon  mother tongue periods, where possible, so the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  periods  will all coincide and, at  that  point,  the\r\n\r\npupils   attend  their  various  mother  tongue  lessons   in\r\n\r\ndifferent  classes at the same time.  And  this  reduces  the\r\n\r\nneed for segregating pupils.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we pursue the ideal of an integrated society,\r\n\r\nwe   must  also  acknowledge  that  we  are  not  yet   fully\r\n\r\nintegrated.   If  we want to seriously tackle certain  social\r\n\r\nproblems,  for  example,  broken  families,  drugs,   teenage\r\n\r\ndelinquency,   or school under performance, then  an  ethnic-based community self-help approach is really a practical  and\r\n\r\neffective way for several reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The motivation to help members of one's own\r\n\r\ncommunity  is a very strong and natural one, which we  should\r\n\r\nharness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It is important for the self pride of the\r\n\r\ncommunities.  It is important that they feel they are  making\r\n\r\nprogress   through  their  own  efforts,  and  not  passively\r\n\r\nreceiving aid from others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is sensitivity doing social work across racial\r\n\r\nlines.   It  is not so difficult to motivate volunteers  from\r\n\r\none  race  to  tutor  children from  another  race.   We  can\r\n\r\npersuade  them.   There will be some who are idealistic,  who\r\n\r\nwill  come forward and they will do that, and some are  doing\r\n\r\nthat.   Much more delicate is to have, say, an Indian  social\r\n\r\nworker exhorting and pressuring Chinese or Malay men to  take\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for their families.  Families have  problems,\r\n\r\nparents  not carrying out their duties, or head of  household\r\n\r\nnot  carrying  out  his duties.  You need encouragement,  you\r\n\r\nneed  support, you need counselling, and sometimes, you  need\r\n\r\nfirm  words  from  somebody whom he respects  and  identifies\r\n\r\nwith.   And if you cross racial lines in doing such sensitive\r\n\r\nwork, we can easily cause offence and misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we set up the self-help groups, like SINDA,\r\n\r\nCDAC,  Mendaki  and AMP.  As long as these  groups  focus  on\r\n\r\nsocial  and  community  work,  they  are  making  a  valuable\r\n\r\ncontribution.   But  if  they stray  beyond  that  to  assert\r\n\r\nthemselves politically, on a racial basis, that threatens the\r\n\r\nbasic  foundation  of  our social  compact  and  it  must  be\r\n\r\nchecked.  And MPs are quite right to point out that this is a\r\n\r\ndanger  which we should guard against.  This was one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons why the Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntook a strong stand to oppose the AMP's collective leadership\r\n\r\nproposal recently.  Because we felt it strayed beyond  social\r\n\r\nand  community work to venture into the political arena,  and\r\n\r\nnot  just  politics,  but multi-racial  politics,  going  for\r\n\r\nracial politics dividing Singapore along ethnic lines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the self-help groups do their own activities, we\r\n\r\nalso  encourage them to come together and reach out to  other\r\n\r\ncommunities.  In fact, they are already doing this. They have\r\n\r\ngot  donors  and  volunteers from other racial  groups.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  14%  of  Mendaki's donations come from  non-Malays.\r\n\r\nAnd we have got volunteers in Mendaki, 11%; SINDA, 10%; CDAC,\r\n\r\n9%; AMP, 14%, volunteers from other races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the self-help groups organise joint programmes\r\n\r\nwhich  they  open to members of other groups, and  they  open\r\n\r\ntheir  own  programmes  to members of  other  groups.   These\r\n\r\ninclude tuition programmes and joint training programmes  for\r\n\r\ntutors.  They  run an annual Camp Teen for  youths  from  all\r\n\r\nethnic  communities.  Camp Teen is spearheaded by each  group\r\n\r\non  a  rotation basis to promote cross-cultural  interaction,\r\n\r\nenhance  understanding of each other and instill values  like\r\n\r\nteamwork.   And  the self-help groups also participate  in  a\r\n\r\nlarger network of community organisations, including the CDCs\r\n\r\nand  voluntary welfare organisations.  For example, the  five\r\n\r\nof  them  get together and they run the Joint Social  Service\r\n\r\nCentre,  five  of  them plus the Central Singapore  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Council, I think it is in Toa Payoh,  which  was\r\n\r\nformed  in  1997  and has been providing family  and  student\r\n\r\nservices since December last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to continue to encourage these outreach\r\n\r\nactivities which will go some way to prevent individual self-help  groups from becoming inward-looking, racist groups,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Iswaran puts it.  But we should not forget the  rationale\r\n\r\nfor setting up these groups in the first place, which remains\r\n\r\nvalid and which we should not inadvertently undermine.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that an umbrella body for all these self-help groups, which Mr Inderjit Singh suggested, would help,\r\n\r\nbecause all the self-help groups are already overseen by MCDS\r\n\r\nin  a  broad  way, and in fact PMO also keeps a watchful  eye\r\n\r\nover  them to make sure that they are fulfilling their proper\r\n\r\npurpose.   PMO  and MCDS  will check them  in  case  they  go\r\n\r\nastray.   The  Executive  Directors  of  these  groups   meet\r\n\r\nquarterly  to coordinate programmes and exchange  experiences\r\n\r\n(in  fact,  I understand they are scheduled to meet  the  day\r\n\r\nafter tomorrow for this quarter).  They communicate regularly\r\n\r\nwith  one  another  and with e-mail, telephone,  fax,  it  is\r\n\r\nhardly  a  problem.   They do keep in touch.   They  do  work\r\n\r\ntogether.   So  to add another umbrella body  will  only  add\r\n\r\nunnecessary bureaucracy and overhead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that the self-help groups are the reasons\r\n\r\nfor   differences  in  performance  between   the   different\r\n\r\ncommunities.  These differences are the reasons why  we  have\r\n\r\ncreated  the  self-help groups.  They are deep-seated.   They\r\n\r\nreflect partly cultural trends, partly other factors.  We can\r\n\r\nwork  to  make each group improve progressively.  I think  to\r\n\r\neliminate the gaps would take a long time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay dwelt at length on funding for self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  and  suggested  that  we  introduce  higher  matching\r\n\r\ngrants,   tax   incentives  to  promote  greater  inter-group\r\n\r\nactivities  and  mutual support.  I  do  not  think  this  is\r\n\r\nnecessary because money is not really the issue.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nwill, it is a sense of doing something useful.  And there are\r\n\r\nmany multi-racial groups which already exist, like the PA and\r\n\r\nthe CDAC and others which are already pursuing activities  on\r\n\r\na  multiracial  basis.  So the self-help groups  fit  in  and\r\n\r\ncomplement  that.   If  we do not think  that  the  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  have a valid mission on their own, I think we  should\r\n\r\ndisband  them rather than have them exist and then go counter\r\n\r\nto  that  and  try  and  pull them to launch  joint  projects\r\n\r\nthrough tax incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a sunset clause for the self-help groups in the\r\n\r\nlonger term, we have to take\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe matter in a proper sequence and have the self-help groups\r\n\r\nas long as they are fulfilling a purpose.  We cannot say when\r\n\r\nour  society  will be fully integrated.  We cannot  say  when\r\n\r\nthese  specific  problems which the ethnic  communities  have\r\n\r\nwill  be  resolved.  As long as they exist, there will  be  a\r\n\r\nmission  for these self-help groups.  If they do  not,  well,\r\n\r\nthen  we all enjoy a glorious sunset.  But I think that  will\r\n\r\nbe some time to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Race Relations Act was raised by Mr Zulkifli. He\r\n\r\nsuggested  that we take some of the points from there.   This\r\n\r\nis  something which we can consider in terms of awareness  of\r\n\r\nthe   issue   involved  in  discrimination  and  inter-ethnic\r\n\r\nrelations.  But I do not think that a legislative approach is\r\n\r\na good one.  The British have the Race Relations Act.  It has\r\n\r\nnot   really   solved  their  problems.   They   still   have\r\n\r\ndiscrimination between the whites and the blacks.  When there\r\n\r\nwas a black man who was murdered in South London a couple  of\r\n\r\nyears ago, they had been unable to solve the crime, and  part\r\n\r\nof   the   problem   is,  as  the  British  themselves   have\r\n\r\nacknowledged,  that  the police are predominantly  white  and\r\n\r\nhave  found  it  very difficult to get through and  empathise\r\n\r\nwith   the  black  community.   And  even  within  the  black\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Britain,  they have difficulties  because  the\r\n\r\nblack community are of different groups.  Recently, there was\r\n\r\na  case  of Damilola, a young boy from Nigeria, who  went  to\r\n\r\nBritain and was killed by other school children who were  not\r\n\r\nfrom Nigeria, black, but from other parts of the world.  So I\r\n\r\ndo not think that the legislative approach is going to be the\r\n\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is for us to establish trust and understanding\r\n\r\namong  the  races  and  proceed  at  a  pace  that  all   the\r\n\r\ncommunities are comfortable with.  It is encouraging that all\r\n\r\nthe   communities  and  their  leaders  have  supported  this\r\n\r\nobjective and even AMP has made their position clear, and now\r\n\r\non  the record.  So long as we make progress in widening  the\r\n\r\ncommon ground between the communities, however slowly, we can\r\n\r\ncontinue to build better lives for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam raised the question of Malay progress and of\r\n\r\nintegration of Malays and also whether Malays serve  National\r\n\r\nService  in  the  RSAF.   These are issues  which  have  been\r\n\r\nextensively  discussed recently.  In terms  of  the  progress\r\n\r\nwhich  has been made, the Prime Minister has put up  what  he\r\n\r\ncalled  a report card of the progress.  As for comparing  the\r\n\r\nprogress of the Malays with other communities, if you look at\r\n\r\nthe  Advance Data Releases based on the census, in fact a lot\r\n\r\nof  the  information  is  there, including  information  with\r\n\r\nhighest   educational   qualification,  literacy,   language,\r\n\r\noccupation or distribution, household size, dwelling type and\r\n\r\nhousehold  income.   And  if you  go  to  the  Department  of\r\n\r\nStatistics' website, which is www.singstat.gov.sg, all  these\r\n\r\nreports are available on the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the SAF and whether Malays feel that they are\r\n\r\nMalay Singaporeans or not, and how integration can proceed, I\r\n\r\nwould  recommend  Mr  Chiam to read what  transpired  in  the\r\n\r\ndialogue two weeks ago and was published in the Sunday  Times\r\n\r\nlast  week and, again, this week, of what the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nsaid and of his exchanges with the Malay community leaders to\r\n\r\nget an appreciation of a very deep issue which is going to be\r\n\r\nwith us for a long time, but which we have to understand  and\r\n\r\nempathise   with.    So  it  is  both  a   rational   matter,\r\n\r\nunderstanding it, and also an emotional matter, to be able to\r\n\r\nbridge that gap and gradually to narrow it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Singapore identity which Mr Ong Ah Heng and\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam See Tong raised, this too is a matter of hearts  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  heads  -  long term, instinct-building,  about  the\r\n\r\nobligations and the roles of Singaporeans.  It is  a  healthy\r\n\r\nsign that younger Singaporeans are asking who we are, what it\r\n\r\nmeans  to  be  a  Singaporean, what is our role  in  society.\r\n\r\nBecause  like  most young people, they are  going  through  a\r\n\r\nphase of questioning, search and discovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people are the future of our society. So an\r\n\r\nintegral part of the education is to imbue them with a  sense\r\n\r\nof  belonging  and  responsibility  to  the  nation,  and  to\r\n\r\nappreciate the fact that our security and economic well-being\r\n\r\nis not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  natural  state of affairs.  Our collective  and  continued\r\n\r\nsurvival depends on our joint effort, on the collective  will\r\n\r\nof all those who call Singapore home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy. If you are a Chinese from China, you\r\n\r\nwould  know who you are, 1,100 million of us.  If you were  a\r\n\r\nJapanese  from  Japan, you know who you are,  one  race,  one\r\n\r\nlanguage,  one country and descended from the Sun Goddess  of\r\n\r\nAmaterasu.  If you are an American, I think you also know who\r\n\r\nyou  are, the greatest nation on earth, a light unto nations,\r\n\r\na  city upon the hill, a certain history, idealism, a certain\r\n\r\ncollective  myth which defines your place in the world.   Who\r\n\r\nare we?  Perhaps, we are a little red dot.  That is something\r\n\r\nto  be  proud of.  Because we have achieved much together  to\r\n\r\nget  here.  An earlier generation fought long odds  to  build\r\n\r\nthis  Singapore and our generation continues  to  face  major\r\n\r\nchallenges  as a nation, challenges which call for  a  strong\r\n\r\nand  unified  response.  And I think we  can  all  feel  that\r\n\r\nSingapore belongs to all of us and it is a result of all  our\r\n\r\nefforts.   Now that we are almost a First World country,  not\r\n\r\nquite but almost, that does not mean our challenge is over.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to show that this success was not just a\r\n\r\ntransient fluke but a solid achievement that we will  sustain\r\n\r\nand build upon year after year.  And if we accept and believe\r\n\r\nthat, then I think we know who we are and what we need to do.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, of course, we will have to feel it at  the\r\n\r\npersonal level because this is a globalised world, people can\r\n\r\ntravel  anywhere,  work  anywhere,  feel  comfortable  almost\r\n\r\nanywhere  and  float with the waves.  But we need  to  anchor\r\n\r\nourselves here and remember the places where we grew up,  the\r\n\r\nfriends   we  went  to  school  with,  our  National  Service\r\n\r\ncomrades,  the  places we settled down  and  raised  our  own\r\n\r\nfamilies.  The Orchard Road wet market is gone - those of  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam's  generation and even my generation will remember  it.\r\n\r\nThe  younger  ones  will remember other places  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think  Singapore  is different  from  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThere  are many developed countries and we are almost one  of\r\n\r\nthem,  but  there is a certain atmosphere and spirit  to  the\r\n\r\nplace  which  we  will remember and associate  with.   It  is\r\n\r\npartly  familiar landmarks and favourite local foods, but  it\r\n\r\nis  also  memories and associations that link us to Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich make us call this place home, no matter where we are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to get Singaporeans to see this. It is a\r\n\r\ngeneration  which has grown up in material affluence,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Ah Heng pointed out.  So their experience and focus  are\r\n\r\non material issues, not matters of life and death or national\r\n\r\nsurvival.   Naturally, their perspectives and priorities  are\r\n\r\ndifferent.   But I think a Singapore identity is  developing:\r\n\r\nwhether it is the pride with which we celebrate National Day,\r\n\r\nthe  way  we stand up when confronted with prickly situations\r\n\r\naround  us in the region - as has happened more than once  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  few  years  even at a time of peace  and  relative\r\n\r\nstability  -  or the way we group together and reach  out  to\r\n\r\nfellow  Singaporeans when we are working and  living  abroad.\r\n\r\nWhether we go to Sydney, New York, London, Beijing or Mumbai,\r\n\r\nwe  will find there are Singaporeans there who have formed an\r\n\r\ninformal  network.   They celebrate our  festivals  together,\r\n\r\nthey  share common traditions and jokes, they speak the  same\r\n\r\nlanguage  (sometimes,  even  Singlish  helps  to  bring  them\r\n\r\ntogether)  and  certain  cultural affinities,  and  they  are\r\n\r\nmaintaining  their links together with each  other  and  with\r\n\r\nSingapore.   And provided we can do that, gradually,  we  can\r\n\r\nstrengthen this identity and say, \"We are Singaporeans first,\r\n\r\nand  Singapore Chinese, Malays or Indians second.\"   That  is\r\n\r\nwhat we are aiming for.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, Singapore's\r\n\r\nonly  resource  is  its people.  Their quantity  and  quality\r\n\r\ndetermine whether we can compete effectively.  Both are under\r\n\r\nthreat.   We  are not replacing ourselves, some of  our  best\r\n\r\nbrains  are  being  lured by the bright  lights  and  greener\r\n\r\npastures  in  other countries. The trend is not  encouraging.\r\n\r\nAs  our  resources are depleted, so our edge is  dulled.   We\r\n\r\nneed skills across the spectrum, from construction workers to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncorporate leaders, from maids to managers.  Some perform jobs\r\n\r\nwhich are shunned, others provide skills in short supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments for embracing foreign talent are\r\n\r\ncompelling.   Foreigners compensate for our numbers,  quality\r\n\r\nand disinclination.  They inject fresh perspectives at a time\r\n\r\nwhen  we badly need to challenge and change tried and  tested\r\n\r\nparadigms.   They give us a profile which comforts investors.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  is  determined that its  policy  on  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  succeeds.  It has introduced a slew of legal,  fiscal\r\n\r\nand  infrastructural measures to make the environment talent-friendly.   The private sector is beginning to  respond,  but\r\n\r\nthere is still work to be done to overcome insecurities.  But\r\n\r\nthis  policy does not appear to have been targeted, certainly\r\n\r\nnot  with  equal  vigour, at the public sector.   Is  it  our\r\n\r\nposition  that sensitive issues are best dealt with by  those\r\n\r\nwith  a  stake  in  the  country, and  that  therefore,  that\r\n\r\njustifies a special immunity for our public institutions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two dimensions to the issue of sensitivity.\r\n\r\nOne, where the vital interests of the state are concerned and\r\n\r\ntwo,  the  protection of confidential information.  But  both\r\n\r\ncan  be  addressed.  Highly sensitive portfolios can continue\r\n\r\nto be manned by Singaporeans.  There is force in the argument\r\n\r\nthat only those who understand our vulnerabilities and have a\r\n\r\nvested  stake  in the country can effectively deal  with  and\r\n\r\nthwart  threats,  external and internal.  But  that  argument\r\n\r\ncannot  be  made with the same degree of conviction  for  all\r\n\r\nbranches of the public service.  Why will there be a security\r\n\r\nrisk  if  a foreigner is employed, say, as a Deputy Secretary\r\n\r\nin  the  Ministry of Education or the Ministry  of  Manpower?\r\n\r\nAfter all, foreigners occupy sensitive financial positions in\r\n\r\nthe  Hong  Kong administration.  To be sure, non-Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin   Government  will  have  access  to  highly  confidential\r\n\r\ninformation,  but the safeguard is implicit  in  the  policy.\r\n\r\nThe people we want operate in the international arena.  Their\r\n\r\nmarketability depends on their integrity.  They of all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople,  understand that their standing would be  irreparably\r\n\r\nharmed if they act dishonourably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the private sector faces the same risks.\r\n\r\nConfidential information is at a premium, particularly in the\r\n\r\nareas  of  technology and the life sciences.  Leaks can  make\r\n\r\nthe   difference  between  success  and  failure.    In   the\r\n\r\ninternational  market where we compete, indiscretion  can  be\r\n\r\nhighly inimical to the interests of Singapore Inc.  But  that\r\n\r\nhas  not  stopped our GLCs and major private sector companies\r\n\r\nfrom  engaging the services of foreigners.  The fact  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is  that these people, whose track records  determine\r\n\r\ntheir  fate in this global employment market, are  the  least\r\n\r\nlikely  to  behave badly.  If all else fails,  there  is  the\r\n\r\nOfficial Secrets Act, no one who knows Singapore is under any\r\n\r\nillusion about this Government's resolve to use it to  punish\r\n\r\nand to make a point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the argument that issues which affect the\r\n\r\ncountry  are  best dealt with by those with a  stake  in  it?\r\n\r\nTake  the case of the judiciary.  It is, on any view, a vital\r\n\r\npublic  institution.   In applying and  fashioning  the  law,\r\n\r\njudges  have to be acutely aware of and sensitive  to,  local\r\n\r\ncustoms  and  circumstances.   The  judiciary  is  constantly\r\n\r\nconfronted  with, and has to address, questions which  affect\r\n\r\nour  national interests.  Instinctively, we are driven to the\r\n\r\nconclusion that therefore only Singaporeans should be judges.\r\n\r\nYet, in 1981, the then Prime Minister told this House that if\r\n\r\nhe was not able to get men of quality to be judges, he would,\r\n\r\nafter  consultation,  advise the President  to  appoint  non-Singaporeans to the High Court Bench.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That statement effectively put paid to the notion that\r\n\r\nSingapore's interests can only be advanced by Singaporeans or\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  necessarily be prejudiced if foreigners  hold\r\n\r\nsensitive   posts.    Fidelity  is  not   the   preserve   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   In  any  case, the  risks,  if  any,  can  be\r\n\r\nminimised  by  retaining  key  positions  for  our  citizens.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  it is a balancing exercise.  How heavily  should\r\n\r\nthese concerns weigh in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  scale of relative merits?  Should foreigners be enlisted\r\n\r\nto  help run our country?  The answer is that we really  have\r\n\r\nlittle choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our private sector is already being sapped of some of\r\n\r\nits  pep  by  emigration  and overseas  employment.   Foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  is  no  longer  available on  tap.   It  is  becoming\r\n\r\nincreasingly   difficult  to  fish  in  the   resource   rich\r\n\r\ninternational waters.  Other countries have joined the  game.\r\n\r\nThey  are  offering all manner of incentives  to  retain  and\r\n\r\nattract talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is two-pronged: Continue to encourage\r\n\r\ntalented foreigners to spend some time in Singapore  and,  in\r\n\r\nthe  meantime, optimise the use of talent in the local  pool.\r\n\r\nWe  are  doing  the  first, but are we doing  enough  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond?  Today, the best and brightest are drawn into  public\r\n\r\nservice  by  the  scholarship system.  That  means  that  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  is  deprived  of  this  valuable  home-grown\r\n\r\nresource.  Some do enter the private sector after serving out\r\n\r\ntheir  bonds.  But they emerge as different people,  with  an\r\n\r\narmoury  of  mindsets and instincts which may not necessarily\r\n\r\nequip  them  for  the  rigours of the marketplace.   Our  top\r\n\r\nstudents  match and sometimes beat the best  in  the  US  and\r\n\r\nJapan.   But they lose that shine in the real world.  Has  it\r\n\r\nanything  to do with what we do to our top graduates?   Other\r\n\r\ncountries have the numbers, so there is always enough  to  go\r\n\r\naround.   In  Singapore, we do not have that luxury  and  are\r\n\r\nforced  to allocate what is a scarce resource.  The  priority\r\n\r\nhas  always  been  to deploy our best in the public  service,\r\n\r\nthat   policy  has  served  us  well.   But  now   that   our\r\n\r\ninstitutions  are in place, and it has become  imperative  to\r\n\r\nenergise the private sector, we should not continue to divert\r\n\r\nthe flow of quality away from the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of having foreigners as public servants\r\n\r\nare  real and substantial.  They can replace some of our best\r\n\r\nbrains who can be released to add fizz to the private sector.\r\n\r\nThe  foreigners  who  step  into their  shoes  will  bring  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  perspective to public policy issues.   Not  having\r\n\r\nbeen brought up in the system,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey   may   not  feel  shackled  by  political  correctness.\r\n\r\nParadoxically, the fact that they will have less of  a  stake\r\n\r\nmay  work  to  our advantage.  They will feel less  inhibited\r\n\r\nabout  being  frank  and  open  in  their  discussions   with\r\n\r\npolicymakers,  and  candour cannot hurt  policy  formulation.\r\n\r\nAny  misperception that our bureaucracy is a closed and  cozy\r\n\r\nclub  will  be eroded by an infusion of outsiders.   That  in\r\n\r\nturn  will  generate greater confidence in the accountability\r\n\r\nof  our  institutions.   It  is  surely  an  objective  worth\r\n\r\nstriving for.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the employer\r\n\r\nin  the  civil service is the Government.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has a political face and a political role  in\r\n\r\nmaking  rules.   And in that political role in making  rules,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  claims that it has a symbiotic  relationship\r\n\r\nwith  the unions.  And because of this peculiar situation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government in the civil service, how people are  managed\r\n\r\nin the civil service is also the model that is looked upon by\r\n\r\nthe  rest of society.  So it is important that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  the  right model and sets the right examples in managing\r\n\r\npeople in the civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Government has made some changes to the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of people in the civil service.  Ministries  have\r\n\r\nbeen  decentralised with powers to manage their own personnel\r\n\r\nmatters.   These  are  good moves because  they  will  enable\r\n\r\nMinistries to respond quickly to changes and make  them  more\r\n\r\neffective to recruit, retain and develop people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the measures that the civil service has\r\n\r\nintroduced, such as changes in medical and other benefits, it\r\n\r\nhas  done  it fairly responsibly.  If we look at the  overall\r\n\r\nreport book, if we have to state, I think it will pass -  not\r\n\r\nvery  well,  but pass - because if we look at protection  for\r\n\r\nemployees,  etc,  they  have  done  well.   Is  there  social\r\n\r\ndialogue?   Yes, there is.  Are people having a part  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrial relations structure?  Yes, they do, but more could\r\n\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one area of deficiency is in the implementation\r\n\r\nof the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAct.   This  Act  is meant to provide for the  regulation  of\r\n\r\nrelations between employers and employees, and the prevention\r\n\r\nand  settlement  of trade disputes by collective  bargaining,\r\n\r\nconciliation and arbitration.  In the civil service, a  civil\r\n\r\nservant has to be classified as an employee under this Act if\r\n\r\nhe  wants  to enjoy the benefits of the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nAct,  and  it  has  to be declared by the President  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of this Act.  If a civil servant is not  classified\r\n\r\nas  an  employee for the purposes of the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nAct,  this  employee  does  not  have  access  to  collective\r\n\r\nbargaining, conciliation or arbitration.  I am aware that the\r\n\r\nPresident has declared Division IV and daily-rated employees,\r\n\r\nclerks, nurses and a lot of others in Divisions I, II and III\r\n\r\nas  employees.   But some of their job titles have  not  been\r\n\r\nupdated.   I am also aware that many a time, when  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  reaches  an  agreement with the  unions,  they  have\r\n\r\npoints  of  agreement  and exchanges  of  letters.   However,\r\n\r\nwhenever  there  are  disagreements  on  these  exchanges  of\r\n\r\nletters  or  points,  these are not enforceable  because  the\r\n\r\naggrieved  party  cannot  bring it  up  for  conciliation  or\r\n\r\narbitration.  So there is a weakness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am asking the Government to reconsider is:\r\n\r\non  the  one hand, it has a symbiotic relationship  with  the\r\n\r\nunions  and  recognises their contributions, and we  all  say\r\n\r\npositive  things  and there is a lot of support  at  national\r\n\r\nlevel,  on  the other hand, there is also a need  to  promote\r\n\r\nbipartite  relations in the civil service.  If  that  can  be\r\n\r\ndone, it would also help the civil service to be more attuned\r\n\r\nlike the private sector and respond quickly to changes.  This\r\n\r\ncan only be good for the civil service.  I ask the Government\r\n\r\nto  review  this practice of classifying employees,  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of the Industrial Relations Act, and to set standards\r\n\r\nwhich  are  equivalent  to that of a  private  and  statutory\r\n\r\nboard,  since for all things, you want to set the  benchmark.\r\n\r\nBe a leader in industrial relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I proceed to my next cut, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I urge hon.

On pensioners, during the debate on  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement, four Members of this House  spoke  on  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  the Government to be more generous to  pensioners.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister's response was that the adjustments  more  than\r\n\r\ncover  the  increase in cost of living and there  were  other\r\n\r\nperks  for  pensioners.  I would like to say that  pensioners\r\n\r\nare  people who worked hard in the past to contribute to  our\r\n\r\npresent prosperity.  In the past, we were told to tighten our\r\n\r\nbelts, make sacrifices and pensioners who were in that period\r\n\r\nmade  those sacrifices.  Those were the days when the budgets\r\n\r\nwere not generous, not so painless, but they made sacrifices.\r\n\r\nToday's  impressive reserves that we have, the prosperity  we\r\n\r\nhave, all the good things that we have, were built up by  the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to say that when you make pension\r\n\r\nadjustments, do not just make adjustments on cost of  living.\r\n\r\nWe  also  have to take into account the standard  of  living.\r\n\r\nOur  standard  of living changes, the things  that  were  not\r\n\r\nrelevant  then may still be applicable today.  And this  must\r\n\r\nalso be covered.  I am just saying that the 12,100 pensioners\r\n\r\ndeserve  more, and I hope the Government would  have  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  a mechanism which we can make periodic adjustments  to\r\n\r\npensions,  not  just once in many years, but more  frequently\r\n\r\nand in more substantial and significant quantums.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, there has been\r\n\r\nsome  renewed  interest of late in the  possibility  of  more\r\n\r\nwomen  being  fielded in the next general elections.   So  it\r\n\r\nseems  like  a  good time to bring up the subject  of  better\r\n\r\nrepresentation for women.  May I state upfront that  this  is\r\n\r\nnot engineered as a means of hinting to the Prime Minister on\r\n\r\nmy availability.  In fact, I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  talk mainly about better  representation  of\r\n\r\nwomen in non-political office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More women in Parliament is actually the far end of the\r\n\r\nspectrum   of  better  representation  of  women  in   senior\r\n\r\npositions  in  all  areas of public service  and  the  public\r\n\r\nsector  and, in fact, in the private sector.  The  Government\r\n\r\nhas little to say in private sector companies' management and\r\n\r\ngovernance  appointments.  But it is fully in charge  of  its\r\n\r\nown  recruitment,  selection  and  appointment  processes  to\r\n\r\nsenior   positions  in  its  Ministries,  National   Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittees,  statutory boards and GLC boards.   We  have,  to\r\n\r\ndate,  one  woman Permanent Secretary, one  woman  CEO  of  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board and 8% representation of women on  both  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards and the GLC boards.  I think in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nin  this IT day and age, we can do considerably better.   Let\r\n\r\nme  say that I am, by no means, asking for quotas to forcibly\r\n\r\ninject  women into positions they are not competent to  fill,\r\n\r\nor to ask for any deviation from our policies of meritocracy.\r\n\r\nThere  are enough competent women in Singapore out  there  to\r\n\r\nmore than adequately fill significantly more than those 8% of\r\n\r\nboard positions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that, firstly, many of our good women out\r\n\r\nthere  keep  a  very  low public profile.  Secondly,  current\r\n\r\nsenior  management, being largely filled by  men,  the  names\r\n\r\nthat  first  come to their minds, when vacancies open  up  at\r\n\r\nsenior levels, are those of people they associate with,  went\r\n\r\nto  school  with,  did NS with, played  golf  with,  and  are\r\n\r\ngenerally comfortable with.  All men, of course.  There is no\r\n\r\nmalice  in  this.   This is just the natural  consequence  of\r\n\r\nhistorical circumstance.  But what is needed, therefore, is a\r\n\r\nmuch  more  deliberate effort to search for women  candidates\r\n\r\nfor  every  vacancy and conscious effort  to  look  out  for,\r\n\r\nrecognise  and  overcome traditional biases in the  selection\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, as the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for\r\n\r\nMCDS,  Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee Shoon observed  at  an  International\r\n\r\nWomen's Day event last week, women must also play their  part\r\n\r\nand be willing to step forward to grasp opportunities that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  present themselves.  But in this instance, talking  about\r\n\r\nboard positions and not about political office, I expect that\r\n\r\nthey  would  not  be  averse to respond  positively  to  such\r\n\r\nopportunities.  Australia has some interesting experiences to\r\n\r\nshare.   Australia has 24% of women in their Parliament,  and\r\n\r\n30%  women on Government boards and bodies.  It has  achieved\r\n\r\nthis  through a concerted effort to put more women in  senior\r\n\r\npositions, including an early warning system which identifies\r\n\r\nhigh   calibre  women  candidates  early  in  board   vacancy\r\n\r\nprocesses,  and  in an executive search programme  for  women\r\n\r\nparticipation   on  these  boards.   Their  experience   also\r\n\r\nindicates that simply having a register or a list of names of\r\n\r\nsuitable  women  is  not  enough to make  a  difference.   It\r\n\r\nrequires a conscious push  from the Minister in charge of the\r\n\r\nrespective agencies to result in significant increased female\r\n\r\nappointments.   Indeed, in the past, some  women  groups  and\r\n\r\nindividuals have submitted lists of names but they  have  had\r\n\r\nlittle  subsequent feedback on whether they were put  to  any\r\n\r\nuse.  Indeed, the Business Times published a list of some 200\r\n\r\nnames  on  International Women's Day in 1998, but we  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  if anyone, with decision-making authority, gave it more\r\n\r\nthan  a cursory glance.  In our current environment, when  we\r\n\r\nare  constantly reminded of the need for diversity of  ideas,\r\n\r\nviews  and perspectives, and of the need for talent,  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  that  we  scour  the  world  for  it,  surely  it  is\r\n\r\nworthwhile to expend some additional effort to ensure that we\r\n\r\nare  fully  mining  the  human resource  and  potential  that\r\n\r\nresides in a whole half of our own population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before I end, some quick short words on women\r\n\r\nin  politics.  I have just two quick suggestions to  make  on\r\n\r\nincreasing   the   participation  of  women  in   Parliament.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  to  avoid the triple whammy for  women  of  family,\r\n\r\ncareer  and  politics,  besides the extended  search  now  to\r\n\r\ninclude  single  women, who presumably  would  have  to  deal\r\n\r\nlargely  with  career and politics, why  not  homemakers  who\r\n\r\nwould  have  only family and politics on their plate?   There\r\n\r\nare  many able women who have opted to be homemakers and they\r\n\r\nshould not be dismissed in considering\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncandidates.   In  fact,  I believe  Dr  Aline  Wong,  in  her\r\n\r\ncapacity as Chair of the PAP Women Wing, had already made the\r\n\r\nsuggestion a couple of years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, more efforts should be directed to persuading\r\n\r\nwomen  to participate through the NMP scheme.  The commitment\r\n\r\nis  for two years only, in the first instance, and there  are\r\n\r\nno  constituency  responsibilities.  If  the  difficulty  for\r\n\r\nwomen  is in the juggling of responsibilities, it will surely\r\n\r\nbe less difficult to persuade them to make that commitment in\r\n\r\nthis case.  Possibly not more effort has been made to recruit\r\n\r\nmore  women NMPs because of the ambivalence that even Members\r\n\r\nof  the  ruling  party have with regard to the  scheme.   But\r\n\r\nsince  the  scheme exists and has been found to be useful  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  10 years, why not use it to even better effect  to\r\n\r\nbring  more women into the political arena?  Look  for  women\r\n\r\narchitects, women accountants, businesswomen, women  unionist\r\n\r\nwho will not only represent their professions or sectors, but\r\n\r\nwould  also  bring diversity of more women's views  into  the\r\n\r\ndiscussions in this Chamber.  I hope the Prime Minister  will\r\n\r\ngive consideration to my suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I rise to speak on entrenching the\r\n\r\nElected Presidency.  This is an important issue, but  as  you\r\n\r\nhave instructed, I shall try to keep it very brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans have voted for the Elected Presidency\r\n\r\nand  more  now  understand  the  scheme.   Yet,  the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident  is  not  entrenched in our  Constitution.  Article\r\n\r\n5(2A)  would potentially make the Elected President's  office\r\n\r\npowers subject to a public referendum, if it is to be removed\r\n\r\nor  reduced, unless the Elected President agrees.   But  this\r\n\r\nprovision  is still not in force.  It has been suspended  and\r\n\r\nat present, Parliament could remove the Elected Presidency by\r\n\r\nsimply  amending  the  Constitution by  two-thirds  majority,\r\n\r\nwhich is quite easily obtainable by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point, Sir, is that we have fine-tuned the\r\n\r\nElected  Presidency  in  this last year.   We  have  come  to\r\n\r\nagreement on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  White Paper on the reserves.  We have also now come to  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding about the Net Investment Income (NII).  As  all\r\n\r\nthis  has  been done, it is not clear to me what  else  would\r\n\r\nneed  to  be done to complete the fine-tuning of the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresidency.   It is now some 10 years and we are  now  having\r\n\r\nthe second Elected President in that office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is, with the coming of general elections\r\n\r\nin  the  next  year or so, this would be a timely  moment  to\r\n\r\nconsider  entrenching the Elected Presidency and I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's Office will study the issue fully  and\r\n\r\nconsider it before the general elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave two amendments. May I take them together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, you will proceed with this one on\r\n\r\nAltered  Designation of President's Wife,  because  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\ncomes after you.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> As you please. This cut is prompted by\r\n\r\nthe  announcement  some time ago that  the  President's  wife\r\n\r\nshould  not be referred to as the First Lady, but simply  as,\r\n\r\nwhat  is her name, Mrs Nathan.  I was puzzled by this  sudden\r\n\r\nchange  in  this  designation. Then, there was,  accompanying\r\n\r\nthis announcement, an explanation, I believe, by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Law  that  it was not right for her to be styled  as  the\r\n\r\nFirst Lady because we do not have an Executive President.  So\r\n\r\nI  asked myself: what were we doing - was it two years ago or\r\n\r\nmore - when we amended the Constitution to give the President\r\n\r\ncertain executive powers?  Were we just playing a game?   And\r\n\r\nhe  is  now  to  be  told that he is no longer  an  Executive\r\n\r\nPresident but simply a ceremonial President holding office as\r\n\r\na ceremonial figure?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May we know why this change in the designation has been\r\n\r\nannounced?   May  I  know,  is  it  the  intention  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident  will no longer exercise any executive powers,  and\r\n\r\nall executive powers which were given to him have now been de\r\n\r\nfacto  taken away from him?  May we have an answer  to  that?\r\n\r\nWere  not  the spouses of the previous Presidents  before  we\r\n\r\nmade\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis change, addressed to as the First Lady?  I would like to\r\n\r\nbe  told  that I am wrong that they were not.  Could we  have\r\n\r\nsome  rational  explanation for this  sudden  change  in  the\r\n\r\ndesignation of the President's wife?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I fully agree with Mr Davinder\r\n\r\nSingh  that the public sector, as well as the private sector,\r\n\r\nought  to  make  full use of foreign talent.   I  am  not  as\r\n\r\nsanguine as he is that we have foreign talent then we can  do\r\n\r\nwith  fewer scholars and they can go forth and do great deeds\r\n\r\nin  the  private sector.  I think we should bring in as  many\r\n\r\ntalented  people as we can into the public sector as possible\r\n\r\nand that includes foreign talent in all suitable professions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can do more to attract them and they can contribute\r\n\r\nto  our public sector organisations without compromising  our\r\n\r\nvital  interest.  There are certain areas which  we  have  to\r\n\r\nkeep  as  a responsibility of citizens.  Defence and  foreign\r\n\r\npolicies  are  obviously two of them.  Some  other  areas  of\r\n\r\nsocial  and  economic  policies  are  politically  sensitive.\r\n\r\nTake,  for  example,  education.  It is  a  professional  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  matter, but it is also a political issue,  and  to\r\n\r\nmake those recommendations for decisions which affect tens or\r\n\r\nhundreds of thousands of pupils, I think you have to  have  a\r\n\r\nfeel  for Singapore which mostly Singaporeans only will have.\r\n\r\nBut  beyond  these areas, the public sector  adopts  an  open\r\n\r\nattitude  towards foreign talent.  So we can find  foreigners\r\n\r\nteaching   in  our  schools  and  universities,  working   as\r\n\r\npolicemen and prison officers, and in the civil defence.   We\r\n\r\nalso  have architects and technical officers in HDB,  nursing\r\n\r\nofficers  in our hospitals, and IT specialists  in  IDA.   In\r\n\r\nfact, IDA has a very multi-national team.  They have gone out\r\n\r\nto   recruit,  because  we  do  not  have  enough   qualified\r\n\r\nSingaporeans    to   staff   IDA.    And   without    foreign\r\n\r\nprofessionals, we would not be able to set up the outfit.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, with other statutory boards too. GIC, for\r\n\r\nexample, which manages our reserves.  We have found  ways  to\r\n\r\nbring\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  substantial  numbers  of  foreign  people   -   analysts,\r\n\r\ntraders, managers of the particular funds  - who can  fit  in\r\n\r\nand   strengthen  our  team.   And  even  our  policy-related\r\n\r\nstatutory boards, like MAS, EDB and NSTB, are recruiting from\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore, and some of them have substantial numbers\r\n\r\nof  foreign  non-Singaporeans.   EDB,  for  example,  has   a\r\n\r\nsignificant number of non-Singaporeans, but they work  as  an\r\n\r\nEDB  team,  and  they promote Singapore as fervently  and  as\r\n\r\nvigorously as the Singaporeans.  In fact, they give us a  run\r\n\r\nfor our money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too with NSTB, which has people from Malaysia, the US\r\n\r\nand  the  UK.  And in the case of MAS, recently, we recruited\r\n\r\nsomebody  - I think she is an Australian.  So if  you  see  a\r\n\r\nCaucasian  face  when  you  visit  MAS,  please  do  not   be\r\n\r\nsurprised.  It is still the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the longer term, when we bring in people, we\r\n\r\nwould  like to induct them and make them citizens, and  then,\r\n\r\neventually,  they become part of our team.  And  so  if  they\r\n\r\nrise  up  and  reach  the  top, at  the  core,  as  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries, as Judges, as the Attorney-General, we have them\r\n\r\nas  Singaporeans,  but  actually we  know  they  had  foreign\r\n\r\norigins.   So  our Chief Statistician, Paul Cheung,  is  from\r\n\r\nHong Kong.  The Permanent Secretary in MTI, Khaw Boon Wan, is\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia.   Many  of  our  Judges  are  from  overseas,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Chief Justice as well as the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nBut  they have become Singaporeans and they are part  of  our\r\n\r\nteam.   I  think that is the approach we should take -  bring\r\n\r\nthem  in, integrate them, as part of our team.  And  for  the\r\n\r\nbest  of them, most committed, encourage them to be citizens,\r\n\r\nand then they rise up in our core group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas asked about the Government as an\r\n\r\nemployer  and about bringing public officers under the  ambit\r\n\r\nof  the  Industrial Relations Act for their  benefit.   Civil\r\n\r\nservants covered under collective agreements include Division\r\n\r\nIV  officers and daily-rated employees.  As I told Parliament\r\n\r\nin   1997,   although  officers  in  the  other   grades   of\r\n\r\nappointments  are not covered under the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nAct for the purposes of collective\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbargaining,  the  civil  service has  allowed  all  officers,\r\n\r\nincluding  those in Division I, to join unions,  unless  they\r\n\r\nare  in  the  uniformed services, or if they are  members  of\r\n\r\npersonnel boards with personnel responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service aims to be a model employer. It is\r\n\r\nnot  for  us  to grade ourselves, and I am grateful  that  Mr\r\n\r\nThomas  has given us a pass, albeit not a very good one.   We\r\n\r\nwill  work harder to try and merit a higher grade next  year.\r\n\r\nRegardless  of  whether  officers  are  covered   under   any\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements, the civil service has  been  fair  in\r\n\r\nsettling their terms of employment  -  salaries, progression,\r\n\r\nbenefits,  etc.  And we regularly review terms and conditions\r\n\r\nof service against the private sector.  Had the civil service\r\n\r\nnot  done so, it could not have retained and attracted people\r\n\r\nto join the service in a full employment economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service has also tried to be responsible in\r\n\r\ndealing  with  other  labour management issues.   The  Public\r\n\r\nService  Division takes seriously requests to  review  policy\r\n\r\nrulings that have adversely affected individuals or groups of\r\n\r\nstaff.  PSD adopts a consultative approach when working  with\r\n\r\nunions  to  address  their  concerns.   And  besides  regular\r\n\r\nmeetings between the Ministries and the unions, PSD and  NTUC\r\n\r\nhave  held several joint management and union gatherings over\r\n\r\nthe past few years.  PSD also meets the Amalgamated Union  of\r\n\r\nPublic  Employees  (AUPE)  regularly  to  discuss  issues  of\r\n\r\nconcern  to  both sides.  And I am happy to  say  that  their\r\n\r\nrelations are good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the NMP's perspective, because\r\n\r\ncollective  bargaining  is one of the  traditional  roles  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions, and that is what unions exist for  -  to  push\r\n\r\nfor a better deal from your employer.  But today's employment\r\n\r\nenvironment has changed.  Union members are better  educated,\r\n\r\nthe  labour  market  is tight, and for  both  businesses  and\r\n\r\nGovernment,  flexibility  is  crucial,  to  enable  them   to\r\n\r\nreorganise and adapt to rapidly changing business conditions.\r\n\r\nTrade unions still\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplay  a crucial role in organising workers and looking  after\r\n\r\ntheir  welfare, but collective bargaining is often no  longer\r\n\r\ntheir  main priority.  Collective bargaining will remain  the\r\n\r\nbest way to look after the interests of the less skilled, but\r\n\r\nnot  so  of the better educated.  As the current arrangements\r\n\r\nin  the civil service are working well, I think we should not\r\n\r\nchange  them without careful study.  But we will look  at  it\r\n\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for pensions, Mr Thomas Thomas knows the position.\r\n\r\nWe  calculate  pensions  based on  an  officer's  last  drawn\r\n\r\nsalary.  Our philosophy has been, first, that pension is  not\r\n\r\nindexed  to cost of living.  It is what you retired  with  in\r\n\r\nfixed  dollar sums, and the Government will try to  keep  the\r\n\r\ninflation  rate  low.  Secondly, it is  pegged  to  what  you\r\n\r\nearned when you were in service  -  last three years' average\r\n\r\nof  drawn pay, rather than continuing to rise either with the\r\n\r\nsalaries  in  the  general  economy  or  with  civil  service\r\n\r\nsalaries.   Had  we  not done that, I  think  we  would  have\r\n\r\nimposed  a heavy burden on future governments, and  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  become  a burden, which would have become  increasingly\r\n\r\ndifficult to bear, as the population grows older, and as  the\r\n\r\npopulation of pensioners increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we chose this. It is not indexed. It is not\r\n\r\npegged to the cost of living, still less is it pegged to  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living.  In fact, I think there  are  very  few\r\n\r\ncountries in the world which peg pensions to the standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.   And those which have done so have found it quite  a\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have done has been to revise salaries so that\r\n\r\nofficers in service are paid properly, including full CPF  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases now, and it is for them with their CPF to provide\r\n\r\nfor  their  post-retirement pension  needs.   For  those  who\r\n\r\nretired  early,  we have, from time to time, made  ex  gratia\r\n\r\npayments to them, as the Singapore economy has prospered  and\r\n\r\nas  our  surpluses have accumulated.  We did so in 1996  when\r\n\r\nthe Government awarded ex gratia payments of between 6-13 1/2\r\n\r\nmonths of pension to those who retired\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbefore  1st  January  1982, which was  before  salaries  were\r\n\r\nsubstantially revised.  And we did the same again last  year,\r\n\r\nin August, when the Prime Minister, in his National Day Rally\r\n\r\nSpeech,  declared another ex gratia pay of about $16  million\r\n\r\nto  retired MPs, office holders and pensioners.  Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthey have been looked after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, can I take the question from Mr Jeyaretnam on the\r\n\r\nFirst Lady, because it is important to clear the matter?  The\r\n\r\nFirst  Lady  is  not a position enshrined  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution.    It  is  a  courtesy  term  that   has   been\r\n\r\ncustomarily  used  for  the wife of the President,  including\r\n\r\nprevious  Presidents,  before  the  Elected  Presidency   was\r\n\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When President Nathan assumed office, he indicated that\r\n\r\nhis  wife would prefer to be addressed as Mrs Nathan,  so  as\r\n\r\nnot  to create the impression that she is holding an official\r\n\r\nposition.   However,  since the term has  been  in  customary\r\n\r\nusage, President Nathan said that she was also comfortable to\r\n\r\nbe informally addressed as the First Lady by those who prefer\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Constitution does not provide for the\r\n\r\nposition of the First Lady, and the President's wife holds no\r\n\r\nofficial  appointment, she should continue to enjoy,  and  be\r\n\r\naccorded,  the courtesies, decorum and respect befitting  the\r\n\r\nspouse  of  the  person occupying the highest Office  of  the\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Elected Presidency, the constitutional\r\n\r\nposition  is  quite  clear.   We do  not  have  an  Executive\r\n\r\nPresidency.  We never had.  We have an Elected President with\r\n\r\ncustodial  powers.  And if the Member will read the  Hansard,\r\n\r\nhe  will know exactly what the position is.  Even if he reads\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution,  the  President does  not  have  executive\r\n\r\npowers.  He has custodial powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Simon Tay asked when we will entrench Article\r\n\r\n5(2A)   of   the  Constitution,  and  entrench  the   Elected\r\n\r\nPresidency.  It is something which we have not forgotten.  We\r\n\r\nhave not done it yet, because, although 10 years have passed,\r\n\r\nwe are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstill   refining  the  precise  provisions  of  the   Elected\r\n\r\nPresidency.  We settled the White Paper in 1999.  Last  year,\r\n\r\nwe  made  amendments on the definition of \"NII\", which  is  a\r\n\r\nmajor amendment.  So I think we have to let some time pass to\r\n\r\nsee  how  these  work out.  We are now on the second  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident,  the third if you count Mr Wee Kim Wee.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  if  in  five or 10 years' time, we have  not  made  any\r\n\r\nfurther  major changes to the structure, we will be ready  to\r\n\r\nentrench it.  But having just made the changes last year, let\r\n\r\nus see how the NII provisions work out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we first went into this and first brought the\r\n\r\nprovisions  into  effect, we did not understand  all  of  the\r\n\r\nimplications.   It took us many years to work out  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.  We now have the White Paper.  We have worked out  the\r\n\r\nNII.   Therefore,  the White Paper will need some  revisions,\r\n\r\nwhich  are  presently being done.  Let us see how these  work\r\n\r\nout.  Hopefully, they will work out well, and we will look at\r\n\r\nthe problem again in about a term's time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for women MPs and women statutory board members, I\r\n\r\nagree with Dr Jennifer Lee that we should have many more,  if\r\n\r\nwe  can,  on statutory boards and in Parliament.  It  is  not\r\n\r\neasy,  because we go on merit, and we have to  look  for  the\r\n\r\npeople and we have to look for individuals.  If we went for a\r\n\r\nquota,  of course, we can just fill the numbers.  But  if  we\r\n\r\ncan  find more, we will gladly do so.  And if the Member  has\r\n\r\nsome  names,  let us have them, and I promise her  that  they\r\n\r\nwill receive more than cursory attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for NMPs being housewives or home-makers, there is no\r\n\r\nambivalence about the NMP scheme.  It is in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nWe  believe they have made valuable contributions.   We  have\r\n\r\nhad  NMPs, men and women, who have done good work and  really\r\n\r\noutshone many of the Opposition MPs.  And if we can find some\r\n\r\nmore,  capable men and women, we would like to do so.   Under\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution,  the nominees must be  \"persons  who  have\r\n\r\nrendered  distinguished public service, or who  have  brought\r\n\r\nhonour  to the Republic, or who have distinguished themselves\r\n\r\nin the field of arts and letters,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nculture,  the  sciences, business, industry, the professions,\r\n\r\nsocial or community service, or the labour movement\".  It  is\r\n\r\na  wide  range of fields where you can distinguish  yourself.\r\n\r\nIt  does not mean that you have to be presently working.   If\r\n\r\nanybody  knows of women who happen not to be working but  who\r\n\r\nmeet  these criteria, I hope they will put them up  the  next\r\n\r\ntime Parliament invites nominations for NMPs, and the Special\r\n\r\nSelect Committee will consider them seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I should, overall, point out that this is a problem\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very  unlikely  to be  easily  solved.   Even  the\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries,  which have tried very  hard,  have  not\r\n\r\nsucceeded  in equalising the sex balance in Parliament.   The\r\n\r\nBritish,  which  have a record 120 women in  Parliament,  who\r\n\r\ncame  in with the Labour Party this time, and some call  them\r\n\r\nthe  \"Blair  babes\", are worried that in the next Parliament,\r\n\r\nthe  number will go down again.  Because if they look at  the\r\n\r\ncandidates  who  are  coming  up  to  stand  for   the   next\r\n\r\nParliament, less than a quarter of the candidates are  women.\r\n\r\nSo  you  already know from the candidates that  you  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  get enough.  And they have studied other  European\r\n\r\ncountries    -   this  is  the  British  Equal  Opportunities\r\n\r\nCommission - and they have found that quotas finally were the\r\n\r\nmost  effective way to get the numbers in.  And now they  are\r\n\r\nproposing  to  change the law to ensure that more  women  are\r\n\r\nrepresented in Parliament.  In other words, to change the law\r\n\r\nto  institute  quotas, so that you make  sure  you  have  the\r\n\r\nwomen.    And  the  Chairwoman  of  the  Equal  Opportunities\r\n\r\nCommission  -  I do not know why it is not the Chairman,  but\r\n\r\nit  is  the Chairwoman  - Julie Mellor said, \"This new  study\r\n\r\nbacks  up the Equal Opportunities Commission's view that  the\r\n\r\nlaw must be changed so that political parties are in no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  they  can use special measures to boost the  number  of\r\n\r\nwomen  they select.\"  This was from BBC News, Saturday,  10th\r\n\r\nMarch  2001, on the website.  I am sure the Member would  not\r\n\r\nrecommend  us to use special measures.  But short of  special\r\n\r\nmeasures, we will do everything we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, there was a call for more women\r\n\r\nMPs in Parliament, but I hope that there should be an equally\r\n\r\nstrong call for more Opposition MPs in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are no Queensberry rules in our elections,\r\n\r\nneither  is  there  a level playing field.  The  Opposition's\r\n\r\ngreatest  fear  is  the  practice  of  gerrymandering.    The\r\n\r\nOpposition  may work hard between the elections.   All  their\r\n\r\nefforts   come  to  nought  if  at  the  last   minute,   the\r\n\r\nconstituency they have been concentrating all their effort on\r\n\r\nis  suddenly taken away.  An example in point is the  single-seat  constituency  of  Braddell  Heights.   In  the  general\r\n\r\nelections of 1991, the Opposition obtained about 48%  of  the\r\n\r\nvalid votes cast in that constituency.  Suddenly, in the 1997\r\n\r\ngeneral elections, Braddell Heights' boundary was redrawn  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  part  of  Marine Parade GRC, which  has  no  common\r\n\r\nboundary   with   Braddell   Heights.    So   that   is   how\r\n\r\ngerrymandering works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want to have a fair and democratic election,\r\n\r\nthe  present  rules should be either altered or  changed.   I\r\n\r\nwant  to suggest that should the Government intend to  change\r\n\r\nthe  boundary lines of any constituency, they should give  at\r\n\r\nleast  one  year's  notice,  so  as  to  give  time  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to organise themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, broadcasting time should also be given to every\r\n\r\npolitical  party that takes part in an election, rather  than\r\n\r\nby number.  I believe currently it is half-a-minute for every\r\n\r\neight candidates.  But many of the Opposition parties do  not\r\n\r\neven have that number and are deprived of broadcast time.  So\r\n\r\nI  think every party that takes part in an election should be\r\n\r\ngiven maybe half a minute of broadcast time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the election date also should be announced at least\r\n\r\ntwo   months  before  the  elections,  rather  than  to  keep\r\n\r\neverybody guessing.  I think announcing the election date  is\r\n\r\nnothing  new.   This has been announced in almost  all  other\r\n\r\ncountries, and I think the Americans have fixed the  date  of\r\n\r\n4th November as the election date.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the deposit, I think it should be reduced by one-half. I believe at the moment, it is $8,000. It should be\r\n\r\nreduced  to  $4,000.  There is no reason to fix  or  peg  the\r\n\r\nelection deposit so high as to keep a lot of people away from\r\n\r\ntaking part in a democratic process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I think this GRC is definitely incongruous\r\n\r\nas far as elections are concerned.  You are having four, five\r\n\r\nor  six  candidates all at one go, and a voter will  have  to\r\n\r\nvote  six candidates.  He might like only two of them and  he\r\n\r\nis  forced to cast his vote for the other four.  This is very\r\n\r\nundemocratic,  because he does not want  the  other  four  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  him and yet he is forced to vote them  in.   Also,\r\n\r\nGRCs  are very communal in nature.  I think it should not  be\r\n\r\ncontinued.  At every election, the ethnic candidate will have\r\n\r\nto  go  and  declare  himself before  an  Election  Committee\r\n\r\nwhether  he is an Indian or a Malay.  This is very  demeaning\r\n\r\nto  our Singaporeans.  If he is a Singaporean, why should  he\r\n\r\ndeclare himself a Malay or an Indian before he can take  part\r\n\r\nin  an  election?   He  should  just  simply  say,  \"I  am  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  I have a right to take part.\"  But he  has  got\r\n\r\nno such rights in a GRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the element of surprise on the Opposition should be\r\n\r\nremoved.  If the Government has done its work properly, as it\r\n\r\nclaims  it  has, then it should be confident  of  itself  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  no need to spring surprises on the Opposition.   I\r\n\r\nassume  at this election, there should be no surprises sprang\r\n\r\non the Opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, you did mention earlier\r\n\r\nthat you do not have much to say.  So I presume you will make\r\n\r\nit short.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I shall be short when it comes to\r\n\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the first time I have raised this question of\r\n\r\na  Members' Register, and the answer I have got is, \"Oh,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister knows.  He keeps it locked up in  his  heart,\r\n\r\nand  that's  good enough.\"  Was it in the last  National  Day\r\n\r\nRally speech by the Prime Minister or some other speech,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  was  saying that entering  politics  is  the\r\n\r\nhighest form of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic  service.  I laughed when I saw that.  And I  posed  a\r\n\r\nquestion and we have never had any reply to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We keep constantly talking about how transparent\r\n\r\nSingapore is.  Everything is transparent and yet nobody is to\r\n\r\nknow  the  interests and the possessions of people who  enter\r\n\r\ninto  politics and become Members of Parliament, and how they\r\n\r\nare doing.  This is something which is observed in almost all\r\n\r\ncountries.   Why  is  it  that we who make  so  much  trumpet\r\n\r\nblowing about how transparent, how accountable we are, cannot\r\n\r\nhave  a  Members' Register, showing exactly what the Members'\r\n\r\ninterests are or the interests of their spouses are, so  that\r\n\r\nwe  do know whether they come into politics because of public\r\n\r\nservice or anything else?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\non  behalf of the Prime Minister.  Mr Chiam has made  several\r\n\r\npoints which I am sure if you have ---\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> left the Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam is not interested in my\r\n\r\nanswer.  He has already heard the answer before.  So he  just\r\n\r\nraised it perfunctorily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we come back to Mr Chiam who has raised some\r\n\r\nvery  serious  points.   Mr Chiam made  a  number  of  points\r\n\r\nconcerning redrawing of boundaries, new rules being  set  up,\r\n\r\nbroadcasting time, election deposit, and so on.  As he knows,\r\n\r\nall countries redraw the boundaries from time to time, and  I\r\n\r\ndo  not believe that we call them gerrymandering.  Boundaries\r\n\r\nare  redrawn  because population shifts and  the  pattern  of\r\n\r\nresidents moving into new housing estates also shifts.  So we\r\n\r\nhave   to  take  that  into  account  and  provide  for   new\r\n\r\nconstituencies or regrouping of constituencies, and  that  is\r\n\r\ndone  quite regularly and there is no surprise about it.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  Mr Chiam would like to be told way back in  advance,\r\n\r\nas  he says, a year in advance, when boundaries change.   But\r\n\r\nunfortunately  the Election Boundaries Delineation  Committee\r\n\r\ndoes  not sit so far ahead, as Mr Chiam would wish.   But  if\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCommittee  sits  and the report is completed, and  eventually\r\n\r\nthe report is submitted to Parliament, he can take a look  at\r\n\r\nit,  and  that  is when he can start to prepare  the  ground.\r\n\r\nWhether  the  party has enough time to go to the  ground  and\r\n\r\ncontest or not, much depends very much on what the party  has\r\n\r\nbeen doing during the period when there is no election.   The\r\n\r\nparty need not wait till election in order to go and find out\r\n\r\nabout  the ground, know what is going on the ground, or  even\r\n\r\ncultivate the ground.  He needs to have enough people  to  do\r\n\r\nthat.   And  if  he wants to zero in on a certain  number  of\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  by all means do that.  If he  looks  at  the\r\n\r\npattern  in the past years, some constituencies are contested\r\n\r\nand some may not be.  So I think he has got to work very hard\r\n\r\nto find the right kind of constituencies to contest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On election deposit, the deposit is set at 8% of the\r\n\r\ntotal  MPs'  allowance for the year, which,  I  believe,  now\r\n\r\nworks out to between $11,000 and $13,000.  And that is not  a\r\n\r\nlarge  sum  of  money.  If a candidate is able  to  get  one-eighth, about 12% of the votes, he can get his deposit  back.\r\n\r\nSo  in  a  very unlikely event that a candidate  just  simply\r\n\r\ntakes  the gamble and hopes to be elected and only gets  less\r\n\r\nthan the required percentage to reclaim his deposit, then  he\r\n\r\nhas taken the gamble and lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the GRC being undemocratic and communal, I do not\r\n\r\nbelieve  so.  This had been fully explained at the time  when\r\n\r\nwe  had GRCs, and we had gone to the Select Committee.   GRCs\r\n\r\nhave been in place since the elections in 1988.  I believe Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  went to talk to some students recently and they raised\r\n\r\nthe  same point.  And some students asked him, \"Mr Chiam,  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard all this before.  Haven't you got something  else\r\n\r\nmore or new to say?\"  Well, I do not know what he said.   But\r\n\r\nI believe that he must have said something.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On broadcasting time, broadcasting times must be\r\n\r\nproportionate  to  the number of candidates  that  the  party\r\n\r\nfields.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt  is  definitely not a level playing field if  he  says  he\r\n\r\nfields one candidate and he is entitled to the same amount of\r\n\r\ntime  as  the  one that fields 83 candidates.   That  is  not\r\n\r\nlevel.   That  is  very unequal indeed.  So the  policy  will\r\n\r\nremain as far as the broadcasting time is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has asked that we do not spring any surprise on\r\n\r\nhim.   Let me tell him something in advance so that he  would\r\n\r\nnot be surprised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to inform the\r\n\r\nHouse   that  from  the  next  general  election,  a  central\r\n\r\nannouncement system would be implemented.  There will also be\r\n\r\nseparate   assembly   centres  for   candidates   and   their\r\n\r\nsupporters.   This is different from the previous arrangement\r\n\r\nthat  candidates and their supporters gather at the  counting\r\n\r\ncentres  to  hear  the  announcement  of  results.   In  past\r\n\r\nelections,  even  though  the  announcement  of  results  was\r\n\r\nbroadcast  live  over radio and television, large  crowds  of\r\n\r\nsupporters  of  contending  parties  still  gathered  at  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  centres  to hear the results  being  announced.\r\n\r\nThe  atmosphere  of such gathering can be very  tense.   Some\r\n\r\ntroublemakers  appeared and taunted the  candidates  and  the\r\n\r\nsupporters from the opposite camp.  Such behaviour can  spark\r\n\r\noff  major  law and order problems.  Although there  were  no\r\n\r\narrests  at  announcement centres in  recent  elections,  the\r\n\r\npotential for a situation in such gatherings to escalate  and\r\n\r\nturn ugly is very real.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last general election, the crowd atmosphere was\r\n\r\nparticularly  tense at the Bishan-ITE where  the  result  for\r\n\r\nCheng  San  GRC  was  announced.   It  was  thus  prudent  to\r\n\r\ndesignate  a  central announcement centre and  have  separate\r\n\r\ngathering  points for different political  parties.   Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain how this central announcement centre works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the coming elections, the results will be announced\r\n\r\nand  broadcast live by the Returning Officer over  radio  and\r\n\r\ntelevision from a centralised announcement centre,  and  that\r\n\r\nis  likely  to  be at the Elections Department.   Apart  from\r\n\r\nsimplicity, this will avoid the problem arising from having\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsupporters of different political parties congregating at the\r\n\r\nannouncement centre.  Centralised announcement of results  is\r\n\r\nalready  practised in countries such as Thailand, Hong  Kong,\r\n\r\nAustralia and Germany.  However, in most countries, there are\r\n\r\nno  designated  places for contesting parties to  congregate.\r\n\r\nUsually, the contesting parties will gather at the respective\r\n\r\nheadquarters or at a large hotel ballroom.  In Australia, for\r\n\r\nexample,  the results are transmitted via computers from  the\r\n\r\nground,  and  are  placed  in  the  National  Tally  Room  in\r\n\r\nCanberra.   The TV network covers the results live  from  the\r\n\r\nNational  Tally Room.  Some MPs gather at the National  Tally\r\n\r\nRoom  while others gather at a large hotel ballroom to  await\r\n\r\nthe  results.   In  the  United States, the  announcement  of\r\n\r\nresults  is  decentralised.   However,  the  main  points  of\r\n\r\ncongregation for the candidates and the supporters are at the\r\n\r\ncampaign headquarters or at a hotel ballroom or the party HQ.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public will not be allowed into the\r\n\r\ncentral announcement centre.  Contesting candidates will also\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed into the central announcement centre because\r\n\r\ntheir supporters are likely to congregate at the vicinity  of\r\n\r\nthe  central announcement centre if the candidate  is  there.\r\n\r\nHowever, the media will be allowed to be present to cover the\r\n\r\nresults when they are announced.  Before the announcement  is\r\n\r\nmade  publicly, the candidates would be told of  the  result.\r\n\r\nThey can then get themselves ready to meet the supporters  at\r\n\r\nthe  assembly  centre  and thank  them.   This  is  the  same\r\n\r\npractice as in the past.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how the assembly centre works. Separate\r\n\r\nassembly  centres  will be allocated to  different  political\r\n\r\nparties  with  the  contending groups of the  candidates  and\r\n\r\nsupporters physically separated from each other.  The risk of\r\n\r\npotential  conflict  will  be  reduced.   Supporters  of  the\r\n\r\ncandidate  will  also have a safer place to gather.   Several\r\n\r\nelectoral  divisions will be grouped together  into  a  zone.\r\n\r\nThe  number  of zones will depend on the number of contesting\r\n\r\ncandidates  and  will  be determined  after  Nomination  Day.\r\n\r\nWithin each\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nzone, each contesting independent candidate or party will  be\r\n\r\nallocated one assembly centre, irrespective of the number  of\r\n\r\nelectoral  divisions  in the zone being  contested  by  them.\r\n\r\nMore details will be announced at the general election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam is not here to listen to this. But\r\n\r\nhaving   made  the  point,  I  should  reply  to  his  point.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  the  House would be left with no  answer  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion  raised.  This is not the first time  Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nraised  it.  I do not think it will be the last time too,  if\r\n\r\nhe  remains in the House or continues to remain in the House.\r\n\r\nThe  reasons  why  we do not need such a register  have  been\r\n\r\nstated  before  and  I  will  just  reiterate  very  quickly.\r\n\r\nFirstly,   Mr  Jeyaretnam's  proposal  does  not  necessarily\r\n\r\ncontribute to a clean government and uncorrupt practices.  It\r\n\r\nwill  not  stop  corrupt practices if an  MP  chooses  to  be\r\n\r\ncorrupt.   An  MP  who is corrupt will not  openly  list  his\r\n\r\ncorrupt  things in the declaration.  So apart from satisfying\r\n\r\nthe  curiosity of some people, this will not help to maintain\r\n\r\na  clean government.  Indeed, Mr Jeyaretnam must have thought\r\n\r\nof  this  practice  because it was practised  in  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom.  The British have such a system in 1974.  But we all\r\n\r\nknow  by  1994,  there  was  a  large  number  of  complaints\r\n\r\nconcerning  the sleaze problems of the MP.  As a result,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  had to set up a committee  on  standards  in\r\n\r\npublic  life  to  oversee the conduct of  holders  of  public\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our practice has always been that there is\r\n\r\na  code  of  conduct for the Ministers and the office-holders\r\n\r\nand  each  Minister or office-holder is required  to  file  a\r\n\r\ndeclaration  of  his  assets to the  Prime  Minister  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of each term.  And so the Prime Minister knows what\r\n\r\neach  office-holder owns and the Prime Minister does not keep\r\n\r\nthis to his chest, as Mr Jeyaretnam said.  The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nshows  that  list  to the President.  So  when  there  is  an\r\n\r\nallegation  of  misconduct, the declaration  would  form  the\r\n\r\nbasis for an investigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, all PAP MPs are also required to declare their\r\n\r\nincome  to  the Prime Minister, even though they are  not  in\r\n\r\ncharge of any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinistry or policy.  This system is instituted by the PAP and\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the Workers' Party has a similar system\r\n\r\nto  require  its  MPs to declare their assets  to  their  own\r\n\r\nleaders.  If not, then he should firstly put his own house in\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, if we have such a register, it would only\r\n\r\nintrude  on  the  personal privacy of members  unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nAlready,  it  is  quite difficult for us  to  get  people  to\r\n\r\ncontest and, doing so, would simply dissuade such people from\r\n\r\ncoming forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs  for\r\n\r\nanswering our questions.

To MAS' credit,  this  has\r\n\r\nnot   gone  unnoticed  by  foreign  market  participants  and\r\n\r\ninvestors.   Not  unlike  the  experiences  at  other   major\r\n\r\nfinancial centres, the regulatory\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanges  are  usually accompanied by wide scale consolidation\r\n\r\nof industry players.  Examples abound such as the merger of J\r\n\r\nP  Morgan and Chase, or closer to home, the merger of  Keppel\r\n\r\nand TatLee Banks and of DBS Securities and Vickers Ballas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  redefine  the role of finance companies  in  our  overall\r\n\r\nvision to be a major financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in December 1998, the MAS indicated that it would\r\n\r\nbe  reviewing rules to allow better-managed finance companies\r\n\r\nmore leeway in managing their risks, but without compromising\r\n\r\nprudential  standards.   This was  fleshed  out  in  part  as\r\n\r\npermission for finance companies to install ATMs in May 2000.\r\n\r\nSubsequently,  the better-capitalised ones  were  allowed  to\r\n\r\noffer financing for IPOs and to extend unsecured loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the statistics on loans extended by finance\r\n\r\ncompanies appear to point to an erosion in market share as  a\r\n\r\nwhole, especially of housing loans.  The only bright spot has\r\n\r\nbeen car loans, which were boosted by the spike in the number\r\n\r\nof COEs in Year 2000.  Given the fewer COEs to be handed out,\r\n\r\nthe demand can be expected to drop in tandem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of our local banks, DBS, OCBC and UOB have already\r\n\r\nabsorbed  their  finance  companies into  the  parent  banks'\r\n\r\noperations.   This  is  not  surprising  at  all   from   the\r\n\r\nperspective  of  optimising capital resources.   As  of  now,\r\n\r\nthere  are 11 finance companies, several of whom are  family-owned  and  very  small,  having assets  of  less  than  $100\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to also ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government will help facilitate a consolidation of these\r\n\r\nless well-managed or small capitalised finance companies.  If\r\n\r\nthere are shareholders who wish to exit the business but have\r\n\r\nbeen unable to find a buyer, can the MAS assist in any way?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, finance companies have\r\n\r\ncomplemented  banks  as  financial intermediaries,  servicing\r\n\r\nsmall and medium enterprises and small retail\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncustomers.   They  generally offer higher interest  rates  on\r\n\r\nfixed  deposits  than  the banks.  They offer  more  personal\r\n\r\nservice  to customers, and some older Singaporeans  are  more\r\n\r\ncomfortable placing their FDs with finance companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finance companies have been active lenders to small and\r\n\r\nmedium enterprises and in the housing loans and hire purchase\r\n\r\nmarkets.   Their  assets grew from $400 million  in  1968  to\r\n\r\naround  $22  billion in 1997.  But, as Mrs Lim has  observed,\r\n\r\nover  the  last few years, the finance company  industry  has\r\n\r\nbeen   in  decline.   They  face  growing  competition   from\r\n\r\ncommercial  banks, both local and foreign.  Since  1997,  the\r\n\r\ntotal  assets of finance companies have fallen by  11%.   The\r\n\r\nshare  of  the Singapore Dollar non-bank deposit  market  has\r\n\r\nshrunk  from  11.3%  back in 1997 to 7.4%  today.   This  has\r\n\r\nprompted mergers among finance companies, and between finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  and banks.  Several finance companies have  either\r\n\r\ngiven  up  their licences or gone into voluntary liquidation.\r\n\r\nIn  1998, there were 31 finance companies.  Today, there  are\r\n\r\nonly 11 and we expect this rationalisation to continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim asked if MAS will facilitate the consolidation\r\n\r\nor  exit of the smaller finance companies.  Consolidation  in\r\n\r\nindustry is not a new development and has been ongoing  since\r\n\r\nthe  1980s.   MAS  has  consulted closely  with  the  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  to ensure minimum disruption to customers  and  to\r\n\r\nthe  industry.  We have allowed the finance companies  to  be\r\n\r\nmerged   with  well-run  financial  institutions  that   have\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  the  ability to carry on the business,  as  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the  merger  must be to  result  in  a  stronger\r\n\r\ninstitution.  In practice, this has so far meant mergers with\r\n\r\nbanks and other finance companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should recognise the basic distinction between\r\n\r\nfinance  companies  and banks.  Banks  have  to  meet  higher\r\n\r\ncapital  requirements  and prudential standards.   They  also\r\n\r\nhave  larger and stronger management teams.  Because  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  do  not  meet these requirements,  they  are  only\r\n\r\npermitted  to  undertake a more limited range of  activities.\r\n\r\nFor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexample,  they may not provide cheque accounts  or  establish\r\n\r\noff-site   ATMs,  unlike  banks.   This  is   why   MAS   has\r\n\r\nreservations about allowing finance companies to be  absorbed\r\n\r\nby  institutions other than banks or other finance companies,\r\n\r\nfor example, stock-broking firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, I do not expect any fundamental shift in\r\n\r\nthe  activities of finance companies.  But they must continue\r\n\r\nto   assess  the  changing  environment  and  upgrade   their\r\n\r\ncapabilities  in  order to stay relevant in Singapore's  more\r\n\r\nopen   and   competitive  financial  landscape.   This   will\r\n\r\ndetermine whether they consolidate their position and reverse\r\n\r\nthe decline in market share.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the recent focus on\r\n\r\nthe quality of services of POSBank, both in the press and  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, once again raised the issue of bank mergers  and\r\n\r\nthe provision of post-merger services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members will recall, the merger between DBS Bank and\r\n\r\nPOSBank  led  to the closure of some POSBank branches.   This\r\n\r\nhas resulted in long queues forming in the remaining branches\r\n\r\nwith  customers having to wait much longer before  they  were\r\n\r\nattended   to.    Quite  understandably,   there   was   much\r\n\r\nunhappiness  all round.  And I am sure some comparisons  must\r\n\r\nhave  been  made  in the minds of POSBank  customers  of  the\r\n\r\nquality of service of the bank before and after the merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unhappy episode of course followed the earlier\r\n\r\nincident that involved the shut-down of DBS' ATMs because  of\r\n\r\napparently problems involving integration between POSBank and\r\n\r\nDBS'  computer  systems.  Sir, this is  not  to  mention  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  unhappiness  and dissatisfaction  that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfelt  over the issue of having to keep the accounts  if  they\r\n\r\ndid  not maintain a minimum sum in the account.  This has led\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans into asking whether or not they are better\r\n\r\nserved by the merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the POSB Transfer of Undertaking and\r\n\r\nDissolution Bill, Minister Richard Hu stated and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"DBS was a natural choice as the most suitable partner\r\n\r\nfor  POSBank.  Since the Government is the major  shareholder\r\n\r\nof  DBS,  it can be more confident that the DBS will preserve\r\n\r\nthe spirit of POSBank's social responsibilities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Minister recognises that there\r\n\r\nare  social  responsibilities  that  POSBank  will  have   to\r\n\r\ncontinue to assume even after it transforms itself completely\r\n\r\ninto  a  private sector entity.  And the nub of the issue  is\r\n\r\nthe  exact  scope  of  social or public  responsibility  that\r\n\r\nPOSBank  is  expected  to  shoulder.   The  man-in-the-street\r\n\r\nperceives  POSBank, Sir, as a public institution.   For  many\r\n\r\nwho grew up in the 60s, including myself, POSBank was perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  first savings bank that he encountered.  All through the\r\n\r\nschool  years,  and  even perhaps, his  young  working  adult\r\n\r\nyears,  POSBank was the place where his salary  was  credited\r\n\r\ninto,  and the ubiquitous ATM machines served as a convenient\r\n\r\nmeans  by  which  banking  transactions  were  carried   out.\r\n\r\nSurely,  the  services were not exactly sterling compared  to\r\n\r\nprivately-run  commercial banks but, surely also,  they  were\r\n\r\nnot worse off than perhaps they are today.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can understand the business imperatives that\r\n\r\ndrive many of the decisions for POSBank today.  However,  the\r\n\r\none question that we must ask ourselves is whether everything\r\n\r\nmust  be  driven by business imperatives alone.  The Minister\r\n\r\nhas  assured  us that POSBank continues to carry  its  social\r\n\r\nresponsibility, and that DBS will and, I quote,  \"Retain  all\r\n\r\nthe  good  features  of  POSBank  in  order  to  add  to  its\r\n\r\nattractiveness as a combined bank.  Certainly, the ATMs  will\r\n\r\nbe  maintained, and DBS has assured us that it will  continue\r\n\r\nto provide services for the small depositors and, indeed, for\r\n\r\nchildren up to 12 years old and students up to age 21.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are good services for the small depositor? It\r\n\r\nwould  be, I believe, for the man-in-the-street, the  ability\r\n\r\nto  continue  using ATMs with cards issued  by  other  banks,\r\n\r\nmaintain  savings accounts without levies, tax-free  savings,\r\n\r\nshorter queues\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  convenient  checking accounts - in short,  most  of  the\r\n\r\nservices that Singaporeans were used to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I accept that we cannot run a commercial\r\n\r\ninstitution  on  the  basis that it provides  free  services.\r\n\r\nThat would be true, if our starting point was that POSBank is\r\n\r\npurely a commercial institution without any legacy.  However,\r\n\r\nI  submit, Sir, POSBank is not such an institution.  It has a\r\n\r\nsocial responsibility, in particular, a responsibility to the\r\n\r\nman-in-the-street.  That responsibility would mean that there\r\n\r\nmust  be  a  certain amount of cross-subsidy to  see  to  the\r\n\r\ncontinuance  of certain essential, albeit not so  profitable,\r\n\r\nservices.   If  for  some  reason POSBank  should  choose  to\r\n\r\nrelegate  some  of  that responsibility, then  it  should  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  over a longer period of time and  not  so  soon\r\n\r\nafter  the  merger.  I would say that what DBS has done  with\r\n\r\nPOSBank, since merger, has been a disappointment for the man-in-the-street.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is in a position to intervene, either\r\n\r\nthrough  its  substantial shareholding in DBS or through  the\r\n\r\nMAS,  by  giving it greater clout to regulate the quality  of\r\n\r\nbanking  service to the customers.  I would, therefore,  like\r\n\r\nto  urge the Minister to consider a review of, and re-define,\r\n\r\nthe  exact  scope  of the role of POSBank in discharging  its\r\n\r\nsocial responsibility, as well as a review of the speed  with\r\n\r\nwhich POSBank may withdraw its services if, at the end of the\r\n\r\nday, it should decide to continue to withdraw.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I would first like to thank Mr\r\n\r\nSin  Boon Ann for covering quite a lot of things that  I  had\r\n\r\nwanted to say, and quite eloquently.  He has made my job much\r\n\r\neasier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to add on to what he has said on banking services,\r\n\r\none  of the points that the Minister told us when selling off\r\n\r\nPOSBank was to satisfy customer demands.  I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister to review whether this objective has been really\r\n\r\nmet,  because when we go down to the ground, most people seem\r\n\r\nto  be unhappy with the services they get under DBS than what\r\n\r\nthey got before.  DBS seems to be very successful in being\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndriven by the profit motive.  I have nothing against  it.   I\r\n\r\nknow that we need to have a commercially successful bank, but\r\n\r\nit also has social responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, when we tried to encourage workers to go\r\n\r\nfor  cashless  pay, POSBank was there to render the  service.\r\n\r\nWhen  we tried to encourage savings, POSBank was there.   And\r\n\r\nPOSBank  made  the arrangements to put ATMs  near  workplaces\r\n\r\nconvenient  for workers to withdraw money and go  along  with\r\n\r\ncashless pay.  But now the whole philosophy has changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a place where DBS gave two weeks' notice that\r\n\r\nthe  POSB ATM would be withdrawn in two weeks, and a  lot  of\r\n\r\nworkers  were affected.  They complained, but before even  an\r\n\r\nappeal  could  be  done, before the two weeks  were  up,  the\r\n\r\nmachine   just  disappeared.   We  can  say  that  there   is\r\n\r\nefficiency,  but I do not know whether it is efficiency  when\r\n\r\nit  gives  people two weeks' notice and before the two  weeks\r\n\r\nare up, the machine disappears.  But it causes people to feel\r\n\r\nvery  unhappy and that they have not been well taken care  of\r\n\r\nor well treated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When DBS took over POSBank, they had a captive audience,\r\n\r\na  lot  of  goodwill.  And thanks to the POSBank  network,  I\r\n\r\nthink DBS is making profits, which is all right.  But has DBS\r\n\r\nmet   its   objective   of  meeting  customers'   needs   and\r\n\r\nrequirements?  I would ask the Minister to review whether DBS\r\n\r\nhas  kept faith with the original terms of sale and, if  not,\r\n\r\nfor  the greater good of all Singaporeans, to review it again\r\n\r\nand let us take a new look at this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr\r\n\r\nThomas  Thomas for raising this problem of DBS-POSBank.   The\r\n\r\nissue is in the public eye again because of the recent branch\r\n\r\nclosures  and some ATM relocations, and also the introduction\r\n\r\nof  bank  charges  by  DBS.  Let me  briefly  recap  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  allowed POSBank to be acquired by  DBS  and  then\r\n\r\nexplain the current situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than 25 years, POSBank was a leader in\r\n\r\nproviding  basic  retail banking services to  the  community.\r\n\r\n95% of adult\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans had POSBank savings accounts.  Mr Sin  Boon  Ann\r\n\r\nwas  one  of them, so am I, so are most Members.  But POSBank\r\n\r\nwas losing money on its small accounts, and three out of four\r\n\r\nof  its  accounts were not commercially viable,  and  it  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to cross-subsidise smaller depositors, using  margins\r\n\r\nfrom the larger accounts.  It could not really continue doing\r\n\r\nthis,   because  the  bigger  depositors  were  taking  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  to  other banks offering higher  returns  and  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated products.  So POSBank was losing  market  share\r\n\r\nand,  in  fact, had to reverse its strategy of  paying  lower\r\n\r\naccounts  higher interest, and to pay bigger accounts  higher\r\n\r\ninterest, in order to try and reverse this tendency.  But the\r\n\r\nstrategy   of  cross-subsidising  small  accounts   was   not\r\n\r\nsustainable,  and  even if DBS and POSBank  had  not  merged,\r\n\r\nPOSBank  could  not  have  continued  offering  free  banking\r\n\r\nservices to all customers indefinitely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the backdrop globally in the industry\r\n\r\nwas  of  banking  mergers, because technology was  advancing,\r\n\r\nregulatory barriers were coming down, consumers were becoming\r\n\r\nmore   sophisticated,  demanding  higher  quality  integrated\r\n\r\nfinancial  services.  So the banks had to find  economies  of\r\n\r\nscale, economies of scope, big enough and broad enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our local banks too needed critical mass to justify\r\n\r\nheavy  but  essential investments in new technology,  markets\r\n\r\nand distribution channels.  DBS recognised this need and made\r\n\r\nan offer to acquire POSBank in 1998.  The Government accepted\r\n\r\nDBS' offer instead of putting POSBank up for bids, because it\r\n\r\nwanted POSBank to continue fulfilling a social function after\r\n\r\nthe merger and DBS was willing to accept this responsibility,\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Sin  and Mr Thomas have reminded us of  this  social\r\n\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what has happened since the merger? DBS has\r\n\r\nrationalised  its  branch  network,  introduced  charges  for\r\n\r\ncheque  services and savings accounts with balances  of  less\r\n\r\nthan  $500,  and  it did these because it needed  to  improve\r\n\r\nefficiency and recover at least part of the cost of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservicing customer transactions.  These changes have  stirred\r\n\r\npublic  concerns  over  whether DBS  is  still  committed  to\r\n\r\nserving  the mass market, and whether basic banking  services\r\n\r\nwill remain within the reach of all Singaporeans.  We debated\r\n\r\nthe  matter  in Parliament last year after DBS imposed  a  $2\r\n\r\ncharge  on  small  savings accounts.   But,  recently,  their\r\n\r\nconcerns got stirred again because of long queues, delays  in\r\n\r\nintegrating POSBank, DBS branches, ATM failures and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS has reiterated its commitment to continue providing\r\n\r\nbanking  services  that are accessible to all  at  affordable\r\n\r\nprices.  It is rationalising its branch and ATM network,  but\r\n\r\nit  has  no  intention of leaving the mass market unserviced,\r\n\r\nleaving  the small depositors stranded.  The present problems\r\n\r\nare  transitional teething problems, and DBS has assured  MAS\r\n\r\nthat it is doing everything possible to address them.  It  is\r\n\r\nreally for DBS itself, rather than the Government, to justify\r\n\r\nto  its customers and the public the bank's actions.  DBS has\r\n\r\nexplained publicly some of the steps it is taking, eg, it has\r\n\r\nimposed a temporary moratorium on further branch closures, it\r\n\r\nis  enhancing  the  training of counter staff  and  educating\r\n\r\ncustomers  on  the  use  of  ATMs,  it  is  introducing  cash\r\n\r\nacceptance machines so that customers do not have to queue up\r\n\r\nat the counter but just need to put the cash into a machine - faster and more convenient.  And DBS has also stated that  it\r\n\r\nis not cutting back on its ATM network and, in fact, plans to\r\n\r\nexpand  on  the  total number of ATMs that  DBS  and  POSBank\r\n\r\ntogether had at the time of the merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked DBS, \"Frankly, are these queues a reflection of\r\n\r\nyour  intention  to cut back on your service  or  is  this  a\r\n\r\nproblem  we have to solve?\"  They said, no, it is  a  problem\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  solve,  they are not cutting  back  on  their\r\n\r\nservice.  They have had to rationalise ATMs and branches, but\r\n\r\ntheir service coverage will remain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I asked for the number of ATMs. POSBank started off\r\n\r\nwith 654.  When POSBank and DBS merged, DBS had 287,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso  together, they had 941.  So, in fact, straightaway, if we\r\n\r\nare  using ATMs, we have got more coverage rather than  less.\r\n\r\nNow  it  is slightly down because they are in the process  of\r\n\r\nrenewing  and  upgrading the ATMs, so they are down  to  878.\r\n\r\nBut  they expect by the end of this year to go back up to 920\r\n\r\nbetter deployed, better ATMs.  So, if we are looking at ATMs,\r\n\r\nI  think  the total coverage, the total number of  points-of-presence where we can get service, is more rather than  less.\r\n\r\nIt has improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of branches, POSBank started with 126, DBS\r\n\r\nitself  had  42  at the point of merger, excluding  the  head\r\n\r\noffice, so together that was 168.  Today, the total number of\r\n\r\nbranches  is  72  for POSBank, 37 for DBS,  three  extra  DBS\r\n\r\nBusiness Centres with staff, adding up to a total of 112.  So\r\n\r\nthe  total  reduction  is  from 126  to  112,  which  is  not\r\n\r\nsignificant, but the 112 presumably would be better deployed,\r\n\r\nbetter  spaced  out.  The problem is that the integration  of\r\n\r\ntheir  branches has not taken place properly, delayed because\r\n\r\nthey  had  Y2K problems.  As a result, although  there  is  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  112  branches, we cannot go to any branch  and  do\r\n\r\nanything,  whereas for the ATMs, we can really go to  any  of\r\n\r\nthese   800-odd  ATMs,  whether  DBS  or  POSBank,   and   do\r\n\r\ntransactions.   But DBS has assured us they  will  have  that\r\n\r\ndone  by  the  third quarter of this year and, once  that  is\r\n\r\ndone, this service will be restored and, I hope, improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked specifically about Mr Thomas Thomas' ATM problem\r\n\r\nbecause  he  had  raised it, I think, last  week  during  the\r\n\r\nBudget debate.  This is at the ferry terminal, I believe, and\r\n\r\nthe  answer is that this was one of its less-used ATMs.   Its\r\n\r\nutilisation was below half the average rate and  so  the  ATM\r\n\r\nhad  to be closed.  The expiry date of the rental was  to  be\r\n\r\n31st  January  2001  but, because of Chinese  New  Year,  DBS\r\n\r\nnegotiated  with its landlord to hand over the  premises  one\r\n\r\nmonth  later, 28th February.  But DBS needed a week  to  take\r\n\r\naway  the  ATM,  paint,  touch  up,  and  make  good,  so  it\r\n\r\nterminated its services on 19th February, one week before the\r\n\r\ndeadline for getting off the site.  It gave notice from 1st\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFebruary,  so customers had 19 days' notice, instead  of  the\r\n\r\nusual one-month notice.  DBS could have done better, but I do\r\n\r\nnot  think this is a sign that ATMs are disappearing all over\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $500 fee which both Members raised again was\r\n\r\nsomething  which  we debated extensively last  year  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.   As  a  result of the discussion,  DBS  introduced  a\r\n\r\nscheme  once we liberalised our CPF rules to allow low-income\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  drawing pay, to transfer  $500  from  their\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account  into DBS to meet this $500  requirement  in\r\n\r\norder  that  they would not have to pay the $2 fee.   So  the\r\n\r\nmechanism is in place.  If they really cannot afford  the  $2\r\n\r\nfee,  and if they really meet the $500 minimum quantum,  they\r\n\r\ncan  make  an  arrangement  to transfer  from  their  Special\r\n\r\nAccount,  and  DBS will waive the fee.  The  arrangement  has\r\n\r\nbeen in place.  I understand from DBS, in fact, 10,000 people\r\n\r\napplied, of whom 5,000 met the criteria.  It is quite a small\r\n\r\nnumber.  So the facility is available, but it is really up to\r\n\r\npeople  whether they want or do not want to use it.   If  DBS\r\n\r\nhad been more careful and had done this first before imposing\r\n\r\nthe  fee, I think it would have gone down better, but we  all\r\n\r\nlearn from our mistakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fulfilling its commitment to offer basic banking\r\n\r\nservices,  DBS has to take into account commercial realities.\r\n\r\nEach  ATM withdrawal costs the bank between 30 cents and  $2,\r\n\r\ndepending on how much economies of scale the bank  has.   The\r\n\r\nATMs have to be replenished and serviced, and security checks\r\n\r\nhave  to be made.  Transactions at the branch cost even  more\r\n\r\nbecause  the  bank  has  to  pay for  rent,  staff  salaries,\r\n\r\nelectronic facilities and security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, banks have introduced basic no-frills\r\n\r\nbank  accounts  with limited transaction features,  sometimes\r\n\r\nmandated  by  the  government.  But these are  typically  not\r\n\r\nfree.   For  example, in New York State in America,  a  basic\r\n\r\naccount  allows eight free withdrawals, but you  pay  US$3  a\r\n\r\nmonth.   In  Australia,  an  account  permitting  eight  free\r\n\r\nwithdrawals  will  cost A$4 a month, if  your  balance  falls\r\n\r\nbelow A$1,000.  This is higher than the fall-below\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfee  which  DBS  and the other local banks charge  for  small\r\n\r\nsavings accounts with unlimited number of transactions.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On social responsibility, basic banking services must be\r\n\r\navailable but to make them free, I think is not possible  and\r\n\r\nwas  never promised.  It was made quite clear right from  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  that adjustments would have to be made,  but  they\r\n\r\nwould go out of their way to make sure that they service this\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when introducing the fall-below fees on savings\r\n\r\naccounts,  DBS  automatically  exempted  about  one   million\r\n\r\naccounts belonging to Singaporeans, those over the age of 62,\r\n\r\nthose below the age of 21, full-time National Servicemen  and\r\n\r\nthose  on the public assistance scheme.  In fact, if you  ask\r\n\r\nwhether DBS has lived up to its bargain, I would say yes,  it\r\n\r\nhas.  But it cannot be responsible for providing free banking\r\n\r\nservices for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can MAS do to help make banking services affordable\r\n\r\nand  accessible?   As  I explained last  year,  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from other countries.  We do not have a big  rural\r\n\r\narea population and remote villages, unable to be reached  by\r\n\r\nbank  branches.  We are compact, we are a city.  I  think  we\r\n\r\ncan  have  a  network where there is a comprehensive  set  of\r\n\r\nbranches,  covering the whole of the island, where  ATMs  are\r\n\r\nalso  comprehensively available, perhaps not at  every  ferry\r\n\r\nterminal,  but all over the island, and it is affordable  for\r\n\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that we have done recently was to\r\n\r\napprove the use of cash-back services.  In other words,  when\r\n\r\nyou  buy something at a shop, if you buy $50 worth, you enter\r\n\r\nthe  ATM terminal for $70, you collect your purchases and you\r\n\r\ncollect  $20  from  the cashier.  This  gives  consumers  the\r\n\r\nconvenience and a choice of withdrawing cash at participating\r\n\r\nretail  outlets, which means, instead of depending on 900  or\r\n\r\n1,000  ATMs,  you will have many, many more ATMs  than  that.\r\n\r\nEvery  shopping outlet becomes potentially an ATM.   NETS  is\r\n\r\nplanning to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlaunch this service soon, in collaboration with Fairprice and\r\n\r\nseveral other major retailers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing which we propose to approve is to allow\r\n\r\nbanks  to  set  up limited-purpose branches  on  third  party\r\n\r\npremises.  In other words, you do not have to have  your  own\r\n\r\nbranch,  rent  premises, have a full shop  and  have  a  full\r\n\r\nbranch.   You can rent a space, sublet somebody's  HDB  shop,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  and put a little counter there, provide  basic\r\n\r\nservices.  It is cheaper and more accessible.  Then the banks\r\n\r\ncan  negotiate with third parties, such as post  offices  and\r\n\r\nsupermarkets,  and leverage on their staff  and  premises  to\r\n\r\nprovide  basic  services, including  cheque  desposits,  cash\r\n\r\nwithdrawals  and  other  payments  through  existing   retail\r\n\r\nnetworks.  This way, banks can reduce the costs of delivering\r\n\r\nbanking services, resulting in savings for consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will do what we can to make banking affordable\r\n\r\nand  accessible, and I think we can do a considerable amount,\r\n\r\nbut  in  the end, we cannot avoid some changes and we  cannot\r\n\r\navoid  some charges. We will try to space out the adjustments\r\n\r\nover  a  period of time, rather than suddenly.  DBS, I think,\r\n\r\nhas  taken  a step back.  They are adjusting their  programme\r\n\r\nnow.   I  have  confidence  that  they  will  overcome  their\r\n\r\nteething problems and provide the service which they  promise\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have brought up this issue\r\n\r\nabout  a  third board for listing Singapore companies before.\r\n\r\nThe  main  issue is the balance of having a third  board  for\r\n\r\nlisting  of new and risky companies versus using the existing\r\n\r\nmain  and Sesdaq boards for fund-raising by companies.  While\r\n\r\nSingapore is currently too small a market to justify a  third\r\n\r\nboard,  we  should expect Singapore to grow as a  significant\r\n\r\nfinancial  hub for the region.  It is therefore, an opportune\r\n\r\ntime  for  us to have a third board or as an alternative,  an\r\n\r\nover-the-counter  (OTC) board, for ease  of  fund-raising  so\r\n\r\nthat in the long-term, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  have  a  much more vibrant place for fund-raising  and\r\n\r\nstock market investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My complaint is not so much that companies are not able\r\n\r\nto raise funds, but the problem is the approach that has been\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) for the last two years\r\n\r\nto make it easier for companies without track records to list\r\n\r\non  both boards in Singapore.  It became so easy that so much\r\n\r\nso  there  were  too  many  examples  of  fundamentally  weak\r\n\r\ncompanies  that got listed easily, resulting in the investing\r\n\r\npublic  getting  hurt, while the promoters of  the  companies\r\n\r\nmade  their money.  While I know that the answer is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  that  investors  must  be more  prudent  and  study  such\r\n\r\nofferings  of  public listings carefully before making  their\r\n\r\ninvestments, the fact is that some of them, together with the\r\n\r\nadvisors,  do  a very good job in marketing their  companies,\r\n\r\nand  the prospectuses are so detailed and legalistic that the\r\n\r\ncommon  man  finds  it  difficult  to  fully  comprehend  the\r\n\r\ncontents.   When we see too many fundamentally weak companies\r\n\r\ngetting  approvals to list on our two boards, the  unintended\r\n\r\neffect  is  also that the reputation and credibility  of  our\r\n\r\nmain  board  and of SGX comes into question.   Why  were  the\r\n\r\nregulators  not able to sieve out the companies  that  should\r\n\r\nnot have been listed in the first place?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that we go for the third board for emerging\r\n\r\nand  technology  and  risky companies  to  raise  funds.   By\r\n\r\nsegregating the three boards this way, where we know that the\r\n\r\nthird  board  is  for  high-risk  companies  to  get  listed,\r\n\r\ninvestors  would, right from the beginning,  know  about  the\r\n\r\nrisk  nature of their investments.  We should also  take  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to use technology to make it into a global board,\r\n\r\nif we want to do this, that trading can go on for 24 hours  a\r\n\r\nday, not just to service markets in Singapore, but the global\r\n\r\nmarket and, where trading can be done in global currencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel this is the best way forward to further ease fund-raising issues in Singapore while we avoid tarnishing the\r\n\r\nimage   of  our  two  existing  boards,  as  is  the  current\r\n\r\nsituation,  when fundamentally weak companies get  listed  on\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, on Mr Inderjit Singh's idea\r\n\r\nof a third board, he raised it last year and I explained then\r\n\r\nwhy  I  did not think it was practical.  Since then, SGX  has\r\n\r\nhad  an  eventful year.  Many companies have had their  IPOs.\r\n\r\nSome were successful, others not.  The question is whether in\r\n\r\nthe light of this experience, we now think a third board is a\r\n\r\ngood  idea.  We have asked SGX and in their view,  which  MAS\r\n\r\nagrees with, the answer is still no.  Let me explain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX's basic decision is what criteria to use when\r\n\r\nallowing a company to be listed and when allowing the  public\r\n\r\nto  trade shares in the company, whichever board the  company\r\n\r\ngoes on.  What are the criteria for letting it be listed  and\r\n\r\nletting the public buy and sell the shares?  Mr Singh  argues\r\n\r\nthat if we put risky shares on a third board, this would be a\r\n\r\nsignal from SGX to the public that the shares are more risky.\r\n\r\nThere  are some examples overseas where they have tried  this\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our approach is: the investing public should\r\n\r\nalready  know, from the company's prospectus, the  nature  of\r\n\r\ntheir business and the risks which the company is subject to.\r\n\r\nIf   a  retail  investor  needs  help  in  interpreting   the\r\n\r\nprospectus, which sometimes he does because it is  put  in  a\r\n\r\ncomplicated way, there are analysts and financial journalists\r\n\r\nwho  comment publicly on pending issues, and whose considered\r\n\r\nopinions the retail investor can read in the newspapers.   If\r\n\r\nSGX  had  to  decide  which of several boards  to  allow  the\r\n\r\ncompany  on  to, it would have to base its judgement  on  the\r\n\r\nsame  public  information that is already in  the  prospectus\r\n\r\nbecause  SGX should not have information which is  secret  to\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, SGX does not want to pass judgement on the\r\n\r\ncompany,  beyond deciding that it meets the listing criteria.\r\n\r\nTo   do   so  would  be  inconsistent  with  disclosure-based\r\n\r\nregulation, and would bring SGX back to the pitfalls of merit-based regulation which it used to practise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that several IPOs were under-subscribed this\r\n\r\nyear  and  tanked suggest that investors do know  a  doubtful\r\n\r\nproposition when they see one.  They are not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch  suckers.   They may not have understood  all  the  fine\r\n\r\nprint  and legal language, but they knew enough not  to  part\r\n\r\nwith  their  money.   It  is only when investors  pursue  the\r\n\r\nshares  of a risky company without realising the risks,  then\r\n\r\nwe have a problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also be clear about the motivations for\r\n\r\nwanting to segregate risky companies onto a third board.   Is\r\n\r\nit  to  encourage  more adventurous investors  to  buy  their\r\n\r\nshares,  or is it to warn off investors who may not be  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  risks?  I do not believe that the present SGX  rules\r\n\r\nprevent any companies from listing who could list on a  third\r\n\r\nboard, as Mr Singh acknowledges.  Nor do the rules hold  back\r\n\r\nany  adventurous investors seeking risky stocks  prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept the downside in the hope of high returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of other countries confirms that setting\r\n\r\nup  a  third  board would not, in itself, draw liquidity  and\r\n\r\ninterest   to  the  companies  listed  on  it.   During   the\r\n\r\ntechnology  stock boom, exchanges in several Asian  countries\r\n\r\ncreated  technology boards along the lines  suggested.   They\r\n\r\nhave  had mixed success.  Some attracted significant interest\r\n\r\nin  their  initial  months, but have been  hard  hit  by  the\r\n\r\ndeclining  interest  and valuation of  technology  companies.\r\n\r\nTheir  overall  market  capitalisation  has  fallen  sharply.\r\n\r\nToday,  technology companies are finding much more difficulty\r\n\r\nraising  funds  on  these boards.  We  can  look  at  several\r\n\r\nexamples.   Germany has the Neuer market, Korea  has  KOSDAQ,\r\n\r\nHongkong has GEM, Tokyo has the Mothers market, Malaysia  has\r\n\r\nMESDAQ.   The experience is mixed.  It is not clear  that  by\r\n\r\nputting  it  on a different board, you make the company  more\r\n\r\nsuccessful.   Yes, it was hot at the time when the  boom  and\r\n\r\nfrenzy  was on, but now the excitement has ebbed and many  of\r\n\r\nthese  boards  are  languishing, their  companies  and  their\r\n\r\nshares too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all the companies listed on SGX need be, or should\r\n\r\nbe,  established, safe, blue chip companies. There is nothing\r\n\r\nwrong  with  having  risky  start-ups  being  listed  on  the\r\n\r\nexchange,  alongside established names like SIA or DBS,  once\r\n\r\nthese\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstart-ups  reach a certain threshold size.  As  long  as  the\r\n\r\nrisk  is  an honest business risk, the company complies  with\r\n\r\nthe Exchange's listing rules and disclosure requirements, and\r\n\r\ntheir  shares  are  properly  traded  and  not  cornered   or\r\n\r\nmanipulated, then the Stock Exchange is fulfilling its proper\r\n\r\nfunction  -  providing a well-regulated marketplace  for  the\r\n\r\ncompany to raise equity capital from the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business risk is something which the investors have\r\n\r\nto  judge.  If it is a matter of dishonesty, fraud,  somebody\r\n\r\nrunning  away  with  the  bank's  money,  manipulating  their\r\n\r\nshares,  for  that kind of risk, we would do something  about\r\n\r\nit.   We would chase it up and put it right.  But if it is  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  risk  - I put forward a proposal, full  disclosure,\r\n\r\nyou  know  what I am trying to do, you know the dangers,  you\r\n\r\nput your money up, then I do not think we should stand in the\r\n\r\nway and require you to be separately listed or to prevent you\r\n\r\nfrom listing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in today's business environment, risk is no\r\n\r\nlonger  very  much  a  function of size and  recent  earnings\r\n\r\nprofile,   especially  for  technology  firms.    Large   and\r\n\r\nprofitable firms can also be risky because the conditions can\r\n\r\nchange  very  rapidly.  When SGX liberalised its criteria  to\r\n\r\nallow  more firms to list directly on the main board, it  was\r\n\r\nin effect saying that the main board was no longer a low-risk\r\n\r\nboard. Sesdaq then became a small cap board instead of a high-risk board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this is the correct approach for SGX to\r\n\r\ntake.  But it does raise the question of the need for SGX  to\r\n\r\nhave a separate small cap board. Sesdaq was launched to allow\r\n\r\nless well-established companies that did not qualify for  the\r\n\r\nmain  board  to  be  listed.  Now that SGX  has  revised  its\r\n\r\nlisting  criteria, many companies, which in  the  past  would\r\n\r\nhave  had  no  choice  but to list on Sesdaq,  can  now  list\r\n\r\ndirectly on the main board, although not all of them. SGX  is\r\n\r\ntherefore studying the proper role of Sesdaq, to review the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmerits  of continuing with two separate boards.  It  has  not\r\n\r\nreached any decision on the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, our law of\r\n\r\ninsurance  requires the insured to declare what he  knows  to\r\n\r\nthe  insurer if such knowledge has relevance to the insurer's\r\n\r\nassessment of the risks involved.   The impact of  this  rule\r\n\r\nextends  to the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) run by  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard  which,  in  law,  is another insurance  policy.   Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans sign their HPS documents as one of a whole stack\r\n\r\nof  papers they sign when they are allocated their HDB flats.\r\n\r\nThey are not specifically alerted to the nature of the HPS as\r\n\r\nan  insurance  policy.  Hence, they are totally  baffled  and\r\n\r\ndeeply  aggrieved when a breadwinner dies of  a  pre-existing\r\n\r\nmedical  condition, ie, existing before they signed  the  HPS\r\n\r\nand HDB papers, but which they have not disclosed at the time\r\n\r\nof signing of the papers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the same happens even when an insurance agent\r\n\r\nhas  properly  directed the attention of the insured  to  the\r\n\r\nduty of disclosure because of the vagueness of the parameters\r\n\r\nof this duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reference in our Insurance Act (Cap 142) to the\r\n\r\nduty  of  disclosure is in section 25(5), which  attempts  to\r\n\r\nameliorate the harshness of this common law rule. The section\r\n\r\nmandates that insurers who wish to rely on this rule ought to\r\n\r\ndisplay  prominently a warning that \"if a proposer  does  not\r\n\r\nfully  and faithfully give the facts as he knows of  them  or\r\n\r\nought to know them, he may receive nothing from this policy\".\r\n\r\nViolation  of this section results in a fine but the  insured\r\n\r\nstill is not entitled to payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this provision yet does not tell the insured what to\r\n\r\nsay, what part of his store of knowledge is relevant when  he\r\n\r\n\"proposes\"  to  enter  into a contract of  insurance.   Worse\r\n\r\nstill, the policy is void even if there is something he ought\r\n\r\nto know.  What ought a poorly educated man or woman \"ought to\r\n\r\nknow\"?  That  his  \"hong sip\" (Hokkien for  \"wind  and  wet\",\r\n\r\nreferring  to  a whole range of ailments from  rheumatism  to\r\n\r\narthritis) is something that he must declare because it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  kind of preliminary cancer?  What ought a well-educated\r\n\r\nnon-medical professional \"ought to know\", that disclosing his\r\n\r\nhigh  blood  pressure may not be the same  thing  in  medical\r\n\r\nscience  as  revealing  his ischemia  or  his  propensity  to\r\n\r\nmyocardiac infarction?\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In legal jargon, leaving aside medical jargon, the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  disclosure is that of the prudent insurer,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe  insured must disclose all facts which a prudent  insurer\r\n\r\nwill  want to know in assessing the risk.  How would a layman\r\n\r\nknow  what a prudent insurer requires?  In Australia  and  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia, the legislatures have amended the common  law  test\r\n\r\nto  one of what a  reasonable insured knows to be relevant to\r\n\r\nthe issue of risk.  This remains difficult to fulfill, but at\r\n\r\nleast  the  insured is not tested on his guess  on  what  the\r\n\r\ninsurer  wants to know; nor what the insured \"ought\" to  know\r\n\r\nbut nevertheless does not know until a court says he ought to\r\n\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to this question of insurance policies\r\n\r\nwhich  an  insurance company issues. Our policies are  chock-full   of   obscure   and  laborious   English,   not   plain\r\n\r\nconversational English.  NTUC Income has done a very good job\r\n\r\nof  simplifying its policies, but they are still hampered  by\r\n\r\nthe  fact that the law is painfully laden with language  from\r\n\r\nthe  ancient cases using language and a style of  English  no\r\n\r\nlonger  meaningful in the Third Millennium.  If  the  law  of\r\n\r\ninsurance  updates  and  simplifies its  language,  then  the\r\n\r\npolicies will follow suit.  Can we look at our neighbours and\r\n\r\nemulate them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, it is a common practice for many life\r\n\r\ninsurers  to  provide  a column for the proposed  insured  to\r\n\r\nnominate   a  beneficiary.   Unlike  CPF  nominations,   this\r\n\r\nnomination is not effective in disposing the proceeds of  the\r\n\r\npolicy  if  there  is  a  will  stating  otherwise.   As  for\r\n\r\nnominations in NTUC Income policies, these are valid  because\r\n\r\ntheir policies are not governed by the Insurance Act, but  by\r\n\r\nthe  Cooperative  Societies Act (Chapter  62).   Nonetheless,\r\n\r\nsuch nominations are not revoked by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarriage,  unlike the case with CPF nominations.  Then  there\r\n\r\nis  the  complication of nominations that take  effect  under\r\n\r\nsection  73  of  the  Conveyancing and Law  of  Property  Act\r\n\r\n(Chapter  61).  In the case of Eng Li Cheng Dolly v  Lim  Yeo\r\n\r\nHua,  reported  in [1995], 3 Singapore Law Reports  363,  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court held that a divorced wife was entitled to proceeds\r\n\r\nof  her  ex-husband's life policy, just because he had  named\r\n\r\nher  in the policy, despite the fact that he had divorced her\r\n\r\nand  had  intended  to remarry before he died.   Surely  this\r\n\r\ncould  not  have  been  his  intention?   Part  XIII  of  the\r\n\r\nInsurance  Act 1996 of Malaysia has 11 sections dealing  with\r\n\r\nnominations.  We have not a single section.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our convoluted law needs reform and consolidation in one\r\n\r\nAct  now.  Are we ready, Sir, for this mammoth task  for  the\r\n\r\nNew Millennium?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> General Lee, would you like to respond?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I am not familiar with all the\r\n\r\nChapters,  sections  and cases.  But I  would  say  that  the\r\n\r\nMember has raised valid concerns and these are matters  which\r\n\r\nwe will look into  -  all of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the burden of disclosure, the present\r\n\r\nsituation is, as Assoc. Prof. Toh has pointed out, to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they  have to display a warning that if the prospective\r\n\r\nbuyer  does  not fully and faithfully give the facts,  as  he\r\n\r\nknows  them  or ought to know them, he may stand  to  receive\r\n\r\nnothing  from  the policy.  There are concerns that  insurers\r\n\r\nmight  rely on this to be less than fair in their obligations\r\n\r\nto  policyholders.   And to make sure that policyholders  are\r\n\r\nnot  unfairly  treated,  the Life Insurance  Association  has\r\n\r\nissued an internal statement of practice, which requires that\r\n\r\nproposal  forms  of  all  life  insurance  companies  exclude\r\n\r\nquestions whose answers a prospective buyer cannot reasonably\r\n\r\nbe  expected to know, and which would not be practicable  for\r\n\r\nhim to obtain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also provides that the prospective buyer need not\r\n\r\nanswer any questions\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovided  that he states that he does not possess and  cannot\r\n\r\nreasonably be expected to obtain the information necessary to\r\n\r\nanswer   the   questions.   Also,  the  insurer  should   not\r\n\r\nunreasonably  reject a claim or invalidate a  policy  on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  of  non-disclosure or misrepresentation, unless  the\r\n\r\nfact is material and is within the knowledge of the proposer.\r\n\r\nAnd  for  that,  he is reasonably expected  to  disclose  it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  flawed,  deception,  reckless  or  negligent   non-disclosure  or  misrepresentation of  a  material  fact  will\r\n\r\nconstitute  grounds for rejection of a claim.   This  is  the\r\n\r\npresent  position.  So there is some safeguard.   Whether  we\r\n\r\nneed to change the law is something I will look into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of plain English, MAS supports this\r\n\r\ninitiative,   and  has  suggested  to  the   Life   Insurance\r\n\r\nAssociation to encourage members to adopt this practice,  and\r\n\r\nseveral  life insurance companies have already  begun  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.  And, again, we will see whether we need to change  the\r\n\r\nlaw itself, to make the law itself use plain English.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for beneficiaries, this is a problem, as the Member\r\n\r\ncorrectly  pointed  out.   NTUC Income  does  not  have  this\r\n\r\nproblem, because they are not an insurance company.  They are\r\n\r\na cooperative and therefore not covered by the insurance law,\r\n\r\nwhich  is surely not a good way to do things either.  Because\r\n\r\nit  should be covered by the insurance law, whether or not it\r\n\r\nis a cooperative.  So, we are looking, together with the Life\r\n\r\nInsurance  Association, the Ministry of Law and the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance, into the issue of providing greater  clarity  in\r\n\r\nthe nomination of beneficiaries for the proceeds of insurance\r\n\r\npolicies.  And when we amend the Insurance Act, we  will  fix\r\n\r\nall these matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, first, a point of\r\n\r\nclarification  to  the Deputy Prime  Minister.    As  I  have\r\n\r\npointed out in my speech, these insurance laws actually apply\r\n\r\nto  the Home Protection Scheme of the CPF.  These papers  are\r\n\r\nsigned in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nflurry  of  a  whole lot of papers in the HDB  office  before\r\n\r\nofficials  who are not directing their minds specifically  to\r\n\r\nthe  insurance point.  I get a lot of aggrieved residents who\r\n\r\ncome to me and say, \"My husband just died.  Now I cannot  pay\r\n\r\nfor  my flat, because the HPS does not pay, even though  they\r\n\r\nsaid  that they were supposed to pay.  And that's because  my\r\n\r\nhusband did not declare this disease that he had.\"  Would the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister also ask the authorities to look  into\r\n\r\nthis  issue of both the procedure and the law where HDB flats\r\n\r\nare concerned?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, we will have to look and see\r\n\r\nwhether  the HDB officers, making house buyers sign  the  HPS\r\n\r\nforms,  would  count  as  insurance agents  and  need  to  be\r\n\r\nproperly qualified for that purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I move on to my next cut\r\n\r\non  electronic payments.  First, I have this point  to  make,\r\n\r\nthat  for electronic payments to take place, we have to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that the old habits based on paper have to be  removed.\r\n\r\nAll of us know that cheques have become a very important part\r\n\r\nof the business life, and even the personal lives of a lot of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  of people around the world.   Cheques  are\r\n\r\npaper  payment  instruments which, by  law,  are  negotiable.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sir, I think it has escaped the notice of many\r\n\r\npeople  that the cheques that are issued, and  I believe  the\r\n\r\nbulk  of cheques issued today, are not negotiable.  They  are\r\n\r\ncrossed  and  are made payable to \"Account Payee  Only\",  and\r\n\r\nthese   cheques,   essentially,  then  become  non-negotiable\r\n\r\npayment instruments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS has talked about the movement to truncate\r\n\r\ncheques, because moving of paper in such volumes is not good.\r\n\r\nBut  in  order  for the electronic clearance  of  such  paper\r\n\r\ncheques to be done, in other words, for the procedures to  be\r\n\r\ntruncated, the law has to be changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while thinking about changing the law relating to\r\n\r\nbills of exchange and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhow to truncate them, could I urge the Government to look  at\r\n\r\na  totally new paradigm, perhaps initially legislating for  a\r\n\r\npayment  order?   In Australia, I understand that  they  have\r\n\r\ndone  this.  They have removed cheques altogether in the form\r\n\r\nof negotiable cheques and legislated for a payment order.  If\r\n\r\na  payment order is merely an instruction to the bank to  pay\r\n\r\nand  it  is  not negotiable, therefore, all the  problems  on\r\n\r\nnegotiability  and  hindrances to electronifying  the  cheque\r\n\r\nwould be gone.  Perhaps we could be even more radical and  be\r\n\r\nlike  Finland  which, in 1996, abolished the cheque  totally,\r\n\r\nand  only allowed for electronic payments.  Perhaps  the  MAS\r\n\r\ncould look into how many cheques are actually drawn each  day\r\n\r\nwhich  are  still  negotiable and  provide  for  those  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to make is that in the payment\r\n\r\ninfrastructure that we have in place right now for electronic\r\n\r\npayments,  our  \"killer application\", DPM Lee  has  mentioned\r\n\r\nhimself in this House, is the ERP system.  So we developed  a\r\n\r\ncard system which is a form of electronic payment system  for\r\n\r\nthe ERP.  And then we developed a separate system for use  on\r\n\r\ntrains  and buses.  There is a rumour -  perhaps rumours  are\r\n\r\nnot  true   -   that the ERP itself would change  to  a  chip\r\n\r\nrather than a card.  And then what is not a rumour is that by\r\n\r\n2008,  we  are planning to have electronic legal tender.   My\r\n\r\nconcern  is that all these piecemeal changes to practice  and\r\n\r\npiecemeal  introduction of electronic payment systems  should\r\n\r\nnot  happen,  because they should all be  building  from  one\r\n\r\ncommon  base,  and  therefore the killer  applications  could\r\n\r\ngrow.   I  hope that we would not have different card systems\r\n\r\nand   different  payment  systems  for  Internet,  for   ERP,\r\n\r\ntransport and perhaps an inter-agency coordinating body would\r\n\r\nbe  necessary for such payments, so that by the time we  have\r\n\r\nour electronic legal tender, the infrastructure does not have\r\n\r\nto be reinvented and recreated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member. On\r\n\r\ncheques, I do not think we are ready to abolish cheques.   We\r\n\r\nsupport the initiatives to discourage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncheque  usage,  but we do not think we can  abolish  cheques,\r\n\r\nbecause  in  many  situations,  cheques  remain  the  payment\r\n\r\ninstrument that makes the most sense.  One day, there may  be\r\n\r\nnew  payment methods that are cheaper, safe, more accessible.\r\n\r\nI  think we can study how the Australians and the Finns  have\r\n\r\ndone, but I do not think we are quite ready for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of electronic transactions has been growing\r\n\r\nrapidly   now  in  terms  of  number  of  transactions.    E-transactions have exceeded the number of cheques every  year.\r\n\r\nOf course, in terms of total dollar amounts, it is much less,\r\n\r\nbecause   e-transactions  tend  to  be  for   little   retail\r\n\r\npurchases.   But the number of transactions has been  growing\r\n\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are encouraging e-payment innovations and improving\r\n\r\nthe  efficiency  of  existing  payment  infrastructure.   For\r\n\r\nexample, we are facilitating cheque truncation, scanning  the\r\n\r\ncheque at the starting point and after that dealing just with\r\n\r\nthe  digital form, rather than the piece of paper circulating\r\n\r\naround.   And we are also working with all the other agencies\r\n\r\nto encourage competition and innovation in e-payments  - IDA,\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Communications  and  Information  Technology,\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance, BCCS and so on, so that we will  try  to\r\n\r\navoid having inconsistent overlapping pieces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are supporting the initiative by NETS and its five\r\n\r\nshareholder banks to restructure its ownership structure  and\r\n\r\ncorporate  governance in order to take on new and  innovative\r\n\r\nfunctions,  and  to  make  NETS the premier  payment  service\r\n\r\nprovider  within and beyond Singapore.  NETS is currently  in\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with potential partners who can bring  expertise,\r\n\r\ntechnology and global connections.  When it finds a strategic\r\n\r\npartner  and new management structures, a revamped NETS  will\r\n\r\nbe  more  effective  in  promoting  electronic  payments  and\r\n\r\nproving   the   efficiency   of   payment   instruments   and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, introducing new payment methods, and so  move\r\n\r\nus towards a cashless society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for smart cards, right now, the only multi-purpose\r\n\r\nstored  value card we have in Singapore is the NETS CashCard,\r\n\r\nwhich  is based on the contact card technology.  But  LTA  is\r\n\r\nbeginning  to install infrastructure to support  the  use  of\r\n\r\ncontactless  smart card technology for its own  stored  value\r\n\r\ncard  in  the  transit systems, buses and, in future,  retail\r\n\r\nshops.  They are different.  One is contact, and the other is\r\n\r\ncontactless.   LTA  is  choosing the contactless  technology,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  allows  commuters to pass  through  the  transit\r\n\r\nsystem  quickly, without breaking their stride.  They do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to stop.  They just swish their wallet or their handbag\r\n\r\nover  the turnstile and the transaction is completed.  It  is\r\n\r\nlike driving under the ERP gantry, swift and painless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that this will result in people having to\r\n\r\ncarry two different stored value cards.  Unfortunately,  this\r\n\r\ncannot be helped for the time being, because the combi-cards,\r\n\r\nwhich  combines both the contact and non-contact capabilities\r\n\r\non a single card, are still new.  Their technical performance\r\n\r\nand  commercial viability of the combi-card is not tested and\r\n\r\nproven  on a wide scale.  But we are looking ahead, and  MCIT\r\n\r\nand  MAS  have been encouraging the Land Transport Authority,\r\n\r\nthe  transit operators and NETS to work together  to  prepare\r\n\r\nfor  using a single combi-card throughout Singapore once  the\r\n\r\ntechnology is ready.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Prof. Toh's query about the card in the ERP being\r\n\r\nreplaced by a chip, I have not heard about it.

I feel that there is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nraise  this  issue for further discussion because  it  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  topic  with major impact on the  yearly  financial\r\n\r\nplans of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have examined the budget surpluses of the Government\r\n\r\nin the last five years.  The figures are as follows: FY 1996,\r\n\r\nthe surplus was $5.6 billion; FY 1997, $6.1 billion; FY 1998,\r\n\r\n-  $0.4  billion (this was a recession year); FY  1999,  $0.9\r\n\r\nbillion; and FY 2000, $3.5 billion.  The forecast for FY 2001\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus is $4.4 billion.  Based on the above figures,\r\n\r\nit  can be seen that the Government has performed exceedingly\r\n\r\nwell  to  achieve consistently substantial budget  surpluses,\r\n\r\nexcept  for 1998 which was a recession year.  If we take  the\r\n\r\ntotal of these surpluses in the last five years, the sum is a\r\n\r\nhefty  $15.7  billion, which is nearly 10% of the  year  2000\r\n\r\nGDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these substantial surpluses, the Government has\r\n\r\nmuch flexibility in terms of the actions and policies it  can\r\n\r\npursue.  Therefore, it has the following key advantages:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Flexibility and freedom to pursue Government\r\n\r\npolicies and objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Ability to implement wealth redistribution policies that\r\n\r\nenable the Government to give help to the poor and needy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Ability to build up a substantial national reserve that\r\n\r\ncan  be used to cushion against uncertainties and the ability\r\n\r\nto act against external interferences and exigencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is more remarkable about our substantial\r\n\r\nbudget surplus is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  attained  after accounting  not  only  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's annual operating expenditure but also  inclusive\r\n\r\nof  total annual developmental expenditure.  As a result,  we\r\n\r\nhave  no foreign debt which is the primary reason why we  are\r\n\r\nnot adversely affected by the recent Asian financial crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, the substantial budget surpluses also pose\r\n\r\nconcerns in some aspects.  Allow me to elaborate.  The  areas\r\n\r\nof concern are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Each year, the actual surplus achieved is typically\r\n\r\nhigher  than  the original forecast of the annual  Government\r\n\r\nbudget.   It may mean that the various Ministries are  unable\r\n\r\nto  plan  accurately their annual incomes  and  expenditures.\r\n\r\nThis  tendency  is  not  desirable,  as  some  Ministries  or\r\n\r\ndepartments could be deprived of funds for their projects and\r\n\r\nprogrammes, because other Ministries asked for more money and\r\n\r\ndid   not  utilize  the  funds  in  the  end.   The  affected\r\n\r\nMinistries  could  well be the welfare  and  social  services\r\n\r\ngroup  as  they  tend  to  be lower down  the  priority  list\r\n\r\ncompared with the economic agencies.  So I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister whether the Government budget  planning\r\n\r\nprocess  can  be tightened.  Those Ministries and departments\r\n\r\nthat   over-budgeted   and  did  not  fully   utilize   their\r\n\r\nallocations should be queried and taken to task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) On the Government income side, the budget surplus\r\n\r\ncould  well  have the adverse impact of over-drawing  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   taxes,  charges,  levies  and  fees.    On   the\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure side, there could be under-spending of\r\n\r\nthe  expenditures,  especially in  development  projects  and\r\n\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both situations are not desirable. On the one hand,\r\n\r\nover-charging and over-collection of Government  income  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government can be over-taxing the people  and  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   If  taxes or levies are lowered further,  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government could afford to, more money could be left  in\r\n\r\nthe  hands of the people and the businesses who can then have\r\n\r\nmore  money  to  spend on their needs.   This  will  help  to\r\n\r\nstimulate the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if the Government's development expenditures\r\n\r\nare  unintentionally  curtailed  because  of  poor  budgetary\r\n\r\nplanning, then there will be a contractionary effect  on  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   At  least, the economy could have been  stimulated\r\n\r\nfurther  through  higher capital expenditures  on  worthwhile\r\n\r\nGovernment projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my comments above are of course predicated on the\r\n\r\nunderstanding that I am not advocating mindless and  wasteful\r\n\r\nspending.    We   value  frugality  and   prudency   in   our\r\n\r\nexpenditures  are  virtues.  I am also aware  that  excessive\r\n\r\nspending can cause the evil of inflation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the complexity of the issues, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for his comments on how he would deal with  the\r\n\r\nsubstantial surpluses, and whether measures will be taken  to\r\n\r\nimprove the Government's budget planning and funds allocation\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to make a few\r\n\r\nsuggestions on how we make further improvements  to  our  tax\r\n\r\nsystem as we enter into the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to suggest that we allow all new\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  have  a  10-year  average  tax  plan  so  that\r\n\r\ncompanies  which do not enjoy any of the EDB  tax  incentives\r\n\r\n(like pioneer status, business HQ tax status, and others) can\r\n\r\nenjoy  an effectively low tax during that period.  We  should\r\n\r\nallow  companies to carry forward losses within this  10-year\r\n\r\nperiod,  and  the  system  can  also  be  flexible  to  allow\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels  of tax rate depending  on  which  year  of\r\n\r\noperation   the  company  is.   This  will  basically   allow\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  have a smoother start-up with less  burden  on\r\n\r\ntheir cash flow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry should allow pre-production\r\n\r\nexpenses  to be tax-deductible and allow interest income  for\r\n\r\nthe  first few years of operations for such companies  to  be\r\n\r\ntax  exempt  or  tax  deductible.  The reason  is  that  many\r\n\r\ncompanies,  especially the capital intensive  companies,  may\r\n\r\nraise  substantial  funds upfront for use for  future  years.\r\n\r\nThey  have  to  raise  such  funds  because  of  the  capital\r\n\r\nintensive nature of their companies.  But\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen  they  do  that the money basically  sits  in  the  bank\r\n\r\nearning interest, but we are taxing them for all this.  It is\r\n\r\nprudent  for  them to do so and we should not  penalise  such\r\n\r\ncompanies from raising funds early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also raised some suggestions on enhancing Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition as a manufacturing hub during the Budget debate.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the Minister will study these suggestions and take them\r\n\r\ninto  account when he implements changes to any of the future\r\n\r\ntax system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage individual enterprise and to create a\r\n\r\nculture where every Singaporean thinks as an entrepreneur,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest the following three schemes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I suggest that we introduce a negative gearing\r\n\r\nscheme  where individuals can write off expenditures  related\r\n\r\nto  individual  business related activities, like  when  they\r\n\r\nrent  out  their  premises or do some part-time  business  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  their  income.  In this way,  when  it  comes  to\r\n\r\npaying  taxes, individuals will behave like businesses,  thus\r\n\r\ndeveloping a sense of enterprise within themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should allow individuals and entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nto  carry forward losses resulting from investments they made\r\n\r\nin  start-up  companies so that they  can  reduce  their  tax\r\n\r\nburden in future years.  This would eliminate the risk averse\r\n\r\nnature of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while I am very happy to see the progressive\r\n\r\ntax  incentives  for stock options, I would like  to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the individuals and employees be taxed upon realisation\r\n\r\nof their gains when they encash their shares rather than when\r\n\r\nthey exercise their options.  While the current system allows\r\n\r\nfor  delay of up to three years of exercise, should they make\r\n\r\na paper gain, in fact, the paper gain could actually become a\r\n\r\nloss depending on the market conditions some years later, and\r\n\r\nthis  will create a burden for the individuals when they have\r\n\r\nto  pay  tax  on the gain that they made when  in  fact  they\r\n\r\nactually did not gain anything when they sold their shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, this year's Budget\r\n\r\ncan  be  said to have given a double bonus to the individuals\r\n\r\nbecause in this year they not only get a personal income  tax\r\n\r\ncut  of  between 2% and 5%, but also a 10% rebate on the  tax\r\n\r\npayable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to point out certain anomalies in the\r\n\r\nmanner  our  tax  reliefs are worked out.  In  most  families\r\n\r\ntoday,  maids are employed to assist in looking  after  young\r\n\r\nchildren.   Under the present provision, a married woman  who\r\n\r\nemploys  a maid to look after her children is entitled  to  a\r\n\r\ntax relief of up to $8,280.  This works out to about $690 per\r\n\r\nmonth  on average.  In comparison, someone who cannot  afford\r\n\r\nor  is  not willing to employ a maid, can only claim a  child\r\n\r\nrelief of $2,000 for each of the first three children,  which\r\n\r\nworks out to an average of $166 a month per child.  I am sure\r\n\r\nall  of  you will agree with me that it takes much more  than\r\n\r\nthis amount to raise a child.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please do not get me wrong. I fully understand the\r\n\r\nrationale behind why the foreign maid tax was levied,  and  I\r\n\r\nam  not asking for more tax reliefs.  All I am asking for  is\r\n\r\nfor the Ministry of Finance to review the child relief and to\r\n\r\nmake  it more realistic in a more proportionate way.   So  in\r\n\r\nthis way, in addition to the \"baby bonus\", it would also be a\r\n\r\nstrategy to encourage more families to have children\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the moment, the foreign maid relief is\r\n\r\napplicable  only  to  the women.  I find  it  a  bit  strange\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are  always  talking about  equality  of  sexes.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  nowadays husbands are expected  to  perform  their\r\n\r\nfair  share of duties at home.  So, should we not extend  the\r\n\r\nforeign  maid relief  to the husbands as well, in  the  event\r\n\r\nthat  they  were given custody of the children in  a  divorce\r\n\r\nsituation  or where the spouses have passed away.  They  need\r\n\r\nto  work too and will definitely require a maid to look after\r\n\r\ntheir children.  I hope the Minister would consider this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the parent relief scheme. The current\r\n\r\nprovision only permits one sibling\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  claim  relief for looking after his or her  parents.   We\r\n\r\nknow  in  reality  that in Singapore nowadays,  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the parents is normally spread among  several\r\n\r\nsiblings.   As  such, should the scheme not  be  adjusted  to\r\n\r\nreflect the actual scenario by allowing more than one sibling\r\n\r\nto  claim  the  amount?   Perhaps the one  with  the  parents\r\n\r\nstaying  in  his house could claim higher relief,  while  the\r\n\r\nother siblings claim lower reliefs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the Government has announced\r\n\r\nthe  reduction  of  the property tax rate from  12%  to  10%.\r\n\r\nHowever,  at the same time, the 25% property tax  rebate  was\r\n\r\nremoved.   The net effect is that except for the  residential\r\n\r\nsector, the commercial, office and industrial sectors do  not\r\n\r\nhave any gain in the property tax reduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a higher benefit to the businesses and property\r\n\r\nowners,  it  would have been more appreciated if the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister could have done both, that is, to lower the property\r\n\r\ntax rate and, at the same time, give a rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, property tax is originally conceived as a form of\r\n\r\nwealth tax.  However, the function of the property tax  as  a\r\n\r\nwealth  tax  is partially diminished since most  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nown  their homes, 93% to be exact; as HDB dwellers are mostly\r\n\r\nhome  owners  as  well.  Hence, it may be opportune  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to reconsider the use of property tax as a  wealth\r\n\r\ntax.   Although  the  negative effect  is  mitigated  by  the\r\n\r\nreduction of property tax for owner occupied properties,  the\r\n\r\neffect of property tax for non-residential area, that is, for\r\n\r\ncommercial,  office  and industrial, is that  it  essentially\r\n\r\nbecomes a cost factor.  Property tax has an impact on  rental\r\n\r\ncharges  as  property owners normally on-charge the  cost  of\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  to  the  tenants.  This cost  factor  adds  to\r\n\r\noverall business costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question to the Minister is that if property tax\r\n\r\nis  losing  its  purpose as a wealth tax, and  tends  to  add\r\n\r\ntowards  operating  cost, I would like to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he  would  review  the  role  of  property  tax  and\r\n\r\neventually reduce it to a lower level over time.  In the long\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nterm, is there a need for property tax, since income tax  and\r\n\r\nGST  are  serving the main functions of direct  and  indirect\r\n\r\ntaxes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, until the dot-com mania, only a\r\n\r\nsmall  percentage of companies have issued stock  options  as\r\n\r\npart  of  an employee's compensation package, purportedly  to\r\n\r\nalign workers' interest with companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, the Minister has moved swiftly\r\n\r\nto  make  the  tax  environment here more  conducive  to  the\r\n\r\nissuance  of stock options.  The Singapore Exchange has  also\r\n\r\nput  in  place a framework for listed companies,  to  operate\r\n\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, many top vacancies at dot-coms now go a\r\n\r\nbegging,  despite packages which are heavy on  stock  options\r\n\r\nand which used to be the carrot for many a bright candidate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In structuring our tax incentives, I would like to\r\n\r\nhumbly  suggest  to  the Minister to examine  the  signalling\r\n\r\neffect,  especially  in  the light  of  the  emerging  equity\r\n\r\nculture  in  Singapore.  Sir, I recognise that a  balance  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  strike.  I recall the cries of  my  colleagues\r\n\r\nurging  the Minister to give entrepreneurship a boost in  the\r\n\r\narm by offering generous tax incentives, especially for start-ups.   Offering  too much of a tax incentive,  on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  might  unwittingly signal to employees at  large  that\r\n\r\nstock options are superior to wages or even bonuses paid  out\r\n\r\nin  cash.  The understanding of how the upside or downside to\r\n\r\nstock  options is linked to a company's performance  may  not\r\n\r\nhave been as complete as what we are hoping for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing alternatives to implementing the  intended\r\n\r\nextension  of  tax  incentives  to  companies  issuing  stock\r\n\r\noptions  to  at  least half of their employees.   Whilst  the\r\n\r\nintention  may  be  to  spread tax incentives  as  widely  as\r\n\r\npossible,  from the signalling perspective, it  would  appear\r\n\r\nthat the Government prefers the wide use of stock options  to\r\n\r\njust  issuing to top executives.  Some preliminary study  has\r\n\r\nindeed indicated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat corporations that offer options to the majority, instead\r\n\r\nof  a  few, tended to enjoy significantly higher productivity\r\n\r\nlevels  and annual growth rates.  However, in the context  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  where both companies and individuals may  not  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for  that scale of stock option participation,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  may want to allow a modification of the  \"at  least\r\n\r\nhalf\" requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin Boon Ann is not here. Mr Leong\r\n\r\nHorn Kee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, many of my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and  I  have  spoken on  the  need  to  help  the\r\n\r\npensioners during the Budget debate.  In my speech during the\r\n\r\nBudget debate, I mentioned that retired pensioners are a pool\r\n\r\nof  past contributors who had toiled hard to help the country\r\n\r\nachieve economic growth and nation building, at salaries that\r\n\r\nwere generally below market rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned also that the $1.7 million given to\r\n\r\npensioners as adjustment of the Singapore Allowance and gross\r\n\r\npension ceiling is paltry compared to the budget surpluses of\r\n\r\n$3.5  billion.   The Finance Minister, I am   certain,  could\r\n\r\nhave and should have been more generous to the pensioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to plead harder again for the plight of the\r\n\r\npensioners.   Assuming a pensioner retired 10  years  ago  in\r\n\r\n1990  and  had  a pension of $1,000.  In the last  10  years,\r\n\r\ninflation  rate, as represented by the accumulative  rise  in\r\n\r\nthe  Consumer Price Index (CPI), has increased  by  17%.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the national average monthly income of Singaporean\r\n\r\nhouseholds  has  increased by 74%, from  $9,670  in  1990  to\r\n\r\n$16,800  in  year 2000.  If we combine the two factors,  that\r\n\r\nis, of rising inflation and the increase in household income,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see that a pensioner with no other sources of income\r\n\r\nwill fall behind other Singaporeans by a good 91%, that is by\r\n\r\nadding  the  two  figures together.  That  actually  means  a\r\n\r\n$1,000  pension in 1990, would roughly diminish by about  50%\r\n\r\nin  today's value, compared to the other economically  active\r\n\r\nhouseholds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not advocating an indexation scheme to peg\r\n\r\npensions with yearly adjustments.  This is not right.  What I\r\n\r\nam  requesting is that, in good years, when all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  rewarded with pay rise and NWC adjustments to  salaries,\r\n\r\nwe  should not forget the pensioners.  At present, there  are\r\n\r\nabout  12,000 pensioners.  Because of the conversion to  full\r\n\r\nCPF scheme, the number of pensioners will diminish over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like to ask the Finance Minister, since\r\n\r\nthis  year  he has not given very much to the pensioners,  in\r\n\r\nfact a very meagre sum as benefit to them, perhaps next year,\r\n\r\nhe  can surely do more for them, and particularly, since next\r\n\r\nyear he is budgeting a higher surplus of $4.4 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, most people are quite happy with\r\n\r\nthis year's budget and with the generosity that was given  to\r\n\r\nthem  by  the Minister for Finance.  But our people are  very\r\n\r\nconcerned that what the Minister for Finance gives out,  will\r\n\r\nbe  taken  away by other Ministries, statutory  boards,  shop\r\n\r\nowners  and others, and very soon, they will have a negative,\r\n\r\nrather  than positive reaction.  And the tendency to increase\r\n\r\nfees  and prices has already started, whether it is hospitals\r\n\r\nor other places, they have already started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we would like to ask the Ministry to please monitor\r\n\r\nthese price increases and do not just pass every increase  on\r\n\r\nto  the  consumers, the poor man-in-the-street.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nbudget surplus of $4.4 billion anticipated for this year, and\r\n\r\nit is expected to be 23% of Government operating expenditure,\r\n\r\nincluding running costs and transfers.  There is some  buffer\r\n\r\nto  absorb  some  of  these unforeseen increases  or  planned\r\n\r\nincreases.  There can also be productivity increases.  So  in\r\n\r\nthis  budget,  it  is important that the  feel  good  factors\r\n\r\nshould  continue to the end of the year, and that  we  should\r\n\r\nhave it at least carried on to the next Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my plea again is: let it not be said that what the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  gives us is only  waiting  for  other\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  statutory boards and companies  to  take  it\r\n\r\naway.  Please do not do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\non  the  question  raised  by Mr Leong  Horn  Kee  on  budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses and whether the recent large surpluses might result\r\n\r\nin  a liquidity squeeze on the economy, let me just start  by\r\n\r\nreassuring Members that the budget surpluses were not brought\r\n\r\nabout  by higher taxes.  I have said this many times  in  the\r\n\r\npast and I will repeat it again.  We have, in fact, over  the\r\n\r\nyears, been reducing taxes to keep them competitive and it is\r\n\r\nnot  our  intention to create budget surpluses by  increasing\r\n\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I have explained to the House the difficulty\r\n\r\nof forecasting revenue, and it has become even more difficult\r\n\r\nnowadays because the world changes very rapidly.  I have said\r\n\r\nthat our revenue growth strongly correlates to GDP growth and\r\n\r\nour   ability  to  forecast  revenue  is  therefore   heavily\r\n\r\ndependent  on the accuracy of our forecast of the  growth  of\r\n\r\nthe economies of our major trading partners and, in turn,  on\r\n\r\ntheir demand for our export products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should note that the Singapore economy is\r\n\r\nstrongly export oriented with external demand accounting  for\r\n\r\nover  55%  of  GDP.   In  the  United  States,  which  is   a\r\n\r\ncontinental economy much less dependent on exports,  even  Mr\r\n\r\nGreenspan,  Chairman  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Board,   has\r\n\r\ndifficulty in forecasting the growth of the US economy.   How\r\n\r\nmuch more difficult it is for us to have to forecast not only\r\n\r\nwhat  the  US  economy will do, but of all the other  trading\r\n\r\npartners' economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these inherent difficulties, we have been\r\n\r\ngenerally conservative in our forecast of GDP growth,  as  it\r\n\r\nis  important that we do not base our expenditure  programmes\r\n\r\non income levels which may not be realised.  In order to keep\r\n\r\nGovernment   expenditure  under   control,   we   have   kept\r\n\r\nGovernment's  recurrent expenditures at around  10%  of  GDP.\r\n\r\nAnd  in  recent years, we have been able to live within  this\r\n\r\ncap.  However, Government's development expenditures are  not\r\n\r\nsubject  to  any specific cap because they are project-based,\r\n\r\nand we invest in basic infrastructure as and when they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneeded  and  can be economically justified.  In  most  years,\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure has been around 6%-7%  of  GDP.   On\r\n\r\nthis basis, we would normally expect a budget surplus of  1%-2%  of GDP.  However, if our economy grows much more strongly\r\n\r\nthan  forecast because of exceptional external demand, as  it\r\n\r\ndid  in  1999  and the year 2000, we would end up  with  much\r\n\r\nlarger budget surpluses.  I consider such a development as  a\r\n\r\nbonus  of  good fortune to be enjoyed, and not to be lamented\r\n\r\nas a consequence of poor budget forecasting.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of whether budget surpluses would have a\r\n\r\ncontractionary  effect  on the economy,  the  answer  is  no,\r\n\r\nbecause there are no signs of contractionary pressures on the\r\n\r\neconomy  at this time.  Our interest rates have remained  low\r\n\r\nand there is no shortage of funds.  The economy has recovered\r\n\r\nsharply from the 1997/98 crisis, with solid performances over\r\n\r\nthe  past  two years.  I would also remind Members  that,  in\r\n\r\naddition to domestic liquidity, we also have large inflows of\r\n\r\nforeign  direct  investments, which have averaged  some  S$79\r\n\r\nbillion  over  the  period  1990-1998.   So,  liquidity   and\r\n\r\navailability  of  funds  for investment  have  never  been  a\r\n\r\nproblem for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has proposed several innovative tax\r\n\r\nchanges to promote enterprise in the new economy, and we will\r\n\r\ntake  his suggestions into consideration when we next  review\r\n\r\nour tax system.  His proposals are directed at lightening the\r\n\r\nfinancial  and tax burdens of companies in their early  years\r\n\r\nso  as  to promote their development.  He has suggested  that\r\n\r\nall  new  companies  which do not enjoy  EDB  tax  incentives\r\n\r\nshould  be given a 10-year tax honeymoon, during which losses\r\n\r\ncan  be carried forward and companies are taxed at low  rates\r\n\r\naccording to their individual income profile.  While  such  a\r\n\r\nproposal is clearly very helpful to these companies,  such  a\r\n\r\nflexible  tax system will create problems of equity  and  tax\r\n\r\ntreatment, and will be administratively very complicated too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of what he has asked for, such as the carrying\r\n\r\nforward of losses, are already\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\navailable.  Under existing provisions of the Income Tax  Act,\r\n\r\nlosses are already allowed to be carried forward without  any\r\n\r\ntime limitation, as long as the shareholders, in the year the\r\n\r\nlosses  are  absorbed, are not substantially  different  from\r\n\r\nthose in the year the losses were incurred.  Also, under  the\r\n\r\npartial tax exemption scheme, which will be effective in  the\r\n\r\nYear  of  Assessment  2002,  start-up  companies  will  enjoy\r\n\r\nsubstantially lower tax rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of pre-production expenses and interest\r\n\r\nincome,  I should point out that expenses incurred to acquire\r\n\r\ninvestments  do  not  qualify  for  tax  deductions,  if  the\r\n\r\ninvestments  do not produce income.  This is a tax  principle\r\n\r\nprovided  under  the provisions of the Income  Tax  Act  and,\r\n\r\nwhere  income is produced, the expenses incurred are  allowed\r\n\r\nas  a deduction against that income.  We will take a look  at\r\n\r\nthis again, but I think the principle would be very difficult\r\n\r\nto  change,  as  there may be a lot of adverse  consequences.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  any expense arising before the production  day\r\n\r\nis  not  allowable and, conversely, any income arising before\r\n\r\nthis  day  is also not subject to tax, since the  company  is\r\n\r\nconsidered as not having commenced business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax-wise, the most important thing the Government can do\r\n\r\nto  nurture  entrepreneurial behaviour  is  to  keep  up  our\r\n\r\npersonal  income taxes at a low level so as not to discourage\r\n\r\nhard  work and enterprise.  Our tax rates are already one  of\r\n\r\nthe lowest in the world before the latest Budget announcement\r\n\r\nfor   individual  income  tax  cuts.   There  are  also   tax\r\n\r\nconcessions   to   make   the  environment   favourable   for\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, eg, through making employee  stock  options\r\n\r\nattractive,  allowing individuals doing businesses  to  treat\r\n\r\nthemselves   as   businesses   when   computing   their   tax\r\n\r\nliabilities, and allowing individuals to deduct the  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred during the course of their businesses against  their\r\n\r\nincome.   To  change  the  system to  one  where  we  have  a\r\n\r\nmultitude of deductibles in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npersonal taxes will, as I said earlier, highly complicate our\r\n\r\ntax  system.  Singapore is the envy of many countries because\r\n\r\nof  the simplicity of our tax framework, which results  in  a\r\n\r\nhigh   degree  of  compliance  and  predictability   of   tax\r\n\r\nliabilities.   I think it is far better for us  to  take  the\r\n\r\napproach  of  reducing the rate of tax overall,  rather  than\r\n\r\nvary  tax  rates depending on how well individuals  make  out\r\n\r\ntheir accounts and argue their cases.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.23 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On share options, I believe that taxing at the point-of-exercise is a fairer method than taxing at the point-of-sale,\r\n\r\nparticularly  since  we  do not have  capital  gains  tax  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Let me explain.  If we tax at the  point-of-sale\r\n\r\nand  the  share price is higher at sale than at the point-of-exercise, there would be an additional tax equivalent to  the\r\n\r\ndifference  in  price.  This, in effect,  imposes  a  capital\r\n\r\ngains  tax.   Secondly,  taxing at the  point-of-exercise  is\r\n\r\nfair,  because  the  employee becomes a legal  owner  of  the\r\n\r\nshares  upon  exercise.  What the individual  chooses  to  do\r\n\r\nafter  that,  is  a  separate decision.   Once  the  employee\r\n\r\nexercises  the option and owns the shares, he is  subject  to\r\n\r\nthe  same risks in price fluctuations as other investors  who\r\n\r\nbuy  the  shares from the open market.  Although the employee\r\n\r\nalso  faces a tax bill as a result of exercising the options,\r\n\r\nhe  could dispose enough of the shares to set aside money  to\r\n\r\npay  the tax.  This is a wise move.  Many option holders,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  exercise and sell at least some portion of the  shares\r\n\r\nat  the  same time, possibly to raise funds to pay off  their\r\n\r\nfuture  tax  liability  but, mostly, to  reduce  their  risks\r\n\r\nshould prices go down in future.  I think the balance between\r\n\r\nrisk and reward is best left for each individual to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng has commented on the tax rebates for\r\n\r\nindividuals, both on maid relief and parent relief.   On  the\r\n\r\nissue of maid relief, in most families, maids are employed to\r\n\r\nlook  after  young children.  Under the category  of  foreign\r\n\r\nmaid relief, a married woman who employs a maid to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlook  after the children is able to claim up to $8,280.  This\r\n\r\nworks out to be about $690 per month on average.  Compare  it\r\n\r\nwith someone who cannot afford or is not willing to employ  a\r\n\r\nmaid  to look after her children, can only claim a relief  of\r\n\r\n$2,000  for each child.  He says this would work  out  to  an\r\n\r\naverage  of  $166  per month and, therefore,  appears  to  be\r\n\r\nmanifestly unfair.  Let me point out that tax reliefs are not\r\n\r\nmeant  to  compensate  taxpayers for any particular  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred.   They are only meant as a form of recognition  for\r\n\r\nthe  individual's  expenditures  in  specific  areas.   Child\r\n\r\nrelief is recognition for the care of one's child.  It should\r\n\r\nnot  be  compared to maid relief, which is part  of  a  wider\r\n\r\npackage  of tax incentives to encourage and facilitate  women\r\n\r\nto  have  more  children but still continue to work  if  they\r\n\r\nwish.   A husband whose spouse has passed away, can apply  to\r\n\r\nemploy  a  maid  to  take  care of  his  children.   This  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the purpose of the maid relief, which  is  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate married women to raise a family and to continue to\r\n\r\nwork at the same time.  Hence, maid relief is not extended to\r\n\r\ntheir husbands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of tax rebates for individuals to look\r\n\r\nafter  their parents, it is not clear to me exactly  what  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Ah  Heng is asking for when he says that more  than  one\r\n\r\nsibling  should  be allowed to make the same  claim.   Is  he\r\n\r\nsuggesting that each sibling should ask for the same  amount,\r\n\r\nie,  $3,500 multiplied by the number of siblings,  or  should\r\n\r\nthey  be  allowed to share this relief, which is $3,500,  for\r\n\r\nsomeone  who  does not live with the parents, or  $5,000  for\r\n\r\nsomeone  who lives with the parents?  I do not think  we  can\r\n\r\nallow  multiple claims because it would mean a huge  increase\r\n\r\nin  the  amount  of  relief.  So I am assuming  the  question\r\n\r\nreally is:  how should the relief be claimed or shared?   The\r\n\r\nexisting  guideline  allows only one sibling  to  claim  this\r\n\r\nrelief.   This  stipulation is a practical one.   It  assumes\r\n\r\nthat  the siblings would decide amongst themselves who should\r\n\r\nclaim  the relief.  I do not think the Government would  want\r\n\r\nto interpose itself and make a decision on their behalf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee has raised the question of property\r\n\r\ntax, in which he says\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit is manifestly unfair to remove the 25% property tax rebate\r\n\r\nand replace it with a 2% cut.  Arithmetically, he is correct.\r\n\r\nBut  the purpose is different.  As I have said in the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate,  the 25% tax rebate was introduced to help  companies\r\n\r\nduring a recession period.  That is largely over, and we  are\r\n\r\nnow  cutting taxes permanently, as I said, by 2%, which gives\r\n\r\ncompanies  certainty so that they can manage their  financial\r\n\r\naffairs for the future.  He also says that since property tax\r\n\r\nis  a  wealth  tax,  which has an impact on  business  costs,\r\n\r\nwhether they should not be reduced over time and, eventually,\r\n\r\nremoved.  We have already started to reduce it.  But  I  have\r\n\r\nalso  said  that  it is not a tax we will remove  altogether,\r\n\r\nbecause the total tax we collect is a substantial amount, and\r\n\r\ntotal  removal  would  mean that  the  tax  lost  has  to  be\r\n\r\nrecovered elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has raised issues on the question of\r\n\r\nstock  options and the incentives provided.  She is concerned\r\n\r\nthat the incentives provided for stock options may signal  to\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  stock  options  are  the  preferred  way  of\r\n\r\nremuneration.   I can assure her that is not  the  intention.\r\n\r\nThe  recent  measures to make the taxation of employee  stock\r\n\r\noptions  (ESOPs)  more  attractive  is  in  response  to  two\r\n\r\nemerging  trends.  One is the more widespread use of  equity-based  remuneration, and the actions of  other  countries  to\r\n\r\nmake  taxation  of  ESOPs  more  attractive.   As  talent  is\r\n\r\ninternationally mobile and is increasingly awarded  by  means\r\n\r\nof  stock  options, there is a need for our tax treatment  of\r\n\r\nESOPs  to  be  internationally attractive,  to  maintain  our\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the company stock options (CSOP) scheme,\r\n\r\none  important  objective  of  the  scheme  is  to  encourage\r\n\r\ncompanies to offer options to lower-ranked employees as well.\r\n\r\nAs options are a means of sharing the benefits of a company's\r\n\r\nsuccess with its employees, the scheme has been structured to\r\n\r\nencourage  options to be more widely distributed rather  than\r\n\r\nconfined  to  a select group of people at the top.   However,\r\n\r\nthe Government has no intention to suggest that stock options\r\n\r\nare superior to wages\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  bonuses paid out in cash.  In fact, the CSOP  scheme  is\r\n\r\nstructured  so that wages and bonuses paid out  in  cash  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to remain the primary means of employee remuneration.\r\n\r\nStock  options  should therefore be an additional  means  for\r\n\r\nmotivating and retaining employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it must be up to each company to decide\r\n\r\nwhether  it  wishes to participate in the scheme and  how  it\r\n\r\nwants  to  structure  its  scheme to satisfy  its  individual\r\n\r\nconditions  as well as to meet the needs of its company.   It\r\n\r\ncan  stay  with  the stock options just to  a  select  group,\r\n\r\nwithout  offering options to at least half its employees,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  case, the recipients of the options will simply  carry\r\n\r\non  with  their  benefits of the stock options,  without  the\r\n\r\nadditional tax break under the CSOP scheme.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee has also raised questions on the issue\r\n\r\non  the plight of pensioners. I understand his concern and  I\r\n\r\nam sympathetic, but as I have already addressed this issue in\r\n\r\nthe Budget round-up speech, I do not propose to go through it\r\n\r\nagain in detail.  But I would just like to point out that  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  the Singapore Allowance which has been  raised,\r\n\r\nalthough  not  by a very large amount, pensioners  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  given  ex-gratia  payments of quite  significant  sums,\r\n\r\ndepending  on the dates when they retired.  I can assure  him\r\n\r\nthat  the Singapore Allowance would be adjusted from time  to\r\n\r\ntime, depending on the impact of inflation and we would  look\r\n\r\nat it again whenever an increase is warranted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas has expressed concern over the\r\n\r\nseemingly  rapid  way  in  which cost  increases  are  passed\r\n\r\nthrough,  in the form of Government charges, so that whatever\r\n\r\nwe  give away, we are taking back in a different form.  I can\r\n\r\nassure him that this is not so.  I believe his concerns  were\r\n\r\nabout  the  recent increases in public utilities  rates,  but\r\n\r\nthis  was linked to changes in crude oil and fuel oil  prices\r\n\r\nwhich we cannot control.  I have explained\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  this  House last Wednesday, there has not been a  runaway\r\n\r\nincrease in living costs.  The CPI has only increased by 1.7%\r\n\r\nper  annum  over the past 10 years and this is  substantially\r\n\r\nlower than the average increase in incomes.  On balance, most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would be better off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Government fees and charges are concerned,\r\n\r\nthey  are increased to recover actual costs increase  and  no\r\n\r\nmore,  and  the increases are dependent on increases  in  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  wages.  We should not subsidise the labour cost  of\r\n\r\nservices,  and  we  generally try to  reduce  its  impact  by\r\n\r\nimprovements in productivity.  Where increases are necessary,\r\n\r\nin  essential  services  such as  healthcare,  education  and\r\n\r\npublic  housing,  the  increases are due  primarily  to  wage\r\n\r\nincreases  and  to  improvements in the  quality  of  service\r\n\r\nprovided.  Nevertheless, in all these cases, whether it is in\r\n\r\npublic  housing,  education  or  healthcare,  its  costs  are\r\n\r\nheavily  subsidised by the Government.   I  think  Mr  Thomas\r\n\r\nknows  that the health subsidies are substantial and I  would\r\n\r\nnot repeat it again since I have already mentioned it before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most of the issues raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in this year's\r\n\r\nbudget,  the Net Investment Income (NII) in Table  1  of  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Book  has  been moved up to be included  as  part  of\r\n\r\noperating  revenue.  The Minister for Finance  has  explained\r\n\r\nthe  reason in his Budget speech.  I note that in FY1999, NII\r\n\r\nwas estimated at $3.74 billion, and the revised FY1999 figure\r\n\r\nwas  $5.56  billion.  In FY2000, the estimated NII was  $5.61\r\n\r\nbillion.   In  this  year's budget, the  revised  FY2000  NII\r\n\r\nfigure  was $1.55 billion.  I would like to know what is  the\r\n\r\noriginal  revised NII figure for FY2000, before applying  the\r\n\r\nnew  method  of  calculation for contribution  to  Government\r\n\r\noperating  revenues.   The  estimated  NII  contribution  for\r\n\r\nFY2001  was  also lowered to $856 million.  May  I  know  the\r\n\r\nreason for the significantly lower estimate?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these years in Parliament, I find that the most\r\n\r\ndifficult to track the Government's performance is Government\r\n\r\ninvestments.  When I try to look for investment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincome  details,  either from the budget  summary  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance, or total estimated receipts, the  figure\r\n\r\ncan never tally with the total estimated figure.  I have also\r\n\r\nchecked the budget control documents.  I have also found that\r\n\r\nit  does  not  contain information on Government investments.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  are  supposed to focus  on  expenditure  during\r\n\r\nBudget  time, with Singapore's unique circumstances, I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  also  important that we should  know  how  Government\r\n\r\ninvests our money and how these investments perform over  the\r\n\r\nyears.  Moreover, since the Government emphasises so much  on\r\n\r\nthe  importance of financial reserves, it is only  fair  that\r\n\r\nthe  public  should have a clearer picture of the  investment\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we always talk that the Government is transparent,\r\n\r\nbut  the  investments of the Government do  not  seem  to  be\r\n\r\ntransparent to me. I therefore urge the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nto  release more details on how the Net Investment Income  is\r\n\r\nderived.   I  hope  that  in next year's  Budget  book,  more\r\n\r\ndetails of investment incomes would be shown.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, it cannot be denied that the\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked  companies  (GLCs)  have  been  a  positive\r\n\r\ninfluential factor on the economic development of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMany  GLCs  were formed in the early 1960s when there  was  a\r\n\r\nlack    of    private   sector   initiatives   to   spearhead\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  and  the Government  wanted  to  spur  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  certain  new sectors, such as banking,  shipping,\r\n\r\nship repair and the defence industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background, impact and public perception of GLCs is\r\n\r\nwell-covered in a recent article written by a journalist,  Mr\r\n\r\nYap  Chuin  Wei and published in the 3rd March issue  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times.   I  agree  with Mr  Yap  that  the  constant\r\n\r\nrefrains  of local businessmen about GLCs are that \"they  are\r\n\r\ncrowding out the private sector; they are stream-rolling  the\r\n\r\ncompetition    and    that   they   are   stifling    private\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.\"  It is a well-researched  and  well-argued\r\n\r\nanalysis  of  the  impact of the GLCs. I recommend  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister read this report.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local businessmen do not begrudge the existence of GLCs.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, everybody recognises the significant role the  GLCs\r\n\r\nhave played in our nation's progress.  The concerns over GLCs\r\n\r\nare three-fold:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The crowding out effect of the GLCs;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The complaint of unlevel playing field; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The stifling effect on private entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nActually  the  comments  about  GLCs  also  apply  to   other\r\n\r\nGovernment affiliated and union associated companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the crowding out effect of the GLCs, the Minister for\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry has clarified that the GLCs contributed to\r\n\r\nonly  13% of the economy.  Another report said that the  GLCs\r\n\r\nand  statutory boards collectively take up about 23%  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  In my opinion, even at 13% of the economy, the GLCs\r\n\r\nexert  a  much  larger influence over the market.   GLCs  are\r\n\r\nmanned  by current and past top civil servants, both  at  the\r\n\r\nboard and management levels.  By the fact that GLCs are owned\r\n\r\nand  linked  to  the  authorities, at both  shareholding  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  levels, they do exert a substantial influence  in\r\n\r\nthe market, beyond the numerical percentage of their share of\r\n\r\nthe  economy.  The main disadvantage of the crowding  out  by\r\n\r\nthe GLCs is that open market forces may not operate fully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were to read the annual report of Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings, we cannot help but to have the impression  that  we\r\n\r\nare  reading  the general economic survey of Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nGLCs,  and  the  Government affiliated and  union  associated\r\n\r\norganisations are practically involved in every aspect of the\r\n\r\neconomy.  In fact, we cannot get by a day without having some\r\n\r\ndealings with the GLCs.  For example, when we go to the bank,\r\n\r\nread the newspaper, buy food, use the telephone, or even take\r\n\r\na  bus,  taxi  or MRT, the GLC is there.  In fact,  GLCs  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in everything that we do.  We cannot throw  a  stone\r\n\r\nwithout hitting a GLC.  Are they not crowding out the private\r\n\r\nsector?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unlevel playing field is the second constant refrain\r\n\r\nof the private sector.  To be fair, I do not believe that the\r\n\r\nGLCs  will  get special deals, privileged advance information\r\n\r\nof Government policies or changes in plans, or even have easy\r\n\r\naccess  to  Government  funds.  Every  request  for  fund  is\r\n\r\nproperly  and  thoroughly  evaluated  before  the  money   is\r\n\r\ncommitted.   But what is true is that the top civil  servants\r\n\r\nwho  are  directors and managers of GLCs  do  have  a  better\r\n\r\nappreciation of Government policy thinking and trends.   They\r\n\r\nalso  have  close contacts, connections and access  to  their\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in  the Government regulatory agencies.   These\r\n\r\nare in fact strong advantages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I like to contend that the unlevel playing field\r\n\r\nof GLCs is more often perceived than real.  But even if it is\r\n\r\nperceived,  it  does  have a significant impact  on  business\r\n\r\ndealings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On stifling private entrepreneurship, I feel this is an\r\n\r\narea  of  real  concern. The concern  is  that  because  GLCs\r\n\r\ncommand  such  a large segment of the economy and  influence,\r\n\r\nthey  therefore capture an unduly large pool of the  business\r\n\r\nand   talent,   thereby  stifling  private  entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nPrivate  companies are affected as they have a smaller  share\r\n\r\nof the pie, and they find difficulty in attracting talents to\r\n\r\njoin  them.   In  contrast to GLCs, the impression  of  staff\r\n\r\njoining GLCs is that they offer better perks and sinecure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a concern that is worthwhile studying\r\n\r\nmore in depth. We want to build a strong private sector as an\r\n\r\nengine  of growth.  We also constantly lament on the lack  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to clarify that I voice the above concerns\r\n\r\nnot  because I am against GLCs per se.  I think they play and\r\n\r\nwill  continue to play a very important role in  the  nation-building  process.  I have many friends who  are  working  in\r\n\r\nGLCs and have close business dealings with GLCs.  In fact,  I\r\n\r\nhave  worked  in  a GLC before and served on boards  of  GLCs\r\n\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the Department of Statistics is doing\r\n\r\na  study  on GLCs and the Government has announced  that  its\r\n\r\ndivestment strategy of GLCs will continue.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  the status and the current plans.  Besides raising this\r\n\r\nissue in the Committee of Supply debate, I also have filed  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Question  to  seek  more  clarity   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Singapore context, I believe the GLCs are here to\r\n\r\nstay,  even in varying degrees in future.  Hence, I  strongly\r\n\r\nfeel  that it is not realistic to continue to adopt  a  self-denial  approach  that  the GLCs have no  impact  on  private\r\n\r\nenterprise.  I would propose that a detailed study or  review\r\n\r\nbe  done  by  a special committee, with representatives  from\r\n\r\nboth  the  public  and private sectors  to  examine  how  the\r\n\r\npositive  effects of GLCs can be further developed,  and  how\r\n\r\nthe  negative  effects can be mitigated.  The private  sector\r\n\r\nand   GLCs  can  work  together  for  their  mutual  benefit,\r\n\r\nespecially   in   going   regional   and   seeking   business\r\n\r\nopportunities around the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs have played an important role during the\r\n\r\nformative days of Singapore's economic development.  After 36\r\n\r\nyears  since  independence, it is time to do an appraisal  to\r\n\r\nreprise the roles of the GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, for the reasons that Mr Leong\r\n\r\nHorn  Kee just mentioned about the role of GLCs, I would like\r\n\r\nto  bring up a few issues and suggestions on how we can  make\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked  companies  more  effective  and  how  they\r\n\r\nshould  be managed for them to be more successful in the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.   And I too feel that GLCs do have a role  to  play,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  about time that we reviewed the regulations  and\r\n\r\nroles  and the responsibilities that the Government and  GLCs\r\n\r\nhave  with respect to how they should be managed as  we  move\r\n\r\nforward in the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the speed of privatisation needs to be\r\n\r\npicked  up  because  now is a good time  for  Singapore-based\r\n\r\ncompanies to get ahead in the global marketplace.  Due to the\r\n\r\neconomic uncertainty\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naround the world, there are and will be many viable companies\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be in distress and which would be  in  need  for\r\n\r\nstrong  partners  who  can bring financial  strength  through\r\n\r\nacquisitions  or  mergers.  I feel that it is  only  when  we\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  privatise our GLCs, can they  effectively  move\r\n\r\nfast  enough to capitalise on such opportunities  and  expand\r\n\r\nglobally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a need for greater transparency on\r\n\r\nhow  GLCs are managed, a point brought up by many Members and\r\n\r\nespecially for those that are not listed on the stock market.\r\n\r\nSome  of the things that need to be monitored are the funding\r\n\r\nand   fund-raising   from   Government   coffers,   corporate\r\n\r\nGovernment issues and related party transactions among  GLCs,\r\n\r\nwhere  GLCs  are given preference to each other in conducting\r\n\r\nbusiness, even when there are, and maybe better and more cost-effective    solutions   provided   by   private   companies.\r\n\r\nTransparency  will not only make them stronger as  this  will\r\n\r\nsubject  them to more stringent scrutiny than private  sector\r\n\r\ncompanies are subjected to.  I suggest that we put in place a\r\n\r\nwatchdog  body  which has a mix of private and public  sector\r\n\r\npeople and this body should have the responsibility to review\r\n\r\nand regulate how GLCs operate and are managed. I believe this\r\n\r\nis  being  done in some countries like in Hong Kong  and  New\r\n\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government should set a time-frame for each\r\n\r\ncurrent and future GLCs to be fully privatised and this  plan\r\n\r\nshould  be publicised so that all Singaporeans will be  aware\r\n\r\nof the privatisation schedules.  We should make out a list of\r\n\r\nsuch  companies  and invite private sector  investments  from\r\n\r\naround  the  world,  not  just from Singapore,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can divest as much of its holdings in the GLCs  as\r\n\r\nit  possibly can.  It is about time we monitored the progress\r\n\r\nof  our  privatisation plans.  We have heard of plans but  we\r\n\r\njust do not know the schedules, and therefore, cannot measure\r\n\r\nthe success rate of privatisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that we shut down non-viable GLCs by\r\n\r\nidentifying them early in the process.  If we do not do this,\r\n\r\nwe   will   continue  to  pour  public  funds  into  wasteful\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we have seen many examples of GLCs getting\r\n\r\ninto  businesses  they have no experiences in  running.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  Singapore Bus Service got  into  the  property\r\n\r\nbusiness and got its fingers burnt by losing quite a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney,  and  another GLC getting into the  food  business  by\r\n\r\nbuying  the fast food chain, Delifrance, which made no  sense\r\n\r\nfor the GLC's long-term growth strategy.  There are many more\r\n\r\nexamples  of  failed  investments by  GLCs,  which  got  into\r\n\r\nbusinesses  they had no expertise or experience in  managing.\r\n\r\nWe  should  therefore put in place strict rules,  disallowing\r\n\r\nGLCs  to  venture into non-core-competency activities.   This\r\n\r\nwill  also  avoid such GLCs from crowding out our  home-grown\r\n\r\nprivate sector companies,  a point which Mr Leong brought  up\r\n\r\nearlier on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, there should be greater involvement of private\r\n\r\nsector individuals in the boards and key management positions\r\n\r\nof  GLCs, for the same reasons that Mr Leong brought up.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  possibly expect civil servants, who may not have  had\r\n\r\nany business exposure in the past, to effectively manage such\r\n\r\ncompanies,  which  have  to operate   based  on  true  market\r\n\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, we should set the tone of privatisation and we\r\n\r\nshould   therefore  plan  to  outsource  the  governance   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in areas that make sense, by quickly  breaking  up\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards and Government agencies, and  spinning  off\r\n\r\nnon-core  and non-sensitive Government activities.   Can  the\r\n\r\nGovernment set a target of resource reduction, eg,  reduction\r\n\r\nby a certain number of Government employees or a reduction of\r\n\r\na  certain  percentage  of  Government  expenditure?    These\r\n\r\ntargets will help drive the pace of changes that we should be\r\n\r\nsetting for ourselves.  We will also ensure that more  people\r\n\r\nwill  be released to the private sector,  which is constantly\r\n\r\nfacing a severe shortage of manpower and talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, for Government-linked companies that are\r\n\r\nalready  listed,  will the Government consider  reducing  its\r\n\r\nstake to become a minority stakeholder?  In most\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncases,  the  Government still holds a majority  stake.   This\r\n\r\nwill  allow  true  private sector type  governance  for  such\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  hence, it will further help  build  up  their\r\n\r\nstrengths.   I  have heard of instances where companies  from\r\n\r\ndeveloped  nations  prefer  not to  deal  with  some  of  our\r\n\r\nprivatised  GLCs,  simply because such  companies  are  still\r\n\r\nviewed as being Government owned or Government controlled, by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  the  huge  majority  shareholding  held  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment through the investment arms, like Temasek Holdings\r\n\r\nand GIC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we also saw a few failed attempts by both SIA\r\n\r\nand SingTel when they tried to acquire significant stakes  in\r\n\r\nforeign companies, precisely because both are still viewed as\r\n\r\nGovernment  linked and Government controlled  companies,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  negative  reactions from the companies  that  were\r\n\r\nbeing  acquired.   Can the Minister share with  us  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  feels  about reducing their  stakes  in  GLCs  to\r\n\r\nbecome minority shareholders?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zulkifli, can you make your speech\r\n\r\nshort?  Otherwise, you will not get a reply at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, we have heard in this\r\n\r\nHouse  how GLCs are being viewed by SMEs as very big, strong,\r\n\r\nbut can be more friendly, because they leave very little room\r\n\r\nfor  others  to  do business and somehow enjoy  some  special\r\n\r\nposition  in  securing contracts and Government business.   I\r\n\r\nthink the Minister for Trade and Industry has clarified  this\r\n\r\nmatter.   My own view is that SMEs feel like this about  GLCs\r\n\r\nbecause they somehow feel uninvolved, uninvited, to take part\r\n\r\nin  the  larger process of privatisation, as GLCs  go  on  to\r\n\r\nexpand  their  business  or  take  part  in  some  very   big\r\n\r\nprojects, which is very important to make SMEs feel  a  sense\r\n\r\nof ownership, a sense of belonging.  They must be the ones to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the expansion of the airports and all that.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  sense of being uninvolved, unattached, uninvited,\r\n\r\nunappreciated must somehow be changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should the SMEs not, on the other hand, feel that\r\n\r\nGLCs  are  some of the most admired companies,  someone  that\r\n\r\nthey can become partners with, can do business with, as vital\r\n\r\norganisations  that  they  can link  up  with,  as  strategic\r\n\r\npartners, who can bring them forward as they expand into  the\r\n\r\nregion.  I think we should do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes wonder, as an illustration, Phua Chu Kang\r\n\r\nPrivate  Limited  may be number one in Singapore,  Johor  and\r\n\r\nBatam,  but  if  the  GLCs were to go  into  home  renovation\r\n\r\nbusiness,  whether they would be interested in the  likes  of\r\n\r\nPhua  Chua  Kang.   Because they are seen  to  be  completely\r\n\r\ndifferent types of people, irrelevant, and incompatible.  But\r\n\r\non  the  one hand, I think we see that some of the  SMEs  are\r\n\r\nvery  entrepreneurial.  They have close relationships in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   They  can  help GLCs negotiate the  very  difficult\r\n\r\nbusiness practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am asking the Minister really in privatising some\r\n\r\nof  these GLCs, for the GLCs to take on a role where they can\r\n\r\nlead,  bring along other SMEs together with them, not just  a\r\n\r\ncorporate or business mission, but other objectives as  well,\r\n\r\nthe larger objective of bringing along the SMEs as they grow,\r\n\r\nprosper and develop in the region.  The GLCs must then take a\r\n\r\nbig  brother  role  and  assist the SMEs.   Only  then  their\r\n\r\nfeelings about SMEs and GLCs can be improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, first, on Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang's question.  I will give him the figures that he  asks\r\n\r\nfor.   He also said the NII figure for the year 2000 was very\r\n\r\nhigh.   This  is because in that year there was a very  large\r\n\r\npayment from Temasek Holdings which will not be repeated this\r\n\r\nyear.  This accounts for the big difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the published figure for NII in FY2001 is low\r\n\r\nbecause it only includes 10% of the NII which is available to\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  use.  If you recall, the  amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  provides for up to 50%, but we only  notionally\r\n\r\ninclude a figure as 10%.  It is not that we are going to  use\r\n\r\nthe 10%.  But rather than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nput  a  zero  there, we have put 10%.  That is why  it  looks\r\n\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Government's return on investment is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  Government's investments are divided  into  three\r\n\r\ngroups.  One comes under Temasek Holdings, which is a holding\r\n\r\ncompany   for  GLCs,  and  its  accounts  are  available   to\r\n\r\nParliament.   The  other  is  MAS  which  manages   quite   a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  proportion of Government reserves.   Again,  the\r\n\r\nresults  are  published annually.  So you can  look  at  MAS'\r\n\r\nannual  reports to see how they are doing.  The final amount,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  large part of our reserves, is managed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Investment Corporation (GIC).   This  is  not  an\r\n\r\nasset  owning  company.   It  is  simply  a  fund  management\r\n\r\ncompany,  which  manages the remaining amount  of  Government\r\n\r\nreserves.   This  company does not publish its  results.   We\r\n\r\nhave explained why we do not publish the results because they\r\n\r\ncontain information which our competitors would love to have.\r\n\r\nBut  its accounts are available to the President and  to  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GIC is a very large fund manager and its performance is\r\n\r\ncomparable to the performance of any large international fund\r\n\r\nmanagement company, which manages a portfolio of funds spread\r\n\r\naround  the world, in a variety of assets and currencies.   I\r\n\r\ncan  assure Mr Low that the returns of the GIC are more  than\r\n\r\nadequate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, the reserves figures will not be in the\r\n\r\nBudget book, for the reasons I have explained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the problem of GLCs, the complaints are not\r\n\r\nnew.   We have given the same answer many times and I do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to go through it again.  I think the problem is one  of\r\n\r\nperception.   GLCs are generally large, and  they  are  large\r\n\r\nbecause  they were started by Government at the time  of  our\r\n\r\nindependence,  when there was a shortage  of  private  sector\r\n\r\nfunds, technical know-how and so forth.  They have now become\r\n\r\nquite  successful and large, and they are large  compared  to\r\n\r\nSMEs.  If it is a problem of size, would you prefer that GLCs\r\n\r\ndid  not  exist at all and have foreign companies  doing  the\r\n\r\nsame\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njob?   That will be far worse, I would assume.  So our  GLCs,\r\n\r\nwhich  compete in various sectors, must be strong enough  and\r\n\r\nas  efficient as the foreign companies who are free  to  come\r\n\r\nin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you an example. One of the corporations,\r\n\r\nNTUC  FairPrice  has  always been the  target  of  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncomplaints,  because it is seen to be competing  against  the\r\n\r\nmama  and  papa shops in HDB housing estates.  It has  become\r\n\r\nvery efficient and its prices are competitive and, generally,\r\n\r\nlow.  It has to compete against a supermarket chain like Cold\r\n\r\nStorage,  which is owned by a Hong Kong company,  Dairyfarms,\r\n\r\nwho  runs  a  very  large chain of supermarkets.   Would  you\r\n\r\nrather  that  NTUC  FairPrice  get  out  of  the  supermarket\r\n\r\nbusiness and let our SMEs compete directly with Cold Storage?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli is quite right that our objective should be\r\n\r\nto  get  our  successful GLCs to act as a mother hen,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  and  try  and help our SMEs to develop,  particularly\r\n\r\noverseas.  And  this,  in fact, is the objective  of  Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings,  which  is  the  holding  company  responsible  for\r\n\r\nmonitoring the performance of our GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, some of our GLCs have made wrong\r\n\r\ninvestments, as pointed out by Mr Inderjit Singh.  They  have\r\n\r\nmade  mistakes  and they have taken their punishment,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak.  But mistakes are bound to happen, hopefully, not very\r\n\r\nfrequently.  But because what has happened, Temasek  Holdings\r\n\r\nis  now imposing quite a strict policy to ensure that GLCs do\r\n\r\nnot  go  into  areas  outside their core competencies.   They\r\n\r\nshould  focus on expanding overseas and bring our SMEs along.\r\n\r\nWhat  is past, I think we will have to accept.  But from  now\r\n\r\non,  we recognise that the purpose of our GLCs is not to kill\r\n\r\nour  small SMEs, but to help them, and to compete against the\r\n\r\nbig  foreign  companies which, whether you like  it  or  not,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the open style of our economy, will want to  come\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Temasek Holdings is already doing quite a good\r\n\r\njob.   So  I  do  not think we would want to set  up  another\r\n\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsector  body to monitor the performance of GLCs.  Let Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings  do its job.  We will review the position from  time\r\n\r\nto  time.   And  if  we have problems of SMEs  facing  unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition, let us know and we will do everything we can  to\r\n\r\nensure that SMEs are not disadvantaged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you that the GLCs do not receive special\r\n\r\npreferences  from  Government.  They  operate  as  commercial\r\n\r\nentities  and  you can see that quite a few have  been  quite\r\n\r\nsuccessful.   Companies like SIA, DBS, PSA are top  companies\r\n\r\nin  their fields, and they are commercial companies we should\r\n\r\nbe proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the questions\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I just want to say that the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act  needs to be reformed to  better  protect  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  workers and small-time investors.   Small-time\r\n\r\ninvestors  are  also basically workers who  have  been  using\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF accounts to invest in the stock market.  And going\r\n\r\nby reports, they have not done well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that needs to be looked at is the\r\n\r\nrules  on  payments to workers of companies under liquidation\r\n\r\nand  judicial management.  Section 328 of the Act gives wages\r\n\r\nand  benefits, including retrenchment benefits,  preferential\r\n\r\ntreatment  in the event of liquidation.  However, when  there\r\n\r\nis  judicial management, workers are not preferred creditors.\r\n\r\nI  hope this will be addressed, together with the lifting  of\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  of five months' salary of $7,500, whichever  is\r\n\r\nlower.  This quantum was fixed in 1993.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter is that the small-time investors need\r\n\r\ninformation  to  make correct investment decisions.   So  the\r\n\r\nrules  on  disclosure, openness and transparency need  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed.   I accept that there are mindset obstacles  for  a\r\n\r\nprescriptive code on what should be disclosed.  I  know  that\r\n\r\neven  if there is a prescription, the companies will use this\r\n\r\nas a minimal standard, and stick to it.  So I see that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  is a role for the SIAS,  as a voice for the small-time\r\n\r\ninvestors,  in monitoring the market and helping  the  small-time  investors to make wise decisions.

Much has changed in terms  of  the  way  and\r\n\r\nscale  on which the Government now operates, especially  from\r\n\r\nthe  perspective of the extensive use of technology  and  the\r\n\r\nattendant risk to our economy at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In revisiting the Auditor-General's role, I would like\r\n\r\nto draw a parallel to the auditing function of a company, for\r\n\r\nwhich the Audit Committee is responsible and which is usually\r\n\r\naccomplished  by  both  the  Internal  Audit  Department  and\r\n\r\nexternal auditors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand, not all Ministries have internal audit\r\n\r\nfunctions.  If true, the Auditor-General would then  have  to\r\n\r\nundertake  both the internal and external roles.   This  will\r\n\r\nlead  to  a  situation where owing to the sheer  variety  and\r\n\r\nscale   of  operations,  the  audit  can  at  best  highlight\r\n\r\noccasional  lapses.  Moreover, there would  be  inevitably  a\r\n\r\npreoccupation  with the means rather than the end.   Ideally,\r\n\r\nthe  focus  should be more outcome-oriented than  process  or\r\n\r\ncompliance-driven.  To illustrate with an  extreme  case,  it\r\n\r\nwould be far better to highlight weaknesses in the sharing of\r\n\r\na sensitive financial database than to detect an over-payment\r\n\r\nof $200 to a staff who has resigned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the wide application of technology. Sir, the\r\n\r\nentire  Government  machinery is  so  wired  up  now  that  a\r\n\r\ncommensurate  amount of auditing resources must be  allocated\r\n\r\ntowards ensuring the preservation of integrity.  The auditing\r\n\r\nfunction  must  take  cognisance of the  risk,  financial  or\r\n\r\notherwise,  of losing access to, or abuse of, the information\r\n\r\nwithin the various Government networks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is even a strong case to argue for a\r\n\r\nshift  towards a more proactive than a purely reactive stance\r\n\r\nin  the  longer  term.  I would therefore  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  how  he thinks the role of the Auditor-General  can\r\n\r\nstay relevant to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincreasing  use of technology and whether amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nAudit  Act  are  necessary  to  shift  the  focus  towards  a\r\n\r\nminimisation of risk than financial compliance per se.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the role of the Auditor-General is separate from the Internal Auditor. Currently,\r\n\r\nabout  half  of  the  Ministries have internal  audit  units.\r\n\r\nSince  October last year, the Accountant General's Department\r\n\r\nhas  been encouraging all Ministries to set up internal audit\r\n\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audits by Auditor-General's Office focus on both the\r\n\r\nprocess  as well as the outcome.  However, the Audit  Report,\r\n\r\nwhich is submitted to the President who in turn tables it  in\r\n\r\nParliament, tends to focus on the outcome, to demonstrate the\r\n\r\neffect of some of the control weaknesses.  Control weaknesses\r\n\r\nand recommendations are reported separately to the Ministries\r\n\r\nin  management  letters that are sent out  after  each  audit\r\n\r\nproject.   In  FY1999/2000  audit,  more  than  700   control\r\n\r\nweaknesses were reported to Ministries for improvement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to auditing the highly wired up Government\r\n\r\nenvironment, there have not been impediments to the  Auditor-General's ability to audit and take into account the risk  of\r\n\r\nlosing  access  to  or  abuse  of information  of  Government\r\n\r\nnetworks.  Hence, there are no plans to amend the Audit  Act.\r\n\r\nTo  deal  with the increasing use of technology, the Auditor-General's  Office has stepped up training of its auditors  in\r\n\r\ncomputer-assisted audit techniques.  It has also equipped its\r\n\r\nauditors with notebook computers with sufficient capacity  to\r\n\r\nexamine and carry out tests on financial data downloaded from\r\n\r\nits auditees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nresponse and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $16,094,540 for Head C ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $305,600 for Head C ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Z -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head Z - Financial Transfers.

I find no problem with  the\r\n\r\nallocation  to 3-roomers, even though some of you  may  point\r\n\r\nout  that some 3-roomers may actually own big cars.  However,\r\n\r\nI  do  think  that  perhaps a little room for  adjusting  the\r\n\r\ngeneral rule can be thought about, particularly in this issue\r\n\r\nof dependants of low-income earners, who live in the quarters\r\n\r\nof  their  employers or in institutional quarters.   I  think\r\n\r\nthese  are,  quite clearly, people deserving of  help  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask that the Minister amend the general rule  so  that\r\n\r\nthis  can  be  taken note of.  It may be necessary  for  such\r\n\r\npeople to come forward and identify themselves.  But I  think\r\n\r\nthere  would not be too many people and therefore  this  rule\r\n\r\ncould be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I agree with Prof. Toh's\r\n\r\nconcern.

I will look at this problem in detail  and  see\r\n\r\nwhat  we  can do perhaps next time round, because I recognise\r\n\r\nthat there is some unfairness.  Although there is a provision\r\n\r\nwhere  they can go to their CCCs or the CDCs to ask for help,\r\n\r\nthey  may feel reluctant to do so.

We have to maximise\r\n\r\nour  manpower  resources in order to carve  a  niche  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal  competition.  We have to ensure that our people  have\r\n\r\nenough  jobs,  better  quality jobs in future,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsustain  high quality of life in Singapore.  But  competition\r\n\r\nis  always  going  to  get keener as new  entrants  into  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  world  offer  cheaper manpower,  land  and  other\r\n\r\nresource cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to stay ahead of our competition\r\n\r\nbecause  our  manpower remains disciplined and  well-trained.\r\n\r\nBut we have to watch our competitors.  Even as we improve our\r\n\r\npre-employment education training, other countries, like  the\r\n\r\nUS  and  the  UK,  have also come up in  recent  years,  with\r\n\r\ninitiatives  to improve the quality of their  workforce.   We\r\n\r\nare  competing not only with fellow developing countries  but\r\n\r\nalso  with  more  developed countries as our economy  becomes\r\n\r\nmore mature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example, Sir, in the United States, a\r\n\r\nWorkforce  Investment  Act was enacted  in  1998  to  provide\r\n\r\ngreater   support  for  workforce  development  and   special\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  were  set  up  to  implement  five  years'\r\n\r\nstrategic  plans for workforce development.  In the  UK,  the\r\n\r\nBritish government launched a new National  Skills Agenda.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this was done last year.  Its primary objective is  to\r\n\r\nboost workforce skills to support industrial development and,\r\n\r\nmore importantly,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  sustain the country's international competitiveness.   So\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  watch our competitors as we try to improve  the\r\n\r\nquality of our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support new investments and jobs so that we can\r\n\r\nsustain long-term economic development for Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  10  to  15  years, we need a workforce with  65%  post-secondary education.  I think we are on the way towards that.\r\n\r\nBut  at  the same time, half a million of our workers do  not\r\n\r\nhave  secondary qualification.  We have set up  the  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning  Endowment Fund to ensure that our workers  will  be\r\n\r\nable to take up skills training courses to improve themselves\r\n\r\nin order to remain relevant.  However, we are a long way from\r\n\r\nthe target of helping so many workers to be retrained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Manpower Minister for an update\r\n\r\non  the implementation of Manpower 21, in particular how  the\r\n\r\nsix   strategies  have  been  implemented  since  we  started\r\n\r\nManpower  21.  For example, for integrated manpower  planning\r\n\r\naspect of the Manpower 21, how do we plan for manpower  needs\r\n\r\nof  certain industries when technology changes so  fast?   Is\r\n\r\nour manpower planning cycle able to catch up with the changes\r\n\r\nin technology?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On lifelong learning and lifelong employability, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister to give us some progress  on  the\r\n\r\nretraining  programmes under SRP and other  training  in  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes, and how we are going to cover training programmes\r\n\r\nfor  half  a  million  workers  who  do  not  have  secondary\r\n\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, on augmentation of our talent pool. As we\r\n\r\nneed  foreign workers and foreign talent, what is the optimal\r\n\r\nproportion of foreign workers and foreign talent that we  can\r\n\r\nhost  in  Singapore in the context of the needs  of  our  own\r\n\r\nlocal workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower is classified under the Economic Development  Sector\r\n\r\nin the Government budget.  MOM has a total expenditure budget\r\n\r\nof $184.15 million.  This comprises the operating\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpenditure   budget  of  $121.85  million  and   development\r\n\r\nexpenditure   budget   of   $62.3  million.    MOM's   budget\r\n\r\nconstitutes  only  0.66%,  two-thirds  of  1%  of  the  total\r\n\r\nGovernment budget.  It has the lowest budget provision  among\r\n\r\nall  the  Government Ministries.  I certainly hope that  this\r\n\r\nlow   budget  provision  does  not  reflect  the  value   and\r\n\r\nimportance  that  the Government has on the  only  asset  and\r\n\r\nresource we have in Singapore, that is, our people.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very impressed with the latest Annual Report,\r\n\r\ncalled the Millennium Report, of the Ministry of Manpower for\r\n\r\nthe  year 1999/2000.  I only wish that more Singaporeans have\r\n\r\naccess  and read the wealth of information contained  in  the\r\n\r\nMillennium Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans need to know the challenges we face in the\r\n\r\nNew   Economy.   Very  different  skills,  competencies   and\r\n\r\ncapabilities  will  be  required  in  working  in   the   new\r\n\r\ncommercial  and business environment.  To remain  employable,\r\n\r\nworkers will have to be knowledgeable, skilful and adaptable.\r\n\r\nWith threats, there are also opportunities for us to reap the\r\n\r\nrewards in the New Economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out from the Minister how well\r\n\r\ninformed and prepared are Singaporeans for the pace of change\r\n\r\ntaking place in our economy.  Do Singaporeans have the  right\r\n\r\nattitude and mindset to cope with the change brought about by\r\n\r\nglobalisation, information and communication technology?   Do\r\n\r\nwe  have the necessary manpower of the right calibre to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of the new manufacturing and services sectors  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is necessary for us to address the needs of the\r\n\r\nolder  workers  who are less educated, having  little  or  no\r\n\r\nskills  in  our society.  The Ministry of Manpower  and  NTUC\r\n\r\nhave done a great deal for them.  However, we must not ignore\r\n\r\nthe  growing  number  of  executives  and  middle  management\r\n\r\npersonnel who have been displaced by mergers and acquisitions\r\n\r\nof companies, and business restructuring.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  been retrenched in recent  years  because\r\n\r\ntheir  companies have suffered losses or have been  relocated\r\n\r\nto  other countries in the region.  May I ask the Minister to\r\n\r\ngive  us his views on the employment outlook in the next  few\r\n\r\nyears and into the future, if possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM is in the enviable position for the abundant\r\n\r\nmanpower  data  and  information that it possesses.

It also knows by the issuance  of  employment\r\n\r\npasses  and  work  permits,  how  many  expatriate  managers,\r\n\r\nprofessionals  and foreign workers are working in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry can be more proactive in sharing the employment\r\n\r\ninformation  with  Singaporeans  because  they  are  in   the\r\n\r\nexcellent  position  to  provide  job-matching  services  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  needing jobs or Singaporeans  who  want  a  job\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the local level, the CDCs are good links and networks\r\n\r\nfor  MOM to tap.  They can be one-stop shop for companies and\r\n\r\nindividuals  looking for work to connect  with  one  another.\r\n\r\nMOM  can  facilitate  the process to  match  and  secure  the\r\n\r\nproductive  resources  and energies of  Singaporeans  through\r\n\r\ngainful employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry will actively look into providing\r\n\r\ntimely and good job information and job matching services for\r\n\r\nboth  the  companies and individuals.  With better employment\r\n\r\nmarket   information,  we  can  reduce  wastage  and   better\r\n\r\nutilisation of our limited manpower resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> On lifelong learning, Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  very  generous in  setting  up  the  $100,000\r\n\r\nmillion Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.  The NTUC and self-help   groups  are  also  providing  retraining  and   skills\r\n\r\nredevelopment opportunities for those who need assistance for\r\n\r\nupgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is in the area of general attitude and\r\n\r\nexpectations  of  employers  and individuals  towards  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.  There are attitudinal and practical barriers that\r\n\r\nneed  addressing.  Perhaps, the Minister can  share  with  us\r\n\r\nwhat incentives are in place to encourage as many individuals\r\n\r\nas possible to take lifelong learning seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly like the initiative that the Ministry has\r\n\r\ntaken  under  the  Strategic Manpower  Conversion  Programme.\r\n\r\nHere,  professionals  are channelled  into  strategic  growth\r\n\r\nareas   through   conversion   training.    The   Information\r\n\r\nCommunication  Technology sector was piloted.   It  has  been\r\n\r\nhighly  successful  in  helping  many  individuals  make  the\r\n\r\nswitch.   I  wonder  if there are other  areas  that  can  be\r\n\r\nincluded  in  the  programme.  I foresee  the  life  sciences\r\n\r\nsector  as  one key growth area where many more professionals\r\n\r\nwill  be  required in the future.  There may be other sectors\r\n\r\nin the pipeline.  Perhaps, the Minister can share with us the\r\n\r\nsteps  taken  by  his  Ministry to prepare  Singaporeans  for\r\n\r\nlifelong learning for lifelong employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the most valuable\r\n\r\nasset  of Singapore of course is our human resource.  Because\r\n\r\nthis  is  one  of  our key building blocks  in  ensuring  the\r\n\r\ncontinued competitiveness and survival of our economy.   This\r\n\r\nis  even more so now in the new Internet-driven economy which\r\n\r\nis  largely determined by the quality and brain power of  the\r\n\r\nhuman  resources.  Over the years, the Government has  poured\r\n\r\nin  substantial  amounts of public funds to  set  up  various\r\n\r\ntraining   and   retraining  schemes.   The  Government   has\r\n\r\nallocated   $200   million  for  the   Manpower   Development\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme  (MDAS),  $100  million  for  the   Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  (SDF), and another $200  million  for  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment Programme (SRP). Recently, the Minister\r\n\r\nannounced  that  another $500 million will be  added  to  the\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning Endowment Fund,  making  a  total  of   $1\r\n\r\nbillion.   This  Fund  is  set up to train  and  retrain  our\r\n\r\nworkers to upgrade their skills and knowledge.  We must  also\r\n\r\nnot  forget  the billions of dollars invested in  our  school\r\n\r\neducation system to ensure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat our new generation of workers are specially trained  and\r\n\r\npossess the relevant skills for the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting up of the various schemes is a move in\r\n\r\nthe  right  direction to upgrade the skills and knowledge  of\r\n\r\nour  workers.   However, I must point out that  SDF  and  SRP\r\n\r\nschemes are essentially employer-based.   In other words, the\r\n\r\ncourses that the workers would like to go to must be relevant\r\n\r\nto  their work only. Only  then will the employers be willing\r\n\r\nto  allow  them  to  go for training or retraining.    It  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  for  this reason that the NTUC  set  up  the  NTUC\r\n\r\nEducation and Training Fund (NETF), with the support  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  to  train union members on an individual  basis.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, the workers can apply to the NETF to finance\r\n\r\ntheir training on some courses which are not directly related\r\n\r\nto their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund is a laudable\r\n\r\nproject.   But the question is:  how will the scheme  operate\r\n\r\nand  how can workers benefit from such a scheme? I hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Manpower and the  relevant  agencies  will\r\n\r\nquickly   work   out   proper  guidelines,   incentives   and\r\n\r\noperational schemes so that our workers can tap into the fund\r\n\r\nfor  their skills upgrading purposes.  On this point, I  hope\r\n\r\nthat the scheme will be operated in different directions.  We\r\n\r\nshould   also  consider  allowing  every  eligible  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen to apply directly to this Lifelong Learning Endowment\r\n\r\nFund to pursue their skills upgrading courses.  While most of\r\n\r\nour  employers  are  generally  supportive  of  training  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  it is just not possible for our workers to  go  for\r\n\r\ntraining.   At the same time, there may be some  workers  who\r\n\r\nmay  want  to  attend  courses which,  in  the  view  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers,  are  not  directly relevant or  useful  to  their\r\n\r\nfuture  career  development.  As  we  move  towards  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy,  our  workers'  skills  and  knowledge  will  become\r\n\r\nobsolete  very fast and they are constantly put to test.   As\r\n\r\nsuch, the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund should be operated\r\n\r\nin  a flexible manner in order that it may enable our workers\r\n\r\nto be quickly trained and retrained.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, I also read the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower's  Millennium  Report  and  it  is  indeed  a   very\r\n\r\nimpressive report.  I particularly like the transformation of\r\n\r\nthe  idea of Singapore as a little red dot to Singapore as  a\r\n\r\nhot spot for talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report speaks of the rapid advances in technology\r\n\r\nand  intense global competition that will require our workers\r\n\r\nto  develop  new  skills throughout their  lives.   That  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is committed to encourage and assist our  workers\r\n\r\nto meet this challenge is clear, from the funding it has been\r\n\r\nwilling  to put to this cause.  For older and lesser educated\r\n\r\nworkers,  particularly, hundreds of millions of dollars  have\r\n\r\nbeen committed to the Skills Redevelopment Programme and  the\r\n\r\nManpower Development Assistance Scheme.  However, as  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen noted by speakers before, and also the Minister of State\r\n\r\nfor  Manpower,  in response to a Question in the  House  last\r\n\r\nyear,  our  biggest challenge now is not so much  in  finding\r\n\r\nfunds  for  upgrading,  but encouraging  both  employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers to come forward and utilise these incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, having made all that money available, have\r\n\r\nwe thoroughly investigated all the obstacles that are holding\r\n\r\npeople  back  from  accessing skills upgrading,  and  made  a\r\n\r\nconcerted  effort, including perhaps signing a small  portion\r\n\r\nof  the  fund  to find ways to overcome them?   A  couple  of\r\n\r\nroutes come specifically to mind.  Firstly, older workers for\r\n\r\nwhom we may have classified as plain poor attitude may indeed\r\n\r\nbe  real  psychological  barriers and  anxiety  and  who  may\r\n\r\nbenefit from better structured encouragement and counselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, workers who are holding down more than one job\r\n\r\nto make ends meet.  How can they be assisted to find the time\r\n\r\nor  get financial assistance to tide them through during  the\r\n\r\nduration  of  the course?  And finally, single  parents  with\r\n\r\nchild  minding  responsibilities, mainly women.   Can  simple\r\n\r\nbaby-sitting  arrangements, for  example,  at  the  place  of\r\n\r\ninstruction  be  made so that this group who would  otherwise\r\n\r\nnot be able to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattend, especially for courses held in the evenings, can  now\r\n\r\nhave  the  opportunity?   With all the  good  intentions  and\r\n\r\nefforts  that  have  gone into putting together  schemes  for\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading,  I  am sure some additional  attention  to\r\n\r\naddressing obstacles to the utilisation by target groups will\r\n\r\nbe well worth the effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst,   may  I  thank  all  the  Members  who  have  spoken,\r\n\r\nespecially  those  who  have  complimented  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower on its Millennium Report, or the Annual Report,  for\r\n\r\nthe last financial year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address the points raised, particularly,\r\n\r\nby  Mr  Hawazi  and also Mr Loh Meng See  in  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nprogress  that we are making in implementing the Manpower  21\r\n\r\nstrategies  and  in  getting Singaporeans  prepared  for  the\r\n\r\nchanges that are coming at a very rapid pace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last two years, we have certainly made\r\n\r\nsome  progress  in  regard to implementing  the  Manpower  21\r\n\r\nstrategies.   I  would like to highlight a  few  of  the  key\r\n\r\nareas.   We have established an integrated manpower  planning\r\n\r\nframework  to guide pre-employment training as  well  as  in-employment  training  under  the direction  of  the  National\r\n\r\nManpower  Council.  This Inter-Ministerial Council  seeks  to\r\n\r\nidentify   key  growth  areas  and  to  channel   appropriate\r\n\r\nresources  to meet manpower demands in these growth  sectors.\r\n\r\nIt  is not going to be an easy task and we may not be able to\r\n\r\nget it perfectly right all the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the process of manpower planning, we should be\r\n\r\nable  to better anticipate the rapid changes that are  taking\r\n\r\nplace  in  the  wake  of globalisation  and  also  develop  a\r\n\r\nworkforce with all the right mix of skills so that  they  can\r\n\r\nhelp  us  to enhance our competitiveness.  In our studies  of\r\n\r\nthe  manpower demand from the various sectors of the economy,\r\n\r\nit appears that, in the short term, manpower demand is likely\r\n\r\nto   come   from   industries  like  computers,   information\r\n\r\ntechnology, communications and media, financial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninter-mediation, and the chemical industry which  forms  part\r\n\r\nof  the  life sciences cluster.  In addition, manpower demand\r\n\r\nin the social, healthcare and education services will also be\r\n\r\nhigh in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we transit to the new economy, the demand for higher\r\n\r\nskill  workers  in  professional,  technical  and  managerial\r\n\r\npositions   will  increase,  particularly   in   the   growth\r\n\r\nindustries  in  the service and manufacturing sectors.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  phenomenon  is already evident.  As of September  2000,\r\n\r\nvacancies for professionals, managers and technical personnel\r\n\r\nform 35% of the total available job openings.  This is nearly\r\n\r\ntriple the 13% share that this group held in 1991.  There  is\r\n\r\nalso  an  increasing need for workers trained in  specialised\r\n\r\nand  technical fields like engineering and the sciences.   In\r\n\r\nthe  new  economy,  comparative advantages will  increasingly\r\n\r\nhinge  on innovations, development of new products,  and  the\r\n\r\nability  to  apply new technology as soon as  they  come  on-stream.   Hence, we need to have a strong base  of  engineers\r\n\r\nand  technically-trained manpower to provide the backbone for\r\n\r\nthe manufacturing and key service sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these industries and the employment\r\n\r\ntrend, the universities and polytechnics will increase  their\r\n\r\nintakes   for   disciplines   such   as   info-communication,\r\n\r\nengineering  and  the sciences, including life  sciences,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as education.  The ITE will also offer more places  for\r\n\r\nits technical courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new economy, manpower planning must go beyond a\r\n\r\nnumber-counting  exercise.   Besides  trying  to   anticipate\r\n\r\nchanges in manpower demand, we must provide more information,\r\n\r\nand more timely information, to employers and workers so that\r\n\r\nthey  can respond swiftly to the changes taking place.   This\r\n\r\nwas  a point raised by Mr Loh Meng See also, about how we are\r\n\r\nmaking information available to the workers.  Hence, we  have\r\n\r\nestablished an enhanced National Manpower Information System\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  provide  relevant manpower information to  policy-makers,\r\n\r\nemployers,  training providers and workers, to help  them  in\r\n\r\ndecision-making.  We have also made available many up-to-date\r\n\r\nlabour  market information and statistical releases, manpower\r\n\r\npublications,  and  the  results of various  surveys  in  the\r\n\r\nlabour  market.   For  instance, Sir, we  will  be  releasing\r\n\r\ninformation on employment trends and outlook for the  various\r\n\r\nindustries  by the end of March in print as well  as  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet.  In order to give it wider circulation, we will put\r\n\r\nmost  of  these reports on the Internet so that they  can  be\r\n\r\nconveniently  accessed by anybody with a  personal  computer.\r\n\r\nSir, our manpower planning framework is in place.  Of course,\r\n\r\nit  has to be refined and will be refined.  It will be tuned,\r\n\r\nwith  the benefit of experience.  Over time, it should enable\r\n\r\nus  to have a better qualitative and quantitative estimate of\r\n\r\nour manpower demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to life-long learning for life-long\r\n\r\nemployability.  This is one of the key strategies  under  the\r\n\r\nManpower  21 plan.  The Skills Redevelopment Programme  (SRP)\r\n\r\nis  a  major  initiative in life-long learning.  For  FY2000,\r\n\r\nabout 23,000 workers participated in the SRP, an increase  of\r\n\r\nabout  60% over the 14,000 in FY1999.  More than 90% of these\r\n\r\ntrainees have no more than secondary education.  They are the\r\n\r\nones   who   will  benefit  tremendously  from   the   Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme, which has succeeded to  raise  their\r\n\r\nskills level and enhance their employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey of SRP participants, jointly commissioned by my\r\n\r\nMinistry  and the NTUC, showed that about 60% of the trainees\r\n\r\nreported  an increase in their job scope after SRP  training.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, with SRP training, they were able to take on\r\n\r\nmore  responsibilities  at their place  of  work.   40%  also\r\n\r\nenjoyed  a  pay increase, 70% of the employers reported  that\r\n\r\ntheir  workers  were more productive after undergoing  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme training.  As for retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nwho  took  part  in the training programme, 75%  secured  re-employment within six months of completion of their  training\r\n\r\ncourses.  These are encouraging\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresults.  They show that training can make a difference.   We\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to work closely with NTUC to further  promote\r\n\r\nthe Skills Redevelopment Programme, and to convince even more\r\n\r\nemployers and workers to participate in the programme in  the\r\n\r\nyears ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, my Ministry, together with the\r\n\r\nProductivity and Standards Board, launched a National  Skills\r\n\r\nRecognition  System, which is also aimed  at  helping  lower-educated  workers.   It  will  provide  open  entry  training\r\n\r\ncourses  and  skills upgrading for workers.  The training  is\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  be job-specific and modular, with a  nationally\r\n\r\nrecognised skill certificate for each level achieved.  As the\r\n\r\nskills  would  have  to  be  relevant  to  actual  jobs,  the\r\n\r\ncommitment and participation of industry groups and employers\r\n\r\nare of utmost importance.  To date, 35 industries are already\r\n\r\nin   the   process   of  implementing  the  National   Skills\r\n\r\nRecognition  System.  Close  to  2,000  workers   have   been\r\n\r\nassessed.   In the coming year, we will develop  more  skills\r\n\r\nstandards  covering more industries in different sectors  and\r\n\r\nincrease  the number of workers who can be trained,  assessed\r\n\r\nand   certified.    The  National  Skills  Certificate   will\r\n\r\ncertainly help these workers to face the demands of  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, manpower development has also received an added\r\n\r\nboost  with the creation of the $5 billion Lifelong  Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund.   Already, the Government has  committed  $1\r\n\r\nbillion  to the endowment fund:  $500 million last year,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance, in his Budget  speech,  promised\r\n\r\nanother  $500  million  this year.  My  Ministry  is  working\r\n\r\nclosely  with  the Info-Communications Development  Authority\r\n\r\nand  other agencies to launch the first major programme under\r\n\r\nthe  Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund.   This  will  be  the\r\n\r\nNational Information Technology Literacy Programme which aims\r\n\r\nto  reach  out and train 350,000 people over the  next  three\r\n\r\nyears,  in  basic  computer skills and teach them  sufficient\r\n\r\ncomputer  skills  so  that they can surf  the  Internet,  for\r\n\r\ninstance.   It is a programme that will help all Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto bridge the digital divide, and level up the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlower-educated  and older Singaporeans to  the  new  economy.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  we have spent about $1 million in developing  the\r\n\r\ncourseware and to run a pilot project involving 5,000  people\r\n\r\nat several community clubs, Toa Payoh Community Library and a\r\n\r\nfew other locations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier on, information is important.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my Ministry has pioneered the establishment of the\r\n\r\nfirst  one-stop Career Centre in July last year.  The  Centre\r\n\r\nhelps  individuals  in their job search,  career  management,\r\n\r\nselection  of training courses, and training incentives.   It\r\n\r\nalso  helps  employers in their recruitment and  training  of\r\n\r\nworkers.   The  initial  results from  this  one-stop  Career\r\n\r\nCentre  have been encouraging.  20% of those who came to  the\r\n\r\nCentre for help in the first six months said that their visit\r\n\r\nhad helped them to secure a job.  Another 12% said that their\r\n\r\nvisit  had helped them to develop a better career plan.   10%\r\n\r\nwere  more  aware of the various training opportunities,  and\r\n\r\nanother 6% actually signed up for training courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it convenient for Singaporeans to access these\r\n\r\nservices, we will work with various partners, such  as  self-help groups and the Community Development Councils to provide\r\n\r\nsimilar   services  at  other  convenient  locations.    This\r\n\r\nreflects  the point that Mr Loh Meng See had made earlier  on\r\n\r\nabout the CDCs and other community groups playing their  role\r\n\r\nas  part of the network to reach out to Singaporeans to  come\r\n\r\nforward   to   take  advantage  of  our  life-long   learning\r\n\r\ninvestments.   We  will  continue  to  work  with  all  these\r\n\r\ncommunity  organisations so that we can  bring  our  services\r\n\r\ncloser  to  the  people.   We are also  working  to  put  our\r\n\r\nservices, in terms of career guidance, job matching, training\r\n\r\ninformation  over  the Internet for those who  are  Internet-savvy,  ie,  those  who  are already  capable  of  using  the\r\n\r\nInternet, both the employers and the individuals.  But,  more\r\n\r\nthan  that, I think community organisations that want to help\r\n\r\nus to reach out to the people can play a role here, by having\r\n\r\nsome of their service personnel trained to utilise our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservices  provided over the Internet, so that they  can  help\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  not Internet-enabled to have access  to  our\r\n\r\nInternet  services with computers that are  provided  at  the\r\n\r\nvarious centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next strategy of the Manpower 21 plan that I\r\n\r\nwant to touch on is the point about foreign talent, which  Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi mentioned.  Manpower 21 clearly recognises the need to\r\n\r\nsupplement  our  talent pool with foreign talent.   Over  the\r\n\r\nlast two years, we have embarked on a comprehensive revamp of\r\n\r\nour  work  pass framework.  We have de-linked the  work  pass\r\n\r\nframework  from  the immigration regulations, introduced  new\r\n\r\nschemes  which  can  facilitate and encourage  the  entry  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs into Singapore, coordinated the integration  of\r\n\r\ntalent  attraction activities across many economic  agencies,\r\n\r\nand   put   in   place  an  international  talent  attraction\r\n\r\nprocessing and settling-in service with an expanded chain  of\r\n\r\nContact Singapore offices around the world.  We have expanded\r\n\r\nthe  chain  from  seven offices in 1999 to 11 throughout  the\r\n\r\nworld.   In  the years ahead, we will continue to  strengthen\r\n\r\nour  links with Singaporeans living overseas, and also  raise\r\n\r\nawareness  among  global  talent  of  the  opportunities  and\r\n\r\nchallenges available in Singapore. We will join in the global\r\n\r\nwar for talent to seek our share of talent and to enhance our\r\n\r\ncapabilities in many different areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower 21 also recommended that we take steps to\r\n\r\ntransform   our  workplace  environment.   We  have   already\r\n\r\ninitiated measures and programmes to professionalise  certain\r\n\r\nsectors  by encouraging and supporting the efforts  of  these\r\n\r\ndomestic-based  industries,  to  transform  and  upgrade  the\r\n\r\nservices that they offer and the jobs that they can offer  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  The examples include the Construction 21  plan\r\n\r\nto  reinvent  the  construction industry, the  initiative  to\r\n\r\nprofessionalise  the commercial cleaning industry,  steps  to\r\n\r\nenhance  service  standards  and productivity  in  the  hotel\r\n\r\nindustry  and, most recently, the Productivity and  Standards\r\n\r\nBoard's  announcement of the Retail 21 plan  to  upgrade  and\r\n\r\ntransform the retail industry.  These efforts\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecognise the critical need to professionalise the  jobs  and\r\n\r\ntransform the workplace environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also utilising funds provided under the\r\n\r\nManpower Development Assistance Scheme to set up new training\r\n\r\nfacilities for workers in industries which are moving  ahead,\r\n\r\nto  improve  their  business model and redesign  their  jobs.\r\n\r\nSuch   investments  and  support  for  the  private  sector's\r\n\r\ninitiative  will  certainly play a part in  transforming  the\r\n\r\nworkplace   environment,  and  create  more  attractive   and\r\n\r\nrewarding job opportunities for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing Manpower 21, my Ministry has also worked\r\n\r\nclosely  with  the  public, private and the  people  sectors.\r\n\r\nOver  the  past  year,  for  instance,  we  implemented   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Learning  Initiative.   We  held  the   inaugural\r\n\r\nSingapore  Learning Festival 2000, which is the anchor  event\r\n\r\nto  promote life-long learning.  This event was held over two\r\n\r\nweeks,  from  August  to September last year.   The  festival\r\n\r\ngenerated  over  300  learning activities  by  65  partnering\r\n\r\norganisations.   Nearly 150,000 people  participated  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  festival activities.  While this is  a  good  start,\r\n\r\nmore  has  to  be  done to inculcate a mindset  of  life-long\r\n\r\nlearning in our people.  We will use the lessons learnt  from\r\n\r\nthe  past  year  to  do  more in the coming  year,  including\r\n\r\nredefining  and  improving  the Singapore  Learning  Festival\r\n\r\nwhich will be held later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, we have made progress in implementing\r\n\r\nManpower  21,  but there is still much to be done.   Business\r\n\r\nenvironment and manpower demand are changing rapidly.  We are\r\n\r\nstill   in  the  early  stage  of  realising  Manpower   21's\r\n\r\nobjectives.   The effort to develop our human resource  is  a\r\n\r\nlong  and  continuing challenge.  It will  require  the  full\r\n\r\ncommitment  of workers and employers with Government  support\r\n\r\nto achieve our objective of a globally competitive workforce.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked what would be the optimal\r\n\r\nproportion of foreign workers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin Singapore, how do we balance the number of foreign workers\r\n\r\nwith  the  needs of Singaporeans.  This is an issue that  has\r\n\r\ncome  up  from time to time, as the number of foreign workers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore increases over the years.  In fact,  it  is  an\r\n\r\nemotive issue, but we cannot react emotionally to this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have to be rational, and be driven by economic principles.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that we do need foreign talents because they help\r\n\r\nus  to  be more competitive in a global market.  They add  to\r\n\r\nour  capability and help us to make up for the small  number.\r\n\r\nForeign   talents,   in   fact,  create   opportunities   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  If we adopt a closed door approach,  it  would\r\n\r\nonly  reduce our attractiveness as a business hub  and  force\r\n\r\ninvestment to go elsewhere where talents are more welcomed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only last Friday, 9th March, I saw in the International\r\n\r\nHerald  Tribunal an opinion piece headlined \"The  trends:   A\r\n\r\nworker-hungry Europe in need of immigrants\".  I was a  little\r\n\r\nsurprised.  I  thought Europe still had a  high  unemployment\r\n\r\nrate, although I knew that the European unemployment rate has\r\n\r\ncome  down  over the years, compared to what it  was  several\r\n\r\nyears ago, a double digit unemployment rate.  When I read the\r\n\r\narticle,  I  realise  that  the  writer  had  concluded  that\r\n\r\nEurope's  declining birth rate, widening skills gap  and  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  the  knowledge economy, can  only  be  solved  by\r\n\r\nimporting  talents, and not just talents in  the  information\r\n\r\ntechnology area, but a whole range of talents with the  right\r\n\r\nmix  of  skills needed by the growing industries.  I  believe\r\n\r\nhis observations are quite relevant to our situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of what is the optimal number, I think\r\n\r\nit  is  a  question of how fast is our economy  growing.   In\r\n\r\norder to support the economic growth, in order to meet skills\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the employers and the new industries that  we  are\r\n\r\nattracting to Singapore, we have to continue to adopt an open-door policy as far as foreign talents are concerned.  The way\r\n\r\nto cope with rapid globalisation and changes is, in fact, not\r\n\r\nto  keep foreign talents out.  If we keep them out, they will\r\n\r\njust simply go elsewhere to compete against us.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmost  effective way by which we can help Singaporeans  is  to\r\n\r\ngive  them the tools to compete.  Hence, the Government  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  spend  a  large proportion  of  the  budget  on\r\n\r\neducation for young Singaporeans and our children.  For those\r\n\r\nwho are already in the workforce, we will continue to invest,\r\n\r\nas  I  have described earlier on, in all our skills upgrading\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  so  that older workers can continue  to  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir  skills and maintain their currency in the skills  that\r\n\r\nare needed by the employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to address the point raised by Mr Loh\r\n\r\nabout  the plight of the middle aged managers and executives.\r\n\r\nI recognise the difficulties that this group faces.  For many\r\n\r\naffected managers and executives who are very experienced  in\r\n\r\ntheir  kind of work and with many years of working experience\r\n\r\nto  be  retrenched  is  a  tremendous  shock  and  a  serious\r\n\r\nfinancial  setback.  But as I said, this is a group  that  is\r\n\r\nalready  skilled  and  fairly well-trained.   However,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of economic restructuring, they also face uncertainty\r\n\r\nand  the prospect of retrenchment.  Their years of experience\r\n\r\nmay  have  become  irrelevant  as  industries  or  businesses\r\n\r\nundergo radical changes and are completely transformed.   Let\r\n\r\nme give you an example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local banks are streamlining their operations. Some of\r\n\r\nthem are closing down branches.    We have heard some Members\r\n\r\nmentioning this problem during the Budget debate.  When  that\r\n\r\nhappens, not all the branch managers or the executives in the\r\n\r\nlarger branches can be re-deployed.  Some branch managers  or\r\n\r\nexecutives may face retrenchment, including some of those who\r\n\r\nhave  many years of experience as the branch manager.  It  is\r\n\r\ndifficult  for this group who are middle-age, facing  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation,  to  be  retrenched and  having  to  look  for  an\r\n\r\nalternative job.  Despite the difficulty, I think  there  are\r\n\r\nopportunities available for them but they may  have  to  look\r\n\r\nbeyond their immediate working environment.  They may have to\r\n\r\nbe  prepared  to  look at allied sectors.   If  we  take  the\r\n\r\nexample of the bank manager or the branch manager\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  bank  who has been retrenched, he may have  to  look\r\n\r\nbeyond  banking into insurance, other financial  services  or\r\n\r\ncommerce.   In other words, he must be prepared to widen  his\r\n\r\nchoice  of an alternative job and, at the same time, I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to   emphasise  that  despite  his  years  of  working\r\n\r\nexperience, he must also be prepared to make an effort to  go\r\n\r\nout  and acquire additional and newer skills that are perhaps\r\n\r\nmore  relevant  to  the needs of the labour  market  at  this\r\n\r\nmoment.   And  last  but  not least,  when  faced  with  this\r\n\r\nsituation,  he may also have to be more realistic and  adjust\r\n\r\nhis expectation of what a new job can give him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh supported the Strategic Manpower Conversion\r\n\r\nProgramme  (SMCP) which we introduced in May  last  year.   I\r\n\r\nthank him for his support.  I just want to explain that  this\r\n\r\nprogramme   is  aimed  at  facilitating  the  conversion   of\r\n\r\nprofessionals to take advantage of job opportunities in high-growth   sectors.   We  started  out  by   looking   at   the\r\n\r\ninfocommunications because that is one area  where  there  is\r\n\r\nstrong demand for IT professionals.  We introduced the scheme\r\n\r\ninitially  as an employer-based scheme.  In other words,  you\r\n\r\ncan  only  have  access  to the training  and  the  financial\r\n\r\nsupport through your employer.  But in October last year,  we\r\n\r\nwidened  the  scheme to an individual-based scheme,  so  that\r\n\r\neven  an individual can apply for support under the Strategic\r\n\r\nManpower   Conversion  Programme  through  certain  appointed\r\n\r\norganisations.  To-date, we have about 200 trainees  and  100\r\n\r\nemployers participating in the pilot programme.  Based on the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  this  small-scale pilot  programme,  we  will\r\n\r\nexpand  the  scheme  to  cover more  sectors  which  we  have\r\n\r\nidentified  to have a growing manpower need, and where  there\r\n\r\nis  also a skill mismatch.  Managers and executives, who need\r\n\r\nadditional skills to fit into the new jobs, will benefit from\r\n\r\nthis scheme. They can, in future, sign on for such conversion\r\n\r\ncourses  which will prepare them for the new jobs in the  new\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng has asked for support for workers to\r\n\r\nacquire skills upgrading on their own, and whether they could\r\n\r\napply\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the  Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund for  some  support.\r\n\r\nThe  answer is yes.  As I have said, even in the case of  the\r\n\r\nStrategic  Manpower  Conversion Programme,  we  are  allowing\r\n\r\nindividuals  to  make applications through appointed  agents.\r\n\r\nThe Computer Society is one of the appointed agents that will\r\n\r\nhelp  us  to  promote  this programme.   Under  the  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning  Endowment  Fund, we will also introduce  programmes\r\n\r\nwhich are both employer-based and, at the same time, open  to\r\n\r\nthe individuals, the workers themselves can take advantage of\r\n\r\nthis programme, completely separate from what their employers\r\n\r\nwould provide in the normal course of their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, I mentioned earlier on the National IT\r\n\r\nLiteracy  Programme.  This is a programme  that  is  entirely\r\n\r\ncommunity-based.  We will work with community  organisations.\r\n\r\nIndividuals  can apply for training under this programme  and\r\n\r\nthey  will  get  support,  both from  the  Lifelong  Learning\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund  and  also from the community  organisations.\r\n\r\nEven the Skills Redevelopment Programme has got an individual\r\n\r\ncomponent in it.  I mentioned that we have 20,000-odd  people\r\n\r\ntrained  last  year.   We also have about 7,000  workers  who\r\n\r\nwent through the Skills Redevelopment Programme on their own,\r\n\r\nwithout  the  backing  of employers because  these  were  the\r\n\r\nworkers  who  have  been retrenched. They  went  through  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme with the support of the  self-help  groups. So there is an individual element in the Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme.  Doors are open for individuals  who\r\n\r\nwant  to come forward to take advantage of the programme.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with  Mr  Loh  that  what is  most  important  is  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  faced with this situation, to  quickly  change\r\n\r\ntheir  mindset  and their attitude towards lifelong  learning\r\n\r\nand upgrading their skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee made a very good observation that while\r\n\r\nwe  have  announced  so  many training  programmes,  so  much\r\n\r\nresources are being pumped into skills upgrading and lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning,  how  many  people  are  coming  forward  to   take\r\n\r\nadvantage of this opportunity.  If you look\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat  the  Skills  Redevelopment  Programme,  we  have  made  a\r\n\r\ntremendous effort to promote this programme and over the last\r\n\r\nthree years, about 46,000 people have come forward to sign up\r\n\r\nand participate in the training places that have been offered\r\n\r\nto  them.   Our target is 100,000 in five years.   We  are  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit short, but we believe that with extra efforts this\r\n\r\nyear  and next year, we should be able to meet the target  of\r\n\r\n100,000  workers that we set initially when we  launched  the\r\n\r\nSkills   Redevelopment  Programme.   But  it   will   require\r\n\r\ntremendous  effort  and  we need to  work  closely  with  the\r\n\r\nNational    Trades   Union   Congress,   and   the   employer\r\n\r\norganisations  to  get  them to mobilise  their  workers,  to\r\n\r\nincentivise their workers to go forward for training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that for older workers, there are barriers.\r\n\r\nIt  is  very  difficult for them, having  joined  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  25 years ago, and have not been back to the classroom\r\n\r\nsince  then,  to  begin to think about going  back  into  the\r\n\r\nclassroom to learn a new skill.  These are issues that we are\r\n\r\naddressing  in the kind of training programmes  that  we  can\r\n\r\noffer  and  the environment in which we provide the training.\r\n\r\nWe  will continue to improve the training methodology, course\r\n\r\nmaterials and also make training much more accessible to  the\r\n\r\nolder  workers  who  may  be  very  hard  pressed  for  time,\r\n\r\nincluding the group of workers that Dr Lee mentioned who  are\r\n\r\nholding more than one job. That is why we emphasise part-time\r\n\r\ntraining.  We understand that not many people can afford  the\r\n\r\nluxury of taking time-off from their job completely to go for\r\n\r\nsix  months' full-time training course.  We, in fact, try  to\r\n\r\noffer  as many of our skills upgrading programme on  a  part-time basis, working closely with the ITEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of single parents, these are issues\r\n\r\nwhich  we  will  have  to address.  It  is  not  just  single\r\n\r\nparents, but also housewives who have family duties, who have\r\n\r\nyoung children to look after.  For instance, if we want  them\r\n\r\nto come and join the National IT Literacy Programme, to learn\r\n\r\nhow  to  use the computer, we would have to see what are  the\r\n\r\nbarriers or difficulties that they face. That is why we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwant to work closely with community organisations, whether it\r\n\r\nis  the  community club or the Community Development Council.\r\n\r\nBy  working closely with the community organisations, some of\r\n\r\nthese issues, like having a nearby child care centre that can\r\n\r\nlook after the kids for a couple of hours while the housewife\r\n\r\nis  attending a course, are certainly possibilities  that  we\r\n\r\nshould examine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed the points raised by the\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in\r\n\r\norder to effectively deal with the competition and challenges\r\n\r\nof  the  globalised economy, our workers today  must  undergo\r\n\r\nmany  cycles  of  training  and retraining  throughout  their\r\n\r\nlifetime  in  order  to  remain employable.   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould  try  its  best to help these workers  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nchallenges.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy with the contributions made by the\r\n\r\nSkills  Development  Fund (SDF) all these  years.   In  1999,\r\n\r\namong  those  who were trained under the sponsorship  of  the\r\n\r\nSDF,  the  ratio of workers aged 40 years and above has  been\r\n\r\nincreased to 1:5.  I would like to know whether the SDF  levy\r\n\r\nwould  be  pegged to the median wage.  In this way,  the  SDF\r\n\r\nwill  be able to grow and adjust automatically, so as  to  be\r\n\r\nmore responsive to the training needs of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are lucky to be able to create an average of\r\n\r\n45,000  jobs  a year for our people.  However, we  are  still\r\n\r\nunable  to  avoid  the  problem of  structural  unemployment,\r\n\r\nbecause  the skill levels of some of  our workers are  unable\r\n\r\nto  match the requirements of the new jobs created.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  know whether the Ministry has any measures to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  this  problem, so as to prevent the gap  from  becoming\r\n\r\nwider.   More  importantly, the Government should  strive  to\r\n\r\nproject  more  accurately the manpower needs of  the  various\r\n\r\nsectors, so that workers will not choose the wrong skills  to\r\n\r\nbe trained and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nface  being eliminated at the race.  Only accurate projection\r\n\r\nof market skills requirement can effectively help our workers\r\n\r\nto  take  on the relevant skills training and to successfully\r\n\r\nmigrate  to  the  job areas where their potentials  could  be\r\n\r\nfully developed.   In this way, our workers, particularly the\r\n\r\nolder workers, will  remain employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, at the commencement of this\r\n\r\nBudget  debate,  I  touched on the issue  of  retraining  and\r\n\r\nemployability.  If you recall, Sir, I had mentioned that  for\r\n\r\nmany of these older workers, the issue is not whether they go\r\n\r\nfor training and retraining, but one of re-employability post\r\n\r\ntraining,  particularly for the older workers.   I  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  the Government should perhaps consider giving some  tax\r\n\r\nincentives to the employers to help make it easier for  these\r\n\r\nemployees to be rehired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply, the Minister said, and I summarise it in\r\n\r\nmy   own  words,  that  we  should  not  interfere  with  the\r\n\r\noperations  of the market with such incentives,  which  would\r\n\r\ndistort  its  efficiency.  In other words, what it  means  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government will not, at this stage, be considering\r\n\r\nproposals for tax incentives to encourage employers  to  hire\r\n\r\nolder workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was hoping to hear that the Government will be\r\n\r\nconsidering  any tax incentive at this stage.  As  you  know,\r\n\r\nSir,  a middle-aged employee, who was made redundant and went\r\n\r\nfor   retraining,  may  not  be  in  a  position  to  compete\r\n\r\neffectively   with  the  younger  ones  who   are   similarly\r\n\r\nqualified.   The older employee will probably require  higher\r\n\r\nsalary  because of his commitment to his family, but may  not\r\n\r\nbe  in  a  position  to dictate his requirements  because  of\r\n\r\ncompetition  from the younger employee who, typically,  would\r\n\r\nnot  have as onerous a responsibility for family as the older\r\n\r\nemployee has.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we use tax incentives all the time to induce\r\n\r\ncertain  forms  of  behaviour from the taxpayer  or  even  to\r\n\r\naddress certain market conditions.  For instance, we give tax\r\n\r\nincentives  to  foreign companies to induce them  to  set  up\r\n\r\noperations in Singapore, to encourage spending in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nR&D,  and  to raise funds in the capital market here.   These\r\n\r\nincentives were given because we thought that such incentives\r\n\r\nwould be beneficial to Singapore in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we are asking for here is to level the playing\r\n\r\nfield,  shared  between the older and  the  younger  workers.\r\n\r\nThis, as I have argued earlier, is necessary to maintain  the\r\n\r\nlong-term cohesiveness of our society here.  For this reason,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  I  would  urge the Minister to  consider  such  a\r\n\r\nscheme  of giving tax benefits to companies to make it easier\r\n\r\nfor them to hire older employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, we have increased our mandatory\r\n\r\nretirement  age  to 62 years.  If we are to  follow  our  own\r\n\r\npopulation trends, this will probably need to be increased to\r\n\r\n65  years in the near future, as the average life span of all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans increases.  Indeed, many in the old-age  bracket\r\n\r\nenjoy  keeping  busy by continuing to work,  albeit  in  less\r\n\r\nstressful   capacities,  not  only  because  it  keeps   them\r\n\r\nphysically and mentally healthy, but it is also because there\r\n\r\nis  a psychological need to know that one is still useful and\r\n\r\nfinancially independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone is the extended family system in which the\r\n\r\nsuccessive  younger  members of the  family  look  after  the\r\n\r\nparents  and the older ones in the same household.  Most  old\r\n\r\nparents  now  live  on  their own after  their  children  got\r\n\r\nmarried  and  live apart, and thus have their  own  financial\r\n\r\ncommitments.   Our older workers, especially those  who  have\r\n\r\nlittle personal savings due to low income, need to work  even\r\n\r\nbeyond the retirement age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy restructures further, we may face more\r\n\r\nproblems  in  finding  employment  for  older  workers.   The\r\n\r\nsituation  could  be due to shortcomings of both  sides,  ie,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  older  workers  as well  as  the  employers.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  will surely  look into this matter to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  impediments  to  employment of older  workers  would  be\r\n\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of older workers, there are those who could\r\n\r\nhave lost touch with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlatest  developments,  lack  the  required  skills  and   are\r\n\r\nreluctant to go for training.  Some may not like the prospect\r\n\r\nof their salary lower than the level they used to enjoy.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment,  employers  as  well  as  the  NTUC  representing\r\n\r\nworkers   and   other  groups  have  established  programmes,\r\n\r\nsubsidised training, partial payment of salaries for  workers\r\n\r\nto acquaint them with the latest developments and acquire new\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, the focus has been on older workers. These\r\n\r\nefforts  have been boosted with the enactment of the Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning Endowment Fund.  This is one important way  to  help\r\n\r\nour older workers meaningfully.  The task now is to encourage\r\n\r\nolder  workers  to  take up skills upgrading courses.   There\r\n\r\ncould  still be complacency among our older workers, to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage and act on the schemes available for them.   But  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  make  a  point that  employers  too  have  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility to encourage and support their  older  workers\r\n\r\nto upgrade their skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, there needs to be more effort on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  the employers to start hiring  older  workers,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  they  have acquired  the  relevant  skills.\r\n\r\nThere  needs to be a change in the mindset of some  employers\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to older workers.  It is not uncommon  to  hear\r\n\r\nthat  workers above 40 years old, who have lost  their  jobs,\r\n\r\ncomplain  that they have been turned away, because  they  are\r\n\r\nconsidered too old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies tend to generalise about older workers,\r\n\r\nbelieving  that  older workers are likely to  get  sick  more\r\n\r\noften,   and   are  slow  to  pick  up  new  skills.    These\r\n\r\ngeneralisations do not fit many older workers, especially  in\r\n\r\nan  ageless on-line environment that operates in an  industry\r\n\r\nlike  the IT industry.  In fact, many retrained older workers\r\n\r\ncombine professional experience with fresh IT skills.   Their\r\n\r\nattitudes  are  progressive and  positive.   In  the  service\r\n\r\nindustry,  older workers bring a lot of wisdom  and  maturity\r\n\r\nwhich   have  been  learned  on  the  job.   This  sense   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility is much greater, because of the financial  and\r\n\r\nfamily commitment they have taken on with age.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers have also a lot of preconceived assumptions\r\n\r\nabout  older  workers.  For example, some assume  that  older\r\n\r\nworkers  will  be unwilling or unable to work  longer  hours,\r\n\r\nwhich studies in the US have found to be untrue.  They assume\r\n\r\nthat  older  workers  will only be  willing  to  accept  high\r\n\r\nsalaries  without  even giving them the  opportunity  for  an\r\n\r\ninterview  and, worst of all, they assume that older  workers\r\n\r\nhave  less  commitment and energy, which is  untrue,  because\r\n\r\nmany  older workers are more committed to their careers after\r\n\r\nspending much time and effort carving out a career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Dr Jennifer Lee that perhaps, in some\r\n\r\ninstances,  it  is  timely that older workers  are  not  only\r\n\r\nretrained   in  new  skills  but  also  offered  counselling,\r\n\r\nincluding  how to present and approach prospective employers.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, employers need to be more aware that  they\r\n\r\nhave  discriminatory assumptions which can  lead  them  to  a\r\n\r\nwrong  conclusion about older workers.  In  the  face  of  an\r\n\r\nageing population, perhaps employers and employer federations\r\n\r\nshould   be   looking  at  ways  and  means  to  reduce   the\r\n\r\npreconceptions  that  some of their  members  may  have.   In\r\n\r\nunionised companies, I am sure we can work out ways  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether  between the unions and the management  in  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat we can encourage more older workers to be retrained  and\r\n\r\nto continue to enjoy employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Government, I hope the Ministry can\r\n\r\nassess  the implementation of the new retirement age  at  62.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it  has been implemented only since 1999,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to suggest that discussions among representatives of the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement, employers and the Government can be started\r\n\r\nwith  a  view  to  phasing  the  eventual  extension  of  the\r\n\r\nretirement age to 67.  I think they have implemented the  new\r\n\r\nretirement  age at 62 long enough to study the  problems  and\r\n\r\nopportunities on both sides of workers and employers, and see\r\n\r\nhow we can extend to 65 first, and later to 67.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can also help by encouraging more and\r\n\r\nmore  companies to embrace job redesign, so that  there  will\r\n\r\nalways be jobs that are relevant to older workers, especially\r\n\r\nfor  those who have put in many loyal years to the companies.\r\n\r\nThrough  job  redesigning, companies can  reassign  functions\r\n\r\nwhich  are  suitable to the physical make up of  these  older\r\n\r\nworkers  without  having to bear too  much  additional  cost,\r\n\r\nespecially for workers who have attained relevant skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should companies resort to employing and be allowed\r\n\r\nto  engage  foreign work permit holders when they can  employ\r\n\r\nlocal workers who can do the same job?  I would like to  echo\r\n\r\nthe  views of some of our colleagues here, especially Mr  Sin\r\n\r\nBoon  Ann who spoke before me, of the need to consider fiscal\r\n\r\nincentives  in  order  to  encourage  employers  to  consider\r\n\r\nemploying older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of our older workers is not going away\r\n\r\nwith   the   recovery  of  our  economy  after  the  economic\r\n\r\nrecession.  In fact, I think we are going to face  more  such\r\n\r\nproblems  as  our  economy  continues  to  restructure.   The\r\n\r\ntripartite  partners should work more closely to address  the\r\n\r\nissue  of employment and re-employment of older workers,  and\r\n\r\neven  facilitate contract work as well as part-time work,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  help  our  older workers  to  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nfinancially independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, recently, the\r\n\r\nGovernment talked a lot about the Singapore 21 vision and  to\r\n\r\naffirm  that every Singaporean counts.  The Manpower Ministry\r\n\r\nalso  published  a report called Manpower 21, which  contains\r\n\r\nmany  recommendations on how to meet the  needs  of  manpower\r\n\r\nresources in the future.  But the report does not specify how\r\n\r\nwe  should solve the unemployment problem of the elderly  and\r\n\r\nless  educated workers.  Although the retirement age has been\r\n\r\nraised  to   62 years,  many people in the 40s told  me  that\r\n\r\nwhen  they  went  to apply for jobs, they were  told  by  the\r\n\r\nemployers that they were too old to be employed.  Those  less\r\n\r\neducated   or   uneducated  workers,  particularly   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry, are unable to find\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalternative  jobs once they are retrenched.   This  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  remains  the  same  ever  since  the  1998  regional\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis.  I have, on more than one occasion,  raised\r\n\r\nthis  matter in Parliament, but I have not seen any  concrete\r\n\r\nmeasures  being adopted by the Government to help  those  low\r\n\r\nincome workers.  Although the Prime Minister has appealed  to\r\n\r\nemployers  not  to discriminate against older  workers,  such\r\n\r\nappeal seems to have fallen on deaf ears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Ministry of Manpower has all sorts of job\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes.   But  according  to  a  Straits  Times\r\n\r\nreport,   a  survey conducted by MOM revealed that those  who\r\n\r\nattended  the  skills upgrading programmes are  mostly  young\r\n\r\neducated  workers.  That being the case, how do such training\r\n\r\nprogrammes help the less educated workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a few questions. First, what is MOM's\r\n\r\nattitude  towards the plight of those less educated  workers?\r\n\r\nDoes  it  think that these people are beyond redemption,  and\r\n\r\nare  better left to fend for themselves?  Second,  after  MOM\r\n\r\nhas  identified the causes for the reluctance of  these  less\r\n\r\neducated and older workers to go for training, what is  MOM's\r\n\r\nreaction?    Third,  has MOM formulated  a  policy  specially\r\n\r\ntailored to address the unemployment problem of this group of\r\n\r\nlowly paid workers?\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, my main concern is\r\n\r\nthe  training of our older workers.  All along,  our  leaders\r\n\r\nhave called on our workers, especially older ones, to upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir  skills because they are usually the ones  with  higher\r\n\r\nrisk  of  losing  their jobs.  While we fully understand  the\r\n\r\nimportance of skills upgrading, we must also be sensitive  to\r\n\r\nthe needs of older workers.  We must have read many times  in\r\n\r\nthe  papers  how our older workers, despite having  taken  up\r\n\r\nadvice to upgrade their skills, are still turned away at  job\r\n\r\ninterviews.  In many cases highlighted, it is not  that  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  possess the right skills or mindset, but more  often\r\n\r\nthan not, it is their age which prevents them from securing a\r\n\r\njob.  Many employers though\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  not openly admit this.  Although at the height  of  the\r\n\r\nrecession in 1998, the tripartite partners did come  up  with\r\n\r\nsome  form  of  guidelines not to discriminate against  older\r\n\r\nworkers, it seems this has fallen on deaf ears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many older workers now want to know what the Government\r\n\r\nhas  done  or is planning to do to address the above worrying\r\n\r\ntrends.   From my feedback, individual Ministries  have  also\r\n\r\nembarked   on   outsourcing  their  operations   to   private\r\n\r\ncontractors, for example, the Ministry of the Environment has\r\n\r\nfarmed  out some of its cleaning work to private contractors.\r\n\r\nMany  older  workers  are  definitely  affected  in  such   a\r\n\r\nsituation.   Will  these private companies  continue  to  re-employ  these older workers?  If these older workers are  not\r\n\r\nre-employed,  what happens to them?  Does the  Ministry  show\r\n\r\nany concern to these workers or help them find alternative re-employment  with  these  new private contractors?   If  these\r\n\r\ncontractors  refuse to employ these older  workers,  does  it\r\n\r\nmean  that  these  private contractors  will  go  to  recruit\r\n\r\nyounger  foreign workers?  Perhaps the Ministry  of  Manpower\r\n\r\nshould examine our existing recruitment policy and guidelines\r\n\r\non older workers employed in the public service and statutory\r\n\r\nboards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our leaders have helped these older workers to\r\n\r\nseek  other  jobs,  very  few  concrete  measures  have  been\r\n\r\nformulated to help them.  I hope that we will not  just  talk\r\n\r\nabout  it.  Therefore, I would urge MOM to take this lead  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate with the relevant Ministries and statutory  boards\r\n\r\nto  set a good example by taking concrete measures to recruit\r\n\r\nolder workers in their departments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I too add my voice to the plight\r\n\r\nof  older  workers,  many  of them may  not  have  sufficient\r\n\r\nschooling  or  skills.   They are at  the  greatest  risk  of\r\n\r\nretrenchments and once they lose their jobs, it is  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  them  to get another job, even at a lower pay.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, these older workers need a job badly, because they\r\n\r\nare  usually  at a phase in their life where their  financial\r\n\r\ncommitments are highest.  They have a mortgage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  settle,  children to educate and families to  take  care.\r\n\r\nWhile they need jobs, employers are reluctant to employ older\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore need to get these employers to change their\r\n\r\nattitude and values of these older people.  The needs of  the\r\n\r\nolder workers are beyond training and retraining.  They  need\r\n\r\ncounselling and assistance to learn how to learn.  If nothing\r\n\r\nis done and the situation is allowed to continue, we could be\r\n\r\nmaking  a  mockery  of our legislation on  the  extension  of\r\n\r\nretirement  age.  Older workers may not be forced  to  retire\r\n\r\nearly,  but  they could be easily retrenched and not  be  re-employed  on  decent and dignified incomes.   We  should  not\r\n\r\nallow  this  situation  to continue  and  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to work on this with some urgency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, since many Members before me\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned about the issue, I would not want to  repeat,\r\n\r\nbut  would like to ask the Ministry whether it will  consider\r\n\r\nraising  the  retirement age beyond  62  years  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, lately, when someone talks\r\n\r\nabout  lifelong learning, I observe that they like  to  quote\r\n\r\nthe Chinese saying of  \"                            .\"\r\n\r\nWhile  older  workers understand the importance  of  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning,  they  are more concerned about the their  lifelong\r\n\r\nemployability.  So they ask, can we \"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"? In short, they want to be reassured that after they\r\n\r\nreceive the necessary training, they can get a job, and  that\r\n\r\nis crucial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At many of the dialogue sessions, Singaporeans expressed\r\n\r\ntheir concern that as more and more companies restructure and\r\n\r\nwith  the  development in technology, the older and the  less\r\n\r\neducated   workers  tend  to  be  retrenched.   Despite   the\r\n\r\nretraining  they  receive, they notice that employers  prefer\r\n\r\nyounger workers.  Thus, they perceive the age discrimination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for those who have a job at the moment, they are also\r\n\r\nworried about their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njob  security.   One union leader said at a  session,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote,  \"We need a job.  We older workers are concerned  that\r\n\r\nif  we  are out of job, we have to go back home to  face  the\r\n\r\nwife and the wall.  That will be very stressful.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he received big applause from other fellow workers.\r\n\r\nThat  shows  that they all agreed with him that it  was  very\r\n\r\nstressful without work.  But I do not know whether they  also\r\n\r\nagreed  with him that facing the wife, and especially  facing\r\n\r\nthe wall at home, was also stressful.  But I can imagine that\r\n\r\nlife  without  a roof and four walls and without  a  wife  is\r\n\r\nequally stressful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"WWW\" is the in-thing nowadays, which means world wide\r\n\r\nweb  to  the youngsters.  I was told that the soldiers  refer\r\n\r\n\"www\" as wine, women and war.  But to the workers, especially\r\n\r\nto the older ones, the \"www\" means work, wife and walls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern of age discrimination in the employment\r\n\r\nmarket  should be addressed.  Recently, there was a  proposal\r\n\r\nto  form  a  watchdog body similar to the  equal  opportunity\r\n\r\ncommission  found  in  the US, UK, Hong Kong  and  Australia.\r\n\r\nWatchdog  body means another \"W\" which workers can  turn  to.\r\n\r\nBut,  in my view, our unions have been playing an active role\r\n\r\nin  ensuring  that older workers are not being discriminated.\r\n\r\nWe  may  not  see eye to eye in some of the things  with  the\r\n\r\nemployers;  however, we should work hand  in  hand  with  the\r\n\r\nmanagement and Government in resolving this concern.  And, in\r\n\r\nfact, this has happened in a smaller way in the petrochemical\r\n\r\nindustry  where  older workers are being  retrained  and  re-employed  after their retraining.  And I must admit  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  do  more  to  ensure  that  workers  are  not   being\r\n\r\ndiscriminated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Minister to re-consider\r\n\r\nif  an incentive package could be given to employers who  re-employ  older  workers  after  they  have  gone  through  the\r\n\r\nretraining.  I believe this is one of the more effective ways\r\n\r\nto   get   older  workers  employed.   Our  National   Skills\r\n\r\nRecognition System has also created\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopportunities for workers to have their skills certified  and\r\n\r\nmade it easier for them to gain recognition by the employers.\r\n\r\nIt  is  through this concerted effort that the perception  of\r\n\r\nage discrimination can be checked, and I believe that this is\r\n\r\na  more  pragmatic approach towards the issue and  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat older workers will get the right type of \"www\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, let me respond to all the hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  who  spoke  so eloquently on  behalf  of  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers.   The  Government  shares their  concern  about  the\r\n\r\nplight of the older workers, but we have to go about tackling\r\n\r\nthis  problem  in  a  rational  and  sound  way.   Structural\r\n\r\nunemployment  -  higher unemployment rate for  older,  lower-skilled  workers  -  is  not  a problem  that  is  unique  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is a problem that is also being experienced in\r\n\r\nother  countries.  You will see this problem emerging in  the\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries,  as stated in the  International  Herald\r\n\r\nTribune  article  last Friday which I mentioned  earlier  on.\r\n\r\nThey  also have a problem - ageing workforce, widening skills\r\n\r\ngap;  as  a  result, older workers are having more difficulty\r\n\r\nstaying employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us not fall into a rhetoric trap. Mr Low said,\r\n\r\n\"What has the Government done about these older workers?\"  He\r\n\r\nraised  several points.  What are our policies, what are  our\r\n\r\nplans  to help the older workers?  He said that there are  no\r\n\r\nconcrete  measures by the Government.  I think that  is  very\r\n\r\nfar  from the truth of what has actually happened in the last\r\n\r\nthree  years.   Mr Low knows very well that we have  taken  a\r\n\r\nvery  strong interest and deep concern on the plight  of  the\r\n\r\nolder workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example of what we have been doing.\r\n\r\nWe  actually  promote training for older  workers  much  more\r\n\r\naggressively than for any other sector.  We work closely with\r\n\r\nboth the Productivity and Standards Board, the NTUC and self-help  groups,  to  market  and to  package  skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogrammes targeted at the older workers.  We even give older\r\n\r\nworkers  special funding support.  In the case of  those  who\r\n\r\nare  40  and  above, we provide the higher level of  funding.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a person, aged 40 and above,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsigns  up for a SRP training programme, he will receive  100%\r\n\r\nof  the  cost  fee  subsidy.  In other  words,  these  people\r\n\r\nreceive  free  training.  And if they are  already  employed,\r\n\r\nthen  their  employers  will  receive  85%  absentee  payroll\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  instead of 70% for the younger workers.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  there  is  already  additional  incentive  given   to\r\n\r\nemployers to train their older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have introduced measures to specially address the\r\n\r\nneeds of this older group of workers.  The first and foremost\r\n\r\nissue  is  how do we equip the older workers with the  skills\r\n\r\nthat are needed in the workplace.  It is no use talking about\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  help  them  get  jobs  if  the  older   workers\r\n\r\nthemselves do not have the skills for the jobs.  You can give\r\n\r\nyour employers all the tax incentives that they want, you can\r\n\r\ngive them all the benefits that they want, but if the workers\r\n\r\ncannot  do the job because they do not have the skills,  then\r\n\r\nthey  will not be hired for the job.  Today's marketplace  is\r\n\r\nvery  competitive.  If you do not have the workers  with  the\r\n\r\nright  set  of  skills, who can deliver the  product  or  the\r\n\r\nservice  productively and efficiently, you  will  go  out  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  No amount of tax incentives can help you  to  stay\r\n\r\nin business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first and foremost challenge is to equip our\r\n\r\nolder  workers with the right skill set, and this is what  we\r\n\r\nare  doing.  That is why we are providing more incentives for\r\n\r\nthe  older  workers.   That is why  we  have  introduced  the\r\n\r\nNational Skills Recognition System, which is aimed at meeting\r\n\r\nthe  skills  upgrading needs of older workers who lack  basic\r\n\r\neducation.   That  is why we design the  system  to  be  open\r\n\r\nentry.  In other words, anybody can walk in and sign on for a\r\n\r\ncourse under the National Skills Recognition System.  You  do\r\n\r\nnot  need to have a Secondary Four Leaving Certificate.   You\r\n\r\ndo  not need to have completed your Secondary Three.  You  do\r\n\r\nnot  even need to have completed your PSLE.  All you need  to\r\n\r\ndo  is to show an interest in upgrading your skills.  We will\r\n\r\nfind  you  an  appropriate  area where  your  skills  can  be\r\n\r\nupgraded,  certified, and we will then help you  to  find  an\r\n\r\nappropriate job.  So I think that is the most important\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthing,  and  we should not be distracted by this  feeling  of\r\n\r\nhopelessness, that there is nothing we can do about it.  That\r\n\r\nis  far  from  the truth.  The truth is that  we  are  making\r\n\r\ntremendous effort to address the needs of the older  workers,\r\n\r\nand we will continue to do so, but in a coherent and sensible\r\n\r\nmanner that will yield results.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would also like to point out that, of the\r\n\r\n40,000  workers who have gone for skills upgrading under  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme, about 30% of them are in fact\r\n\r\nthe older workers.  So older workers are receiving their fair\r\n\r\nshare of support, in terms of skills upgrading and, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier  on  when I reported on  the  progress  of  the\r\n\r\nManpower  21  Plan,  those who have been through  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme actually saw enhancement in their job\r\n\r\ncapability  and 40% had increases in pay.  And employers  saw\r\n\r\nthem  as  being  more productive workers.  So these  findings\r\n\r\nconfirm what we believe, that an older worker can be equally,\r\n\r\nif  not,  more productive and efficient as a younger  worker.\r\n\r\nAnd  employers should of course give older workers  a  chance\r\n\r\nfor  any  job vacancy that is available provided, of  course,\r\n\r\nthat  the older worker himself has taken the trouble to equip\r\n\r\nhimself with the right skills and right competency to be able\r\n\r\nto cope with the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Development Fund also supports about 160,000\r\n\r\ntraining  places  for older workers last year.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease from 130,000 training places that were supported  by\r\n\r\nthe  Skills Development Fund for older workers.  So  in  many\r\n\r\ndifferent  areas, we are reaching out to the older  group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  by  helping  them to upgrade  their  skills  to\r\n\r\nprepare them for the knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked whether the skills\r\n\r\ndevelopment levy will be linked to the median wage level.  We\r\n\r\nhave announced that when we were going to increase the skills\r\n\r\ndevelopment levy.  We will also make regular adjustment.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nannouncement was made last year and what we said was that  we\r\n\r\nwould adjust the skills development levy contribution ceiling\r\n\r\nto  $2,000 by the year 2004.  The first increase from  $1,000\r\n\r\nto  $1,500  took  effect  only on 1st  July  last  year  and,\r\n\r\nsubsequently, we will raise it in steps, $1,800 in  2002  and\r\n\r\nthen  $2,000  in  2004.  This we have already announced  last\r\n\r\nyear  and  we have implemented it in July last year.   Beyond\r\n\r\n2004,  we  will  review whether we need regular  updating  or\r\n\r\nreview  of  the  ceiling, or peg it  to  some  measures,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, such as the median wage level.  We will have a look\r\n\r\nat it again after 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi and, again, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also asked\r\n\r\nwhether we would raise the retirement age currently pegged at\r\n\r\n62.   We  introduced this minimum retirement age or statutory\r\n\r\nretirement age of 62 in 1999.  So we have about two years  of\r\n\r\nexperience to work with this new retirement age.  We will  be\r\n\r\nlooking  at  whether there is a need to review this  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture.   Of  course,  in  the  longer  term,  Government's\r\n\r\nintention is to raise the retirement age to 67.  The question\r\n\r\nis whether we should now introduce a higher retirement age of\r\n\r\n65,  at  this  juncture, or we should wait till the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation becomes more stable before we initiate this review.\r\n\r\nWe  would  like to wait a little bit longer to  see  what  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  happen  in the light of the possibility  that  the\r\n\r\neconomy  will slow down before we make another move.   So  we\r\n\r\nwill  have to wait till the later part of the year  after  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  clearer feel of the economy in the next one  or  two\r\n\r\nyears before we commence a review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me reassure Members that the intention remains\r\n\r\nthe  same.   We  intend to raise the retirement  age  at  the\r\n\r\nappropriate time from 62 to 65, and then on to 67.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the Members have basically raised the same\r\n\r\npoint  about  what  we  are going to do  to  help  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers.  Mr Seng Han Thong spoke about the older workers and\r\n\r\nasked   whether  we  could  reconsider  incentives   to   the\r\n\r\nemployers.  My point is that, in response to Mr Seng  and  Mr\r\n\r\nSin  Boon Ann's request for tax incentives, we should not  go\r\n\r\nin and micro\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanage and interfere in the labour market in this fashion  to\r\n\r\nthe  point  where you would say that if you employ  an  older\r\n\r\nworker,  I  would  give you a special incentive  or  subsidy.\r\n\r\nWhat  we should do is we should ensure that the older workers\r\n\r\nare  fully  equipped with the skills that will be needed  for\r\n\r\nthe  job.   But at the same time, we should not make  it  too\r\n\r\neasy  for  employers  to substitute our  local  workers  with\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  That is why we will continue, and  I  will\r\n\r\ntouch  on  it  later on in our discussion on the  section  on\r\n\r\nforeign  workers, to have restrictive measures in place  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the entry of lower skilled foreign  workers,  ie,\r\n\r\nwork permit holders.  This is to ensure that our employers do\r\n\r\nnot become overly dependent on foreign workers at the expense\r\n\r\nof our Singaporean workers, particularly the older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we take that approach, we make every effort to\r\n\r\ntrain our older workers to give them the new skills that  are\r\n\r\nin  demand  and, if the older workers respond  positively  by\r\n\r\ncoming  forward  to accept the training,  then  we  would  be\r\n\r\nmaking some headway in resolving this problem.  It was Mr Low\r\n\r\nwho  mentioned  that  the training went only  to  the  better\r\n\r\neducated  workers and that we had ignored the older  workers.\r\n\r\nThat  is not true.  As I said earlier, in my response on  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme, a lot of efforts have gone to\r\n\r\nthe older workers and older workers have come forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is true is that among those who did not undergo any\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading, many of them are in fact  the  unemployed.\r\n\r\nThey  are in fact the group most in need.  They had not  gone\r\n\r\nfor  the  skills  upgrading.  That is why they  still  remain\r\n\r\nunemployed  because  they have not got the  skills  that  the\r\n\r\nemployers need.  So, in effect, what we need to do is to  get\r\n\r\nthis group of unemployed, particularly, the older unemployed,\r\n\r\nto  come  forward to take advantage of our various  upgrading\r\n\r\nand retraining programmes so that they can acquire new skills\r\n\r\nand  then we can be in a better position to help them to look\r\n\r\nfor new jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi mentioned about the contract and part-time\r\n\r\nwork, as a measure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  help  older workers.  That is one possible approach.   We\r\n\r\nwill  look  at how part-time work and contract  work  can  be\r\n\r\nbetter  organised  in order to create more job  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  older  workers.  But the flip side of the coin  is  that\r\n\r\nsome  older  workers  do not want to hold  a  full-time  job,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those  who  are near their  retirement  age  or\r\n\r\nalready  past the age of 62.  They are fit, they are healthy,\r\n\r\nthey are able bodied and they can work.  But they do not want\r\n\r\nto  hold  a full-time job.  So for this group, maybe a  part-time or contract work may be useful for them.  So we will  be\r\n\r\nlooking  at  how this can be further improved and  made  more\r\n\r\nattractive  so that they will remain gainfully employed  and,\r\n\r\nin a way, also contribute to our manpower resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to reiterate the point\r\n\r\nthat,  as  far  as  the  older workers  are  concerned,  some\r\n\r\nemployers  may  have  a  misconception  that  they  are  less\r\n\r\ncapable,  less  productive, less efficient.  Mr  Hawazi  also\r\n\r\nmade the point that employers should be more prepared to give\r\n\r\nolder workers an opportunity.  As the Government, what we can\r\n\r\ndo  is to help employers who are willing to take this step to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  older workers that he  recruits  would  be\r\n\r\ntrained  to  the  skill level that he  needs.   And  this  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  what  we  are  doing through  the  various  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  programme that we have already put in place.   Any\r\n\r\nemployer  who today wants to employ an older worker,  but  is\r\n\r\nnot  quite certain of his capability, can always recruit  the\r\n\r\nworker and then have the worker trained, or skills certified,\r\n\r\nso that they can be assured that he will be able to do a good\r\n\r\njob once he is hired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that Mr Hawazi mentioned is the fact\r\n\r\nthat  older workers do not only need the training  or  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading, they also need some counselling.  I agree with him\r\n\r\nentirely.  This is the same point that Dr Jennifer  Lee  made\r\n\r\nearlier  on  that they need more than just skills  upgrading.\r\n\r\nThey  need some guidance, they need some counselling.  For  a\r\n\r\nstart,  even in skills upgrading, they need to be  guided  in\r\n\r\nwhat type, which area to go in for and which area of skills\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nupgrading should they embark on because they may not be aware\r\n\r\nof  the  changes that have taken place in the labour  market,\r\n\r\nthat  the  demand for skills set has changed.  And  today,  a\r\n\r\nwhole new set of skills is being required by employers.  That\r\n\r\nis  why we are pioneering this one-stop career centre and  we\r\n\r\nwant  to work with the community organisations to expand this\r\n\r\nnetwork so that workers, particularly older workers, can have\r\n\r\neasy  access  to  such counselling services  where  they  can\r\n\r\napproach  professionals who are well informed of  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  trends and demands of the growth sectors  where  jobs\r\n\r\nare  plentiful,  but jobs which require workers  with  higher\r\n\r\nskills.   So older workers can go to one-stop career  centres\r\n\r\nto seek advice and counselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have indicated earlier on, in my response on the\r\n\r\nprogress  of  Manpower 21 strategy, that the result  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  got from our one-stop career centre at the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower has been quite encouraging.  People who turn up have\r\n\r\nfound  it useful.  We would like to multiply this experience.\r\n\r\nWe  would like to increase the number of such centres.  It is\r\n\r\nbest to have them located conveniently in the housing estates\r\n\r\nso  that older workers, housewives and women who have  family\r\n\r\nduties  can all turn up.  If they need advice or counselling,\r\n\r\nit can be made available to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered the points that were raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I seek clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister?   Sir, I understand there were various  programmes,\r\n\r\nlike Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMy  point  is whether these programmes are focused enough  to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem  of  the  unemployed  older  workers.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  only  about  23%  of  older  workers   have\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  the programme.  Is the  Minister  satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the  participation rate of the  older  workers  in  the\r\n\r\ntraining  programme?  The Minister is correct in saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  unemployed  older workers are the main problem  now.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to know from the Minister what he has in mind  in\r\n\r\nreaching  out  to  this  group of workers  specifically,  and\r\n\r\ndesign  programmes for them in order that  they  can  be  re-employed.   Lastly,  I would like to know from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  macro level of the problem  and  what  is  the\r\n\r\nmagnitude  of  the problem of this group of workers  who  are\r\n\r\nolder and less educated.  And what is the target, ie, whether\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry has set any target to reach them and to resolve\r\n\r\nthe problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
