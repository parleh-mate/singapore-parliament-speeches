The Malaysian  Government  has\r\n\r\nnever   given  to  the  University  of  Singapore   any\r\n\r\nfinancial  aid as such. Any contribution  made  by  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government was in respect  of  the  cost  of\r\n\r\neducating  Malaysian students studying in the Singapore\r\n\r\nUniversity.  Similarly, the Singapore  Government  also\r\n\r\nmade  contributions to the University of Malaya to meet\r\n\r\nthe cost of educating our students there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the separation of the then University of\r\n\r\nMalaya  into  two separate universities, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  Federation of  Malaya  Government\r\n\r\njointly   contributed  on  an  agreed  formula  towards\r\n\r\ndefraying  the  cost  of running the  University  which\r\n\r\nserves  students from both territories. The outstanding\r\n\r\ncontributions from the Malaysian Government, on  behalf\r\n\r\nof   their  students  studying  in  the  University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  the years 1962 to 1966, were  discussed\r\n\r\nand  concluded at official level recently and  official\r\n\r\nconfirmation is awaited from the Malaysian  Government.\r\n\r\nAs  a result of these discussions, a sum of $20 million\r\n\r\nwas  accepted  as the liability for Malaysian  students\r\n\r\nstudying  in  the University of Singapore  between  the\r\n\r\nyears 1962 and 1966. Of this, an advance payment of $10\r\n\r\nmillion  was  made  in  December  1965.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment   also  agreed  to  settle   in   full   all\r\n\r\noutstanding  dues  and claims on  behalf  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents studying in the University of Malaya.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Singapore students studying in the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, the contributions have been\r\n\r\noutstanding   for  the  years  1964   to   1966.   This\r\n\r\nsettlement,   when   confirmed,   will   conclude   all\r\n\r\noutstanding  inter-University financial matters  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  this year. For 1967 it has been  proposed\r\n\r\nthat a joint Treasury Committee \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe set up to re-examine all contributions to the\r\n\r\ntwo  Universities  by the respective Governments  on  a\r\n\r\nrevised  basis  reflecting  present-day  conditions.

All these recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe   Commission  were  accepted  and  implemented   by\r\n\r\nGovernment. There were a number of disputed  grades  on\r\n\r\nwhich even the Commission was not in a position to make\r\n\r\ndirect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecommendations  and, as the Member is  aware,  on  the\r\n\r\ninstructions of the Prime Minister, steps were taken to\r\n\r\ntry  to  effect a speedy remedy. Settlement was reached\r\n\r\non  a  number of these disputed grades. A few remaining\r\n\r\ndisputed  grades and grievance procedure  were  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  subjects which the representatives of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\nand the Federation discussed with the Prime Minister on\r\n\r\n6th  December. The Prime Minister has indicated at  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  that  there could be further  negotiations  on\r\n\r\nthese  outstanding matters, failing which  the  matters\r\n\r\ncould  be  referred  to  him for  a  settlement.  As  a\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry was appointed in  1963  to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  matter which the Member for Bras  Basah  has\r\n\r\nraised,  I do not see any reason for another Commission\r\n\r\nof Inquiry to be appointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a thorough re-organisation of public\r\n\r\nservice  departments to settle grievances,  the  Member\r\n\r\nknows  that  a grievance procedure was the  subject  of\r\n\r\ndiscussion between Government, the Federation  and  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C, as  a  result of instructions  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister to which I have referred. Proposals for a fair\r\n\r\nand reasonable grievance procedure which does not block\r\n\r\nor  hinder  management are already with the  Federation\r\n\r\nand the N.T.U.C. As far as the Cleansing Department  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health is concerned, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ninformed the N.T.U.C. and the Federation at the meeting\r\n\r\non  6th  December  that  a two-shift  system  would  be\r\n\r\nintroduced as from 3rd January, 1967, with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  efficiency and  productivity  of  that\r\n\r\nDepartment.

I was  trying  to  do  some\r\n\r\nresearch the other day on the Finance Minister's Budget\r\n\r\nSpeech  and  I found that there was only one  title  on\r\n\r\npublic finance. There are no books on economics at all,\r\n\r\nnone  on  sociology,  a  handful on  the  parliamentary\r\n\r\nsystem,  hardly  any  on  the  comparative  system   of\r\n\r\ngovernment and practically none on politics.  There  is\r\n\r\nnot  even a set of Encyclopaedia Britannica or a set of encyclopaedia on the social sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed from the Suggestion Book in the Library that\r\n\r\nin 1961 a Member did suggest that the Library acquire a\r\n\r\nset  of  Encyclopaedia Britannica, but this  suggestion\r\n\r\nwas  turned  down  by the then House  Committee,  by  a\r\n\r\nmajority, but without giving any reasons. Possibly  the\r\n\r\nthen  House Committee consisted of Members who  had  no\r\n\r\nuse for reference books!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will agree with me that the\r\n\r\npresent  stock  of  books  in  the  Library  is  hardly\r\n\r\nadequate.  This lack of reference material hampers  the\r\n\r\nwork  of  hon. Members, and this year's estimate  of  a\r\n\r\nmiserable sum of $800 is hardly sufficient to meet  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  From a cursory look into the  estimates  on\r\n\r\nthe  book  votes  for other departments,  most  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartments,  however minor, appear to  have  a  larger\r\n\r\nvote for books than Parliament. I will just give a  few\r\n\r\nexamples: the book vote for Postal Services, $920;  for\r\n\r\nCivil  Aviation, $2,000; for the Trade Division, $1,250\r\n\r\nand  for the Foreign Ministry, $6,000.

We decided,  as\r\n\r\nfrom 1966, to reinstitute these scholarships which were\r\n\r\npreviously   known   as  Queen's  Scholarships.   These\r\n\r\nscholarships,  which were highly prized  by  successive\r\n\r\ngenerations of students, were instrumental in getting a\r\n\r\nsmall corps of able and highly-trained men into several\r\n\r\nof the professions then open. With the establishment of\r\n\r\nthe  University  of Singapore, these scholarships  were\r\n\r\ntransferred to the University to be used by way of post-graduate courses. However, my colleagues and I have for\r\n\r\nsome time been rather concerned with the problems which\r\n\r\nhave not altogether been resolved in the University, in\r\n\r\nthrowing  up  people  who not only  have  the  academic\r\n\r\ntraining   and   intellectual  discipline,   but   also\r\n\r\nqualities  of  leadership and an  interest  in  matters\r\n\r\noutside  their particular field of discipline.

But the\r\n\r\nstudents  who win these scholarships usually  also  win\r\n\r\nother scholarships, and when they do that, as a mark of\r\n\r\ndistinction over and above the other students who  have\r\n\r\nwon  similar  scholarships, they get an additional  \u00a350\r\n\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that any student anywhere in the\r\n\r\nworld can survive on \u00a350 per annum, but the \u00a350 is only\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  student who has,  before  he  gets  the\r\n\r\nPresident's scholarship, already qualified\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor some other scholarship.

I  have  very\r\n\r\nvivid memories of my stay in Malaysia Hall. It was then\r\n\r\ncalled Malaya Hall. This is a place where students from\r\n\r\nboth  Singapore  and  West  Malaysia  -  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, in  fact  -  can meet in  an  atmosphere  of\r\n\r\ngoodwill and discuss the problems confronting  them  in\r\n\r\ntheir studies as well as their other problems. It would\r\n\r\nbe  a matter for regret, Mr Speaker, Sir, if Singapore\r\n\r\nstudents  and Malaysian students so far away are  being\r\n\r\nseparated. The decision to separate them, however,  may\r\n\r\nnot  be within the control of our Government. But as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said, I am glad that the Government is continuing\r\n\r\nto  support the running of the Hall, and I do urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that, as long as it could do so,  it  should\r\n\r\ncontinue to support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is a subject which has drawn\r\n\r\nconsiderable  comment from other political  leaders  in\r\n\r\nother  countries, and I would like to  state  just  the\r\n\r\nbare facts.

Likewise the number\r\n\r\nof  industries also increases and needs workers of high\r\n\r\ncalibre. If the Government wants Malay children to have\r\n\r\nhigh qualifications in order that they can compete with\r\n\r\nnon-Malays,  whether in education or other fields,  and\r\n\r\nalso  wants  an increasing number of Malays to  receive\r\n\r\nhigher education, then it should increase the vote  for\r\n\r\n1967.  Instead,  it has been reduced. Could  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  explain the reason for the reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nvote for 1967 as compared with 1966?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the short and direct answer\r\n\r\nto  the query posed by the Member for Kampong Kembangan\r\n\r\nis  that  a  number  of bursaries  to  certain  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  students  have been cancelled.  We  provide\r\n\r\nbursaries to our students in order that they will  make\r\n\r\na  contribution to higher learning, higher  discipline,\r\n\r\nand  ultimately a higher level of economic activity  in\r\n\r\nour  country. But when students take advantage of these\r\n\r\nfacilities not in order to promote the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity but to bring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  disrepute the institutions of higher learning  to\r\n\r\nwhich they gain admission, then I think it is the  duty\r\n\r\nof the Government to terminate these bursaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I want to point out to Members generally that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  distinction between a scholarship  and  a\r\n\r\nbursary.  I have pointed out that the best of  all  the\r\n\r\nscholarships  which  we  give  are  now  known  as  the\r\n\r\nPresident's scholarships. A scholarship is  awarded  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of merit regardless of the financial standing\r\n\r\nof  the parents of the student. But if all students can\r\n\r\nget  assistance  only on the basis of  higher  academic\r\n\r\nperformance,  then a large body of very good  but  less\r\n\r\nthan   brilliant   students  would   be   denied   this\r\n\r\nopportunity. Therefore, a large number of students  are\r\n\r\ngiven  assistance by what are known as  bursaries.  For\r\n\r\nthe  award of a bursary, other considerations,  besides\r\n\r\njust academic competence, are taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  financial capacity of the parents  of  the\r\n\r\nstudent;  second, the subject which the student  wishes\r\n\r\nto  pursue.  If the subject is one which is  likely  to\r\n\r\nmake a contribution to our society, then a bursary will\r\n\r\nbe  more readily forthcoming. The amount of the bursary\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  student will depend upon the  financial\r\n\r\nresources  of his parents. The wealthier the parent  or\r\n\r\nthe more he can afford, the less the State will assist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Malay students, I would like to point out that\r\n\r\nwe  are  continuing our policy of giving free education\r\n\r\nfrom  primary  school to university  to  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  are Malays and can obtain  admission  to\r\n\r\nthese  institutions of learning. The reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nsum in no way affects the number of pupils who will  be\r\n\r\ngetting  scholarships or bursaries from Malay secondary\r\n\r\nschools to higher institutions of learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of giving the House some idea of the spread of\r\n\r\nthese  bursaries and scholarships, may I  just  briefly\r\n\r\ngive   the   round  total  figures  for   the   various\r\n\r\ninstitutions   for  this  year:  146  awards   to   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore, making a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntotal  of  472; 3 awards to the University  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nmaking  a  total  of 23; 77 awards to the  Polytechnic,\r\n\r\nmaking a total of 186; 97 awards to Nanyang University,\r\n\r\nmaking a total of 235; 10 to Ngee Ann College, making a\r\n\r\ntotal of 119; 40 to the Singapore Vocational Institute,\r\n\r\nmaking  a  total  of  59; 20 to the Teachers'  Training\r\n\r\nCollege,  making  a  total of 20 -  there  had  been  no\r\n\r\nprevious awards to the Teachers' Training College.

The  vacancy  was\r\n\r\ncirculated   to  the  Transport  Centre  and   District\r\n\r\nOffices. Amongst the applications was a casual labourer\r\n\r\nfrom  Katong  District.  He  was  interviewed  and   he\r\n\r\nsucceeded in getting the job. On Sunday, 27th November,\r\n\r\n1966,  he performed his normal duties as a labourer  in\r\n\r\nLorong  Melayu. A mandore handed him a note  requesting\r\n\r\nhim  to see the senior cleansing inspector, Mr  B.  D.\r\n\r\nRaj,  to  get  his appointment letter as a  driver.  He\r\n\r\ncomplied  with  the request.

Both Mr Raj and Mr Soo demanded a\r\n\r\ndeposit or an advance payment of $100 in order  to  get\r\n\r\nhis appointment as a driver confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not wish in any way to curb\r\n\r\nor restrict Members of this House from having their say\r\n\r\nduring  Budget time, but I must ask the Member who  has\r\n\r\nraised  this particular head for discussion to  confine\r\n\r\nhimself   to   the  policy  of  the  Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers.

I\r\n\r\nthink  I will now go on to the other point that I  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  make, and that is the policy of the  Attorney-General's Chambers to leave an officer in one post  for\r\n\r\na  considerable length of time without giving  him  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of a transfer to other posts in order to  gain\r\n\r\nexperience. And then when he comes up before the  Legal\r\n\r\nService Commission for consideration for promotion,  he\r\n\r\nwould  be  faced with the difficulty that  he  has  not\r\n\r\ngained  enough experience in other departments. Such  a\r\n\r\nhandicap  is not of his own making, and consequently  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Attorney-General's Chambers may do  well  to\r\n\r\nconsider amendments to this particular procedure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what has been\r\n\r\nstated  by  the  Member for Choa Chu  Kang  is  readily\r\n\r\naccepted,   that  is  to  say,  it  is  not  considered\r\n\r\nadvisable  to  leave  any  particular  officer  in  one\r\n\r\nposition  for too long a time. I think that  is  really\r\n\r\nwhat the Legal Service Commission would not like to  do\r\n\r\nin  regard  to the posting of officers. But  the  usual\r\n\r\nreason  is,  because of the exigencies  of  service,  a\r\n\r\nparticular officer is left in the said post much longer\r\n\r\nthan  is considered desirable. I should have said  that\r\n\r\nit  is the Attorney-General who is responsible for  the\r\n\r\npostings  of  legal officers and not the Legal  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.  I  hope  the  Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nappreciates  the  fact  that I am  trying  to  act  for\r\n\r\nanother Minister at a moment's notice, and therefore  I\r\n\r\nmay not be au fait with all the procedure. The postings\r\n\r\nand  transfers  of legal officers in the Legal  Service\r\n\r\nare  jointly the responsibility of the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nand  the  Chief  Justice  as Heads  of  the  Legal  and\r\n\r\nJudicial Branches respectively. I can assure the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Choa  Chu Kang that if a particular legal  officer\r\n\r\nhas  been  kept  in  a  position much  longer  than  is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  when it comes to the question of promotion,\r\n\r\nthis  will not be held against him because it  was  not\r\n\r\nwithin his control, and therefore adequate compensation\r\n\r\nwill be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade.

Unfortunately,  there\r\n\r\nare  still some Court interpreters, particularly in the\r\n\r\nCriminal and Traffic Courts, who are discharging  their\r\n\r\nduties  in a manner that was prevalent in the  colonial\r\n\r\ndays. More often than not, suspects and accused persons\r\n\r\nwho  are  brought up before the Magistrates either  for\r\n\r\ncriminal   or  traffic  offences,  often   find   great\r\n\r\ndifficulty   in  expressing  themselves  properly   and\r\n\r\nconfidently.  This is partly due to some of  the  Court\r\n\r\ninterpreters  who speak in aggressive and harsh  tones,\r\n\r\nthus  putting  fear and confusion into the  hearts  and\r\n\r\nminds  of the witnesses in the dock. This is considered\r\n\r\nhighly improper and unsatisfactory, especially now that\r\n\r\nwe  are  a  Socialist Government, and we should  in  no\r\n\r\ncircumstances let the public think that there are still\r\n\r\nsome civil servants who think highly of themselves  and\r\n\r\nact as if they are rulers. Suspects and accused persons\r\n\r\nwho are brought to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourt  on  trial should be allowed to speak freely  for\r\n\r\nthemselves through the Court interpreters and  let  the\r\n\r\nlaw   take  its  own  course.  In  fact,  these   Court\r\n\r\ninterpreters should feel that they are in the Courts to\r\n\r\ninterpret  and  serve the public and not  to  persecute\r\n\r\nthem.  We leave this to the D.P.P. In this manner,  the\r\n\r\npublic  will appreciate that they are well assisted  by\r\n\r\nthe interpreters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may the Minister in charge consider setting up a\r\n\r\nre-orientation course for all the Court interpreters so\r\n\r\nthat  they  may  give better service  and  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  their duties more efficiently to the  public\r\n\r\nand in a manner more befitting our Socialist society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Mountbatten has started off by paying  a\r\n\r\ntribute to the Court interpreters for their honesty and\r\n\r\nsincerity in the performance of their duties. His  long\r\n\r\ncomplaint  is  in respect of perhaps some  interpreters\r\n\r\nwho may be rude and discourteous to the public. I think\r\n\r\nit may be said that ever since 1959 - seven years ago -\r\n\r\nthere  has been a great improvement in the conduct  and\r\n\r\nbehaviour of our officials in Government service.  With\r\n\r\nthe establishment of a Central Complaints Bureau, it is\r\n\r\npossible,  if members of the public have any complaints\r\n\r\nabout   rude   behaviour  or  discourtesy   of   public\r\n\r\nofficials, for such cases to be investigated into.  And\r\n\r\nalso  the  fact  that Members of Parliament  have  been\r\n\r\ndutifully holding their Meet-the-people sessions  where\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public could lodge  their  complaints\r\n\r\npersonally   with   either   Members   of   Parliament,\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries and  Ministers.  Sir,  if  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the public really feels that  he  has  been\r\n\r\nunfairly  treated,  it  will  be  necessary  for   such\r\n\r\ncomplaints  to  be  lodged not  just  verbally  but  in\r\n\r\nwriting. As in the case of corrupt practices, there has\r\n\r\nalways  been the difficulty that members of the  public\r\n\r\nwill  just make verbal complaints and expect things  to\r\n\r\nbe followed up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to answer the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten that if there are any particular  cases  of\r\n\r\nrudeness  and  misbehaviour by public  officials,  such\r\n\r\nallegations   should  be  made  in  writing   and,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary,   the   Member   of   Parliament   for   the\r\n\r\nconstituency concerned would be good enough  to  report\r\n\r\nthese  cases  directly to the Minister for Finance  who\r\n\r\nis,  after  all, in charge of all Government  officials\r\n\r\nthroughout the State, or the Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\nThe  matter  could  then be taken  up  and,  after  due\r\n\r\ninvestigation, if an official is really  found  guilty,\r\n\r\nthen  disciplinary action will be taken. I do not think\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary to undergo what is  known  as  a  re-orientation  course  as suggested  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMountbatten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I shall report any complaints made\r\n\r\nto  me  during  my  next  Meet-the-people  session.

If they are Malaysian citizens,  I\r\n\r\ndo not see any reason why they should benefit from this\r\n\r\nsum when Singapore citizens should, by every right,  be\r\n\r\nentitled to benefit from the sum provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our citizens could easily replace the alien\r\n\r\ndomestic  staff.  May  I  know  whether  there  is  any\r\n\r\ncondition  or agreement whatsoever with regard  to  the\r\n\r\nemployment  of  Malaysian citizens  in  Temasek,  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it so happens\r\n\r\nthat  the staff employed by Temasek, Kuala Lumpur,  are\r\n\r\nMalaysian citizens because they had been employed there\r\n\r\nfor  several years even before we were in Malaysia.  It\r\n\r\nwas  found  more convenient to employ people  who  were\r\n\r\nalready,  so  to  speak, at hand, if  there  should  be\r\n\r\nfurther  expansion in the domestic staff  of  our  High\r\n\r\nCommission there, we shall bear in mind what  has  been\r\n\r\nsaid by the Member for Mountbatten and perhaps some  of\r\n\r\nour  own citizens can be posted for duty there.

I assume that the Prime  Minister  was\r\n\r\nasking  the workers not to ask for a bonus and  not  to\r\n\r\ngive  trouble  so that the company may have  confidence\r\n\r\nand  stable conditions to operate its buses. But I feel\r\n\r\nthat  this  confidence  is not  sufficient,  because  a\r\n\r\ngreater  part  of the confidence should come  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  by its making a clear policy on the  future\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the road transport system; otherwise  no\r\n\r\norganisations  will  put  in  any  capital  for  future\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the meeting of the Singapore Traction Company\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union, the Prime Minister also dwelt on  the\r\n\r\nunification of the road transport system. He said  that\r\n\r\nwe  could unify the road transport system in ten years,\r\n\r\nbut that we could not do it now, and that we must do it\r\n\r\nstep  by  step.  I fully agree with his statement.  But\r\n\r\nwhere do we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstart  from?  Which  step shall we  take?  If  we  take\r\n\r\npositive measures now to participate in the running  of\r\n\r\nthe  road transport system, we may achieve that  target\r\n\r\nwithin five to ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was some 10 years ago that the Report of the\r\n\r\nCommission   of  Inquiry  into  the  Public   Passenger\r\n\r\nTransport  System  made  certain  recommendations,  and\r\n\r\nunless  we take some positive measures, I do  not  feel\r\n\r\nthat in 10 years we can rectify our transport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, early this year the Managing\r\n\r\nDirector  of  the  Singapore Traction  Company  made  a\r\n\r\nstatement  in  the  Straits  Times  of  21st  February,\r\n\r\ndrawing  our  attention  to the threat  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\ntransport system. One of the reasons he put forward was\r\n\r\nthat  public transport was not functioning well because\r\n\r\nof  pirate taxis. He urged the Government to take  firm\r\n\r\naction   and  introduce  legislation  to  rectify   the\r\n\r\nsituation.  I  would say, Sir, that the  bus  companies\r\n\r\nthemselves  have a lot to be blamed for this  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs. During the good old days when they were making\r\n\r\nmoney,  some of the independent bus companies,  instead\r\n\r\nof   ploughing  their  profits  back  into  their  road\r\n\r\ntransport  system  to improve it, have  diverted  their\r\n\r\nprofits into building and development investments. As a\r\n\r\nresult,  when times are not so good and the  population\r\n\r\nexpands, we find that our road transport is inadequate.\r\n\r\nPirate  taxis thrive on this situation because the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies   are   unable  to   satisfy   the   public's\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the responsibility of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  ensure that there is  in  operation  an\r\n\r\nefficient and economical transport system. I feel it is\r\n\r\nits duty to participate in this public utility which, I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  is  the only utility still left,  except  for\r\n\r\nlicensing, in the hands of private enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Managing Director of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Traction Company raised his complaints in the\r\n\r\nStraits Times, the then Permanent Secretary attached to\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister's Office, Mr S. T. Stewart,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreplied  in the Straits Tunes of 24th February  to  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  He  suggested a  pooling  arrangement,  as\r\n\r\npractised  by  the airlines, for the bus  companies.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  a  meeting was initiated by  the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for  the  Prime  Minister's Department  in   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Law's Conference Room on 11th March, 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, under Standing Order 43 you\r\n\r\nhave about two minutes more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I think the House would like to\r\n\r\nknow   from   the  Minister  of  State  what   happened\r\n\r\nsubsequent  to  that meeting. As time is  running  out,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  will only say this. Yesterday, the Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa   Chu   Kang  was  advocating  nationalising   the\r\n\r\ntransport industry. I am not supporting his suggestion,\r\n\r\nbut I would call upon the Government to participate  in\r\n\r\nthe  running  of  the  road transport  system,  because\r\n\r\nwithout  its participation, it is not possible  to  get\r\n\r\nthe independent bus companies together. I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat the nucleus of this participation should come from\r\n\r\nthe Traction Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish to\r\n\r\nassociate myself with the sentiments expressed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for River Valley on the subject. Not only  that,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  the Registrar of Vehicles should  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  adequate  buses be supplied for  any  new  route\r\n\r\ngranted  to a bus company in Singapore. Some  of  these\r\n\r\nbus  companies, after having been granted a new  route,\r\n\r\ncannot  provide adequate buses to meet the requirements\r\n\r\nof  the  Registrar.  As an example,  Mr  Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar issued a licence to Route Service No. 12  and\r\n\r\nRoute  Service No. 12A. The company which  was  granted\r\n\r\nthe  licence took away some of the buses from Route No.\r\n\r\n12 and placed them on Route No. 12A. Naturally the bus\r\n\r\nservice  on Route No. 12 becomes inadequate. This  will\r\n\r\nencourage  members of the public to make use of  pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a bus company has an adequate fleet of buses at its\r\n\r\ndisposal,  complaints by it against pirate  taxis  will\r\n\r\nnot  arise. If it cannot offer an adequate bus  service\r\n\r\nthere will be a long waiting interval for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassengers  who will naturally complain  about  it.  So\r\n\r\nthey  will make use of any kind of transport. If  there\r\n\r\nare  pirate  taxis,  they will use them.  I  hope,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  that there will be ways and means to regulate\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of bus routes to bus companies  and  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  such  companies will be able to  supply  adequate\r\n\r\nbuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see that the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member for River Valley does not support my  idea\r\n\r\nof  nationalising the public transport system. He wants\r\n\r\nthe  Government to participate financially, I  suppose.\r\n\r\nBut I wonder what his ideas are about participation. Is\r\n\r\nhe  thinking that Government should just go in and have\r\n\r\na   financial  share  in  the  bus  companies   without\r\n\r\nachieving  a  major  degree of shareholding  so  as  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  policy of bus companies  and  also  their\r\n\r\ngeneral running?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley has also said that the\r\n\r\npublic  bus  transport system is, in fact, one  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  utilities. If he is of that opinion, why should\r\n\r\nhe  be so afraid of the idea of Government taking  over\r\n\r\nthe  running  of  the  system  altogether?  To  have  a\r\n\r\nrational traffic system, I think the whole question  of\r\n\r\nroads  and  transport system must be  looked  at  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole. We cannot just resolve the traffic problem today\r\n\r\nwithout  looking  into  the  whole  system  of   public\r\n\r\ntransport  vis-a-vis  private cars.  For  example,  our\r\n\r\nroads are now chock-full of private cars and the number\r\n\r\nof cars is on the increase day by day. We are now doing\r\n\r\nour  utmost to solve this road traffic problem,  but  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the  attempts  are  somewhat  ad  hoc   and\r\n\r\npiecemeal and there is no overall planning to solve it.\r\n\r\nI  think  that  the  public transport  system  and  the\r\n\r\ntraffic problem must be looked at as a whole. In  order\r\n\r\nto  solve  the traffic problem, we may have to  have  a\r\n\r\nmore rational public transport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether what I am going to say is far too\r\n\r\nbold  for  the  liking of the Government. For  example,\r\n\r\npossibly we can exclude private vehicles from the  city\r\n\r\ncentre.  But this cannot be done without our having  an\r\n\r\nefficient and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrational  public transport system, because  if  private\r\n\r\ncars  are excluded from the city centre, there must  be\r\n\r\nsome other means of transport to convey workers to work\r\n\r\nand back to their homes. I, therefore, recommend to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that while the public transport  system  at\r\n\r\npresent  is a problem, they should not look  at  it  in\r\n\r\nisolation but should consider it in connection with the\r\n\r\nwhole system of vehicular transport in the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I wish to thank  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament for showing an interest  in  the\r\n\r\nproblem of public transport in our State. We admit that\r\n\r\nit  is  a complicated one. Several things have happened\r\n\r\nsince  this Department was put under the charge of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government over a period of two  years.  After\r\n\r\none  year  of independence, several transport  problems\r\n\r\nhave  emerged.  For  that reason,  we  have  set  up  a\r\n\r\ncommittee,  headed  by Mr Milton Tan,  to  tackle  the\r\n\r\ntransport  problem.  Unfortunately,  we  did  not   see\r\n\r\nMembers appearing to give representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar drew my attention to the\r\n\r\nS.T.C. and other bus companies. I feel that this  is  a\r\n\r\ncomplicated matter, because it involves legislation and\r\n\r\nalso finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to uniform legislation, there are at\r\n\r\npresent  two  main  sets of legislation  governing  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  bus  companies.  One  is  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction  Company Ordinance, and the other is the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Ordinance,  under  which  the  other  10   bus\r\n\r\ncompanies operate. Hence, a committee has been  set  up\r\n\r\nto  consider proposals for uniform legislation for  the\r\n\r\nbus  companies in Singapore. As I have said earlier on,\r\n\r\nthe  implications involve legal and financial problems.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it will necessarily take some  time  before\r\n\r\nany concrete proposals can be put forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the pooling of the bus services\r\n\r\nreferred  to just now by the Member for River Valley - I\r\n\r\nam  referring to the pooling of services of the  S.T.C.\r\n\r\nand other bus companies  which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  requested  - tentative proposals  have  been\r\n\r\nsubmitted.  A  committee has been set  up  by  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies. These proposals for the pooling of  services\r\n\r\nare  being  studied by the Omnibus Licensing  Authority\r\n\r\nand  the  Registrar of Vehicles. It means,  in  effect,\r\n\r\nthat my Ministry is taking active steps to resolve this\r\n\r\ncomplicated problem of our public transport  system.  I\r\n\r\nwish to be frank with hon. Members who have an interest\r\n\r\nin  this  matter.  My Ministry is prepared  to  receive\r\n\r\nconstructive criticisms, as a result of which  we  will\r\n\r\nbe  in  a  better position to resolve this  problem.  I\r\n\r\nwelcome  at  any  time  constructive  suggestions   and\r\n\r\ncriticisms  from  Members who  are  familiar  with  the\r\n\r\ntransport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I just want to say that the\r\n\r\nMinister of State has not touched upon the Traffic Unit\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  set  up  in the Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  to look into the question  of  traffic  in\r\n\r\nSingapore as a whole. He has not replied to my  general\r\n\r\nquestion,  that is, Government should not consider  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  public transport in isolation, but  should\r\n\r\nconsider  the  question  of vehicular  traffic  in  the\r\n\r\nisland  as  a  whole. At present, it would appear  that\r\n\r\nthis  Traffic Unit that has been set up is bogged  down\r\n\r\nwith  details  and  that it is just  tinkering  with  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  of  diversion here and an overhead  bridge\r\n\r\nthere  without  going  into  the  whole  problem  of  a\r\n\r\nrationalised system of vehicular traffic in the  island\r\n\r\nas  a  whole. I see that they are cutting away half  of\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road  Circus - in fact, cutting down  all  the\r\n\r\ngreens  now.  This may be able to relieve  the  traffic\r\n\r\nalong  Orchard  Road, but it does not solve  the  basic\r\n\r\nproblem of vehicular traffic in Singapore as a whole. I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Government to look into this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, may I supplement what\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State has said in reply to the Members\r\n\r\nwho  have  raised  the question of the desirability  of\r\n\r\nnationalising  bus  transport?  The  Member  for  River\r\n\r\nValley thought that the Government should be courageous\r\n\r\nenough to embark upon such a venture. I would only  say\r\n\r\nthat in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nembarking upon a new enterprise, it is not courage that\r\n\r\nis  wanted. I would say it is wisdom that is  necessary\r\n\r\nin  considering  this  problem,  and  where  wisdom  is\r\n\r\nlacking, courage becomes foolhardiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has stated very clearly indeed that civil servants are incapable of running a business enterprise, much less a bus company - whether it be a statutory company or an organisation directly run by the Government. I fully share the misgivings of the Minister for Finance that in nationalising bus\r\n\r\norganisations,  far from bringing in more  revenue  for\r\n\r\nthe  coffers of the Treasury, the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\ninstead  would have to subsidise bus transport  on  the\r\n\r\nisland.  However, I do not consider that  by  having  a\r\n\r\nunified   bus   service  there  is  going   to   be   a\r\n\r\nrationalisation of transport. No one can say  that  the\r\n\r\nbus  transport  service  in Singapore  is  adequate  or\r\n\r\nefficient. Although we have 15 bus companies, I do  not\r\n\r\nsee  how, by having only one bus company in the future,\r\n\r\nit  will  make the bus service more efficient.  It  may\r\n\r\nwell  be that it would be desirable for users of  buses\r\n\r\nto  have  perhaps integrated bus routes  which  can  be\r\n\r\noperated  by fewer bus companies. Instead of having  15\r\n\r\nbus  companies now, we can perhaps persuade some of the\r\n\r\nsmaller bus companies to amalgamate and thereby  assist\r\n\r\nthe  Road Licensing Authority, which is responsible for\r\n\r\nallocating  bus  routes  to the companies.  This  will,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  make  it easier for anyone  who  wishes  to\r\n\r\ntravel from one part of the island to the other without\r\n\r\nhaving to change buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at present making a study of a new Bus\r\n\r\nLicensing Bill which will apply not only to the  S.T.C.\r\n\r\nbut also to the Chinese bus companies. It is true there\r\n\r\nare   today  two  separate  Ordinances  governing   the\r\n\r\noperation of the S.T.C. and the other bus companies. We\r\n\r\nhave  in our studies come across problems which involve\r\n\r\nmatters  of  finance-  not only  finance  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nroyalties  and taxation which affect the Treasury,  but\r\n\r\nalso   the   financial  operations  of  the   companies\r\n\r\nthemselves. It will take some time before we receive  a\r\n\r\nfinal draft of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  Bill.  But when it happens, we also propose  that\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  smaller companies should amalgamate,  as\r\n\r\nthis will help the Road Licensing Authority to allocate\r\n\r\nroutes  which  will be more to the convenience  of  the\r\n\r\ntravelling public than to the bus companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my discussions with bus officials, I have explained\r\n\r\nto  them the necessity of expanding their services  and\r\n\r\nploughing  their profits back into the operation.  Some\r\n\r\nof  the bus companies, far from using their profits  to\r\n\r\nimprove  their  bus  operations,  have  used  them   in\r\n\r\nbuilding  houses, investing in real estate, or  delving\r\n\r\ninto  other types of business. While we do not  prevent\r\n\r\nbus  companies  from participating  in  other  business\r\n\r\nventures,  we must at the same time impress  upon  them\r\n\r\nthat  their first responsibility surely must be to have\r\n\r\na  more efficient organisation of their bus operations.\r\n\r\nMore  recently,  the  Singapore Traction  Company  have\r\n\r\nnotified  us that they plan to purchase 100  new  buses\r\n\r\nfor  operation  on the routes, and we  have  encouraged\r\n\r\nthem  to  do so. I see no purpose in allowing a company\r\n\r\nto  run  an  inefficient bus service along  the  routes\r\n\r\nwhich have been allocated to it. It must be prepared to\r\n\r\nexpand and improve its organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a point which the Road Licensing Authority\r\n\r\nwill  be looking into. We would like to remind all  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  of  the  rule that all licences  to  operate\r\n\r\nroutes  hold good only for one year. All these licences\r\n\r\nmust   be  renewed,  and  if  we  should  come   across\r\n\r\ncomplaints  or  come  across in our own  investigations\r\n\r\nthat certain companies are not operating certain routes\r\n\r\nas   efficiently  as  they  ought  to,  then  the  Road\r\n\r\nLicensing  Authority  will be  asked  to  repeal  these\r\n\r\nlicences  and  give  them to some other  bus  companies\r\n\r\nwhich are prepared to expand their organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang that perhaps the central area of the city  be\r\n\r\nforbidden  to all private car owners, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsay  that all car owners, in the first instance, do not\r\n\r\ntravel in buses. The fact that you have so many cars in\r\n\r\nSingapore is surely a reflection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the affluence of the people and that the population\r\n\r\nis  fast becoming a middle-class population. It is  not\r\n\r\nonly  the car owners who would rather prefer to  travel\r\n\r\nby themselves rather than going in buses, but there are\r\n\r\nalso those who use motor scooters and motor cycles  who\r\n\r\nwould rather use their own vehicles than buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I agree that a long-term approach to the\r\n\r\nproblem of public transport is very necessary. The Hill\r\n\r\nReport,  which  has been mentioned by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley,  is  to a certain extent  out  of  date.\r\n\r\nBriefly, it recommends that the Government should  take\r\n\r\nover   all  public  transportation.  But  we  have   to\r\n\r\ncompromise  between  what  is  practical  and  what  is\r\n\r\nwanted.  If the economics warrant it, then I would  say\r\n\r\nthe  other  best form of transport we can  have  is  an\r\n\r\nunderground subway system, such as you have in the  big\r\n\r\ncapitals  of  the  world. This  certainly  will  remove\r\n\r\ncongestion  from  the  streets.  More  people  will  go\r\n\r\nunderground and there will be no necessity to take your\r\n\r\ncar  from your house to the centre of the city when you\r\n\r\ngo   to  work.  But,  at  the  same  time,  subways  or\r\n\r\nunderground trains can supplement overhead traffic.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance is prepared to put money into\r\n\r\nsuch  a  venture,  I  am only too happy  to  go  around\r\n\r\nlooking for people who will want to co-operate with the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in building an underground system.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nwe  could  do it on a 49-51 per cent basis, or whatever\r\n\r\nother  percentage basis is preferred. It finally  boils\r\n\r\ndown  to the simple fact whether the Treasury can stand\r\n\r\nthe  load  of  investing very heavily in a new  venture\r\n\r\nwhich is not certain to bring profit or revenue to  its\r\n\r\ncoffers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Unit which the Member for Choa Chu Kang\r\n\r\nhas   mentioned   is  located  in  the   Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment. Its primary job really is to study the flow\r\n\r\nof  traffic in the main roads of Singapore and  thereby\r\n\r\nhelp  plan  how such roads can be widened or new  roads\r\n\r\ncan  be built so that the flow of traffic can be evenly\r\n\r\ndistributed throughout the streets of Singapore  rather\r\n\r\nthan that all traffic be concentrated along a few major\r\n\r\nroads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Just to sum up, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I will only say that it is our hope that the  bus\r\n\r\nworkers    will   understand   that   unification    or\r\n\r\nrationalisation    of   bus   transport    simply    by\r\n\r\nnationalisation  does not solve the problem  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport  at  all.  It is up to  the  workers  in  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies   to  ensure  that  their  companies   remain\r\n\r\nfinancially  viable,  because if  a  company  keeps  on\r\n\r\nlosing a million dollars every year, then there  is  no\r\n\r\nalternative but for it to close down. That, of  course,\r\n\r\nwill   not  be  to  the  benefit  of  the  bus  workers\r\n\r\nthemselves. I can also add a note of warning, that if a\r\n\r\ncompany  were to close down, the Government  would  not\r\n\r\njust  step  in  and  say. \"We will take  over  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompany.\"  So please understand that however  much  the\r\n\r\nbus  workers' unions want the Government to  take  over\r\n\r\nbus transport, we cannot promise them that we are going\r\n\r\nto  do  so.  Therefore, it is in their own interest  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  bus  companies in which they are  working  a\r\n\r\ngoing concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Our jet  planes  are\r\n\r\nable  to  travel  beyond  the  speed  of  sound  -   at\r\n\r\nsupersonic  speed.  This  is  especially  important  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  which is situated at the hub  of  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia and the cross-roads of Asia and Europe. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe    system    of   transportation   should    attain\r\n\r\ninternational   standards.  Our  Paya  Lebar   Airport,\r\n\r\ncompared   with  airport  facilities  in  other   Asian\r\n\r\ncountries, is quite up to the standard.

The  first  is  the\r\n\r\nstranglehold on the economy of Singapore that is  being\r\n\r\nexercised by the Shipping Freight Conference. I am glad\r\n\r\nthat this point was answered by the Finance Minister in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  debate yesterday.

I shall\r\n\r\nframe what I want to say in the form of a question, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I wish to ask the Minister in charge  of\r\n\r\nMarine  whether  he  has any proposal  to  replace  the\r\n\r\npresent expatriate personnel by Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It  does  not  come  under   my\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Nevertheless, I personally do  take  a  keen\r\n\r\ninterest  in  this matter. I think it is  inappropriate\r\n\r\nindeed to discuss Conference rates under this Head 0302\r\n\r\n--- Marine, which is solely responsible for running the\r\n\r\nmotor launches and the lighthouses in Singapore waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point raised by the Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang  as to whether or not the expatriate posts in  the\r\n\r\nMarine  Department will be Singaporeanised, I say  that\r\n\r\nif  we  can  find  local citizens  with  the  necessary\r\n\r\nqualifications, we will be only too happy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  employ them when the expatriates retire.  The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  should  realise that to obtain a  Foreign-going\r\n\r\nMaster's  Certificate  requires  a  lengthy  period  of\r\n\r\ntraining and sitting for examinations which take almost\r\n\r\nas long as six years. Since 1959, we have made positive\r\n\r\nefforts to encourage local officers to take this higher\r\n\r\nsea-going  examination. In fact, there  are  two  local\r\n\r\ncitizens  who are officers in the Marine Department.  I\r\n\r\npresume  that in the course of time, when the contracts\r\n\r\nof  the  expatriates expire, these officers  will  take\r\n\r\nover  the  duties  which  are now  being  performed  by\r\n\r\nexpatriate personnel. However, until I am assured  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  enough  local people with such qualifications\r\n\r\nwho can fill the places, I think the best policy is  to\r\n\r\nutilise the services of expatriates wherever we can get\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe in Singaporeanisation simply for the\r\n\r\nsake  of  Singaporeanisation, because in our experience\r\n\r\nwe  have  found  sometimes - it is sad to  say  -  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeanisation has not brought about more efficient\r\n\r\nor  improved  services  and administration.  Experience\r\n\r\nsometimes  is  lacking  and,  therefore,  we  have   to\r\n\r\napproach    the    problem    rather    conservatively,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in technical departments  which  find  it\r\n\r\nvery  difficult indeed to recruit local  citizens  with\r\n\r\nthe essential technical qualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polytechnic Nautical Department has started pre-sea training courses and is arranging opportunities for\r\n\r\nstudents  who finish this course to work on board  ship\r\n\r\nso that eventually they will be able to work towards  a\r\n\r\nMate   Certificate,  and  ultimately  a   Foreign-going\r\n\r\nMaster's Certificate. But all this training takes time,\r\n\r\nand  it  does  not  mean that a man  who  has  recently\r\n\r\nacquired  any certificate should therefore be the  head\r\n\r\nof  a department. It will indeed be a very foolish  and\r\n\r\nshort-sighted   policy  to  believe   that   the   mere\r\n\r\nacquisition of a certificate alone entitles  any  local\r\n\r\ncitizen to be the head of a department. He still has to\r\n\r\nwork  his  way  up  in  the  department,  acquire   the\r\n\r\nnecessary experience administratively or otherwise, and\r\n\r\nhope eventually in the course of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime to be promoted when a vacancy occurs. Up to today,\r\n\r\nI  am  satisfied that the policy of gradually replacing\r\n\r\nexpatriate  personnel  in  the  Marine  Department   is\r\n\r\nworking according to schedule, although I must publicly\r\n\r\nsay  I regret very much indeed that local citizens  who\r\n\r\nmay possess the necessary qualifications have been very\r\n\r\nslow  in  coming forward or reluctant to  work  in  the\r\n\r\nMarine  Department. On the other hand, they  prefer  to\r\n\r\nwork on board ship as Masters of vessels simply because\r\n\r\nthey  can  earn  a  better  salary  than  they  can  in\r\n\r\nGovernment service. This is the problem we face.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think any local personnel in the department in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry grudge the presence of any expatriates we have\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister's explanation, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,609,230 for Head 0302 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0304 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0304 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead 1187.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving this amendment, I wish to\r\n\r\ndraw  the Deputy Prime Minister's attention, if  he  is\r\n\r\nnot aware of it, to the growing dissatisfaction and low\r\n\r\nmorale of the police constables at the Airport Security\r\n\r\nSection. I believe this affects the discipline  of  the\r\n\r\nforce in security work in an area like the Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for their dissatisfaction was brought about\r\n\r\nby  the  difference  in  the salary  scales  which  the\r\n\r\nregular force of the Polis Republik Singapura enjoy and\r\n\r\nthe  salary scale which the Airport security constables\r\n\r\nreceive. Before Malaysia, the police constables at  the\r\n\r\nAirport  and the Regular Police Force were on the  same\r\n\r\nsalary  scales.  They  were  recruited  with  the  same\r\n\r\nqualifications and they performed similar  duties.  The\r\n\r\nchange  in  the salary scales during the Malaysia  days\r\n\r\nwas the result of representations made by the regular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolice  force to the Salaries Commission then in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.  However, when the recommendations  were  made,\r\n\r\nthe  Airport police force was omitted from enjoying the\r\n\r\nsame scheme. I understand that the position now is that\r\n\r\na  fresh  submission  has been  made  to  the  Salaries\r\n\r\nCommission which is now sitting in Singapore.

They are being asked to pay a deposit of  $500.\r\n\r\nThere  are cases where sponsors arrange for the  visits\r\n\r\nof their relatives or friends, and they usually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nget  a return ticket. Since that is the position,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhy  should  an  additional deposit be asked  for  from\r\n\r\nthese people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we all\r\n\r\nknow that the bulk of the citizens of this Republic are\r\n\r\nmade  up  of immigrants from China and India, who  have\r\n\r\nbeen here for many generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Republic has now taken measures to\r\n\r\ndistinguish  between those who are citizens  and  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  non-citizens. The rightful  citizen  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry   is   a   citizen   by   birth,   descent   or\r\n\r\nnaturalisation,  and he is issued with  a  plastic  red\r\n\r\nidentity  card. The non-citizen is issued with  a  blue\r\n\r\ncard.  Although  the Government has  tightened  up  its\r\n\r\nCitizenship   Rules,   in  1957  all   immigrants   and\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  citizens who wanted to take up  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship were given the opportunity to do  so.  Some\r\n\r\nprogressive-minded people, through long  residence  and\r\n\r\nassociation  with  this country, were  quite  ready  to\r\n\r\nidentify  themselves with the destiny of  this  country\r\n\r\nand  have taken up Singapore citizenship. These  people\r\n\r\nnow  possess  the  red identity cards.  Some  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  this category, and if  I  may  be  a  bit\r\n\r\npersonal, some Indian immigrants of this category,  for\r\n\r\nreasons  best  known to themselves, were  not  able  to\r\n\r\nassociate with their families for more than five  years\r\n\r\nat  any one time. It may be that before that period  or\r\n\r\nafter,  they had got their citizenship. The Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  now  promulgated  a  rule   that   any\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen who is separated from his family  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  five  years cannot bring  his  family  into\r\n\r\nSingapore. In other words, an entry permit will not  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  such  families.  So  in  certain  cases  the\r\n\r\nfamilies  of  such  persons were  allowed  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  visit passes for a six-month  period.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that even this is now being denied  them  by\r\n\r\nthe Immigration Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the Deputy Prime Minister that if these\r\n\r\nfamilies  could not be permitted to come to  Singapore\r\n\r\non a permanent basis, then at least facilities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be  made to allow them to come to Singapore  on\r\n\r\nvisit passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which my colleagues spoke on was\r\n\r\ndeposits. Singapore citizens applying for visit  passes\r\n\r\neither  for  their  wives,  children  or  parents   are\r\n\r\nrequired to pay a security deposit of $500, in addition\r\n\r\nto  producing a receipt for the return ticket which has\r\n\r\nbeen  booked with a shipping company. I wish to suggest\r\n\r\nto  the  Deputy  Prime Minister that  once  the  proper\r\n\r\nreceipt  for  a booking return ticket with  a  shipping\r\n\r\ncompany  is produced, the security deposit of $500  may\r\n\r\nbe waived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\na  case also with regard to immigration. He is a  voter\r\n\r\nwho  stays in my constituency. By occupation, he  is  a\r\n\r\npilot  employed by the Port of Singapore Authority.  He\r\n\r\nhas  an  aged mother who lives in Cambodia. This  pilot\r\n\r\nwas   about  to  get  married.  According  to   Chinese\r\n\r\ntradition  and custom, parents always like  to  witness\r\n\r\nthe  wedding of their children. In this case, this  man\r\n\r\nhad  applied  to  the Immigration Department  for  some\r\n\r\nmonths, not to get this old lady to come here and stay,\r\n\r\nbut  just to witness the occasion of his wedding. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know why his application was rejected. He came and\r\n\r\nsaw  me  and I then explained his case to the  official\r\n\r\nconcerned  but  still this official refused  to  agree.\r\n\r\nFinally  -  I  do  not  know  through  whose  help   or\r\n\r\nassistance  -  his  mother  was  allowed  to  come   to\r\n\r\nSingapore after the wedding was over. But the  son  who\r\n\r\nsponsored her entry into Singapore was asked to  pay  a\r\n\r\ndeposit of $2,000 in spite of the fact that the  return\r\n\r\npassage  and everything else was provided for.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat   in   the  case  of  social  visits  by  parents,\r\n\r\nparticularly  to witness their children's  weddings  as\r\n\r\nthe  case  may  be,  the  authorities  should  be  more\r\n\r\nsympathetic.  I  bring this matter  before  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and shall be very grateful if  he  will\r\n\r\ninvestigate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To answer the first query whether\r\n\r\nthe  Controller  of Immigration is an  expatriate.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  to my recollection, I believe that  he  is  a\r\n\r\nlocal citizen and he is not under contract. I have  not\r\n\r\nbothered to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  antecedents of civil  servants  in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry.  But this is the first time that I have  been\r\n\r\nqueried  whether  the Controller of Immigration  is  an\r\n\r\nexpatriate.  However,  I shall  return  and  check  the\r\n\r\nfacts,  but I believe he is not. [Interruption]  No.  I\r\n\r\nthink  you had better make it quite clear. I was  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  he is an expatriate or not. My answer is  that\r\n\r\nhe is not an expatriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the general question of applications for a visit to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I want to make it quite clear that  Members\r\n\r\nof  the  House  should  be able to distinguish  between\r\n\r\nthose who wish to come to Singapore to settle down, and\r\n\r\nthose  who wish to come to Singapore on a social  visit\r\n\r\npass.  As  far as those who propose to settle  down  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are concerned, the rule is that citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore should not be separated from their  wives  or\r\n\r\ntheir husbands for more than five years. Otherwise, the\r\n\r\nproof  that the man or the woman still has an  interest\r\n\r\nin  the  other  half does not exist.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nchildren,  everyone  knows  that  children  who  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed are to be brought into Singapore should not be\r\n\r\nabove  six years old, and for aged parents they  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  more than 65 years old. So I do not  want  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  admission into Singapore to be  mixed  up\r\n\r\nwith applications for social visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as applications for permanent entry into\r\n\r\nSingapore  are concerned, they deal with the  immediate\r\n\r\nrelatives of the applicant. You cannot say just because\r\n\r\nyou  are a Singapore citizen, you want to apply for the\r\n\r\npermanent  entry  into Singapore of  your  uncle,  your\r\n\r\nbrother, or your auntie or your sister-in-law. This  is\r\n\r\nthe present regulation which we intend to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of whether or not a\r\n\r\ndeposit  is necessary from those who come to  Singapore\r\n\r\non  a  social visit pass, I am in favour that a deposit\r\n\r\nshould  be asked for, because the money is not retained\r\n\r\nby  the  Singapore Government but is  returned  to  the\r\n\r\nvisitor when he leaves the island. The sum of money  is\r\n\r\nto  ensure that if the man over-stays his visit, and he\r\n\r\nmight be kept by the Government, then this sum of money\r\n\r\ncan be used. Or in other cases,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe money would be used to repatriate those persons who\r\n\r\nhave  come  to Singapore for a period longer  than  was\r\n\r\nintended.  However, what we can do  is  to  adjust  the\r\n\r\nquantum of the deposit. This is the first time  it  has\r\n\r\ncome  to my knowledge that a deposit of $2,000 had been\r\n\r\nasked  for  from this particular lady from Cambodia.  I\r\n\r\ncan  recollect very faintly that I did receive a letter\r\n\r\nfrom somebody about the application by this lady for  a\r\n\r\nsocial  visit  pass, and it was I who agreed  that  she\r\n\r\nshould  be allowed to come to Singapore. But I did  not\r\n\r\nknow  that the Controller of immigration had  asked  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  $2,000 for a deposit. If that is so,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink  perhaps  he  has not been so  judicious  in  his\r\n\r\ndecision. This is a matter which I hope I will be  able\r\n\r\nto take up with the Immigration officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Members will understand that the question of\r\n\r\nimmigration is a general problem. It is very  difficult\r\n\r\nindeed for the Immigration Department to keep track  of\r\n\r\nall those who come to Singapore. There is no preventive\r\n\r\nbranch  of  the  Immigration Department  to  visit  the\r\n\r\naddresses given by those who have entered Singapore and\r\n\r\nascertain  whether  they  have  overstayed  the  period\r\n\r\nallowed  to them, or whether they have disappeared.  In\r\n\r\nthe  experience  of  the Immigration  Department,  some\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens have successfully applied for social\r\n\r\nvisit  passes for their friends and relatives  and,  in\r\n\r\nmany  cases, the Department has not been able  to  find\r\n\r\nout  whether such persons have left the island or  not.\r\n\r\nOn  investigation sometimes it has been found that such\r\n\r\npeople  have  conveniently disappeared. If  we  are  in\r\n\r\nearnest   to  contain  the  growth  of  population   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  must also be determined to  prevent  an\r\n\r\nuncontrollable influx of foreign immigrants. Some  come\r\n\r\nin  illegally. Some come in legally. But  whatever  way\r\n\r\nthey  choose to come in, we must ensure that those  who\r\n\r\ncome  in  are  those  who are going to  bring  economic\r\n\r\nbenefits   to  Singapore.  Also  our  citizens   should\r\n\r\ncomprehend that the limitations of the State itself  do\r\n\r\nnot  warrant an unrestricted flow of visitors,  whether\r\n\r\nit  be for three or six months, for this flow cannot be\r\n\r\nfully controlled. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  the Immigration Department is transferred to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Interior and  Defence  as  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  next year, we hope that with the collaboration\r\n\r\nof the police, the Immigration Department would be able\r\n\r\nto develop more effective measures to ascertain whether\r\n\r\nvisitors  to  Singapore, be it on a professional  visit\r\n\r\npass  or  social visit pass, or an employment pass,  do\r\n\r\nnot overstay the periods that they have been given, and\r\n\r\nso  there  is  some check on the population  growth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Members  of  this House,  of  course,  will\r\n\r\nsympathise  with  the  Immigration  Department  on  the\r\n\r\nproblem, but if there are specific instances where they\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  their constituents have not  been  given\r\n\r\njustice, then they could write to me until the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe  year, or they could write to the Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nInterior  and Defence from next year onwards  and  give\r\n\r\nhim   specific  instances  where  they  can  truthfully\r\n\r\nsupport  the  applications for a social visit  pass  or\r\n\r\npermanent entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like Members of the House to know clearly\r\n\r\nthat  applications for permanent entry  are  applicable\r\n\r\nonly   to  certain  categories  of  persons  -   wives,\r\n\r\nchildren,  parents.  All  others  who  wish  to   visit\r\n\r\nSingapore must do so on a social visit pass, unless, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there are special circumstances which  warrant\r\n\r\nthe   permanent  entry  of  such  persons.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nindicated,   persons  who  can  help  our   plans   for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation or who can bring economic benefits to\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  who can bring in expertise or  technical\r\n\r\nskill one way or the other, such persons surely can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered for permanent entry. But I do not  think  we\r\n\r\ncan   allow  any  other  person  to  come  freely  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr S.

In the case of Singapore, in\r\n\r\nso  far  as entry permits are concerned, I think  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  certain  regulations to restrict  unskilled\r\n\r\npersons    from   coming   here   too   easily.    But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, Mr Speaker, the immigration authorities\r\n\r\nin  their  administration seem  to  have  approved  the\r\n\r\npermanent  stay of one expatriate person,  and  allowed\r\n\r\nhim  to work here. This is the case of a person who has\r\n\r\ncome  from  the  other  side of the  world.  He  is  an\r\n\r\nunskilled  person but he has been allowed to stay  here\r\n\r\npermanently to work in Pan-American Airways. Under  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, if we review the position, there may  be\r\n\r\nmany   other   departments  involved,  not   just   the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department alone. But it is the immigration\r\n\r\nauthorities  which  first  opened  the  door  to   this\r\n\r\nforeigner  to  come in. As a result, the  situation  is\r\n\r\nbeyond redemption. Sir, we must pay attention to  cases\r\n\r\nlike this as we march forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as foreign affairs are concerned, we are non-aligned and neutral. If in our administration we have\r\n\r\ncertain  defects  which  can  be  exploited  by  anti-nationals to accuse us of not strictly implementing our\r\n\r\nnon-aligned policy, then the situation will be  rather\r\n\r\nbad,  particularly  in the case of non-skilled  persons\r\n\r\ncoming here. We must consider that there are more than\r\n\r\n60,000  persons registered with the Employment Exchange\r\n\r\nhere. If these people see unskilled persons coming here\r\n\r\nand seeking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployment at their expense, then they will be  looking\r\n\r\nat  the  foreigners with much distress in  their  eyes.\r\n\r\nSir,  if  this  problem  is not  properly  treated  and\r\n\r\nhandled, then I am afraid that the people at large  may\r\n\r\nnot have much confidence in our immigration policy,  or\r\n\r\nour  non-aligned  policy. There may  be  some  possible\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding in this respect. So unless there is  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  explanation, I would say that  since  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  authorities made a mistake by opening  the\r\n\r\ndoor to a foreigner to come in, then it should be their\r\n\r\nresponsibility to send him back to where he came  from.\r\n\r\nI  think we must make good use of the repatriation vote\r\n\r\nin  this  case.  But  I doubt whether  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nauthorities will be able to make good use of  this  sum\r\n\r\nof  $14,880, because it is a vote for repatriation  and\r\n\r\nother  expenses. I have no confidence  in  the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich they are making use of this vote. So I would like\r\n\r\nto  reduce  it  by $10 so that we do not  waste  public\r\n\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just wish to\r\n\r\nask  the Deputy Prime Minister how is it that, in spite\r\n\r\nof  the  fact that the Immigration Department is asking\r\n\r\nfor  a deposit in respect of all people who come in  on\r\n\r\nvisit  passes - in fact, in a particular case,  as  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister has said, the Controller had been\r\n\r\ninjudicious in asking for too huge an amount - we still\r\n\r\nhave  to  make  provision to the  tune  of  $14,000  in\r\n\r\nrespect   of   Maintenance,  Removal  and  Repatriation\r\n\r\nExpenses?

If we wish Singapore to develop\r\n\r\neconomically, we must be generous at times and  realise\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore today is what it is on  account  of  an\r\n\r\nimmigrant  population and also on account of  expertise\r\n\r\nwhich  has come from overseas. While we are proud  that\r\n\r\nwe  are independent and would like very much to rely on\r\n\r\nour own ability and our own strength, nevertheless,  we\r\n\r\nshould   also   recognise  our   own   weaknesses   and\r\n\r\ndeficiencies.  And  if  we  adopt  a  dog-in-the-manger\r\n\r\nattitude  while  we  are still not  in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nimprove  our  own  technical skill, then  I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nSingapore will take a very long time to develop. It  is\r\n\r\non  these grounds that we have adopted a liberal policy\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis      applications     by      industrialists,\r\n\r\ntechnologists, professional men and other  experts  who\r\n\r\ncome here to help in some way or other our commerce and\r\n\r\nindustry  for  a  short period. These persons  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing to stay in Singapore permanently. In most cases a\r\n\r\nperiod  of 12 months' stay is granted to them.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of this particular catering officer, I myself  am\r\n\r\nnot  quite  sure about the circumstances for supporting\r\n\r\nhis  application,  but  I will investigate  it  when  I\r\n\r\nreturn to the office tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the sum of $14,880 under the subhead of\r\n\r\nMaintenance Removal and Repatriation Expenses, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  explain to the Member for Choa Chu Kang  that\r\n\r\nthis  money is used to feed illegal immigrants  in  our\r\n\r\ndetention gaol when they are caught out, and  also  the\r\n\r\ncost of repatriating them will be borne by this sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney.  We  have  from time to time unwelcome  visitors\r\n\r\nfrom  neighbouring islands, and when  they  are  caught\r\n\r\nout, they have to be kept here until we can find a boat\r\n\r\nor  an aeroplane to pack them back.

Can\r\n\r\nthe   Immigration  Department  and  other   departments\r\n\r\nconcerned  do  anything?  These  people  have  received\r\n\r\nfacilities which are the same as those for citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  who have birth certificates and  citizenship\r\n\r\nregistration certificates. Unfortunately, these  people\r\n\r\ndo  not  receive  the  facilities  as  given  by  other\r\n\r\ndepartments. May I know from the Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  this  is  one  of  the  requirements  of   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department, to demand that all  applicants\r\n\r\nfor  passports to go abroad must show their citizenship\r\n\r\ncertificates or their birth certificates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nfully  appreciate  that in recent years  we  have  been\r\n\r\nrather  restrictive in our immigration policy in  order\r\n\r\nto   control   the   immigration  of  foreigners   into\r\n\r\nSingapore. This, of course, is due to the fact that  we\r\n\r\nare  a  small  island  State with  hardly  any  natural\r\n\r\nresources  and  we  cannot  afford  to  have  an  over-populated  population.  That is  why  we  must  have  a\r\n\r\nrestrictive immigration policy which is quite different\r\n\r\nfrom  that of 1948 when the policy was rather  lax.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time we had only about a million population,  but\r\n\r\nnow  we  have  double  that  figure, i.e.,  about  two\r\n\r\nmillion.  As our Deputy Prime Minister is aware,  there\r\n\r\nare  many  citizens in Singapore who  have  parents  in\r\n\r\nIndia or China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the difficulties of earning a livelihood\r\n\r\nin  these  two  countries and  also  because  of  their\r\n\r\nadvanced  age, these parents of our local citizens  are\r\n\r\nrather helpless in their country of birth. So they have\r\n\r\nwritten  repeatedly  to their children  here,  who  are\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens, asking them to apply  for  permits\r\n\r\nfor  them  to enter Singapore. As a matter of fact,  we\r\n\r\nhave  approved  a  few  hundred such  applications  and\r\n\r\nallowed  many people to come in every year.  But  there\r\n\r\nare still many whose applications have been rejected on\r\n\r\nthe  ground of their age. The stipulated age  limit  is\r\n\r\nnow  65 years, but the applicants may be 62 or 63 years\r\n\r\nold and they are therefore not eligible to come here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be another set of grounds for\r\n\r\ndisqualification. The applicants may have relatives  in\r\n\r\nChina  to  depend on. For example, in my  constituency,\r\n\r\nthere is a voter who complained to me that he had  made\r\n\r\nan application for his-mother to come to Singapore, but\r\n\r\nbecause  he  has a nephew in China his application  was\r\n\r\nrejected.  But according to this voter, his nephew  was\r\n\r\nsent  away  from his parents in China to Manchuria,  so\r\n\r\nthat  he is not in a position to look after his  mother\r\n\r\nin   China.   I  hope  that  the  Minister  will   give\r\n\r\nsympathetic  consideration and approve the applications\r\n\r\nof  the cases which I have mentioned so that these aged\r\n\r\nparents  will be allowed to come here and reunite  with\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another type of\r\n\r\napplicants. Some people were born here about ten  years\r\n\r\nago.  According  to  our immigration  regulations,  any\r\n\r\nperson  who leaves Singapore for a period of more  than\r\n\r\nfive  years will be treated as an alien and he  is  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to re-enter Singapore. I have received several\r\n\r\ncomplaints  on this matter. For example, in  one  case,\r\n\r\nthe  applicant was born in Singapore. He left Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  a  period  of  five years and a  few  months.  His\r\n\r\nparents applied for an entry permit for him, but  their\r\n\r\napplication was rejected on the ground that he had been\r\n\r\naway\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore for a period of more than five years. In\r\n\r\nthe  past,  some  people went to China under  emotional\r\n\r\ncircumstances or for other reasons. In so far as  their\r\n\r\nbirth-place is concerned, they should be considered  as\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens  by  birth.  Although  they   left\r\n\r\nSingapore on impulse, they have now realised  that  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  in some countries are not  so  good  and\r\n\r\nthey  find  it necessary to come back here.  They  have\r\n\r\nrelatives here. They are helpless in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nSo we should sympathise with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point, Mr Speaker, Sir. I have\r\n\r\nreceived another complaint which has been brought up by\r\n\r\nother   Members   of  this  House.  This   relates   to\r\n\r\napplications for visit passes which require that  there\r\n\r\nmust  be  some guarantors to pay some kind of  deposit.\r\n\r\nSome  of these visitors would like to extend the period\r\n\r\nof  their stay in Singapore for a further three or  six\r\n\r\nmonths.   In   such   circumstances,  the   Immigration\r\n\r\nauthorities  would  ask  them to  put  down  some  more\r\n\r\ndeposit. But in my view, as they have already put  down\r\n\r\na deposit once and may have a return ticket as well, it\r\n\r\nis  not necessary for them to put down a second deposit\r\n\r\nto  extend their period of stay here because  it  is  a\r\n\r\nvery troublesome and redundant procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally. Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to bring to\r\n\r\nthe   attention  of  the  Minister  certain  complaints\r\n\r\nregarding  the  attitude  of  some  officers   in   the\r\n\r\nImmigration Department. I do not know whether  this  is\r\n\r\ntrue, but I would like him to look into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Nobody can  say\r\n\r\nthat  just because he is a citizen he must be  given  a\r\n\r\npassport.  According  to the Ordinance,  passports  are\r\n\r\nissued  at the discretion of the Minister in charge  of\r\n\r\nImmigration. Sometimes there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases  which come up before the Department where it  is\r\n\r\nquestionable whether passports should be given to  such\r\n\r\npeople, particularly when information has been received\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Security  Branch  of  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nInterior  and  Defence  that such  and  such  a  person\r\n\r\nproposes  to travel abroad for some illegal purpose  to\r\n\r\nfurther  his clandestine activities, or to make contact\r\n\r\nwith  smugglers  or  make other  types  of  undesirable\r\n\r\ncontacts.  When  it  comes to our  knowledge  that  the\r\n\r\npassports  in  such  cases will  be  abused,  then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it is up to the Minister to decide whether  or\r\n\r\nnot such applications should be considered. I think  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  very  foolish  if, knowing  full  well  from\r\n\r\ninformation received that these persons are going to do\r\n\r\nthis  country no good by their travel overseas, we were\r\n\r\nto give them passports so that they can carry out their\r\n\r\nobjectives.  There is no difference between  a  citizen\r\n\r\nborn  in  Singapore and a citizen by  registration.  In\r\n\r\nmost cases -- I would say in 99.9 per cent of cases  -\r\n\r\npassports are given and it is only in the 0.1 per  cent\r\n\r\nof cases where doubts are very strong indeed that these\r\n\r\nare undesirable characters who are going to subvert the\r\n\r\nsecurity of the State, or who are going to make contact\r\n\r\nwith the underworld, the smugglers, that passports  are\r\n\r\nnot given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Sembawang, those who leave\r\n\r\nSingapore  without  a re-entry permit  surely  must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  persons  who  do  not  wish  to  retain\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship, and we assume that such  persons\r\n\r\nare enjoying the rights and privileges of the countries\r\n\r\nthey have gone to. If this is so, then they will not be\r\n\r\ncarrying Singapore passports; neither will they have re-entry permits. Therefore, technically, whether they are\r\n\r\nborn  here or not, they have no right to be re-admitted\r\n\r\nto  Singapore. It is only in bona fide cases where they\r\n\r\ncarry  passports and have been given the right  of  re-entry  that  they  will be allowed to return.  I  would\r\n\r\nconsider  persons  who have run off illegally  as  mere\r\n\r\nopportunists  who hope to improve their  own  prospects\r\n\r\noutside  this country, but when they find  that  things\r\n\r\nare   not   going  too  well  for  them   they   become\r\n\r\ndisillusioned and want to return here. I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbelieve  that sympathy should be given to such persons.\r\n\r\nFrankly, if such opportunists are allowed to return,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  believe they will contribute anything  to  the\r\n\r\nwelfare - politically or otherwise - of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sorry indeed that applications from parents\r\n\r\nwho  are  62 years old have been rejected. But we  must\r\n\r\ndraw the line somewhere. The line is 65 years old.  If\r\n\r\na person is 62 years old, it is regrettable indeed that\r\n\r\nhis  application will not be considered. The best  that\r\n\r\ncan  happen is for him to wait until he or  she  is  65\r\n\r\nyears old. We cannot one day say, \"Well, the line is 65\r\n\r\nyears  old. But, never mind, because you are my special\r\n\r\nfriend,  I will make it 62 years old.\" And having  made\r\n\r\nit 62 years old, somebody comes along and says, \"I have\r\n\r\na  mother  or a father who is 61 years old or 60  years\r\n\r\nold.\"  And  so we go along a policy which  is  neither\r\n\r\nfixed  nor  determined, and in the end we will  end  up\r\n\r\nquite  confused as to whether immigration has  or  does\r\n\r\nnot have a policy. I must reiterate to all Members that\r\n\r\nwe  are  very sympathetic to our citizens whose parents\r\n\r\nare living in those countries where times are hard,  be\r\n\r\nit in India or in China. But I am quite sure that these\r\n\r\nparents  have other relatives, other children,  uncles,\r\n\r\nbrothers or sisters with whom they are living. It  must\r\n\r\nbe  so, otherwise they would have applied for admission\r\n\r\nto  Singapore long, long ago. This is a policy we  have\r\n\r\nkept  all these years and we propose to carry  on  with\r\n\r\nit,  that parents must be 65 years old and above before\r\n\r\ntheir  applications can be considered.  Besides,  there\r\n\r\nmust  be adequate proof that they rely solely on  their\r\n\r\nchildren in Singapore for their maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the complaint about discourtesy by immigration\r\n\r\nofficials, I myself have put on the carpet officials of\r\n\r\nthe   Immigration   Department,   and   I   hope   that\r\n\r\nirresponsible officials will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearn  a  lesson.  If they do not  and  I  continue  to\r\n\r\nreceive further complaints about discourtesy or lack of\r\n\r\npublic relations, then there will be no alternative but\r\n\r\nto  submit  them  to  a departmental  inquiry  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, have them removed, transferred, or have them\r\n\r\nretired  in the public interest.

The facilities there are very poor,  as\r\n\r\nthe  authority  concerned has not planned  sufficiently\r\n\r\nfor  the  postal services. From the Budget we see  that\r\n\r\nonly $600 is provided for these services next year.  If\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  carefully plan now,  then  in  future  the\r\n\r\npostmen will not even go up to the flats to deliver the\r\n\r\nletters. If our Minister were to go to Bukit Timah Hill\r\n\r\nand  build a house there, then he would not be able  to\r\n\r\nreceive his letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of our society must be a balanced\r\n\r\none.  As  we  have  built so many  houses,  the  postal\r\n\r\nservices must be adequate to cope with the needs. If we\r\n\r\ndo  not  do  this well, the whole Government  machinery\r\n\r\nwill  be lopsided; it will be like a car losing one  of\r\n\r\nits four wheels. There will be uneven development, with\r\n\r\nthe  result that although more houses are built,  there\r\n\r\nare  not enough postal services provided, resulting  in\r\n\r\nchaos and confusion. We hope that the Minister will pay\r\n\r\ncareful consideration to this item.

What\r\n\r\nI  mean  to  say is that we should, whenever  possible,\r\n\r\nmake our stamps reflect our way of life and the various\r\n\r\ncultural  and  other characteristics of our  people  so\r\n\r\nthat they can be representative of the various features\r\n\r\nof  our  people.  Stamps can be  very  useful  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.  For  instance,  if a person  has  contributed\r\n\r\ngreatly  to  our country's welfare, then  we  may  have\r\n\r\ncertain  stamps depicting his image to commemorate  his\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the country. This will  serve  as  an\r\n\r\nencouragement to our people to emulate his example.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, stamps should also reflect our society\r\n\r\nin   which  the  four  races  are  living  harmoniously\r\n\r\ntogether, because the mails will be sent throughout the\r\n\r\nworld,  and  foreigners will be able to understand  our\r\n\r\nsocial  background and our livelihood. So these  stamps\r\n\r\nwill  serve as useful ambassadors of Singapore in these\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I  would not say that in  the  past  our\r\n\r\nstamps  were not beautiful, but they contained  only  a\r\n\r\nfish  or  a  bird or perhaps a centipede. Perhaps  they\r\n\r\nwere  not  too  significant, and if  they  were  posted\r\n\r\nabroad,   the  people  who  received  them  would   not\r\n\r\nunderstand what these pictures represented. The  stamps\r\n\r\nof  the  Republic  of  Communist China,  for  instance,\r\n\r\nreflect and commemorate what their people have done for\r\n\r\ntheir  country; images of national heroes are depicted.\r\n\r\nSo  I  hope that we can also emulate their example  and\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister can tell us why there is such a  big\r\n\r\nincrease in the vote for next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

If there are no absentees from driving\r\n\r\ntesters due to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nillness  or  otherwise, an approximate  number  of  160\r\n\r\npeople will be tested every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these 160 people, there are about 120\r\n\r\npeople who are present there every morning trying their\r\n\r\nluck in the ballot to have their driving test, and only\r\n\r\nthree to five people will be lucky enough to have their\r\n\r\ntest, leaving the others disappointed. Even these three\r\n\r\nto  five  people  are confronted with difficulties.  If\r\n\r\nthey  are  Mandarin-speaking, they  are  likely  to  be\r\n\r\nturned  away.  The reason given is that  there  are  no\r\n\r\nMandarin-speaking testers. Sir, from what I know, there\r\n\r\nare  about  eight to nine Mandarin-speaking testers  in\r\n\r\nthe   Driving  Testing  Department.  Why   cannot   the\r\n\r\nadministrative  side allot the testing fairly  just  to\r\n\r\navoid disappointing the people who wish to be tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring to the Minister of\r\n\r\nState's  attention  is that there is  really  an  acute\r\n\r\nshortage  of testers nowadays. A person who has  failed\r\n\r\nin  his  first test will have to wait for three  months\r\n\r\nfor  a  retest. Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto  increase  the number of testers to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  there  is  another point. I think all  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments start work at 9.00 o'clock in the  morning.\r\n\r\nI  stand  to  be corrected if I am wrong. I  have  made\r\n\r\npersonal  investigations  into  the  time  of   driving\r\n\r\ntesting and, to my surprise, the first car to move  out\r\n\r\nfor  testing  is always after 10.00 a.m. This  sort  of\r\n\r\nattitude should be corrected at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  believe  you  know that the number  of  vehicles  is\r\n\r\nincreasing. It means that it is becoming too  easy  for\r\n\r\npeople  to  get driving licences. Because of  the  ease\r\n\r\nwith  which they get driving licences, this will affect\r\n\r\nand  endanger our road safety. A few days ago the Vice-Chairman of the Safety First Council was involved in  a\r\n\r\ncollision  with a police officer's car.  If  the  Vice-Chairman  of  the  Safety First  Council  could  be  so\r\n\r\nunsafe, how do you expect members of the public  to  be\r\n\r\nsafe  on  the road? The reason may well be that perhaps\r\n\r\nthese  two  persons were trying to give  way  to  other\r\n\r\ndrivers who were lacking in driving experience and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho had got their driving licences recently. If that is\r\n\r\r\nthe  case  with  most  of  the applicants  for  driving\r\n\r\nlicences,  then  it  would be a great  hazard  to  road\r\n\r\nsafety.  Therefore, I hope that the  testers  will  pay\r\n\r\ngreater  attention to and exercise more stringent  care\r\n\r\nin the issue of driving licences to people undergoing a\r\n\r\ndriving  test. Otherwise, even if we have  more  Safety\r\n\r\nFirst  Councils, we may not be able to maintain  safety\r\n\r\non the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the provision of 18 testers, I hope\r\n\r\nall   of   them  will  be  more  stringent  in  testing\r\n\r\napplicants and maintain a good standard before  driving\r\n\r\nlicences  are issued to these applicants  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard road safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi has mentioned about testers  who  do\r\n\r\nnot  know Mandarin. Actually nine out of the 14 testers\r\n\r\ndo  know  Mandarin. So this question  does  not  arise.\r\n\r\nThere  will be more opportunities. If the person speaks\r\n\r\nMandarin,   the  tester  will  be  a  Mandarin-speaking\r\n\r\ntester. If he is a Malay, a Malay-speaking tester. This\r\n\r\nis what has been carried out so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says other departments begin work at 9.00 o'clock\r\n\r\nbut  this department begins work at 10.00 o'clock. This\r\n\r\nis  not  true. Actually the department starts  work  at\r\n\r\n9.00 o'clock, but because arrangements have to be made,\r\n\r\nit  is  only  within the hour that they  can  find  out\r\n\r\nwhether the people to be tested are present or not.  It\r\n\r\nis  because  of this that the first car  comes  out  at\r\n\r\n10.00 o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the shortage of testers, I would like to\r\n\r\nstate here that in 1961 there were only 14 testers.  It\r\n\r\nwas increased by two in 1962 and then two more in 1965.\r\n\r\nNext year we will reconsider the position. However that\r\n\r\nmay  be,  everyone who takes out a provisional  licence\r\n\r\ncan  be  tested after three and a half months from  the\r\n\r\ndate  of  application, so that he can  learn  to  drive\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point brought up by the Member for\r\n\r\nDelta.  I  would like to say that the testers  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven instructions to be very careful in their testing.\r\n\r\nFew  people are passed by the testers.

Under  the\r\n\r\nold Government this department was the object of attack\r\n\r\nby  members of the public, because when they went  into\r\n\r\nthe  department to pay their road taxes  and  do  other\r\n\r\nbusiness,  they had to wait for at least two  hours  to\r\n\r\nhalf  a  day.  Since  the P.A.P. Government  came  into\r\n\r\noffice  in  1959,  there has been a  great  change  and\r\n\r\nimprovement in this department. Members of  the  public\r\n\r\nare  generally satisfied with it. But I would like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  pay  attention  to  this  point.  It   is\r\n\r\nnecessary to make the officials of this department more\r\n\r\nefficient in order to meet the expectations of  members\r\n\r\nof  the  public.

But\r\n\r\naccording  to  what  I have gathered,  there  are  many\r\n\r\npeople who are still waiting to have taxis to drive  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  living.

Could the Minister consider at the  same\r\n\r\ntime  whether any women, if they wish to join,  can  do\r\n\r\nso?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  fully support the suggestion made by the Member  for\r\n\r\nAljunied  that  the people today should be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nshoulder  the responsibility to defend the country  and\r\n\r\nthat we should not be discriminatory against women. But\r\n\r\nI  do  not  understand why in the present  campaign  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  Vigilante  Corps  members,  the  Minister   of\r\n\r\nDefence is recruiting only men, and women are excluded.\r\n\r\nI  understand there are certain community centres which\r\n\r\nhave  registered  some voluntary women  applicants  and\r\n\r\ntheir  performance is better than the men's. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why  the  Minister does not take women  into  the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps. I would like him to give me an  answer\r\n\r\nto this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the\r\n\r\ninformation  of  the  hon.  Member  for  Delta,  in  my\r\n\r\ncommunity centre we have women Vigilante Corps members.\r\n\r\nThis  House  will  agree with me that  members  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Vigilante Corps are playing a major  part  in\r\n\r\nhelping the police force to preserve peace and order in\r\n\r\nour  country. The general public is certainly  grateful\r\n\r\nto  them  for their voluntary services. But the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  Vigilante Corps up to now has  not  been  well\r\n\r\nlooked  after by the Government. Their members are  now\r\n\r\ngetting  drinks,  coffee and sugar  from  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  and cigarettes contributed  by  the  well-wishers  from  the public. As we all know,  they  often\r\n\r\nencounter  great  difficulties while  performing  their\r\n\r\nduties.  They are unarmed and, in the course  of  their\r\n\r\nduties, may injure themselves or even lose their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, there were two members from my\r\n\r\nconstituency  who were injured while on duty.  One  was\r\n\r\nhurt during coastal patrol duties at Kampong Amber, and\r\n\r\nthe  other  sustained injuries when he met  a  gang  of\r\n\r\nfighters  at Tanjong Rhu. Sir, I took up the  cases  of\r\n\r\nthese   two   unfortunate  members  with   the   proper\r\n\r\nauthorities, the People's Association, for compensation\r\n\r\nabout  a  year  ago,  but  to date  no  news  has  been\r\n\r\nreceived.   As   we  all  appreciate  their   voluntary\r\n\r\nservices,  we  must provide them with compensation  and\r\n\r\nadequate  cover  in order to safeguard their  lives.  I\r\n\r\nvaguely  remember  there was a scheme for  compensation\r\n\r\nfor V.C. members known as the Singapore Vigilante Corps\r\n\r\nPension  and Gratuity Regulations, 1965. May I  request\r\n\r\nthe Minister to inform the House whether the scheme for\r\n\r\ncompensation  under these Regulations for V.C. members\r\n\r\nhas actually been implemented or not? Sir, a scheme for\r\n\r\ncompensation or gratuity is very essential,  especially\r\n\r\nas  we are now campaigning for more members to join the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps,  and their welfare should  be  looked\r\n\r\nafter, as we cannot afford to lose their services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect of welfare which Government\r\n\r\ncan look after, i.e., their travelling allowances. Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the  People's Defence Force, when we go for  parade\r\n\r\ntraining we get parade allowances. But V.C. members get\r\n\r\nno   travelling  allowances.  In  some  constituencies,\r\n\r\nespecially the well-to-do ones, the Vigilante Corps  is\r\n\r\noften  supported by local communities or  well-wishers.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  went  to Tampines last week, I  saw  that  the\r\n\r\norganisation  there  was very  poor.  I  believe  their\r\n\r\nfinancial support is not very strong. Perhaps  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason why the V.C. members are not active  enough\r\n\r\nin  that  constituency.  So it  is  my  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  give  serious  thought  to   granting\r\n\r\ntravelling allowances and compensation for V.C. members\r\n\r\nwhen they are injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, as\r\n\r\nregards  a  women's  Vigilante  Corps,  some  community\r\n\r\ncentres have already formed their own women's Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps and I see no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nharm in other community centres doing the same. But for\r\n\r\nthe  time being, so far as the training programme goes,\r\n\r\nwe  are concentrating on the men first. Maybe in a year\r\n\r\nor two when we have sufficient activities organised for\r\n\r\nthe  men,  we may make a properly-organised  effort  to\r\n\r\nraise  a  women's Vigilante Corps. So  the  answer,  in\r\n\r\nbrief,   is  that  if  the  management  committees   of\r\n\r\ncommunity centres want to invite women members to  join\r\n\r\nthe  Vigilante Corps, they can do so. The expenses  and\r\n\r\ntraining must be borne by these management committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has raised a number of\r\n\r\npoints. As regards compensation, the compensation rules\r\n\r\nare in force. If the two cases which he has referred to\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association have been stuck, I think  the\r\n\r\nfault  may rest with these two applicants. In the first\r\n\r\ninstance,   they   should  not  have  submitted   their\r\n\r\napplications to the People's Association.  They  should\r\n\r\naddress  their  applications  to  the  Vigilante  Corps\r\n\r\nHeadquarters.  If  the  Member  will  give  me  further\r\n\r\ndetails, I will try to see what has gone wrong in  this\r\n\r\ninstance.  It  could be, of course, that  they  do  not\r\n\r\nqualify  for any compensation if the injuries sustained\r\n\r\nare very trivial in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is travelling allowances. I see no\r\n\r\ncase  for  giving them travelling allowances. Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  service  is  intended to be a voluntary  service\r\n\r\ngiven   by  patriotic  young  men  and  women  to   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  There is no case for travelling  allowances\r\n\r\nbecause  the duties of the Vigilante Corps are  carried\r\n\r\nout very close to their homes, and all they have to  do\r\n\r\nis to walk to their place of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards poor activity in Tampines, I do not think\r\n\r\nthe  reason  is  the absence of travelling  allowances,\r\n\r\nbecause  we have very active Vigilante Corps  units  in\r\n\r\nother  places where travelling allowances are not paid.\r\n\r\nIt could be that there is poor leadership in this unit.\r\n\r\nWhat should be done is to replace the leadership rather\r\n\r\nthan to pay travelling allowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> The Minister has not answered\r\n\r\nwhether the Singapore Vigilante Corps Pension and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGratuity  Regulations, 1965, have been  implemented  or\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In fact, there were two buildings which were  not\r\n\r\ndecorated. One - of course, we cannot blame them -  was\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian High Commission Office. But the building\r\n\r\nnext  to  that  -  the General Post Office  -  was  not\r\n\r\ndecorated  at all. I will be happier if this  will  not\r\n\r\nhappen next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I can give no assurances that it\r\n\r\nwill  not  happen next year.

The policy  at  the\r\n\r\nlast  National  Day parade was to move  away  from  the\r\n\r\ndecoration  of Government offices to the decoration  of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntown as a whole, particularly Chinatown both north  and\r\n\r\nsouth of the river. So with a given sum of money and  a\r\n\r\nfixed  budget to operate on, we have to decide  whether\r\n\r\nwe  want to brighten up the city, particularly the slum\r\n\r\nareas, North and South Bridge Roads, or whether we want\r\n\r\nto  spend  money on brightening up Government  offices.\r\n\r\nPrevious  to  the last National Day, the  practice  had\r\n\r\nbeen  to  spend  large  sums  of  money  on  decorating\r\n\r\nbuildings with bunting, coloured bulbs, and so on. That\r\n\r\nwas  so even in the old colonial days. But I confess  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see any merit in that. I think it is better  to\r\n\r\nbrighten up the main streets and the main thoroughfares\r\n\r\nof the city where people live, so that everyone will be\r\n\r\nmade  more conscious of the importance of the occasion.\r\n\r\nAfter all, National Day is a holiday and people do  not\r\n\r\ngo  to Government offices on that day because they  are\r\n\r\nall closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Post Office was not the only Government\r\n\r\nbuilding  that  was not decorated.

The police intake  is  not  on  the\r\n\r\nincrease, it has greatly decreased this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after we left Malaysia, there was a very\r\n\r\nsubstantial recruitment drive for the police force.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the first intake after we became independent  was\r\n\r\nthe  largest  in  history. Something  like  nearly  800\r\n\r\nrecruits  were taken in in one draft. But  since  then,\r\n\r\nmost of the police vacancies have been filled. The next\r\n\r\nintake for January will be just over 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These teachers' allowances are not paid merely to\r\n\r\npeople teaching the national language. They are also to\r\n\r\nprovide   instruction  in  various   promotion   tests,\r\n\r\nexaminations  for corporals, inspectors, sergeants  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  One reason why the provision for next year  is\r\n\r\nless  than that for this year is that the sum allocated\r\n\r\nfor  this  year has not been spent fully. We find  that\r\n\r\nmany policemen prefer to attend adult education classes\r\n\r\nrather  than  classes provided at the  Police  Training\r\n\r\nSchool.

But,  as a matter of fact,  this  is  only  a\r\n\r\ntemporary measure. There will come a day when  we  will\r\n\r\nhave to rely on only ourselves for defence and internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past year, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nthe  Interior  and  Defence took steps  to  expand  the\r\n\r\npolice and the army and great achievements were made in\r\n\r\nthis  field. There has been a tremendous response  from\r\n\r\nvarious quarters to join the Police Defence Force. So I\r\n\r\nmust congratulate the Minister on his achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum allocated is $78,894,020, which is more than\r\n\r\nthe  estimate for last year. The increase is due to the\r\n\r\nnecessity  of  buying more military  vehicles  and  for\r\n\r\nother  expansion  purposes.  It  also  shows  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  made careful and long-term planning  for\r\n\r\nthe future. This is a very appropriate move indeed. But\r\n\r\nI   would   like  to  offer  certain  points  for   his\r\n\r\nconsideration  so  that  the expansion  scheme  in  the\r\n\r\nInterior and Defence field will have more objectives of\r\n\r\nan idealistic nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the training of members of the Police\r\n\r\nDefence  Force, we must not only train them in the  use\r\n\r\nof  arms  but  we must also have, at the same  time,  a\r\n\r\nnational  curriculum  to instil in  them  a  spirit  of\r\n\r\npatriotism and national consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I hope that the plans for civil servants to\r\n\r\nundergo military training will be implemented as  early\r\n\r\nas possible, and it can be undertaken on a part-time or\r\n\r\noff-time basis in the early stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I hope that the authorities concerned will\r\n\r\ntake  more effective measures to carry out the work  of\r\n\r\ndefence and security so that the lives and property  of\r\n\r\nour people will be better protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I would like the Ministry to stop children\r\n\r\nfrom  playing poker and other games on five-foot  ways.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, hawkers operate tikam-tikam on five-foot\r\n\r\nways.  A child picks out a number and, if he is  lucky,\r\n\r\nhe  will get 30 cents or some other prize; otherwise he\r\n\r\nloses his stake of five cents. This kind of tikam-tikam\r\n\r\ngame is very detrimental to our school children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with a\r\n\r\nlot  of what the hon. Member has said, particularly  as\r\n\r\nregards the cultivation of national consciousness. This\r\n\r\nhas  to  be done not only in the Defence Forces  but  I\r\n\r\nthink  throughout the entire population. So far as  the\r\n\r\nDefence   Forces   are  concerned,   my   Ministry   is\r\n\r\nestablishing an educational corps which will consist of\r\n\r\nofficers  and N.C.O.s whose duty would be  to  do  just\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of thing, to tell soldiers how  to  conduct\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  what their duties and responsibilities\r\n\r\nare,  so  that  they  can fulfil their  functions  more\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the implementation of the plan for civil service\r\n\r\nofficials  to do P.D.F. and army duties, this  will  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out as announced, that is, next year. All  new\r\n\r\nemployees  in Government and statutory bodies  will  be\r\n\r\ncalled up to do this service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On children gambling, I do not know what the Member\r\n\r\nhas  in  mind. Does he want the police to  arrest  them\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  found gambling? The police  have  been\r\n\r\narresting children when they are engaged in gambling in\r\n\r\npublic,  as  this is against the law. But I  think  the\r\n\r\nmain  responsibility lies with the parents to see  that\r\n\r\ntheir  children are brought up properly, that  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  gamble  in  public or, for that  matter,  anywhere\r\n\r\nelse.  The best deterrent is to whack the child on  his\r\n\r\nbottom.  I  think  leaders of opinion  and  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  help  bring  about  this  state  of\r\n\r\ndiscipline among children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About hawkers' tikam-tikam, I do not know. When I was\r\n\r\nin  school, I remember an ice-cream man doing this sort\r\n\r\nof  thing.  But you always get something.  You  do  not\r\n\r\nlose.  You either get a big portion or a small portion.\r\n\r\nSo  if  hawkers are doing that, I do not  know  whether\r\n\r\nthat  is against the law. But, of course, if they  give\r\n\r\nnothing  away, I agree that it is quite deplorable.  If\r\n\r\nthe Member has any concrete information, I suggest that\r\n\r\nhe  lay  a  complaint  before the police  so  that  the\r\n\r\nculprits can be apprehended and dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to bring forward two other points in  reply\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister.  I  agree that it  is  probably  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the  parents  to  see  that   their\r\n\r\nchildren  do not gamble. But if the police can  give  a\r\n\r\nwarning to such children, I think that will serve  them\r\n\r\nwell and help to check this gambling in public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning this tikam-tikam business, Mr Speaker, if\r\n\r\nit  is  merely  a matter of winning a small  or  a  big\r\n\r\nprize,  then I agree it is quite all right. If you  put\r\n\r\ndown  a  5-cent stake, you may win or lose 5 cents.  If\r\n\r\nyou  win,  you may sometimes have a prize of 20  or  30\r\n\r\ncents. But often the draws result in blanks - no prize.\r\n\r\nThat  is quite a different experience from that of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  in his childhood -when he was quite  sure  of\r\n\r\ngetting  something in the tikam-tikam which he  himself\r\n\r\nindulged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This  is  indeed   a   very\r\n\r\ncommendable,  farsighted, praiseworthy,  and  judicious\r\n\r\npolicy.  Our  achievements  in  the  field  of  foreign\r\n\r\naffairs  are  really encouraging indeed. In  the  first\r\n\r\nplace,  we have smoothly gained admission to the United\r\n\r\nNations.  We  have also been admitted to various  other\r\n\r\ninternational  organisations, such  as  ECAFE  and  the\r\n\r\nAsian Development Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the establishment of diplomatic relations with\r\n\r\nvarious  countries  in the world,  we  have  also  made\r\n\r\nachievements. We have set up diplomatic relations  with\r\n\r\nmany countries in Asia, Africa and Europe. We have even\r\n\r\nsent  diplomatic missions to India, Cambodia and  other\r\n\r\ncountries. Indonesia, too, has resumed trade  relations\r\n\r\nwith us. On the European continent, Italy, West Germany\r\n\r\nand  other countries have also become friends with  us.\r\n\r\nBoth  Canada and America have established relationships\r\n\r\nwith us. Bulgaria, Hungary and Russia have signed trade\r\n\r\npacts  and are doing business with us so that our trade\r\n\r\nand economic income will increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are a small country, and according to\r\n\r\na  saying, a small country could have no diplomacy. But\r\n\r\nin  the  present  context, this  saying  is  no  longer\r\n\r\napplicable,  because in the United Nations,  which  has\r\n\r\n120  members, there are many countries which  are  very\r\n\r\nsmall  in size and population - about 70 per cent.  And\r\n\r\nit is this 70 per cent (the small countries) which have\r\n\r\nthe  majority vote. So although our country  is  small,\r\n\r\nour voice for justice and righteousness can and must be\r\n\r\ntransmitted all over the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our love of peace must also be transmitted. We cannot\r\n\r\nbe swayed in our stand in this regard. For example, our\r\n\r\nchief   representative  in  the  United  Nations,   Mr\r\n\r\nCoomaraswamy,   recently  spoke  in  support   of   the\r\n\r\nadmission of China to the United Nations. He said  that\r\n\r\nthe   policy   to  shut  out  China  is  improper   and\r\n\r\nunreasonable. The Prime Minister has also condemned the\r\n\r\nminority   regime   in  Southern  Rhodesia.   This   is\r\n\r\nrepresentative of our sense of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the vote to be allocated to the Foreign Ministry\r\n\r\nfor  next  year,  I  note  that  the  sum  is  slightly\r\n\r\nincreased. But I think the increase is insufficient. So\r\n\r\nI  would  like the Minister for Finance to  consider  a\r\n\r\nfurther increase in the vote for this Ministry. At  the\r\n\r\npresent moment, the number of foreign missions  set  up\r\n\r\nis  inadequate.  The  money  to  be  spent  on  foreign\r\n\r\nmissions  is  not  wasted at all, because  if  we  have\r\n\r\ncloser  diplomatic relations with other  countries,  it\r\n\r\nwill  mean  that  our  trade  relations  also  will  be\r\n\r\nimproved or further strengthened. That means that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  economic returns for us. In other  words,  we\r\n\r\nwill be able to earn more foreign exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to bring to the attention of\r\n\r\nthe Minister is that in recruiting staff for diplomatic\r\n\r\nmissions at present, it seems that the English-educated\r\n\r\nhave   some  kind  of  supremacy,  because  the  common\r\n\r\nlanguage  officially used so far is  English.  We  must\r\n\r\nalso  realise  that  Malay is  our  national  language.\r\n\r\nAlthough  in the diplomatic field, English is the  more\r\n\r\ncommon language, we must have officers with a knowledge\r\n\r\nof  Malay, because some people may not want to speak to\r\n\r\nyou  in  English but in Malay. So if our own  diplomats\r\n\r\ncannot  speak  our national language when addressed  in\r\n\r\nthat language, it will be a big joke indeed. So I would\r\n\r\nlike the Minister to pay attention to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that protocol officers are\r\n\r\ninsufficient   in   number.   I   have   heard    about\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from foreign lands visiting  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf  one  foreign  visitor comes for one  day  then  our\r\n\r\nprotocol officers will be able to bring him round.  But\r\n\r\nif  we  have two or three foreign visitors in one  day,\r\n\r\nthen  our  protocol officers will be  short-handed  and\r\n\r\nthey will be unable to bring them round our country. If\r\n\r\nthis  news  spreads overseas, then it is  not  a  great\r\n\r\ncredit  to us. It is far from complimentary. So I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  will  increase the  number  of  protocol\r\n\r\nofficers in order that our distinguished visitors  will\r\n\r\nbe better treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  personally I would like to bring up only  one\r\n\r\npoint under this Head, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  in  selecting the  heads  of  diplomatic\r\n\r\nmissions.   We  all  know  that  when  a   country   is\r\n\r\nindependent, it must set up friendly relationships with\r\n\r\nother  countries.  It  is no exception  for  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is an international port and  so  it  has  a\r\n\r\nspecial position to consider. Our commercial activities\r\n\r\nhave  been  closely linked for a long  time  with  many\r\n\r\nother  countries  in the world, so invariably  this  is\r\n\r\nreflected  in  our diplomatic officers,  such  as  High\r\n\r\nCommissioners and Ambassadors, who include  dignitaries\r\n\r\nfrom  the  commercial field. This is  no  surprise,  of\r\n\r\ncourse. But I feel that diplomatic officers are experts\r\n\r\nthemselves.  They  are professional people,  they  must\r\n\r\nreceive  special  training, and they  must  be  persons\r\n\r\nhighly  qualified academically, because they are  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  the ordinary civil  servants  and  the\r\n\r\nordinary  people  in our own country. Their  activities\r\n\r\nabroad  are  supposed to be representative of  our  own\r\n\r\ncountry, and they serve as a bridge between our country\r\n\r\nand other countries in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on a long-term basis those who represent us abroad\r\n\r\nin  foreign  missions must be people  who  have  expert\r\n\r\nknowledge, like professors and other very knowledgeable\r\n\r\npersons, comparatively speaking, so that they  will  be\r\n\r\nmore suitable for this purpose. I do not, for a moment,\r\n\r\ntry to speak ill of the capacity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  status of some commercial people. I just  want  to\r\n\r\nbring this fact to the attention of the Minister - that\r\n\r\nif  these  people from the commercial field  have  some\r\n\r\ndealings in business relating to our trade at the  same\r\n\r\ntime, I do not know whether there may be a conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterests between the two. So I would like to tell you,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, that in future the selection of diplomatic\r\n\r\nheads  of missions must be from professional and  well-trained  people, so that they will be able to  shoulder\r\n\r\ntheir responsibilities in a better manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang to clarify this point.

He should  ask  for  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the vote and not cut it down by $100!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the budget allocation\r\n\r\nfor  the  Foreign  Ministry for 1967,  an  increase  of\r\n\r\n$1,424,580 is voted over the 1966 budget. This House is\r\n\r\ngiven to understand that this increase is to facilitate\r\n\r\nthe  setting-up  of new embassies in  other  countries,\r\n\r\nincluding India and the United Arab Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that additional funds should be allocated to\r\n\r\nthe  Foreign Ministry. The Member for Bukit  Merah  has\r\n\r\nasked  why we should speak on a motion to cut down  the\r\n\r\nvote when we want to increase it. I understand that the\r\n\r\nparliamentary procedure is that we are not  allowed  to\r\n\r\nspeak  on  any item in the estimates unless we  move  a\r\n\r\nmotion to reduce the vote for that item.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that additional funds be given to the\r\n\r\nForeign  Ministry  so  that  more  embassies  could  be\r\n\r\nestablished in East European countries like Yugoslavia,\r\n\r\nBulgaria,  Rumania and Poland. I am wondering  why  the\r\n\r\nforeign Ministry has not made any provision for opening\r\n\r\nup  embassies in these countries - at least a  regional\r\n\r\nembassy   -   since  many  of  these   countries   have\r\n\r\nestablished  trade  relations  with  us.  We  know  our\r\n\r\nGovernment's neutral policy in the world power\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbloc  conflict. Our neutral and non-aligned  policy  is\r\n\r\nwise and timely. It is no exaggeration to say that  our\r\n\r\nneutral policy has gained more support and more friends\r\n\r\nin the world comity of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While suggesting that we open up an embassy in one of\r\n\r\nthe  East  European countries, like Poland,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nseriously intend to impede our non-alignment policy  or\r\n\r\nadvocate  that we should identify ourselves  more  with\r\n\r\nthe  Communist bloc countries. For that matter, I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  by  setting  up embassies in the United  Kingdom,\r\n\r\nBangkok,  Australia and New Zealand, we should  not  in\r\n\r\nany way be regarded as being pro-West. My suggestion is\r\n\r\nthat  by  opening  up  such embassies,  we  could  more\r\n\r\neffectively communicate with more countries in the East\r\n\r\nEuropean  bloc. I have no doubt this will be  practical\r\n\r\nand  even  more  beneficial to our  Republic.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, I am inclined to agree with the view expressed\r\n\r\nby   my  colleague,  the  Member  for  Ulu  Pandan,  in\r\n\r\nyesterday's  Budget debate. He correctly  said  that  a\r\n\r\ntrade mission should be set up in the People's Republic\r\n\r\nof  China in view of its market possibilities, in spite\r\n\r\nof the Finance Minister's statement on the imbalance of\r\n\r\ntrade between Singapore and China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Speaker in the Chair] </b></div>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Members will agree that the setting up of a trade\r\n\r\nmission  could well bring about a compromise that  this\r\n\r\nwill  even  up  the  trade.

We are at the\r\n\r\ncross-roads of the East and West, a metaphor  used  and\r\n\r\nacknowledged  by  both the Communists and  the  Western\r\n\r\nbloc  countries. If we could play host to the East  and\r\n\r\nWest  and if we could provide a neutral meeting  ground\r\n\r\nfor  these  countries, I should say  that  our  neutral\r\n\r\npolicy  will be more fruitful and beneficial, not  only\r\n\r\nto our two million people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  also to the 2,000 million people of the world.  \r\n\r\nIn short, Singapore can be the Geneva of the East.  \r\n\r\nSir,  I envisage that my suggestion in opening  up  an \r\n\r\nembassy  in  one  of the East European  countries  will\r\n\r\nexpand  our  scope  in trade and new  markets  for  our\r\n\r\nindustrial products. I request the Minister for Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs to give consideration to this matter. I support\r\n\r\nthis amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  have only one point to bring up. I would like to say\r\n\r\nthat  undoubtedly our foreign policy, particularly  the\r\n\r\nrecent  despatch of a delegation to the United Nations,\r\n\r\nhas  enhanced our reputation all over the world.  This,\r\n\r\nof  course, is a success of our foreign policy. But, on\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, I do not know whether the Minister has\r\n\r\nnoted  that  in  certain respects, we have  spoken  our\r\n\r\nminds  on  justice and righteousness. Some  businessmen\r\n\r\noutside  have  the  suspicion  that  a  country   which\r\n\r\nstresses non-alignment may be swayed from the middle to\r\n\r\nthe left. If that is the case, then Singapore, which is\r\n\r\nstressing    the   great   importance   of   industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   must  take  steps  to  clear   up   this\r\n\r\nsuspicion.  If  it still exists, then that  will  deter\r\n\r\nsome  foreign  investors from coming to  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nmake them hesitant in undertaking any enterprise. I  do\r\n\r\nnot know whether the Minister has noted this or whether\r\n\r\nhe  has heard anything of this nature. That is my point\r\n\r\non which I would like some clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S.

Thank you very much\r\n\r\nfor getting me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout of the predicament. But it is always helpful to get\r\n\r\npleas  for  an  increased allocation of  funds.  But  I\r\n\r\nthink,  to  be fair to the Finance Minister, the  funds\r\n\r\nhave  been accorded to suit the work that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  do  for the year 1967. If I had more  work,  more\r\n\r\nduties involved, I am quite sure he would have given it\r\n\r\nhis reasonable consideration. As you know, Sir, we have\r\n\r\nalready  indicated  that for  the  next  year  we  will\r\n\r\noperate  only  some nine to ten missions abroad.  There\r\n\r\nare  reasons for this. We can open up missions all over\r\n\r\nthe  place for prestige reasons, for political reasons.\r\n\r\nBut  in  Singapore we have decided that the only reason\r\n\r\nfor  opening up a mission anywhere is that we must  get\r\n\r\nsome  advantage out of it. We do not have  a  showpiece\r\n\r\neither  in  Europe or America or anywhere. Wherever  we\r\n\r\nopen  up a mission, we must be able to justify that  we\r\n\r\nget  some  benefit from it. So for the time being,  the\r\n\r\nsize  and  number of missions are determined purely  by\r\n\r\nthese  considerations. That would probably  answer  the\r\n\r\nobservations made also by the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from deciding what advantage Singapore would\r\n\r\nhave  in setting up a mission, we must find the finance\r\n\r\nto  set  it up. Missions are very expensive outfits  to\r\n\r\nmaintain, especially in countries where the standard of\r\n\r\nliving  is  considerably higher. So we cannot  disburse\r\n\r\nfunds  just  because it is good to have  a  mission  in\r\n\r\ncountry  A  or B until I can satisfy myself, and  quite\r\n\r\ndefinitely  satisfy the Finance Minister,  that  if  we\r\n\r\nspend  $2  million in such and such a country,  we  can\r\n\r\nexpect  to  get trade worth $4 million or  $5  million.\r\n\r\nThen  there is justification for it. Or some  political\r\n\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, there is the question of staff. One\r\n\r\npoint  we  must understand about Singapore in its  long\r\n\r\nhistory is that none of us has ever given consideration\r\n\r\nto  the possibility that an independent Singapore would\r\n\r\nhave  to train diplomatic personnel. It is only a  year\r\n\r\nsince  we became independent, and it takes a long  time\r\n\r\nto  train Foreign Office staff, or find people who  are\r\n\r\nprepared   to   head  missions,  to  be  diplomats   or\r\n\r\nambassadors in foreign countries, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  only the question of finding the money to  justify\r\n\r\nthe  setting-up  of  a  mission, but  the  question  of\r\n\r\nfinding the men to staff it. Being non-aligned, we  are\r\n\r\nnaturally  prepared  to  set  up  missions  in  Eastern\r\n\r\nEurope.  Western  Europe, Northern Europe  or  Southern\r\n\r\nEurope. But it must pass the criteria I have indicated.\r\n\r\nWhat benefit will Singapore get, whether it is economic\r\n\r\nor political! If there is no benefit, then we can carry\r\n\r\non  the  relationship in some other way. As  trade  and\r\n\r\nother  relationships increase sufficiently, the  moment\r\n\r\nwe  find enough staff to man the missions, we will give\r\n\r\nserious attention to the setting-up of missions abroad.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we have some trade missions from Eastern\r\n\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point by the Member for Sembawang is that we\r\n\r\ndo  not have enough protocol officers. True, we have  a\r\n\r\nsmall  number of protocol officers. That being  so,  we\r\n\r\nalways arrange things in such a way that not more  than\r\n\r\none  or two V.I.P.s visit Singapore at any given  time.\r\n\r\nIf a third V.I.P. intends and presses very hard to come\r\n\r\nto Singapore, we either politely tell him that maybe we\r\n\r\nwill be able to receive him the next month or the month\r\n\r\nafter that. So I think we can get by for the time being\r\n\r\nwith  the  number  of protocol officers  we  have.  But\r\n\r\nobviously  as  we  get  more experience,  as  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecomes  more popular with V.I.P.s, it may be necessary\r\n\r\nto consider increasing the number of protocol officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the choice of diplomats, we have not only\r\n\r\nchosen  commercial  men  - in fact,  I  think  we  have\r\n\r\ndeployed   the  talents  of  Singapore  in   a   rather\r\n\r\nrepresentative  way. We have commercial  men,  we  have\r\n\r\nprofessors,   we   have  professional   men,   ex-civil\r\n\r\nservants,  a  former Speaker, representing  practically\r\n\r\nmembers of all races and all classes. So I think  there\r\n\r\nis  nothing  wrong  in  appointing  commercial  men  or\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  as  diplomats, especially since  Singapore\r\n\r\nlives  on  commerce and trade. It may be  necessary  in\r\n\r\ncertain  areas, in certain countries, to have men  with\r\n\r\ntrading  knowledge. The work of a diplomat is not  only\r\n\r\nto have diplomacy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  to  give us information - information on economics\r\n\r\nand  other information. So in certain countries it  may\r\n\r\nbe necessary to have men experienced in trade, banking,\r\n\r\nbusiness and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the final point made by the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  that we should not discriminate against,  so\r\n\r\nto  speak,  Malay.  In fact, our hope  is  that  people\r\n\r\ncoming  into the Foreign Office not only speak  English\r\n\r\nand  Malay, but they should be able to speak French  or\r\n\r\nRussian  -  if  we should set up a mission  in  Russia.\r\n\r\nDefinitely  we  must be able to use  the  international\r\n\r\nlanguages. True, Malay is a good language,  but  it  is\r\n\r\nspoken  at the most by about 110 million people.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure that if you try to converse with a  Belgian\r\n\r\nor  a German in Malay, you will not get very far. So we\r\n\r\nwill  impress  on  people, especially  in  the  foreign\r\n\r\nservice,  which  is not set up for a national  outlook,\r\n\r\nthat it is not our national language that is important,\r\n\r\nbut  the language which is useful for a member  of  the\r\n\r\nforeign  service  to  have - one of  the  international\r\n\r\nlanguages. If Malay becomes an international  language,\r\n\r\nmaybe  then  a knowledge of Malay will be  one  of  the\r\n\r\nessentials of an employee of the Foreign Ministry.  But\r\n\r\nwe  have  people  who speak Malay. If  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  will  come  to  my Ministry,  he  will  find\r\n\r\nrecruits  who  are  Malays who speak Malay.  There  are\r\n\r\nrecruits who are not Malays who speak Malay. There  are\r\n\r\nalso Malays who speak English and so on. So there is no\r\n\r\nparticular  discrimination against any language  group.\r\n\r\nAll  that  we are interested in is that the  particular\r\n\r\nperson  can  discharge efficiently  the  functions  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities that go with the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for his explanation.

Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture and Social Affairs stated  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech on the opening of the National Language Campaign\r\n\r\nat  Pasir  Panjang Community Centre recently  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  at  the moment have no plans  to  redevelop\r\n\r\nAlsagoff Estate at Geylang. He was referring to current\r\n\r\nrumours  to the effect that the Government have  bought\r\n\r\nover  Alsagoff Estate for redevelopment  and  that  the\r\n\r\nresidents  of various races - the majority of  whom  are\r\n\r\nMalays - would have to be evicted from there. With  the\r\n\r\ndenial  made  by  the Minister for Culture  and  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs,  it  is clear that the rumours concerning  the\r\n\r\npurchase of Alsagoff Estate by the Government and  that\r\n\r\nthe  residents  are  to be evicted  are  falsehoods.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  they have been purposely cooked up by  parties\r\n\r\nwho  are  anti-Government and anti-national, to  create\r\n\r\nuneasiness  among the residents of Alsagoff Estate  for\r\n\r\ntheir own political ends. As such, I feel it is my duty\r\n\r\nto point out to the House how important it is that this\r\n\r\nmatter  be  brought  before  this  House  so  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister   concerned  and  other   hon.   Members   can\r\n\r\nunderstand the true position regarding Alsagoff  Estate\r\n\r\nin Geylang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From inquiries made by me and from statements in the\r\n\r\nUtusan Melayu of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28th  November, 1966, made by a member of the  Alsagoff\r\n\r\nfamily,  I  have come to understand - and I quote  from\r\n\r\nthe Utusan Melayu of 28th November, page 7, column 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Alsagoff Estate covering an area of about 850\r\n\r\nacres will be redeveloped as part of the urban area  of\r\n\r\nthe Republic in future. Subdivision will be carried out\r\n\r\nas soon as the parties concerned have approved the plan\r\n\r\nfor the said project.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And further the Utusan Melayu states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Groups of wealthy businessmen who are experienced and\r\n\r\nconversant  with matters concerning housing development\r\n\r\nare  ready to buy and redevelop the Geylang area  which\r\n\r\nis  congested,  and  that the whole  area  of  Alsagoff\r\n\r\nEstate  will  be subdivided into lots and  the  tenants\r\n\r\nhave  the  right  to  buy  up the  lots  as  their  own\r\n\r\nproperty.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if wealthy businessmen are going to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  the redevelopment of this area, their  main\r\n\r\nobjective is surely to enrich themselves. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  if  the plan is to be carried out by people  who\r\n\r\nare  not  of  the wealthy class, then their purpose  is\r\n\r\nsurely to deceive the poor people staying in the  area,\r\n\r\nand these are the people who will suffer hardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utusan Melayu in the same issue further states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All facilities such as good roads, proper drainage,\r\n\r\nbetter  supply  of  electricity, together  with  modern\r\n\r\nsanitation, will be provided,'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, if all this can be carried out, it is well\r\n\r\nand  good.  But  who will defray the expenses  for  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  those facilities? To my  knowledge,  the\r\n\r\norder  has  been  obtained to sell Alsagoff  Estate  at\r\n\r\nGeylang, also known as Perseverance Estate, an area  of\r\n\r\n850 acres, to Disco Limited of Penang for the sum of $5\r\n\r\nmillion, the method of payment being 20 per cent or  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  to  be  paid  as soon as the  layout  plan  is\r\n\r\napproved  by Government. After a year, 30 per  cent  or\r\n\r\n$1.5  million,  and after another year another  30  per\r\n\r\ncent  or $1.5 million, and after that the final payment\r\n\r\nof 20 per cent or $1 million will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have stated earlier, the order has\r\n\r\nbeen  obtained  for  the sale of the  Estate  to  Disco\r\n\r\nLimited.  But the forms circulated to the residents  of\r\n\r\nthe area are by Alsagoff Realty Limited,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose office is at U.M.N.O. House, Changi Road. Earlier\r\n\r\non, I  have quoted the Utusan Melayu of 28th  November\r\n\r\nwhich  states  that the whole area of  Alsagoff  Estate\r\n\r\nwill  be subdivided into lots and that the tenants have\r\n\r\nthe right to buy up the lots as their own property. But\r\n\r\nthe price and the method of payment are not made clear.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I am given to understand that the  method  of\r\n\r\npayment  is,  first a buyer pays $50 as  option  money.\r\n\r\nThen  he  has  to pay a deposit of 25 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nprice  which  has been fixed for a parcel  of  land  of\r\n\r\n6,000  square  feet in area at $2.20 per  square  foot.\r\n\r\nThis  could be paid in instalments spread over a period\r\n\r\nof  five years or ten years. But the roads and drainage\r\n\r\nmust be laid by the buyer. So if we are to consider the\r\n\r\nreport in the Utusan Melayu of 28th November, 1966, the\r\n\r\npicture one gets is attractive. All the more so as  the\r\n\r\nplan  is  to be carried out by Alsagoff Realty Limited,\r\n\r\nwhose  office  is  at U.M.N.O. House, No.  218E  Changi\r\n\r\nRoad.  The  reader may well expect that the company  is\r\n\r\nthat  of  the  Alsagoff  family and  U.M.N.O. must  be\r\n\r\nhelping  the  Malays. However, if we  ponder  over  the\r\n\r\nmatter  more  deeply, we find that the  sale  price  to\r\n\r\nDisco  Limited is $5 million for an area of 850  acres,\r\n\r\nwhich  works  out  to about 5\u00bd cents per  square  foot,\r\n\r\nwhereas the price to the residents is $2.20 per  square\r\n\r\nfoot  exclusive  of  expenses for roads  and  drainage.\r\n\r\nAnother  item of expenditure which would not  occur  to\r\n\r\nthe  residents is the cost of filling up  the  area  of\r\n\r\n6,000  square feet of land with earth, as the  area  is\r\n\r\nbelow sea level. Yet another item is the interest to be\r\n\r\ncharged  on  the instalments. If we add  up  all  these\r\n\r\nexpenses,  the price per square foot is not  less  than\r\n\r\n$3.50  or  more, while the purchase price from Alsagoff\r\n\r\nEstate is about 5\u00bd cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the case, Mr Speaker, I am most keen to\r\n\r\nknow whether Government will approve the application of\r\n\r\nDisco  Limited in respect of the layout plan which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  submitted to the relevant Government departments:\r\n\r\nfor  if this plan is approved, there may be poor Malays\r\n\r\nand  also  non-Malays living in the area  who  will  be\r\n\r\nexploited and victimised by a group of unscrupulous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwealthy  businessmen. So I trust  the  Government  will\r\n\r\ngive   every  possible  help  and  assistance  to   the\r\n\r\nresidents of the area to enable them to own the land by\r\n\r\ndirect purchase from the trustees of Alsagoff Estate at\r\n\r\na  price similar to if not less than that paid by Disco\r\n\r\nLimited. The residents of Alsagoff Estate are from  the\r\n\r\npoor  class  and it is only proper that  our  socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment give them every assistance so that they  are\r\n\r\nnot victimised by the capitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, because the matter raised by the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan refers to my constituency\r\n\r\n- Geylang Serai - I would like to clarify the position.\r\n\r\nAt  the  end  of  last month, a number of  people,  who\r\n\r\nclaimed  to be employees of Alsagoff Estate, went  from\r\n\r\nhouse  to  house  bringing  with  them  forms  for  the\r\n\r\npurchase of land in Geylang Serai. These people had  no\r\n\r\nproper  authority  from the owners of  the  land.  They\r\n\r\ninformed  the  residents  there  that  Alsagoff  Estate\r\n\r\nwished  to  sell the area to the residents  of  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai,  and that every resident had to buy the land  on\r\n\r\nwhich   he   was  staying,  whether  in  cash   or   in\r\n\r\ninstalments.  And the forms, according to them,  should\r\n\r\nbe returned to the office with $50 option money. When I\r\n\r\nmade  inquiries.  I  found  that  the  address  was  at\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. House, Changi Road. After investigations up to\r\n\r\nnow, I find there has not been a single official notice\r\n\r\nfrom the owners of the land to the residents of Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai. These people who claimed to be the employees  of\r\n\r\nAlsagoff  Estate had carried out false  propaganda  and\r\n\r\nsaid  that if the residents of Alsagoff Estate did  not\r\n\r\nbuy  up the land before 1968, Government would buy over\r\n\r\nthe  estate  and  build  flats.  I  believe  the  false\r\n\r\npropaganda spread by these people was carried out  with\r\n\r\nthe  evil intention of causing unrest among the  people\r\n\r\nof  Geylang  Serai. We must fight it.

House in Changi Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Minister for Culture and Social Affairs\r\n\r\nclarified  the  matter  in his  speech,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. issued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  statement in the Utusan Melayu stating that U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nheld   a  meeting  in  order  to  consider  the  matter\r\n\r\npertaining to Alsagoff Estate. This statement  has  confused the people of Geylang Serai, because U.M.N.O. has\r\n\r\ngiven  over  its office area to the people who  carried\r\n\r\nout  the  propaganda. And the statement issued  in  the\r\n\r\nUtusan  Melayu  was for the purpose of  clarifying  the\r\n\r\nmatter. However, with U.M.N.O. House being used  as  an\r\n\r\noffice  by  the organisation, U.M.N.O. has been  giving\r\n\r\nits  assistance to the people concerned,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nresidents  of Geylang Serai will dislike the Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. Firstly, it happened when Singapore  was\r\n\r\npart  of Malaysia. This group attempted to spread false\r\n\r\npropaganda,   allegedly  saying  that   the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment  would purchase the land in Alsagoff  Estate\r\n\r\nwhich  would  be  sold to the existing  settlers.  They\r\n\r\nfurther  alleged that residents who wished to  purchase\r\n\r\nthe  land  from  the  Malaysian  Government  should  be\r\n\r\nmembers  of U.M.N.O. This, Mr Speaker, clearly  proves\r\n\r\nthat Alsagoff Estate has become a political issue,  the\r\n\r\nobject  of  which  is  to create uneasiness  among  the\r\n\r\nMalays  in  Geylang Serai. It is hoped that the  proper\r\n\r\nauthorities will give due attention to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I will not take very long.

The area is heavily encumbered.  The\r\n\r\nowners themselves have no precise idea of the number of\r\n\r\nsquatters  and  ground tenants on  the  land.  In  many\r\n\r\ncases,  the areas have been sublet for a lump sum,  the\r\n\r\nsub-lessee renting the land and collecting ground  rent\r\n\r\nat  a  profit.  The buildings on the  land  are  mainly\r\n\r\ntemporary  structures owned by the ground  tenants.  Of\r\n\r\nthe  3,990 authorised houses in the area shown  on  the\r\n\r\nproperty tax rolls, 1,931 are owned by Malays and 2,065\r\n\r\nby  non-Malays who are mainly Chinese. These figures do\r\n\r\nnot  include  the  unauthorised or  unnumbered  houses\r\n\r\nwhich do not appear on the property tax records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1965, the solicitors for the Estate\r\n\r\npublished an advertisement in the Press  offering\r\n\r\nthe area for sale. It said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subject to existing tenancies and occupational\r\n\r\nrights, if any, part of the Estate, approximately\r\n\r\n410  acres, has been earmarked on the Master Plan\r\n\r\nas  Green Belt, but approval can be obtained  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment purposes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Planner drew the attention of the\r\n\r\nsolicitors  for  the Estate to the  advertisement\r\n\r\nand pointed out two points:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Permission for the development of half of\r\n\r\nPerseverance  Estate will not be granted  because\r\n\r\nof  the allocation of that half of the Estate  as\r\n\r\nGreen  Belt  and Public Open Space in the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Development of the remaining 480 acres\r\n\r\narea of the Estate, which is allocated\r\n\r\nfor residential use, may be considered by the competent\r\n\r\nauthority  on  an  application  being  made  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Planning Ordinance,  1959, but  in\r\n\r\nconsidering the application due regard\r\n\r\nmust be had by the competent authority 5 acres  to\r\n\r\nthe provisions of the Master Plan for\r\n\r\n3 acres   the   area   and   other  relevant   planning\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government has at various times given thought to\r\n\r\nthe acquisition of this Estate for development, but the\r\n\r\narea   presents  an  appalling  picture   of   squatter\r\n\r\ndifficulties and resettlement problem. The area in part\r\n\r\nis also low-lying and considerable filling and drainage\r\n\r\nwork  involving clearance will be necessary before  any\r\n\r\nconstruction can take place. This will inevitably  mean\r\n\r\nthe  removing and resiting of families now on the site.\r\n\r\nExcept  for  limited  development,  for  example,   the\r\n\r\nGeylang   Serai  Project  and  other  road  improvement\r\n\r\nschemes, etc., the acquisition of the entire Estate and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  development of the area  have  not  been\r\n\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is fully aware of the news carried\r\n\r\nby  the Utusan Melayu dated 5th December and I have the\r\n\r\nEnglish translation of it in hand. The news carried  is\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  one company by the  name  of  Alsagoff\r\n\r\nRealty  which has issued circulars to the residents  in\r\n\r\nAlsagoff Estate asking them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  buy  the land which they occupy at  $1.10  per\r\n\r\nsquare foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this stage, the Government, in fact, has\r\n\r\nno  plan  to  buy or acquire the land in  Alsagoff\r\n\r\nEstate.
