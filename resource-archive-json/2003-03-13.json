I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould like to discuss the policy of the civil service  in\r\n\r\nemploying   ex-offenders.   Every  year,   thousands   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are released from our penal institutions and\r\n\r\ndrug  rehabilitation centres.  I was told the number  was\r\n\r\nsome  9,500  last year.  They look forward to  rebuilding\r\n\r\nand  renewing  their lives.  A stable  job  will  greatly\r\n\r\nenhance their reintegration process.  In 2001, more  than\r\n\r\n1,500  offenders were assisted in getting  jobs,  all  of\r\n\r\nwhom  are  in  the private sector.  This certainly  shows\r\n\r\ntheir employment potential.  It also shows the gap in the\r\n\r\nnumber of people who are still seeking jobs.  Despite the\r\n\r\nsuccess,  many  more employers still hesitate  to  employ\r\n\r\nthese  ex-offenders; in my sense, this includes the civil\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the civil service is the employment arm of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  it plays a critical role in  sending  out  a\r\n\r\nclear  message  that  the  Government  believes  in   the\r\n\r\npotential  of  these ex-offenders in being  positive  and\r\n\r\ncontributing  members of society.  Opening the  doors  of\r\n\r\nemployment   opportunities  to   them   illustrates   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  willingness in giving second chances  -  an\r\n\r\nimportant   first  start  in  building  a   compassionate\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current economic climate makes it more\r\n\r\ndifficult for an ex-offender to secure a job.  It is with\r\n\r\nthis that I would like to ask the Prime Minister's Office\r\n\r\non the civil service's policy of employing ex-offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Ministries are given the discretion in\r\n\r\nemploying their own staff.  Does it include employing ex-offenders?  If so, how many ex-offenders have so far been\r\n\r\nemployed  by each of the different Ministries?  How  many\r\n\r\nhave  applied  but were not successful?   What  were  the\r\n\r\nreasons for their failure in securing employment  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil service?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said in this debate about the role of\r\n\r\nthe  civil service, its rigidity and bureaucracy.   Would\r\n\r\nsuch  rigidity and bureaucracy lead to conservative civil\r\n\r\nservants  leaning on the safe side, thus resulting  in  a\r\n\r\npreference  not  to  employ these  ex-offenders,  despite\r\n\r\nbeing able to do so?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every Singaporean matters\" - so says one of the S21\r\n\r\ntenets.    Another  says,  \"Opportunities  for   all\"   - certainly,    important   pillars   in    developing    a\r\n\r\ncompassionate, fair and resilient society.  The challenge\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government,  in  this case  through  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice, is to walk the talk.  I am confident the rest of\r\n\r\nthe private sector will quickly follow suit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nwith  your permission, may I address this House on  items\r\n\r\n(1)(b) and (c) together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, you may.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Much obliged. Sir, our\r\n\r\ncivil  service  is the backbone of the Government.   They\r\n\r\nhave  improved  over  the years and do  provide,  on  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  very  efficient service to  our  people,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould be proud of their capabilities and their just  and\r\n\r\nfair  dealings with the citizenry.  There should  not  be\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  amongst civil servants.   We  believe  in\r\n\r\nmeritocracy in school and working life and, therefore, it\r\n\r\nshould follow in the civil service too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, why should there be Article 111A in the\r\n\r\nform of Administrative Service Scheme of Service and  the\r\n\r\nAdministrative (Foreign Service) Scheme of  Service?   It\r\n\r\nis  a form of elitism within the civil service and it can\r\n\r\nbe  perceived as lacking in the concept of meritocracy in\r\n\r\nthe  pure  sense.  As and when a civil servant progresses\r\n\r\nin life, he or she should be judged by competency, and  a\r\n\r\npublic officer must be treated equally and given an equal\r\n\r\nopportunity to excel, notwithstanding he or she may be  a\r\n\r\nsecondary,  junior college or general degree  holder,  or\r\n\r\nfirst-class honours, masters or Ph.D graduate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once he or she comes into the working world, the\r\n\r\npromotion prospects must be based on merit, both in terms\r\n\r\nof  ability,  personality  and  the  handling  of  life's\r\n\r\nproblems and coming up with solutions as a whole.  Should\r\n\r\nwe  therefore remove the categorisation of civil servants\r\n\r\ninto  Administrative Service and the rest  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice?   My  query, Sir, is the necessity for  dividing\r\n\r\nthe civil service, wittingly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  unwittingly,  and  the  Administrative  Service,  and\r\n\r\nwhether   civil  servants  are  discriminated  in   their\r\n\r\npromotion prospects, although they may not express it  so\r\n\r\nopenly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other query, Sir, is whether there is a strategic\r\n\r\nplanning  exercise, say, every three to  five  years,  to\r\n\r\nassess   the  quality  and  quantity  of  civil  servants\r\n\r\nrequired  by our country.  And do we have too many  civil\r\n\r\nservants today?  If so, should this be remedied?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution of the Republic of Singapore\r\n\r\nprovides  in  Part  IX,  Articles  102-119,  the   public\r\n\r\nservices  of Singapore.  The public services  consist  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Armed Forces, the Singapore Civil Service,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Legal Service, and the  Singapore  Police\r\n\r\nForce.    Article  105  provides  for  a  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  consisting of a Chairman and  not  less  than\r\n\r\nfive and not more than 14 other members appointed by  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  Singapore.  And Article 107 provides  that\r\n\r\nthe  tenure  of  office  of every member  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission shall serve five years and may be  re-appointed.   My  question, Sir, is  this.   Should  these\r\n\r\nappointments be constantly reviewed so that the best  and\r\n\r\nmost  capable people, and with sufficient time  and  keen\r\n\r\ninterest,  be  appointed?  What is the best or  preferred\r\n\r\ncriterion to decide these?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to give an opportunity to more people, who\r\n\r\nare  qualified and capable, to offer fresh ideas  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission (PSC), should there be a cap on\r\n\r\nthe  term of service of PSC members to a maximum  of  one\r\n\r\nterm  or  five  years?  Also, should the  tenure  of  the\r\n\r\nChairman  or Deputy Chairman be up to a maximum of  three\r\n\r\nyears,  so  that  there is fresh blood  and  rotation  of\r\n\r\nchairmanship and, therefore, opportunity given to  others\r\n\r\nto take on leadership roles?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Article 111 of the Constitution provides for a\r\n\r\nLegal  Service Commission (LSC).  Whilst there  are  very\r\n\r\ndistinguished people and a good mix of people in the  PSC\r\n\r\nand  the Legal Service Commission, it could be said  that\r\n\r\nthe  composition of the LSC might not have a good mix  of\r\n\r\npersons\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the legal fraternity, ie, lawyers from the NUS  Law\r\n\r\nFaculty,  the  Law  Society of Singapore  and  the  legal\r\n\r\nfraternity  as a whole.  Would the Government, therefore,\r\n\r\nconsider  revamping  the  composition  of  the   LSC   to\r\n\r\nincorporate  a better mix amongst members  in  the  legal\r\n\r\nfraternity?   We could have, for instance,  the  Dean  of\r\n\r\nLaw,   the  President  of  the  Law  Society,  or   their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, as representatives of the LSC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please wind up your speech, Mr Mohan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Yes, Sir. The LSC could\r\n\r\nbe  expanded  to  include two new  members,  besides  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  LSC  members, comprising the Chief Justice,  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General, the Chairman of PSC,  a  Judge  of  the\r\n\r\nSupreme  Court and two members of PSC.  In  this  way,  a\r\n\r\ngood  feel  and  feedback of the whole  legal  fraternity\r\n\r\ncould  be  better obtained and it could be said that  the\r\n\r\nlegal service officers, who also include magistrates  and\r\n\r\ndistrict  judges appointments, and their  promotions  are\r\n\r\nconsidered by a better spread of citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, my view is that, as far as possible,\r\n\r\nthe  people's voice and representations must be respected\r\n\r\nand  allow to come to fruition wherever possible, so that\r\n\r\nthere is a good synergy and symbiosis of minds and hearts\r\n\r\nof  the  people  in  high  office  and  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in a downturn,\r\n\r\nevery  company  takes  the  opportunity  to  restructure,\r\n\r\nreorganise    and   re-strategise.    So,    for    many,\r\n\r\nrestructuring exercise is not an option, but a matter  of\r\n\r\nsurvival.    The  Deputy  Prime  Minister  talked   about\r\n\r\ncreating  an  entrepreneurial  civil  service.   While  I\r\n\r\napplaud  this  initiative,  I  however  do  not  see  any\r\n\r\nrecommendations in the ERC or the Budget on how he  plans\r\n\r\nto achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to talk about three areas on this\r\n\r\namendment.   First, cost-cutting; second, improvement  in\r\n\r\nthe efficiency and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproductivity of Ministries and Government agencies;  and,\r\n\r\nthird,   how   the   civil  service   can   become   more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of cost-cutting, I feel that it is\r\n\r\nappropriate for the Government to review the salaries and\r\n\r\ncompensation  of  Ministers and top civil  servants,  not\r\n\r\njust  the  30%  cut that Mr Steve Chia talked  about.   I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is no simple thing.  When we structured  the\r\n\r\nsalary  system, it was in times when economic growth  was\r\n\r\nvery  high.  And we realise now that it is not  going  to\r\n\r\ncome anymore.  What has happened now is that we have  got\r\n\r\na  system where, instead of following the private  sector\r\n\r\nbenchmark,  it  is setting a benchmark  for  the  private\r\n\r\nsector, so much so that it leads to higher cost of hiring\r\n\r\ntalents in the private sector.  I think it is about  time\r\n\r\nthat we took the opportunity to review the system so that\r\n\r\nit  does not create the kind of pressure that the current\r\n\r\nsalary system is creating.  While the Government has been\r\n\r\nsuccessful in attracting talent, having high salaries,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  net  impact on the private  sector  is  quite\r\n\r\ndetrimental.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of cost-cutting is on how operating\r\n\r\ncosts like rentals, utilities and services bought by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could be brought down.  Many a  time  when  I\r\n\r\nvisit  Government  offices I  see  the  luxury  of  these\r\n\r\noffices  -  the  big  spaces,  the  nice  furniture   and\r\n\r\nfittings.  I think we need to scale back and go  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  basics  of  what are the functional  uses  of  these\r\n\r\nthings.  Thirdly, reorganisation of the civil service and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  -  to regroup, to outsource,  to  reduce\r\n\r\nsizes of the various agencies.\r\n\r\n<br>11.15 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the issue of an entrepreneurial civil\r\n\r\nservice, while I agree with the move, I think it is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  that, if you want to support a  pro-enterprise\r\n\r\nenvironment,  I  have  some ideas  for  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider.   First  of  all,  we  need  to  give   greater\r\n\r\ndiscretion to the officers at all levels.  The complaints\r\n\r\nthat  we see from the private sector all the time is that\r\n\r\nofficers dare not make decisions because they are  afraid\r\n\r\nof making mistakes.  And\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey would rather err on the conservative side because of\r\n\r\nhow  the reward and recognition system works in the civil\r\n\r\nservice.  We should allow them to have more flexibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, build in some grey areas in legislation so\r\n\r\nthat  there  is sufficient flexibility when it  comes  to\r\n\r\nimplementing   rules   and  regulations.    The   current\r\n\r\nmentality  of trying to plug all possible loopholes  does\r\n\r\nnot help when we try to encourage people to think out  of\r\n\r\nthe   box.    The   fear  of  going  against   regulation\r\n\r\ndiscourages the spirit of enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is to give some time off for\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  to  participate in  outside  activities,\r\n\r\nincluding  being involved in consultancies  and  business\r\n\r\nactivities,  as long as they make proper declarations  of\r\n\r\nwhat they are up to.  One way to encourage this is to pay\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  only nine months of the salary  and  let\r\n\r\nthem  earn the rest of it through consultancy.   I  think\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education is practising this for some  of\r\n\r\nits teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, a reward system which recognises people\r\n\r\nwho  are  willing  to think out of the box,  rather  than\r\n\r\nrewarding people for conformity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, the secondment of civil servants to\r\n\r\nprivate  companies with some performance  measures  which\r\n\r\nshould  add  to  the assessment of the  long-term  career\r\n\r\npotential  of the person seconded.  If their  performance\r\n\r\nin  the  private sector becomes an important  measure  of\r\n\r\ntheir  ability, I am sure they will seriously learn about\r\n\r\nwhat it takes to make the private sector tick, and skills\r\n\r\nwhich  will be useful for them when they return  back  as\r\n\r\ncivil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am convinced that the political leadership\r\n\r\nand  top  civil servants are enlightened on the  need  to\r\n\r\nsupport  and encourage private enterprise down  the  line\r\n\r\nand  down the ranks - you have heard from many Members  - the  motivation  is not the same, and we  say  this  from\r\n\r\npersonal experience.  I hope that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggestions  I  have will help to change the  mindset  of\r\n\r\ncivil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, the issue that I\r\n\r\nam  raising is not a new one.  I think it has been raised\r\n\r\nin  many  Budget debates before and I also raised  it  in\r\n\r\nlast  year's  Budget debate.  I think  everyone  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse has probably heard all the arguments, all the trite\r\n\r\narguments and all the trite responses.  The reason why it\r\n\r\ncontinues  to be raised is because the issue  itself  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  resolved.  The issue is one of inequality  and\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against female civil servants, in terms of\r\n\r\nthe medical benefits that they are entitled to enjoy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I am raising it again this year is\r\n\r\nbecause we have been given some hope by the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  last year when, in the Budget debate,  he  said\r\n\r\nthat the whole thing is not set in concrete and the civil\r\n\r\nservice   will   continue  to  review  the   MSO   scheme\r\n\r\nperiodically,  as  our  society evolves.   I  think  this\r\n\r\nstatement has given some hope, in fact, a lot of hope  to\r\n\r\nall the female civil servants and female parliamentarians\r\n\r\nand,  I hope, all the male parliamentarians in this House\r\n\r\nas  well who have been hearing this debate over and  over\r\n\r\nagain for many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the argument that is used here is that the\r\n\r\nnorms  in the civil service should not change, if society\r\n\r\nhas  not  changed  its  norms.   But  social  norms  have\r\n\r\nchanged.   In the old days, girls did not go  to  school,\r\n\r\nwomen  did  not  work and, in the Chinese community,  the\r\n\r\ntradition of feet-binding prevailed.  But today, girls go\r\n\r\nto  school, and the Compulsory Education Act even compels\r\n\r\nthem  to  do  so, and large numbers of women are  in  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.    In   fact,   the   female   labour    force\r\n\r\nparticipation rate today is 54%.  Therefore, one comes to\r\n\r\nthe conclusion that the only feet-binding that remains is\r\n\r\nin  the  mindset  of the Government with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nextension  of  the  medical  benefits  to  female   civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been hearing about this word \"mindset\"\r\n\r\nfor  a  very long time.  In fact, over the last few days,\r\n\r\nthe words \"mindset change\" have been mentioned\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  50 times.  So I hope that there will be a  mindset\r\n\r\nchange  on the part of the Government.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nargue    that    this   is   inequitable,   unfair    and\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory.   In  this sense, it  also  devalues  the\r\n\r\ncontributions  of women.  And I must say that  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice has been exemplary because the first employer  to\r\n\r\nstart  with the equal pay for equal work policy  in  1962\r\n\r\nwas  the civil service, and not the private sector.  That\r\n\r\nwas  a  huge  milestone, and it set a very  clear  public\r\n\r\npolicy  of  what  to expect on how the  female  workforce\r\n\r\nshould  be treated.  The civil service is also exemplary,\r\n\r\nin  terms of the benefits it provides for the family, the\r\n\r\nextended  childcare leave and paid sick leave for  taking\r\n\r\ncare  of  young  children, and so on.   So  I  hope  this\r\n\r\nexemplary  behaviour  of  the  civil  service  would   be\r\n\r\nextended  to the last bastion of inequality and it  would\r\n\r\nbe  removed.  And I must argue in particular that if  the\r\n\r\ncivil service could ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could you keep your arguments short,\r\n\r\nMdm Halimah?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Yes, Sir. On MSO, I must argue\r\n\r\nfrom   another  angle,  ie,  hardship.  In  the   current\r\n\r\nemployment situation when husbands are expected  to  lose\r\n\r\ntheir jobs more frequently, the money can be used to take\r\n\r\ncare  of,  maybe not the sick husband, but at  least  the\r\n\r\nsick  child,  this will reduce hardship.  Also,  when  it\r\n\r\ngoes back to the Medisave account, she can use it for her\r\n\r\nhusband  and her children.  But for outpatient treatment,\r\n\r\nshe cannot use it.  The logic seems to be inconsistent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I do appeal, once again, on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of the civil servants, to review this policy  and\r\n\r\nto extend equality to all the civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, one of the core\r\n\r\nbeliefs of the Singapore civil service, as stipulated  on\r\n\r\nits website, is that change is essential for continuously\r\n\r\nmaintaining   and  improving  Singapore's   international\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in a global economy.  No doubt,  we  have\r\n\r\nembraced change to meet the fast pace of regional\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  international transformation.  However, we must also\r\n\r\nask: are we changing for the sake of changing?  Are there\r\n\r\ncivil servants in leadership position to initiate changes\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake of changing to impress or to illustrate  a\r\n\r\ndifferent   track  taken,  compared   to   his   or   her\r\n\r\npredecessors  in  order to show that  he  is  performing,\r\n\r\ncreative and innovative?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that, currently, civil servants who are\r\n\r\ndeemed to be of leadership potential are moved around  to\r\n\r\nhead  different  departments, as  part  of  their  career\r\n\r\ndevelopment  path.   Each  of  their  new  posting   will\r\n\r\nprobably last about two years.  The result is that  these\r\n\r\nsenior  civil servants will make changes when  they  head\r\n\r\nthe  department.  Then they are moved out two years  down\r\n\r\nthe  road,  sometimes even before knowing  the  practical\r\n\r\nresult  of the changes that they have implemented.   When\r\n\r\nanother  new  department head takes  over,  then  another\r\n\r\nround of change will commence.  This has resulted in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle and lower level civil servants having to cope with\r\n\r\nchanges  and  wonder what will follow.  Does this  affect\r\n\r\nthe  morale of the middle and lower-rank officers and the\r\n\r\ncontinuity of the civil service?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern, Sir, is continuity and experience\r\n\r\nof  top  personnel heading the key services, such as  the\r\n\r\nmilitary service.  I note that the top positions  in  the\r\n\r\nmilitary  service,  such as the Chief of  Defence  Force,\r\n\r\nChief of Army, Navy, etc, have been changing quite often.\r\n\r\nI  think personnel in key positions should be given  more\r\n\r\ntime  in a particular post in order to gain the necessary\r\n\r\nexperience.   I  believe  that,  at  times   of   crisis,\r\n\r\nexperience counts a lot on how and what to respond.  I am\r\n\r\nof  the view that the Government should be concerned with\r\n\r\ncultivating  the experience of key senior civil  servants\r\n\r\nand  the  continuity  of the civil  service.

Is\r\n\r\nthere  a report of the workings of the CPIB available  to\r\n\r\nParliament like many other reports?  I perused the report\r\n\r\nof the Ministry of Home Affairs for the year 2002, but  I\r\n\r\ncould  not  find anything on the CPIB -  I  stand  to  be\r\n\r\ncorrected here - but I could not find it.  It only  talks\r\n\r\nabout our own Home Team's department, which includes  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Police Force, Singapore Civil  Defence  Force,\r\n\r\nPrisons   Department,   Central  Narcotics   Bureau   and\r\n\r\nSingapore  Immigration and Registration and the statutory\r\n\r\nboards   -   the   Commercial  and  Industrial   Security\r\n\r\nCorporation  and Singapore Corporation of  Rehabilitative\r\n\r\nEnterprises.

The\r\n\r\ncivil service does indeed employ people who have criminal\r\n\r\nrecords.   So  far, 11 persons with criminal  convictions\r\n\r\nhave  been employed - four in the Prisons Department,  as\r\n\r\npart-time   tutor  and  as  corporate  support   officers\r\n\r\nhandling  administrative work;   two  are  in  the  Civil\r\n\r\nDefence;   three are with the Police Force, in  positions\r\n\r\nof   security  screening  officers,  mechanic  and   tool\r\n\r\nattendant; and two more are operational support  officers\r\n\r\nwith MOE performing attendant duties.  I am glad to learn\r\n\r\nthat  they  are all performing and contributing  well  in\r\n\r\ntheir jobs.   I do not know how many were unsuccessful or\r\n\r\nwhy.  They could have been unsuccessful for any number of\r\n\r\nreasons,   quite  likely  unrelated  to  their   criminal\r\n\r\nbackgrounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recruitment into the civil service is based on\r\n\r\nthe   principles  of  meritocracy,  incorruptibility  and\r\n\r\nimpartiality.  It is the Ministries who are in  the  best\r\n\r\nposition  to  make informed decisions on the requirements\r\n\r\nof  the  jobs  and  the  type of jobs  suitable  for  the\r\n\r\napplicants.   So we leave it to the Ministries  and  give\r\n\r\nthem  the  freedom  and flexibility to  select  the  best\r\n\r\ncandidate for the job, taking into consideration the  job\r\n\r\ndemands  and how suitable the candidate is.  This applies\r\n\r\nto  everybody, including ex-offenders.  So I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  leaving  recruitment decisions to  Ministries  will\r\n\r\nmake  civil servants more rigid and conservative.  I also\r\n\r\ndo  not think it will be an improvement to have a central\r\n\r\noffice for recruitment of offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan asked about the Administrative\r\n\r\nService  being given special privileges.   There  are  no\r\n\r\nspecial  privileges, nor discrimination.  The Article  of\r\n\r\nthe   Constitution  he  cited,  Article  111A,  does  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  for  or against civil servants.   It  is  a\r\n\r\ncontrol mechanism. We have devolved powers over personnel\r\n\r\nmatters, which used to be very centralised in the  Public\r\n\r\nService Commission, to a system of Personnel Boards  -  a\r\n\r\nSpecial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel Board at the top and Senior and other Personnel\r\n\r\nBoards  in  each  Ministry - to look  after  recruitment,\r\n\r\npromotion,  postings,  and  so  on.  To  maintain  system\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  at  the very top we did not  devolve  powers\r\n\r\nover  the  Administrative Service and the  Administrative\r\n\r\nService  (Foreign Service Branch). And the non-devolution\r\n\r\nis  safeguarded in the Constitution.  Article 111A merely\r\n\r\nsays   that,   above  the  Significant   Grade   in   the\r\n\r\nAdministrative Service, the powers shall remain with  the\r\n\r\nPSC and cannot be devolved to a Personnel Board.\r\n\r\n<br>11.30 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Article 111A is a control mechanism, not a\r\n\r\ndiscrimination    mechanism.     Admission    into    the\r\n\r\nAdministrative Service is by merit.  Many come in at  the\r\n\r\nstart.   Along the way, we try very hard to  find  people\r\n\r\nwho  are suitable, either in service or even outside  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service,  to be recruited into the  Administrative\r\n\r\nService mid-career. We have some modest success.  So, you\r\n\r\nare  only  in as long as you measure up, and anybody  who\r\n\r\nmeasures up can come in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no special criteria for being a member of\r\n\r\nthe  Public Service Commission.  The most important thing\r\n\r\nis  that,  first,  you  must  be  prepared  to  make  the\r\n\r\ncommitment  of  time and effort, because it  is  quite  a\r\n\r\nheavy  job.  Secondly,  you must have  a  good  feel  for\r\n\r\npeople,   understanding  their  motivations,  recognising\r\n\r\ntheir  abilities  and  where they will  be  best  fitted,\r\n\r\nassessing  whether they merit promotion or  whether  they\r\n\r\nshould be disciplined.  That is not just IQ but also  EQ,\r\n\r\nand a combination of these two attributes is very hard to\r\n\r\nfind.   The  Chairman,  Dr Andrew Chew,  who  has  served\r\n\r\nalmost  a  term,  constantly looks  for  people  who  are\r\n\r\nsuitable for this job.  He tests them out, puts them onto\r\n\r\nscholarship boards and interview panels.  And after  some\r\n\r\ntime,  when  he  has a good assessment of them,  he  puts\r\n\r\ntheir  names up, and it goes to the Cabinet and then  the\r\n\r\nPresident for decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are always looking for names. There is not a\r\n\r\nqueue of suitable people waiting their turn to be on  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  Commission.  So, I do not  think  having\r\n\r\nterm limits of one term of five years is going to help us\r\n\r\nhave  a better Public Service Commission.  It is good  to\r\n\r\nhave  some turnover but, at the same time, we have to  be\r\n\r\nrealistic  whom  we  can have on this Commission  who  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  add  value.  And, all the  more,  it  is  very\r\n\r\ndemanding  to  be  the  Chairman of  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.  To propose a term limit of three  years  and\r\n\r\none term is not a realistic approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Legal Service Commission, the system has\r\n\r\nworked  well.   The requirements really  are  similar  to\r\n\r\nthose for the Public Service Commission, except that  you\r\n\r\nneed  some additional legal inputs which are provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Justice and another Judge.  The rest  of  the\r\n\r\nLegal  Service  Commission comprises the Chairman  and  a\r\n\r\ncouple of members of the Public Service Commission, and I\r\n\r\nthink that is a good way to work.  I do not know what the\r\n\r\nPresident  of  the  Law  Society  would  bring   to   the\r\n\r\nCommission,  because you should not  be  there  just  ex-officio.   We  need people who can add  value,  can  make\r\n\r\ncontribution  and are in a position to  judge.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is  what the Legal Service Commission provides,  as\r\n\r\npresently constituted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh talked about how public sector\r\n\r\nsalaries  have now become the benchmarks for the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  because we set our salaries at a time  when  the\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  was high, and now economic  growth  has\r\n\r\ncome down and private sector salaries have gone down.   I\r\n\r\nthink he is wrong on several counts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, private-sector salaries have not really\r\n\r\ngone  down  that  much.  If we look at  incomes  -  as  I\r\n\r\nexplained  yesterday - they in fact went up  by  1%  last\r\n\r\nyear  across the board on average, although I acknowledge\r\n\r\nthat starting salaries in certain spots have gone down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the top, the public sector salaries do\r\n\r\nnot set the pace.  We have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  system which is benchmarked to the private sector, but\r\n\r\nat  a  significant  discount -  two-thirds  the  private-sector, at the top.  As salaries in the private sector go\r\n\r\nup,  so do the civil service and the Ministers'.  As when\r\n\r\nthose  in the private sector go down, so do we.  In fact,\r\n\r\nover  the  last  few  years, we  have  not  followed  the\r\n\r\nbenchmark, because we have frozen public sector salaries.\r\n\r\nPresently, public sector salaries at the top are only 60%\r\n\r\nof  what the benchmark should be.  This means that if  we\r\n\r\ntake two-thirds of the average private sector salaries as\r\n\r\nthe  benchmark  - which is where we ought to be - we  are\r\n\r\nonly at 60% of the benchmark. So, we are quite far behind\r\n\r\nwhere  we  ought to be. We are not making  an  adjustment\r\n\r\nnow.  And we are not setting the pace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On individual services, there could well be some\r\n\r\npoints where we have not adjusted downwards, and this  we\r\n\r\nwill review and stay in line with the market. There is no\r\n\r\nneed  for us to pay out of line with the market and  push\r\n\r\ncost up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxurious Government offices are a subject which was\r\n\r\nraised  last  year by Mr Tan Soo Khoon and discussed.   I\r\n\r\nassure  Members  that  we  have standards  to  keep  them\r\n\r\nfunctional  and adequate, but not excessive.  After  last\r\n\r\nyear's discussion, I had a look at the norms again and we\r\n\r\ntightened up the norms, and brought down the average cost\r\n\r\nper square metre which we allow for Government buildings.\r\n\r\nAlso,  the  budgeting process has been tightened  up,  so\r\n\r\nthat  if in the course of the tender it turns out  to  be\r\n\r\ncheaper  than expected, we then work with that  new  cap,\r\n\r\nrather than use the savings for some other facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would say that when we visit the Ministry\r\n\r\nbuildings - and perhaps we ought to organise a  tour  for\r\n\r\nMPs  who have an interest in this subject  - such as  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  of  Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs,  Education\r\n\r\nand so on, we will find that they are not luxurious.  The\r\n\r\nofficers work in open plan offices, with standard modular\r\n\r\nfurniture.    There  are  no  chandeliers  or   expensive\r\n\r\nexcrescences and expressions.  They are meant to serve  a\r\n\r\nfunction, but they are presentable because\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are  built for the long term.  We are not going  to\r\n\r\nrebuild them in 20 years, and they have to last.  So, the\r\n\r\nstandard  is adequate and I think it is about  right.   I\r\n\r\nhave some interest in this because I have been to several\r\n\r\nbuildings,  and  sometimes it turned out  more  than  you\r\n\r\nexpected,  sometimes it turned out  less  than  you  have\r\n\r\nexpected.  But all civil servants know that they gain  no\r\n\r\nbrownie points by ending up with a palace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for an entrepreneurial civil service, this also\r\n\r\nhas  been discussed at length over the last few days.   I\r\n\r\nam   not   in  favour  of  building  in  grey  areas   in\r\n\r\nlegislation. Legislation has to be clear.  We need not go\r\n\r\ninto excruciating details, but the principles have to  be\r\n\r\nclear.   Because  the more grey areas we have,  the  more\r\n\r\ndiscretion we leave to the officer on the spot, the  more\r\n\r\ndisputes  and  difficulties we will have in  implementing\r\n\r\nthe  law, and  the more room and temptation there is  for\r\n\r\nthe officer to do something not quite proper.  The way to\r\n\r\nhave  a  clean system which is easy for people to operate\r\n\r\nis  to have as few rules as possible, but the rules which\r\n\r\nwe have will have to be clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying officers nine months' salary out of 12 to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in outside activities is, I  think,  a  very\r\n\r\ninteresting idea.  Perhaps we should start it at the  top\r\n\r\nwith  the Ministers!  It may be possible only in  certain\r\n\r\njobs.  If  you are an academic, you are paid nine  months\r\n\r\nout   of   12,  and  the  other  three  months   you   do\r\n\r\nconsultation,  that  is possible.  If  you  are  Managing\r\n\r\nDirector of MAS and three months of the year you  go  and\r\n\r\nbe  a  private  sector  banker, I think  that  may  cause\r\n\r\ncertain   complications.   So,   it   is   not   such   a\r\n\r\nstraightforward idea.  But we are keen on having  a  flow\r\n\r\nwith  the private sector.  We do second people to private\r\n\r\nsector  organisations, such as McKinsey, SIA,  Shell,  to\r\n\r\ngive  them the exposure and the understanding of how  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector works, so that when they come  back  they\r\n\r\nare better for it.  And the opposite too.  We have people\r\n\r\nseconded from the private sector into the Government,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they understand how we work and they know that when\r\n\r\nwe do something there is a reason for our actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah Yacob talked about medical benefits.\r\n\r\nShe   knows  my  arguments.   It  is  not  a  matter   of\r\n\r\nefficiency.   It  is a matter of values and  setting  the\r\n\r\ntone.  As I said, it is not cast in stone, and it is  not\r\n\r\na  matter  where  everybody  has  the  same  fixed  view.\r\n\r\nDifferent   people   have  different   views.    As   the\r\n\r\ncomposition of Parliament changes and that of the Cabinet\r\n\r\nchanges,  these views gradually shift, and the  consensus\r\n\r\nshifts.   The  Cabinet discussed this very seriously,  at\r\n\r\nleast  once  per  term  of office,  sometimes  twice.  We\r\n\r\nrecently discussed it, and there is not yet a majority in\r\n\r\nfavour  of changing.  There is a significant minority  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers in favour of changing - I cannot  say  who\r\n\r\nbecause we have collective responsibility - but it is not\r\n\r\na  unanimous view, because the younger ones feel that  we\r\n\r\nought  to move with the times, and the older ones  prefer\r\n\r\nto move a little bit slower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And she knows who!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Senior Minister also has\r\n\r\nsome views on this matter!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly one day when we have ladies in Cabinet,\r\n\r\nthey  will likely to make very strong arguments,  and  we\r\n\r\nwill discuss this issue again.  So, it is something which\r\n\r\nis gradually evolving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked whether we are changing for\r\n\r\nthe  sake of changing, and posting people around too fast\r\n\r\n-  every  two years - and if we are doing things just  to\r\n\r\nhave a splash.  He has a point. We do not want people who\r\n\r\nare  just punching their tickets and saying, \"I have been\r\n\r\nhere, and here, and here.\"  But, at the same time, we  do\r\n\r\nwant  people who have had a broad range of exposure.   If\r\n\r\nthey  are  in  the  Ministry of  Finance  overseeing  the\r\n\r\ncollection of revenue, it is also good for them  to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in the Ministry of Defence or the Ministry of Trade\r\n\r\nand Industry, where they are responsible for spending the\r\n\r\nmoney.   So they know how difficult it is to collect  the\r\n\r\nmoney  and  at the same time, they know how careful  they\r\n\r\nhave to be when they spend it, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvice  versa.  So, we do need people with a certain  range\r\n\r\nof exposure and we post people around to achieve that.  I\r\n\r\nthink  on  balance  we have reasonable stability  in  our\r\n\r\nsystem  and  in our policies.  Indeed, I have  not  heard\r\n\r\nMembers  complaining about policies changing too quickly.\r\n\r\nUsually,  the complaint is that the policies  change  too\r\n\r\nslowly.  But it is a balance which we have to continue to\r\n\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the SAF top positions going around too\r\n\r\nquickly,  this  question ought  to  be  directed  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Defence in his Committee of Supply cut later\r\n\r\non.  I  am  speaking  not on behalf of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence but on first principles.  Every defence force has\r\n\r\nthis  problem.  They want able people at the top  and  at\r\n\r\nseveral  levels down.  But if the top does not turn-over,\r\n\r\nthe people below will not stay.  They will leave, because\r\n\r\nthey  feel  they are ready, but cannot move up.   On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, if the top changes too quickly, then, after a\r\n\r\nwhile,  none  of  them  leaves  an  impression  and   the\r\n\r\norganisation  is just a succession of names and  pictures\r\n\r\non  the wall.  So, how to have a balance so that we  have\r\n\r\ngood  Chiefs  and, at the same time, good staff  officers\r\n\r\nand  good  commanders who can see reasonable  progression\r\n\r\nahead  of  them and that progression is not just  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of dead men's shoes?  That is a balance which  the\r\n\r\nSAF  is trying to strike.  If we judge by the quality  of\r\n\r\nthe people in the SAF, we have done quite well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chandra Mohan Nair asked why the CPIB is\r\n\r\nin  Prime  Minister's Office and not in the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome Affairs.  First of all, CPIB officers are not police\r\n\r\nofficers.   They  may be seconded, but  it  is  the  CPIB\r\n\r\nscheme of service which services the CPIB.  And the  CPIB\r\n\r\nhas  to  report to the Prime Minister because  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is responsible for the integrity of  the  whole\r\n\r\ncivil  service, the public sector, as well as the  Judges\r\n\r\nand  the Ministers.  It is his responsibility to keep the\r\n\r\nsystem  clean.   If he does not, and we  have  a  corrupt\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, then we are in serious trouble.  We  have\r\n\r\nsafeguarded   that   situation,   because    under    the\r\n\r\nConstitution if the Prime Minister would not  give  leave\r\n\r\nto  the  CPIB to pursue a case, the CPIB can  go  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident, and the President can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive  leave to proceed.  So, even the Prime Minister  can\r\n\r\nbe  investigated.  But that is an extreme  situation.   I\r\n\r\nthink we have to work on a system where we make sure that\r\n\r\nwe  have a Prime Minister who is absolutely reliable and,\r\n\r\nfurthermore,  who  has the guts and the determination  to\r\n\r\npolice the whole system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the CPIB putting out a public report, I think\r\n\r\nit  is a good idea.  In fact, CPIB does prepare an annual\r\n\r\nreport  which is circulated to the Cabinet. We will  look\r\n\r\ninto how we can prepare a version of the report which can\r\n\r\nbe  published and tabled in Parliament so that  everybody\r\n\r\ncan  see  what they have done, what the trends  are,  and\r\n\r\nwhether the numbers have gone up or gone down.  I do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  numbers with me today, but you will know  what\r\n\r\nthey  have  done, how professionally and  seriously  they\r\n\r\ninvestigate cases and when they finally decide to  charge\r\n\r\nsomebody, they have good reasons for it. That is the  way\r\n\r\nour system has to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have asked us, \"How do you keep your\r\n\r\nsystem clean?\"  Our people have explained to them, \"Well,\r\n\r\nwe  have  a CPIB.\"  Then the question is, \"Whom does  the\r\n\r\nCPIB  report to?\"  And the explanation is that it reports\r\n\r\nto  the  Prime Minister.  Then, the question comes  back,\r\n\r\n\"No, you do not understand me.  Whom does the CPIB report\r\n\r\nto?\"   In  other  words, reporting to the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean that the CPIB will work.  But we  have  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure that we have a system where the people in  key\r\n\r\nplaces,  i.e.  the Prime Minister and his Ministers,  can\r\n\r\nmake  it work.  And if there is somebody who is not clean\r\n\r\n- even a Minister - he would be investigated and, if need\r\n\r\nbe,  action  will be taken.  As Members  know,  this  has\r\n\r\nunfortunately sometimes been necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan Nair, you can take\r\n\r\nboth  cuts  at one go.

In  a\r\n\r\nsense, the Hon. Prime Minister is the only or main person\r\n\r\nin  Singapore who decides on this - of course, I am sure,\r\n\r\nwith  the  Cabinet.  Should this be reviewed  and  should\r\n\r\nParliament  decide, together with the Prime Minister,  on\r\n\r\nthis   issue?    Should  the  citizens  decide,   through\r\n\r\nParliament and the President of Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it fairer and in order to be more certain,\r\n\r\nshould it not fix, say, on a particular month, every five\r\n\r\nyears,  and  not leave it to the discretion of  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nPrime Minister?  Is this not fairer and more just to  the\r\n\r\nnation  as  a  whole and not leave it  to  any  political\r\n\r\nparty?   Only  if  there is an emergency  situation,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, some natural disaster in the country, a serious\r\n\r\ncivil strife or disquiet, which the Prime Minister has to\r\n\r\njustify  to an independent body to be created,  can  that\r\n\r\ndate then be vacated so that there is finality as regards\r\n\r\nthe date for election.\r\n\r\n<br>11.45 am\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the ideal, Sir? What is the experience in\r\n\r\nother  countries - USA, UK, Australia, Canada, France  or\r\n\r\nGermany?   Should  we also modify the system  of  general\r\n\r\nelections,  lessening the need to have political  parties\r\n\r\nas  the  years  go by, so that we do not  go  by  way  of\r\n\r\npolitical parties but by way of good citizens serving the\r\n\r\nnation in the political arena?  There is a great deal  of\r\n\r\nenergy and time spent under the current system, and a lot\r\n\r\nof  uncertainty  and  even  animosity  amongst  political\r\n\r\nparties  and politicians.  Is this ideal?  Is there  room\r\n\r\nfor  improvement?  Most nations may not even think  about\r\n\r\nthese things, but let us try, if it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible,  having regard to our circumstances  and  local\r\n\r\nconditions.   These problems that we have,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nquarrels, animosity or wastage of time, may not  be  good\r\n\r\nas  our  citizens would then not respect our politicians,\r\n\r\nwhich  they  well deserve.  It is important to  give  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  a good system so that our politicians are  well\r\n\r\nrespected by our citizenry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have around 50 candidates in 50\r\n\r\nconstituencies on a single seat basis to run individually\r\n\r\nand,  perhaps,  we  do not need GRCs.  And,  perhaps,  we\r\n\r\ncould have another 50, appointed by an elections board of\r\n\r\nsenior  wise  and intelligent people, who have  been  ex-politicians, civil servants, and representatives from the\r\n\r\njudiciary,  business  groups and  all  religious  groups,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  in  a sense similar to the House of  Lords  and\r\n\r\neven, in a small sense, like NMPs.  This will get rid  of\r\n\r\nconstant complaints that we cannot get good people to run\r\n\r\nfor  elections  because many wise and intelligent  people\r\n\r\nand  good  people may not want to get into the  arena  of\r\n\r\nalmost a litigation form of politics, but are willing  to\r\n\r\nserve in a quiet way when they are appointed.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany people who are capable of doing that but may be very\r\n\r\nreluctant to run for elections.   As far as the Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment is concerned, I would like to say that we must\r\n\r\nensure  that  it  is as independent as  possible  and  is\r\n\r\nperceived to be, and the citizenry must respect that  and\r\n\r\nbelieve that it is independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of whether they are involved in the\r\n\r\nissue of electoral boundaries, this is an issue that  has\r\n\r\nbeen debated before in Parliament.  Perhaps it should  be\r\n\r\nrevisited  to  make it a fairer playing  ground  for  all\r\n\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are running out of time, Mr\r\n\r\nChandra.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> At the end of the day,\r\n\r\nSir,   Parliament  is  there  to  serve  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  no  matter  what party  or  affiliation  they\r\n\r\nbelong  to.

It includes things like development of  public\r\n\r\ninformation strategies to keep voters educated about  the\r\n\r\nvoting  process  and making improvements  to  the  voting\r\n\r\nprocess.  I would like to know what improvements would be\r\n\r\nmade to the voting process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the development of public information\r\n\r\nstrategies, I would like to know the objectives and, more\r\n\r\nspecifically, the contents which the Elections Department\r\n\r\nhas  in  mind  for the development of public  information\r\n\r\nstrategies.    Would   the   Elections   Department    be\r\n\r\nconsidering  public information strategies  to  demystify\r\n\r\nthe  myth  of the serial number behind the ballot  paper?\r\n\r\nWould   the  Elections  Department  strive  towards   the\r\n\r\ndebunking of the perceived notion that the PAP Government\r\n\r\nmight  trace the votes?  There must be a sincere show  of\r\n\r\neffort  in  this  area.   If the aims  of  the  Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment  were  indeed to seek genuine improvements  to\r\n\r\nthe voting process, the Workers' Party would be more than\r\n\r\nhappy  to assist the Elections Department in its  efforts\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question often asked by electoral reform\r\n\r\nadvocates  is:   why  the  necessity  for  the  Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment  to be placed under the purview of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office?  The Workers' Party is  of  the  view\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  necessary  to de-politicise  the  Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment.   It  should be taken over by an  independent\r\n\r\nelections   intermediary  in  the  form   of   maybe   an\r\n\r\nindependent elections commission. This would enhance  the\r\n\r\ncredibility of the elections intermediary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I would like to question the expanded functions of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElections  Department  and  its  intention  to  implement\r\n\r\nelectronic voting in Singapore.  With electronic  voting,\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  vote  count  is  designed  by  computer\r\n\r\nprogrammers commissioned by the PAP Government. Where are\r\n\r\nthe  safeguards?  There is no independent body to monitor\r\n\r\nvote  rigging  and audit the results in the  event  of  a\r\n\r\ndispute.  What is at stake is a move from voting  with  a\r\n\r\npaper audit trail to voting without an audit trail.   The\r\n\r\nvoters  must  trust the technology and  the  organisation\r\n\r\nbehind  it  to  ensure that their voting  intentions  are\r\n\r\ncorrectly  recorded.  There is no feedback,  confirmation\r\n\r\nor  guarantee  that the voters' intentions  are  properly\r\n\r\ntranslated into digital impulse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current technologies do not allow voters to verify\r\n\r\nthat their votes have been properly recorded and counted.\r\n\r\nIn   the  last  US  Presidential  Elections  in  Florida,\r\n\r\nthousands  of  electronically recorded votes  disappeared\r\n\r\nand  in  the  absence of paper backups, they  were  never\r\n\r\nrecovered.   The effect may have affected the outcome  of\r\n\r\nthe  elections. The loss of computing cannot allow anyone\r\n\r\nto be certain that the complex software needed to support\r\n\r\ne-voting  is  fully  secure  and  error-free.  Electronic\r\n\r\nvoting systems are inherently open to fraud.  A fraudster\r\n\r\ncould easily bury two lines of code among the millions of\r\n\r\ncodes and it would affect the way votes are recorded.  My\r\n\r\nquestion, Sir, is whether it is necessary to spend  $21.5\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the  electronic voting  system  when  paper\r\n\r\nvoting is still the safest and most efficient method  for\r\n\r\ncarrying out an election.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, Mr Conrad Raj's\r\n\r\narticle on \"Time to relook at MPs, Mayors\" in the  recent\r\n\r\npublication in Streats generated some public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his article, Mr Raj wondered whether it is time\r\n\r\nto  reduce  the number of MPs in Parliament  and  thereby\r\n\r\nsave   on   the   expense.   The  question   is   whether\r\n\r\nParliamentarians are in excess.  With due respect, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  not think so.  The starting point of all democracy is\r\n\r\nthat  people must effectively have a say in the decision-making  process and be able to participate in it.   Given\r\n\r\nthe practical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulties of getting everybody in the same  place  and\r\n\r\nhaving  a  say  at the same time, they then choose  their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.   In  this  arrangement,  the   ultimate\r\n\r\nnumber  of representatives is really a function  of  what\r\n\r\ncan   physically   and   practically   be   accommodated.\r\n\r\nDemocracy  therefore must proximate towards an  ideal  of\r\n\r\nmore representation rather than fewer representation.  If\r\n\r\nyou ask me, there can never be enough representatives  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the record, it should be noted that in 1959,\r\n\r\nagainst  a population of 1.5 million, we had 51 MPs.   In\r\n\r\n2001, against a population of 4.1 million people, we only\r\n\r\nhad  84  MPs.  You will see therefore that  although  the\r\n\r\npopulation  has  increased by more than  2.5  times,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of MPs did not increase by the same margin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the real beef in Mr Raj's argument is that\r\n\r\nwe  should be saving money on MPs' allowances. This is  a\r\n\r\nsilly  suggestion.  Why  not have  fewer  newspapers  and\r\n\r\njournalists?   Perhaps  there are too  many  journalists,\r\n\r\nwhich  explains why they are looking hard for  issues  to\r\n\r\njustify  their job and their salary.  If the numbers  are\r\n\r\nreduced,   newspapers   can   save   money   for    their\r\n\r\nshareholders.  I will say it once again.  The  office  of\r\n\r\nthe  MP  is  not an office of profit or gain.   The  MP's\r\n\r\nundertaking is a response to a call to public service. We\r\n\r\nall make personal sacrifices in the spirit of wanting  to\r\n\r\nserve  the  people  and it would be unrealistic  or  even\r\n\r\nnaive  to expect any of my colleagues here to make  total\r\n\r\nsacrifices.   We want good people in Parliament  and  for\r\n\r\ngood  people  to serve.  Why should we cut back  just  to\r\n\r\nsave  a  few  million dollars on MPs' allowances  if  the\r\n\r\nconsequence  is  a  weaker  Government?   Think  of   the\r\n\r\nbillions that would be lost if the Government was weak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind Mr Raj that MPs are already\r\n\r\nmaking  the  sacrifice when the Government  decided  last\r\n\r\nyear  that  the  allowance would be  taxed,  and  not  to\r\n\r\nmention  the reduction to the allowances.  To the  credit\r\n\r\nof  my colleagues here, no one protested because we  felt\r\n\r\nthat  it was the right thing to do.

All these questions are  not  really\r\n\r\nnew, including the question of discretion to call for  an\r\n\r\nelection by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not come across a parliamentary democracy\r\n\r\nthat  is on the British system where the date of election\r\n\r\nis  fixed.   Under  this system of British  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, the term is fixed for four or five  years,  as\r\n\r\nthe  case may be, but the discretion to call for election\r\n\r\nrests  with  the  Prime  Minister.   The  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nconsiders a number of factors before he decides.  But  if\r\n\r\nany serious political parties or individuals are planning\r\n\r\nto  run  for  an election, they should not wait  for  the\r\n\r\ntiming  of  the  announcement of  the  Writ  before  they\r\n\r\nprepare for it.  They should prepare right now.  In fact,\r\n\r\nthat  should  be the case.  I believe that  some  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  parties are already doing so.  That  is  what\r\n\r\nthe PAP Government always does.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of making changes to our political system\r\n\r\nby cherry-picking from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  systems  seems to be good, nice to  have.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink this idea, while good, cannot really be implemented\r\n\r\nbecause  there is no perfect system in the world that  is\r\n\r\napplicable to all situations.  We must have a system that\r\n\r\nwould  meet  our social and political contexts,  and  our\r\n\r\nsystem  has  worked well for us and we would change  only\r\n\r\nwhen we see the need to change.  I have not come across a\r\n\r\nsystem  where  a  group of wise men  appoint  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.   It  is always the people  who  would  elect\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament. They are not appointed by a  group\r\n\r\nof wise men.  In any case, where do we find this group of\r\n\r\nwise  men?  Who are we to choose this group of wise  men,\r\n\r\nwho  would then decide that certain people deserve to  be\r\n\r\nin Parliament and others are not to be?  If there is such\r\n\r\na country doing this, please let me know and I would like\r\n\r\nto go and study it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether it is a good idea to have\r\n\r\nthe  Elections Department under the Prime Minister, where\r\n\r\nelse  should  it be?  If it is going to be  an  elections\r\n\r\ncommission, can we guarantee that if we have an elections\r\n\r\ncommission, there would be no fraud, no vote rigging  and\r\n\r\nthat  the  system  is free and fair?   We  have  seen  in\r\n\r\ncountries where there are Elections Commissions  and  yet\r\n\r\nwe know there are problems in the voting process in these\r\n\r\ncountries.  Throughout all the general elections that  we\r\n\r\nhave  held, nobody has ever complained that our Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment  was not fair and transparent.  If  there  was\r\n\r\nany, they could always file a complaint with the Election\r\n\r\nJudge,  and  the Judge would decide whether indeed  there\r\n\r\nwas such a case or not.\r\n\r\n12.00 noon\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of number of MPs in Parliament, I\r\n\r\nthink  Mr  Sin Boon Ann has adequately provided  his  own\r\n\r\nanswer.   But to put the subject in context, Members  may\r\n\r\nknow  that in 1959 when we had our first General Election\r\n\r\nthere were 51 Members of Parliament.  At that time, there\r\n\r\nwere  586,000 voters - which means an MP looked after  an\r\n\r\naverage of 11,500\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvoters.   In 1980, the number of voters looked  after  by\r\n\r\neach  MP was 17,200, and there were 75 MPs.  In the  last\r\n\r\nGeneral  Election  in 2001, the number of  voters  looked\r\n\r\nafter by an MP was 24,200.  So we are not having too many\r\n\r\nMPs  today.   In fact, our MPs work harder,  having  many\r\n\r\nresidents to look after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also asked whether we can have a\r\n\r\nnon-adversarial system of government or not.  If there is\r\n\r\na modern government like that, I would also like to study\r\n\r\nit  -  where you can have a group of people and political\r\n\r\nparties  getting  together and there  is  no  adversarial\r\n\r\npolitics.   Politics, by its own nature, is  adversarial.\r\n\r\nThe  only model I can find is really in the villages  and\r\n\r\namong  the tribes, where tribal chiefs who are  there  by\r\n\r\ninheritance   decide  what  is  good  for   the   tribes.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  for the villages.  They have a village  head,\r\n\r\nvillage  elders, and they will be the ones to decide  how\r\n\r\nto  run the village.  But in a modern government, in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  state  that  we have, in all  countries  in  the\r\n\r\nworld, I have not come across any system where there is a\r\n\r\ngroup of wise men deciding for the rest of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Elections Department's\r\n\r\nbudget,  yes, indeed the budget has gone up by about  $18\r\n\r\nmillion.   Most of the money is, in fact, set  aside  for\r\n\r\nthe  new systems we were planning to have - e-voting,  e-registers - but these are only to be spent when there  is\r\n\r\na  general election.  As far as the training of  election\r\n\r\nofficials  is concerned, we are going to spend  about  $5\r\n\r\nmillion for the 15,000 election officials.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst time we are doing this type of training because  we\r\n\r\nare going to train public officials on a continuing basis\r\n\r\nso  that we do not have to give them last minute training\r\n\r\nand that there will be difficulties for the officials  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  their  duties.   So  we  are  going  to  have\r\n\r\ncontinuing training and e-learning for civil servants, so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  be  prepared and can  help  to  conduct\r\n\r\nelections when a general election is called.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the $18 million that is being put aside\r\n\r\ntoday  will  not  be  spent unless  there  is  a  General\r\n\r\nElection to be held.  The extra $18 million is just  only\r\n\r\nfor contingency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia asked about electronic voting and\r\n\r\nwhether it is secure or not.  If he were here in the last\r\n\r\nParliament, he would know that we have gone through  this\r\n\r\nin  great  detail.  No electronic voting  system  can  be\r\n\r\nintroduced until it passes an audit test.  The test would\r\n\r\nthen  determine  whether the system  is  good  enough  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  there is no fraud and that we can  have  an\r\n\r\naudit  trail  to the voting intention of the individuals.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why we have spent quite a bit of money studying\r\n\r\nthe previous system.  We are also studying other systems,\r\n\r\nfor  example, the one used by the Indians in some states.\r\n\r\nThat  is  a  more simple system.  We need  to  have  some\r\n\r\nadditional  features to ensure that  there  is  an  audit\r\n\r\ntrail  to  the voters to trace the voters' intention,  if\r\n\r\nthere is a need to check.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether we can demystify ballot papers' serial\r\n\r\nnumbers,  we have explained this many times  before.   If\r\n\r\nthere  is a fraud, and ballot boxes are stuffed,  and  if\r\n\r\nthe  ballot papers have no serial numbers, how do we know\r\n\r\nthat  there was indeed a genuine voter and not a  phantom\r\n\r\nvoter?   The  serial  number provides  the  source.   The\r\n\r\nserial number cannot be traced to the individual until  a\r\n\r\npetition is raised in court and the ballot box was opened\r\n\r\nafter  it  had  been  sealed at the end  of  the  general\r\n\r\nelection.   So,  it is quite clear that  there  are  good\r\n\r\nintentions  for having the serial number.  In fact,  even\r\n\r\nthe  British  today have serial numbers in  their  voting\r\n\r\npapers, and ours is the system handed over to us  by  the\r\n\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For public education purposes, we will be educating\r\n\r\nthe  public how to go about casting their votes,  whether\r\n\r\nit is electronic votes or whether it is a paper vote.  We\r\n\r\ndo  that  all the time.  When the time comes, nearer  the\r\n\r\nelection, we will intensify the public education efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. \"Guillotine\" time.

With respect,\r\n\r\nSir,  should there be a need for a Prime Minister in  any\r\n\r\ncountry?  Why must there be a Head of the Cabinet all the\r\n\r\ntime?   Why can we not have a group of persons  and  they\r\n\r\ncan  take charge on a rotational basis, say, change every\r\n\r\ntwo  to  three years?  This will give all of  the  senior\r\n\r\nCabinet Ministers higher responsibility and they can also\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  they  want to hold  or  aspire  for  the\r\n\r\nhighest office in the Cabinet.  Should the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  other Ministers serve not more than one term of  4-5\r\n\r\nyears,  or two terms of 8-10 years?  In a sense, Sir,  no\r\n\r\none should be indispensable and no one should be burdened\r\n\r\nwith  such serious responsibilities for too long.  Others\r\n\r\nmust share in the pressure, and perhaps pleasure, of high\r\n\r\noffice.   And  all must be given a chance to  excel,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  meritocracy,  Sir.  In other  countries,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters do change often after general elections.   That\r\n\r\nhas  got  its merits or demerits.  It may be  healthy  to\r\n\r\nhave  changes.  I would therefore urge that  a  study  be\r\n\r\ndone  by the Cabinet on this and report to Parliament  to\r\n\r\nsee what is best for Singapore in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Cabinet meetings, Sir, Article 36 of the\r\n\r\nConstitution  provides for a Cabinet  Secretary  for  the\r\n\r\narranging  of the business and for keeping of minutes  of\r\n\r\nCabinet meetings.  How do we educate Parliamentarians and\r\n\r\nour  citizens on Cabinet meetings and Cabinet matters  if\r\n\r\nit  is  done in such secrecy in many senses of the  word?\r\n\r\nIt  is  important that although these may be  classified,\r\n\r\nmay  be  secret,  perhaps there should  be  a  review  of\r\n\r\nCabinet  proceedings so that Parliamentarians would  also\r\n\r\nbe  educated about what is going on in Cabinet.  Although\r\n\r\nit is not in the Constitution, there may be some rules as\r\n\r\nregards  secrecy and for how many years  papers  must  be\r\n\r\nkept secret.  I understand, like in England, if I am  not\r\n\r\nmistaken, it is about 30 years or so, and in Singapore it\r\n\r\nmay  be  likewise.   Should  this  be  reviewed  so  that\r\n\r\nhistorians  and people who are interested in knowing  the\r\n\r\ndeliberations  of Cabinet and decisions made  could  have\r\n\r\naccess  to  some  of the information and these  could  be\r\n\r\ndeclassified at an earlier period than what  we  have  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment?   It  will give a better  insight  into  the\r\n\r\nworkings\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, you better finish\r\n\r\nyour speech, otherwise you would not get any replies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> That is all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am at a loss\r\n\r\nfor  words  -  perhaps we should rotate the  replies.   I\r\n\r\nthink it would be quite a unique system to have a Cabinet\r\n\r\nwithout the Prime Minister.  There are very few countries\r\n\r\nwhich  operate like this.  Switzerland is  the  only  one\r\n\r\nwhich  I  know of where they have a Council of  Ministers\r\n\r\nand  the  Chairman rotates, and he purely presides.   But\r\n\r\nSingapore is not like Switzerland.  Southeast Asia is not\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of  Europe, and even then no other  European\r\n\r\ncountries operate like this.  So I do not think we intend\r\n\r\nto  start  a  study on a rotation system  for  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinistership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Cabinet meetings and Cabinet matters, I am\r\n\r\nnot  sure  what we need to educate people  about.   There\r\n\r\nexists a Cabinet, Cabinet meets, Cabinet discusses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCabinet   matters  and  Cabinet  makes  decisions   which\r\n\r\nresulted  in national policies.  I think everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat,  and  that  is sufficient.  I do not  know  if  the\r\n\r\nMember is proposing to televise Cabinet proceedings.   It\r\n\r\nwould  be quite a ground-breaking proposition.  But there\r\n\r\nis  a reason why Cabinet proceedings are kept secret  and\r\n\r\nthe  oath  of  office  is that every Minister  shall  not\r\n\r\nreveal  any  of the Cabinet discussions or votes  of  the\r\n\r\nmembers  unless they are properly required by law  or  by\r\n\r\nhis duties.  Because we have collective responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are in the Cabinet, you discuss, you\r\n\r\ndeliberate, you disagree, you debate, but eventually  you\r\n\r\ndecide   and  take  collective  responsibility  for   the\r\n\r\ndecision.   If  you  do  not  agree  with  the   decision\r\n\r\nfundamentally, you resign and can say what you want.  But\r\n\r\nas  long as you are a member of the team, you have to  be\r\n\r\npart  of the team and you have to be a team-player.  This\r\n\r\nis  why  Cabinet proceedings are secret, apart  from  the\r\n\r\ninherent  sensitivity  of many of the  discussions  which\r\n\r\nhave to take place in Cabinet, the subjects of which  are\r\n\r\nsensitive  and will remain sensitive for a long  time  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan talks about the British system,\r\n\r\nwhere  records are released after 30 years.  But not  all\r\n\r\nBritish  records are released.  If you go back  and  look\r\n\r\nfor  records 30 years ago, all the sensitive  parts  have\r\n\r\nbeen excised. Somebody has gone through and decided which\r\n\r\nparts  remain  sealed and which parts are  published  and\r\n\r\nopen  to  researchers or historians.  I think our  system\r\n\r\nworks well.  If there is a serious historian who needs to\r\n\r\ndo  a  study  of  some subjects and needs access  to  the\r\n\r\nrecords, his request can be considered.  But to  open  up\r\n\r\nour  system  because that is the fashion in the  West,  I\r\n\r\nthink  30  years  is not long - 100 years  may  be.   Our\r\n\r\ngrandchildren can think about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, are you withdrawing\r\n\r\nthe amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Thank you, Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.

It  talks about the tenure of office  of  the\r\n\r\nPresident   and  other  council  members.   As  discussed\r\n\r\nearlier,  Sir, there is a period of six years of  tenure,\r\n\r\nplus four years each as the years go by.  I would like to\r\n\r\nask  if this should be reviewed and more persons be given\r\n\r\nthe  chance to be in the Council of Presidential Advisers\r\n\r\nas I had discussed in the earlier parts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the issue of the Report of the Council of\r\n\r\nPresidential Advisers is presented to the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand  to  Parliament under Article 37K.  It is  important,\r\n\r\nSir,  for the citizenry to know about this.  Although  it\r\n\r\nmay  be  presented  to Parliament,  is  there  an  avenue\r\n\r\nwhereby  some  of these matters can be presented  to  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  so  that they know that there is  in  existence\r\n\r\nsuch  a body?  Very often, our citizens may not be  fully\r\n\r\naware  of  what is going on in Parliament.  So,  in  some\r\n\r\nways, all these could be disseminated to our citizenry so\r\n\r\nthat  they have an idea of what is going on and that they\r\n\r\nare made aware of the workings of the office of President\r\n\r\nand  the Advisers to the President.  It is important that\r\n\r\nwe  have  a  good  mix of officials  in  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nPresidential  Advisers,  including  different  races  and\r\n\r\nreligious persons, so that it will be a balanced  set  of\r\n\r\nadvisers  who are advising the President.   This  can  be\r\n\r\ndisseminated to the public so that we are accountable  to\r\n\r\nthe  public and they would be made more aware of what  is\r\n\r\ngoing on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  workings  of  very senior positions  and  senior\r\n\r\norgans of the state.\r\n\r\n<br>12.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, the Council of\r\n\r\nPresidential Advisers comprises six people;  two  decided\r\n\r\nat  the President's discretion; two decided on the advice\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime Minister; one on the advice of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice;  and  one on the advice of the Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked whether we could have more\r\n\r\nrotation.

I am pleased to hear  from  the\r\n\r\nDeputy   Prime  Minister  that  budgetary  and  financial\r\n\r\nprudence is the main objective of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to maintain that the current budget\r\n\r\ndeficit  is still very small, estimated to be  only  $0.9\r\n\r\nbillion,  or  3%  of the FY 2003 total operating  revenue\r\n\r\ncollection  of S$29.6 billion or, in fact, a very  minute\r\n\r\n0.6%  of the Year 2002 annual GDP of $156 billion.   Sir,\r\n\r\nhow  is  this small amount of deficit going to  stimulate\r\n\r\nour flagging economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance may respond that, if need\r\n\r\nbe, there will be off-Budget measures to be announced  to\r\n\r\nhelp  in case the economy worsens.  Whilst I concede that\r\n\r\noff-Budget  measures are helpful and a responsive  manner\r\n\r\nto  deal  with a fast deteriorating economy, they  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  used  too  often to become a norm.   The  annual\r\n\r\nbudget   should  be  the  main  forum  to  announce   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  financial  and fiscal  plans  for  the  new\r\n\r\nfinancial  year.  And then businesses and the people  can\r\n\r\nplan  accordingly.   I would like to  suggest  that  off-Budget  measures should be used sparingly, and only  when\r\n\r\nin dire need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a point I wish to take up with the Minister is\r\n\r\nthe   accuracy  and  reliability  of  the  yearly  budget\r\n\r\nforecast.   I  contend  that  it  is  important  to  have\r\n\r\naccurate  budget forecasts.  It is the basis  upon  which\r\n\r\nthe Government sets its financial plans for the year.  FY\r\n\r\n2002  is  a  case  in point.  The original  forecast  was\r\n\r\nestimated  to  be  a deficit of $900 million.   Now,  the\r\n\r\nrevised  latest  estimate is only a  small  $100  million\r\n\r\ndeficit will be incurred, inclusive of transfers of  $600\r\n\r\nmillion.   In fact, if we were to put back the transfers,\r\n\r\nan  actual surplus of $500 million will be recorded.   My\r\n\r\npoint  is  that  the  effectiveness of  the  Government's\r\n\r\nyearly  plans  depends heavily on the accuracy  of  these\r\n\r\nfigures.  If the Government forecast a large deficit  but\r\n\r\nended  the year actually with a small deficit or  even  a\r\n\r\nsurplus,  then the Government would have lost  an  entire\r\n\r\nyear to achieve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe intended result of the fiscal and financial plans for\r\n\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another matter relating to Government financial\r\n\r\npolicy,  I  would  like to ask the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nwhether  the Government has a policy to pay its suppliers\r\n\r\nand  contractors promptly.  Similarly, is there a  policy\r\n\r\nfor  Government  agencies, like IRAS,  CPF,  Customs  and\r\n\r\nExcise  Department and other fee collecting agencies,  to\r\n\r\npromptly  repay  deposits, refunds  of  overpayments  and\r\n\r\nvarious  sums  due  to the public?  I ask  this  question\r\n\r\nbecause  during  this difficult financial  period,  where\r\n\r\nbusiness  is  generally poor, most small-time  suppliers,\r\n\r\ncontractors and businessmen are very tight on cash  flow.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  Government agencies are  slow  in  making\r\n\r\npayments,  then the tight cash flow problems may  trigger\r\n\r\nthe  collapse of these small companies unnecessarily.   I\r\n\r\ndo not believe that civil servants will deliberately hold\r\n\r\nback payments.  I do believe that civil servants are  not\r\n\r\nso vicious or vindictive.  They are supposed to be \"civil\r\n\r\nservants\".   But  slow payments could result  because  of\r\n\r\nlack  of  sense of urgency, misguided priority  of  work,\r\n\r\nover-prudency in checking and re-checking, mistrust,  and\r\n\r\nmany other reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Ministry of Finance send\r\n\r\nout a directive or reminder to all Government agencies to\r\n\r\nbe  diligent  and  prompt in payments  to  suppliers  and\r\n\r\ncontractors.  In fact, the same directive can  be  issued\r\n\r\nto Temasek Holdings and other Government-linked companies\r\n\r\nto  be  extra mindful of the need for prompt payments  to\r\n\r\ntheir  contractors  and suppliers during  this  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could you go to your next cut, Mr\r\n\r\nLeong?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I have one last paragraph before\r\n\r\nI go on to my next cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Finish it, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> The DPM may ask me to give him\r\n\r\nactual  instances of slow payments and he will look  into\r\n\r\nthem.

Sir, the points I wish to\r\n\r\nmake  on  this cut have been covered in my speech  during\r\n\r\nthe  Budget debate.  But since the Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  not  replied  to  my queries, I  shall  repeat  them\r\n\r\nbriefly here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main question is that now that the ERC has\r\n\r\ncompleted  its Report, what is next?  Will  the  existing\r\n\r\nCommittee  remain?   How  about  annual  reviews  of  the\r\n\r\ndirections and recommendations made?  We live in  a  fast\r\n\r\nchanging  and  dynamic world.  Who will be  steering  the\r\n\r\nfuture directions, or look ahead on whether there is  any\r\n\r\nneed  to  shift  course due to the changing  environment?\r\n\r\nCircumstances  change rapidly.  Some policies  laid  down\r\n\r\nnow  in  the ERC Report may become irrelevant or,  worse,\r\n\r\ncounter-productive.   Somebody  must  watch  over   these\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, many recommendations in the Report involve\r\n\r\nnumerous Ministries, and cut across Ministerial lines.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  doubt the ability of the Ministry of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  which  can  monitor the implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nnumerous  recommendations  made,  but  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that a higher authority be appointed to supervise\r\n\r\nand   oversee   the   implementation   of   the   various\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  what I would call  a  supra-Ministerial\r\n\r\nperson or group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I go on to my next cut, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please go on to your next two cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> My next cut is on direct and\r\n\r\nindirect  taxes.  The Government's intention is to  shift\r\n\r\nmore  direct  taxes to indirect taxes.  Hence,  corporate\r\n\r\nand income taxes will go down from 22% to 20% by Year  of\r\n\r\nAssessment 2005.  If held true, this would mean that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has to announce a 2% corporate and income  tax\r\n\r\ncut  next  year  in 2004, so that the  20%  rate  can  be\r\n\r\napplied  in Year of Assessment 2005.  Can this target  be\r\n\r\nachieved?  What is the expected impact on the  Government\r\n\r\nbudget with a huge 2% direct tax cut?  Will a huge budget\r\n\r\ndeficit   be  incurred?   Indeed,  is  it  necessary   or\r\n\r\ndesirable to bring the direct tax so quickly down to 20%?\r\n\r\nWould  the Government phase in the 2% cut over  a  longer\r\n\r\nperiod?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always compared with Hong Kong where the\r\n\r\ndirect  tax is a low of 16%, and they have now said  that\r\n\r\nthey would increase it to 17% this year.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\ngap   between  Hong  Kong  and  Singapore  will  be  much\r\n\r\nnarrower.  Is  there a need for Singapore  to  bring  our\r\n\r\ndirect tax lower to compete with Hong Kong?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so as to allow the people and businesses to\r\n\r\nplan ahead, I would like to ask the Minister what is  the\r\n\r\nintended  long-term target rate for direct  and  indirect\r\n\r\ntaxes.   If  we wish to go lower than 20%, does  it  mean\r\n\r\nthat indirect tax, such as GST, will have to go up?  Will\r\n\r\nthe trend continue as Government's expenses escalate?  In\r\n\r\nmany other countries, such as China, USA, France and  UK,\r\n\r\ntheir  GST or VAT are much higher than 10% in most cases.\r\n\r\nI  would  urge  the  Government to  moderate  future  GST\r\n\r\nincreases, as indirect taxes put a heavier burden on  the\r\n\r\nlower income group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the next cut on corporate taxes, I wish\r\n\r\nto  talk  about Group Offsetting of Corporate  Tax.   The\r\n\r\noffsetting of losses within a business group  is  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  of the ERC  Report.   What  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's response?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group relief is currently allowed for subsidiaries\r\n\r\nwhich  are 75% owned Singapore companies of local  parent\r\n\r\ncompanies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere.  And tax offset for losses incurred is only allowed\r\n\r\nfor  current year's losses of the subsidiaries.  Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance inform this House of the experience\r\n\r\nand  usefulness  of this new ruling to date?   What  have\r\n\r\nbeen the claims made so far on group relief based on  the\r\n\r\nexisting regulations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the usage is low, it could well be an indication\r\n\r\nthat  the rules, such as the high 75% ownership, are  too\r\n\r\ntight  to  be  effective  and useful  to  local  business\r\n\r\nconglomerates.  Hence, is there any intention to open  up\r\n\r\nand  liberalise the rules further, such as  lowering  the\r\n\r\neligibility  ownership percentage to 51% and  to  include\r\n\r\noverseas   subsidiaries?   The   inclusion   of   foreign\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries of Singapore companies is in line  with  the\r\n\r\ncall for them to venture abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the DPM and Finance Minister kindly enlighten\r\n\r\nthe House on the points I have raised?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, you can take your\r\n\r\ntwo items together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, having regard to what\r\n\r\nwe  have  heard in the debates of the last three days,  I\r\n\r\nwish to withdraw the cuts for these two items.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the points I wanted to raise\r\n\r\nhave  already  been raised.

But for this year, it is premature to look  ahead\r\n\r\nand conclude that we will need a very big stimulus.  As I\r\n\r\nalso  explained  yesterday,  the  first  quarter  January\r\n\r\nnumbers  look quite stable.  So I think we have  to  wait\r\n\r\nand  hold  our  ammunition  until  the  position  becomes\r\n\r\nclearer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our yearly budget forecast is not accurate enough.\r\n\r\nI  lament  that too.  But it depends on so  many  factors\r\n\r\nwhich  are not completely within our control.  It depends\r\n\r\non  the  state  of  the  economy which  affects  our  tax\r\n\r\nrevenues and also our net investment income.  And that is\r\n\r\nnot completely predictable because it depends on how well\r\n\r\nour investments perform.  At the same time, it depends on\r\n\r\nhow well Ministries spend their own budgets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, as I have explained, the variation was\r\n\r\nnot  in  total revenue, which was quite close to what  we\r\n\r\nhad  predicted,  but in the expenditure which  was  lower\r\n\r\nthan  what we had anticipated.  And we will try our  best\r\n\r\nto get the Ministries to predict accurately and to manage\r\n\r\ntheir budgets within what we have provided for.  But,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, we have to remember that we do not  want\r\n\r\nMinistries  to spend money just to use up what  has  been\r\n\r\nallocated.   And if there are savings, then  they  should\r\n\r\ndeclare them and we can spend the money on something more\r\n\r\nworthwhile  in  future.   So  we  have  to  accept   some\r\n\r\nuncertainties.  I think what we are doing in Singapore is\r\n\r\nnot out of line compared to other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For slow payments, the Member asked if culprits can\r\n\r\nbe  reported to the Ministry of Finance.  Of course  they\r\n\r\ncan.   Indeed,  many such complaints come  to  me  in  my\r\n\r\npublic  e-mail  box and my officers look into  them.  And\r\n\r\nthose people who prefer to remain anonymous, we will look\r\n\r\ninto  their  complaints  too,  if  there  are  sufficient\r\n\r\ndetails to study the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the ERC, what is next? What is next is that\r\n\r\nwe  have to implement the proposals.  The main ones  have\r\n\r\nalready  been done in the Budget.  The others  will  take\r\n\r\nlonger.   The  Ministries will follow up  and  implement.\r\n\r\nAnd   MTI   will   coordinate   the   follow-up   actions\r\n\r\nsystematically.  Their status will be regularly  reported\r\n\r\nto  the  Prime  Minister's Office.  If there  are  inter-agency  issues to be resolved and Ministries cannot  sort\r\n\r\nout  themselves,  the Prime Minister or  myself  can  get\r\n\r\ninvolved, and we will sort it out.  But I do not see this\r\n\r\nas a very difficult problem.  We are already going to set\r\n\r\nup  a Ministerial Committee on Services.  And I think  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to deal with quite a lot  of  the  issues\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will make sure that between MTI, the other\r\n\r\neconomic  Ministries,  other  implementing  agencies  and\r\n\r\nstatutory   boards,   the   ERC's   recommendations   are\r\n\r\nsystematically followed up.  The measures will have to be\r\n\r\nupdated  as  the situation changes.  I do not foresee  us\r\n\r\ndoing  an exercise of this magnitude very soon.  We  will\r\n\r\ndo  it  maybe every decade or 15 years.  But, in between,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be other exercises to update,  to  bring  in\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  inputs,  and to  adjust  our  plans  and\r\n\r\nstrategies to new developments and new situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked about direct and indirect\r\n\r\ntaxation, whether we will be able to offset the reduction\r\n\r\nof  20%.  I think it is most important that we do  reduce\r\n\r\nour  taxes to 20%, as promised, if it is at all possible.\r\n\r\nBecause  we  have committed to this, it is the  direction\r\n\r\nwhich  we  need  to  go, and it is  the  basis  on  which\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  calculated  and  decided  to   come   to\r\n\r\nSingapore. We need to deliver on this promise to maintain\r\n\r\nour credibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why it is all the more important to raise\r\n\r\nthe  GST  to  4% this year, 1st January, and to  5%  next\r\n\r\nyear.   Going to 5% will raise revenue of about  0.8%  of\r\n\r\nGDP  per year, which is about half the revenue lost  from\r\n\r\nour  corporate  and personal tax cuts, which  is  not  an\r\n\r\ninsubstantial loss. This should leave the Government with\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmodest  surplus  over the medium term,  provided  we  are\r\n\r\ncareful not to increase expenditures recklessly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for whether it will be enough, we have no plans\r\n\r\nat present to raise GST beyond 5%.  But, if in future, we\r\n\r\nhave  to go below 20% in our corporate and personal taxes\r\n\r\nto maintain Singapore's international competitiveness, or\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has to increase social  expenditure  and\r\n\r\nneeds  more  revenue, then we cannot rule out  increasing\r\n\r\nthe GST rate beyond 5%.  But we have no plans to do so at\r\n\r\nthe present time.  We are still in the process of getting\r\n\r\nto 5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group offsetting of corporate taxes - we introduced\r\n\r\nthis  last  year in Budget 2002, and it will take  effect\r\n\r\nonly  from  this  Year of Assessment (YA 2003).   Because\r\n\r\ncompanies are required to submit their tax returns for YA\r\n\r\n2003  only  in  July  this year, we  cannot  measure  the\r\n\r\neffects of the system yet at this stage.  We will not  be\r\n\r\nliberalising the group relief system at this time because\r\n\r\nit  is a very fundamental overhaul of our tax regime.  So\r\n\r\nit  is prudent for us to start conservatively, especially\r\n\r\nsince the impact on companies' behaviour and Government's\r\n\r\nfinances cannot be measured yet.  Further, the lower  the\r\n\r\nthreshold,  the more prone the system will be  to  abuse.\r\n\r\nMany countries which have introduced group relief started\r\n\r\nwith  a 100% threshold.  Even today, many countries still\r\n\r\nmaintain thresholds which are closer to 100% than the 75%\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  chosen.  So we will keep  it  as  it  is,\r\n\r\nmonitor  the  reactions, and after  a  couple  of  years,\r\n\r\nreview and decide whether changes will be necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Andy Gan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun</b> rose --.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr John Chen, you have lost your\r\n\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, our\r\n\r\npush  to  have  more entrepreneurs must  be  followed  by\r\n\r\nmoderating\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour tax laws to allow successful entrepreneurs, who would\r\n\r\nhave  paid their fair share of income tax and other forms\r\n\r\nof  taxes in their lifetime, to pass their wealth  on  or\r\n\r\nafter  death  without their estate having  to  pay  taxes\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, estate duty does not just affect the rich and\r\n\r\nwealthy.   Over the last decade, assets of  many  average\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  also grown.  Even those  with  modest\r\n\r\nincome  can now expect to have assets exceeding $600,000,\r\n\r\nthe base now which is tax free.  Some taxpayers resort to\r\n\r\nusing  trust vehicles to achieve the maximum tax  savings\r\n\r\npossible during their lifetime, while others use them  to\r\n\r\navoid  estate  duty.   These are expensive  vehicles  for\r\n\r\nmany,   in  general,  to  utilise,  and  some  may   find\r\n\r\nthemselves disadvantaged as well.  Then there are  others\r\n\r\nwho  resort  to  transferring their assets  to  nominated\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries   well  before  they  pass  away,   leaving\r\n\r\nthemselves with some money and no assets to spend for the\r\n\r\nrest   of  their  lives.   This  plan  works  well   when\r\n\r\ncircumstances happened the way it is planned.   But  when\r\n\r\nit  does  not, the originator of the wealth may not  have\r\n\r\nhis  assets  and  money  back from the  beneficiaries  so\r\n\r\neasily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deceased's estate is subject to the probate\r\n\r\nprocess which may be long and costly, especially to those\r\n\r\nwithout   a  will.   The  process  of  ascertaining   the\r\n\r\ndeceased's  assets and the valuation of assets  may  take\r\n\r\ntime,  and  in  some  cases, years.   Each  step  of  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  such  as securing of letters of administration,\r\n\r\nwill  have a cost.  Sometimes, the beneficiaries are left\r\n\r\nwith  very  little or none of the assets at  all  as  the\r\n\r\nestate  duty  could well be more than the  value  of  the\r\n\r\nassets.  This happens when the value of the assets in the\r\n\r\nestate   declines  drastically  in  value,   leaving   an\r\n\r\ninsufficient amount to make tax payable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote an actual case. The father of a\r\n\r\nvolunteer  in my ward passed away on 10th May last  year.\r\n\r\nHe  was not a wealthy man, but a modest businessman.   He\r\n\r\nhad  a  will  to  distribute his assets upon  his  death.\r\n\r\nHowever,  10  months  after, even the  valuation  of  his\r\n\r\nassets has not been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompleted  and a grant of probate has yet to  be  issued.\r\n\r\nThe  total  estate  amounts to about $760,000.   A  quick\r\n\r\ncalculation  shows  that after some tax  deductions,  the\r\n\r\nfamily  will have to pay an estate duty of about  $8,000.\r\n\r\nHowever, during this period of waiting, the beneficiaries\r\n\r\nhave lost $60,000 as the notional value of shares left in\r\n\r\nthe  estate  has  declined.  Furthermore, this  declining\r\n\r\nvalue cannot be used to offset the taxable amount of  the\r\n\r\nestate.   To add further misery, legal cost is  mounting.\r\n\r\nThe  family  is now living on other income while  waiting\r\n\r\nfor  the final distribution of the father's estate.  Most\r\n\r\nfamily businesses also face great difficulty surviving in\r\n\r\nthe  event of the principal owner's death.  Some families\r\n\r\nmay have to borrow against equity to pay the estate duty.\r\n\r\nSome  even resort to selling the business away  if  there\r\n\r\nare no other means of paying the estate duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to make Singapore an attractive place to create\r\n\r\nwealth,  I  would support the case for the  abolition  of\r\n\r\nestate  duty  before  wealth  is  being  transferred   to\r\n\r\ncountries  like Malaysia, India and Australia where  they\r\n\r\nhave already done so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lily Neo is not here. Miss Penny\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, in our\r\n\r\nefforts  to  promote the personal wealth  management  and\r\n\r\ntrust  industry, we could perhaps reconsider  the  Estate\r\n\r\nDuty Act.  As Mr Andy Gan has pointed out, our neighbours\r\n\r\nin  the  region had in recent years, one by one, repealed\r\n\r\ntheir Estate Duty Act.  Given the recent amendments  made\r\n\r\nto  the Act and very generous exemptions on both moveable\r\n\r\nand  immoveable  properties, ie, $600,000  for  cash  and\r\n\r\nequities,  and  $9 million on residential  property,  the\r\n\r\nestate duty collected for year 2002 has been estimated to\r\n\r\nbe  at  approximately $86 million.  It is  a  small  sum,\r\n\r\nconsidering the fact that the Government has to  maintain\r\n\r\na  department to administer this function.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nattract individuals to bring their wealth into Singapore,\r\n\r\nperhaps  it would be a disincentive to have estate  duty.\r\n\r\nThe  current estate duty only exempts $600,000  in  cash,\r\n\r\nwhich  is hardly an encouragement for foreigners to bring\r\n\r\ntheir wealth\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.   This amount is big for  those  who  have\r\n\r\nlittle, but small for those who have a lot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any wealth management industry, the sensitivity\r\n\r\nto leakages on returns in the form of taxation and duties\r\n\r\nwould  be of paramount consideration.  Hence, to build  a\r\n\r\nworld-class  wealth management industry,  we  can  remove\r\n\r\nsuch  impediments to wealth generation.  But  perhaps  an\r\n\r\neven  more compelling reason for the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nrepealing  the  Act  is  the fact that  the  majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would  not  be  liable  for  estate   duty.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Act itself can place an unintended burden on\r\n\r\nthe  deceased's family and estate.  The Estate  Duty  Act\r\n\r\nwill  require  a  grant  of  probate  and/or  letter   of\r\n\r\nadministration before a deceased's estate can be  settled\r\n\r\nor  disbursed.   This would mean the freezing  of  assets\r\n\r\nuntil  the  probate  is  granted.  This  requirement  may\r\n\r\ninadvertently cause unintended financial hardship for the\r\n\r\ndeceased family as they would have little or no access to\r\n\r\nany  of  the  assets or liquidity under the name  of  the\r\n\r\ndeceased until probate is granted.  The average time  for\r\n\r\na  grant  of probate, I suppose, is about a year and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  more  for  complicated cases.   The  loss  of  a\r\n\r\nbreadwinner  through  death  can  place  the  family   in\r\n\r\nfinancial  disarray.   Losing  a  loved  one  is  already\r\n\r\ntraumatic.   The  Estate  Duty  Act  just  compounds  the\r\n\r\ndespondency of the deceased's family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the purpose of estate duty is\r\n\r\nwealth  redistribution.  But given a projected collection\r\n\r\nof  $86 million, a whole administrative office that needs\r\n\r\nto  be maintained and sometimes even hardship on families\r\n\r\nwho  would  need  the liquidity when  the  main  or  sole\r\n\r\nbreadwinner is deceased, could the Minister do a holistic\r\n\r\ncost-benefit analysis to determine the relevance of  this\r\n\r\nAct?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I too would\r\n\r\nlike  to  join  my colleagues in asking the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider whether it is time to do away with estate duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past 10 years, on average, there are\r\n\r\nabout  3,000 cases per year of deceased persons who  have\r\n\r\nhad their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestates  taxed.   And the tax that we  collect  from  the\r\n\r\nestate amounts to as low as $42 million in one year to  a\r\n\r\nhigh  of $83 million in the year 2001.  Compared  to  our\r\n\r\ntotal  tax revenue of over $20 billion, this amount  that\r\n\r\nwe collect is actually a very, very small percentage.   I\r\n\r\nam  just wondering if we could not then do away with this\r\n\r\ntax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Andy Gan has related, I think when someone\r\n\r\ndies,  it is a very traumatic experience for the next-of-kin or the family to find that the whole estate is frozen\r\n\r\nuntil   the   court  grants  a  probate  or   letter   of\r\n\r\nadministration.   Then, there is the tedious  process  of\r\n\r\narriving at the amount of duty which is payable.  Even at\r\n\r\nthe point of death, the Commissioner of Estate Duty would\r\n\r\nnot  know how to put a value to the assets of the person.\r\n\r\nSometimes, this process takes years and, in the meantime,\r\n\r\ninterest is chargeable on the amount assessable from  the\r\n\r\ntime of death of the person.  If the process takes years,\r\n\r\nthe  amount of interest that you pay is certainly a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  amount.   And you cannot even pay the  amount  you\r\n\r\nwant in advance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will look at this matter.\r\n\r\nEstate duty was implemented long ago when there were huge\r\n\r\ninequalities in income distribution.  Then, it was a time\r\n\r\nwhen  opportunities were not equal for everybody and  the\r\n\r\nState stepped in in order to redistribute wealth upon the\r\n\r\ndeath   of  a  person.   But,  today,  there  are   equal\r\n\r\nopportunities,  and everybody who works hard  enough  has\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to amass wealth.  Therefore, I think  it\r\n\r\nis time for us to do away with this archaic law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lily Neo, I am allowing you to\r\n\r\nspeak only because you are on the same sub-item.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you, Sir. The Inland Revenue\r\n\r\nAuthority  of  Singapore  (IRAS)  collected  about  $83.5\r\n\r\nmillion  in estate duty last year and this accounted  for\r\n\r\nless\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  0.5%  of all taxes collected.  Estate duty  usually\r\n\r\nadds  to  the pain suffered by mourning families.   While\r\n\r\ngrieving  from  the loss of their loved ones,  they  also\r\n\r\nhave to cope with the hardship created by the seizing  of\r\n\r\nassets until the members have raised the cash to pay  for\r\n\r\nthe estate duty, including interest on late payment also.\r\n\r\nEstate  duty penalises the frugal who have passed  wealth\r\n\r\non  to their children, thus having the effect of reducing\r\n\r\nthe  incentive  to save and invest.  A lot  of  time  and\r\n\r\neffort are spent evolving schemes to legally avoid estate\r\n\r\nduty   by   transferring  wealth  outside  Singapore   to\r\n\r\ncountries,  like  Malaysia, Australia  and  India,  where\r\n\r\nestate duties have been abolished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the amount raised by taxation is very small\r\n\r\ncompared to other forms of revenue, would the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance  consider  abolishing  estate  duty?   Abolishing\r\n\r\nestate duty will not only attract foreign investments but\r\n\r\nalso   encourage  hard  work,  saving  habit   and   also\r\n\r\nstrengthen our family values.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, the Budget to exempt foreign\r\n\r\nincome gives exemptions on dividends, branch profits  and\r\n\r\nservice fees, but does not cover employment income earned\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad.  By exempting all employment income brought\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore,  it  will  remove  the  uncertainty  and\r\n\r\nadministrative  inconvenience of  individuals  having  to\r\n\r\nprove  they are migrants who apply for the Not Ordinarily\r\n\r\nResident  (NOR) incentive, or claim foreign tax  credits.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case of employment income, round tripping should\r\n\r\nnot be an issue.  The revenue lost to Singapore, however,\r\n\r\nif  any, should also be insignificant as these funds  are\r\n\r\nnot likely to be remitted to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an increasingly globalised workforce and\r\n\r\nbusiness  environment, many Singaporeans  may  also  have\r\n\r\nmultiple  income  sources, including earned  income  from\r\n\r\nabroad.    Exempting  foreign  employment  income   would\r\n\r\nencourage locals to venture outside Singapore and, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  the  additional  funds  remitted  back  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  may  also help to boost the wealth  management\r\n\r\nindustry in Singapore.  Could this be considered?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the NOR scheme, where there are concessions for\r\n\r\nmigrants which exempt foreign income, it applies only  to\r\n\r\nfirst-time foreigners to Singapore.  They do not  attract\r\n\r\nreturning  Singaporeans and foreigners who may  have  the\r\n\r\nneeded  skills  and  talents to  relocate  to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also  uncertainty in the  application  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me divide it into two categories of\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  One, on the conceptual issue; and two,  on\r\n\r\nthe implementation side of things.  The key difficulty in\r\n\r\nthe NOR concept itself is its numerous administrative and\r\n\r\ntechnical  hassle.  First, the minimum 90  business  days\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore.  It has always been  argued  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse   that   Singapore's   personal   tax   rates   are\r\n\r\nsufficiently competitive.  However, the feedback from the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community is that in Hong Kong, where tax  rate\r\n\r\nand days-in and days-out incentive is attractive and easy\r\n\r\nto manage, it is still perceived as far more competitive.\r\n\r\nThis  is  in spite of the recently announced increase  in\r\n\r\nthe personal tax rate to 17.5% in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, where the conveniences of communication\r\n\r\nlinks  would  reduce the necessity to travel thus  saving\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost, the requirement of 90 days may  place  an\r\n\r\nunnecessary  constraint  on  employees  who  may  have  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  regional  or global role, but  for  one  or  two\r\n\r\nyears,  they  are  spending less  than  90  days  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is also the five-year limit.\r\n\r\nExpatriates whose services and talents are still required\r\n\r\nafter  five years are probably those who are better value\r\n\r\nadded to the company and whose stay should be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThey are also mobile and sought after.  But the five-year\r\n\r\nlimit  de-incentivises the State.  It  could  perhaps  be\r\n\r\nreviewed.   Sir,  again, comparing  ourselves  with  Hong\r\n\r\nKong, they are one of our largest competitors as regional\r\n\r\nheadquarters.  Bearing in mind that regional headquarters\r\n\r\nare  essentially  service operations, relocation  is  not\r\n\r\ndifficult.   Most regional headquarters operations  would\r\n\r\nalso  absorb  an  expatriate's taxes  as  part  of  their\r\n\r\nemployment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperks and therefore form part of the employer's cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are running out of time, Miss Low.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> OK.

One single I know works very long hours\r\n\r\nas  an Executive Secretary.  She is afraid of losing  her\r\n\r\njob  as she is above 45.  So she works very hard to  earn\r\n\r\nher  keep so that she can support herself and her elderly\r\n\r\nmother  who lives with her.  As her mother gets more  and\r\n\r\nmore frail, she has no choice but to hire a maid.  If she\r\n\r\ndoes not, she fears she may lose her job.  There are many\r\n\r\nsingles like her.  They use up their Medisave and savings\r\n\r\nto  care  for  their  frail  parents,  leaving  less  for\r\n\r\nthemselves  in their own old age.  They have to  take  on\r\n\r\nthis  care giver role to relieve their siblings  who  are\r\n\r\nmarried with their own families.  At the same time,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  work very hard to support themselves and  their\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my block visits, I have met single women who\r\n\r\nhave  no choice but to quit their jobs to care for  their\r\n\r\nfrail  parents.  I am worried for them because I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether they will find it easy to get back  to  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  later.   Sir,  it is hard  to  understand  why\r\n\r\nsingles  are not allowed to claim the foreign  maid  levy\r\n\r\ntax  relief, while other working women can.   The  Second\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, Mr Lim Hng Kiang, has explained  to\r\n\r\nthe House earlier that the objective of the relief is  to\r\n\r\nencourage married women to continue working.  Hence,  the\r\n\r\nrelief is not available to singles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two points to make against this reasoning.\r\n\r\nFirst,  a  divorced woman can already claim maid  relief,\r\n\r\nand  a  divorced  woman is certainly not married,  or  it\r\n\r\nwould  be a contradiction in terms.  If a divorced  woman\r\n\r\ncan  claim tax relief for a foreign maid so that she  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  working, why not a single woman  who  also  has\r\n\r\nfamily  responsibilities, in this case,  caring  for  her\r\n\r\nparents?   Second, does the Government not want  to  also\r\n\r\nencourage  single  women with family responsibilities  to\r\n\r\ncontinue working?  The tax relief would help them  to  do\r\n\r\nso,  the  way  it helps married and divorced  women  with\r\n\r\nfamily responsibilities to continue working.  I urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to review this inconsistent policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> I would just\r\n\r\nlike to make a few remarks about the basis for tax.   The\r\n\r\nBudget now allows for deduction for start-up costs  which\r\n\r\nis  a move in the right direction, because this will  not\r\n\r\nonly  spur  new businesses but also align the  tax  views\r\n\r\nwith  the  way  businesses view  these  transactions  and\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, a lot of accounting\r\n\r\nstandards have also been introduced so that it closes the\r\n\r\ngap between accounting and the way businesses operated so\r\n\r\nas  to  ensure  that  financial  reporting  becomes  more\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  businesses as well.   But  businesses  have\r\n\r\nbecome  much  larger, much complex and also going  global\r\n\r\nand  regional.  That is the way our businesses are  going\r\n\r\nas  well.   Therefore, there is a need to close  the  gap\r\n\r\nbetween  a tax treatment, accounting treatment,  and  the\r\n\r\nway businesses see the way they operate as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to highlight a few instances where\r\n\r\nthere  are  differences.  For example,  in  the  area  of\r\n\r\nforeign exchange transactions.  More and more, with  fair\r\n\r\nvalue  accounting,  both unrealised  gains,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nlosses,  are included in the income statement.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  tax  treatment  is to continue treating  them  on  a\r\n\r\nrealised basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to bring up the situation\r\n\r\nabout cost of funding.  If you go\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand borrow money from the bank, interest is allowed.  But\r\n\r\nif  you decide to go through a different route and obtain\r\n\r\nfunding  through shares, or bonds, the cost of borrowing,\r\n\r\nthe cost of funding is not allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the area of financial services\r\n\r\ninstitutions, this is very important to Singapore and  is\r\n\r\nan  area we would like to develop.  More and more complex\r\n\r\ninstruments  and derivatives are being developed.   There\r\n\r\nis  a  huge  gap even in accounting, but certainly  taxed\r\n\r\nwith  the way these products have developed.  So the  tax\r\n\r\nview must be also aligned with the way these products are\r\n\r\nbeing developed.  So, in short, I would like to urge that\r\n\r\ntax  accounting, as well as businesses, look at all these\r\n\r\ntransactions with the same set of eyes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Cynthia Phua is not here. Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, tax on clubs and\r\n\r\nassociations.   Most,  if  not  all,  member  clubs   and\r\n\r\nassociations, that is, non-proprietary clubs,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  registered under the Societies Act, are non-profit\r\n\r\nmaking organisations.  They survive financially mainly on\r\n\r\nentrance  fees and monthly subscriptions.  There  is  tax\r\n\r\nimposed   on   clubs.   Could  the  Government   consider\r\n\r\nreviewing the imposition of tax on member clubs  as  most\r\n\r\nof them are just surviving financially, especially during\r\n\r\nthese  difficult times?  And many of them  do  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ncharitable  work and also yeoman service for  the  State.\r\n\r\nThis  is especially so when it comes to jackpot or  fruit\r\n\r\nmachines found in the clubs.  There is tax of, I believe,\r\n\r\nabout 43% of the gross takings of each jackpot machine in\r\n\r\neach  of  these clubs.  Could these rules be reviewed  by\r\n\r\nthe  authorities so that there will be no  tax,  or  that\r\n\r\nthere will be a reduction in tax, to save an enormous tax\r\n\r\nof 5% or 10% of the gross takings of jackpot machines?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I am informed that there is a requirement now\r\n\r\nthat member clubs must deposit a sum of $10,000 cash  per\r\n\r\njackpot   machine   with   the  income   tax   authority.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if the club has 10 jackpot machines, that club\r\n\r\nmust pay $100,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncash  and  that  is going to be very difficult  for  most\r\n\r\nclubs.    I  understand  the  tax  authority  may   allow\r\n\r\ninstalment  terms,  where there is an  application  made.\r\n\r\nWhy  the  need for this deposit when there were  no  such\r\n\r\nrules  all  these years, I believe?  Would the Government\r\n\r\nkindly  consider  waiving this sum?  If  not,  would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider reducing the deposit required  to  a\r\n\r\nlower  sum,  say,  about $1,000 per machine,  instead  of\r\n\r\n$10,000?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, why can we not have a provision for a banker's\r\n\r\nguarantee to be provided in lieu of payment of  cash  and\r\n\r\nthis  should be allowed because most clubs cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto cough up that large amount?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the ERC Report spelt out\r\n\r\nits  stand  on  GLCs, and I am happy  to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  planning to divest a few of  its  smaller\r\n\r\nGLCs,  which  the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned  during\r\n\r\nthe Budget speech.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, Temasek\r\n\r\nhas  not  demonstrated an urgency to do the same for  its\r\n\r\ngroup  of companies.  And I would like to suggest  a  few\r\n\r\nthings  on GLCs.  I am sad to note that very few  Members\r\n\r\nare talking about GLCs.  They seem to have abandoned this\r\n\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of divestment of TLCs, the\r\n\r\nMinister  should  set a target and that the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance   should   monitor  the  progress   against   the\r\n\r\ntimetable.  It is up to the Minister whether he wants  to\r\n\r\nshare this with the public, in terms of the timetable and\r\n\r\nthe  ability to meet this timetable.  But someone  should\r\n\r\nbe driving this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is on Temasek Holdings: whether it\r\n\r\nis  too much of a risk for all of us to put all our  eggs\r\n\r\nin  one  basket.   Is  it  a risk  to  have  all  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  companies being held under Temasek  Holdings?\r\n\r\nI  would  like to suggest that we consider the option  of\r\n\r\nsplitting  Temasek  into  a  few  vehicles.   The   added\r\n\r\nadvantage  is  that  we can create  competition  and  the\r\n\r\npressure  for  all  the Government holding  companies  to\r\n\r\nperform better because there is competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Government, as a shareholder, doing\r\n\r\nabout loss making GLCs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome  of  them  are among the worst performing  in  their\r\n\r\nindustry  for  the  last few years.

Recently,  I  came\r\n\r\nacross  a  couple  of Annual Reports and  IPO  prospectus\r\n\r\nwhich  revealed that there were some loans to GLCs  which\r\n\r\nwere  under  favourable terms. I also note  that  in  the\r\n\r\ndiscussion of the FTA with the USA, this issue  was  also\r\n\r\nraised.   I  also  recently had  some  feedback  from  an\r\n\r\nAmerican-run   SME   in  Singapore   about   the   unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition faced from a GLC (in this case,  not  a  TLC,\r\n\r\nbut  a smaller GLC which is not listed).  His concern was\r\n\r\nthat the GLC was competing successfully, particularly  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  tenders, because it has less than  commercial\r\n\r\nfunding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Amy Khor is not here.

This  was the result of  corporate  failures\r\n\r\ninvolving  conglomerates,  such  as  Enron,  K-Mart   and\r\n\r\nWorld.com.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have had the privilege of attending a top\r\n\r\nmanagement forum in Japan recently, where a large  number\r\n\r\nof  senior executives from Asia were gathered to  discuss\r\n\r\nthis crucial topic of preserving public trust in business\r\n\r\ncorporations.   The  culmination of  the  forum  was  the\r\n\r\ncrafting   of  a  roadmap  for  excellence  in  corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance for Asian businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While corporate governance is particularly important\r\n\r\nand  especially relevant for public-listed  companies,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  advocate that a framework for  corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance for SMEs in Singapore be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloped and embraced as a best practice.  The framework\r\n\r\nneed  not  be  as  sophisticated as that  prescribed  for\r\n\r\npublic  companies, but a simplified version  which  would\r\n\r\nenable   SMEs  to  understand  the  importance  of   good\r\n\r\ngovernance.   Such a framework would not only  help  SMEs\r\n\r\nnavigate  their companies better in terms  of  compliance\r\n\r\nwith   all  relevant  laws  and  regulations  but,   more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  would  help  to increase  confidence  among\r\n\r\ninvestors  to  put  their money  in  well-run  and  well-governed  companies, and make our SMEs more appealing  to\r\n\r\ninvestors  to help them grow more rapidly.  A strong  SME\r\n\r\nsector   will  not  only  provide  more  jobs  but   also\r\n\r\ncontribute  more  to our GDP.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister and Minister for  Finance  if  he\r\n\r\ncould   consider   introducing  a  corporate   governance\r\n\r\nmentorship scheme with a panel of advisers which SMEs can\r\n\r\nsubscribe to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we actively promote entrepreneurship in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it is also incumbent upon us to help them grow\r\n\r\nand become successful organisations.  Research reports do\r\n\r\nindicate  that well-governed companies are more appealing\r\n\r\nto investors, which can help them grow quickly, and those\r\n\r\nwhich  are  already publicly listed command  share  price\r\n\r\npremiums of 20% over and above the average companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir, first, on the topic of estate duty, this has been\r\n\r\nraised several times.  Let me just lay out the principles\r\n\r\nbehind our continuing the estate duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we agree that the collection of estate\r\n\r\nduty  is  not  very  significant.  It  is  around  $70-80\r\n\r\nmillion, but it is still not a small sum of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the cost of administration is not very\r\n\r\nhigh.  It is not as cost effective as collecting GST, but\r\n\r\nbe assured that the cost of administration for collecting\r\n\r\nestate  duty is not high and is still worth our while  to\r\n\r\ncollect this duty.  But, more importantly, the reason for\r\n\r\nretaining the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestate duty is the sense of social equity that we want to\r\n\r\nkeep  in  Singapore.  Many Members here have  highlighted\r\n\r\nthe  trend of widening income and wealth gap between  the\r\n\r\nrich  and the poor in Singapore.  This is likely to widen\r\n\r\nin  time.  We are lowering income tax.  We do not have  a\r\n\r\nwealth tax.  We do not have a capital gains tax.  So,  if\r\n\r\nwe  remove  estate  duty, I think we  would  not  have  a\r\n\r\nvehicle to make sure that this social equity objective is\r\n\r\nkept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries which have done away with estate\r\n\r\nduty  would  normally  keep  some  form  of  wealth  tax,\r\n\r\nprincipally capital gains tax, inheritance tax  or  other\r\n\r\nforms  of  wealth  tax, such as  a  gift  tax.   So,  the\r\n\r\nquestion is: what is the best way to collect such  a  tax\r\n\r\nto  achieve  this social equity objective?  In Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  believe that between wealth tax and inheritance  tax,\r\n\r\nwealth  tax  is  a more effective way of collecting.   We\r\n\r\ncollect  it  at the point of death, from one person,  ie,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  deceased, whereas inheritance tax  has  to  be\r\n\r\ncollected from all those who inherit the wealth.  But  we\r\n\r\nare  looking  at  it and we will see  what  is  the  most\r\n\r\neffective or the least disruptive way of collecting it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members mentioned that very few people are\r\n\r\nliable  for  paying  estate  duty.   That  is  the  whole\r\n\r\nintention, ie, that estate duty is only targetted at  the\r\n\r\nmore  well-to-do.  In fact, only 14% of estates  assessed\r\n\r\nin  the year 2001 were actually dutiable.  So, it is only\r\n\r\ntargetted at the rich.  The rates are low, between 5% and\r\n\r\n10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have complained about the long and costly\r\n\r\nprocess of people having to pay the estate duty.  This is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we  are  very  conscious  of,  and  IRAS\r\n\r\nregularly  reviews the procedures to try  and  make  this\r\n\r\nless of a hassle.  Early this year, for example, IRAS had\r\n\r\na  roundtable  with  five  estate  duty  lawyers  to  get\r\n\r\nfeedback and to look at some of these procedures.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure the House that IRAS will continue to look at these\r\n\r\nprocedures and try and make this less cumbersome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether estate duty will lead to wealth\r\n\r\nleaving Singapore is something we are also very conscious\r\n\r\nof.  That\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the  reason why the exemption limits are  set  fairly\r\n\r\nhigh,  both for residential property as well as for  cash\r\n\r\nand  other  assets.   Some Members pointed  out  that  as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans become richer, the $600,000 exemption  limit\r\n\r\nmay be due for review.  We will obviously look at this as\r\n\r\ntime  goes on.  Whether the fact that we have estate duty\r\n\r\nwill deter foreigners from bringing their wealth here, we\r\n\r\nhave taken that feedback, and Members would realise that,\r\n\r\nfor  foreigners, estate duty is not imposed  on  moveable\r\n\r\nassets.   So,  there is no deterrence to  their  bringing\r\n\r\ntheir  assets to Singapore.  They will not be covered  by\r\n\r\nthe  $600,000  asset  limit, as  long  as  they  are  not\r\n\r\nmoveable assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to foreign income exemption. As the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister explained, exempting foreign source\r\n\r\nincome is a very major change in our tax system.  We have\r\n\r\nbeen very reluctant to do this for many, many years.   We\r\n\r\nare now taking a very significant step.  But, as with all\r\n\r\nbig  steps, I think it would be prudent for us to  do  so\r\n\r\ncautiously,  because of the risk of  round  tripping  and\r\n\r\nerosion of our tax base.  So, the way we have gone  about\r\n\r\nit  is  to  exempt foreign source income  for  businesses\r\n\r\nfirst for the three groups of income.  The reason why  we\r\n\r\nhave  not  extended  it to employment income  is  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  greater scope for individuals  to  disguise\r\n\r\npassive  source income as employment income, as it  would\r\n\r\nbe  very  difficult  for us to trace the  source  of  the\r\n\r\nincome  remitted,  whether the  income  is  from  foreign\r\n\r\nemployment  or  bank deposits.  So, we have  started  off\r\n\r\nfirst  by  allowing this for businesses rather  than  for\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Miss Penny Low pointed out, for individuals, we\r\n\r\nreally are depending on the Not Ordinarily Resident (NOR)\r\n\r\nscheme  as a way of targetting and attracting top  talent\r\n\r\nto  come  to  Singapore.  Again, we have approached  this\r\n\r\ncautiously, and that is the reason why there are some  of\r\n\r\nthese  rules, whether it is the 90-day rule, 5-year limit\r\n\r\nor the other rules for the NOR scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to explain the reasoning behind these rules, we\r\n\r\nhave people who are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax  resident in Singapore, and the NOR scheme is  really\r\n\r\nto  target the top talents who are now not currently  tax\r\n\r\nresident  to relocate to Singapore.  For such  groups  of\r\n\r\npeople,  I  think  the scheme is not meant  for  all  and\r\n\r\nsundry.  It is really for the top talents.  For them, the\r\n\r\n90-day  rule is to make sure that as long as  they  spend\r\n\r\nmore  than  90 days or about 1/4 of their time  overseas,\r\n\r\nthen  that part proportionately will not be taxed by  us.\r\n\r\nThe  5-year limit is that we want to encourage  such  top\r\n\r\ntalents  to  eventually be a PR here.   I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nMembers  want a scheme which has no time limit  and  they\r\n\r\nperpetually  make  full use of this scheme.   Eventually,\r\n\r\nour  aim  is that such talents should sink some roots  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and be a tax resident or PR in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low also asked about the headline tax\r\n\r\nnumber.   This  is one of the precautions we  put  in  to\r\n\r\nprevent  a round-tripping.  We could have done away  with\r\n\r\nsuch  a rule and then evaluate each of the cases as  they\r\n\r\ncome  in.  But having a headline tax rule makes it  quite\r\n\r\nclear   to  the  businesses  that,  if  they  come   from\r\n\r\njurisdictions  which are clearly tax  havens,  then  they\r\n\r\nwill not be allowed to make use of this incentive that we\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng raised the point about foreign maid levy\r\n\r\nfor singles caring for their elderly parents.  I think it\r\n\r\nis  a separate issue.  As I explained previously, the tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for a foreign maid levy is really a marriage  and\r\n\r\nprocreation incentive and, therefore, it tells the career\r\n\r\nwomen  that  they continue to work even  after  they  get\r\n\r\nmarried  and have children, because then they would  have\r\n\r\nthis tax relief, they can have a maid to look after their\r\n\r\nchildren.   The  two points that Ms Irene Ng  made,  that\r\n\r\ndivorced women are covered but not singles.  But divorced\r\n\r\nwomen  are  different from singles.   Singles  are  never\r\n\r\nmarried.   The  divorced women were  previously  married.\r\n\r\nSo,  the  divorced women obviously are entitled  to  this\r\n\r\nscheme, because they meet the objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we do want to encourage the singles to\r\n\r\nlook  after  the elderly, and we do want the  singles  to\r\n\r\ncontinue working.  For that reason, we have the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparent  relief  and the handicapped parent relief,  which\r\n\r\nare meant to provide some form of relief to the taxpayers\r\n\r\nto  take care of their aged parents.  As we all know, the\r\n\r\nparent  relief  is  $5,000 for each parent  and,  if  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer is not staying with the parent, then the  relief\r\n\r\nis  reduced to $3,500 for each parent.  And if the parent\r\n\r\nis  handicapped, then the taxpayer is allowed to claim an\r\n\r\nadditional relief of $3,000 for each parent.  Whether  or\r\n\r\nnot these reliefs are sufficient to address the needs  of\r\n\r\na  growing number of singles who are looking after  their\r\n\r\nparents,  that is an important issue, separate  from  the\r\n\r\nforeign maid levy, and I think it is worthwhile for us to\r\n\r\nlook  at  this whole issue of ageing parents  and  people\r\n\r\nlooking after aged parents.  All of us are aware that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  society that responsibility largely  falls  on\r\n\r\nthe daughters and, with a significant percentage of women\r\n\r\nbeing  single, it largely falls on the single  daughters,\r\n\r\namong all the siblings.  So, I think it is an issue  that\r\n\r\nis worth our further investigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fang Ai Lian raised the issue about aligning the\r\n\r\nbasis  for  tax  with that of accounting  practices.   In\r\n\r\nprinciple,  I  would have to agree.  There are  obviously\r\n\r\nmerits   to   have  convergence  of  tax  and  accounting\r\n\r\npractices, even though the objectives are different,  and\r\n\r\nboth are evolving, sometimes in different directions.  On\r\n\r\nthe  three  specific issues that she raised, I will  pass\r\n\r\nthem  to IRAS and ask them to study.  Foreign exchange  - why  is  it  a realised basis - that is one of the  basic\r\n\r\nprinciples of income tax, ie, it is tax based on realised\r\n\r\nbasis.   So, I think there are some sound bases on  which\r\n\r\nIRAS sets its rules.  But, just as IRAS continuously  has\r\n\r\ndialogues and discussions with the practitioners, as they\r\n\r\ndo,  say,  with  the  estate  duty  lawyers,  they  would\r\n\r\ndefinitely talk to the accountants and tax accountants to\r\n\r\nmake   sure  that  there  is  better  alignment  of   the\r\n\r\npractices.   We  want to make the tax  rules  as  simple,\r\n\r\nsensible and business applicable as possible.  So, I will\r\n\r\nask  them  to  take up these three areas which  Mrs  Fang\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan raised the topic about clubs.\r\n\r\nBasically,  the  principle is the  beneficiaries  of  the\r\n\r\nclub.    If   the  objective  of  the  club  is   largely\r\n\r\ncharitable,  benefitting the community at large,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink there are grounds for us to look at the income  and\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  they  should be paying  tax.   In  such\r\n\r\nsituations,  my advice to the club is to set up  separate\r\n\r\nentities or funds, so that if they undertake projects for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  the community as a whole,  then  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter  for  it  to  set it up as a  separate  non-profit\r\n\r\norganisation  for charitable activities.  Of  course,  if\r\n\r\n80%  of  the income they raise is put to charitable  use,\r\n\r\nthen  it would not attract tax.  But if the club is meant\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of its members and not the community  at\r\n\r\nlarge, then one would see that there is a reason for them\r\n\r\nto be treated just like any other entity and pay tax. The\r\n\r\nrule that IRAS has is whether or not the source of income\r\n\r\nof  the  club is largely from subscriptions and from  the\r\n\r\nmembers themselves.  If more than 50% of the income comes\r\n\r\ndirectly   from  subscriptions  and  from   the   members\r\n\r\nthemselves, it collects that income and then it  uses  it\r\n\r\nfor  its  members, then, of course, it would not  attract\r\n\r\nincome  tax.   But if more than 50% of the  income  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  non-members, then obviously, the  club  is  running\r\n\r\nsome kind of business, catering to non-members.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also raised the point about jackpot\r\n\r\nmachines.   Jackpot machines for most clubs are  revenue-generating and, therefore, the Government has  a  tax  on\r\n\r\nthe earnings, and the Government also has a deposit.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  true  that this deposit has not been  previously\r\n\r\ninstituted.    The  IRAS  has  always  had   a   deposit.\r\n\r\nPreviously,  the  deposit was $5,000  per  machine  since\r\n\r\n1967.   Recently,  we  have had  this  spate  of  jackpot\r\n\r\nmachines in all kinds of premises, the so-called football\r\n\r\nclubs.   So,  between the Ministry of  Home  Affairs  and\r\n\r\nIRAS,  we have sat down and tightened up the rules.   One\r\n\r\nof  the  rules  being tightened is to  enforce  a  higher\r\n\r\ndeposit of $10,000.  If you look at just inflation alone,\r\n\r\nfrom 1967 to now, just catering for inflation,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  deposit should have been raised to $13,000 and  not\r\n\r\n$10,000.   So,  $10,000  deposit  is  just  catering  for\r\n\r\ninflation.  I think the deposit is necessary to make sure\r\n\r\nthat  clubs which have these machines use these  machines\r\n\r\nfor bona fide purposes and not as a basis for gambling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh raised several issues about GLCs.\r\n\r\nFirst,  he would like the Minister for Finance to have  a\r\n\r\ntimetable,  deadline  or target, if not  articulated,  at\r\n\r\nleast  internally.  DPM has explained this  before.   The\r\n\r\ncriteria  by  which  Temasek  holds  on  or  divests  its\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  been  outlined in the  Temasek  Charter.\r\n\r\nQuite frankly, there are not very many major companies to\r\n\r\nbe  divested  but  it  is unwise to  name  the  potential\r\n\r\ncandidates or set a timetable publicly because that would\r\n\r\ndemoralise  the  staff  and  depress  the  value  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.   But I can assure the Member that internally,\r\n\r\nbetween MOF and Temasek, we do monitor the implementation\r\n\r\nof the Temasek Charter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he asked is whether or not we\r\n\r\nshould  split  Temasek  into a few  vehicles  instead  of\r\n\r\nconcentrating just on Temasek Holdings.  Let  me  explain\r\n\r\nagain.  Temasek Holdings is a holding company.  The  main\r\n\r\nthrust  of  the  company is in the  operating  companies,\r\n\r\nwhether  listed or not listed. Temasek is just a  holding\r\n\r\ncompany.   The main role of Temasek Holdings is really  a\r\n\r\nstewardship  role  and  to look after  the  interests  of\r\n\r\nGovernment as a shareholder in these companies.  So it is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary to split Temasek into different  companies\r\n\r\nbecause   the  work  is  really  done  by  the  operating\r\n\r\ncompanies, whether it is SIA or the other companies.   If\r\n\r\nwe  split Temasek into several holding companies, it does\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily  mean  that  it  would  lead  to  better\r\n\r\nperformance   of  the  Temasek-linked  companies.    More\r\n\r\nlikely,   it   would  just  increase  overheads.    Quite\r\n\r\ncandidly, the main problem we all face is talent.  If  we\r\n\r\nsplit  Temasek  into several vehicles, we would  have  to\r\n\r\nstart looking for several very high calibre people to run\r\n\r\nthese companies and to provide the stewardship role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked about loss-making TLCs and\r\n\r\nwhat the Govern-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nment   should   be   doing  about  it.   Basically,   the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the Temasek-linked companies  should  be\r\n\r\ndealt  with  on  a case-by-case basis, based  on  a  peer\r\n\r\ncomparison  within the same industry.  The Temasek-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies  face the same kind of risks and  difficulties,\r\n\r\nlike all other companies during this downturn and, in the\r\n\r\nnature of things, not all Temasek-linked companies  would\r\n\r\nbe  profitable  or  that they would be  profitable  every\r\n\r\nyear.   When  we look at Temasek-linked companies,  as  a\r\n\r\nshareholder, we have to look at it holistically and  over\r\n\r\na time period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the Temasek-linked companies have performed\r\n\r\nreasonably well and, if there are specific problems  with\r\n\r\nthe   companies'  performance  or  fundamentals,  Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings would work with the board of directors to review\r\n\r\nthe  industry's prospects and to chart out new  strategic\r\n\r\ndirections.   If necessary, the board may  need  to  make\r\n\r\nmanagement changes, or Temasek, as shareholder, may  need\r\n\r\nto make the board changes.  Losses in the company, as far\r\n\r\nas  shareholders are concerned, would only  be  tolerated\r\n\r\nfor  a period of time and, if the board or the management\r\n\r\ndoes  not  give confidence to the shareholders that  they\r\n\r\ncan  turn  around  the situation, then obviously,  action\r\n\r\nwould have to be taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Temasek holds the Board and management of\r\n\r\nthe   Temasek-linked  companies  accountable  for   their\r\n\r\nindividual performance, the Government also holds Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings    accountable   for   the   overall   long-term\r\n\r\nperformance of its portfolio of companies.  To that  end,\r\n\r\nMOF monitors Temasek's performance closely, and would not\r\n\r\nhesitate  to  make  board or management  changes,  should\r\n\r\nthese be necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point which Mr Inderjit Singh made was\r\n\r\nabout  unfair competition and loans and grants  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  If there are specific instances, we would be\r\n\r\nhappy  for him to highlight to us.  But just as a general\r\n\r\nrule,  the Government's policy is to require the Temasek-linked companies to operate on a purely commercial  basis\r\n\r\nwithout  any  special treatment from the Government.   We\r\n\r\nexpect the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTemasek-linked companies to raise funds that they need on\r\n\r\na commercial basis.  But if Government has schemes run by\r\n\r\nEDB  or  any  other  agencies that are available  to  all\r\n\r\ncompanies, then Members would also agree that  we  should\r\n\r\nnot deny Temasek-linked companies to avail themselves  of\r\n\r\nsuch   schemes,   just  like  any  other  Singapore-based\r\n\r\ncompanies.    But   like  any  other  applications,   the\r\n\r\napplications from Temasek-linked companies would have  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  all  the  qualifying  criteria  of  the  various\r\n\r\nschemes and be assessed on their own merits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad raised very good points about\r\n\r\ncorporate governance. I think we all agree with him  that\r\n\r\nit is important for all Singapore companies to adopt good\r\n\r\ncorporate  governance  practices.   The  Government   has\r\n\r\nplaced  more  emphasis  on  the corporate  governance  of\r\n\r\nlisted  companies  because they have public  shareholders\r\n\r\nand there are greater public interests at stake.  And  it\r\n\r\nis therefore appropriate that these companies comply with\r\n\r\nmore   stringent  corporate  governance   standards   and\r\n\r\ndisclosure  requirements.  This is  consistent  with  the\r\n\r\napproach taken in the leading jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For private companies, especially small companies\r\n\r\nwhere all the shareholders are also directors, we need to\r\n\r\nstrike a balance between having high corporate governance\r\n\r\nstandards  and keeping business costs low.  But  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Magad completely that it is in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe   companies  themselves  to  observe  good  corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance standards because, if they aspire to grow into\r\n\r\nlisted  companies and to multi-national  companies,  then\r\n\r\nobviously this would stand them in good stead.   I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  him  that  studies  have shown  that  institutional\r\n\r\ninvestors  are  prepared to pay a premium  for  companies\r\n\r\nwith  good corporate governance practices.  Now, we  have\r\n\r\nthis  set of corporate governance rules. We can  look  at\r\n\r\nthem  and  see  whether  a  simplified  version  can   be\r\n\r\napplicable  to the SMEs.  This is something worth  taking\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, his suggestion about a mentorship scheme is, I\r\n\r\nthink, worth considering.  I am\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsure that we would take this up, whether by ourselves  or\r\n\r\nby Mr Raymond Lim's committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, many\r\n\r\nunfavourable  corporate developments have reinforced  the\r\n\r\nneed  for risk management and compliance, and regulations\r\n\r\nhave given the respective authorities the necessary teeth\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  breaches.   And  as  banks  have  figured\r\n\r\nprominently in most of these developments, they are under\r\n\r\nthe  spotlight. The intent is justified - it is the risks\r\n\r\nof  over-regulation that we have to guard against.  It is\r\n\r\nalso  a  question  of  whether  the  substance  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved,  as opposed to merely ensuring compliance  with\r\n\r\nthe form.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few years back, some incidents took place\r\n\r\nwhich required, amongst other things, Chinese walls to be\r\n\r\nput up between certain departments in a typical financial\r\n\r\ninstitution,  for  example, between fund  management  and\r\n\r\ninvestment  banking.   Compliance was  the  buzzword  and\r\n\r\ninterior decorators received a minor boost in demand - up\r\n\r\nwent  walls  and doors, as well as the number  of  curses\r\n\r\nwhen  people forgot to bring their card-keys along,  just\r\n\r\nwalking  to the toilets.  Even during the market downturn\r\n\r\nwhere   banks   were  downsizing,  compliance   resources\r\n\r\nballooned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zeal has been observed for the listed companies,\r\n\r\nincluding  banks,  where more and more  rules  have  been\r\n\r\nimposed as best practices, especially in the wake of  the\r\n\r\ncorporate misdeeds in the US which were referred to by my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Mr  Magad, just now.  And yet more  reporting\r\n\r\nand  more  disclosure have been required.  Disclosure  is\r\n\r\nfine but to a point of negative utility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has rightly placed emphasis on\r\n\r\nregulations and compliance.  But I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister  how do we  guard  against  over-regulation  through  rules and yet more  rules,  and  the\r\n\r\nattendant  rising  compliance cost.   A  high  compliance\r\n\r\nburden,  whilst  ensuring  our standing  as  a  financial\r\n\r\ncentre\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof integrity, can erode our competitiveness and vibrancy.\r\n\r\nAre there sanity checks and are benchmarks used?  How  do\r\n\r\nwe  balance  the costs of compliance with  the  risks  of\r\n\r\nsomething going wrong?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, on local and foreign\r\n\r\nbank  licences.   The  granting of banking  licences  for\r\n\r\nlocal  and  foreign banks is controlled by  the  Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority  of  Singapore.  There  are  only  a  few  bank\r\n\r\nlicences granted by the State.  Generally speaking, there\r\n\r\nis a great deal of money being made by the banks over the\r\n\r\nyears,  compared  to other industries,  and  even  during\r\n\r\nrecessionary periods.  There must therefore  follow  that\r\n\r\nbenefits  must  also  bring in good  deeds,  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and  assisting the  customers  of  banks.\r\n\r\nWhen times are bad, I think there is a responsibility  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  banks to reconsider - although  one  could\r\n\r\nargue that it is not feasible, in terms of making profits\r\n\r\n-  the  duty  of  the banks towards the  nation  and  its\r\n\r\ncitizens.   Therefore,  the  interest  rates  should   be\r\n\r\nreconsidered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the State cannot govern what the banks\r\n\r\nshould  do, there must be an imposition of some  sort  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that they are fair about the interest  rates.\r\n\r\nIf  the  interest rates being charged or being  given  to\r\n\r\ncustomers are at a very low end, then the interest  rates\r\n\r\nto  be  charged  for borrowing of money, mortgages,  etc,\r\n\r\nshould also be reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to raise is that the\r\n\r\nbank  licences  that  are given by the  State  are  given\r\n\r\nsparingly. In this connection, there is only that  number\r\n\r\nof bank directors.  I think it is important to spread the\r\n\r\nwealth  of the nation amongst the citizenry.  If we  look\r\n\r\nat  directors  of banks, they are only a  limited  number\r\n\r\nover  the  last  10-20 years or so.   Perhaps  the  State\r\n\r\nshould consider whether a banker should be allowed to  be\r\n\r\na director for a certain number of years, beyond which it\r\n\r\nshould be then spread to other bankers.  In this way, the\r\n\r\nexperience is spread and wealth is also spread.  I  would\r\n\r\nurge  therefore - although maybe not compulsorily made  - that  in  some  form, the bankers, who are  directors  of\r\n\r\nbanks,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  have a limited span of, say, 10-15 years  at  the\r\n\r\nmost in the banking industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Penny Low, please take both cuts\r\n\r\nat one go.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I would like to withdraw my\r\n\r\ncut on trust industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Okay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, first let me declare my\r\n\r\ninterest   as  an  insider  of  the  financial   advisory\r\n\r\nindustry.   Singapore in its drive to be  a  global  best\r\n\r\npractice  financial centre has introduced  the  Financial\r\n\r\nAdvisers  Act  last year.  I would like to highlight  two\r\n\r\npractical  difficulties faced by the financial  advisers,\r\n\r\nas well as their clients.  Currently the title \"Financial\r\n\r\nAdviser\"   is   used  indiscriminately.   There   is   no\r\n\r\ndifferentiation between a full-licensed holder, that  is,\r\n\r\none  who holds all the licences for securities, insurance\r\n\r\nand   other  trades,  and  those  who  specialise  in   a\r\n\r\nparticular  field.   Banks, insurance  companies,  stock-broking firms, merchant banks and so on and so forth  are\r\n\r\nexempt  financial advisers, and therefore representatives\r\n\r\nof  such organisations can also call themselves financial\r\n\r\nadvisers regardless if their qualifications allow them to\r\n\r\njust market an insurance product or execute a trade for a\r\n\r\nclient,  or  both.  As such, clients may be misguided  by\r\n\r\nthe  term or even misled by the representation.  Although\r\n\r\nthere are disclosure guidelines in place, it is still not\r\n\r\nthe  modus  operandi  here in Singapore  and  done  on  a\r\n\r\ndiscretionary basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be less confusing, and perhaps better\r\n\r\nconsumer protection, if a differentiated use of the title\r\n\r\n\"adviser\" be put in place, for example, to have the title\r\n\r\nas  Financial  Adviser (Insurance), or  (Securities),  or\r\n\r\n(Full  Licence).   This  will  help  clients  better   to\r\n\r\nunderstand the adviser's qualifications and roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, many financial advisers have also expressed\r\n\r\ndeep  concern  about the steep punishment meted  out  for\r\n\r\nsmall  mistakes.  While I am in full support of the  need\r\n\r\nto protect consumers, I would also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncaution   against  an  over-kill  of  steep   rules   and\r\n\r\npunishment.  For example, in the Financial Advisers  Act,\r\n\r\nPart  III, an oversight in disclosing a prospectus  to  a\r\n\r\nclient can land the adviser with a $25,000 fine or a  12-month's  jail term.  In all fairness, it would be totally\r\n\r\nunacceptable  if the prospectus or funds are deliberately\r\n\r\nhidden  from the client, but this would have  been  quite\r\n\r\nunthinkable   as  the  advisory  process   itself   would\r\n\r\nnecessitate product explanation.  But in the event that a\r\n\r\ncopy  of  the  prospectus  was not  enclosed  during  the\r\n\r\ndelivery stage, or that the client does not take  away  a\r\n\r\ncopy  of  the prospectus after signing, would the penalty\r\n\r\nstill  apply?   Certainly, the intention of  the  law  is\r\n\r\ndeterrence,  and  it  is  important.   However,  not  all\r\n\r\nmistakes  are  criminal offences and the  penalty  should\r\n\r\nsend the right signal to reflect that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps even more dampening is the common perception\r\n\r\namongst  the professionals that once any client complains\r\n\r\nagainst   them  regarding  any  investment  or  insurance\r\n\r\nrelated  issue,  they  are already  guilty  until  proven\r\n\r\ninnocent.   Can  the  Ministry  put  a  balance  on  this\r\n\r\nperception  and  assure the industry  practitioners  that\r\n\r\nthere is a fair investigation process?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the spirit of the FAA.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there are some real implementation blues.   The\r\n\r\ncost  of compliance and fear of making mistakes may weigh\r\n\r\ndown  on  the  burgeoning industry and  kill  it  in  its\r\n\r\ninfancy.   Could  the  Minister  consider  reviewing  the\r\n\r\npractical issues of implementation of the FAA by refining\r\n\r\nthe definition of the notices?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  my cut as the Minister for Finance had  covered\r\n\r\nthat substantially during the Budget debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, let me first of all declare\r\n\r\nmy  interest in the subject matter as a solicitor engaged\r\n\r\nin this area of practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore to play an important role as an\r\n\r\ninternational finance centre it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrucial,  among other things, to maintain  itself  as  an\r\n\r\nattractive place for good quality companies in the region\r\n\r\nto  list.  Foreign listing of such companies helps to add\r\n\r\ngravitas   to  our  Stock  Exchange  and  also  encourage\r\n\r\nliquidity  and  higher level of investment activities  in\r\n\r\nthe  capital market.  However, the strategy of attracting\r\n\r\nforeign  companies to list in our capital market  is  not\r\n\r\nours  alone.   The  Singapore Exchange competes  directly\r\n\r\nwith  home  exchanges in countries where these  companies\r\n\r\nare   domiciled,  but  also  with  the  more  established\r\n\r\nexchanges like Nasdaq and Hong Kong Exchange.  These more\r\n\r\nestablished exchanges, with a much higher level of market\r\n\r\ncapitalisation  than  that  of  the  Singapore  Exchange,\r\n\r\nobviously have an advantage over us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to compete, Singapore must stand out from\r\n\r\nthe  other  exchanges.  To do that, there is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nmeasure   our   listing   environment   against   several\r\n\r\nyardsticks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the relative cost and inconvenience of\r\n\r\ngetting  a  company listed, and to stay  listed,  can  be\r\n\r\nrather  prohibitive.   To be fair, the  listing  cost  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is still cheaper than Hong Kong,  although  we\r\n\r\nare  more  expensive  than Shanghai.  However,  investors\r\n\r\ninterested  in  listing in Singapore would  soon  realise\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  inherent  difficulties  involved.    To\r\n\r\nmention  a  few,  under our present corporate  governance\r\n\r\ncode,  listed  companies in Singapore  must  now  provide\r\n\r\nquarterly  reporting  as  part  of  its  obligations  for\r\n\r\ngreater transparency.  Those of us who are involved  with\r\n\r\nlisted  companies  will attest to the  fact  that  public\r\n\r\nreporting  is  an  added expense that takes  up  quite  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial   part   of   the   management's   time   and\r\n\r\nprofessional resource, and certainly this is one negative\r\n\r\nfactor  that will well put off prospective issuers.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is,  whether we have considered  if  there  are\r\n\r\nalternative  ways  of  putting  out  information  without\r\n\r\nmaking  it  compulsory for all companies to report  on  a\r\n\r\nquarterly basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, under the new legislative framework,\r\n\r\nforecast financial statements in the prospectus  must  be\r\n\r\nbacked by an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpert   opinion   as  to  the  reasonableness   of   its\r\n\r\nassumption.   While  the policy is  well-meaning,  it  is\r\n\r\nunfortunate  that  the  policy  makers  did   not   fully\r\n\r\nappreciate whether there is anyone in the market  who  is\r\n\r\nprepared to assume the role of an expert.  In fact, after\r\n\r\nit  was  introduced,  no one, even the  accountants,  was\r\n\r\nprepared  to  assume  the role of the  expert.   After  a\r\n\r\nwhile, some accountants were prepared to provide such  an\r\n\r\nopinion, albeit at a price.  Some have been known to  ask\r\n\r\nfor  a  fee  of as high as $240,000 for a simple  written\r\n\r\nopinion.  Needless to say, many have been put off by  the\r\n\r\npotential additional expenditure.  Again, this is another\r\n\r\nexample  of  policy makers making policies without  fully\r\n\r\nappreciating the cost implications on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in drawing up our regulations on\r\n\r\nsecurities,  we  have sought to benchmark  our  standards\r\n\r\nagainst the best practices in the world.  These practices\r\n\r\nare  to  be  found in the West, in London and  New  York.\r\n\r\nHowever,   these  are  established  in  a   more   mature\r\n\r\njurisdiction  that understands the culture  of  corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance  and disclosure requirements.   On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, companies that Singapore promoters are targeting at\r\n\r\nare  those in India and China where precisely the culture\r\n\r\nof  corporate governance and disclosure requirements  may\r\n\r\nnot  be as mature as those in Western countries.  In such\r\n\r\na situation, we may well have to tweak our rules a little\r\n\r\nwithout   compromising  the  integrity  of  the   listing\r\n\r\nprocess.   In fact, stock exchanges that understand  this\r\n\r\ndifference would have a clear advantage over Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be necessary for the Singapore Exchange and\r\n\r\nMAS in such instances to exercise greater flexibility and\r\n\r\nhand-holding to help these companies to meet our  listing\r\n\r\nstandards  rather  than  to  play  the  part  of  a  mere\r\n\r\nregulator and enforcer.  In this regard, the MAS and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Exchange should play a role similar to the  EDB\r\n\r\nin   actively   wooing  and  courting  suitable   foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  list in Singapore.  If they  play  a  more\r\n\r\nactive  part, I believe our record of Chinese and  Indian\r\n\r\ncompanies listing here could well be better than  it  was\r\n\r\npreviously.  In fact, I am\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  to  understand that last year we did  not  have  a\r\n\r\nsingle Chinese company listed on our Stock Exchange,  and\r\n\r\nthat shows how difficult it is to get these companies  to\r\n\r\ncome  here.   I would therefore like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether more could be done to encourage foreign companies\r\n\r\nto  list here.  Perhaps it may be timely for us to do  an\r\n\r\nERC-type  review of the securities industry  to  consider\r\n\r\nhow Singapore can position itself as a centre for capital\r\n\r\nmarket activities in this part of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I agree with Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua  that it is most important that we maintain a balance\r\n\r\nbetween  having  good  rules  and  not  imposing  onerous\r\n\r\nburdens  on businesses.  We discussed this over the  last\r\n\r\ncouple  of  days  and  it  applies  particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  industry.   After Enron, World.com  and  other\r\n\r\ncorporate  disasters  in  the West,  the  attitudes  have\r\n\r\nchanged and the free-for-all approach of the dot.com  era\r\n\r\nhas been replaced by regulations, tightening up of rules,\r\n\r\nand  all  kinds of impositions.  And we are also  carried\r\n\r\nalong by this wave because we are plugged into the global\r\n\r\nmarkets and we cannot completely divorce our institutions\r\n\r\nfrom  the  practices elsewhere.  However, we have  to  be\r\n\r\nquite careful not to go unthinkingly with the latest fads\r\n\r\nand  fashions,  gather  from around  the  world  all  the\r\n\r\ntightest restrictions and put them together and call them\r\n\r\nbest practices.  Because if you do that, you are going to\r\n\r\nhave a system which looks good on paper but which is  not\r\n\r\nworkable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the other point which Mrs Lim pointed\r\n\r\nout, which is the political pressure on the Government to\r\n\r\ntighten up after problems are discovered.  Because if you\r\n\r\nare  going  on  a caveat emptor, management by  exception\r\n\r\nregime,  when  a problem appears, there is  bound  to  be\r\n\r\npolitical pressure to say that you should fix it and  not\r\n\r\nlet  it  happen  again.  Lock the door.   The  horse  has\r\n\r\nbolted.   And  each  time  you  add  these  padlocks  and\r\n\r\nrestrictions  you  are  adding  burdens  and   additional\r\n\r\ndifficulties on businesses.  And this can happen  to  all\r\n\r\njurisdictions.   In   Britain,  the  Financial   Services\r\n\r\nAuthority, which started off gathering together the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish   supervisory  authorities,  had  a   very   high\r\n\r\nreputation  for  being  able to supervise  with  a  light\r\n\r\ntouch,  to  allow  companies  to  carry  on  with   their\r\n\r\nbusinesses and implement caveat emptor. It has now caused\r\n\r\na  lot  of  concerns because they have  had  to  go  very\r\n\r\nheavily  into  consumer protection, regulations  on  mis-selling, clamping down on insurance companies, and people\r\n\r\nhaving  pension funds and so on, which is  not  promoting\r\n\r\nand  growing  the  industry  but  really  responding   to\r\n\r\npolitical pressures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic formula how we can avoid doing\r\n\r\nthis,  but  if  Members understand  this  and  the  risks\r\n\r\ninvolved,  then it will be easier for us  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nbalance.   When  things  are  going  well,  that  is  not\r\n\r\ndifficult.  The difficulty is after things had gone badly\r\n\r\nand you tell people \"caveat emptor, you took the risk and\r\n\r\nyou  have  to accept the consequences\", that is  when  we\r\n\r\nhave  to decide whether there is in fact something  wrong\r\n\r\nwith  the system which needs to be fixed, or whether this\r\n\r\nis  a spill which cannot be avoided if you are aiming for\r\n\r\nthe  thrills. The Government really should not  intervene\r\n\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan said that banking licences are\r\n\r\nissued  to  a privileged few and therefore banks  have  a\r\n\r\nsocial responsibility.  I think banks do have some social\r\n\r\nresponsibility  because they are very major  institutions\r\n\r\nin the financial system, and if they take a narrow profit\r\n\r\nview  of  their  purposes, then  we  are  going  to  have\r\n\r\nproblems.   But,  on  the  other  hand,  banks  are   not\r\n\r\ncharitable  organisations  either,  and  they  perform  a\r\n\r\nsocial  duty to reduce cost because we say, \"You have  to\r\n\r\ncarry  the  burden of extending loans to companies  which\r\n\r\nare  not  viable  because otherwise  the  companies  will\r\n\r\nsuffer.\"   It  is not viable.  The banks do  not  have  a\r\n\r\nlicence to print money.  Maybe if we have a closed system\r\n\r\nand  you have just two or three banks or a monopoly, that\r\n\r\nis possible.  We do not have a closed banking system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have issued new privileges to have qualifying\r\n\r\nfull  banks in Singapore.  So new entrants have come into\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  retail banking market.  Our wholesale  banking\r\n\r\nmarket is substantially open because there are dozens  of\r\n\r\nparticipants, 30-40 banks, and there is free  competition\r\n\r\nbetween  them.   So  there  is  no  monopoly  profit  nor\r\n\r\neconomic  rent  which  they are creaming  off  and  which\r\n\r\ntherefore  we have to regulate and manage.  In  fact,  if\r\n\r\nyou look at the retail banking sector, one of the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  the Singapore banks have merged into 3 instead of  7\r\n\r\nbanks,  which we had 6 years ago, is because  competition\r\n\r\nis   fierce  and  they  have  no  choice  but  to  merge,\r\n\r\nconsolidate  and reduce cost.  Having reduced  cost,  you\r\n\r\nfind that their earnings have not gone up.  Their returns\r\n\r\non  equity  or returns on assets stay about the  same  as\r\n\r\nbefore  and,  in  fact,  in some cases,  have  come  down\r\n\r\nbecause business conditions are quite difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the assumption that the banks are printing money\r\n\r\nand  therefore we should somehow or other  help  them  to\r\n\r\nspend  this  for  good causes, is  not  right.   And  the\r\n\r\nproposition  that because the banks are  rich,  therefore\r\n\r\nthe directors are also rich, and people should take turns\r\n\r\nbeing bank directors, I think that is not quite what bank\r\n\r\ndirectors  are meant to do and not how the system  works.\r\n\r\nThe  bank directors are there to ensure proper governance\r\n\r\nand  supervision of the bank, to make sure that they  are\r\n\r\noperating properly.  And you do not get rich by  becoming\r\n\r\na bank director.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low asked about financial advisers and\r\n\r\nwanting  to  put brackets after the term, say,  Financial\r\n\r\nAdviser  (Pension),  Financial  Adviser  (Insurance)   or\r\n\r\nsomething  like that.  We used to have that  system.   We\r\n\r\nused  to have different financial advisers for insurance,\r\n\r\nstock  broking  and other services. We decided  to  bring\r\n\r\nthem  altogether  under one licence because  we  want  to\r\n\r\nsimplify the licensing framework.  They all have the same\r\n\r\nlicence.   You  are  a financial adviser,  then  you  are\r\n\r\nqualified to do different things, depending on what  your\r\n\r\nskills  are, and therefore they are all called  financial\r\n\r\nadvisers.  But, according to our rules, regardless of the\r\n\r\ntitles   and   designations   used,   they   and    their\r\n\r\nrepresentative, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  case of banks, that means the employees  of  the\r\n\r\nbanks,  are required to disclose to clients the types  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  advisory services that they are authorised  to\r\n\r\nprovide under the Financial Advisers Act (FAA), and other\r\n\r\ntypes  of  activities carried out by them which  are  not\r\n\r\nregulated  by  MAS.  So there are some  safeguards.  They\r\n\r\nhave,  as a matter of duty, to disclose to their  clients\r\n\r\nwhat they are qualified to advise in.  I would rather not\r\n\r\nput  brackets  against their names.   Otherwise,  we  are\r\n\r\ntaking  a step backwards and making the licensing  scheme\r\n\r\nmore complicated.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know where Miss Low got the idea that if a\r\n\r\nperson  is accused of an offence as a financial  adviser,\r\n\r\nhe  is  guilty  until proven innocent.  It  is  a  common\r\n\r\nperception.  It must be like the serial numbers on ballot\r\n\r\npapers.   But we will try our best to dispel this  common\r\n\r\nperception.   It  is  totally  untrue.   There  are   due\r\n\r\nprocesses,  there are hearings, there  are  appeals.   We\r\n\r\nhave  panels and we are about to appoint people from  the\r\n\r\nprofession to the panel, so that if a case comes  up,  we\r\n\r\ncan  have  people who are knowledgable about the business\r\n\r\nwho will make a proper judgment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the punishments being too steep, eg,\r\n\r\nomissions  in  the prospectus, I do not know  about  this\r\n\r\nparticular  offence, but there are scales of  punishment.\r\n\r\nAnd  if any of them looks out of line, perhaps the Member\r\n\r\ncan  let  me  know  and we will look  into  it.   We  are\r\n\r\ncollecting  implementation experience on the  FAA,  which\r\n\r\nis,  after all, a new piece of legislation that came into\r\n\r\neffect  last  year.  It will need to be  fine-tuned.   We\r\n\r\nhave  proposed some amendments which are coming up  quite\r\n\r\nsoon.   If they could let me have their observations  and\r\n\r\nsuggestions,  we  will  look at them  and  if  there  are\r\n\r\nanomalies, we will try and iron them out as we go  along.\r\n\r\nComplex  legislation like this  -  several hundred  pages\r\n\r\nlong   - is always work in progress.  And by the time  we\r\n\r\nfinish tidying it up, it is time for a new revision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann talked about the cost of listing on\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Stock  Exchange,  and  he   particularly\r\n\r\nmentioned the issue of quarterly reporting.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nissue on which there are strong views on both sides.  The\r\n\r\npeople  who want to raise corporate governance  standards\r\n\r\nsay  this is becoming the norm and it does not cost a lot\r\n\r\nto  put  out the reports.  Because if people are  running\r\n\r\nthe company properly, they should have the quarterly data\r\n\r\nanyhow.  On the other hand, quite a number of the  people\r\n\r\nwho   are  operating  the  companies  consider  this   an\r\n\r\nimposition, and they feel that it encourages a short-term\r\n\r\napproach and they are strongly against it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to strike a balance between the two, and not\r\n\r\nmake the obligations of listing on our Stock Exchange  so\r\n\r\nonerous  that  companies, especially  foreign  ones,  are\r\n\r\ndiscouraged from listing here.  To solve this problem, we\r\n\r\nhave a corporate governance committee which Mr Joe Pillay\r\n\r\nchairs,  and comprising practitioners from the  industry.\r\n\r\nThey  discussed it extensively.  There was  no  unanimity\r\n\r\nbut   they   discussed  it.   All   views   were   aired.\r\n\r\nEventually,  a majority recommended that we proceed  with\r\n\r\nquarterly  reporting,  and we have  done  so,  with  some\r\n\r\nphasing-in period for the smaller companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that not every Exchange takes this\r\n\r\napproach.  Hong Kong has not done this.  I think  Britain\r\n\r\nhas   not  done  this  either,  but  the  American  stock\r\n\r\nexchanges  have  done this.  So it is an arguable  issue,\r\n\r\nwhether  or not it is something which we ought to follow.\r\n\r\nWe have taken the advice, because we have a committee and\r\n\r\nthey  are knowledgeable people. We will leave it for  now\r\n\r\nand  after a few years, if it is not a workable  approach\r\n\r\nor the consensus of professional opinion changes, then we\r\n\r\nwill look at it again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for forecast and expert opinion, this is similar\r\n\r\nto  the  question of quarterly reporting.  It is again  a\r\n\r\ntrade-off  between  having a set of corporate  governance\r\n\r\nrules  which  looks  good  on  paper  and  one  which  is\r\n\r\npractical  and implementable.  And if it is  not  working\r\n\r\nout,  we  will have to reconsider the matter.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nfamiliar\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  this  particular issue, but it is arguable  whether\r\n\r\nyou  want  to have a forecast which is backed  by  expert\r\n\r\nopinion, in which case you are just paying the expert  to\r\n\r\nsign  his name, or whether you want to allow somebody  to\r\n\r\nput  out a forecast and say, \"Well, that's my view but  I\r\n\r\ntake no great responsibility for it.\"  In which case,  it\r\n\r\nwould carry less weight, and may mislead some people  who\r\n\r\nread  the  prospectus and who do not understand  what  it\r\n\r\nmeans.   But these are trade-offs which we will  have  to\r\n\r\nweigh  and  which we will have to consult the  practising\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for companies from India and China having\r\n\r\ndifficulty with best practices from the West, I can  well\r\n\r\nimagine  this is so.  The issue is: what then  should  we\r\n\r\ndo?  I think we should have a set of best practices which\r\n\r\nmakes  sense for us, and which assures us that  what  the\r\n\r\ncompanies   are   doing  are  adequately  disclosed   and\r\n\r\nmaintains  a  certain  tone and  standard  on  our  stock\r\n\r\nmarket.   So  companies which are there, everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat  they meet a certain standard.  We cannot  say  that\r\n\r\njust  because companies in the region generally have much\r\n\r\nlower  standards, therefore we should lower our standards\r\n\r\nso that all of them can list in Singapore. We will become\r\n\r\na casino and we will have no idea what will happen.  Even\r\n\r\nif  a  company  declares its accounts  and  goes  by  the\r\n\r\ndisclosure and the auditing standards, nobody knows  what\r\n\r\ndo the figures mean.  So that is not desirable. We need a\r\n\r\nset of realistic, respectable standards, and if there are\r\n\r\ncompanies which we want to have listed here, which cannot\r\n\r\nquite  meet those standards but have the potential,  then\r\n\r\nwe should encourage and help those companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Sin pointed out quite rightly, we have to do\r\n\r\nmore  to  attract these companies to come  to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nChina  and  India are very natural potential markets  for\r\n\r\nus,  and  we  ought to do more.  In fact,  SGX  has  been\r\n\r\nmaking  frequent  trips to countries  in  the  region  to\r\n\r\npromote the opportunities and the prospects of listing in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I think they need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  more  and  they need to put their value  propositions\r\n\r\nmore  cogently  to  them.   The  value  proposition   for\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  list here would be:  firstly,  to  raise\r\n\r\ntheir profile in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they would not be overshadowed by bigger\r\n\r\ncompanies or more sexy and glamorous companies,  as  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  in  Nasdaq  or the New  York  Stock  Exchange.\r\n\r\nAlthough  they  are small, they can come here,  build  up\r\n\r\ntheir  operations and their profile.  And  later  on,  if\r\n\r\nthey want to go somewhere else to list, they can still do\r\n\r\nthat.   But  if they go to Nasdaq, as many companies  did\r\n\r\nduring the dot.com era, they become \"orphaned\".  It is  a\r\n\r\ntechnical term.  What it means is that after a while, the\r\n\r\nanalysts  lose  interest in you.  They do not  write  any\r\n\r\nreports on you, and nobody trades in you because there is\r\n\r\nno information on you. So you have got a dead stock.  But\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, on a smaller Exchange, that is less likely\r\n\r\nto  happen.   And because we are in Asia, we are  in  the\r\n\r\nsame time zone and information flow is readily available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Singapore offers an environment where\r\n\r\ninvestors  can  have confidence, because  we  have  sound\r\n\r\ncorporate   governance  and  regulatory   standards   and\r\n\r\nefficient   and   transparent   processing   of   listing\r\n\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stock Exchange has to promote these value\r\n\r\npropositions.   We  have  also  made  efforts  to   raise\r\n\r\nfamiliarity with global investors, and to deal  with  the\r\n\r\nsupervisors  as  well.  We have good relations  with  the\r\n\r\nsupervisors.   This  gives comfort to companies  to  come\r\n\r\nhere, and for their supervisors to give the nod for their\r\n\r\ncompanies to come here. MAS has signed MOUs with  Chinese\r\n\r\nfinancial  regulators  and the Chinese  Central  Bank  to\r\n\r\nenhance  our  cooperation.  We have had  staff  exchanges\r\n\r\nwith  them  to  foster  interaction and  promote  greater\r\n\r\nappreciation  of each other's financial sectors,  and  we\r\n\r\nwill  continue to engage the regulators in the  different\r\n\r\ncountries,  build  rapport, hold  regular  dialogues  and\r\n\r\nfacilitate training opportunities with them.  We  have  a\r\n\r\nregular flow of officers coming from the People's Bank of\r\n\r\nChina to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAS  for training and gaining exposure. We are very happy\r\n\r\nwith this.  We welcome this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Stock Exchange has about 122\r\n\r\ncompanies  which are of foreign origin.  This is  20%  of\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  companies on the Stock  Exchange.   They\r\n\r\naccount  for 41% of the total market capitalisation.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  we  have  attracted,  so  far,  19   Chinese\r\n\r\ncompanies  to list on SGX.  So there has been  reasonable\r\n\r\nsuccess, although we probably need to do still more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, my topic is on the financing\r\n\r\nof  SMEs.   I have a keen interest and have been involved\r\n\r\nin  the study of financing environment for start-ups  and\r\n\r\nfor  SMEs in Singapore.  The main conclusion is  that  we\r\n\r\nhave   gaps  in  the  type  of  financing  available   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   compared   to  the   other   entrepreneurial\r\n\r\neconomies around the world.  I will raise most  of  these\r\n\r\nissues and gaps during the Committee of Supply debate  on\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Trade and Industry.  There are, however,\r\n\r\ntwo  issues which I think the Ministry of Finance  should\r\n\r\naddress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is want of a small business bank.\r\n\r\nI  am not suggesting that we set up another DBS or a  new\r\n\r\nsmall  bank in Singapore.  But what we need is a bank  or\r\n\r\nbanks  able  to  support  and finance  small  and  medium\r\n\r\ncompanies.  After so many rounds of dialogue sessions and\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with the business community, I am  convinced\r\n\r\nthat  we have a structural gap in this area, and it needs\r\n\r\nto be plugged fast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of successful models are the Wells Fargo\r\n\r\nBank in the USA, which is a very big bank but it supports\r\n\r\nsmall companies, or SME Loan which is a very small entity\r\n\r\nand  has  also  successfully supported  small  companies.\r\n\r\nWhat  do they have in common?  First of all, they have  a\r\n\r\nscheme  which assesses companies differently compared  to\r\n\r\nassessing  bigger companies.  They have a good method  of\r\n\r\nmonitoring  performance  of these  companies.   So,  this\r\n\r\ngives   them  comfort  to  loan  money  to  the   smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies.  And they have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  much  more  hands-on approach in  understanding  SMEs'\r\n\r\nneeds.   While we can transform one of our banks, whether\r\n\r\nlocal  or  foreign,  to do all of these,  we  could  also\r\n\r\nattract the likes of Wells Fargo to come to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create the likes of SME Loan or small entities,\r\n\r\nwe  will  need some legislation changes to perhaps  allow\r\n\r\nsome  of our existing finance companies which are already\r\n\r\nhere  in  Singapore to play the role  or  to  extend  the\r\n\r\nmoneylender licence to allow entities like SME Loan to be\r\n\r\nset up, which was set up on that basis also in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation has to allow flexibility to banks or the\r\n\r\nfinance companies to charge higher interest by virtue  of\r\n\r\nthe higher risks of such loans, and to allow them to have\r\n\r\nsome  facilities which are now only restricted  to  banks\r\n\r\nbut  not to the finance companies.  This will allow  them\r\n\r\nto  help  SMEs  by providing more comprehensive  services\r\n\r\nwhich do not exist today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one is of an emerging market board or OTC\r\n\r\nwhere  easy listings and easy trading of shares can  take\r\n\r\nplace.   In Taiwan, there is what we call a \"grey market\"\r\n\r\nor  a pre-listing market, and I had the opportunity to do\r\n\r\na  study trip to Taiwan to understand how this works.  It\r\n\r\nworks  so  well that the Security Exchange of Taiwan  has\r\n\r\nset  up  a parallel one that runs in the private  sector.\r\n\r\nWhat  this does is that it allows liquidity and  cash  to\r\n\r\nflow   into  further  investments,  and  it  also   gives\r\n\r\nconfidence  to  investors that they can  exit  sooner  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need.  Companies can basically trade  their\r\n\r\nshares the day the company is formed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this successfully, we need a couple of\r\n\r\nelements.  First of all, it needs to be a very simple set-up,  not  like another Sesdaq.  It needs to be  regulated\r\n\r\nwith  a  light  touch.   It must  cost  very  little  for\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  use  this avenue to raise  funds  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we must have a good disclosure system.   I  have\r\n\r\nraised  this  issue for quite some time and the  Minister\r\n\r\nhad  in  the  past indicated his willingness to  look  at\r\n\r\nthis, and I think this is the best time to press on  with\r\n\r\nthe implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, many of my colleagues,\r\n\r\nincluding   Mr  Inderjit  Singh  who  just  spoke,   have\r\n\r\nrecounted  the  woes  of  SMEs  when  trying  to   secure\r\n\r\nfinancing  for  their businesses.   In  a  nutshell,  the\r\n\r\nfactors against SMEs are largely those of size and a lack\r\n\r\nof  track record.  Any banker will tell you that he would\r\n\r\nlove   to   help,  but  risk  ranks  paramount   in   his\r\n\r\nconsideration  of extension of credit.  But,  as  we  all\r\n\r\nknow, all the successful businesses today must have  been\r\n\r\nsmall  and without a track record once when they started.\r\n\r\nSome   banker  or  governmental  help  must   have   been\r\n\r\ninstrumental in nurturing these entrepreneurial efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am raising this challenge again as I envisage\r\n\r\neven  greater  obstacles to financing for SMEs  with  the\r\n\r\nbanks  moving  towards  a  risk  based  capital  adequacy\r\n\r\nregime.   From  what  I  understand,  risk  weights   are\r\n\r\nattached to the customers according to some assessment of\r\n\r\ncredit  worthiness of either the customer himself or  the\r\n\r\nbusiness.   In other words, a clear distinction  will  be\r\n\r\nmade between customer type, perhaps with greater emphasis\r\n\r\nthan  is  done  currently.  So, the more  banks  lend  to\r\n\r\nriskier  customers, the more capital backing  they  would\r\n\r\nneed,  and  this  goes against the grain of  pressurising\r\n\r\nbanks to optimise their capital efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the larger companies who have established track\r\n\r\nrecords  and cash-flows to support the ability to service\r\n\r\nthe loans, their risk weights will be pegged accordingly.\r\n\r\nFor  the  smaller  companies or start-ups,  greater  risk\r\n\r\nweights are likely to be attached, thus placing them at a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the anticipated increased difficulty\r\n\r\nthat  SMEs  will encounter with the risk-based  framework\r\n\r\nfor  banks,  how will the Government help  mitigate  this\r\n\r\nchallenge?  Will the Government assume a bigger share  of\r\n\r\nthe  exposure  from  loans  to  SMEs  and  start-ups,  in\r\n\r\naddition to the various suggestions made by my colleague,\r\n\r\nMr Inderjit Singh?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, like the\r\n\r\nprevious  speakers, I would like to touch on the problems\r\n\r\nfaced  by SMEs in obtaining loans for growth.  Our  banks\r\n\r\nare  usually too risk-averse.  And when they do not  know\r\n\r\nthe SME or its business, they are reluctant to lend money\r\n\r\nto the SME.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The micro loan under the Small Industries Financing\r\n\r\nScheme (SIFS) set up by the Government does resolve  this\r\n\r\nproblem  to  a certain extent.  However, the  micro  loan\r\n\r\nonly  offers  a  small  amount of money  to  the  company\r\n\r\napplying  for a loan.  I would therefore like to  suggest\r\n\r\nanother possible way for SMEs to obtain loans for growth.\r\n\r\nIn  China,  there  are  commercial  funds  set  up  which\r\n\r\nguarantee the loans made by banks to companies in  return\r\n\r\nfor  a  fee or other benefits by stock options.  Usually,\r\n\r\nthese  funds are more familiar with the business of these\r\n\r\ncompanies.   So, they are more willing to  undertake  the\r\n\r\nrisk  that banks avoid.  The amount of loans these  funds\r\n\r\nare  licensed to guarantee can be up to seven times their\r\n\r\ncapital.   If  allowed in Singapore, they can  complement\r\n\r\nthe  SIFS,  as  well as the Venture and Angel  Funds,  in\r\n\r\nfinancing our Singaporean entrepreneurs.  If there  is  a\r\n\r\ndemand for such a scheme, would MAS consider allowing  it\r\n\r\nto operate in Singapore?  May I have the Minister's reply\r\n\r\non this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Penny Low, you can take both\r\n\r\ncuts at one go.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, according to the latest\r\n\r\nestimates   by   the  Department  of  Statistics,   total\r\n\r\nhousehold  liabilities,  in the  form  of  mortgages  and\r\n\r\npersonal  loans,  grown  from  118%  of  annual  personal\r\n\r\ndisposable income in 1995 to 174% in year 2001.  In other\r\n\r\nwords, more future money is being spent today.  Our ratio\r\n\r\nof  household  debt  is  higher than  that  in  the  OECD\r\n\r\neconomies, such as the United Kingdom, United States  and\r\n\r\nJapan.   Simultaneously,  bankruptcies  have  also  grown\r\n\r\nrapidly.  Figures from the Public Trustee show the number\r\n\r\nof  bankruptcies in Singapore to be 2,710 in  year  2000;\r\n\r\n3,237 in year 2001;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  3,588 in year 2002.  It is an increasing trend,  and\r\n\r\nabout  300  people are made bankrupt each month  for  the\r\n\r\nyear 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise in bankruptcies and the rapid growth of\r\n\r\nconsumer credits are signs of, on one hand, a consumption\r\n\r\nculture  and,  on  the  other hand, the  availability  of\r\n\r\nsecured and unsecured loans.  I would elaborate a bit  on\r\n\r\nthe loans part in my latter part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of consumer financial literacy,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  an  affluent society, despite  the  recent\r\n\r\ndownturns.  After years of boom and steady growth, it has\r\n\r\ntaught  us to earn money, but not manage money.   A  best\r\n\r\nselling  book  in  the  US  \"The Millionaire  Next  Door\"\r\n\r\nexpounds certain virtues of wealth management and  wealth\r\n\r\naccumulation; two of which would be, one, frugality; two,\r\n\r\nlowering  your  investment and taking  responsibility  in\r\n\r\nyour   own  wealth  building.   But  as  shown   by   the\r\n\r\nstatistics,  we  have  obviously not  learnt  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nInstead of building wealth, we are depleting wealth  very\r\n\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fast aging society, with falling fertility\r\n\r\nrates,  it  would  impose a very  great  strain  on  both\r\n\r\npersonal  and  State  funds to  grant  retirement.   Past\r\n\r\nefforts at liberalising the CPF scheme, encouraging self-investment, hit a very rough patch, not just  because  of\r\n\r\nthe  downturn,  but because of the lack of  understanding\r\n\r\nand  knowledge.   In other words, there  is  a  very  low\r\n\r\nfinancial literacy rate in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial management, or planning, differs from that\r\n\r\nof  investment  planning.  The former is about  financial\r\n\r\nlife cycle planning and goals planning which look at both\r\n\r\nshort-term  and  long-term goals.  The latter,  which  is\r\n\r\ninvestment planning, is about making money in  the  short\r\n\r\nterm.   Most  people confuse the two and  focus  more  on\r\n\r\nmaking  the money for the short term when they move  into\r\n\r\nany  investment  instrument.   When  consumers  are  more\r\n\r\naware,  they  can ask relevant questions,  make  informed\r\n\r\ndecisions  and place responsibilities for their  actions,\r\n\r\nrather  than play the blame game of finger-pointing  when\r\n\r\nthings  go wrong.  When the milk is spilt, there is  very\r\n\r\nlittle that anyone can do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, if consumer literacy could be focused on,\r\n\r\nthen  I  believe  that market forces are such  that  when\r\n\r\nconsumer  literacy, or financial quotient (FQ), goes  up,\r\n\r\nthe professional standards would also have to go up.  All\r\n\r\nthe financial professionals would have to work themselves\r\n\r\nout  of  the  job.  Therefore, I hope that  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwould consider promoting FQ as a win-win strategy for all\r\n\r\nand work on it should start as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I move on to the cut on loans. With Singapore\r\n\r\npushing  towards becoming a world-class financial centre,\r\n\r\nit allows me to note that many consumers are not aware of\r\n\r\nthe terms and conditions surrounding consumer credits and\r\n\r\nloan  instruments.  There are two main reasons for  this.\r\n\r\nOne,   the   use   of   technical  jargons   by   lending\r\n\r\ninstitutions; and two, the lack of disclosure.  There are\r\n\r\na  myriad  of  terms  used  by financial  institutions  - revolving  credit,  floating terms,  fixed,  compounding,\r\n\r\nballoon payment, variable terms, interest chargeable  are\r\n\r\nalso divided into monthly rest, yearly rest, and the list\r\n\r\ngoes  on.    Most consumers are ignorant of these  terms,\r\n\r\nand  therefore may not fully understand the  implications\r\n\r\nof the terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a sophisticated financial centre, fianancial\r\n\r\ninstitutions   should   have  the   best   practices   in\r\n\r\ndisclosure,  not  just for investment products,  but  any\r\n\r\nproduct  that  would impact the personal finances  of  an\r\n\r\nindividual.   Consumers should have the full  benefit  of\r\n\r\ndisclosure on any type of financial products marketed  by\r\n\r\nthe  financial institutions, be it credit, investment  or\r\n\r\nprotection  products,  so that he  or  she  can  make  an\r\n\r\ninformed decision.  The lack of such knowledge can  wreak\r\n\r\nhavoc  on  one's  finances  leading  to  financial   dire\r\n\r\nstraits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like to ask the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nthe  following: one, the financial institutions marketing\r\n\r\ncredit  loan products to fully disclose to the  consumers\r\n\r\nthe impact of interest payments relative to the principal\r\n\r\namount borrowed or consumed.  This can be done through an\r\n\r\namortisation schedule, with separate columns illustrating\r\n\r\nprincipal   payment,  interest  payment  and  outstanding\r\n\r\npayment.  A similar example would be that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   the  life  insurance  quotation  which  a  financial\r\n\r\ninstitution  is  compelled to present to  the  consumers.\r\n\r\nTwo, that the financial institution demonstrates that  an\r\n\r\nexplanation  has  been  made  to  the  consumer  on   the\r\n\r\nimplication  of  the loan, or credit, with  the  consumer\r\n\r\nduly acknowledging that he or she has been advised by way\r\n\r\nof signing on the compliance document.  It could be, say,\r\n\r\njust at the bottom of the amortisation schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, three, lending and consumer credit activities\r\n\r\nbe  included under the regime of the FAA notice,  No.  3,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  notice on information to clients  and  product\r\n\r\ninformation  disclosure as some financial  advisers  also\r\n\r\ncarry credit products and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Budget, the intention to grow  the  service\r\n\r\nsector as the twin engine of growth has been given  great\r\n\r\nimportance.    Financial  services   are   an   important\r\n\r\ncomponent of the overall service industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is today a major international\r\n\r\nfinancial centre.  Over the years, we have attracted many\r\n\r\nreputable international financial institutions to set  up\r\n\r\noperations  in Singapore.  We were able to  attract  them\r\n\r\nbecause of our sound economic and financial fundamentals.\r\n\r\nWe  have  been  ranked by agencies,  such  as  the  World\r\n\r\nEconomic Forum, Global Competitive Needs Report, as among\r\n\r\nthe  top  most  sophisticated financial  markets  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   All  these have translated into high  value  and\r\n\r\ngood paying jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to further illustrate this point, the financial\r\n\r\nservices industry accounts for 11.6% of Singapore's total\r\n\r\nGDP  in year 2001, compared to 1978 when its share of GDP\r\n\r\nwas  5%.   As  for employment, each share has risen  from\r\n\r\n2.7%  in  1978 to 4.6% in year 2001.  We have made  sound\r\n\r\nachievements and we have the potential to go  further  in\r\n\r\nthe area of economic growth and, more importantly, in the\r\n\r\narea of employment creation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported in the media recently that some US\r\n\r\nwebsites  have advised online merchants to stop accepting\r\n\r\nall  Singapore  issued credit cards.  In fact,  Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  put  on the blacklist of countries prone  to  online\r\n\r\nfraud.   I  also read of a case where a man was sentenced\r\n\r\nin  court  on  28th February this year for using  a  fake\r\n\r\ncredit  card.   When I read those reports, the  immediate\r\n\r\nthing  that came to my mind was that we must not allow  a\r\n\r\nfew unscrupulous individuals to delay our efforts to turn\r\n\r\nSingapore into a global financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I would like to ask the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  the following:  to what extent is  credit  card\r\n\r\nfraud  prevalent in Singapore?  What are the steps  taken\r\n\r\nby his Ministry to eradicate or minimise such credit card\r\n\r\nfraud?   Are the security features of credit cards issued\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  adequate?   More  importantly,  will  the\r\n\r\nproblem of credit card fraud undermine Singapore's  sound\r\n\r\nreputation  and  set  us  back in growing  our  financial\r\n\r\nservices  industry?  Although credit  card  is  only  one\r\n\r\nsmall  part  of  consumer banking in the broad  range  of\r\n\r\nfinancial services we provide, we must nonetheless  stamp\r\n\r\nout  such  problems  before  they  take  root  and  cause\r\n\r\npermanent damage to our reputation as a stable, safe  and\r\n\r\ncredible international financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, as my fellow MP\r\n\r\nnoted,  personal bankruptcies are on the rise.   When  my\r\n\r\nconstituents came to see me, I noticed that some of  them\r\n\r\nwere in financial troubles because they had over extended\r\n\r\nthemselves  with  renovation loans  and  other  forms  of\r\n\r\nconsumer   credit.    I  am  worried   about   the   easy\r\n\r\navailability of consumer credit and how these people have\r\n\r\ngot into trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that there are credit bureaus that will\r\n\r\nprotect  our banks.  However, what can we do  to  protect\r\n\r\nthe  consumers?  Perhaps, there might be a mandatory two-week cooling-off period before disbursement of loans  for\r\n\r\ncertain  types  of  consumer credit, such  as  renovation\r\n\r\nloans.  Perhaps, the cooling-off period might be used for\r\n\r\npeople to undergo\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmandatory  credit  counselling  and  give  them  time  to\r\n\r\nretract any unwise decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What comes under the ambit of these programmes could\r\n\r\nbe  taken  up  by CASE or the Ministry of  Finance.   But\r\n\r\nperhaps  these services might even include help with  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring of consumer credit for those who come  into\r\n\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, I speak in favour of\r\n\r\nestablishing a consumer debt counselling agency.  In  our\r\n\r\ndrive  to  promote entrepreneurship, we can  expect  some\r\n\r\nwould  succeed  and some would fail.  We must  create  an\r\n\r\nenvironment where those who fail can come back  to  fight\r\n\r\nanother day.  A staggering $124 million in credit charges\r\n\r\nwere not repaid last year forcing banks to write off  the\r\n\r\nentire amount.  And with $2.4 billion of roll-over  debts\r\n\r\nstill  outstanding  at  the end of  last  year,  industry\r\n\r\nplayers say the chances of further debt defaults are even\r\n\r\ngreater.   This is indeed high and worrisome, because  it\r\n\r\ndemonstrates a lack of financial discipline and prudence.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability for consumers to repay personal loans\r\n\r\nand  credit  card  advances in these times  is  of  great\r\n\r\nconcern.   We  know that, in most cases,  such  loans  or\r\n\r\nadvances   are  unsecured  and  are  aimed  at  financing\r\n\r\nconsumption.   To  mitigate the risk,  they  charge  high\r\n\r\ninterest  rates.  With the establishment of  the  Central\r\n\r\nCredit  Bureau, these recalcitrant borrowers' ability  to\r\n\r\ndo  more  damage is curtailed.  However, in the past  few\r\n\r\nyears,  many budding entrepreneurs in the SME sector  may\r\n\r\nhave resorted to personal loans to tide over the economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.   However, the economic climate turned  from  a\r\n\r\nrainy  day to a rainy season.  This was the beginning  of\r\n\r\nthe problem for businessmen who resorted to high interest\r\n\r\nloans  and  credit cards to finance their business.   The\r\n\r\neconomic downturn has turned some of the human capital in\r\n\r\nthis  group  that  we need into helpless  victims.   Many\r\n\r\nindividuals  found  themselves facing  debts  when  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses failed.  Lending institutions try to recover\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  loans  as much as possible, and quite  rightly  so\r\n\r\ntoo.  In my opinion, this does not solve the problem, but\r\n\r\nrather  create  an impossible situation  for  individuals\r\n\r\nburdened by debt in the first place.  If the debtor  does\r\n\r\nnot  pay off any of the banks, he is made a bankrupt,  in\r\n\r\nwhich case, it is a no-win situation for all concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Sir, it would send a very negative\r\n\r\nsignal to all budding entrepreneurs, that you try at your\r\n\r\nown  peril.   Can we find a solution that satisfies  both\r\n\r\nparties?   In my humble opinion, we can.  I am suggesting\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of Finance could take the lead and  set\r\n\r\nup  a  mediator agency between the good debtors and their\r\n\r\nlenders, the consumer debt counselling agency.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  important  for budding  entrepreneurs.   Some\r\n\r\nfailed  and  found lower paying jobs.  Others lost  their\r\n\r\njobs or businesses.  These individuals have learnt a hard\r\n\r\nlesson.  Let us not stifle their good intentions to build\r\n\r\na  better  life  for  themselves and  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state in clear terms that I do not advocate\r\n\r\nbailing out consumers' burden by debt.  I propose we look\r\n\r\nat   ways   in  which  we  can  help  individuals   avoid\r\n\r\nbankruptcy.  Bankruptcy would be equal to a death warrant\r\n\r\nfor  the  entrepreneur.  No bank would  extend  loans  or\r\n\r\nfacilities to him.  He cannot be a director of a company.\r\n\r\nWe  should allow such good debtors another chance to  get\r\n\r\nback  in their life, and the formation of a consumer debt\r\n\r\ncounselling agency would allow that by mediating on their\r\n\r\nbehalf with the lending agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, first, let me address the\r\n\r\nissue of financing for SMEs and other growing businesses.\r\n\r\nAs  Members  realise, this is a multi-faceted  challenge.\r\n\r\nWe have many agencies involved in providing the financing\r\n\r\nfor the different stages of growth of a company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we have the banks. Of course,\r\n\r\nbanks do see SMEs as a good business to go in.  They  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  prepared to take as much risk as other agencies,\r\n\r\nbut banks do play a role.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have finance companies, and they are subject\r\n\r\nto the prudential limit on unsecured lending of $5,000 to\r\n\r\nany   single  customer  and  10%  of  capital  funds   in\r\n\r\naggregate.   These  rules are necessary  because  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies do take deposits and we do need to protect  the\r\n\r\ndepositors.  But,  at the same time, in  line  with  MAS'\r\n\r\nshift  to  a  risk-based supervisory  approach,  we  have\r\n\r\nallowed  better-managed finance companies to  be  granted\r\n\r\nexemptions  to  this  limit.   Hong  Leong  Finance,  for\r\n\r\nexample, is allowed to extend unsecured loans up to  0.5%\r\n\r\nof its capital funds to a single customer, and 10% of the\r\n\r\ncapital  funds  in  aggregate.  So, well-managed  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  can play this role in providing  financing  to\r\n\r\nSMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested attracting companies,\r\n\r\nsuch  as Wells Fargo or SME Loan.  Basically, the MAS  is\r\n\r\nopen   to   admitting  banks  or  other   entities   with\r\n\r\nspecialised expertise in SME financing, so long  as  they\r\n\r\nmeet  our prudential standards for licensing.  So,  there\r\n\r\nare  no rules which bar entities like Wells Fargo or  SME\r\n\r\nLoan to come to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested that we encourage\r\n\r\nan  over-the-counter (OTC) market.  He described the grey\r\n\r\nmarket in Taiwan and how it has facilitated the growth of\r\n\r\ncompanies.   The  Corporate  Finance  Committee  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore also suggested a similar arrangement, something\r\n\r\nalong  the lines of an Internet-based bulletin board,  to\r\n\r\nbring  together start-ups and venture-type companies  and\r\n\r\nsophisticated   investors  who  may  be   interested   in\r\n\r\ninvesting  in  such  companies.   Today,  there  are   no\r\n\r\nregulatory  impediments  to  the  OTC  trading   of   any\r\n\r\nsecurities,  including shares of SMEs.  Indeed,  SGX  and\r\n\r\nothers have reviewed the possibility of setting up an OTC\r\n\r\nmarket  along  the lines described by Mr Inderjit  Singh.\r\n\r\nThey  think that such a set-up is not commercially viable\r\n\r\nat  the moment.  But I think they will still continue  to\r\n\r\nreview this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS, in its recent amendments to the Securities\r\n\r\nand Futures Act two\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  allows  it  to recognise  different  trading\r\n\r\nsystems   for  the  buying  and  selling  of  securities,\r\n\r\nincluding  private equities.  Basically, the  legislation\r\n\r\nhas  been  amended  to  allow  us  access  to  all  these\r\n\r\npossibilities.   We are depending on the  market  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether these are viable, and to throw up solutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, on its part, of course, as you all\r\n\r\nknow,  has a full range of assistance programmes for  the\r\n\r\nSMEs,  whether  it  is LEFS, LETAS, Micro  Loans  or  the\r\n\r\nvarious  programmes.   Dr  John Chen  suggested  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  allow  companies  which  wish  to  provide   loan\r\n\r\nguarantees to be set up here.  Again, there are no  rules\r\n\r\nagainst  this.   MAS' approval is not required  for  such\r\n\r\nentities to be set up, and we will have to depend on  the\r\n\r\nmarket to decide whether this is commercially viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua raised the issue of the New Basle\r\n\r\nCapital  Accord, and whether the risk weighting vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nthe smaller companies may act against the availability of\r\n\r\nfinancing  for  such companies.  As Mrs  Lim  knows,  the\r\n\r\nBasle  accord  is not likely to be implemented  until  at\r\n\r\nleast  2006.   MAS and the various agencies  are  closely\r\n\r\nmonitoring the rules, as these are being discussed.   The\r\n\r\nimpact  on  our SMEs' lending will really depend  on  the\r\n\r\ndetails  of these rules - as Mrs Lim said, how the  Basle\r\n\r\naccord sets the weightage on the various risks.  We  will\r\n\r\nmonitor  this  impact, and if these new capital  adequacy\r\n\r\nrules  should  drastically affect the banks'  ability  to\r\n\r\nlend  to  the SMEs, then of course we will have  to  work\r\n\r\nwith  the  banks to see how they can address this  issue.\r\n\r\nWe  all  realise  that  if  we want  to  grow  the  SMEs,\r\n\r\nfinancing is a critical challenge, and I am sure that  Mr\r\n\r\nRaymond Lim, working together with MTI and MOF, should be\r\n\r\nable to address this issue, and we will have a full range\r\n\r\nof avenues available to our SMEs to grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low raised the topic about consumer\r\n\r\nfinancial  literacy.  This is of course a very  important\r\n\r\nissue,  if  we want to encourage Singaporeans  to  manage\r\n\r\ntheir financial resources, particularly for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir retirement needs.  But let me just address some  of\r\n\r\nthe points which she raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the higher percentage of household debt\r\n\r\ncompared  to personal disposable income.  This is  partly\r\n\r\nbecause the percentage of home ownership in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nmuch  higher  than  in other OECD countries.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthese  properties being mortgaged will be flagged on  the\r\n\r\nliabilities  side  and  we get a  higher  household  debt\r\n\r\ncompared  to  personal disposable income.   But  we  have\r\n\r\nlooked  at  the  household debt, and it is not  something\r\n\r\nthat  causes us concern.  Because of our high  percentage\r\n\r\nof home ownership, we have a higher liability but, on the\r\n\r\nassets  side, despite the downturn in the housing prices,\r\n\r\nthe assets of households are still growing decently.  So,\r\n\r\non balance, we are still managing reasonably well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher rate of bankruptcies, I suppose, is also\r\n\r\na  function of the economic cycle.  Whenever  we  have  a\r\n\r\ndownturn,   one   should  expect   a   higher   rate   of\r\n\r\nbankruptcies.   But, notwithstanding  all  that  we  have\r\n\r\nsaid, I think we agree that consumer financial literacy - or  what  Miss  Penny Low described as FQ - is  something\r\n\r\nthat is very important.  We want Singaporeans to save  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  wealth, and to manage this properly for  their\r\n\r\nretirement needs.  To this end, it should not be just the\r\n\r\nrole  of  the Government.  The Government will work  with\r\n\r\nother  agencies, both in the private sector  as  well  as\r\n\r\nNGOs, to try and improve the basic financial know-how  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Investor education is  a  very  important\r\n\r\nchallenge,  and Deputy Prime Minister Lee mentioned  just\r\n\r\nnow  that, in the UK, the FSA is very deeply involved  in\r\n\r\nmaking   sure   that  consumer  protection   issues   are\r\n\r\nadequately addressed.  Similarly, we need to strike  this\r\n\r\nbalance  in Singapore.  But this is definitely  something\r\n\r\nhigh on our agenda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low also raised the issue about the\r\n\r\ntechnical  jargon used in the loans and credit  business,\r\n\r\nthat  we  should have proper disclosures, so that  people\r\n\r\nknow  what  they  are borrowing.  This  is  also  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant issue.  To some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextent,  we  have  made some progress.   The  Government,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  Association of  Banks  in  Singapore\r\n\r\n(ABS),  has  tried  to bring in place  better  disclosure\r\n\r\npractices.   The ABS, for example, has taken  significant\r\n\r\nsteps  to  raise the standards of disclosure  within  the\r\n\r\nbanking  industry.  The ABS has codified a  set  of  best\r\n\r\npractice  standards for member banks to abide by  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  a  code  of consumer banking  practices,  which\r\n\r\nincludes requirements for banks to disclose, in clear and\r\n\r\nplain  language,  all interest rates, fees,  charges  and\r\n\r\npenalties associated with their loan products.  This code\r\n\r\nof  consumer banking practices also requires the banks to\r\n\r\nhighlight  important  terms and conditions  in  the  loan\r\n\r\ncontract,   including  charges  for  early  or  premature\r\n\r\ntermination of a loan facility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, ABS has prepared a booklet to advise\r\n\r\nconsumers  on  the  questions they should  consider  when\r\n\r\nchoosing between various loan facilities.  They have also\r\n\r\nprepared a template information sheet with details of the\r\n\r\ninformation   that   banks  should  disclose   to   their\r\n\r\ncustomers,  and  the  manner in  which  this  information\r\n\r\nshould  be  presented.  We encourage such initiatives  by\r\n\r\nthe  ABS,  and we will also encourage other providers  of\r\n\r\nconsumer  loans  to  take  such steps  to  enhance  their\r\n\r\ndisclosure  standards.  But I agree with Miss  Penny  Low\r\n\r\nthat more can be done.  ABS should not just encourage its\r\n\r\nmember  banks to abide by the standards in the code,  but\r\n\r\nensure  that this code is regularly reviewed to  keep  in\r\n\r\nline with best international practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Low has also suggested that loan providers make\r\n\r\nclear   the   amortisation  schedules   of   their   loan\r\n\r\nfacilities.   This is an area that ABS should  also  look\r\n\r\ninto.   ABS should also consider an industry-wide  method\r\n\r\nfor  computing annual effective interest rates,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe long list of technical jargons which Miss Low pointed\r\n\r\nout just now can be made comprehensible to the layman.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which Miss Low made about signing\r\n\r\non  the  compliance document is something which  the  ABS\r\n\r\nshould also consider.  Just as an aside, when we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  financial counselling in the hospitals, we make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  everybody signs to indicate that he has understood.\r\n\r\nBut  then  it will come back to us.  Later on, they  say,\r\n\r\n\"We  signed,  but we still did not understand.\"   So,  we\r\n\r\nwill try, but I am not sure that is the final solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third point whether lending and credit\r\n\r\nactivities  should be included in the Financial  Advisers\r\n\r\nAct,  I  am  afraid  the scope of  the  FAA  only  covers\r\n\r\ninvestment  products and, therefore, consumer  loans  are\r\n\r\noutside the ambit of the FAA.  However, we do acknowledge\r\n\r\nthe   need   to  raise  disclosure  standards   to   meet\r\n\r\ninternational  best practices, and it is  important  that\r\n\r\nborrowers themselves take responsibility in understanding\r\n\r\nwhat  they are borrowing, and managing their finances  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that they can meet the obligations of the loans\r\n\r\nthat they are entering into.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Nithiah Nandan asked whether the recent report of\r\n\r\ncredit  card  fraud  may  set  back  the  growth  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  industry.  I would like to assure him  only  a\r\n\r\nminority  of on-line merchant overseas would  not  accept\r\n\r\nSingapore  issued credit cards.  Credit card issuers  and\r\n\r\noperators have clarified that Singapore issued cards  are\r\n\r\nstill  accepted  worldwide for the  majority  of  on-line\r\n\r\nmerchants.   The  few who do not accept Singapore  issued\r\n\r\ncards  have  done  so  based on their  internal  business\r\n\r\npractices  and  these are not clearly subscribed  by  the\r\n\r\nmajor on-line merchants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Nandan asked how many such frauds have taken\r\n\r\nplace.  There  were 29 reported cases of  on-line  credit\r\n\r\ncard  fraud in 2001.  So I think he would agree that this\r\n\r\nnumber  is  not very significant, compared to  the  large\r\n\r\nnumber of on-line transactions.  Notwithstanding that, we\r\n\r\ndo  realise  that credit card fraud is a growing  problem\r\n\r\nand   something  of  concern.   Together  with  the  card\r\n\r\nissuers, we will try our best to make sure that standards\r\n\r\nare   maintained  in  Singapore  and  that  the  security\r\n\r\nfeatures incorporated are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadequate  and based on the best practices.  I can  assure\r\n\r\nthe  Member that we would take steps to ensure that  this\r\n\r\ndoes not set back Singapore's goal as a financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Warren Lee and Mr Arthur Fong raised the\r\n\r\nissue  about  consumer credit, the need  for  counselling\r\n\r\nservices  and also mediation services.  This  must  be  a\r\n\r\njoint  effort.  On the part of MAS, under our guidelines,\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  may only  run  unsecured  credit\r\n\r\nfacilities  to individuals who have a minimum  income  of\r\n\r\n$30,000  per  year  and  the  maximum  credit  limit   is\r\n\r\nrestricted to two months' salary of the borrower.  So  we\r\n\r\ndo have some threshold or checks.  But, at the same time,\r\n\r\nwe  do  recognise  that there are  also  other  forms  of\r\n\r\navenues by which consumer credit can mount and which  may\r\n\r\ncause problems for the consumer.  In some countries, they\r\n\r\ndo have consumer credit counselling schemes but we do not\r\n\r\nknow   of  any  jurisdiction  that  has  mandated  credit\r\n\r\ncounselling  or a cooling-off period before the  consumer\r\n\r\nborrows, as Dr Warren Lee suggested.  Our view is, if  we\r\n\r\nmake it mandatory or insist on a cooling-off period, this\r\n\r\npractice may appear to be intrusive and burdensome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we do encourage consumers who face\r\n\r\nproblems to seek credit counselling.  The Association  of\r\n\r\nBanks  in  Singapore  and  the  Subordinate  Courts,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  are studying how best to encourage  counselling\r\n\r\nand  also how best to introduce mediation services.  This\r\n\r\nis  a problem that we do face and we are taking steps  to\r\n\r\naddress these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong, are you withdrawing your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, since we have time, can I\r\n\r\nmake a small query with the Deputy Prime Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I spoke earlier about the\r\n\r\nslow  payments  and  I  asked the Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether it would be useful for the Ministry of Finance to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissue a directive or reminder to Government agencies  and\r\n\r\nGLCs  to  make  prompt  payment  to  the  suppliers   and\r\n\r\ncontractors,  as this would help them in their  difficult\r\n\r\nfinancial  time now; especially when the slow payment  is\r\n\r\ndue  to some disagreement over a part of the contract but\r\n\r\nactually  the Government agency can assess the  value  of\r\n\r\nthe  part under dispute, and pay for the other parts that\r\n\r\nhave  been completed.  This would help the small SMEs  in\r\n\r\ntheir  cashflows.   I  have a case  in  my  MPS  where  a\r\n\r\ncontractor's  payments  were held  back  for  nearly  two\r\n\r\nyears,   because  of  some  disagreement  over  a  school\r\n\r\nbuilding  contract  and an army camp contract.   Payments\r\n\r\nwere not made because part of the completed work has  not\r\n\r\nbeen   agreed  upon.  Could  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider whether the Government can issue a directive  to\r\n\r\nall  its  agencies, and even to the GLCs, to make  prompt\r\n\r\npayments as far as possible?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, the Member may be glad to\r\n\r\nknow  that we have already reminded all agencies  to  pay\r\n\r\npromptly  and  to specify payment terms  clearly  in  all\r\n\r\nprocurement contracts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek companies and GLCs - these are on a\r\n\r\ncommercial basis - we do not get involved in their day-to-day   operations.    We   expect  the   Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies   to  be  fair  to  customers,  suppliers   and\r\n\r\ncompetitors,  and  this  includes  paying   their   debts\r\n\r\nproperly  and promptly according to the terms.  If  there\r\n\r\nare  grounds to believe that specific companies have  not\r\n\r\nbeen paying promptly and are unreasonable, then I hope he\r\n\r\nwould  give us specific details and feedback,  either  to\r\n\r\nthe  holding company, Temasek, or to MOF.  We would  look\r\n\r\ninto them and see what we can do.  But I would be careful\r\n\r\nto  say  that  in all cases where there are  delays,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agency  is the problem.   Disputes  are  very\r\n\r\ncomplicated.  I have come across some of them in my meet-the-people sessions and, I am sure, so have the  Members,\r\n\r\nand  they can go on for a very long time, and it  is  not\r\n\r\nalways  clear who is the cause of the dispute.  In  those\r\n\r\ncases,  we  have to understand that things would  take  a\r\n\r\nwhile to sort out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> I thank the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and Minister for Finance and the Second Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  for  all their replies.

Although the Minister had just said no, I\r\n\r\nwould like to appeal to the Minister to reconsider.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  does not have to give me an answer immediately.\r\n\r\nA \"yes\" answer later on would do just fine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not ask for the deposit to be reduced to\r\n\r\n$1,000,  but  to  its  former $5,000.   The  deposit  was\r\n\r\nincreased  to $10,000 at the beginning of this  month  on\r\n\r\nthe heels of news of the proliferation of gaming machines\r\n\r\non  premises of so-called \"football clubs\".  I understand\r\n\r\nthat the deposit is not to protect the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncollection of taxes on the takings of the machines.   The\r\n\r\ntakings and revenue from the jackpot machines are already\r\n\r\nunder strict control.  The machine can only be opened and\r\n\r\nthe  takings counted in the presence of IRAS officers and\r\n\r\nthe taxes duly levied and paid.  The deposits are thus to\r\n\r\ndeter  the  frivolous  request for such  machines.   IRAS\r\n\r\nshould,   therefore,  not  band  these  properly  behaved\r\n\r\norganisations with the so-called \"football clubs\".   IRAS\r\n\r\nhas allowed the machines to be used by members of the not-for-profit organisations for their own entertainment  and\r\n\r\nthe  surplus collected to be ploughed back to  serve  the\r\n\r\nmembers.   Increasing  the  deposit  would  require  more\r\n\r\nworking  capital  and  incur  unnecessary  cost  for  the\r\n\r\norganisations.  Sir, I would like to declare my  interest\r\n\r\nin  this  matter.   I am the advisor of  Nessea  Club,  a\r\n\r\ncommunity club in Nee Soon South.  It was set up and  run\r\n\r\nby  residents to serve themselves.  IRAS has  granted  it\r\n\r\nthe privilege of having jackpot machines on its premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former $5,000 deposit had been effective for the\r\n\r\npurpose  until  the  recent  proliferation  of  \"football\r\n\r\nclubs\".  I also understand that the authorities had taken\r\n\r\nactions  on these clubs.  There is thus no need to  raise\r\n\r\nthe  deposit.   If  IRAS is not prepared  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\ndeposit in general, can I request that this privilege  be\r\n\r\ngiven to organisations that have behaved themselves  and,\r\n\r\nif not for all machines, then for existing machines which\r\n\r\nalready enjoy the $5,000 deposit?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, as I said just now, the\r\n\r\n$5,000  deposit was put in place in 1967.

So, IRAS, in setting the new\r\n\r\ndeposit  at $10,000, is already under-pricing,  based  on\r\n\r\ninflation.  But I would not say \"no\" today.

It  may  be\r\n\r\nworthwhile  considering, perhaps, for our  colleagues  to\r\n\r\nexchange  our written submissions, so to speak,  so  that\r\n\r\nthere is less repetition amongst us, although it may  not\r\n\r\nbe  a bad thing to have repetition, because it is also an\r\n\r\nendorsement  of  that particular view by  more  than  one\r\n\r\nparliamentarian.   This could be  extended  even  to  the\r\n\r\nMinisters of State and to the Minister in charge of  that\r\n\r\nparticular  topic and vice-versa.  And that  might  go  a\r\n\r\nlong  way  towards parliamentary debate and the level  of\r\n\r\ndebate,   and   the   upgrading  of  our   standards   in\r\n\r\nparliamentary debates in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as reports on Parliament are concerned, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is important to disseminate whatever reports we  have\r\n\r\nto  the  public  at  large because  we  are  in  a  sense\r\n\r\naccountable to them.  No doubt, the Internet and  website\r\n\r\nwill go a long way to assist our citizenry to participate\r\n\r\nby listening to speeches and making assessments.  It is a\r\n\r\ngood  sign  to  see  many  members  of  the  public,  and\r\n\r\nespecially  the  young,  the school  children,  attending\r\n\r\nparliamentary  sessions  and  getting  an  idea  of  what\r\n\r\nParliament and parliamentary sessions are all about.   So\r\n\r\nI  would encourage Parliament itself to enhance the image\r\n\r\nof  Parliament  and  the reports  and  what  goes  on  in\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nrequest  that  the  current  recording  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\nsittings  be  webcast  live over the  Internet.   Current\r\n\r\ntechnologies  can  support such webcasting  at  very  low\r\n\r\ncost.   This will help our citizens and others interested\r\n\r\nto  follow  the proceedings without having to  come  down\r\n\r\npersonally  to  Parliament House to observe  the  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Strangers' Gallery above.   Let  me  say  that\r\n\r\nsitting  up  there  is  not  comfortable  and  not  time-productive.    Viewing   the  whole   proceedings,   from\r\n\r\ncommencement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  adjournment, over television is the best.  But it  is\r\n\r\nnot   cost  effective  and  thus  not  done,  except  for\r\n\r\nimportant  statements by the Ministers.  The  alternative\r\n\r\nis  to  use webcasting technology to show the proceedings\r\n\r\nover  the Internet.  This will encourage citizens to  log\r\n\r\non  to  the website and follow the arguments for a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of national debates and policy discussions.\r\n\r\nThis  will  bring about a more informed and knowledgeable\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, you can take the\r\n\r\nnext three cuts at one go.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> I am obliged, Sir. The\r\n\r\nissues are publicity and airing of parliamentary debates,\r\n\r\nstaff support for parliamentarians and welfare for staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards publicity and airing of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndebates, I would like to ask: is there a concerted effort\r\n\r\non  the  part of Parliament to improve the publicity  and\r\n\r\nairing  of these debates, (1) on TV; (2) radio; and,  (3)\r\n\r\nthe  mass media?  I remember a couple of years ago, there\r\n\r\nseemed  to  be  more  time allocated  on  television  for\r\n\r\nparliamentary debates.  It would appear that now it seems\r\n\r\nto  be much shorter, about 15-20 minutes or so, except on\r\n\r\nexceptional grounds.  I would urge Parliament to try  and\r\n\r\nliaise  with the mass media to try and enhance  the  time\r\n\r\nperiod  and  the concentration of parliamentary  debates,\r\n\r\nboth  Ministers and MPs' speeches, to be aired on TV  and\r\n\r\nradio,  and to try and liaise with the press  to  have  a\r\n\r\nsupplementary  page  whenever  Parliament   is   sitting,\r\n\r\nespecially during the time of the Budget debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for us to disseminate as much\r\n\r\ninformation   as  possible  and  arguments  and   counter\r\n\r\narguments for the citizenry to make an assessment and  to\r\n\r\ndecide,  so  that  they  also  would  improve  on   their\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of politics and issues that  concern  them\r\n\r\nand  the State.  And I think, overall, there will  be  an\r\n\r\nenhancement  of the educational process of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndebates and politics\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  So I cannot see but an improvement,  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  these things are seriously considered and steps taken\r\n\r\nto improve them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of staff support for parliamentarians,\r\n\r\nit  may  be  important to engage more professional  staff\r\n\r\nlike    lawyers,   accountants,   political   scientists,\r\n\r\neconomists,  sociologists,  etc,  to  help   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament in their research so that a higher standard is\r\n\r\nachieved  in  their parliamentary speeches,  preparation,\r\n\r\nstatistics, etc.  It may well be that MPs may  have  this\r\n\r\nkind of support but perhaps we could institutionalise the\r\n\r\nwhole  thing  and  have  the staff housed  in  Parliament\r\n\r\nthough the cost might go up, but this is one of the  most\r\n\r\nimportant institutions in Singapore, and what better  way\r\n\r\nthan getting enough expertise and people in the know,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  specialised fields, to help  parliamentarians\r\n\r\nin  the preparation of their research in order to prepare\r\n\r\ntheir respective speeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is just like in the Supreme Court where we\r\n\r\nhave  Justices  Law Clerks who are very high  performers,\r\n\r\nwho  have achieved very well in their law degrees in  NUS\r\n\r\nor in foreign universities, and these Justices Law Clerks\r\n\r\ndo assist the Judges in a great way in doing research, so\r\n\r\nthat  the  presentation by the Judges of their  judgments\r\n\r\nwould  be  of a higher standard too.  Similarly, perhaps,\r\n\r\nwe could look along the same line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of welfare for staff, Sir, I am sure there\r\n\r\nare  ways  and means of doing it and I am sure there  are\r\n\r\nmechanics that are in place right now.  But could I  just\r\n\r\nsay   that  I  hope  there  will  be  staff  welfare  and\r\n\r\nimprovement  in the upgrading of the staff  both  at  the\r\n\r\nsenior level and junior level too?  Perhaps we could send\r\n\r\nthem  on  scholarships  and also  for  local  studies  in\r\n\r\nTemasek  Polytechnic,  a  form  of  diploma  courses   in\r\n\r\nbusiness studies, law, banking, etc.  And I think in this\r\n\r\nway,  there  would  be  a  higher  morale  of  staff   in\r\n\r\nParliament and also upgrading of their standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  answer this on behalf of Parliament as Leader  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan asked what we have done about\r\n\r\nimproving   our   relations  with   other   parliamentary\r\n\r\norganisations  and also international  organisations.   I\r\n\r\nwould say that our Parliament has indeed been very active\r\n\r\nin  maintaining  warm  and friendly relations  with  many\r\n\r\ninternational  organisations and other Parliaments.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  we  are  an active participant  in  the  Inter-Parliamentary     Union,    Commonwealth    Parliamentary\r\n\r\nAssociation    and    the    ASEAN    Inter-Parliamentary\r\n\r\nOrganisation meetings.  From time to time, our MPs attend\r\n\r\nthe  conferences organised by these organisations.   They\r\n\r\nalso attend courses organised by other Parliaments.   Our\r\n\r\nSpeaker  also visits other Parliaments and the  Presiding\r\n\r\nOfficers   of   these  Parliaments  also  come   to   our\r\n\r\nParliament.    So  do  many  delegations   from   foreign\r\n\r\nParliaments   also   visit  our   Parliament,   and   our\r\n\r\nparliamentarians  themselves  are  also  sent  on   these\r\n\r\ndelegation visits together with our Speaker from time  to\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, on our own, formed several groups of MPs\r\n\r\nwho  may  have  an  interest in a  particular  sector  or\r\n\r\nregion.   For example, we have five parliamentary  groups\r\n\r\n-  Singapore-West  Asia & Africa, Singapore-Asia  Pacific\r\n\r\nRim,   Singapore-Southeast  Asia,  Singapore-Europe   and\r\n\r\nSingapore-Americas groups.  If Mr Chandra  Mohan  is  not\r\n\r\naware  of  these,  he can make inquiries from  Parliament\r\n\r\nand, if he has an interest in any of these organisations,\r\n\r\nplease do so and join them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Branch of the Singapore Parliamentary\r\n\r\nAssociation,   together  with  those  of  Malaysia,   for\r\n\r\nexample, formed the Southeast Asia Regional Branch of the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Parliamentary Association.  The  purpose  of\r\n\r\nthis  Branch, which came into existence in  2001,  is  to\r\n\r\nenable  our parliamentarians in the region, eg, Malaysia,\r\n\r\nto  share  experiences and views amongst  themselves  and\r\n\r\nwith  members of other Parliaments in other parts of  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth.   Our MPs also get in touch regularly  with\r\n\r\nIndonesian MPs.  So, Mr Chandra Mohan can be assured that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  indeed  very close ties with  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\nParliaments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other avenue for contact is the Singapore\r\n\r\nParliamentary Society, which also has relations with  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth   Parliamentary  Association,   the   Inter-Parliamentary  Union  and  the ASEAN  Inter-Parliamentary\r\n\r\nOrganisation.   Every  year, there  is  an  ASEAN  Inter-Parliamentary   Organisation   (AIPO)   meeting.    These\r\n\r\nmeetings   are  rotated  among  the  capitals  of   ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries and many of our MPs take an active part in  it.\r\n\r\nWe  also take part in the various committees of AIPO  and\r\n\r\nwe make valuable contributions at these meetings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also suggested that MPs circulate\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches  and keep each other  informed  of  their\r\n\r\nviews,  so  that they can either reinforce one  another's\r\n\r\nviews  or at least know what the views are, so that  they\r\n\r\nwould  not  repeat  some of these  views.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nrequirement  under  the Standing Orders  for  any  MP  to\r\n\r\ncirculate  their  speeches  in  advance.   In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nParliament Secretariat has checked this up and found that\r\n\r\nthe  UK,  the New Zealand, the Australian, the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nParliaments and even the US Congress do not have  such  a\r\n\r\npractice  of  circulating speeches in advance.   Besides,\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament have different ways of delivering\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches.   Some write down every  word  of  their\r\n\r\nspeech.   Some have a gist of what they want to  say  and\r\n\r\nthey  would  speak from an outline, and some  would  just\r\n\r\nspeak impromptu.  So, it is not practical at all to  have\r\n\r\nMPs circulate their speeches in advance.  The best way is\r\n\r\nreally  for MPs to sit here and listen to what the others\r\n\r\nsay  and, if they happen to miss it, then they could read\r\n\r\nup  the  Hansard and they will know what it is all about,\r\n\r\nand  they can avoid repeating the views, or they may feel\r\n\r\nhappy if others also share their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also suggested that an annual\r\n\r\nreport be made to the citizens.  I am not sure what  that\r\n\r\nmeans, because all our parliamentary proceedings are open\r\n\r\nto  the public.  Anyone who has an interest in Parliament\r\n\r\ncan always come here to observe parliamentary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproceedings.   The  issues,  questions  and  answers  are\r\n\r\nreported  in  the  media,  and parts  of  them  are  also\r\n\r\ntelecast.   The  official records  of  the  parliamentary\r\n\r\nproceedings called the Hansard, are available in hard and\r\n\r\nsoft  copies,  and members of the public can  easily  buy\r\n\r\nthese  from a particular bookshop called Myepb.  So,  our\r\n\r\npublic  is  generally quite aware  of  what  goes  on  in\r\n\r\nParliament,  particularly when there  is  an  issue  that\r\n\r\ninterests  them.   They  know  what  our  MPs  say,  what\r\n\r\nposition  the latter take on these issues. So, I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  a  need  for a separate  report  to  be\r\n\r\nrendered  by  Parliament to the people at  large.   After\r\n\r\nall, the records speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Steve Chia's suggestion to have\r\n\r\nwebcasting  of our parliamentary proceedings,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  a need for webcasting of  parliamentary\r\n\r\nproceedings.   As  I  said earlier,  anyone  who  has  an\r\n\r\ninterest  to know what goes on in Parliament  can  always\r\n\r\ncome  here.   If  he has not got the time  but  wants  to\r\n\r\nlisten  to  a summary of the proceedings, he  can  always\r\n\r\nwatch  the  television  summary  at  night  or  read  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers the following day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried live telecast for key issues. The\r\n\r\nBudget  Speech,  for example, was a live telecast.   From\r\n\r\nthe  ratings,  I  note that not a very  large  number  of\r\n\r\npeople watched the live telecast.  So, I do not think  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  to  have webcasting.   I  know  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  countries which have webcasting.  These are  big\r\n\r\ncountries like the United Kingdom and Australia.  If  you\r\n\r\nhappen to live in Canberra, of course, you can go to  the\r\n\r\nParliament in Canberra.  If you live in London, then  you\r\n\r\ncan  go  to  Westminster.  But if you happen to  live  in\r\n\r\nScotland  or  Wales  or you happen  to  live  in  Western\r\n\r\nAustralia, it is quite a chore to fly to the capitals  to\r\n\r\nlisten to parliamentary proceedings.  In our case, it  is\r\n\r\nvery  simple.  You just take an MRT and drop off at  City\r\n\r\nHall, or take a bus, and you can find your way here.  And\r\n\r\nI do not think it is totally unproductive at all to watch\r\n\r\nwhat  goes  on  on  television when it is  telecast.   If\r\n\r\npeople think it is unproductive to sit here to listen  to\r\n\r\nthe proceedings, then how could it be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproductive for them when they are doing their  work  and,\r\n\r\nat the same time, watch the webcast on their computer?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Mr Chandra Mohan's suggestion to have more\r\n\r\npublicity, our parliamentary proceedings are already open\r\n\r\nto  the  media, both local media as well as  the  foreign\r\n\r\nmedia,  as  I have just said.  The press may  not  be  up\r\n\r\nthere listening to the proceedings, but actually they are\r\n\r\nin  a  different room listening to every word of what  we\r\n\r\nsay.   We cannot tell the press or the media how much  to\r\n\r\nreport.   If there are matters of interest to the public,\r\n\r\nthey  will  report.   If MPs take up  time  and  not  say\r\n\r\nanything  useful to add value, then there is  nothing  to\r\n\r\nreport.  So, really, much depends on the content of  MPs'\r\n\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Parliament is very different from other\r\n\r\nParliaments.   Some people from overseas have  experience\r\n\r\nof  their own Parliaments which are very exciting because\r\n\r\nthere  is drama or fighting.  But ours is quite a  sedate\r\n\r\naffair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Boring!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> \"Boring\" may be the word to use.\r\n\r\nBut, really, we are serious in our purpose.  That is  why\r\n\r\nwhen  we  talk,  we  have  to be objective,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nrationalise,  we have to argue, and we do not  engage  in\r\n\r\ndramatics, just to get television attention.  The  moment\r\n\r\nwe need to get into that, I think we all had it!  So, let\r\n\r\nus  not  make  Parliament  too exciting  just  by  having\r\n\r\ndramatic events in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan asked about the research support to\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  MPs and have specialist staff  to  provide\r\n\r\nsupport to our parliamentary staff so that they can  help\r\n\r\nour  parliamentarians.  If he needs any information  from\r\n\r\nParliament,  all he needs to do is to go to the  Library,\r\n\r\nlook them up himself and, if he cannot find them, ask the\r\n\r\nLibrarian  or  her assistant, I think they will  be  more\r\n\r\nthan willing to help.  But if he asks about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelping him to research a particular topic, that  is  his\r\n\r\njob as an MP.  I do not think anybody can help him to  do\r\n\r\nany  piece  of research if he says he wants to  study  an\r\n\r\narea and to submit a paper on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elected MPs have an allowance for Legislative\r\n\r\nAssistants.   I  know some of my colleagues  have  pooled\r\n\r\ntogether  and  engaged a Legislative  Assistant  to  help\r\n\r\nthem.   This  is  entirely up to them.   The  others  may\r\n\r\ndecide  to  do  their own research and  write  their  own\r\n\r\nspeeches, put their own thoughts on paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court Judges have Justices Clerks, that is\r\n\r\na  different arrangement.  That is a training ground  for\r\n\r\nour  future Judges, our Magistrates, our Legal  Officers,\r\n\r\nand  so on.  So that is a different purpose.  And  it  is\r\n\r\nalso one way of making better use of our talented men and\r\n\r\nwomen who take law as a profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of staff welfare, I want to\r\n\r\nthank  him on behalf of the staff.  He is concerned about\r\n\r\ntheir  welfare.  Indeed, we are also very concerned about\r\n\r\ntheir   welfare.   I  know  the  Speaker  and  the  Clerk\r\n\r\nthemselves  are  also  very  concerned  about  the  staff\r\n\r\nwelfare.  In fact, the staff are quite well looked after.\r\n\r\nThey  have  continuing education and training programmes.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  I  am  told that  four  officers  are  now\r\n\r\nsponsored  by Parliament to pursue higher learning  which\r\n\r\nis  relevant  to  their jobs and leading to  diplomas  or\r\n\r\ndegrees.  Besides this, Parliament officers are also sent\r\n\r\non  attachment to the House of Commons in the UK.   There\r\n\r\nis  a continuous and ongoing process of sending the staff\r\n\r\non  courses,  seminars, workshops and  training  sessions\r\n\r\nthat are relevant to their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the civil service, staff have to be trained a\r\n\r\ncertain  number  of  hours  a  year.   I  am  sure   that\r\n\r\nParliament is also following the same practice, like  the\r\n\r\nrest of the civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> I like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister  for his clarification.

Leader of the House, or his Deputy, having  to\r\n\r\ncome up to the Table to move a motion for an exemption of\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. 1, asking for more time for Parliament\r\n\r\nto  proceed.   This  happens at least 80%  of  the  time.\r\n\r\nPresently,  Sir, the motion to have an exemption  of  the\r\n\r\nrule has become a rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have roughly calculated that the time taken by the\r\n\r\nhon.

You multiply that  by  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of Cabinet Members and the number of our  sitting\r\n\r\ndays  in  a  year,  the amount of man hours  is  worth  a\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we are on this question of timing,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  it is also timely to review the other  Standing\r\n\r\nOrders  of  our Parliament.

We do this not with a sense of disdain as  to\r\n\r\nwhat  has  been  going on, but with an appreciation  that\r\n\r\nthese  rules, now archaic, though maybe, had at one  time\r\n\r\nperformed  their functions.  But still, it is  inevitable\r\n\r\nthat  to  improve ourselves, we have to seek to  innovate\r\n\r\nand to make this constant review.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, indeed the Standing Orders\r\n\r\nhad  been  amended and changed from time  to  time.   For\r\n\r\nthose  of  us who have been long enough in the House,  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  before  1st  March  1985,  the  parliamentary\r\n\r\nproceedings were held between 2.30 pm and 8.00 pm.   That\r\n\r\nwas  a very long period.  I am not sure if Members really\r\n\r\nwant us to go back to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm and 8.00 pm sitting times. If Members really\r\n\r\nthink so and there is enough business for us to do,  then\r\n\r\nwe may have to consider that.  But by 1st March, 1985, we\r\n\r\nthought  that we did not need that, and also  because  we\r\n\r\nwanted to televise parliamentary proceedings and give the\r\n\r\nthen  Singapore Broadcasting Corporation a bit more  time\r\n\r\nto  put  together  a  programme, we brought  forward  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  proceedings to 11.00 am and  4.30  pm,  so\r\n\r\nthat  at  4.30 pm, the SBC could all go back and  do  the\r\n\r\nediting, or whatever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, by another resolution on 16th January 1989, we\r\n\r\nagain changed our sitting times from 12.30 pm to 4.30 pm,\r\n\r\nwhich is the current time in the Standing Orders, because\r\n\r\nwe  found that the parliamentary proceedings telecast  in\r\n\r\nthe  evening  were too long and that there was  not  that\r\n\r\nkind  of interest for members of the public to listen  to\r\n\r\nevery detail of the parliamentary debate.  So, today,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  compact version, ie, a summary of  parliamentary\r\n\r\nproceedings.   We  also moved up the  sitting  time  from\r\n\r\n<br>11.00 am to 12.30 pm in 1989 because Members of\r\n\r\nParliament  found that if they were to be here  at  11.00\r\n\r\nam,  they  had to stop work or whatever at 10.00  am,  in\r\n\r\norder to be in Parliament at 11.00 am.  So we decided  to\r\n\r\nmove  up  to  12.30 pm.  Then, at least the Members  have\r\n\r\ntheir morning free to do their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are constantly reviewing the Standing Orders. We\r\n\r\nwill  of course take into account the need to review  the\r\n\r\nStanding Order No. (1), so that we can avoid the need  to\r\n\r\nhave  it  exempted  at almost every other  sitting.   But\r\n\r\nMembers  may know that when we had our Question Time  for\r\n\r\none hour, we had little need to extend the time to beyond\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm. It was only in the last few years that we\r\n\r\nstarted  to extend the Question Time to 1 1/2 hours  that\r\n\r\nwe  found  the remaining time not adequate to  deal  with\r\n\r\nsome of the topics on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, we would have to look at this and see\r\n\r\nwhether we want to fix the Question Time at 1 1/2  hours,\r\n\r\nor go back to one hour, and what is the appropriate time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  end  the parliamentary sitting.

This  would, in many ways, create  a  just  and\r\n\r\neffective  administration of justice in the eyes  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.   So  I  would suggest that this  be  considered,\r\n\r\nalthough  it may be very isolated cases.  But it  may  be\r\n\r\nuseful  to  have such a mechanism.  And in order  to  get\r\n\r\nlegal  assessors, we can always have people who are  very\r\n\r\nknowledgeable  on that particular matter, like  some  law\r\n\r\nprofessors,  or  some  senior counsel,  or  even  Queen's\r\n\r\nCounsel,  who may be able to assist in many ways  on  the\r\n\r\nadvice given by the Attorney-General's Chambers.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.40 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, you can take the\r\n\r\nnext two cuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, on the issue of Legal\r\n\r\nOfficers   and  Deputy  Public  Prosecutors,  the   Legal\r\n\r\nOfficers are qualified persons under the Legal Profession\r\n\r\nAct and under the Constitution would be graduates of law.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  suggest whether  it  is  feasible  to\r\n\r\nconsider  dividing  between Legal Officers  and  Judicial\r\n\r\nOfficers.   The  Legal  Officers are  legal  advisors  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  Departments  and  they  are  mainly  at   the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's Chambers where they are  either  State\r\n\r\nCounsel dealing with civil matters, civil law, or  Deputy\r\n\r\nPublic Prosecutors dealing with criminal matters.  You do\r\n\r\nhave  in  the  present  setup  under  the  Legal  Service\r\n\r\nCommission   the  transfer  of  Legal  Officers   to   be\r\n\r\nMagistrates or District Judges also.  At times,  a  setup\r\n\r\nlike  that might create some concern that a Legal Officer\r\n\r\nbecoming  a  Magistrate or District Judge may  pose  some\r\n\r\nproblems, although there has not been any case in  point.\r\n\r\nBut  would  it  be feasible to have a judicial  institute\r\n\r\nwhere our young lawyers can be trained to be judges,  and\r\n\r\nthe  procedures and behavioural attitudes of these  young\r\n\r\nlawyers  to be good judges?  It might be a good  idea  to\r\n\r\nhave such an institute.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Deputy Public Prosecutors, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  system that we have right now is that they  are  all\r\n\r\nLegal  Service officers.  In England, there  is  what  is\r\n\r\nknown  as  a  Director  of Public Prosecutions,  and  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Public  Prosecutors, so to  speak,  are  actually\r\n\r\nbarristers who may be a prosecutor one day and, the  next\r\n\r\nday, he may be defence counsel.  Is it possible for us to\r\n\r\nconsider the feasibility of having an equivalent  system,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Deputy Public Prosecutors can  be  practising\r\n\r\nlawyers  who  may  be  conducting  prosecutions  and,  on\r\n\r\nanother  occasion, be defence counsel?  This  serves  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  showing to the public that these prosecutors\r\n\r\nare  impartial  and independent, and  they  may  carry  a\r\n\r\nbetter weightage, compared to what we have now.  This  is\r\n\r\nsomething  worth  pursuing and, for a  start,  if  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething  worthwhile, perhaps, in  terms  of  trust,  we\r\n\r\ncould consider the ex-District Judges or Magistrates,  or\r\n\r\neven  ex-DPPs who may be in private practice  to  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  prosecutors.   And, as it develops,  perhaps  this\r\n\r\nidea  of  having  prosecutors, both from  the  practising\r\n\r\nfield  and from the State, could be enhanced in the years\r\n\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho Peng Kee, would you like to\r\n\r\nreply first?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan's first point is\r\n\r\nwhether or not we need to appoint legal assessors to help\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General or to give an opinion on the opinion\r\n\r\nthat the Attorney-General has given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think there is a problem with that because,\r\n\r\nas  Mr  Mohan knows, the Attorney-General, as he  himself\r\n\r\nhas  said,  has  two basic functions.  He  is  the  chief\r\n\r\nadviser  to  the  Government, and he is also  the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor.  In discharging his constitutional functions,\r\n\r\nhe  does it as a professional.  Mr Mohan would know that,\r\n\r\nin Singapore, the Attorney-General is a professional, not\r\n\r\na  political  office  holder,  like  in  some  countries.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as a professional Attorney-General, it is very\r\n\r\nimportant - and I am sure Mr Mohan will agree -  that  he\r\n\r\nmaintains his reputation, not just with Singaporeans, but\r\n\r\nalso with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney-Generals of the Commonwealth with whom he  meets\r\n\r\nevery few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Mohan's proposal, if it is implemented, is\r\n\r\nnot practical or prudent.  I think he asked whether it is\r\n\r\npractical or prudent.  Because, if nothing else, to  some\r\n\r\npeople,  it  may cast some aspersions and doubts  on  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  or  independent mindedness  of  the  Attorney-General.   I  fully appreciate Mr Mohan's good intentions\r\n\r\nin  making  that suggestion.  But I think it is something\r\n\r\nwhich  has  not been done and, in our view, need  not  be\r\n\r\ndone.   After  all,  if we subject the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nopinions  or  some  of his opinions - I  think  Mr  Mohan\r\n\r\nmentioned  sensitive opinions involving political  office\r\n\r\nholders - to a third party, the question that will  arise\r\n\r\nis: who should we appoint as a third party?  He mentioned\r\n\r\na senior law professor, but who is to say that the senior\r\n\r\nlaw  professor will not be impartial?  After all,  unlike\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General, he does not hold a  constitutional\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, probably Mr Mohan did not intend it, but if we\r\n\r\nonly  use  such  a  third  party  for  these  politically\r\n\r\nsensitive  cases,  then what is the message  being  sent.\r\n\r\nAgain,  the  message  is  a wrong  message.   Either  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  cannot, will not or does  not  exercise\r\n\r\nimpartiality  in  these cases, all  of  which  are  wrong\r\n\r\nbecause,   notwithstanding  a  political   figure   being\r\n\r\nprosecuted - whether a Minister or Member of Parliament - I am sure Mr Mohan agrees with me fully that the Attorney-General exercises his discretion under Article 35  fairly\r\n\r\nand  impartially.   Of  course, like  other  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries,  he does not give detailed reasoning  for  his\r\n\r\ndecisions, but the outcome of his decisions is for all to\r\n\r\nsee and for all to question, if it is something which  is\r\n\r\nreally   not   defensible.  And  the  Government,   where\r\n\r\nnecessary - and this has happened in the instance that Mr\r\n\r\nMohan   mentioned,   the  investigations   into   certain\r\n\r\npoliticians,  both Government and Opposition,  after  the\r\n\r\n1997 elections - his opinion was in fact released in this\r\n\r\nHouse.   There  was great public interest and,  for  that\r\n\r\nreason,  a  rare  instance,  but  to  meet  this   public\r\n\r\ninterest, his decision was released.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that Mr Mohan says that, outside\r\n\r\nof  prosecutions, the Attorney-General may  also  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  the inputs of a third party, ie, a QC or some other\r\n\r\nparty,  when  he  acts  as  the  chief  adviser  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and he mentioned, for example, disputes  with\r\n\r\nother countries.  Actually, the Attorney-General does, if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  seek a silk's, ie, a QC's, opinion  from  the\r\n\r\nUK,  if  it  is  a  matter which is  intricate  or  where\r\n\r\nexpertise  may reside in a particular person  or  persons\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore.  But having said this,  let  me  also\r\n\r\nassure  Mr  Mohan  that, over the  years,  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers  has developed expertise  in  various\r\n\r\nfields  amongst  its officers.  I am sure  he  will  know\r\n\r\nthat,  especially under the current Attorney-General,  Mr\r\n\r\nChan  Sek  Keong, the AG's Chambers has  been  beefed  up\r\n\r\ntremendously.   It now has five divisions:  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nDivision,    Civil   Division,   Law   Reform   Division,\r\n\r\nInternational Division and the Legislation Division, each\r\n\r\nof  which  is  manned  by  very  senior  and  experienced\r\n\r\nofficers.  So, I would like to assure him that  there  is\r\n\r\nenough expertise in the AG's Chambers to handle the  work\r\n\r\nthat  will benefit Singapore and, if necessary,  he  does\r\n\r\ntake outside opinion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that Mr Mohan made is whether or not\r\n\r\nwe  should have separate services for Legal Officers, eg,\r\n\r\nthose  in  the  judicial service, the Subordinate  Courts\r\n\r\nofficers,  and  those who are non-judicial officers,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe  DPPs and those in the Ministries.  I should say that\r\n\r\nwe  are a small Legal Service.  I think we have got  less\r\n\r\nthan 300 officers in the Legal Service.  So, the call for\r\n\r\nspecialisation is, in fact, also not practical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To nurture well-rounded, developed officers, it is\r\n\r\nbetter  for them to be posted to the various departments.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this is being done.  I am sure Mr Mohan will not\r\n\r\nwant  to see our judicial officers too focused.  He  even\r\n\r\nmade  the point that judicial officers may be too  narrow\r\n\r\nand  focused  and, therefore, we should have  a  judicial\r\n\r\ninstitute to train them up and to round them off in other\r\n\r\nareas.  So, for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurposes of career development, officers are posted  from\r\n\r\namongst  the areas of work, not just from the Subordinate\r\n\r\nCourts  to  a  non-judicial post, but  even  amongst  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  the AG's Chambers.  That  is  the  first\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that it is important that we\r\n\r\narrest  any false perception that may be created even  by\r\n\r\nthis  suggestion  whether or not, for  example,  a  Legal\r\n\r\nOfficer  serving  in  the  judiciary,  because   of   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  being posted out,  he  may  be  entirely\r\n\r\nimpartial.   Again, we should put this to  rest,  because\r\n\r\nour judicial officers take a very serious oath of office.\r\n\r\nParticularly in the Subordinate Courts, over many  years,\r\n\r\nunder  the  current  Senior  District  Judge,  they  have\r\n\r\ninstilled  important  values  in  the  Subordinate  Court\r\n\r\nofficers.   There  is  a  justice statement,  a  code  of\r\n\r\nethics,  and there are also values which are embraced  by\r\n\r\nthe Subordinate Court Judges.  In any case, all movements\r\n\r\nin  the  Legal  Service  are made by  the  Legal  Service\r\n\r\nCommission,  which is chaired by the Chief  Justice.   On\r\n\r\nthe  Legal  Service Commission sit the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission, the AG, a High Court Judge, as\r\n\r\nwell  as  two  members nominated by  the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.   Currently, these two members are  prominent\r\n\r\nbusiness  people  from  the private  sector.   They  will\r\n\r\nimpartially and objectively look at how officers ought to\r\n\r\nbe  rotated,  based  on  the  officers'  temperament  and\r\n\r\nperformance.  So, we should put this to rest,  that  this\r\n\r\nis a system which is working.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we have a judicial institute? This pertains\r\n\r\nto the training of our judicial officers.  Here again, we\r\n\r\nare  small, unlike big countries such as the US,  UK  and\r\n\r\nAustralia,   where  they  may  have  such  an  institute.\r\n\r\nTraining of judges in the Subordinate Courts happens  all\r\n\r\nthe time.  It is something where emphasis has been put by\r\n\r\nthe current Senior District Judge.  For example, they  go\r\n\r\nfor  training courses.  Last year, the Subordinate Courts\r\n\r\norganised about 37 such courses. There is also a  lot  of\r\n\r\ninteraction of judges with members of the profession  and\r\n\r\nother   professional  bodies,  such  as  the  SISV,   the\r\n\r\nAssociation of Banks in Singapore, and also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunity groups.  The point therefore is that we do  not\r\n\r\nneed   a  judicial  institute  to  institutionalise   the\r\n\r\ntraining   of   lawyers.   The  nurturing   of   judicial\r\n\r\ntemperament and the developing of expertise go on all the\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, again, I take Mr Mohan's suggestion very\r\n\r\npositively.  He feels that it is good for our judges  not\r\n\r\nto  be  too  isolated,  but always be  mindful  that,  as\r\n\r\njudges,  they should also be updating themselves all  the\r\n\r\ntime, not just in terms of the laws but also in terms  of\r\n\r\nsocial skills and interaction with lawyers, and also what\r\n\r\nis happening out there.  As a senior member of the Bar, I\r\n\r\nam sure he would have read the Annual Reports of both the\r\n\r\nSupreme   Court   and  the  Subordinate   Courts   which,\r\n\r\nincidentally,  are voluntarily published by  the  courts.\r\n\r\nIt is an initiative which the courts themselves felt they\r\n\r\nshould  do,  to  create more openness, more transparency.\r\n\r\nMr  Mohan  will see in those reports the great amount  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes being mounted to ensure that the judges are up\r\n\r\nto the mark.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, can you speak on\r\n\r\nyour third cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, on the issue of right\r\n\r\nof  appeal  in criminal cases, may I bring up this  point\r\n\r\nthat most of the criminal cases are tried or heard in the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts.  If there is an appeal, either by the\r\n\r\nprosecution or by the defence, then it goes to  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt  before one High Court Judge.  Usually, it is heard\r\n\r\nby  the  honourable  Chief Justice.  If  the  prosecution\r\n\r\nfails  in  the appeal, then the prosecution is  entitled,\r\n\r\nunder the Supreme Court Judicature Act, to appeal to  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Appeal as the final arbiter of that particular\r\n\r\ncase.   If  the accused should fail in his appeal  before\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court  judge,  then he  is  not  automatically\r\n\r\nentitled  to appeal to the Court of Appeal unless  it  is\r\n\r\nwhat  is  known  as a \"point of public interest\"  or  the\r\n\r\nlike.   In other words, the accused has one step  towards\r\n\r\nthe  appeal,  as compared to the prosecution  having  two\r\n\r\nsteps, so to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is so, would it be timely to consider the\r\n\r\nposition  of  fairness  to both sides  and  granting  the\r\n\r\naccused  the  right to also go to the  Court  of  Appeal,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding whether it is a point of public  interest\r\n\r\nor not, so that, in the eyes of the public, it is seen to\r\n\r\nbe  in  terms of rights of appeal, it would be  equal  to\r\n\r\nboth the prosecution and the accused person.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, before I take this\r\n\r\npoint,  I  think I missed out an earlier  point  from  Mr\r\n\r\nMohan about using private sector lawyers as DPPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here again, one has to question whether it is\r\n\r\npractical and whether or not there is a need. We have got\r\n\r\na  very strong Criminal Justice Division in the Attorney-General's Chambers, both in terms of the expertise  which\r\n\r\nresides  there, as well as the number of DPPs, now  aided\r\n\r\nby Assistant Public Prosecutors who prosecute minor cases\r\n\r\nin  the Subordinate Courts.  Over the years, as Mr  Mohan\r\n\r\nwould  know, the work of the DPPs is such that a decision\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  to prosecute is taken  very  seriously.\r\n\r\nThere  are  different  levels  or  tiers  of  evaluation,\r\n\r\nparticularly for the more serious offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are quite unlike England, which Mr Mohan\r\n\r\nmentioned, for example, where there is division  of  work\r\n\r\nbetween  a solicitor, barrister and the Crown Prosecution\r\n\r\nService.    Crucially,  the  Crown  Prosecution   Service\r\n\r\nhandles  all issues relating to prosecutorial  discretion\r\n\r\nand  policy. So, that still resides in the equivalent  of\r\n\r\nour Criminal Justice Division.  It is only when the Crown\r\n\r\nProsecution   Service  decides  to   proceed   with   the\r\n\r\nprosecution that it instructs a barrister to conduct  the\r\n\r\ncourt   proceedings.   In  such  instances,   the   Crown\r\n\r\nProsecution Service solicitor attends the court  to  give\r\n\r\ninstructions  to the barrister whenever  necessary.   The\r\n\r\nbarrister merely conducts a case in court.  He  does  not\r\n\r\nmake  any  prosecutorial decisions.   And  even  then,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand   that,   increasingly,   this   practice   of\r\n\r\ninstructing  barristers is done only  in  serious  cases.\r\n\r\nFor   summary  trials,  the  Crown  Prosecution   Service\r\n\r\nconducts its own prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, herein lies the difference because, as Mr Mohan\r\n\r\nwould  be  very well aware of, in Singapore,  ours  is  a\r\n\r\nfused  profession. In England, you are tapping the skills\r\n\r\nand  expertise  of a special group of people  to  present\r\n\r\nyour case in court.  But I think, more fundamentally, the\r\n\r\nissue  that  would  arise is also the fair-mindedness  of\r\n\r\nsuch  private sector lawyers who are engaged to prosecute\r\n\r\nsuch  cases  in court.  Mr Mohan mentioned  ex-DPPs,  but\r\n\r\nthere  again, an ex-DPP would also be someone who  is  in\r\n\r\nthe marketplace.  For example, he may be a lawyer.  So he\r\n\r\nmay  have  dealings  with the person he  is  prosecuting,\r\n\r\nquite unlike the full-time Deputy Public Prosecutors  who\r\n\r\nwould  be  legally  under  a professional  obligation  to\r\n\r\nremain  detached, not just in terms of court proceedings,\r\n\r\nbut  also  in  terms  of his professional  dealings  with\r\n\r\npeople  who are being prosecuted. Here again, I think  it\r\n\r\nis  a  well-meaning  suggestion  but  not  practical  nor\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last point that Mr Mohan makes is a point which\r\n\r\nwe  have debated several times before in this House.  But\r\n\r\nlet  me  first  say  that it is not  a  question  of  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General having a second right of appeal because,\r\n\r\nwhen the Attorney-General makes a reference under section\r\n\r\n60  of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, it is not  an\r\n\r\nappeal as such, since the outcome of the reference  would\r\n\r\nnot  jeopardise  the accused person if  it  is  found  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  the  Attorney-General.  I think  that  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  point.   That is the practice  that  has  been\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Attorney-General in making such references.\r\n\r\nIt  is important for him to have this access to the Court\r\n\r\nof  Appeal  under  section 60 reference because,  as  the\r\n\r\nchief advisor to the Government, it is important that any\r\n\r\ndoubts arising from the High Court's decision - when  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court decides an appeal - should be clarified.   And\r\n\r\nthat  is  why  the  law gives him this opportunity,  this\r\n\r\nability, this avenue, where he can make a reference.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the question therefore would be: why not make two\r\n\r\ntiers  of appeal available to everybody?  Here again,  we\r\n\r\nhave debated this point in extenso before.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just a matter of how many tiers of appeal\r\n\r\nthere  are  but,  really, how seriously the  appeals  are\r\n\r\ntaken,  the  quality of the judgments that are  rendered,\r\n\r\nboth  by the first instance judge and also by the  Appeal\r\n\r\njudge.   And in Singapore, as we know, we do have  judges\r\n\r\nwho are very serious in what they do. And the quality  of\r\n\r\njudgment,  for example, of the Subordinate  Court  judges\r\n\r\nhas  gone  up  over  time.  I understand  that  now,  the\r\n\r\naverage  experience  of  the  Judicial  Officers  in  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts would be about 13 years.  I think that\r\n\r\nis an important point to clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, can you withdraw\r\n\r\nyour amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister  of State.

Would it  be  useful  to\r\n\r\nconsider, in the course of the appointment of judges,  to\r\n\r\nmake an assessment of these persons who are qualified and\r\n\r\nto  be interviewed by a panel to see what their views are\r\n\r\non  certain aspects of life, including important  aspects\r\n\r\nthat  would  reflect  on  the  mind  of  the  judge?  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  America, before a judge  is  appointed,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  there  is  such  a  course   where   an\r\n\r\nassessment  is made of his views on matters,  prejudices,\r\n\r\netc.   In  our  case, I believe that  there  is  no  such\r\n\r\nmachinery.  Would this be an improvement in the system of\r\n\r\nappointment of our High Court judges?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Mohan, you can take the rest of\r\n\r\nthe cuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> On the issue of revamp of\r\n\r\nthe  court system, criminal justice system and litigation\r\n\r\ncosts, may I say that when we look at the court system in\r\n\r\nSingapore, many people argue that legal costs  are  going\r\n\r\nup  and litigants may be fearful of litigating because of\r\n\r\nthe legal costs involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On issues of criminal law, constitutional law and\r\n\r\nadministrative  law, it may be useful to consider  having\r\n\r\nwhat  is known as a constitutional court.  I believe that\r\n\r\nin  some  jurisdictions,  they  have,  including  Taiwan,\r\n\r\nwhere, if  there is a constitutional issue to be decided,\r\n\r\nthere  must be a machinery for the litigant to raise  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  issue  at minimal  cost.   Because,  very\r\n\r\noften, when you have to raise such issues, it may  be  an\r\n\r\nexpensive affair.  And I think in some jurisdictions, you\r\n\r\nhave  a  constitutional court which would decide  on  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional issues of that case because, based on  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional findings, the case might go on or  not  go\r\n\r\non, especially in criminal matters.  So, I would like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that the authorities look into the possibility of\r\n\r\nhaving  a  constitutional court which provides  for  this\r\n\r\nservice  free where a litigant can bring it to the  court\r\n\r\nand get\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na ruling from the court before it is proceeded with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the other aspects, Sir, may I also\r\n\r\npropose that the criminal justice system be revisited  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  effectiveness of the various  sentencing\r\n\r\nprinciples and systems that we have got in Singapore,  to\r\n\r\nsee  what  is  the  best system to be  adopted,  and  how\r\n\r\neffective the sentencing system has been, in terms of the\r\n\r\nincrease or decrease of the crime rates in Singapore  for\r\n\r\nthe  past  5-10  years.  And from this,  perhaps  lessons\r\n\r\ncould  be learnt for the whole legal fraternity  and  for\r\n\r\nthe citizenry at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also, on the issue of legal costs, the talk\r\n\r\nthat  litigation costs are going up all the time.  May  I\r\n\r\nask  if  we  could  do a study to find  out  whether  the\r\n\r\nlitigation  costs,  both in the private  sector  and,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  courts, whether these have gone  up  with  the\r\n\r\nrevamping  of the court system, the computerisation  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  in  Singapore,  and  what  is  the  feeling  of\r\n\r\ncitizens?  They all seem to complain, rightly or wrongly,\r\n\r\nthat costs have gone up, and sometimes the impression  is\r\n\r\ncreated that it is the lawyers who are charging more.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be feasible to do a study on this matter to find out\r\n\r\nwhat it is and how we can try and contain legal costs, if\r\n\r\nthey are on the rise, as best as we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> First, on the point about\r\n\r\nappointing  judges.  Sir, we have a system which  is  not\r\n\r\nunlike  other Commonwealth countries where  there  is  no\r\n\r\npublic  hearing.   I think Mr Mohan talks  about  the  US\r\n\r\nwhere judges, before they are appointed, are subject to a\r\n\r\npublic  hearing,  as a result of which,  good  candidates\r\n\r\nsometimes  also  get knocked off.  Even  then,  with  the\r\n\r\nhearings, you cannot ensure that the judges would be  top\r\n\r\nquality  or,  indeed,  whether  or  not  they  would   be\r\n\r\npolitically   inclined,  as  we   saw   from   the   last\r\n\r\nPresidential  elections in the  US.   Then,  the  Florida\r\n\r\nCourt had to decide on certain important issues where the\r\n\r\nposition of the judges and their inclinations were put in\r\n\r\nthe  limelight.  So I think what is really  important  is\r\n\r\nthe care with which our judges are appointed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, as Mr Mohan has mentioned, under the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  for  High  Court  Judges,  the   President\r\n\r\nappoints on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, who\r\n\r\nconsults  the Chief Justice.  So what better  system  can\r\n\r\nthere be because the Chief Justice would be somebody  who\r\n\r\nhas   interacted  with  these  future  judges  at   close\r\n\r\nquarters,  either as members of the Bar in arguing  cases\r\n\r\nbefore him, or members of the Legal Service, with whom he\r\n\r\nalso  has interactions, particularly as Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nLegal Service Commission.  So, I am sure Mr Mohan is  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the quality of our High Court  Judges  is\r\n\r\nnot  up to the mark, because he will know recently  there\r\n\r\nwas a fresh spate of appointments in the High Court, some\r\n\r\nof whom had served a few years as Judicial Commissioners,\r\n\r\nand  indeed  a few of whom had very varied experience  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bar.   They  were top litigators in various  fields.\r\n\r\nSo,  we  have a Bench which is very diverse, coming  from\r\n\r\ndifferent  backgrounds,  different  expertise,  and   all\r\n\r\nhelping  to  uphold the standard of justice in Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  also  to  help build Singapore up as a  place  where\r\n\r\npeople  can do business and also in terms of us  being  a\r\n\r\nfinancial and investment centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule of law is important. The quality of our\r\n\r\njudiciary  is  important.  I am sure Mr Mohan  will  know\r\n\r\nabout the many surveys and polls that have been conducted\r\n\r\nby reputable outside bodies, the Swiss-based Institute of\r\n\r\nManagement  Development's World  Competitiveness  Report,\r\n\r\nand  the  Political and Economic Risk Consultancy Report,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  Hong  Kong-based.  This shows that,  not  only\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  but also people who use our services,  who\r\n\r\nare   businessmen  from  outside  Singapore,   rate   our\r\n\r\njudiciary highly.  So that is the first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point relates to the Constitutional\r\n\r\nCourt.    I  think  Mr  Mohan  asked  why  not   have   a\r\n\r\nConstitutional   Court  where  Singaporeans   and   other\r\n\r\nlitigants or people who feel that their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstitutional rights have been breached can use free  of\r\n\r\ncharge.   I think that is quite a novel suggestion.   But\r\n\r\nwill  it  result in abuse, because then people  who  feel\r\n\r\nthat their rights have been breached, rightly or wrongly,\r\n\r\nwould come to the court?  The question really to ask  is:\r\n\r\nwhat  happens  now?  Is it because Singaporeans  have  no\r\n\r\nrecourse?   No  place to go if they want  to  vent  their\r\n\r\nrights,  vis--vis constitutional provisions  or  to  seek\r\n\r\njudicial review of executive actions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other Commonwealth countries, not all of whom\r\n\r\nhave  Constitutional Courts - I think Mr Mohan  mentioned\r\n\r\nTaiwan,  Thailand  also has it -  every  country  has  to\r\n\r\ndetermine its own path.  That is an important point.  So,\r\n\r\nfor  us  in  Singapore, our constitutional structure  and\r\n\r\nlegal   system   is  such  that  issues   pertaining   to\r\n\r\nconstitutional  laws  can  be  decided  by  the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncourts,  and  indeed this has been done.  I  am  sure  Mr\r\n\r\nMohan  will  know  in  the law reports  there  have  been\r\n\r\nparties,  either  by  bringing  up  judicial  action  for\r\n\r\nmandamus, certiorari or habeas-corpus, or as a defence in\r\n\r\nthe  prosecution, will raise the argument that his or her\r\n\r\nconstitutional rights have been breached.  The court will\r\n\r\nthen examine the issue.  Hence, the recourse is there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the question will be asked: are there so many\r\n\r\ncases  that surface that we need a separately-constituted\r\n\r\nConstitutional Court?  Even though the recourse is there,\r\n\r\nthe  cases  are  not that many over the  years.   So  one\r\n\r\nreason  could be that in Singapore the rule of  law  does\r\n\r\nprevail.  Our policy makers and our civil servants,  when\r\n\r\nwe make policies and we implement them, we are mindful of\r\n\r\nthe  need to keep within the Constitution.  And, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to attribute this also to an initiative of the  AGC\r\n\r\nand   MinLaw   where   we  conduct   constitutional   and\r\n\r\nadministrative law seminars for our senior civil servants\r\n\r\nonce  a year - we have done four now - so that our  civil\r\n\r\nservants who are helping Ministers to devise policies and\r\n\r\nhelp  to implement them would be mindful that they should\r\n\r\nnot do anything that will breach the Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that Mr Mohan makes is sentencing.\r\n\r\nAgain, as a senior practitioner\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the courts, Mr Mohan will know that sentencing policy\r\n\r\nis   really  under  the  ambit  of  the  courts.   Whilst\r\n\r\nParliament  passes  laws  and  when  we  pass  laws,  the\r\n\r\nlegislation will set the range of punishments,  in  terms\r\n\r\nof  what  punishment to exact in a particular  case  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  decided by the Judge who hears the case.   This\r\n\r\nmust be so because he hears the case, he knows the facts,\r\n\r\nhe  looks  at all the other factors, including mitigating\r\n\r\nfactors.  He has to find guilt first.  If there is guilt,\r\n\r\nhe  decides  where  he should punish the  person  on  the\r\n\r\ncontinuum,  the  range of sentences that  Parliament  has\r\n\r\nset.  So, the courts have got sentencing guidelines which\r\n\r\nis   important,  because  they  will  contribute  towards\r\n\r\ngreater  consistency.   This is one  feature  of  a  good\r\n\r\nsystem, where despite the fact that different judges  may\r\n\r\nhear different cases, if the facts are similar, or if the\r\n\r\noffence    committed   is   committed    under    similar\r\n\r\ncircumstances, if the factors are similar, the  sentences\r\n\r\nshould not vary too much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the courts have put a lot of efforts\r\n\r\ninto  this matter, including, I understand, publishing  a\r\n\r\nbook.   The Subordinate Courts have published a  book  on\r\n\r\nsentencing practices, which is written by the  judges  in\r\n\r\ntheir  free time.  I am told, and I think it is  probably\r\n\r\ntrue,  this is a first in the world.  So, we should leave\r\n\r\nit  as  that because tough sentences which are meted  out\r\n\r\nare meted out for a reason, in particular, to reflect the\r\n\r\nseriousness of a particular offence or the gravity of the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  of  the  crime or the  prevalence  of  the\r\n\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that Mr Chandra Mohan makes is on\r\n\r\nlegal costs.  First, I should say that, compared to quite\r\n\r\na  few countries, legal costs in Singapore have not  gone\r\n\r\nup very much.  In fact, Mr Mohan would probably know that\r\n\r\nover  the years, because of competition, because  of  the\r\n\r\nfact that there are more law firms, more lawyers, and the\r\n\r\npie is growing smaller, there is a need to do other kinds\r\n\r\nof work and so lawyers are quite prepared, they give good\r\n\r\nservices  but at competitive prices.  So from that  point\r\n\r\nof view, lawyer's costs have not gone up exponentially as\r\n\r\nmuch as other jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the courts? Mr Mohan is probably alluding\r\n\r\nto fees introduced by the courts - hearing fees and court\r\n\r\nfees  -  which  again  are not only  done  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nHearing  fees were introduced in 1992 for good reasons  - to  make sure that those who hoard court's time will have\r\n\r\nto   pay  for  it  and  also  to  dissuade  parties  from\r\n\r\nstretching their cases.  The fact that the first  day  of\r\n\r\nhearing  is  free means that, if lawyers are  mindful  of\r\n\r\nstructuring  their  arguments and preparing  their  cases\r\n\r\nwell,  then  costs for their clients can be minimised  or\r\n\r\nreduced.   And,  here again, hearing  fees  is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  other countries also have.  Recently,  of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  courts increased the hearing fees.  We have  debated\r\n\r\nin  this  House the reasons for that.  I gave the reasons\r\n\r\nwhy.   The  courts themselves have given the reasons  why\r\n\r\nhearing fees have to be increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, let me add that a survey was done\r\n\r\nsome  time ago, about 2-3 years ago on hearing and filing\r\n\r\nfees,  court  imposed fees, and it was found  that  court\r\n\r\nfees  only  constitute about 7-8% of  the  total  fees  a\r\n\r\nlitigant  has  to  pay in the High Court.   That  is  the\r\n\r\nperspective.  No doubt, parties have to pay fees in court\r\n\r\nbut  it is not as though it is a large percentage of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  cost he has to pay.  With the lawyers'  fee  being\r\n\r\ncontained - for example, conveyancing fees, we know  that\r\n\r\nwith   the  lifting  of  the  scale  fees,  quite  likely\r\n\r\nconveyancing fees will stabilise or come down  and  also,\r\n\r\nwith  lawyers  having  to  look for  work,  for  example,\r\n\r\ndivorce cases, I am sure that lawyers doing divorces will\r\n\r\ntell  you  that  again  it  is  very  competitive  -  the\r\n\r\nsituation is not alarming, as some may feel.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  Mr  Mohan  painted  that  picture,  but  certainly\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can  now shop around for lawyers  who  will\r\n\r\ngive good quality services at fair rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, of course, is that Government has\r\n\r\nintroduced various measures so that Singaporeans who have\r\n\r\nrights to ventilate or grievances to air will have  these\r\n\r\nother  avenues to turn to.  For example, MinLaw initiated\r\n\r\n4-5  years ago Community Mediation Centres, so that minor\r\n\r\ndisputes on the ground, relational\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisputes,  should not end up in court.  They  can  settle\r\n\r\nthem  quite  easily and quite cheaply if the parties  are\r\n\r\nagreeable.   Small Claims Tribunal was started  about  10\r\n\r\nyears  ago.   We  have enhanced the jurisdiction  of  the\r\n\r\nSmall  Claims  Tribunal and made them more accessible  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  So, with this and other avenues, mediation\r\n\r\nnow  is becoming more popular.  CASE, for example,  would\r\n\r\nbe mediating some of the disputes arising from the Office\r\n\r\nof  Fair Trading.  Seen in perspective, Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nhave  a  need  to seek redress, first of  all,  need  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily go to the courts, and even if they do,  there\r\n\r\nare means by which they can control costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Mohan, can you withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister of State.

The resilience  of\r\n\r\nthe  profession  in those times seems to  be  remarkable.\r\n\r\nHowever,  during  this  current  economic  downturn,  the\r\n\r\nprofession  seems  not to have been  spared.

At such  a\r\n\r\ntime, the question that is uppermost in the minds\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  interested parties is:  what is the legal  profession\r\n\r\nactually doing?  Is it capable of self-renewal?   Is  the\r\n\r\nprofession  retraining its members to meet the challenges\r\n\r\nof  the  future?  Sir, I understand that the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLaw  has,  together  with the Department  of  Statistics,\r\n\r\ncompleted  a census of the legal profession.   Would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  care to share with this House the key  findings\r\n\r\nof  this census, in particular, would he also address the\r\n\r\nfollowing  queries?   How can we ensure  that  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession  remain attractive to young lawyers  who  form\r\n\r\nthe  majority of those leaving the profession every year?\r\n\r\nSir, the attrition rate in the profession hovers around 7-9%  a year.  This, in itself, is not a bad thing, but  if\r\n\r\nthe majority of those leaving are young lawyers, then the\r\n\r\nprofession will have a hard time regenerating itself.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, are our law firms restructuring to be of an\r\n\r\noptimal  size  to  compete on a global  basis  with  well\r\n\r\nestablished  law firms from other jurisdictions,  notably\r\n\r\nthe US, the UK and Australia?  Do we have the calibre  of\r\n\r\nlawyers to compete?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signing of the various Free Trade Agreements\r\n\r\nusually  includes services, and that would  also  include\r\n\r\nlegal services.  Does this mean more competition for  our\r\n\r\nlocal  lawyers?  Are they ready for it or will more leave\r\n\r\nthe profession when the competition gets too tough?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, has the Ministry or the profession managed\r\n\r\nto  identify growth areas in the legal services industry?\r\n\r\nIf  so, could the Minister share with us what these areas\r\n\r\nare, and tell us whether the law firms are responding  to\r\n\r\nthese new challenges?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the health and the vitality of the legal system\r\n\r\nis  of  crucial  importance in Singapore's  objective  to\r\n\r\nremake  itself, and to pursue the strategies and policies\r\n\r\nthat  the DPM and Finance Minister has mapped out for  us\r\n\r\nin  his latest Budget speech.  It is imperative that  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  of  the  legal  profession,  where   the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial instincts ought to be the  strongest,  be\r\n\r\npoised to offer better\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  more  varied  legal services to  the  community  and\r\n\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

I, like him, would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister for Law as to what were the findings\r\n\r\nof  the  study that was undertaken in the year 2001  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the legal profession.  And, in particular,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  find out what are the new directions  or\r\n\r\nsteps that the Ministry of Law will be taking to help the\r\n\r\nlegal  profession  to  ensure that many  younger  lawyers\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  stay in the profession,  so  that  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to have a vibrant legal profession in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  in  partnership with the judicial  system,  to\r\n\r\nensure that law is both accessible and, at the same time,\r\n\r\ncost effective for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, like my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues before me, I too would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  the  findings  of the Legal  Centre's  survey.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to  that,  I  would like to  know  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister  could assure the House that there  will  be  an\r\n\r\nadequate  supply of lawyers in terms of the intake.   The\r\n\r\nreason  I  ask  is  because  some  years  back,  we   had\r\n\r\nrestricted the number of lawyers with the result that the\r\n\r\nsupply was inadequate to meet the demand.  The fact  that\r\n\r\nthere are young lawyers leaving the profession is not  in\r\n\r\nitself  necessarily a bad thing.  One of the reasons  why\r\n\r\nthey  leave  is because they now have a lot  of  options.\r\n\r\nThey  can  go  inhouse or they can go to offshore  firms.\r\n\r\nThat  is  not  something  that  was  available  to  young\r\n\r\ngraduates when I graduated more years ago than I care  to\r\n\r\nremember.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that I should perhaps highlight - and I am not sure whether this is in the Centre - is that\r\n\r\nthere  are, in fact, lawyers who are coming back  to  the\r\n\r\nprofession.   This  is a recent phenomenon  which  I  had\r\n\r\nnoticed as a practitioner.  In our firm, in the past year\r\n\r\nor  two,  we have actually had four of our prodigal  sons\r\n\r\nand  daughters return to us.  The reasons why  they  left\r\n\r\nwere they wanted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  broaden their horizons; they wanted to try  something\r\n\r\ndifferent.  Two became inhouse counsel with IT companies;\r\n\r\none became a bank consultant; another wanted to try drama\r\n\r\nand  theatre.  All of them have come back, and  a  common\r\n\r\nthread  seems to be that it is the intellectual challenge\r\n\r\nof  the  work that has attracted them.  So, for  whatever\r\n\r\nreasons,  they seem particularly addicted to our peculiar\r\n\r\nform  of  stress,  and  have decided  to  return  to  the\r\n\r\nprofession.  Sir, I was just curious to know whether  the\r\n\r\nCentre has addressed that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, I too share the\r\n\r\nconcerns of Assoc. Prof. Chin and my two colleagues  from\r\n\r\nthe  legal  profession, Mr Ravindran and Ms Indranee.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is timely to know what is available  from  the\r\n\r\nsurvey  and what steps can be taken to increase  the  low\r\n\r\nspirit of the legal profession, generally speaking.  Very\r\n\r\noften, I go to the bar rooms, mainly the bar room of  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts where lawyers rest for a while  before\r\n\r\ntheir  case,  and  I  can say that  the  last  2-3  years\r\n\r\nespecially, the mood is one of gloom, and I am sure it is\r\n\r\nmulti-factored.  But, realistically speaking, I think  we\r\n\r\nmust  be  very  realistic  and truthful  about  what  the\r\n\r\nproblem  is.   Surveys may give a form of  perception  of\r\n\r\nthings,  but I think the reality from the bar room  talk,\r\n\r\nat  least,  is  that the mood is just not right.   And  I\r\n\r\nthink  all  branches of the legal fraternity  got  to  be\r\n\r\ncross-examined, so to speak, and scrutinised to  see,  in\r\n\r\nreality,  what can be done.  I think the dignity  of  the\r\n\r\nlawyers,  the  self-esteem,  has  been  affected   fairly\r\n\r\nadversely,  and  I  think it will take  quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nchanges  before  they come back into the profession  with\r\n\r\nsome  form  of satisfaction and happiness.  As  indicated\r\n\r\nalso,  perhaps  there are better options available  these\r\n\r\ndays,  but I think what is important is to look at things\r\n\r\nvery  critically and even cynically to find  out  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat   is  wrong,  so  that  lawyers  an  have  a  better\r\n\r\nprofession in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Rajah, can you go on to your next\r\n\r\ntopic?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah:</b> Sir, the question I would like to\r\n\r\nask the Minister is on arbitration services and Singapore\r\n\r\nas an arbitration hub.  The question is what steps is the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Law  taking to promote this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, recently, been talking a lot about\r\n\r\nregearing the economy.  One of our strategies is to  move\r\n\r\naway  from  low-end  services and to move  up  the  value\r\n\r\nchain,  and that is to provide high value added services.\r\n\r\nArbitration  service is a particularly  good  example  of\r\n\r\nwhere  we can develop services in this area.  Arbitration\r\n\r\nis  different from litigation in that it allows  you  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  choose your venue, your panel  and  your\r\n\r\nrules.   It is particularly suited to commercial disputes\r\n\r\nand has the advantage of confidentiality.  As such, it is\r\n\r\na   form  of  alternative  dispute  resolution  which  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  important  for  foreign  investors  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional seats of arbitration have been New\r\n\r\nYork,  London,  Paris, Geneva, and in  the  region,  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  and  then with the SIAC having been  set  up  some\r\n\r\nyears  ago in Singapore.  But what Tanjong Pelepas is  to\r\n\r\nPSA,  we,  Singapore,  are to the  traditional  seats  of\r\n\r\narbitration,   because   we   can   provide   very   good\r\n\r\nprofessional  services  at a  much  lower  cost  than  is\r\n\r\nprovided  by  many of the international  law  firms.   So\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  suited in terms of being a  neutral  venue\r\n\r\nbecause  if  somebody  invests in  another  country,  the\r\n\r\ninvestor does not want to arbitrate there and the  person\r\n\r\nin  that  country  does  not want  to  arbitrate  in  the\r\n\r\ninvestor's  country.   We  are  neutral.   We  have  good\r\n\r\njurisprudence and we are low cost.  So the  question  is:\r\n\r\nwhat  are  we  doing in order to take advantage  of  this\r\n\r\nopportunity which has presented itself to us?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Encik Yatiman Yusof is not here.

The Singapore Mediation  Centre  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  under the Singapore Academy of Law  has,  over\r\n\r\nthe years, done\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquite  substantial work in trying to get mediators to  do\r\n\r\nservice  as a form of alternative dispute resolution.   I\r\n\r\nalso  believe that the Ministry of Law has done  quite  a\r\n\r\nbit, and I think this is very good for the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days, we had the penghulus amongst the\r\n\r\nMalay/Muslim group; the Chinese clan associations to help\r\n\r\ndisputes amongst Chinese people; and the panchaya amongst\r\n\r\nthe  Indians.   I think we have seen the modern  form  of\r\n\r\nthese  transforming into modern mediation.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister  for Law  whether  there  are  any\r\n\r\nenhancing  techniques being adopted now or  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture  to  increase the alternative dispute  resolution,\r\n\r\nbesides  arbitration  and,  of  course,  as  compared  to\r\n\r\nlitigation in the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Assoc. Prof. Chin, you can take your\r\n\r\ntwo cuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I have never liked\r\n\r\nthe slogan \"Singapore is a fine city\".  And I have always\r\n\r\ntaken an instant dislike to anybody I see wearing the  T-shirt  saying that \"Singapore is a fine city\", suggesting\r\n\r\nthat we criminalise even minor deviant behaviour.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  a fine thing to say about us, and it is time we  did\r\n\r\nsomething about this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many parts of this world, decriminalisation\r\n\r\ndebate  is  taking place.  In the more liberal countries,\r\n\r\nthey  are  even talking about decriminalising  drugs  and\r\n\r\nprostitution.   The  argument, essentially,  is  that  by\r\n\r\ndecriminalising certain offences, control is easier,  and\r\n\r\nother objectives such as social education can be met.  By\r\n\r\nnot  decriminalising, paradoxically, it is the  criminals\r\n\r\nwho  benefit.   For instance, by not decriminalising  the\r\n\r\nselling of drugs, only criminals would dare to sell them.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, of course, I do not mean to suggest that we\r\n\r\nwould  talk about decriminalising offences of this  type.\r\n\r\nBut  there  is  a case for decriminalisation  of  certain\r\n\r\ntypes  of  offences, particularly what I call  victimless\r\n\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a couple of years ago in this House, I argued\r\n\r\nthat ERP defaulters should not be subject to the criminal\r\n\r\nlaw, and that they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould just pay an administrative charge and the entrance\r\n\r\nfee.  I am sure that this measure, which was implemented,\r\n\r\nhas worked well.  Defaulters no longer have the stigma of\r\n\r\ncommitting  a crime every time they forgot to  put  in  a\r\n\r\ncash card when they enter the ERP.  I think it is time to\r\n\r\nthink of decriminalising more offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this process of decriminalisation is important\r\n\r\nbecause,  quite  honestly, our courts are  over  burdened\r\n\r\nwith hundreds of thousands of prosecutions for regulatory\r\n\r\noffences.     Many    of    these    prosecutions     are\r\n\r\nstraightforward.   Offenders usually  plead  guilty,  but\r\n\r\nthey  waste  valuable court time, increase  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining the legal system and, quite simply, result in\r\n\r\nmany people being treated as criminals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that there are many regulatory\r\n\r\noffences  that could be decriminalised.  Parking offences\r\n\r\nis  one  category, where the recovery of penalty  charges\r\n\r\ncould just be civil offences, and can be taken up by Town\r\n\r\nCouncils and, indeed, some of them are taken up  by  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  but  in  a prosecutorial criminal  way  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment, but they could be taken up by Town Councils in  a\r\n\r\ncivil  way  and  can  even be claimed from  Small  Claims\r\n\r\nTribunals.  Other offences, such as littering, by which I\r\n\r\ndo  not mean the killer litter cases but basic littering,\r\n\r\nthrowing  of the cigarette butt or whatever,  such  minor\r\n\r\noffences, I think, should be decriminalised, because  the\r\n\r\nobject  here is not to punish an offender with a criminal\r\n\r\nsanction  but  rather  to  persuade  him  to  be  a  more\r\n\r\nresponsible citizen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world, there are many other areas that\r\n\r\ndecriminalisation  had been looked at  in  the  cases  of\r\n\r\ndomestic  violence,  neighbour disputes,  some  forms  of\r\n\r\npublic  nuisance, vagrancy and the like.   Sir,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the  Minister  whether  his  Ministry  has\r\n\r\ninitiated this process of decriminalisation.  And, if so,\r\n\r\nhow  far  has it gone?  Can we expect to see some results\r\n\r\nwithin this year?\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance, in his Budget\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStatement,   talked  about  new  areas  of   growth   for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  high  value-added areas, and  mentioned  that\r\n\r\ninvestors  in  such areas do not look  for  the  cheapest\r\n\r\nlocation,  but  for  the country where  the  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  enjoys  the  best  protection  and  where   the\r\n\r\nenvironment  is  most conducive for the creation  of  new\r\n\r\nintellectual property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he added that this is an area where we enjoy a\r\n\r\nsignificant  advantage over our regional competitors  and\r\n\r\nthat we must build on this league.  He mentioned that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Law is conducting a comprehensive review  of\r\n\r\nour  current IP laws to support the growth of  these  new\r\n\r\nindustries  and to strengthen further IP  protection.   I\r\n\r\nhave several issues to raise on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to ask the Minister how far has\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry gone in this exercise of reviewing IP laws.\r\n\r\nThe  issues  raised by the digital age are  actually  not\r\n\r\njust   for  lawyers  alone.   Scientists,  technologists,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen and lawyers in these new industries  have  to\r\n\r\nget  together to formulate policies and rules.  Has  this\r\n\r\nbeen  done?   Or has the reform of IP laws been  seen  as\r\n\r\npurely a lawyer's exercise?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there must be recognition that\r\n\r\nintellectual property regimes should not be  the  end-all\r\n\r\nof  the task of encouraging and reinforcing our IP  laws.\r\n\r\nIn  this area, there is a need to look at issues relating\r\n\r\nto  contract, crime, communication policy, piracy  policy\r\n\r\nand  even constitutional issues.  The whole legal  system\r\n\r\nmust  respond to and be affected by these new  integrated\r\n\r\nmulti-dimensional policies.  So I hope that the review of\r\n\r\nthe  IP  law  will  not  be centred  only  on  issues  of\r\n\r\nintellectual policies but also the wider issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I have just spoken about the need to keep\r\n\r\nour young lawyers and for the legal profession to retrain\r\n\r\nand  renew  itself.  We need young lawyers in this  area.\r\n\r\nLawyers who are more Internet-savvy are more inclined  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  new industry than their seniors.   Legal\r\n\r\ninstitutions also need to be more plugged into the  other\r\n\r\nresearch centres of this world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the Max Planck Institute for  Intellectual\r\n\r\nProperty   in  Germany  is  an  outstanding  example   of\r\n\r\nexcellent  research being done.  There must  also  be,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  special arrangements made to tempt or to persuade\r\n\r\ntop  US, English, or Australian IP law firms to come  and\r\n\r\nset  up  practices  in Singapore, perhaps  together  with\r\n\r\nlocal  law firms.  I say this because, I think,  although\r\n\r\nwe  have  just started the IP Academy, it will  be  quite\r\n\r\nsome  time  before we can develop a critical mass  of  IP\r\n\r\nlawyers  that would be sufficient for the task  in  hand.\r\n\r\nSo  I do hope that the Minister will give some thought as\r\n\r\nto  how we can encourage better and more well-established\r\n\r\nlaw firms in intellectual property to come to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nthank  Members  who have spoken on the legal  profession,\r\n\r\narbitration,  decriminalisation,  information  technology\r\n\r\nand IP laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on legal profession. Let me respond to the\r\n\r\ncomments  by Prof. Chin, Mr Ravindran, Ms Indranee  Rajah\r\n\r\nand  Mr Chandra Mohan Nair.  I will start off by agreeing\r\n\r\nwith  Prof.  Chin when he said that the legal  profession\r\n\r\nplays  a  very  important role in the overall  scheme  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's competitiveness.  I think gone are  the  days\r\n\r\nwhen  we  view  the  legal profession as  a  very  narrow\r\n\r\nprofession of merely settling disputes and litigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sound legal profession which can help Singapore in\r\n\r\nour  quest  for competitiveness, which will  bring  about\r\n\r\nconfidence in the legal infrastructure and the settlement\r\n\r\nof  disputes  is  a plus for us in our  efforts  to  make\r\n\r\nourselves competitive.  So it is in that context that  we\r\n\r\nview  the  legal profession.  And in reviewing the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession,  I noted what several Members just  now  said\r\n\r\nabout   their  concerns  about  the  mood  of  the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that we should not be overly despondent.\r\n\r\nIt  is not just the legal profession whose mood has  been\r\n\r\naffected, given the downturn in the economy in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecent years.  We should be surprised if it was the legal\r\n\r\nsector  alone  which  is  brimming  with  confidence  and\r\n\r\nhappiness.   There is the perspective in  which  to  view\r\n\r\nthis matter.  The legal profession is going through, what\r\n\r\nI  would  call, a period of transition and restructuring.\r\n\r\nThere  have been many changes which have taken place  and\r\n\r\nwhich they have to adapt.  And it is this adaptation that\r\n\r\nwe  are seeing now, the changes such as that of the scale\r\n\r\nfees and conveyancing, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I also do not think that we should be wringing\r\n\r\nour  hands  over  the fact that some of the  lawyers  are\r\n\r\nleaving  the  profession.  Yes, we have to  monitor  this\r\n\r\ncarefully and closely, and to see whether it is a  matter\r\n\r\nof  serious concern.  But I tend to share the view of  Ms\r\n\r\nIndranee  Rajah that there are many reasons why this  may\r\n\r\nhappen.   And it is not wholly unexpected to see  lawyers\r\n\r\nleaving the profession.  And I think it is the reflection\r\n\r\nof  the  changing legal practice environment and a rather\r\n\r\nmobile labour market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that last year, in the Committee\r\n\r\nof  Supply,  when this topic was also mentioned,  I  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  should first understand the underlying  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  lawyers were leaving, and that was one of  the  main\r\n\r\nreasons   why  my  Ministry  worked  together  with   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Statistics  to  conduct  the  first  ever\r\n\r\ncomprehensive survey of the legal services  industry  and\r\n\r\nprofession.  This census, which has just been  completed,\r\n\r\nhas in fact shown that there are a variety of reasons why\r\n\r\nlawyers  were  leaving the practice - some  were  unhappy\r\n\r\nabout long working hours, heavy workload, some felt  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  inadequate compensation and  others  left  to\r\n\r\npursue their own interest or career.  But then, I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  these  reasons are something unique  just  to  the\r\n\r\nlegal  profession.  In fact, we are living in  a  society\r\n\r\nnow where the younger generation consider themselves more\r\n\r\nmobile and there are more choices open to them than would\r\n\r\nhave  been the case 25 or 30 years ago.   So I would  not\r\n\r\nconsider the situation as one where we would have to ring\r\n\r\nthe alarm bells just yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey revealed that slightly more than half of\r\n\r\nthose  who  left chose to work in law-related  positions,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  in-house  legal counsel,  lawyers  in  offshore\r\n\r\nfirms,  or  even in overseas practice.  So, in  a  sense,\r\n\r\nthey  have not left the legal sector as such.   They  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  in  private  practice,  or  they  may  not  have\r\n\r\npractitioners' certificates, but they have not completely\r\n\r\nleft the legal sector.  And I do not think the investment\r\n\r\nin their training and education has been lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you may ask: \"What about those who have left\r\n\r\nthe  legal  sector?\"  Prof. Chin may recall in  the  late\r\n\r\n70s, he and I were tasked by the then Vice-Chancellor, Dr\r\n\r\nTony  Tan, to visit some countries to explore why was  it\r\n\r\nin  other  jurisdictions you have a fair share  of  legal\r\n\r\nminds  in  the  non-legal sector - public administration,\r\n\r\nbusiness,  and  elsewhere in the private sector.   So  we\r\n\r\nembarked on that study.  At that time, nearly all the law\r\n\r\ngraduates in Singapore ended up in law practice.  Now, if\r\n\r\nsome  of  our  legal minds are working in public  sector,\r\n\r\nstatutory boards, business sector, is that necessarily  a\r\n\r\nbad  thing?  I do not think so.  But there must be a core\r\n\r\nof  talented, good legal minds among the senior  lawyers,\r\n\r\namong  the  younger  lawyers,  in  the  practising  legal\r\n\r\nprofession, and that I agree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, while we do not ring the alarm bells, we\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to monitor this attrition rate,  to  make\r\n\r\nsure that it is not a matter of serious concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for enthusing the younger lawyers, a point which\r\n\r\nProf. Chin made, I know that the Law Society does have in\r\n\r\nplace special schemes and counselling schemes, as well as\r\n\r\nsocial and welfare activities, to help young lawyers cope\r\n\r\nwith  stress and other concerns that they have.  In fact,\r\n\r\nthe Law Society should be commended for having started an\r\n\r\noutreach programme to allow young lawyers to share  their\r\n\r\nexperiences   and  strengthen  camaraderie   within   the\r\n\r\nprofession.   I  think  it is important  for  the  senior\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Bar to spend some time to interact  with\r\n\r\nthe younger members of the Bar, imbibe in them the values\r\n\r\nand  aspirations of the legal profession, share with them\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexperiences. And I think this is one of the  reasons  why\r\n\r\nthe concept of dining has been introduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have asked about the census which was\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  the  Ministry of Law, together  with  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Statistics.  And one of  the  reasons  we\r\n\r\ndecided  to  embark on the survey was because there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  so  many anecdotal reports that this is the problem\r\n\r\nof  the  Law Society, or the legal profession, that  many\r\n\r\nlawyers are leaving for this reason or that reason and we\r\n\r\ndecided we better have an empirical survey done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that the survey has been concluded,\r\n\r\nand it is published and will be available for sale to the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public.  Let me say that several  findings  from\r\n\r\nthe  survey  are  as  follows:   First,  the  survey  was\r\n\r\ntargeted  at local law firms, lawyers and ex-lawyers  who\r\n\r\nhave   left  the  profession.   There  was  an  excellent\r\n\r\nresponse rate.  99% for law firms' response rate, 75% for\r\n\r\nlawyers and 38% for lawyers who left the practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do these findings show us? First, the findings\r\n\r\nreflect  a  legal  service industry which  is  undergoing\r\n\r\nconsolidation  and restructuring.  And the  survey  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the  legal profession is grappling with  challenges\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by increasing competition while,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, trying to maintain professional standards  and\r\n\r\nservice quality.  Larger law firms clearly, and it is not\r\n\r\nsurprising,  were more profitable and have better  growth\r\n\r\nprospects  than smaller firms.  They have higher  revenue\r\n\r\nper  lawyer, higher profits per partner.  Operating costs\r\n\r\nof  large law firms are, on an average, only one-third of\r\n\r\nthose small firms on a per revenue basis.  Our law firms,\r\n\r\nthe census showed, were aware of the benefits that can be\r\n\r\nreaped from exploiting the economies of scale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey also showed that the law firms expect\r\n\r\nrevenue  from litigation and conveyancing to continue  to\r\n\r\nstagnate  and  even  shrink.  However, general  corporate\r\n\r\nwork  in  new  areas,  like  intellectual  property   and\r\n\r\ninfocomm  technology law, as Prof. Chin has pointed  out,\r\n\r\nare areas where there is tremendous potential for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth  in the coming years.  I think Prof. Chin is  also\r\n\r\nright to say that for lawyers to stay relevant, they have\r\n\r\nto  upgrade their skills and move in the new growth areas\r\n\r\nof  practice.  On this, the census showed that there were\r\n\r\n168   lawyers   currently  specialising  in  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  and  infocomm  technology  law,  and  77  firms\r\n\r\nindicated that they have serious plans to expand the  ICT\r\n\r\npractice  whilst  122  firms indicated  likewise  for  IP\r\n\r\npractice.   So if we take these findings, I am encouraged\r\n\r\nthat there is a growing awareness of the law firms of the\r\n\r\nareas in which they should move into.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law firms also, I am glad to say, reported a\r\n\r\npositive  interest  in  taking on  regional  as  well  as\r\n\r\ninternational cases with cross-border transactions.  Many\r\n\r\nlaw  firms  were  also  keen to enter  overseas  markets,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  ASEAN and China.  This  regionalisation\r\n\r\nand globalisation of legal practice is a step, of course,\r\n\r\nin the right direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Government is concerned, we will be\r\n\r\nsupportive   of  these  endeavours,  and   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board has been tasked to be the lead  agency\r\n\r\nto  promote legal services, and IE Singapore has in  fact\r\n\r\nbeen  helping local law firms to establish their presence\r\n\r\nin  overseas  markets.  So, I would say  that  these  are\r\n\r\nsigns  that law firms and lawyers are gearing up to  meet\r\n\r\nthe challenges.  I am encouraged that 118 firms indicated\r\n\r\nthat they are planning to merge, including four large and\r\n\r\n13 medium-size firms, and 59 firms intended to form joint\r\n\r\nlaw    ventures   or   law   alliances.    Several   sole\r\n\r\nproprietorships  indicated plans to cease  practice,  and\r\n\r\nlawyers  who  had  been  in conveyancing  reported  their\r\n\r\nintention  to  practise in other areas of  law,  such  as\r\n\r\ncorporate law or quit practice altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving his cut on the last item, Prof. Chin also\r\n\r\nemphasised the need for the legal profession to be  savvy\r\n\r\nwith  IP law and IT, and I agree with him that the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession has to continue to improve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nitself  by  upgrading skills in these areas.  I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore Academy of Law and the  Law  Society\r\n\r\nhave  played  an  important role  in  this  by  providing\r\n\r\ncontinuing  legal  education to lawyers  through  various\r\n\r\nseminars,  workshops  and  conferences.   In  fact,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Academy of Law has organised seminars  touching\r\n\r\non  these new areas, ie, IP law, technology law, as  well\r\n\r\nas  biotechnology and life sciences.  So, the way  to  go\r\n\r\nforward is for the Ministry of Law, together with the Law\r\n\r\nSociety  and the other key agencies like the  Faculty  of\r\n\r\nLaw  and the Academy of Law, to evaluate the findings  of\r\n\r\nthe  census  and  to  see what are the  implications  and\r\n\r\nfollow-up  actions needed as a result of the findings  of\r\n\r\nthis survey.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to arbitration, I thank Ms Indranee Rajah\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Chandra Mohan for what they have said.  I  fully\r\n\r\nagree  with Ms Indranee Rajah on her comments  about  the\r\n\r\nscope  for Singapore to develop into an arbitration  hub.\r\n\r\nI also agree with her that there are many advantages that\r\n\r\nSingapore has which we can exploit in this regard.  It is\r\n\r\na competitive area, and we have to gear ourselves to make\r\n\r\nourselves  a  centre for international  arbitration.   On\r\n\r\nthis, there have been considerable discussions over  this\r\n\r\npast  year,  notably in the Legal Services Working  Group\r\n\r\nwhich  was  a group that reported to the Economic  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee,  and I am glad that Ms Indranee  Rajah  was  a\r\n\r\nmember of this and made notable contributions.  It was co-chaired  by  Mr  Shanmugam and the Solicitor-General,  Mr\r\n\r\nChan Seng Onn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Legal Services Working Group recommended that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  be promoted as an Alternative  Dispute\r\n\r\nResolution   (ADR)  services  centre  for   the   region,\r\n\r\nespecially  in international arbitration.  It recommended\r\n\r\na 4-pronged strategy:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Create a Singapore brand of ADR;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Active marketing and promotion of arbitration\r\n\r\nservices;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Government support and funding; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Encourage other leading ADR institutions to set\r\n\r\nup sub-centres in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that the Government has accepted\r\n\r\nthese recommendations, and we are fully committed to work\r\n\r\nwith   other  agencies  to  establish  Singapore  as   an\r\n\r\ninternational  arbitration  centre  of  choice  in   this\r\n\r\nregion.  Clearly, to succeed in our endeavours, it cannot\r\n\r\njust  be a Government effort or a Ministry of Law effort.\r\n\r\nA  total Singapore Inc approach is needed.  It needs  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the private sector, the legal profession,  the\r\n\r\narbitral  fraternity,  the  business  community  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there  is  a central role to be  played  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).  If we\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  our efforts, Singapore will  stand  to  reap\r\n\r\nsignificant  economic  benefits arising  from  a  greater\r\n\r\ndemand  for  domestic  legal  services,  and  there   are\r\n\r\ntremendous indirect economic spin-offs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Ms Indranee Rajah said, we have many advantages.\r\n\r\nOur  reputation  for  neutrality  and  impartiality,  our\r\n\r\ngeographic location, our easy accessibility, we have  top\r\n\r\nquality  judicial and legal expertise, and we have  other\r\n\r\nadvantages like cost and people who are conversant in the\r\n\r\nEnglish language.  Last year, we made amendments  to  our\r\n\r\nlegal  provisions to exempt from income tax income earned\r\n\r\nby  foreign arbitrators for arbitration work performed in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  will  enhance  our  attractiveness  to\r\n\r\nforeign  arbitrators hearing cases here.  So,  we  should\r\n\r\ncapitalise  on these strengths and intensify our  efforts\r\n\r\nto promote the Singapore International Arbitration Centre\r\n\r\n(SIAC).   In  all  these,  the  SIAC  will  be  the   key\r\n\r\ninstitution  to champion this cause.  The SIAC  has  made\r\n\r\nvery good progress, and I am aware that the SIAC plans to\r\n\r\nachieve  more.   It  is  gearing  itself  to  meet   this\r\n\r\nchallenge,  and  to  position  itself  to  be   the   key\r\n\r\narbitration institution in the region.  And I  know  that\r\n\r\nthe   SIAC  is  actively  discussing  with  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity,  including the Singapore Business  Federation,\r\n\r\nso as to involve the business community in a way that can\r\n\r\nenhance the linking up of legal and commercial expertise,\r\n\r\nand to better pro-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmote and market Singapore's arbitration services abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these moves, I think Singapore will be well\r\n\r\npositioned for future growth and expansion and  build  on\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  already achieved today.  As  far  as  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Law is concerned, it will play a facilitator\r\n\r\nrole  to  ensure that the arbitration legislation remains\r\n\r\nprogressive  and relevant, and encourage the building  up\r\n\r\nof  local  arbitration expertise.  We will  also  provide\r\n\r\nsome  funding for promotion and marketing of  arbitration\r\n\r\nservices in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the champion agency, it is the EDB which\r\n\r\nhas  been  appointed as the champion agency to drive  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the legal services industry.  I know  that\r\n\r\nthe  EDB is committed to help SIAC, ICC and other players\r\n\r\nto  promote the arbitration business in Singapore as well\r\n\r\nas   to   develop  the  infrastructure  and  capabilities\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  succeed.  The Ministry of  Law  will  work\r\n\r\nclosely with the EDB towards this end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan made the general point that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should facilitate and assist in greater use of\r\n\r\nADR  and not just arbitration but also mediation.  As  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  heard my colleague, the Senior  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for Law, earlier on when he replied on other cuts,\r\n\r\nhe  would know that the Ministry of Law would continue to\r\n\r\ndevelop  community  mediation centres (CMCs)  even  more.\r\n\r\nThey   have   proved  successful  and,  as   they   prove\r\n\r\nsuccessful, we will improve on them and, where  resources\r\n\r\nand  facilities are conducive, we will consider expanding\r\n\r\nthe CMCs.  But, clearly, the Government is committed as a\r\n\r\nmatter   of  policy  to  developing  alternative  dispute\r\n\r\nresolution  and,  under  ADR, we have  arbitration,  both\r\n\r\ndomestic   and   international,  as  well  as   community\r\n\r\nmediation.  We will explore whether the present regime of\r\n\r\nmediation,  which  is  now limited to  certain  kinds  of\r\n\r\ndisputes, can slowly be expanded to other areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Prof. Chin asked about decriminalising, and\r\n\r\nwhether  this  is an area that we can go into.   He  will\r\n\r\nrecall that last year\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProf.  Ho  Peng Kee had informed the House that the  AG's\r\n\r\nChambers  was  in fact going to study and assess  whether\r\n\r\ncertain minor criminal offences could be reclassified  as\r\n\r\nnon-criminal  infringements, and to consider  whether  we\r\n\r\ncan use administrative and civil sanctions as enforcement\r\n\r\nmechanisms   instead  of  criminal  enforcement   through\r\n\r\ncriminal  sanctions.   I am happy to  announce  that  the\r\n\r\nstudy has been completed and a review has been done.  The\r\n\r\nconclusion  is  that there is merit in promoting  greater\r\n\r\nuse   of   non-criminal  sanctions  for  some  regulatory\r\n\r\noffences.   But  I would caution that we  are  proceeding\r\n\r\nstep  by  step.  I do not think he can expect  that  this\r\n\r\nwill  move  in the way that some European countries  have\r\n\r\ngone to decriminalise drugs, for example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a large number of regulatory offences are\r\n\r\nprosecuted by Government departments and statutory boards\r\n\r\nwhich carry convictions.  The criminal process is not the\r\n\r\nonly  possible approach, and I agree with Prof. Chin that\r\n\r\nto  secure  compliance with the regulatory  requirements,\r\n\r\nthere  can  be a whole range of administrative  sanctions\r\n\r\nwhich can be used.  But we have to consider whether it is\r\n\r\nappropriate or not in particular situations.  And I think\r\n\r\nwe  can  do  so.   We can have greater recourse  to  non-criminal  sanctions without compromising our tough  stand\r\n\r\non maintaining law and order.  Therefore, we need to have\r\n\r\na differentiated approach.  A differentiated approach may\r\n\r\nbe  warranted  in  some  cases  where  a  breach  of  the\r\n\r\nregulation does not, for example, attract the stigma  and\r\n\r\ndisqualifications  which  are  associated  with  criminal\r\n\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we will work with regulatory agencies so as to\r\n\r\nencourage  them  to adopt a responsive approach  using  a\r\n\r\ncalibrated  range of sanctions.  This range of  sanctions\r\n\r\ncan   be  from  administrative  actions  which  encourage\r\n\r\ncompliance,  to more severe administrative  actions,  for\r\n\r\nexample,   suspension  or  revocation  of  licence   and,\r\n\r\nfinally, to punitive civil penalties, and so on.   If  we\r\n\r\nhave this differentiated approach of criminal and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-criminal  sanctions, it will project Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\npro-business  regulator while upholding the integrity  of\r\n\r\nour  market.  This is in fact the approach taken by  some\r\n\r\ncountries,  such  as  the  US,  UK  and  Australia.    In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there are already some items  of  legislation\r\n\r\nthat provide for non-criminal sanctions.  Prof. Chin gave\r\n\r\nan  example  which he can rightfully take credit.   Other\r\n\r\nexamples  are in the more recent Telecommunications  Act,\r\n\r\nand Securities and Futures Act.  More can be done.  But I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should be slow to criminalise errant behaviour\r\n\r\nwhich  carries  no moral turpitude but a more  regulatory\r\n\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when we embark on this exercise, we will be\r\n\r\nguided  by several considerations.  For example, we  will\r\n\r\nlook  at  rules which have outlived their  purposes.   We\r\n\r\nwill look at rules that may be breached without any moral\r\n\r\nturpitude on the part of the offender.  Good examples are\r\n\r\nfailing  to obtain approval for certain kinds of actions.\r\n\r\nA  classic  example  that my officials  came  across  was\r\n\r\nfailure  to obtain approval for the type and  size  of  a\r\n\r\ntombstone  or failure to display a licence at a prominent\r\n\r\nplace.  I think these are classic examples where they may\r\n\r\nbe  offences, but we may not necessarily want to  attract\r\n\r\ncriminal sanctions for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that is an area where we have studied, and my\r\n\r\nMinistry, together with the AG's Chambers, will work with\r\n\r\nother  agencies  and regulatory agencies  to  review  the\r\n\r\nlegislation in the light of that policy approach.  It may\r\n\r\ntake some time, but I cannot promise Prof. Chin that  the\r\n\r\nlegislation  will  be ready this year.   It  is  not  one\r\n\r\nomnibus  legislation that we are working  on.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nwhole  host  of  regulations, subsidiary legislation  and\r\n\r\nActs  of Parliament which we will have to look into,  and\r\n\r\nwe  will  do  it  in  an  ad-hoc way,  as  and  when  the\r\n\r\nMinistries are reviewing it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the point made by Prof. Chin on\r\n\r\nintellectual  property,  I  fully  agree  with  him  that\r\n\r\nintellectual  property  is  critical  for  our   economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.   I  also agree with him that in our  efforts  to\r\n\r\nensure our laws and policies on intellectual property are\r\n\r\nup to speed, this is not an exercise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvolving just one Ministry.  It cannot be so.  It has to\r\n\r\ninvolve  all  the  Ministries.  It  has  to  involve  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector and statutory boards because it  involves\r\n\r\nlaw   and  policy.   It  also  involves  study   of   the\r\n\r\nexperiences of other countries.  So I agree with him when\r\n\r\nhe   highlighted  IP  as  an  important  factor  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore   attractive  as  a  business  and   investment\r\n\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked how MinLaw is proceeding about this.\r\n\r\nWe have taken the approach that he has advocated. We have\r\n\r\ninteracted  with many players who need to come  into  the\r\n\r\npicture - not just research scientists and engineers  and\r\n\r\nother   inventors   but  also  businessmen,   financiers,\r\n\r\nlawyers,  judges,  institutions of higher  learning.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, we have not taken the approach that  IP  is\r\n\r\njust  a  matter  for  lawyers or for the  legal  services\r\n\r\nalone. We have to involve the business sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first role is to put in place the underlying\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and to ensure that there is a  high  level\r\n\r\nof IP awareness.  For that objective, we have worked very\r\n\r\nclosely  with  MTI,  MITA and other  agencies  like  EDB,\r\n\r\nA*STAR,  SPRING, IE Singapore, IDA and so on.   Now,  how\r\n\r\nare  we  going  about  it?  In the  past  18  months,  in\r\n\r\naddition  to dialogues with our public sector colleagues,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Law officials have had rather  in-depth\r\n\r\nconsultations  with  more  than  200  representatives  of\r\n\r\nbusiness, legal and educational communities to understand\r\n\r\ntheir  perspective  and  to  get  their  input  on   what\r\n\r\nSingapore needs and how best we can proceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of all these dialogues, we have\r\n\r\nidentified an important gap, ie, a relatively  low  level\r\n\r\nof  awareness amongst our inventors and entrepreneurs  on\r\n\r\nwhat  IP  is  and how to manage it.  Therefore,  we  have\r\n\r\nfound  that  we  need  to develop a pool  of  skilled  IP\r\n\r\nprofessionals and IP-savvy businessmen in Singapore,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is quite urgent.  Our businessmen need to know what\r\n\r\nIP they own, how to protect it and how to exploit it.  In\r\n\r\norder to meet this need, we have established\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe IP Academy in January this year.  It will cater to  a\r\n\r\nwide   range   of  audiences,  offering  programmes   for\r\n\r\nresearchers,  professionals and businessmen.   And  here,\r\n\r\nthe  point  that Prof. Chin mentioned, that we must  also\r\n\r\nestablish  linkages with renowned institutions in  Europe\r\n\r\nand  elsewhere is well taken and is a point that  the  IP\r\n\r\nAcademy is no doubt already addressing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that we are fully supportive of\r\n\r\nthe  points  made  by  Prof. Chin and  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\ninformation  that  I have given will make  him  confident\r\n\r\nthat my Ministry and other agencies of the Government are\r\n\r\nproceeding energetically in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, I would like to propose that\r\n\r\nan urgent review of the ceiling for means-testing used by\r\n\r\nthe  Legal  Aid  Bureau be initiated.  The review  should\r\n\r\nlook towards raising the ceiling so that more individuals\r\n\r\nwho need legal aid can gain access to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current ceilings for an individual's disposable\r\n\r\nincome of not more than $10,000 and disposable capital of\r\n\r\nnot  more  than $7,000, although reviewed two years  ago,\r\n\r\nare  restrictive.  I would like to relate an example from\r\n\r\nmy  MPS.   Under the ceiling, it discriminates against  a\r\n\r\nworking   mother  earning  a  salary  of   about   $2,000\r\n\r\ncontesting for custody of a child in a divorce case.  The\r\n\r\nconditions  stipulated under the means-test need  review.\r\n\r\nIt  is becoming disconnected from the current changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  socio-economic situation of our working  population.\r\n\r\nWe  need  a  more realistic formula to measure disposable\r\n\r\nincome.  In the interest of making justice accessible  to\r\n\r\nthe low income families or individuals, we should use the\r\n\r\nmerits test, ie, based on the merits of the case, as  the\r\n\r\nprimary method to qualify for the legal aid.  The  merits\r\n\r\ntest  should then be supported by a more realistic  means\r\n\r\ntest measure to ensure deserving recipients receive legal\r\n\r\naid.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, currently, the Government\r\n\r\nprovides legal aid for civil cases through the Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nBureau, but not for most criminal cases.  The only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncriminal  cases  where the Government  pays  for  defence\r\n\r\nlawyers are when the charges attract the death penalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other criminal cases, although there is a\r\n\r\nvoluntary scheme run by the Law Society where lawyers  do\r\n\r\ncases  for  free, voluntary schemes as usual suffer  from\r\n\r\nresource limitations and possible discontinuation.  Based\r\n\r\non  the statistics of the Law Society website as at  31st\r\n\r\nMarch  2001, only 1,271 applicants - which is 20% of  the\r\n\r\ntotal 6,312 applicants - were accepted and helped by  the\r\n\r\nLaw  Society.   The fact that 80% of the  applicants  who\r\n\r\nrequested  for  help  are rejected  is  an  alarming  and\r\n\r\ndisturbing  figure.  If the Government can  fund  a  poor\r\n\r\nperson  getting a divorce through the Legal  Aid  Bureau,\r\n\r\nwhy  can  the  Government  not fund  a  person  facing  a\r\n\r\ncriminal charge who risks conviction or imprisonment?  Is\r\n\r\nthis not important?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedures for preparing and fighting a criminal\r\n\r\ncase, liaising with AG's Chambers, etc, are not easy  for\r\n\r\na lay person to handle.  If the Government is prepared to\r\n\r\nspend  some $500 million on a new Supreme Court  building\r\n\r\nwhen  we  already have two buildings housing  the  courts\r\n\r\ncurrently,  with lots of space not utilised and  millions\r\n\r\nsunk  in there to have technology courts, could the money\r\n\r\nnot be better used to help those in need of legal aid?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be argued that criminals should not be given\r\n\r\nsuch  assistance as they have committed a  crime  against\r\n\r\nthe public.  But their rights to a fair representation in\r\n\r\na  trial  should  be considered.  They are disadvantaged,\r\n\r\nunder  our  judicial system, without a trained person  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  them. For those who are not so educated,  even\r\n\r\nin  the event of pleading, they may not even know how and\r\n\r\non  what grounds to plead for leniency or to negotiate  a\r\n\r\nlesser sentence with the Public Prosecutor.  Some of them\r\n\r\neven come and see me at my MPS, but I am no lawyer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chandra Mohan, you may take both\r\n\r\ncuts together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, a good legal system\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  would require access  to  justice  to  our\r\n\r\npeople, both in civil and criminal matters, promptly  and\r\n\r\nexpeditiously, and at reasonable cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we have achieved most of these. But there\r\n\r\nare  poor people in Singapore.  Very often, they get into\r\n\r\nlegal  problems and usually and, unfortunately, the lower\r\n\r\nsector   do  get  into  bigger  legal  problems,   mainly\r\n\r\nmatrimonial problems, traffic accidents, and probate  and\r\n\r\ncriminal matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Legal Aid and Advice Act which caters\r\n\r\nmainly  to  civil  but not criminal matters, because  the\r\n\r\ncriminal aspect of it was repealed a few years ago.  What\r\n\r\nis  the means-test today?  As indicated earlier, there is\r\n\r\nroom  for  improvement on this so that the net  could  be\r\n\r\nspread  wider to a larger section of the poorer community\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst there is criminal legal aid with the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  the  Law Society of Singapore  under  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Legal Aid Scheme, and the State  providing  for\r\n\r\ncriminal  legal  aid  for capital punishment  cases,  ie,\r\n\r\ndeath sentence and life imprisonment, perhaps this aspect\r\n\r\nof  it,  although  the Ministry of Law may  not  wish  to\r\n\r\npursue  it  for the reasons mentioned, ie, the  State  is\r\n\r\nprosecuting, perhaps more financial assistance  could  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  organisations that are carrying out a criminal\r\n\r\nlegal  aid  scheme,  especially  the  Law  Society,   and\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance be channelled into  that,  so  that\r\n\r\nmore  people will have access to lawyers to handle  their\r\n\r\ncriminal matters.  I trust that the Ministry of Law would\r\n\r\ntake  positive  measures to help those  who  really  need\r\n\r\nlegal aid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of privatisation of the justice system,\r\n\r\nwe  have  a  respectable  legal  and  justice  system  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The administration of the justice  system  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is respected by many, not just in Singapore but\r\n\r\nalso  in the ASEAN countries and the world at large.   We\r\n\r\nshould perhaps capitalise on this and try and provide for\r\n\r\nalternative  or  additional dispute  resolution  and  the\r\n\r\njustice system in a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway  to  make it viable for litigants from other  nations\r\n\r\ntoo  to look to our justice system to try and get justice\r\n\r\nin Singapore by consenting parties who are litigating but\r\n\r\nwho may not be Singaporeans.  If we are able to privatise\r\n\r\nthat  justice system, it could be an area that the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession  could benefit from and the name of  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a place where a good justice system is made available\r\n\r\nto  not  just  Singaporeans,  but  also  to  people  from\r\n\r\noutside.   I  would therefore urge the Ministry  to  look\r\n\r\ninto the possibility of this to enhance and expedite this\r\n\r\nso that we in Singapore can benefit from it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ravindran, you may take both cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran:</b> Sir, the law currently provides\r\n\r\nfor  mandatory minimum for some offences.  The reason for\r\n\r\nthis  is  deterrence.   However,  at  the  lower  end  of\r\n\r\nculpability, this has had the effect of treating cases of\r\n\r\ndiffering  culpability  in the same  way.   To  create  a\r\n\r\ndistinction  in sentencing between differing  cases,  the\r\n\r\nmandatory  minimum  has become the minimum  sentence  for\r\n\r\ncases with the lowest culpability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed that prosecutorial discretion in\r\n\r\nreducing  charges, etc, has been applied less  frequently\r\n\r\nnowadays.  Some charges, with mandatory minimum, such  as\r\n\r\nharbouring  immigration offenders, cannot be  reduced  as\r\n\r\nthere is no available lesser charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a corollary to this, the courts use the mandatory\r\n\r\nminimum as the starting point of sentencing for the least\r\n\r\nculpable  cases.  Take the case of employment of  illegal\r\n\r\nworkers  as an example.  The average \"plead guilty\"  case\r\n\r\nnow gets seven months' jail.  An accused who claims trial\r\n\r\ntypically gets 11 months' jail, an increase of more  than\r\n\r\n50% for exercising the legally given and constitutionally\r\n\r\nprotected right to claim trial, which is too high a price\r\n\r\nto pay to save the court's time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My anecdotal observation is that the combination of\r\n\r\nlegislated  minimums and tariff sentencing in the  courts\r\n\r\nhas resulted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  more people getting jail terms, and the average  jail\r\n\r\nterm  increasing  in  length.   The  four  objectives  of\r\n\r\nsentencing are rehabilitation, retribution or punishment,\r\n\r\ngeneral and specific deterrence and, finally, prevention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sentencing is a balance of the needs of society\r\n\r\nand  the  individual offender to achieve the  above  four\r\n\r\nobjectives.   I appreciate that the different  objectives\r\n\r\ncarry  different weight, depending on the facts  of  each\r\n\r\ncase.   Mandatory  minimum and rigid  sentencing  tariffs\r\n\r\nmake it more difficult for the Subordinate Courts to meet\r\n\r\nthe ends of justice in individual cases.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must commend the Minister for Transport when\r\n\r\nhe recently moved the amendment to provide the punishment\r\n\r\nfor weekend car offenders from one of jail sentence which\r\n\r\nwas  being imposed by the Subordinate Courts to one where\r\n\r\nthey  provided fine for the first offender, and  only  in\r\n\r\nsubsequent cases for fine and jail to be given.   Because\r\n\r\nthey realise that the Subordinate Court was imposing jail\r\n\r\nterms  for  first-time  offenders,  which  was  not   the\r\n\r\noriginal intention of the Minister for Transport at  that\r\n\r\npoint in time when he moved the passing of the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been no holistic study of the\r\n\r\neffectiveness   of  mandatory  minimum   and   sentencing\r\n\r\ntariffs.   This must be done from the point  of  view  of\r\n\r\nlegal jurisprudence and sociological factors.  We need  a\r\n\r\ncareful  weighing of the benefits of putting people  into\r\n\r\njail against the cost of doing so in terms of expenditure\r\n\r\nand  social  costs to them, their families and Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  are  dealing  with  Singaporeans  and  must  not  let\r\n\r\noperational and administrative efficiency become the only\r\n\r\nfactors that are to be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to commend the NMP Mr Chandra\r\n\r\nMohan  for  alluding to this when he  raised  this  point\r\n\r\nunder the Criminal Justice System in taking a cut on  the\r\n\r\nJudicature.   Sir, I would like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether the sentencing policies  in  place  now\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfulfilled  their intended purposes.  What  has  been  the\r\n\r\ncollateral  cost  and whether the approach  currently  in\r\n\r\nplace can be improved?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next cut, Sir, is State Land. Sir, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Land  Authority is the manager  of  all  State\r\n\r\nlands  in Singapore.  In the past, I have spoken in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  on  the need for opening up state lands which  lie\r\n\r\nidle  for  use  by  the public for both recreational  and\r\n\r\nsports facilities.  I am glad that whenever some agencies\r\n\r\napply,  the Singapore Land Authority has been kind enough\r\n\r\nto  allow  for  the  use  of such land  for  recreational\r\n\r\npurposes.   For  example,  in  my  constituency,  when  I\r\n\r\napplied for about 20,000 square feet piece of land  which\r\n\r\nwas  lying  idle to be used for recreational use,  I  was\r\n\r\nvery happy that the SLA allowed the use of such land  for\r\n\r\nrecreational purpose.  But what I would like  to  see  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  SLA  to be more pro-active in putting  up  such\r\n\r\nlands  which are available for recreational  use  on  its\r\n\r\nInternet, and to be even more pro-active, maybe sending a\r\n\r\nlist of State land which can be used for recreational  or\r\n\r\nsports  purposes,  to  each  constituency  and  the   MPs\r\n\r\nconcerned, so that they can highlight it to the public in\r\n\r\ntheir  own constituency or even the public in general  as\r\n\r\nto  what  are  the State lands which are lying  idle  and\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be used by the public for either recreational\r\n\r\nor  sports  purposes.   Instead of  letting  public  land\r\n\r\nsitting  idle  without any alternative use for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing,  it is better that such land be used by the public\r\n\r\nfor such recreational and sports use.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, taking the\r\n\r\ncue  from  the Government's present effort to review  all\r\n\r\nrules  and regulations, I would like to urge the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law to review and amend the Land Acquisition Act  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  amount of compensation to be awarded would  be\r\n\r\npegged simply to the full market value of the property as\r\n\r\nat the time of acquisition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently compensation is based on the lower of\r\n\r\nthe  market  value  as at the date of  acquisition  or  a\r\n\r\nstipulated statutory date, the most recent of which is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1st  January 1995.

In the past, when  property\r\n\r\nprices  were rising, many affected landowners who do  not\r\n\r\nqualify  for ex-gratia payment were greatly aggrieved  as\r\n\r\nthey  were compensated a fraction of the actual value  of\r\n\r\nthe  property had it been sold in the open market at  the\r\n\r\ntime of acquisition.  This is because market value as  at\r\n\r\nthe  statutory date was much lower then.  Even  when  the\r\n\r\ncompensation is based on market value as at the  time  of\r\n\r\nacquisition, because prevailing values would generally be\r\n\r\nlower  than those at statutory date on 1st January  1995,\r\n\r\nsome   affected  owners  are  still  aggrieved   by   the\r\n\r\nrestriction  of  the compensation to  the  lower  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  use  or the permissible use.  For  instance,  I\r\n\r\nknow  of an acquired petrol station site which was  zoned\r\n\r\neither  residential or industrial in the earlier relevant\r\n\r\nMaster Plan and then rezoned to transport facility in the\r\n\r\n<br><br>1998&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Plan.  Based on the Land Acquisition Act, the\r\n\r\npetrol  station  site  will be  compensated  taking  into\r\n\r\naccount  either the residential or the industrial zoning.\r\n\r\nSuch  values could be one-third to half of the full value\r\n\r\nof the petrol station.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the conditions under which the restrictions for\r\n\r\ncompensation  were  imposed in the 1970s  are  no  longer\r\n\r\nvalid.   There was then an urgent need for the Government\r\n\r\nto  acquire  land  for urban redevelopment,  housing  and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.   Now, more than 80% of Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nhoused  in  HDB flats on land acquired by the  Government\r\n\r\nand  our transport network and infrastructure are  almost\r\n\r\nfully developed.  The rate of acquisition has slowed down\r\n\r\nsignificantly.  Moreover, some 80% or more of the land in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are owned by the Government and the  statutory\r\n\r\nboards.  The Government is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore  now  able to use its land sales  programme  to\r\n\r\nmoderate land price increases.  Also, many countries like\r\n\r\nthe UK compensate based on market value as at the date of\r\n\r\nacquisition.   Our  Act, with these restrictive  clauses,\r\n\r\nhas been called draconian by many.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge the Minister for Law to consider\r\n\r\nremoving  the  statutory date requirement altogether  and\r\n\r\nallowing  compensation to be pegged simply  to  the  full\r\n\r\nmarket  value  of  the property as at  the  date  of  the\r\n\r\nacquisition.   This will make the basis  of  compensation\r\n\r\nmore  just and much less acrimonious between the affected\r\n\r\nowners and the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I concur with\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  Amy  Khor on the appeal  for  a  review  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  amount  to the full market  value  of  land\r\n\r\nacquired under section 33 of the Land Acquisition Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a comparison to three other countries, Hong Kong,\r\n\r\nAustralia and Malaysia, within the region, only Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  the  additional  statutory date which  reflects  the\r\n\r\nhistorical    property   market   condition    for    the\r\n\r\ndetermination of the statutory compensation  besides  the\r\n\r\nmarket  value  and date of notification  or  declaration.\r\n\r\nHong Kong and Australia determine the market value of the\r\n\r\nproperty  at the date of the acquisition.  For  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nit  is  also consistent, that is, the date of acquisition\r\n\r\nor   declaration  date.   Properties  acquired  by  these\r\n\r\ngovernments   are  adequately  compensated  promptly   to\r\n\r\nreflect the market condition.  However, Singapore  has  a\r\n\r\nstatutory    date   for   determination   of    statutory\r\n\r\ncompensation  and  this resulted  in  the  amount  to  be\r\n\r\ndefinitely  below  the present market value.   To  reduce\r\n\r\nhardship  and  to  allow for lateral  movement,  the  Act\r\n\r\nintroduced the ex-gratia payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair principle of land acquisition is thus not\r\n\r\nto  cause  undue  hardship  to our  property  owners  and\r\n\r\nprovide  a  fair compensation whenever land  is  acquired\r\n\r\ncompulsorily.  If we go on this argument,  then  we  must\r\n\r\nallow  the  property  owner to  be  able  to  source  for\r\n\r\nalternative property to carry on his business or  have  a\r\n\r\nroof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover  his  head  at the time of acquisition.   Obviously,\r\n\r\nthis Act presently does not allow this to happen and many\r\n\r\na time, ex-gratia payment is made and the final statutory\r\n\r\ncompensation  is  still not sufficient  for  the  lateral\r\n\r\nalternative move by the affected property owner.  This is\r\n\r\nbecause,  with the statutory date instituted in the  Act,\r\n\r\nthe  compensation  amount is definitely  lower  than  the\r\n\r\ncurrent market value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of one particular case. The offered\r\n\r\nstatutory  compensation is only 59% of the market  value.\r\n\r\nThe  ex-gratia compensation sum is a goodwill payment and\r\n\r\nhas a maximum cap of $3 million and no appeal is allowed.\r\n\r\nFor  larger properties affected, the amount comparatively\r\n\r\nwould  be too small to help the affected property  owner.\r\n\r\nThe  Act  does  not also take into account the  ancillary\r\n\r\nexpenses  of the ownership of the property, for  example,\r\n\r\nthe  mortgage loan of the affected property.  Many of the\r\n\r\nproperty  owners are personal guarantors of the property.\r\n\r\nWith   the  forced  termination  of  ownership   by   the\r\n\r\nauthority, the bank would recall the outstanding interest\r\n\r\nof  the loan.  The property owner is liable regardless of\r\n\r\nthe fact that the property is compulsorily acquired.  The\r\n\r\nbank  would  sometime share the burden of the outstanding\r\n\r\ninterest,  but many a time property owners have  to  bear\r\n\r\nthe brunt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the statutory compensation amount below the\r\n\r\nmarket  value, the initial payment of 20% could not  even\r\n\r\nresolve  the  payment  of the outstanding  mortgage  loan\r\n\r\ninterest recalled by the bank.  The initial payment could\r\n\r\nbe   even  larger,  as  the  authority  has  already  the\r\n\r\nsafeguard  of  a  statutory compensation amount  that  is\r\n\r\nbelow  the market value.  Please expedite the process  of\r\n\r\nthe  final  compensation  amount.   The  average  process\r\n\r\nperiod, as was told earlier to me, was between 2-3 years.\r\n\r\nThis  is  definitely slow for an efficient civil service.\r\n\r\nThe  bank  could  not  wait  so  long.   The  bank  would\r\n\r\nimmediately  move  in  to recover  the  outstanding  loan\r\n\r\ninterest and this gap of time would cause hardship to the\r\n\r\naffected owner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Government valuers be also\r\n\r\nincluded in the civil service\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeeting  with the private sector, as suggested by  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minster Lee, as valuation is a universal art taught\r\n\r\nunder  the  basic  valuation  principle.   But  when  one\r\n\r\npractises art in isolation from each other, the final art\r\n\r\nform  would not be congruent with each other.   There  is\r\n\r\nalways  this contention of valuation methods  adopted  by\r\n\r\nthe private companies and the Government valuers.  Hence,\r\n\r\nthe  difference in market values.  Please review the Act,\r\n\r\nespecially the determination of a fair compensation based\r\n\r\non  the  current market value so as not to cause hardship\r\n\r\nand   allow   for   a   lateral  move  immediately   upon\r\n\r\nnotification   and  declaration  and  pay  the   affected\r\n\r\nproperty  owner  promptly  and  adequately.   Assist  the\r\n\r\nowners on the outstanding loan interest of their property\r\n\r\nthat  they  will still have to pay in view of the  forced\r\n\r\nearly termination of the loan.  Singaporeans are aware of\r\n\r\nthe necessity and support the Government.  However, it is\r\n\r\ntime   to  review  this  Act  for  adequacy,  streamlined\r\n\r\nprocesses and prompt payment for fair compensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> First, let me deal with\r\n\r\nthe  cut  on  Legal Aid.  Mr Arthur Fong has  joined  the\r\n\r\ncalls of Members of Parliament years before to raise  the\r\n\r\nmeans test of the Legal Aid Act.  In fact, we have heeded\r\n\r\nthese calls because the means test is periodically looked\r\n\r\nat and we do raise it when necessary.  As Mr Fong himself\r\n\r\nhas said, we raised it some 23 months ago, in April 2001.\r\n\r\nThe  current  test  is  more generous  and,  indeed,  has\r\n\r\nresulted in more applicants being granted legal aid.  Let\r\n\r\nme cite some numbers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the amendment, just 23 months ago, the\r\n\r\ndisposable income limit was $7,000 and this was raised to\r\n\r\n$10,000   per   annum.   The  allowance  deductions   for\r\n\r\ncalculating the disposable income was increased to $3,000\r\n\r\nfor  the applicant and $2,000 for each dependant.   Under\r\n\r\nthis  more  generous  means test, a family  of,  say,  4,\r\n\r\ncomprising 2 parents and 2 dependent children, where only\r\n\r\nthe  husband works, would qualify for legal  aid  if  the\r\n\r\nfather's  gross monthly income is about $1,850, that  is,\r\n\r\nafter making\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeductions  for himself, CPF and dependants.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nevery  one will want the means test to be raised  higher.\r\n\r\nAnd,  whatever cut-off we take, there will  be  some  who\r\n\r\nwill miss it.  Mr Fong cited the case of his constituent,\r\n\r\nthe  single lady who is earning $2,000.  So that  is  the\r\n\r\nunfortunate  thing which will still be  the  case  if  we\r\n\r\nraise  it  further.  But the point really is that  we  do\r\n\r\nassess the test periodically and, as we have shown, we do\r\n\r\nraise it when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the numbers? The number of persons\r\n\r\ngranted  legal  aid,  after the last  revision,  actually\r\n\r\nincreased 40%.  There was also a substantial increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  percentage of applicants who successfully  qualified\r\n\r\nfor  legal aid - increasing from 66% of applicants in  FY\r\n\r\n1999 to 81% in FY 2001.  In other words, more were helped\r\n\r\nand fewer applicants were turned away.  We expect, by the\r\n\r\nend  of  FY  2002, the number of persons who qualify  for\r\n\r\nlegal  aid  for the last financial year would  be  around\r\n\r\n4,500, representing a 6% increase over FY 2001.  Also, we\r\n\r\nexpect  the  percentage of applicants who do not  qualify\r\n\r\nfor  legal aid to fall from 19% to 12%.  What I am saying\r\n\r\nis  that  the enhanced means test helps more people.   We\r\n\r\nwill  continue to monitor and, if need be, we will adjust\r\n\r\nit accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point about legal aid is the point that Mr\r\n\r\nChandra  Mohan and Mr Low Thia Khiang have made, ie,  why\r\n\r\nnot  the  State also provide legal aid in criminal  cases\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not  death sentence cases.   Again,  we  have\r\n\r\ndebated  this  point  before in the House.   The  crucial\r\n\r\npoint   to  note  and  the  crucial  difference   between\r\n\r\nproviding legal aid for criminal and civil cases is this:\r\n\r\nthat  the State spends a lot of resources in maintaining,\r\n\r\nas best as possible, a top-rate law enforcement machinery\r\n\r\nand  an  excellent  legal service, including  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutors that Mr Chandra Mohan  and  I  talked\r\n\r\nabout  just  now,  to  ensure  Singaporeans'  safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity.   That  is on the one hand.  Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nincongruous and inconsistent that public funds should  be\r\n\r\nused to defend an accused person which the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState,  in the public interest, has decided ought  to  be\r\n\r\ncharged  in  court,  and will do its  best  to  secure  a\r\n\r\nconviction, so that he will be punished, either fined  or\r\n\r\nlocked  behind  bars and at, the same  time,  use  public\r\n\r\nfunds  to try to prevent that from happening.  Whilst  it\r\n\r\nis,  from  Mr Low Thia Khiang's point of view,  something\r\n\r\nfrom the heart, we ought to, if you think about it, it is\r\n\r\nsomething which is incongruous and inconsistent.  But, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if  a  life is at stake, then this principle  is\r\n\r\nadjusted and we do provide legal aid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me assure both Members that these accused\r\n\r\npersons  are  not  left without recourse.   In  fact,  Mr\r\n\r\nChandra  Mohan  and  Mr  Low Thia  Khiang  mentioned  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS).  This is  a  wonderful\r\n\r\nscheme run by the Law Society, started several years ago,\r\n\r\nin 1995, which receives very strong support from lawyers,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  young ones.  I have attended  some  of\r\n\r\ntheir functions and, indeed, in the legal census, one  of\r\n\r\nthe results we got was that the lawyers felt that more of\r\n\r\nthem  should  do community service.  I think  this  is  a\r\n\r\nwonderful  way  in which lawyers can reach  out  to  less\r\n\r\nfortunate Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this scheme provides really an opportunity,\r\n\r\ncurrently, for 400 volunteer lawyers on its panel  to  do\r\n\r\nlegal  aid.   Mr  Low says that not so  many  people  are\r\n\r\nhelped.   I  think he cited the figure of 20%.   CLAS  is\r\n\r\nconsidering  expanding its scheme.  I understand  that  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  has  been  set up to see  whether  or  not  if\r\n\r\naccused  persons  plead guilty, then they  can  also  get\r\n\r\nlegal aid in exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLAS has also been reaching out to the public on its\r\n\r\nown.   I  understand it conducts talks on the ground.   I\r\n\r\nthink  one  was conducted somewhere in Yew  Tee  sometime\r\n\r\nago,  and  also its application form is on  the  website.\r\n\r\nSo,  if  you  think  about it, it  is  really  a  win-win\r\n\r\nsituation,  because  here you have got  lawyers  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared to do community service.  What can the State do?\r\n\r\nThe State should not directly fund counsel to oppose DPPs\r\n\r\narguing cases in court.  We do not fund CLAS as such, but\r\n\r\nthe Minister and myself\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactively  help raise funds for CLAS in their annual  fund\r\n\r\nraising  golf  tournament.   We  would  not  mention  the\r\n\r\nfigures  here, but certainly we make it a point to  help.\r\n\r\nBecause  every  year,  they  will  approach  us  and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, the Minister, who is a golfing Minister, will\r\n\r\ngo  out of his way - I do not know how he does it  -  but\r\n\r\nhe manages to raise one or two flights for CLAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue is Mr Chandra Mohan's point about\r\n\r\nwhy not privatise our legal system.  I think he mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  court  system.  When we say we want to attract  non-Singaporeans  to use our services in Singapore,  all  and\r\n\r\nsundry  can  come, provided, of course, the  question  of\r\n\r\njurisdiction  is satisfied.  And, in particular,  whether\r\n\r\nor not litigants want to fight their cases here.  Are the\r\n\r\nassets  here  where, if they win, they  can  go  against?\r\n\r\nWill  the other party object?  So, these are issues which\r\n\r\nthe  court  will have to decide.  Whilst our  courts  are\r\n\r\nopen, I think, in terms of the court process, it may  not\r\n\r\nbe as convenient or the way to go as opposed to the other\r\n\r\nADR  processes that Mr Chandra Mohan himself  had  talked\r\n\r\nabout.   I  think that must be the way to  go.   We  must\r\n\r\nfacilitate the work of SIAC.  We must facilitate the work\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Mediation Centre so that foreign parties\r\n\r\nwill want to come here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is Mr Ravindran's point about State land. This\r\n\r\nis  a matter which has been debated at each Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply.   Over the years, we have done more and  more  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  vacant  State land on the  ground  is  well\r\n\r\nutilised.  First, we reviewed the TOL fees for the use of\r\n\r\nState land in 2000, and again last year.  As a result  of\r\n\r\nthis  review, grassroots organisations using  State  land\r\n\r\nfor community purpose now enjoy a total discount of about\r\n\r\n85%  of the market rate. So, the TOL for a football field\r\n\r\nof  6,000  square metres has been reduced from  $1,500  a\r\n\r\nmonth to only $180 a month.  I am sure this will help the\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations to pay for these TOL fees, which\r\n\r\nare  phased  in  over  10 years.   And  this  is  why  Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran's own ward benefitted from getting a hard court\r\n\r\nrecently.  I hope more of such land can be used.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of making it more accessible, this is also\r\n\r\nanother point which we have borne in mind, arising  again\r\n\r\nfrom  previous COS debates.  So, last year,  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLaw  and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) set up an  e-marketing  portal called State Property  Information  On-Line  (SPIO).   SPIO  is a convenient one-stop  shopfront\r\n\r\ngiving  access to a range of State properties  available.\r\n\r\nIn  October last year, SLA added an additional feature to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  portal's usefulness.  This is  a  dedicated\r\n\r\nwebsite   to   facilitate  applications  by  constituency\r\n\r\nsecretariat  offices  to  use  vacant  State   land   for\r\n\r\ncommunity purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, SLA has worked with other stakeholders to\r\n\r\nmake  available more land for the public.   For  example,\r\n\r\nSLA  worked  with  the Singapore Sports Council  to  make\r\n\r\navailable some 4.4 hectares of State land at Marina South\r\n\r\nfor  community sports and recreational use.  The land has\r\n\r\nbeen  converted into six soccer pitches,  adding  to  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of good standard playfields available for  public\r\n\r\nuse nationwide.  Hopefully, we will see more Fandi Ahmads\r\n\r\nand  Sundramoorthys.  Also, SLA, with the  assistance  of\r\n\r\nMOE,  has  helped  to facilitate co-sharing  arrangements\r\n\r\nbetween   secondary  schools  and  Citizens  Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees from the neighbouring areas for the shared use\r\n\r\nof  school fields.  Such arrangements allow the public to\r\n\r\nutilise  the school fields for community activities  when\r\n\r\nit  is not in use by the school, thus helping to maximise\r\n\r\nutilisation of land resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received positive feedback on these\r\n\r\ninitiatives and we will continue to press on.  There have\r\n\r\nbeen  more  requests also for more choice of  sites,  and\r\n\r\nalso  sites to be allowed for a wider variety of use.   I\r\n\r\nwill ask SLA to work with URA and other relevant agencies\r\n\r\nto  expand  the number of State property sites  available\r\n\r\nand for more of these to be made available on SPIO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor and Mdm Cynthia Phua have made a point\r\n\r\nabout  compensation  under  the  Land  Acquisition   Act.\r\n\r\nFirst, let\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nme  say that the Ministry of Law is aware of some of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and  hardships arising  from  some  of  the\r\n\r\nacquisitions.  To ameliorate the financial hardship faced\r\n\r\nby  landowners, I am sure the two Members will know that,\r\n\r\nover the years, we have introduced a slew of measures  to\r\n\r\nreach out and to ameliorate hardships on the ground.  And\r\n\r\nthey  have  mentioned some of these - ex-gratia  payments\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1982 and enhanced over the years.  We  have\r\n\r\nprovided housing assistance, introduced in 1999,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  also  started  this new payment  -  reimbursing  of\r\n\r\nremoval expenses and valuation fees.  That was in 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the statutory date of compensation, that is\r\n\r\nregularly  updated  to ensure that compensations  are  in\r\n\r\nline  with  current  values.   The  statutory  date   was\r\n\r\nreviewed  in  1988,  1993 and 1995.  More  recently,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  decided to retain the current statutory  date\r\n\r\nof  1st January 1995, as with the current depressed state\r\n\r\nof  the property market, current market values are  below\r\n\r\nthe 1995 values.  So, if something is acquired today, the\r\n\r\nowner will get market value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the statutory compensation is below current\r\n\r\nmarket  value,  most owners are given ex-gratia  payments\r\n\r\nsubject  to  a cap of $3 million.  That was  also  raised\r\n\r\nfrom  $2  million.  Also, as current property prices  are\r\n\r\nstill  below  the 1st January 1995 levels, the  statutory\r\n\r\ncompensations paid to owners are already at  the  current\r\n\r\nmarket  value.  Let me assure both Dr Khor and  Mdm  Phua\r\n\r\nthat  for the future, we will continue and, if necessary,\r\n\r\nreview  the scheme of ex-gratia payments such  that,  for\r\n\r\nall  practical purposes, the total compensation  received\r\n\r\nwill come up to the current market value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran has asked about sentencing policy. He\r\n\r\nasked  whether  the  sentencing policies  have  fulfilled\r\n\r\ntheir  purposes and what have been the collateral  costs,\r\n\r\nand whether the approach currently taken can be improved.\r\n\r\nI think he mentioned his concerns about mandatory minimum\r\n\r\nsentences  and tariffs of sentencing.  As he well  knows,\r\n\r\nas  a  lawyer,  the outcome of our sentencing  policy  is\r\n\r\nreally an interplay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween Parliament on the one hand and the courts on  the\r\n\r\nother.   So,  both have their respective roles  to  play.\r\n\r\nParliament  sets  for  offences  a  sentencing  range  of\r\n\r\nimprisonment of up to, say, five years or a fine or both,\r\n\r\nand  leaves it to the courts to determine the appropriate\r\n\r\nsentence  for each case.  Sentencing policy is determined\r\n\r\nby  the  courts.   Hence,  the  courts  will  have  their\r\n\r\nsentencing  guidelines  so  as  to  ensure  that  similar\r\n\r\nsentences  are  given  by different  judges  for  similar\r\n\r\noffences.  So, the tariffs, as Mr Ravindan puts  it,  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  to ensure consistency in sentences,  which  is\r\n\r\nalso a feature of justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran mentioned mandatory minimum sentences.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not  the only country that  has  mandatory\r\n\r\nsentences.   Many countries, including US, UK,  Australia\r\n\r\nand  Canada, which embrace more liberal justice  systems,\r\n\r\nalso   have   mandatory  sentences.    Before   mandatory\r\n\r\nsentences are imposed, it is carefully considered whether\r\n\r\nwe should do so and, indeed, we actually do so sparingly.\r\n\r\nThere  are  less than 100 offences on our  statute  books\r\n\r\nwhich  carry  mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment\r\n\r\nand, in most cases, the minimum is one year or less.  So,\r\n\r\nwhen   Parliament  prescribes  penalties  for  particular\r\n\r\noffences in our legislation, it considers the seriousness\r\n\r\nand  prevalence of the offence.  That is what  Parliament\r\n\r\ncan  do.  For example, Members will recall 2-3 years ago,\r\n\r\nwe changed the way in which the punishment structure will\r\n\r\nwork against offenders who commit maid abuse.  That was a\r\n\r\nreflection of the seriousness of the offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, when we impose mandatory minimum\r\n\r\nsentences,  we  send a very strong deterrent  message  to\r\n\r\nwould-be  offenders that these are very serious  offences\r\n\r\nand they should think three times before committing them.\r\n\r\nA  good  example  would be robbery  in  lifts,  which  is\r\n\r\ncurrently hogging the limelight.  Other serious  offences\r\n\r\nthat  carry  mandatory sentences will include  aggravated\r\n\r\nmolest,  armed offence and, indeed, harbouring of illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants, which Mr Ravindran mentioned, because of  the\r\n\r\ndire consequences that this can cause.  Hence,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeterrence  remains the key plank in our penal philosophy\r\n\r\nand,  indeed, we should not be apologetic about the tough\r\n\r\nstand  against crime, which makes Singapore a safe place.\r\n\r\nThe Mercer report, recently released and UK-based, ranked\r\n\r\nSingapore top in Asia and second in the world for safety,\r\n\r\nand  this  was done just 4-5 months ago; in other  words,\r\n\r\npost-September  11.  Even in this era, Singapore  is  not\r\n\r\nfound  wanting  and  continues to do  well.   Safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  in  Singapore is a key economic attribute.   It\r\n\r\nnot  only ensures a good quality of life for us, but also\r\n\r\nbrings investments into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we should leave the courts to determine the\r\n\r\nsentencing  approach.   Of course, even  with  sentencing\r\n\r\nguidelines,  every Judge would have to decide  the  case,\r\n\r\nincluding  the sentences, according to the  facts  before\r\n\r\nhim.   But increasingly, even as we retain deterrence  as\r\n\r\nthe  key  plank in our penal philosophy,  I  am  sure  Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran  will  agree that we have  also  moved  towards\r\n\r\nrehabilitation,  in other words, to maintain  a  balance.\r\n\r\nEvery society has to find that balance and doing both  is\r\n\r\nnot  inconsistent.  In other words, we can  still  remain\r\n\r\ntough  and  have  deterrent sentences,  but  do  more  to\r\n\r\nrehabilitate those who go astray, particularly those  who\r\n\r\nare  genuine and who are first timers.  This is  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening in Singapore, particularly, MHA with  its  many\r\n\r\ncommunity-based   sentences  which  it  has   introduced,\r\n\r\nincluding home detention and other measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is the way to go. But having said\r\n\r\nthis,  of  course,  it is not cast  in  stone.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to find a balance.  But the key thing is we must\r\n\r\nretain  a  system where there is incentive for those  who\r\n\r\nare  law  abiding, even if they breach the law,  like  we\r\n\r\nmentioned  just  now and earlier on the  Minister  talked\r\n\r\nabout decriminalising regulatory offences, they will know\r\n\r\nthat they would have a second chance and those who are so\r\n\r\nminded to commit serious crimes which will cause harm  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and bring disrepute to us, I think they must\r\n\r\nbe  sent  a  strong  message.  So  let  us  maintain  the\r\n\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I seek a clarification\r\n\r\nfrom the Senior Minister of State?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> OK.

Does he agree whether  or  not\r\n\r\nexpenditure  incurred to provide legal aid  depends  very\r\n\r\nmuch  on  what we value as a society?  Do we  value  more\r\n\r\njustice or efficiency?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

He  is  not a criminal.  As the  Member  knows,\r\n\r\nunder  our criminal system, the prosecution has to  prove\r\n\r\nits case beyond a reasonable doubt, a very heavy onus  of\r\n\r\nproof.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> He has no lawyer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

I think I have  explained  why,\r\n\r\nphilosophically, jurisprudentially, practically, it  does\r\n\r\nnot  make sense for the State to both prosecute and  then\r\n\r\ndefend, in the public interest.  Do not forget, when  the\r\n\r\nState prosecutes, it goes through a very detailed process\r\n\r\nand the conclusion is that this person has done something\r\n\r\nwhich  ought to be punished.  The right hand says, \"Let's\r\n\r\npunish  him.\"  The left hand says, \"Let's get  him  out.\"\r\n\r\nSo the two are being pulled apart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point here is that these people are not without\r\n\r\nrecourse because CLAS does good work.  In time,  if  more\r\n\r\npeople support CLAS, the scheme can be expanded.

You  have  six minutes, including the  Minister's\r\n\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Yes, I will try and move\r\n\r\nfast.   Sir,  my cuts are on international  law,  foreign\r\n\r\nlawyers  and  recognition of foreign law degrees.   I  am\r\n\r\ninformed,   Sir,  that,  currently,  not  many  Singapore\r\n\r\nlawyers and local law firms are involved in international\r\n\r\nlaw practice.  It is mainly the American, the British and\r\n\r\nperhaps the Australian who were practising in foreign law\r\n\r\nfirms in Singapore.  They practise international law.  If\r\n\r\npossible, we should try to change this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of the international law is handled by State\r\n\r\nlawyers   at   the  AG's  Chambers  and  they   have   an\r\n\r\nInternational  Division over there.   Perhaps,  something\r\n\r\ncould  be done where there could be some synergy  between\r\n\r\nthe  practising lawyers and the AG's Chambers to work out\r\n\r\nsomething  so  that  they  could  try  and  embark   into\r\n\r\ninternational  law  practice which, I believe,  has  been\r\n\r\nlong overdue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was the President of the Law Society, I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  for instance, when Australia was  trying  to\r\n\r\nassist  the  Vietnamese in some drafting of  legislation,\r\n\r\nthey  got involved and they begged the Australian lawyers\r\n\r\nto  legislate and to get the drafting done.  So  in  that\r\n\r\nsense, the Government was helping the Australian law firm\r\n\r\nto  get  the  legal business and coming to a stage  where\r\n\r\nthey could practise international law.  So I think it  is\r\n\r\nimportant if the Government agencies, especially the AG's\r\n\r\nChambers,  the Ministry of Law and the Law Society  could\r\n\r\nwork together and see what is possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to declare my interest also. I\r\n\r\nam  in  the International Relations Committee of the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety  and, in fact, one of the things being  discussed\r\n\r\nis  to  even have a legal tour of the United Nations  and\r\n\r\nsee  what  can be done.  We could work perhaps  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and see what is possible.   I\r\n\r\nwould encourage the Ministries to try and assist in  this\r\n\r\nmatter  so that we, in the legal profession in Singapore,\r\n\r\ncould\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregionalise  and  internationalise and  get  involved  in\r\n\r\ninternational law work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards foreign lawyers, Sir, the Attorney-General's Chambers is the department that deals with\r\n\r\ngranting  of foreign licences.  I would like to know  how\r\n\r\nmany  foreign  law firms there are now in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthose  that are in partnership with local law  firms  and\r\n\r\nwhat  has  been  the experience.  Has it succeeded  to  a\r\n\r\nlarge  extent?  Is there also cooperation between foreign\r\n\r\nlaw  firms  and  Singapore law  firms?   Has  there  been\r\n\r\ndissemination of legal expertise to the local lawyers  so\r\n\r\nthat   we   can   improve  on  our  regionalisation   and\r\n\r\ninternationalisation of our local law firms?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on recognition of law degrees, I see now there\r\n\r\nis   recognition  of  -  back  to  the  old  days  -  the\r\n\r\nAustralian,  Canadian  and some  other  law  degrees  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  even  the  US degrees.  I  would  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  our local law degree, NUS law degree,  would  be\r\n\r\nrecognised  in  other  countries  also  as  a  reciprocal\r\n\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho Peng Kee, you have three\r\n\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> He has used two minutes\r\n\r\nto  ask his questions.  First, the point about using more\r\n\r\nlawyers  in international arena.  In fact, AGC  does  tap\r\n\r\nthe private sector where it is relevant.  For example,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  they  tap private  sector  lawyers  for\r\n\r\nadvice in relation to free trade agreements.  But it  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  done  very much because, as Mr  Mohan  himself\r\n\r\nsays,  it is a very specialised area and expertise  among\r\n\r\nour  lawyers  out there in international law  is  not  so\r\n\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of helping our lawyers move into the\r\n\r\nmarket, that has been done and more can be done.  He will\r\n\r\nknow,  for example, a trip was organised last year  where\r\n\r\nSG  led  a  team  to China, together with TDB  and  other\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies.   And I myself  will  be  going  to\r\n\r\nChina.  I went last year, and I will be going again soon.\r\n\r\nI will make it a point to also try to open doors, talk to\r\n\r\nlawyers there as well as also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  lawyers who are working there,  to  help  them\r\n\r\nnetwork.   I  think that we can do.  But, ultimately,  if\r\n\r\nSingapore lawyers want to get into the international  law\r\n\r\nmarket,  they  must be prepared to make  that  adjustment\r\n\r\nthemselves.  I understand not that many Singapore lawyers\r\n\r\nare  prepared to be based overseas or, indeed, to fly  in\r\n\r\nand  out of, say, China, or India.  In fact, this is  the\r\n\r\nother  way.   If  you do not want to be  based  overseas,\r\n\r\nincurring  costs, you must be prepared to  do  a  bit  of\r\n\r\nthat, to meet the needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For foreign law firms, currently, we have 64 foreign\r\n\r\nlaw  firms in Singapore from 50 jurisdictions.  There are\r\n\r\n549  registered  foreign lawyers who  can  only  practise\r\n\r\nforeign  law.  What about this new approach that we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced  - not more than three years ago -  the  joint\r\n\r\nlaw  venture and formal law alliances?  I think it is too\r\n\r\nearly  to  say  whether or not it  has  succeeded.   But,\r\n\r\ncertainly,  in  terms  of  benefits  that  have  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  these benefits are there.  For example,  more\r\n\r\nSingapore  lawyers are trained in international financial\r\n\r\nwork.   That  has  been achieved by the majority  of  the\r\n\r\njoint law ventures, in terms of frequency and numbers who\r\n\r\nhave  been  trained.  Singapore lawyers can also  benefit\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their  potential usefulness  to  the  global\r\n\r\npartners who are operating in other financial centres  in\r\n\r\nthe region, enhancing networking.  Singapore will network\r\n\r\nwith   other  regional  centres  through  their   foreign\r\n\r\npartners,   of  course,  not  forgetting  the   core   of\r\n\r\nprofessional contacts that has been built over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that we will continue to monitor the\r\n\r\nscheme and we will only make improvements or fine-tunings\r\n\r\nafter the five-year period is up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

The collapse of the World Trade Centre has\r\n\r\nramifications  far and wide for all  of  us.   The  shock\r\n\r\nwaves   have  hit  our  shores.   We  uncovered  the   JI\r\n\r\nunderground  cells in Singapore as well as  in  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines and Indonesia.  It was a rude awakening,\r\n\r\na  walk-up  call for all of us.

There  would   be   horrendous\r\n\r\nconsequences,  if we were caught napping  or  unprepared.\r\n\r\nNo  one  in  his right mind would therefore question  the\r\n\r\nneed  to build up and maintain our defence forces.  Every\r\n\r\ndollar spent on defence is a dollar well spent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we cannot defend what we have, if we cannot\r\n\r\nguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity, then  we\r\n\r\nwill be at the mercy of others.

Against  this\r\n\r\nbackground,  there  are  protests  against   a   possible\r\n\r\nAmerican war against Iraq.  There are mass demonstrations\r\n\r\non  the  ground and the countries are polarised  in  this\r\n\r\ndispute.  A second UN resolution may or may not be passed\r\n\r\nat  the UN Security Council.

Japan and South Korea are worried\r\n\r\nstiff  indeed over the possible fallout from North Korea.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  is  some hope that the  issue  could  be\r\n\r\naddressed amicably at the negotiation table.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister for his\r\n\r\nreading  of  the  Iraqi situation and  the  North  Korean\r\n\r\nproblem,  and what is their impact on Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the SAF is\r\n\r\nable  and  ready to defend Singapore against all threats,\r\n\r\nin   particular,  with  the  changing  geo-political  and\r\n\r\nsecurity situation in Southeast Asia, whether the SAF  is\r\n\r\ngeared up and trained to deal with counter-terrorism  and\r\n\r\nlow intensity operations.  Further, what is the state  of\r\n\r\nour   defence  relations  with  Malaysia,  Thailand,  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines   and  Indonesia?   Are  our   armed   forces\r\n\r\nparticipating,   for   example,  in   confidence-building\r\n\r\nmeasures,  exchanges  and  joint  exercises  with   these\r\n\r\ncountries?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, the world\r\n\r\ntoday  finds itself in a new strategic environment marked\r\n\r\nby  great  uncertainty and complexity.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nquickly   highlight   three   developments   which   have\r\n\r\nimplications for regional security.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the US' push for war against Iraq and its\r\n\r\nunabashed willingness to go it alone without the sanction\r\n\r\nof  the  United States.  The emergence of the US  as  the\r\n\r\nsole  superpower willing and able to act outside  the  UN\r\n\r\nhas  grave implications on our notion of balance of power\r\n\r\nas the foundation for regional and global stability.  The\r\n\r\nUS  has emerged as the sole superpower with unilateralist\r\n\r\ninstincts which can breed resentment in some parts of the\r\n\r\nworld.   Some powers are clearly wary of a US war against\r\n\r\nIraq.   For  these powers, such as China and France,  the\r\n\r\nwar  on  Iraq  could  signal enhanced  US  primacy,  with\r\n\r\nincreased   control   over  Iraqi  oil,   and   continued\r\n\r\nunilateral   behaviour  in  the  international   security\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Even now, we can see the different  powers\r\n\r\njockeying for influence in the UN Security Council.   The\r\n\r\ninternational environment appears unsettled and anarchic,\r\n\r\nand  states  have to take care of their own  security  as\r\n\r\nbest as they can, and have to be nimble to respond to the\r\n\r\nchanging power balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the situation in North Korea seems to be\r\n\r\napproaching  a  dangerous new level.   According  to  the\r\n\r\nKyodo  News  Agency,  Tokyo might  deploy  Aegis-equipped\r\n\r\nwarships with missile-tracking technology near the Korean\r\n\r\nPeninsula.   The Pentagon has meanwhile put 24 long-range\r\n\r\nbombers  on  alert for possible despatch to  the  region.\r\n\r\nSome  analysts  believe that once Washington  commits  to\r\n\r\nmilitary  action  in  Iraq, North Korea  will  seize  the\r\n\r\nmoment  to  realise its nuclear ambitions and to  exploit\r\n\r\nthe  uncertainty.  Such an event could  prompt  Japan  to\r\n\r\nfollow  North  Korea's  lead in going  nuclear,  dragging\r\n\r\nChina  into  the arms race, with devastating consequences\r\n\r\nfor peace and prosperity in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, if there is a war against Iraq, with or\r\n\r\nwithout UN sanction, there is likely to be a wave of anti-American protests in the Southeast Asian region, which is\r\n\r\npredominantly  Muslim.  The situation is expected  to  be\r\n\r\nmost  unpredictable  in Indonesia, since  its  transition\r\n\r\ntowards pluralism and democracy has meant that it is less\r\n\r\nable  to  control  mass protests.  And with  the  looming\r\n\r\nelections, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpected  that different politicians might seek  to  make\r\n\r\nsome  political mileage with the Muslim ground.  So  far,\r\n\r\nhowever,  it is good to note that protests in the  region\r\n\r\nagainst  the war on Iraq have been peaceful, and we  hope\r\n\r\nthat this will continue to be the case.  But the risk for\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  that  with its close  ties  with  the  US,\r\n\r\nSingapore  may  become  the  target  of  radical  Islamic\r\n\r\nterrorists angry at the US.  The Jemaah Islamiyah plot to\r\n\r\nblow  up western targets in Singapore shows how real this\r\n\r\ndanger is.  The terrorist bombing in Bali in October 2002\r\n\r\nand  the  recent  bombing of the  Davao  Airport  in  the\r\n\r\nsouthern  Philippines made clear that terrorism continues\r\n\r\nto be a threat in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given Singapore's geo-strategic importance and the\r\n\r\nfluid  situation in the region, we need  to  upgrade  the\r\n\r\ncapabilities  of  the  SAF  to defend  Singapore  against\r\n\r\npotential  conventional  threats,  as  well  as  build  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   infrastructure   to   protect   it   from\r\n\r\nterrorism.   We also need to beef up our capabilities  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with the threat of chemical and biological warfare.\r\n\r\nWe  need to commit the financial resources needed.   This\r\n\r\nis  not the time to stinge on defence but to increase it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we need to keep explaining the security\r\n\r\nimperatives  and the changing landscape to  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nso  that they will support this push for an even stronger\r\n\r\nSAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, where the threats from rogue states\r\n\r\nand international terrorists are at least as dangerous as\r\n\r\nrivalry  among  major powers, I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for his assessment on the security outlook  for\r\n\r\nthe  region  and  how  we  are gearing  up  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the September 11 terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks in the United States have redefined the nature of\r\n\r\nsecurity  risks in Singapore.  Far from playing  soldiers\r\n\r\nin  training  to  deal  with enemies  in  a  conventional\r\n\r\nwarfare,  the discovery of a sinister plot by the  JI  to\r\n\r\nundermine  peace  and  security in  Singapore  through  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  terrorist operations drives home the  message\r\n\r\nthat  the  war  against  terrorism  has  arrived  at  our\r\n\r\ndoorsteps.   As  a  consequence of their discovery,  much\r\n\r\nadjustment in the daily routines of Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  to  be  made.  We see, for instance,  uniformed  men\r\n\r\nbearing     assault    rifles    patrolling     important\r\n\r\nestablishments, such as our ports and airports.   It  has\r\n\r\nnow  become  more  inconvenient for the public  to  enter\r\n\r\ncivic  buildings.   In fact, as an MP, coming  into  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I  have had to have my car searched each  time  I\r\n\r\nenter   this  building.   For  many  Singaporeans,   such\r\n\r\ninconveniences are a small price to pay for security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the discovery of the JI terror plot in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it would appear that Singapore is now  at  the\r\n\r\nfrontline of this battle.  The fact that we are  a  close\r\n\r\nally of the United States merely makes Singapore a prized\r\n\r\ntarget  for these potential terror attacks.  To be  sure,\r\n\r\nthese  attacks are not just confined to bombing  acts  of\r\n\r\nterror,  but include other forms of low-intensity attacks\r\n\r\nas  well.  These include biological and chemical  threats\r\n\r\nas  well.   Soon, the United States will attack Iraq,  if\r\n\r\nthe pattern of Iraq's cat-and-mouse game continues.  When\r\n\r\nthat happens, one can expect the level of security threat\r\n\r\nto  heighten.   The  resultant  state  of  tension  would\r\n\r\nunfortunately  give rise to a siege mentality  among  our\r\n\r\npeople.  While our people here will try to go about  life\r\n\r\nas  normally as possible, there will always be this  fear\r\n\r\nand  concern at the back of their mind that an  explosion\r\n\r\ncould  take  place in the backyard.  This has given  them\r\n\r\nmuch  anxiety.  In fact, I know of many Singaporeans here\r\n\r\nwho are beginning to avoid places that are frequented  by\r\n\r\nthe expatriates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the present backdrop of the security\r\n\r\nsituation in Singapore, I would like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Defence whether the Government has taken  additional\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  ensure  the security  of  our  people,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  more  may  not be done to  make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  a  terrorist incident  taking  place  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is almost non-existent.  Additionally, I  would\r\n\r\nalso  appreciate it if the Minister could enlighten  this\r\n\r\nHouse on the extent to which ASEAN member countries  have\r\n\r\nimproved  on  their cooperative framework on intelligence\r\n\r\nsharing since September 11.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Defence  what is  his  assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nthreats  and  vulnerabilities of  the  Singapore  defence\r\n\r\nforces.   In particular, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto   highlight   the  challenges  which  are   posed   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's security in the light of events unfolding  in\r\n\r\nNortheast  Asia and Iraq, and also in the  light  of  the\r\n\r\ncontinuing   challenge  being  posed  by   terrorism   in\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the prognosis for our economy\r\n\r\nthis  year does not seem very good.  If we are lucky,  we\r\n\r\nmay  end up the year with some positive growth.  However,\r\n\r\nif we are unlucky - which seems likely if the war in Iraq\r\n\r\ncontinues  to turn out to be a long and prolonged  one  - there  is a possibility that we may well end up the  year\r\n\r\nin negative territory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it is, we have been told that even if the\r\n\r\neconomy recovers, as a mature economy, we can expect  our\r\n\r\nGDP to grow at best only between 3% and 4% or perhaps  5%\r\n\r\nannually.   This  is  a  far  cry  from  days  past  when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  were  used to our economy  hitting  double-digit  growth.  In fact, it was because of these  double-digit  growth rates that we were able to quickly build  a\r\n\r\nmodern  and  credible SAF, armed with some  of  the  most\r\n\r\ntechnologically  sophisticated  equipment  and   weapons.\r\n\r\nDespite  our  strong economic growth, the Government  has\r\n\r\nalways  exercised self-restraint on defence  spending  by\r\n\r\ncapping  it at 6% of our GDP.  This has worked  well  for\r\n\r\nus,  as  we  have never had to exceed the  cap  that  was\r\n\r\nimposed.  There is no denying that our policy on  defence\r\n\r\nspending  was  the correct thing to do, as it  helped  to\r\n\r\nensure the survival of a small state like Singapore.   In\r\n\r\nthe  words of some, that up to 6% of our GDP spending  is\r\n\r\non  defence is like a premium that Singaporeans  pay  for\r\n\r\ninsurance on security.  Few would deny that the money was\r\n\r\nwell  spent.   Many defence analysts have looked  at  and\r\n\r\ncome to the conclusion that the SAF is one of the leading\r\n\r\narmed forces in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the SAF is a necessity is not in issue. Going\r\n\r\nforward,  however, the question is, whether in the  light\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfalling  GDP  which we are likely to be  faced  with,  we\r\n\r\nshould   increase  the  percentage  cap  on  our  defence\r\n\r\nspending in relation to our GDP.  The point is that, with\r\n\r\na  declining GDP, the absolute amount of defence  dollars\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  raise will diminish.  On the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nweapon   systems  and  platforms,  especially  the   more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  ones, do not come cheap.  If  we  want  to\r\n\r\nmaintain   the   present   level   of   efficiency    and\r\n\r\nsophistication, does it mean that we will have  to  raise\r\n\r\nour  cap  on  defence spending?  And, if a  reduction  in\r\n\r\ndefence  spending is necessary, how will this affect  our\r\n\r\nsecurity  standing?  On the other hand,  there  are  also\r\n\r\nthose  who  would argue that, with a weaker  economy,  we\r\n\r\nshould  perhaps be looking at cutting back on our defence\r\n\r\nspending and using the savings for other projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally do not favour any defence cuts. Giving\r\n\r\nour  SAF  the  military edge should continue  to  be  our\r\n\r\nutmost  priority.   Our  SAF is our  best  assurance  and\r\n\r\nguarantee  for  our long-term survival.  Any  compromise,\r\n\r\neven if it is for the short-term, is likely to have long-term  ramifications on the effectiveness of the SAF as  a\r\n\r\nfighting unit.  We certainly do not want to end  up  like\r\n\r\nsome  other armed forces where the operational efficiency\r\n\r\nof  the  units  was compromised as a result  of  lack  of\r\n\r\nspending.   What assurance can the Minister  for  Defence\r\n\r\ngive this House that this will not be the case?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran:</b> Sir, I am aware that we have a\r\n\r\nvery  strong defence force.  In fact, I was pleased  that\r\n\r\nin  this  year's Budget, we have decided not to  cut  the\r\n\r\nbudget of the Ministry of Defence but instead to increase\r\n\r\nit  by  a marginal figure.  It sends a strong message  to\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans that we will continue to  have  a  very\r\n\r\nstrong  defence  force, one, for the primary  purpose  of\r\n\r\ndeterrence  and, two, for the purpose of defence  of  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also aware that defence equipment and a\r\n\r\nsizeable  NS  manpower  require  substantial  funds.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  R&D  and keeping the edge  require  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ninvestment of funds in cutting-edge technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Defence, in the\r\n\r\nlight of the substantial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount  of  funds  being allocated  to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence,  what measures are in place to ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nfunds  are  always used prudently and, more  importantly,\r\n\r\nthat we always run a tight ship?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, our security and external\r\n\r\nrelations  sector  comprises  the  Ministry  of  Defence,\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs and the Ministry  of  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs.   Government expenditure on this sector accounts\r\n\r\nfor  36% of total expenditure.  MINDEF alone accounts for\r\n\r\n28%.   As  a  category  in  itself,  it  is  the  largest\r\n\r\ncomponent  in our Budget 2003.  Based on CIA  World  Fact\r\n\r\nBook  2002,  our  military  budget  of  $8.25  billion  - approximately  US$4.71 billion - translates  into  almost\r\n\r\n4.9% of our GDP.  Hence, Singapore belongs to one of  the\r\n\r\nminority of 26 countries out of 197 countries which spend\r\n\r\nmore than 4.5% of their GDP on defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do understand the need and importance of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  national defence to  enable  our  armed\r\n\r\nforces  to  increase  its  preparedness  to  handle  both\r\n\r\nconventional  and  unconventional threats.   However,  my\r\n\r\nconcern is that transparency is rather lacking on how the\r\n\r\ndefence  budget  is being used.  Whilst  secrecy  may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  so  as not to compromise military  operational\r\n\r\neffectiveness, I do believe that the public has  a  right\r\n\r\nto  know at least the broad categories of its expenditure\r\n\r\nitems,  especially when we are talking about billions  of\r\n\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the Budget Book, under National\r\n\r\nDefence  Programme,  there is only one  line  under  Code\r\n\r\n2900,  which reads \"Military expenditure\", then  a  total\r\n\r\nallocation of more than $7 billion.  This amount  is  93%\r\n\r\nof MINDEF 's entire estimated budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When billions of dollars of public money is\r\n\r\ninvolved, to have such a wide blanket classification  for\r\n\r\nthis type of estimated expenditure is, to me, lacking  in\r\n\r\ntransparency.   Which  aspects of  military  expenditure?\r\n\r\nWeapon  acquisitions, manpower cost, training or military\r\n\r\noperation?    Is   the  Minister  satisfied   that   this\r\n\r\nexpenditure is necessary and that the Ministry\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas exercised prudence in expenditure control, especially\r\n\r\nat this time of tight budget?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
