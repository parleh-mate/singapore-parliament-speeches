Member will recall that in his Budget\r\n\r\nSpeech,  the  Finance  Minister  has  said  that   the\r\n\r\nunemployment rate in 1976 continued to remain at a low\r\n\r\nlevel of 4.5%. As at the end of last year. 30,750 were\r\n\r\non  the  unemployed register at the Employment Service\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry. My Ministry found that the majority\r\n\r\nof  those  registered preferred white collar  or  soft\r\n\r\njobs.  For  example, 13,069 or 58% of the  22,413  new\r\n\r\nregistrants  last  year wanted white  collar  or  soft\r\n\r\njobs. We also discovered that many were choosy turning\r\n\r\ndown blue collar work offered to them for reasons such\r\n\r\nas   long   distance  from  house,  shift   work   and\r\n\r\nuncongenial   work   environment.   Many   of    those\r\n\r\nregistered, therefore, preferred to be jobless  until\r\n\r\nsomething to their liking comes along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the late 60s the Republic underwent successful\r\n\r\neconomic  development. As a result, we  experienced  a\r\n\r\ntight  labour situation. Given the shortage of skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  and the preference of Singaporeans for  white\r\n\r\ncollar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  soft  jobs,  the Ministry had to issue  liberally\r\n\r\nwork   permits  to  non-residents  for  work  in   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and construction industries. In the case\r\n\r\nof  white collar and soft jobs which Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nfond  of, the Ministry was strict on the issue of work\r\n\r\npermits. The hon.

To ensure uninterrupted\r\n\r\nsupplies  of raw sugar and to help maintain  a  stable\r\n\r\ndomestic  selling price for refined sugar,  the  Sugar\r\n\r\nIndustry  of Singapore has had to enter into long-term\r\n\r\nsupply contracts. The current long-term contracts with\r\n\r\nAustralia  and Fiji, concluded towards the  end  of 1974,\r\n\r\nassured us of raw sugar supplies fully for 1975 - \r\n\r\n77   and   thereafter  up  to  85%  of  our   domestic\r\n\r\nrequirements  until  1980. The  contracted  price  at\r\n\r\nS$689  per  metric tonne was then extremely favourable\r\n\r\ncompared  with  the prevailing market price  of  about\r\n\r\nS$2,580 per metric tonne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Sugar Industry of Singapore was able to\r\n\r\nmaintain the domestic retail price of refined sugar at\r\n\r\n75  cents  per  kati since 1974 to  date.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nSingapore consumers would have had to pay as  much  as\r\n\r\n$2.25 for their kati of sugar if we had to buy on  the\r\n\r\nopen  market  at the peak of world price fluctuations.\r\n\r\nTaking the period between 1974 and now, the price paid\r\n\r\nby  our consumers on the average is about 24 cents per\r\n\r\nkati  lower  than  the average world  price  of  white\r\n\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are no doubt aware that the price of raw\r\n\r\nsugar  on  the world market has fallen. The  price  of\r\n\r\nsugar  paid  under the current contract, however,  has\r\n\r\nincreased  because  of the escalation  index  tied  to\r\n\r\nprices  paid  by  the Australian sugar  industry.  The\r\n\r\nSugar  Industry of Singapore is at present  trying  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss with Australia some improvements in the  terms\r\n\r\nof the contract. Apart from a lower price, it would be\r\n\r\ndesirable  that the new contract should enable  us  to\r\n\r\ndiversify our sources of supply,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nespecially to buy from other ASEAN countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Sugar Industry of Singapore is making a\r\n\r\nloss  at  prevailing prices, I have  no  proposals  at\r\n\r\npresent  to ask SIS to make any revision of the  price\r\n\r\ndownwards,  If necessary, I will consider whether  the\r\n\r\nSugar Industry of Singapore may be allowed adjustments\r\n\r\nto the domestic retail price of sugar when discussions\r\n\r\nare completed. However, any adjustments made will have\r\n\r\nto  take a long term view of the market rather than to\r\n\r\nfollow the erratic movements of world sugar prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  ask supplementary questions? First, why did we  not\r\n\r\nattempt  to  re-negotiate  the  agreement  very   much\r\n\r\nearlier  when we knew that world prices were dropping?\r\n\r\nSecond, we had a price escalation clause. Why  did  we\r\n\r\nnot  negotiate for a price reduction clause? Third,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  Malaysia retails their sugar at  65  cents  a\r\n\r\nkati  and  we have the same sort of contract with  the\r\n\r\ncountries mentioned by the Hon. Minister. Why is  that\r\n\r\nso? Why are we retailing our sugar at 75 cents a kati?\r\n\r\nFourth,  why did we not have the foresight to  realise\r\n\r\nthat the sugar prices could have dipped and so have  a\r\n\r\nshorter term instead of that long-term contract?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is\r\n\r\nsimple.  The  Sugar  Industry  of  Singapore  made   a\r\n\r\ncommercial  judgment  and  decided  that  a  long-term\r\n\r\ncontract was desirable. Therefore, it entered into the\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  present contract.  At  that  time,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it was favourable. As I have said, the  price\r\n\r\nwas  then  very low. The escalation clause  was  built\r\n\r\ninto  the  contract, because this was related  to  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  labour in Australia. The intention was  that\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  contract  would  enable  Australia  to\r\n\r\nexpand their growing of sugar cane and that the  price\r\n\r\nwould  be  sufficient to enable their growers  to  pay\r\n\r\ntheir labour at the expected escalation in wages which\r\n\r\nwould  result  in the following years.  There  was  no\r\n\r\npossibility of a reduction in price downwards  because\r\n\r\nof the nature of the contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we are paying 75 cents in Singapore\r\n\r\ninstead of 65 cents as in Malaysia is that we kept the\r\n\r\nexcise  tax  at  a  level which we  have  always  been\r\n\r\ncharging,  that  is,  10 cents,  while  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment thought it possible for them to  waive  the\r\n\r\ntax  altogether. That is the reason for the difference\r\n\r\nbetween  their  price and our price.

Some of these  are  what\r\n\r\nprices  are  being negotiated, the effect on  growers.\r\n\r\nthat  is, whether they grow more sugar cane, and  also\r\n\r\nthe effect of the new processes of making liquid sugar\r\n\r\nof a different kind, not cane sugar but from wheat and\r\n\r\ncorn.  All  these have an effect on prices. If  anyone\r\n\r\ncan  tell  me  whether the price is going  upwards  or\r\n\r\ndownwards,  I  would be very pleased.

So  we  are not in control  of  the  Sugar\r\n\r\nIndustry  of Singapore except to the extent  that  40%\r\n\r\ngives any particular shareholder control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAX ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\n(a)  what are the various rates of property tax levied\r\n\r\non  residential  property; (b) how  much  revenue  was\r\n\r\ncollected  in respect of each category in FY  76;  and\r\n\r\n(c)  what is the estimated revenue in respect of  each\r\n\r\ncategory for FY 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is\r\n\r\ndivided  into several zones for purposes  of  applying\r\n\r\nproperty tax assessment rates as prescribed under  the\r\n\r\nProperty  Tax  (Rates) Order, 1971.  These  zones  are\r\n\r\nshown in the Property Tax Rate Plan which is available\r\n\r\nfor  inspection  by  members  of  the  public  in  the\r\n\r\nProperty Tax Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Plan, the highest assessment rate of 36%\r\n\r\nis  levied  on residential properties in  the  central\r\n\r\ncity  areas  and  in  the southern islands  comprising\r\n\r\nSentosa, Sarong Island, Pulau Brani.

For other  owner-occupied\r\n\r\ndwelling  houses, concessionary assessment  rates  of\r\n\r\n14%, 16%, 18%, 19%, 20% or 23% apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProperties  with  annual  value  of  less  than  $240.\r\n\r\nwhether owner-occupied or not, are also subject to the\r\n\r\nsame  rates.

I think the Property Tax Department and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Finance have been trying  for  many\r\n\r\nyears  to  rationalise the rates of property  tax.  If\r\n\r\nMembers  will  have  noticed  when  I  read  out   the\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rates, it varies from  14%,  16%.  18%.\r\n\r\n19%.  20% to 23%. I cannot myself imagine that a  fine\r\n\r\ndistinction can be drawn between properties which  are\r\n\r\nonly  worthy  of  14% and other properties  which  are\r\n\r\nworthy  of  15% rates. Members will also notice  that\r\n\r\nthere are attap houses where the rate is $6 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been trying to revise the property rates to a\r\n\r\nuniform  consistent  rate. The difficulty  is  not  to\r\n\r\nrevise the rates downwards from the higher rates of up\r\n\r\nto  36%, as I think most Members would like me to  do.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is really raising the other lower rates\r\n\r\nupwards, so that there will be a uniform rate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>MAIN AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES OF SINGAPORE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 1977 TO 31ST MARCH, 1978</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee of Supply [3rd Allotted Day].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.06 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head S (cont.) -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question (16th March, 1977).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum to be allocated for Head S be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10  in respect of subhead AAA 1004*.\" - [Mr Ngeow Pack Hua].

But the  compensation  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient. Why is this so? If that piece of  land  at\r\n\r\nSomerset Road is auctioned, it should fetch $30 or $40\r\n\r\nper square foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> More!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, more than that. I am not a\r\n\r\nland  valuer.  The  Government  should  compensate   a\r\n\r\ncharitable organisation like the Hindu Endowment Board\r\n\r\nadequately. This is a charitable organisation and  not\r\n\r\nan   individual  land  owner.  The  Government  should\r\n\r\nconsider paying reasonable compensation for the  piece\r\n\r\nof land at Somerset Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative site, the Government has offered a\r\n\r\npiece of land at Toa Payoh for $8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper   square   foot.  But  for  the  other   religious\r\n\r\norganisations the Government is charging only  $4  per\r\n\r\nsquare foot. The Hindu Endowment Board is a charitable\r\n\r\norganisation  and  is  under the  Ministry  of  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs.  It  is not a private organisation  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can charge $8 or $10 per square  foot.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment should consider charging a reasonable price\r\n\r\nfor  the land at Toa Payoh. Sir, I am bringing up this\r\n\r\nmatter  because it has not been resolved  for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime.  Furthermore, when the Board gets the money,  it\r\n\r\nhas  to  construct a temple there, which may take  one\r\n\r\nyear  and the cost will be at least $100,000. And  the\r\n\r\nBoard  has  to pay for the land also. It is  not  land\r\n\r\ngiven free by the Government. We are going to pay  for\r\n\r\nthe  land.  Most probably, it will take  another  year\r\n\r\nbefore  we  have  to  vacate  Somerset  Road.   I   am\r\n\r\nmentioning  this  because the  Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  is here. Could the Minister  settle  this\r\n\r\nproblem  of alternative site for the Hindu  temple  as\r\n\r\nsoon as possible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also received a complaint which was\r\n\r\naddressed to the Minister and copied to me by a  Hindu\r\n\r\ntemple  authority at Woodlands which states  that  the\r\n\r\ntemple  has been closed down by the Government without\r\n\r\nfirst  informing  the  Social Affairs  Ministry.  Even\r\n\r\nthough  the land belongs to the Government, it is  not\r\n\r\nsupposed  to close down the temple before the devotees\r\n\r\nare  informed.  This  action is unfair  to  the  Hindu\r\n\r\nreligious community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you have the time you should go\r\n\r\nand  see  the  Woodlands  temple.  I  think  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister has been to the Woodlands temple. Besides the\r\n\r\nHindu  temple, there is a mosque and a church.  It  is\r\n\r\nunreasonable to lock up the Hindu temple straightaway.\r\n\r\nThis  action amounts to victimising Hinduism? I cannot\r\n\r\nthink  of  another word, therefore I have to  use  the\r\n\r\nword \"victimising\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these matters must be considered by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Social  Affairs.

Before we start building,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  get  suitable men.

And with more and more  people\r\n\r\nmoving  into Housing and Development Board flats,  the\r\n\r\nold  extended family system is breaking  down.  It  is\r\n\r\nunfair  to  get  the  children to support  their  aged\r\n\r\nparents all the time because their own income may  not\r\n\r\nbe   sufficient  to  give  support  and  the   parents\r\n\r\nthemselves feel the same way too. There are many cases\r\n\r\nof  old people in my constituency who feel that it  is\r\n\r\nunfair  for  them to rely entirely on their  children,\r\n\r\nand  I  feel  that  they are quite justified  in  this\r\n\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this problem, I do not think the right answer is\r\n\r\nto  build  more  old  people's homes.  But  would  the\r\n\r\nMinister perhaps consider giving opportunities for the\r\n\r\nable  old  people  to  at  least  be  partially  self-supporting?  The  Member for  Sembawang  made  a  good\r\n\r\nsuggestion yesterday of extending the retirement  age.\r\n\r\nI  would qualify that a little by suggesting that  the\r\n\r\nextension  should be granted not to  everyone  but  to\r\n\r\nthose  whose extension of service will not  jeopardise\r\n\r\nthe  promotion  prospects of the younger  staff  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom this, perhaps in conjunction with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour, part-time jobs could be obtained for them.

They  could be granted a hawker  licence  with\r\n\r\ncertain safeguards, i.e, these licences should not  be\r\n\r\ntransferable and that the old people themselves should\r\n\r\ndo  the  work  rather than delegate the job  to  their\r\n\r\nchildren. In this way, they might be able to earn some\r\n\r\nmoney  for  themselves and help to pay for the  extras\r\n\r\nthey want, while the children themselves could provide\r\n\r\nfor them the accommodation and food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Sir, may I have your indulgence in first\r\n\r\nanswering  the points raised by the Member for  Anson?\r\n\r\nHe has brought up about a dozen points and if I do not\r\n\r\nanswer them all, he will accuse me of victimising him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The award of the Sportsman and Sportswoman of the\r\n\r\nYear  in itself is an effort to raise the standard  of\r\n\r\nsports   in  Singapore.

At least  80%  of\r\n\r\nthe  present  national  squad players  came  from  the\r\n\r\nscheme.  The  responsibility of winning  international\r\n\r\nhonours  lies  within the province of the  controlling\r\n\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NFX was introduced some years' ago but gradually\r\n\r\ndeclined  in popularity. Some of the reasons  for  the\r\n\r\ndecline  may  be due to the unsuitable time  when  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  comes on the TV screen and the radio,  that\r\n\r\nindividuals  tend to be unmotivated  when  alone,  and\r\n\r\nthat  others  would  prefer the  outdoors  and  social\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  exercising in company.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  jogging  and  other free calisthenics  outdoors\r\n\r\nseem  to  have  increased  in  popularity,  simply  by\r\n\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards temples, Government's policy with regard\r\n\r\nto  the allocation of sites for religious institutions\r\n\r\nis  to  reserve adequate sites in each satellite  town\r\n\r\nfor  the  building  of mosques, temples  and  churches\r\n\r\nwhere there is a demonstrated need for such places  of\r\n\r\nworship. For Toa Payoh, the Government has allocated a\r\n\r\nsite  of  about  5,000 sq. ft. to the Hindu  Endowment\r\n\r\nBoard  for a Hindu temple. The Hindu Endowment  Board,\r\n\r\nof  which  the hon. Member for Anson is the  Chairman,\r\n\r\nhas  rejected  in June 1976 the offer on  the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat the area allocated was too small, that the siting\r\n\r\nof  the land was poor, and that the land was shaped in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  way that no proper construction was possible.\r\n\r\nSince  then,  the Hindu Endowment Board  took  up  the\r\n\r\nmatter   with   the  Housing  and  Development   Board\r\n\r\nindependently,  without  any  success.   However,   my\r\n\r\nMinistry has taken up the matter with the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development last month  The  Member  may  be\r\n\r\npleased to know that it has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen decided to allocate a different site with an area\r\n\r\nof 10,000 sq. ft. to the Hindu Endowment Board for the\r\n\r\nconstruction of a Hindu temple at Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware that the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  is charging $8 per sq. ft. for the land at  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  and also that the compensation for the Somerset\r\n\r\nRoad  Hindu Temple has not been settled. I  will  take\r\n\r\nthis up with the Ministry of National Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the temple at Woodlands, the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board has informed my Ministry\r\n\r\nthat the land and the temple thereon were acquired  by\r\n\r\nthe  Board  with vacant possession two  years  ago.  A\r\n\r\nvacant   possession  award  was  paid  to  the  former\r\n\r\nlandowners.  In  November 1975, the caretaker  of  the\r\n\r\ntemple  handed  over  the keys to the  Housing  Board.\r\n\r\nSince  then the premises have been locked, until  some\r\n\r\ntime  in  late January 1977, when another  person  who\r\n\r\nclaimed  to be the new caretaker of the temple shifted\r\n\r\ninto  the  premises  without  the  permission  of  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board. I do not know how he got  in  He  must\r\n\r\nhave  broken the lock. A notice was, therefore, given\r\n\r\nto  him to quit because he was an unauthorised person.\r\n\r\nSubsequently  he vacated the premises.  The  HDB  then\r\n\r\n1st March, 1977\r\n\r\nthat time there was no one in the premises However, my\r\n\r\nMinistry is still looking into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member for Telok Blangah, old people\r\n\r\nwho  have  been  cast  out by their  families,  either\r\n\r\nbecause  their  families are poor  or  their  children\r\n\r\ncannot  provide  for them, can always seek  assistance\r\n\r\nfrom the Social Welfare Department. In cases of severe\r\n\r\nhardship,  they will be referred to certain  voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations for additional assistance in cash and in\r\n\r\nkind  and, wherever possible, old people are  assisted\r\n\r\nto  find  employment.  But most of  them  cannot  work\r\n\r\nbecause of poor health and only some are fit for light\r\n\r\nwork.  Because of this, it is felt that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity for the Government to specially provide jobs\r\n\r\nfor  them. From 1976 up to the end of February  1977,\r\n\r\nthe Social\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department found jobs for 441 welfare  cases,\r\n\r\nincluding residents of the Homes. Of these, 159  were\r\n\r\npublic assistance recipients and 156 were destitutes,\r\n\r\ndisabled or aged persons. I would like to stress  that\r\n\r\nit  should  be the duty of the children to look  after\r\n\r\ntheir  aged parents. In many instances, the old people\r\n\r\nare  not altogether a burden as they can help to  look\r\n\r\nafter the grandchildren or attend to household chores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his suggestion that the old people be given a\r\n\r\nhawker   licence   and  operate   something   like   a\r\n\r\ncooperative, this is a matter for the Ministry of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment to look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised some matters\r\n\r\nabout  the  old  people's home and  the  aged.  Mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit organisations are being encouraged not only to\r\n\r\nlook  into death benefits but to adopt programmes that\r\n\r\nwill  benefit the living as well. A few  of  the  more\r\n\r\nprosperous  ones  with a large reserve  fund  will  be\r\n\r\nstarting old people's homes and they will not need any\r\n\r\nsubsidy.  My Ministry will assist them to set  up  the\r\n\r\nhomes.  Those  old people receiving public  assistance\r\n\r\nwho  are  admitted  to these homes  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nreceive their allowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of extending the age of retirement\r\n\r\nfor  old people from the present 55 years to 60 years.\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  matter  for  the Ministry  of  Labour  to\r\n\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a necessity at this stage to\r\n\r\nhave  a  campaign  at  the  national  level  aimed  at\r\n\r\ninstilling  respect  for  the  aged.  Generally,   our\r\n\r\ncitizens are aware of the need and care for the  aged.\r\n\r\nVarious  Members of this House have already spoken  in\r\n\r\npublic  on  the importance of caring for the  aged  by\r\n\r\ntheir young. The schools are also stressing this point\r\n\r\nin  the  educational programmes I understand there  is\r\n\r\nalso a move to form an association for old people, and\r\n\r\nthis   association   and   other   related   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations  can  work together  towards  instilling\r\n\r\ngreater respect for the aged people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me deal with the Member for Boon Lay.\r\n\r\nYesterday  I have been wrongly accused by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Boon Lay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I forgive him as he is new to this House.

It  is\r\n\r\nobvious that the Member has not done his homework  and\r\n\r\nat  the  same time he does not even know  me  at  all.\r\n\r\nThose Members who are associated with me in one way or\r\n\r\nanother, particularly the Member for Sembawang in this\r\n\r\nHouse, and those outside this House, will know that  I\r\n\r\ndo  take a personal interest in my work. Although I do\r\n\r\nnot  read the Chinese newspapers myself, I can  assure\r\n\r\nthe  Member  that  I am perfectly  aware  of  what  is\r\n\r\nreported  in all newspapers, particularly of  personal\r\n\r\nand  other  tragedies. Members in this House  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  enlighten  the Member for  Boon  Lay  of  my\r\n\r\nconcern  for cases which have been referred to  me  by\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every case of tragedy which comes to our notice,\r\n\r\neither  from MPs, from members of the public  or  from\r\n\r\nnewspapers, the Social Welfare Department investigates\r\n\r\nimmediately.  Where I am aware of  such  cases,  I  do\r\n\r\npersonally  instruct my officials to look  into  them,\r\n\r\ninvestigate,  and then inform me of the action  taken.\r\n\r\nMy  Senior Parliamentary Secretary can vouch for this.\r\n\r\nThe  case  that  was mentioned by the Member, of  the\r\n\r\nmother  and  daughter  who committed  suicide,  is  an\r\n\r\nunfortunate  one.  If they had approached  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department for assistance, then  the  tragedy\r\n\r\nwould not have happened. In cases of genuine tragedies\r\n\r\nand   distress  where  assistance  is  required,   the\r\n\r\nDepartment will render all possible assistance to help\r\n\r\nthem. The Social Welfare Department will also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider  these  cases for public assistance.  We  can\r\n\r\nassist  needy cases and there is no need for a special\r\n\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, there are some who would\r\r\n\r\nrather  get  public sympathy through the press  first.\r\n\r\nThere  are  genuine  cases  of  hardship  which  merit\r\n\r\nsympathy  and  assistance. There are,  however,  other\r\n\r\ncases  which  take  the public for  a  ride  including\r\n\r\ngullible MPs. To quote just one example. A few  months\r\n\r\nback nearly all the newspapers portrayed some children\r\n\r\nbeing evicted from their flat by the authorities.  The\r\n\r\nimpression   given  was  that  the  authorities   were\r\n\r\nuncaring  and  heartless and the family was  suffering\r\n\r\nfrom  poverty and hardship. It was even reported  that\r\n\r\nthe father was jobless and suffering from cancer. As a\r\n\r\nnormal   routine,   the  Social   Welfare   Department\r\n\r\ninvestigated  the  case  and it  was  found  that  the\r\n\r\nparents  were working and had refused to pay the  rent\r\n\r\nand were staying away from home to avoid creditors for\r\n\r\ngambling debts. It was also discovered that, far  from\r\n\r\nsuffering  from cancer, all he had was a boil  on  his\r\n\r\nbuttock.  In  this  case, the money collected  by  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers went to the wrong people. So not only  were\r\n\r\nthe  public  taken  for  a ride  but  the  newspapers,\r\n\r\nincluding the newspaper in which the hon. Member is, I\r\n\r\nunderstand, a director, were also taken for a ride.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to stress, Sir, that people  who  are  in\r\n\r\ndistress  should  not hesitate to contact  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to liaison between the Ministry and other\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  and authorities, there  has  always\r\n\r\nbeen   close   liaison  between  the  Social   Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment and the authorities such as the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board  and  the  PUB.  I  have   already\r\n\r\nmentioned previously in this House that my Ministry is\r\n\r\nsetting up a coordinating committee of officials  from\r\n\r\nvarious Ministries and departments to see what can  be\r\n\r\ndone for these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the hon. Member that I do not\r\n\r\naspire to be a TV star of the stature of Justice  Pao,\r\n\r\nbut  my  Ministry  will continue  to  look  after  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of those in need and to reach out to  prevent\r\n\r\ntragedies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom happening. If Members in this House are aware  of\r\n\r\nany  case  which merits immediate attention  and  feel\r\n\r\nthat intervention is necessary, they only need to pick\r\n\r\nup  the  telephone and speak to me and if they do  not\r\n\r\nknow the telephone number, it is 914111. If the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Boon  Lay should need a sympathetic ear  for  his\r\n\r\njournalistic sensation. I can promise him action if he\r\n\r\nwill  ring up the same number 914111 when there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with\r\n\r\nyour  permission, may I be allowed to say a few  words\r\n\r\non  the  subject  of Hindu temples? In Changi  Village\r\n\r\nwhich is in my constituency there is a Sri Rama Temple\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been  there  for more  than  30  years.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand   that  with  the  Government   development\r\n\r\nprojects going on in Changi, this temple will have  to\r\n\r\nmake  way  for development in the near future.  A  few\r\n\r\ndays ago the Hon. Minister for Finance has stated that\r\n\r\nChangi  Village  will be used as  a  tourist  stopover\r\n\r\npoint  and  that  Changi Prison will be  made  into  a\r\n\r\ntourist attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Social Affairs whether the Sri Rama temple in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency will be allowed to continue to remain  in\r\n\r\nChangi Village as one of the tourist stopover points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, I am not aware of this temple\r\n\r\nin  Changi and I am also not aware that it is going to\r\n\r\nbe  pulled down, or whether it is to be preserved  and\r\n\r\nthus allowed to continue its activities. If the temple\r\n\r\nis allowed to remain there, then it is up to the Board\r\n\r\nof  Management to decide whether or not they  want  to\r\n\r\ninvite tourists to visit it as an attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  is  also involved in  the  work  of  this\r\n\r\nMinistry, I know that the majority of problems that we\r\n\r\ndeal  in  our daily routine come from members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  sometimes  through MPs, or from  journalists.\r\n\r\nWhenever an issue or a problem arises, we look into it\r\n\r\nimmediately  or  send  somebody  to  investigate,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Lay has said that this matter\r\n\r\nhas not received our attention, as though we would not\r\n\r\nwant to help anybody in distress. He even went to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  describing  us as not  being  aware  of  a\r\n\r\ntragedy. I say that everybody has some difficulties at\r\n\r\nhome   and   all  matters  or  problems   have   their\r\n\r\npriorities.  Sometimes it may appear  that  a  problem\r\n\r\npresents a challenge or a lesson or an experience that\r\n\r\neverybody has to undergo. Some can overcome it; but to\r\n\r\nthose  who  cannot, it may seem to be the end  of  the\r\n\r\nroad for them when everything is not lost yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Lay thinks that whenever there\r\n\r\nis  any  problem facing any member of the  public,  we\r\n\r\nmust  immediately go to his aid. I think this  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  way.  When  a newspaper publishes  such  hardship\r\n\r\nstories,  the journalists, of course, report  it  with\r\n\r\ngood  intentions.  We hold nothing  against  them  but\r\n\r\nthere  are  certain things behind such  stories  which\r\n\r\nthey might not be aware of. The publication of news of\r\n\r\na  tragedy in the newspapers will arouse the  sympathy\r\n\r\nof  many kind-hearted people in our society, and those\r\n\r\nin sympathy, particularly charitable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphilanthropists,   would  respond   quickly   to   the\r\n\r\nnewspaper's  appeal  to  come  to  the  aid  of   such\r\n\r\ndistressed  people. It sometimes happen that  when  we\r\n\r\nsend investigators to look into the matter asking them\r\n\r\nto first approach us for help, these people would say,\r\n\r\n\"No.  You  had better not take any action to  help  us\r\n\r\nuntil  the newspapers have published our news so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can get more financial relief from members of  the\r\n\r\npublic.  Then we will contact you for any help.\"  This\r\n\r\nis  a  very  common occurrence. This is a weakness  in\r\n\r\npeople  who want to get more money for the  family  by\r\n\r\ncreating a tragic story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes we have occasion to discuss this with the\r\n\r\njournalists. After establishing the untruth of such  a\r\n\r\nstory,  we  ask the journalists to publish corrections\r\n\r\nin  their newspapers but they refuse because it  might\r\n\r\nreflect a very poor image of the journalists as  being\r\n\r\nharsh  or immoral to such people. That is why we often\r\n\r\nread  such tragic news in the newspapers but  never  a\r\n\r\ncorrection  of the story if there was one. To  publish\r\n\r\ncorrections  to those incorrect cases  would  seem  to\r\n\r\naffect  the  image  of integrity or  morality  of  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  concerned. As Members  of  Parliament,  we\r\n\r\nused to meet with such instances. Of course, when more\r\n\r\ngenuine  cases  are  brought  out  people  would   not\r\n\r\ncriticise  us  for  what we do, but  whatever  dubious\r\n\r\ncases  that we have uncovered, the people would  close\r\n\r\ntheir eyes and regard us as being immoral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, there is always some difficulty with\r\n\r\nevery family. How do we educate our people to overcome\r\n\r\nthe difficulty? I feel that if there is any problem or\r\n\r\ndifficulty, it should be taken as a challenge  to  the\r\n\r\nfamily concerned, as a training or testing ground  for\r\n\r\nthem to steel their spirit as well as their ability to\r\n\r\nsurvive. The strong-willed will overcome it while  the\r\n\r\nfeeble  will succumb to charitable aid. So, as Members\r\n\r\nof  Parliament,  we should understand this  spirit  of\r\n\r\nstruggle for life and try to teach the people the idea\r\n\r\nof self-reliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has mentioned Justice Pao. Actually he is\r\n\r\na symbol of an honest and a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\njust  judge.  It is a legendary story in which  he  is\r\n\r\nbeing deified. Even in the film that we see, one  side\r\n\r\nof  his face is black and the other white, and between\r\n\r\nhis  eye  brows  there  is  a  mystical  symbol  of  a\r\n\r\ntalisman. The black side of his face signifies that he\r\n\r\nis  also a judge in Hades, so that while he judges the\r\n\r\nliving world he can also judge the spirit of man after\r\n\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard stories that even the emperor\r\n\r\ngave him a regal sword authorizing him to cut off  the\r\n\r\nheads  of  high  officials or close relatives  of  the\r\n\r\nemperor without prior decree of the emperor if such  a\r\n\r\nperson was adjudged to have committed a serious  error\r\n\r\nor  offence. We see Justice Pao hearing cases  in  his\r\n\r\ncourt  and easily cut off the prisoner's head to  mete\r\n\r\nout   justice.  This  never  happens  in  our  present\r\n\r\nsituation. Here, we even have heated debate over  such\r\n\r\na  small matter as \"barbed wire\". But Justice Pao  was\r\n\r\nnever   able   to  solve  the  problems  on   economy,\r\n\r\nemployment construction and other matters of  national\r\n\r\ninterest. I feel that the present MPs are more capable\r\n\r\nthan  Justice  Pao who was only able to  preside  over\r\n\r\nfictitious cases. Our MPs are more capable than  these\r\n\r\nthings;  they  can also take part in  nation  building\r\n\r\nbesides other things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify matters today by posing two\r\n\r\nquestions.  The  first question is whether  we  should\r\n\r\nencourage the habit of reliance on others? The  second\r\n\r\nquestion is whether we should encourage the people  to\r\n\r\nbe  self-reliant in order to be able to help  or  look\r\n\r\nafter themselves?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  let me first say that in  my  dealings\r\n\r\nwith the Hon. Minister for Social Affairs I found  him\r\n\r\nto  be  an amiable person. In fact, I had the pleasure\r\n\r\nof  being  his constituent because I was  residing  in\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang before I shifted to Marine Vista. I also\r\n\r\nhad  the pleasure of working very closely with him  on\r\n\r\nsports   promotion.  Therefore, when   I   heard   my\r\n\r\ncolleague's remark that he is such a heartless person,\r\n\r\nI thought it was a bit of an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverstatement.  I  also  found  that  the   Minister's\r\n\r\npleasantness  seems to have sieved down  his  Ministry\r\n\r\nbecause my dealings with his officials have also given\r\n\r\nme  extremely pleasant experiences and I have had  the\r\n\r\npleasure  of receiving excellent service.  However,  I\r\n\r\nfound  that the counter attack by the Minister on  the\r\n\r\nMember for Boon Lay was also a bit harsh, Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nseriousness of the matter may have really provoked him\r\n\r\ninto  choosing words which, to my mind,  can  mar  his\r\n\r\npleasantness.  But  if  it is really  true  that  this\r\n\r\nproblem  had gone to the extent where the  Member  for\r\n\r\nBoon Lay being a person of position and power -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Encik Mansor, I am sure the Member for\r\n\r\nBoon Lay can defend himself.

The Minister had  the  whole\r\n\r\nnight  to  think over what I said. Today he,  together\r\n\r\nwith his Parliamentary Secretary have joined hands  to\r\n\r\ncounter  attack me, and they fired a broadside.  So  I\r\n\r\nwill   now  take  the  opportunity  to  make   a   few\r\n\r\nclarifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Minister should have replied to my points\r\n\r\nwhen I said that the main function of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs was to look after the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But  the  Minister dealt  with  sports  first\r\n\r\ninstead of welfare. That means he was not paying  much\r\n\r\nattention  to welfare work. He has paid more attention\r\n\r\nto  football  and  sports. He has got  his  priorities\r\n\r\nwrong. The next point is that it has been said that  I\r\n\r\nhave described him as a man with a stony heart. I  was\r\n\r\nnot  describing him personally. What I was  trying  to\r\n\r\nsay was that he was so occupied with other things that\r\n\r\nhe  did  not  pay  adequate attention to  the  welfare\r\n\r\naspect  of  his work. I am not saying that  he  is  by\r\n\r\ncharacter a man with a stony heart. What I was  trying\r\n\r\nto  say  was that he might have appeared not  to  have\r\n\r\npaid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadequate attention to welfare work in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking about the white side and black side of\r\n\r\nthe  face of Justice Pao, as far as I am aware, there\r\n\r\nis  only  one  colour on the face of Justice  Pao.  In\r\n\r\nfact, we can look into this further. I hope that after\r\n\r\nI  have  said this, the Minister and his Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary will not use the regal sword against me.

Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister give some facts and figures to indicate  that\r\n\r\nafter  this reorganisation what the Registry has  done\r\n\r\nso  far in respect of promotional and educational work\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the cooperative movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea of a Cooperative training centre to be\r\n\r\nset  up  by the Registry is a wise one. I am  sure  it\r\n\r\nwill   be   welcomed   by   the  various   cooperative\r\n\r\norganisations. In fact, this training centre  is  long\r\n\r\noverdue.  But what I want to know is where  will  this\r\n\r\ncooperative training centre be located, when  will  it\r\n\r\nbe in operation, and who will be in charge of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a fact that when members of trade unions\r\n\r\naffiliated  to the NTUC are selected for seminars  and\r\n\r\ncourses conducted abroad and locally, they are granted\r\n\r\nspecial  leave to attend these seminars  and  courses.\r\n\r\nThis  is  in  a way good in promoting trade  unionism.\r\n\r\nEven cooperative societies were given this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivilege many years ago. But now I gather that  when\r\n\r\ncooperators go for courses or seminars either  abroad\r\n\r\nor locally, they are now not entitled to this special\r\n\r\nleave.  Why is this so? I wonder whether the Minister\r\n\r\nwill  consider  recommending  the  granting  of  this\r\n\r\nspecial leave for participants who go for cooperative\r\n\r\ntraining.  This  will  in a way help  develop  better\r\n\r\ncooperators  in  the  various cooperative  movements.\r\n\r\nSir, besides being a Registry, what encouragement and\r\n\r\nmoral   support  does  the  Registry  of  Cooperative\r\n\r\nSocieties   give  to  ensure  that  the   cooperative\r\n\r\nsocieties  function properly? Sir, I would also  like\r\n\r\nto   know  how  many  cooperative  societies  are  in\r\n\r\nexistence  in Singapore. How many of them are  really\r\n\r\nactive?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Registry of Cooperative Societies have a\r\n\r\nproper  set of rules to run the various cooperatives?\r\n\r\nIf  it  has,  how  is  it that  some  societies  have\r\n\r\nfinancial  problems?  I  suggest  that  the  Registry\r\n\r\nshould  play  a greater role in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious   societies  and  ensure   that   a   healthy\r\n\r\nenvironment exists. Even in the case of the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment Officers' Cooperative Housing Society,  we\r\n\r\ndo  not know whether or not it is really functioning.\r\n\r\nIf  members request for a refund of their  money,  no\r\n\r\nreply is given. I do not know what they are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson is correct in saying that the Registry  of\r\n\r\nCooperative Societies has now been reorganised as the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Cooperative Societies and Mutual  Benefit\r\n\r\nOrganisations.  The  earlier  reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\nRegistry,  which  he has referred  to,  involved  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of two sections, one on administration and\r\n\r\naudit and the other on promotion and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the promotional and educational work\r\n\r\nundertaken  by  the Registry for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\ncooperative  movement, the hon. Member  may  wish  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  the Registry has conducted  a  number  of\r\n\r\ncourses  for  the staff and officials of  cooperative\r\n\r\nsocieties. Last year, a basic book-keeping course was\r\n\r\norganised  for 63 cooperators. A similar course  will\r\n\r\nbe organised next month\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  officials of Malay cooperative societies.  There\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  a  basic audit  course  for  internal\r\n\r\nauditors.  The  Registry also  conducts  co-operative\r\n\r\nstudy tours for secondary school pupils and publishes\r\n\r\npamphlets  and bulletins on cooperative matters.  The\r\n\r\npromotional work of the Registry is primarily one  of\r\n\r\ngiving   advice  and  guidance  to  individuals   and\r\n\r\norganisations    intending   to   form    cooperative\r\n\r\nsocieties.  Last year 14 groups were given assistance\r\n\r\nby  the  Registry to set up cooperative societies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Four more cooperative societies have  been\r\n\r\nset up as a result of consultation and discussion led\r\n\r\nby  the  Registry  staff. Several courses  are  being\r\n\r\nplanned  by the Registry to fulfil particular  social\r\n\r\nroles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the proposed Cooperative Training Centre, my\r\n\r\nMinistry is re-examining this project in view of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty in forming the apex cooperative body which\r\n\r\nwas  supposed  to  take over this project  after  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has set it up. Originally, we intended  to\r\n\r\nestablish the centre at the Command and Staff College\r\n\r\nbuilding  at  Fort Canning. But since  this  building\r\n\r\nwill   be   allocated   to  another   Ministry,   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this project will be delayed.  This\r\n\r\nproject  is  also  tied up with the revision  of  the\r\n\r\ncooperative legislation wherein provisions  are  made\r\n\r\nto  ensure  the viability of this project and  unless\r\n\r\nthere is support for the project and the formation of\r\n\r\nan  apex  body to run it, it may not be  prudent  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to do the ground work for the  apex  body\r\n\r\nwhich  may  not  materialise.  In  the  interim   the\r\n\r\nRegistry  will continue to run courses on cooperative\r\n\r\nsubjects  on an ad hoc basis in cooperation with  the\r\n\r\ncooperative societies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also referred to the granting\r\n\r\nof  special leave for cooperators to attend  training\r\n\r\ncourses  and  seminars. I am afraid that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for the employers to consider. As far as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is  concerned,  leave  is  granted   for\r\n\r\nrecognised seminars and training courses. I do  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  hon.  Member  that  this  is  one  way  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  cooperators  and  thus  helping  the\r\n\r\ncooperative  movement to progress. I would  certainly\r\n\r\nlike to see employers in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate  sector encourage their staff who are involved\r\n\r\nin cooperative work to develop themselves by attending\r\n\r\nseminars and courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Sir, there are 78 cooperative societies\r\n\r\nin  existence.  The  number of  cooperative  societies\r\n\r\nbelie the fact that the cooperative movement is not an\r\n\r\nactive   one,   since  most  of  the  new  cooperative\r\n\r\nsocieties  serve  a  large segment of  the  population\r\n\r\nespecially  those  formed and run  by  the  NTUC.  The\r\n\r\nRegistry over the last few years had been pruning down\r\n\r\nthe  cooperative societies. During the period 1972-76,\r\n\r\n21 cooperative societies were deregistered. During the\r\n\r\nsame period the Registry completed the liquidation  of\r\n\r\n65  cooperative societies. This is part of the process\r\n\r\nof  consolidation of the cooperative movement  started\r\n\r\nin 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the hon. Member, all\r\n\r\ncooperative  societies operate under  the  Cooperative\r\n\r\nSocieties  Act and Rules. Besides this, they  have  to\r\n\r\noperate  within  the ambit of their own  constitutions\r\n\r\nand  by  laws as approved by the Registry and modified\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time according to the requirements  of\r\n\r\ntheir membership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial problems faced by the cooperative\r\n\r\nsocieties are usually the result of bad management  or\r\n\r\npoor  judgment  in  embarking upon financial  ventures\r\n\r\nwhich  prove  to  be  non-viable. The  Registry  gives\r\n\r\nadvice  and  assistance  to cooperative  societies  on\r\n\r\nfinancial  matters.  But  decisions  with  regard   to\r\n\r\ninvestments which are allowed by law are made  by  the\r\n\r\nmembers  themselves.  By and large, most  cooperative\r\n\r\nsocieties are financially healthy. The hon. Member  is\r\n\r\nobviously   referring  to  one  or   two   cooperative\r\n\r\nsocieties which are facing financial difficulties  due\r\n\r\nto  certain  projects  which failed  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances beyond their control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The   handful   of\r\n\r\nprobation  and aftercare officers of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial Affairs, one of whom I know personally, have by\r\n\r\ntradition   and  dedication  continued  without   much\r\n\r\npublicity   in   shouldering   responsibilities    for\r\n\r\nrehabilitating  offenders  and  drug  addicts  in  our\r\n\r\ncommunity.  With the increasing problem of drug  abuse\r\n\r\non  our  hands,  the  burden of  rehabilitating  these\r\n\r\noffenders will fall on the shoulders of these officers\r\n\r\nand the volunteer probation officers. I would like  to\r\n\r\nknow, Sir, if the Minister could inform the House  how\r\n\r\nmany   such  volunteer  probation  officers  are   now\r\n\r\nattached to the Probation and Aftercare Service of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Social Affairs, and what  has  been  the\r\n\r\ndropout  rate  during the past five years?

The community  probation  service\r\n\r\nwas  launched  in  1971. Between 1971  and  1976,  797\r\n\r\npersons   applied   to   become  volunteer   probation\r\n\r\nofficers.   290  of  them  or  36.4%  were  ultimately\r\n\r\nselected. The Department is highly selective in  order\r\n\r\nto  preserve the standard of work, image and integrity\r\n\r\nof the service. Up to the end of last year, only 58 or\r\n\r\n20%  have  opted out of the programme, an  average  of\r\n\r\n3.3% a year. Of these, 17 resigned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  their  own accord because of personal commitments;\r\n\r\n39  were  found unsuitable and two died. 72  volunteer\r\n\r\nprobation   officers  have  been  in   the   community\r\n\r\nprobation  service  for  more  than  five  years.  The\r\n\r\ndropout rate is, therefore, minimal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Bedok that incentive\r\n\r\nschemes are necessary to sustain the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nvolunteer  probation officers. But it is not desirable\r\n\r\nto grant monetary incentives like transport allowances\r\n\r\nand  out-of-pocket  expenses as  it  will  defeat  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  voluntarism among our citizens.  The  best\r\n\r\nincentives are the satisfaction of a job well done and\r\n\r\nthe  recognition  given for such  voluntary  work.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry intends to issue commendation certificates to\r\n\r\nvolunteers who show dedication, continued interest and\r\n\r\nsuccess in voluntary work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year the Department proposes to embark on\r\n\r\nanother  two neighbourhood projects in Bedok New  Town\r\n\r\nand  Marine  Parade.  While these projects  have  been\r\n\r\nfound  useful  in  involving the  local  community  in\r\n\r\nrehabilitating  offenders in their midst,  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  with the limited resources to  take  on  too\r\n\r\nmany constituencies or neighbourhoods at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nMinister's   reply,  I  beg  leave  to   withdraw   my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (4), subhead BCA 1101.

I\r\n\r\nunderstand that some of the Indian Muslims who have  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  dealings in this court find it  difficult  at\r\n\r\ntimes to communicate with the Malay kathi. Perhaps the\r\n\r\nDepartment  would not mind providing a  Tamil-speaking\r\n\r\nkathi  to  solve the problem. Could the Minister  look\r\n\r\ninto this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nmarriage  is one of the most important events  in  the\r\n\r\nlife  of  man.  This  is a natural  inclination.  Even\r\n\r\nanimals  have  this instinct. The only  difference  is\r\n\r\nthat  as human beings we are guided by rules. Our mind\r\n\r\nforms the basis of our ability to strike a balance. We\r\n\r\nare  then  able  to recognise what is permissible  and\r\n\r\nwhat  is  forbidden. Permissible cohabitation  in  the\r\n\r\neyes  of Islam and other religions is through marriage\r\n\r\nor  wedlock.  Cohabitation between a man and  a  woman\r\n\r\noutside  marriage is known as adultery. Sigmund  Freud\r\n\r\nwho   laid   much  stress  on  the  significance   and\r\n\r\noverwhelming  urge of sex in human nature  has  caused\r\n\r\nmany  people to hold the view that one of the  factors\r\n\r\nfor  the unbalanced world situation at present can  be\r\n\r\nattributed  to  sex.  At present,  we  find  that  the\r\n\r\nproblem  pertaining to sex has become more  widespread\r\n\r\nso much so that it is causing anxiety both in the West\r\n\r\nand in the East. Morality has been adversely affected.\r\n\r\nIncidence of VD is rising. Some people have even  been\r\n\r\nsaying, \"Why should we own a cow if we can find  cow's\r\n\r\nmilk  everywhere?\" In fact, this figure of  speech  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from what the Member for Telok Blangah  has\r\n\r\nsaid.  There are women who totally reject the idea  of\r\n\r\nmarriage but continue to cohabit with men after taking\r\n\r\nsteps  to  ensure that they would not become pregnant.\r\n\r\nThey  would  say. \"Why should we trouble ourselves  by\r\n\r\nbecoming pregnant and bear children?\" They say this as\r\n\r\nif  they have forgotten that by the grace of God  they\r\n\r\nwere  delivered unto this world by their mothers.  The\r\n\r\ncourse  of  pregnancy and child bearing involves  much\r\n\r\nsacrifice on the part of the mother or wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us certainly want our marriage to last.\r\n\r\nIn  the Al-Quran it is stated that the one thing which\r\n\r\nGod  allows  but  dislikes is  divorce  of  a  married\r\n\r\ncouple.   This   is  because  divorce   will   present\r\n\r\ndifficulties particularly to the children. I hope this\r\n\r\nwill not be made an excuse by those who are afraid  to\r\n\r\nget  married.  In  this connection, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nexpress  my  appreciation for the  good  work  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Shariah  Court  which  from  time  to  time\r\n\r\nsucceeds in reducing the rate of divorce among members\r\n\r\nof  the Muslim community in Singapore. I only hope and\r\n\r\npray  that while the two parties are negotiating  with\r\n\r\nthe  Shariah  Court as an intermediary, no undesirable\r\n\r\nevents take place. What I mean is that while the Court\r\n\r\nis trying to resolve the divorce cases, it should keep\r\n\r\ntrack of every case in great detail to ensure that  no\r\n\r\ndelays  are caused as this may result in either  party\r\n\r\ncommitting  an  act which is forbidden. For  instance,\r\n\r\nshould  quarrels develop the feeling of hatred on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  husband may cause him to  do  something\r\n\r\ndrastic against the wife. Or what is worse is that  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  third party involved, then an adulterous\r\n\r\nrelationship which is deplorable may develop. In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, I think it would do well for the  Ministry\r\n\r\nto issue a statement for the benefit of members of the\r\n\r\npublic  informing  them  as to  which  authority  they\r\n\r\nshould   submit  their  appeal  to  should   they   be\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with the decision of the Shariah  Court.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, can they appeal to the Singapore Muslim\r\n\r\nReligious  Council (MUIS), or is there  any  board  of\r\n\r\nappeal  for  this  purpose? It is a common  occurrence\r\n\r\nthat  whenever  a  quarrel  develops,  the  wife   who\r\n\r\nconstitutes the weaker party is usually victimised  by\r\n\r\nthe  husband. Bruises on various parts of the body are\r\n\r\nusually  cited  as strong grounds for divorce  by  the\r\n\r\nwife.  This  is  usually  made  the  main  point   for\r\n\r\nconsideration by those concerned. There may  be  cases\r\n\r\nin  which  a doctor who is called to examine  a  woman\r\n\r\ncannot  determine  whether or  not  the  bruises  were\r\n\r\ncaused  by assault by the husband. In such cases  will\r\n\r\nthe  Court  rely on the doctor's evidence or  will  it\r\n\r\nform its own conclusion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope such matters as I have mentioned will be\r\n\r\ncarefully studied so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  will  always  be  good  relations  between  the\r\n\r\nShariah  Court and members of the public,  a  kind  of\r\n\r\nrelationship whereby hopes can be turned into  reality\r\n\r\nor  the sanctity of the institution of marriage can be\r\n\r\nmaintained. Whether a marriage can last or whether  it\r\n\r\nbreaks  after  a  quarrel has  developed,  every  case\r\n\r\nshould  be  dealt  with tactfully and  in  the  wisest\r\n\r\npossible manner in accordance with the tenets  of  the\r\n\r\nIslamic religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Shariah Court has a\r\n\r\nstanding arrangement made with the High Court for  the\r\n\r\nuse of interpreters when dealing with Tamil-Muslim and\r\n\r\nPunjabi-Muslim  cases.  The  number  of  Indian-Muslim\r\n\r\ncases  handled by the Shariah Court each year is  very\r\n\r\nsmall and most of them can speak Malay. In 1975, there\r\n\r\nwere  only four cases. In 1976, there were only  three\r\n\r\ncases.   Therefore,  this  number  does  not   justify\r\n\r\nemploying a Tamil-speaking kathi to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThe  Shariah  Court  will continue with  this  present\r\n\r\npractice  of  using Tamil interpreters from  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt  when  dealing  with Indian-Muslims  who  cannot\r\n\r\nspeak  Malay.  But we intend to have a  Tamil-speaking\r\n\r\nNaib Kathi or Assistant Kathi to officiate at marriage\r\n\r\nceremonies  and  to deal with cases  involving  Indian\r\n\r\nMuslims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the point raised by the Member for Kolam\r\n\r\nAyer,  firstly, I would like to thank the  Member  for\r\n\r\npraising  the  efforts of the Shariah Court  to  bring\r\n\r\ndown   the   number  of  divorces  among  Muslims   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  Shariah Court  has  a  difficult  but\r\n\r\nchallenging  task in dealing with various  matrimonial\r\n\r\ndisputes  relating to marriage, divorce, the  division\r\n\r\nof  properties  and the payment of dowry,  maintenance\r\n\r\nand consolation gifts (matta'ah).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in 1958, the Shariah Court has\r\n\r\nbeen  quite successful in dealing with disputed  cases\r\n\r\nof  divorce  and has managed to cut down  the  divorce\r\n\r\nrate  from  around 50% before 1958 to 10% at  present.\r\n\r\nThis  is the lowest divorce rate among Muslims in this\r\n\r\npart  of the world. It must be recognised that dealing\r\n\r\nwith marital disputes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvolving couples who disagree with each other  is  by\r\n\r\nno means an easy task. The Kathi and the Muslim social\r\n\r\ncase  workers  furthermore have to  work  within  the\r\n\r\nambit   of   the  religious  laws.  So   far   nothing\r\n\r\ncontradictory  to religious laws ever occurred  during\r\n\r\nthe  conciliation  or compromise between  the  parties\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Also  every  effort  is  made   by   these\r\n\r\nofficials to settle cases as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In matrimonial disputes, complaints of assault are\r\n\r\nmade  by  one  party, usually the  female  party.  The\r\n\r\ncomplainant  will  be asked by the  Shariah  Court  to\r\n\r\nlodge a report with the police and to go for a medical\r\n\r\ncheck-up.  The  case  is then referred  to  the  Civil\r\n\r\nCourt.  Subsequently, in the divorce  proceedings  the\r\n\r\nset of evidence obtained from the Civil Court relating\r\n\r\nto  the  charges of assault together with the  medical\r\n\r\nevidence  available  will be used in  considering  the\r\n\r\ncase by the Shariah Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is provision under the Administration of\r\n\r\nMuslim  Law  Act for appeals to be made to  an  Appeal\r\n\r\nBoard  constituted from time to time by the  President\r\n\r\nof the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura. Any person who is\r\n\r\nnot  satisfied with the decision of the Shariah  Court\r\n\r\nmay  appeal to the Appeal Board. The Appeal Board  may\r\n\r\nconfirm or reverse or vary the decision of the  Court,\r\n\r\nand  exercise any such powers as the Court could  have\r\n\r\nexercised,  making such order as the  Court  ought  to\r\n\r\nhave  made  or  order a retrial. The decision  of  the\r\n\r\nAppeal Board is final,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

In  recent  years,  the   Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department has promoted a scheme  to  enable\r\n\r\nthose  under relief aid to get employment. This  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  measure.  It  will not only reduce  Government's\r\n\r\nburden  of relief aid but also enable those recipients\r\n\r\nto  increase their income to enjoy a better life.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said that last year the Department  had\r\n\r\nhelped  about 400 people of old age to get employment.\r\n\r\nThis is a very good move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have received some complaints that the\r\n\r\nofficers  in the Social Welfare Department in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith these people have been too hasty or peremptory in\r\n\r\ntheir attitude. They stopped the payment of the relief\r\n\r\naid  to such people before the time was ripe and  even\r\n\r\nbefore   they   could  get  any  employment.   In   my\r\n\r\nconstituency  there is a 53 year-old woman  who  lives\r\n\r\nwith  her  mother who is 73 years old.  They  have  no\r\n\r\nchildren to support them, as a daughter had moved  out\r\n\r\nupon  her  marriage.  She was  then  receiving  relief\r\n\r\nassistance  at  $40  per month. The  officers  in  the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department found that the 53  year-old\r\n\r\nwoman  is still healthy physically and advised her  to\r\n\r\nseek  a job or the Department could help her to get  a\r\n\r\njob.  She took their advice. But before she could  get\r\n\r\nany  employment, they cancelled her public assistance.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, who is going to support these\r\n\r\ntwo  aged women? This instance shows that the officers\r\n\r\nhave  been too hasty and the Social Welfare Department\r\n\r\nhas  been  too presumptuous. I can supply the Minister\r\n\r\nwith  the  details of this case, so that he  can  look\r\n\r\ninto it. I would like to say that there are also other\r\n\r\nsimilar cases. I have to mention this case here hoping\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister and also the Senior  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  would pay more attention to it and  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  officers  in the Department  will  be  more\r\n\r\ncareful in such matters in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I have often been told\r\n\r\nthat   some  of  the  girls  from  these  homes  after\r\n\r\nrehabilitation are repeatedly sent back to the welfare\r\n\r\nhomes  for  the same offences, like running away  from\r\n\r\nhome,   mixing   with   bad  company,   indulging   in\r\n\r\nundesirable  acts, etc. Why is this so?

I gather  that  many\r\n\r\ncases   of  family  disputes  are  referred  to   this\r\n\r\nCounselling and Advice Section. The cases take a  long\r\n\r\ntime to settle, and some even take a year, so much  so\r\n\r\nthat  some  fail to resolve the family disputes.  This\r\n\r\nsection  is  indeed a very important one. It  is  this\r\n\r\nsection  which  decides either  the  family  lives  in\r\n\r\nharmony or break up. I feel this section cannot afford\r\n\r\nto  delay  the  settling of welfare  cases.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  this section is running short of officers  or\r\n\r\nthe  officers themselves have to be given  proper  and\r\n\r\nintensive training either locally or abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that some of the offices of the Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department at Pearl's Hill are badly  housed.\r\n\r\nThere  are cubicles with wooden partitions which  look\r\n\r\nlike dungeons, and the atmosphere is uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any private discussion going on in one room can be\r\n\r\nheard  in  the  other.

There  is  one  case  in  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board Estate in Punggol. A certain  family\r\n\r\nwas  receiving about $91 a month in public  assistance\r\n\r\nallowance.   The   woman  has   three   children   but\r\n\r\nunfortunately  her husband left her. So  she  took  on\r\n\r\nsome  small  jobs. This was discovered by  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department  and  as  a  result,  the   public\r\n\r\nassistance was withdrawn. I believe this is a bit  too\r\n\r\nharsh  because the small allowance could  only  enable\r\n\r\nthis  family to live, if I can term it, from  hand  to\r\n\r\nmouth.

In\r\n\r\nthis  respect, would  not  the  Minister  for  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs  consider sympathetically the plight  of  such\r\n\r\nrecipients,  especially those who have to pay  rentals\r\n\r\nto  the Housing Board for the flats they live in?  The\r\n\r\nrental  for  a one-room improved flat today  is  about\r\n\r\n$37.50.

He  has\r\n\r\naccused  our  staff of handling the case in  a  rather\r\n\r\nhasty  manner. If it were so, I apologise and ask  him\r\n\r\nto give us the details of the case so that we can send\r\n\r\nsomebody to look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the points made by the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\nIn  1976  a  total  of  400 girls were  discharged  or\r\n\r\nparoled  from the Social Welfare Girls' Home. Only  43\r\n\r\ngirls or 10% were readmitted. Many of these girls were\r\n\r\nrecalled   because  of  an  infringement   of   parole\r\n\r\nconditions, such as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she shall not involve herself in activities\r\n\r\ndetrimental to her work;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she shall not frequent or work in bars;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she shall not change her address and employment\r\n\r\nwithout the prior knowledge and consent of her  after-care officer;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That she shall take instruction from her after-care\r\n\r\nofficers when given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  girls were therefore readmitted for reasons other\r\n\r\nthan  that  which has precipitated the admission  into\r\n\r\nthe  Home  originally. In many cases,  readmission  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to enhance the rehabilitation process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department has recently\r\n\r\nundertaken a reorganisation of this Girls' Home.  This\r\n\r\nis  to effect better classification and segregation of\r\n\r\nthe girls according to their behaviour and the kind of\r\n\r\ncare  or  rehabilitation required by  each  individual\r\n\r\ngirl. Rehabilitation programme within the institutions\r\n\r\nwas   also  reviewed.  Programmes  to  inculcate  more\r\n\r\ndiscipline  and  for  greater  character-building  and\r\n\r\ncitizenship were introduced. Where it appeared that a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngirl  could no longer benefit from academic schooling,\r\n\r\ntraining  for  skills  or for work  discipline  in  an\r\n\r\nindustrial  setting was provided. Thus a work  release\r\n\r\nscheme  has  been introduced in Toa Payoh Girls'  Home\r\n\r\nwhere girls who have more adequate programmes and show\r\n\r\ngood  behaviour  go out to work daily in  an  approved\r\n\r\nfactory. The girls are encouraged to continue  working\r\n\r\nin   the  particular  factory  where  there  is   good\r\n\r\nsupervision over them on their discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mount Emily Girls' Home factory assembly work is\r\n\r\ncontinuing.   This  provides  the   girls   with   the\r\n\r\ndiscipline for working in factory settings.  They  are\r\n\r\nencouraged  to continue in such occupations  on  their\r\n\r\ndischarge.  Apart from more discipline being  stressed\r\n\r\nin  training programmes, more interesting  and  varied\r\n\r\neducational and recreational programmes are also being\r\n\r\nintroduced to produce mentally and physically  healthy\r\n\r\nyoung persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that more trained staff will be\r\n\r\ndeployed  on  counselling  programmes  for  girls   in\r\n\r\nresidential  institutions in the new  financial  year.\r\n\r\nFamily disputes, whether they are between parents  and\r\n\r\nchildren  or  between marital parents, are  often  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  relationship problems. These  problems  in\r\n\r\nturn  are caused by personality conflicts. Such  cases\r\n\r\nrequire  a considerable amount of counselling  over  a\r\n\r\nlong period of time. Reconciliation is often temporary\r\n\r\nand  problems erupt again each time a family  faces  a\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department is aware of the\r\n\r\nimportance of this Counselling and Advice Section  and\r\n\r\nattempts  are  being made to upgrade the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof  the  work  of  this section. The section  will  be\r\n\r\nstaffed  with higher grade trained staff  in  the  new\r\n\r\nfinancial  year. One staff member will be leaving  for\r\n\r\nspecial training in marital counselling in the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  shortly,  and the second  phase  of  the  in-service training programme on counselling for staff of\r\n\r\nthe section has begun on 15th March this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps have already been taken to extend the office\r\n\r\nspace  on  the  ground  floor of  the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment. The extension\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  will  enable  the Department to  make  available\r\n\r\ninterviewing rooms so that interviews can be conducted\r\n\r\nin  privacy.  Unnecessary wooden  partitions  will  be\r\n\r\nremoved so that the staff may carry out their work  in\r\n\r\na more comfortable atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the points made by the Member for Delta, under\r\n\r\nthe  public  assistance scheme  all  recipients  where\r\n\r\npossible,  including  the handicapped  and  aged,  are\r\n\r\nencouraged and assisted to take on part-time  jobs  to\r\n\r\nsupplement their public assistance allowance  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  need  not  entirely be dependent  on  Government\r\n\r\nwelfare  relief. However, there has to be a  limit  to\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of  income  that  the  public  assistance\r\n\r\nrecipient  is  allowed  to  retain,  otherwise  public\r\n\r\nassistance allowance will be taken by these recipients\r\n\r\nas  a  supplementary income and it will also encourage\r\n\r\nthem  to  stay on public assistance allowance  for  as\r\n\r\nlong as possible. Every encouragement will be given to\r\n\r\nassist public assistance recipients to try to be self-dependent  where  possible. The  criteria  for  public\r\n\r\nassistance  are stringent and those who are  able  but\r\n\r\nunwilling   to  work  are  disqualified  from   public\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Self-Employment Assistance Scheme, a self-help\r\n\r\nproject,   was  implemented  by  the  Social   Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment  in  February  1977.  This  is  to  provide\r\n\r\ninterest-free  loans to help those in  poor  financial\r\n\r\ncircumstances  to  stand on  their  own  feet.  It  is\r\n\r\nfinanced  from  a charity fund. The public  assistance\r\n\r\nvote is not used for this project. The Self-Employment\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme  is to cater specially  for  public\r\n\r\nassistance  recipients  to enable  them  to  be  self-supporting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the points raised by the Member for Punggol.\r\n\r\nI  have mentioned earlier that there has not been much\r\n\r\nchange  in  the  consumer price index since  the  last\r\n\r\nreview  to  merit  a further review of  the  rates  of\r\n\r\npublic assistance. Under the public assistance scheme,\r\n\r\na recipient with a wife is allowed, in addition to his\r\n\r\npublic  assistance  allowance of  $66  per  month,  to\r\n\r\nretain  an  increased income of up to $15  per  month.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  mean test he gets another  $15  per  month\r\n\r\nunder a work incentive credit system. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$30 is disregarded in the assessment of the quantum of\r\n\r\npublic   assistance   allowance  payable.   Also,   an\r\n\r\nadditional  disability allowance of $10 per  month  is\r\n\r\npayable  to  a  head of a household who  is  certified\r\n\r\npermanently   disabled.  Fares  are  also   given   to\r\n\r\nrecipients  who need to attend Government  clinics  or\r\n\r\nhospitals for treatment. Public assistance recipients,\r\n\r\nparticularly   the   aged,  in  addition   to   public\r\n\r\nassistance, are also receiving in cash and  kind  from\r\n\r\ncharitable bodies and voluntary organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever possible, the Department also helps to find\r\n\r\njobs  for  the public assistance recipients  or  their\r\n\r\nfamilies so that they can be self-sufficient and  will\r\n\r\nnot  have to depend on welfare aid. The Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment is therefore unable to assist further  with\r\n\r\nthe   payment   of   rentals  to   public   assistance\r\n\r\nrecipients. Recipients, where possible, are encouraged\r\n\r\nto  help themselves as Government alone is not able to\r\n\r\nprovide  adequately  for  all  the  needs  of   public\r\n\r\nassistance  recipients. For 1976  the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment disbursed $3.6 million in public assistance\r\n\r\nallowance to a monthly average of 6,640 families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am very grateful to the\r\n\r\nSenior  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nSocial Affairs for his kind reply.

A\r\n\r\ncreche is mainly to help working mothers with children\r\n\r\nto  go  out  and  work. This service is of  particular\r\n\r\nassistance  to wage earning parents. This  is  a  very\r\n\r\ngood  service provided by the Department.  However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister two questions.  First,\r\n\r\nwill  his  Department consider the  setting  up  of  a\r\n\r\ncreche  at  Marsiling in Woodlands  which  is  in  the\r\n\r\nSembawang   Constituency,  because  there   are   many\r\n\r\nfactories   in  this  big  satellite  town   and   the\r\n\r\npopulation is also very big. The creche will  help  to\r\n\r\nease the burden of the housewives when they go out  to\r\n\r\nwork. Second, why has the number of staff at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreches been greatly reduced? Is it because of a  need\r\n\r\nto  reduce expenditure, or is there any other  reason?\r\n\r\nIf  the  reason  is  good, maybe  it  would  be  quite\r\n\r\nacceptable.  But the children need adequate  care  and\r\n\r\nthe  service  at  the  creches will  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nchildren are safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if my\r\n\r\nmemory serves me right, the Ministry of Social Affairs\r\n\r\nat one time spoke very highly of the creches under its\r\n\r\nmanagement.  However,  I  was rather  disappointed  to\r\n\r\nlearn  that the Ministry has lost interest in  running\r\n\r\nits creches, so much so that all its creches will soon\r\n\r\nbe  handed  to the NTUC and its affiliates.  With  due\r\n\r\nrespect  to the NTUC, Sir, I have not the least  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  be able to run these creches  just  as\r\n\r\nwell. All I want to say is that if the running of  the\r\n\r\ncreches  is  regarded  as part of its  responsibility,\r\n\r\nthen the Ministry should keep its own creches and look\r\n\r\nafter  them. I have no objection to the NTUC or  other\r\n\r\ninterested private parties being encouraged to set  up\r\n\r\ncreches  of  their own to augment social  services  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature. But I am sure that as more married women\r\n\r\nare encouraged to join the labour force, more and more\r\n\r\ncreches will be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point in my mind is that if eventually all\r\n\r\nthe  creches are handed over to the NTUC,  despite  my\r\n\r\nappeal made here, what will happen to the staff? There\r\n\r\nis a total staff of 96 in FY 77 employed to look after\r\n\r\nthe  creches. Will they all be retrenched? I  am  sure\r\n\r\nsome  of  the members of the staff must have undergone\r\n\r\nprofessional  training. Under such circumstances,  how\r\n\r\nwould their expertise be put to optimum use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang has asked whether a creche could be built in\r\n\r\nMarsiling area, in Sembawang constituency. The  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department fully agrees with the Member  that\r\n\r\nthere must be adequate creche facilities to look after\r\n\r\nthe  children  of  working mothers. Since  the  creche\r\n\r\nservices are very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhighly  subsidised, the Department  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nconvinced that there is a demand for such services  in\r\n\r\na  particular  area  before a  creche  is  built.  The\r\n\r\nbuilding of a creche can be considered if the need for\r\n\r\ncreche  facilities is established. Although there  are\r\n\r\nplans to establish more creches, the present policy is\r\n\r\nto  encourage and help the private sector  to  set  up\r\n\r\ntheir  own creche in or near their premises to  assist\r\n\r\nmarried  female workers who have young  children.  The\r\n\r\naim  is  to  encourage more married women to  take  up\r\n\r\nemployment in Singapore. The Social Welfare Department\r\n\r\nwill advise and assist any private or non-Governmental\r\n\r\norganisation  that wishes to start a  creche  for  its\r\n\r\nfemale  workers. It will also ensure that such creches\r\n\r\nare properly run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has said that the staff for\r\n\r\nthe creches of the Social Welfare Department have been\r\n\r\ndrastically  reduced. The reduction of  staff  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  creches  in  1976  was  the  result  of   the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  a  new  staffing  norm  which  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance and the Ministry of Social Affairs\r\n\r\nagreed   on  to  reduce  the  high  cost  of   running\r\n\r\nGovernment creches. Except for the few larger creches,\r\n\r\nthe majority of the other creches are not affected. In\r\n\r\nfact,  two  creches, such as Lee Kuo Chuan Creche  and\r\n\r\nthe  Tanjong Pagar Creche, have increased their  staff\r\n\r\nunder the new staffing norm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong's  query, let me correct the  picture  on  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of creches to-date. Only the Kallang  Creche\r\n\r\nhas  been transferred to SILO to run. In the  case  of\r\n\r\nthe  staff  in the Kallang Creche, they were  absorbed\r\n\r\ninto  the other 10 creches to fill vacancies.  As  for\r\n\r\nthe transfer of the other creches to the NTUC, this is\r\n\r\nstill under consideration and has not been implemented\r\n\r\nyet.  Should the creches be transferred to  the  NTUC,\r\n\r\nthey will have their own trained staff to operate  the\r\n\r\ncreches.  The  staff of the existing creches  will  be\r\n\r\nredeployed.  The  creches and the  equipment  will  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the NTUC on take-over.  However,  rent\r\n\r\nand  other  charges  will be met by  the  organisation\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary  has said just now that his Department  will\r\n\r\nencourage   more  private  commercial  and  industrial\r\n\r\norganisations to set up creches.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong\r\n\r\nLeong Boon).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this allocation is for the\r\n\r\nSingapore Sports Council. Last year the grant  was  $2\r\n\r\nmillion. For this financial year the allocation is  $1\r\n\r\nmillion.  There is a decrease of 50%, i.e. $1 million.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to know the reason. With such a  meagre\r\n\r\nsum  of  $1  million it is not sufficient  to  promote\r\n\r\nsports  on  a  national scale. If we want  to  promote\r\n\r\nsports island-wide so as to build a rugged nation,  we\r\n\r\nshould have adequate funds to achieve this objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council has, in the past few\r\n\r\nyears,  made certain achievements in the promotion  of\r\n\r\nsports  activities, particularly in  ball  games.  The\r\n\r\nstandards  of the various sports and games  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen raised. For instance, in the recent pre-World Cup\r\n\r\nFootball  Tournament, Asian Zone, held  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  placed second.  This  is  quite  good,\r\n\r\nthough  we  could not get first place.  That  is  some\r\n\r\nconsolation to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to answer two questions.\r\n\r\nThe first question is whether he would consider giving\r\n\r\nsome transport allowance to Sports liaison officers of\r\n\r\nthe various districts. They have all along contributed\r\n\r\nmuch  to  sports and games on a voluntary basis.  They\r\n\r\nhave  used  much  of their own time to attend  various\r\n\r\nmeetings  and  to  go out to help promote  sports  and\r\n\r\ngames.  Therefore,  we  should think  about  them  and\r\n\r\nprovide   them  with  some  transport  allowances   to\r\n\r\nencourage them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  make  some comments on the Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil.  I  would like to re-emphasise the  objective\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  always declared  that  in  our  sports\r\n\r\npromotion,  the intention is really to promote  sports\r\n\r\nparticipation  at mass level and that  we  should  not\r\n\r\nunduly  over-emphasise, over-stress and over-exert  to\r\n\r\nproduce  world beaters. I must however, Sir, add  that\r\n\r\nit  is  to  an  extent  a  necessity  for  our  sports\r\n\r\npromoters  to try to achieve some reasonable  standard\r\n\r\nfor our top sportsmen, at least at regional level. One\r\n\r\nof  these  side  effects  would  be  in  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest, not least politically but certainly, and the\r\n\r\nmore  important  level,  it  further  stimulates   and\r\n\r\nencourages mass interest and mass participation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore note with interest in the Main and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates that the  contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nSports  Council  remains at $4 million  which  is  not\r\n\r\ndifferent from that for the previous year. It is in  a\r\n\r\nsense  a  static contribution. However,  Sir,  looking\r\n\r\nunder  the  Development Estimates, I notice  that  the\r\n\r\ngrant to the Singapore Sports Council has dropped from\r\n\r\n$2  million for FY 76 to $1 million for FY 77  with  a\r\n\r\nprovision  for  revote.  I  would  like  to  seek  the\r\n\r\nMinister's clarification as to whether this drop  from\r\n\r\n$2  million  to  $1  million indicates  any  declining\r\n\r\ninterest, if at all, in sports promotion and, if  not,\r\n\r\nwhy this lesser figure. Sir, more importantly, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  seek  the Minister's views on the  following\r\n\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is in regard to the centralisation of all\r\n\r\nnational  sports associations under  one  roof.  I  am\r\n\r\naware  that in the past, Sports House at Rutland  Road\r\n\r\nwas  offered  to  all national sports associations  to\r\n\r\nhave  their  headquarters, but due  to  a  variety  of\r\n\r\nreasons  many  national sports associations  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able to maintain an office there. Sir,  I  found\r\n\r\nthis  most regrettable because this has created a  lot\r\n\r\nof   administrative  problems  in  liaison   and   co-ordination   work.   In  fact,   today   most   sports\r\n\r\nassociations   have  correspondence  addresses   which\r\n\r\nchange from year to year and sometimes from season  to\r\n\r\nseason. I notice that some national associations have,\r\n\r\nas a correspondence address, the home or the office of\r\n\r\ntheir  office bearers. As a result of this, Sir,  very\r\n\r\noften  correspondence is lost and letters do not reach\r\n\r\nthe  office-bearers in time. And by the time a  letter\r\n\r\nreaches   the  office-bearer,  it  may  take   months,\r\n\r\nsometimes  three to six months, by which  time  it  is\r\n\r\nalready a fait accompli. I am suggesting therefore that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Sports Council should  look  into  the\r\n\r\npossibility    of   getting   all   national    sports\r\n\r\nassociations  housed under one roof and preferably  at\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Sports Council.  This  will  certainly\r\n\r\nenhance  the  Sports Council as a  central  point  for\r\n\r\nsports   promotion   in  Singapore.   It   will   help\r\n\r\npromotional work for the various associations. I  know\r\n\r\nthat  there  are problems of finance. But  since  this\r\n\r\ncountry is encouraging sports participation on a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  scale, I think the least the Government can  do\r\n\r\nis to provide quarters at the Sports Council office at\r\n\r\nvery reasonable rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point relates to the Master Plan for\r\n\r\nSports  for  the next five years. I notice that  there\r\n\r\nhave  been  some  announcements regarding  the  Sports\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan. I feel that before the plan is drawn  up\r\n\r\nor  made  public, the Singapore Sports Council  should\r\n\r\nconsult  or  liaise with the various  national  sports\r\n\r\nassociations  regarding the promotion  of  sports  for\r\n\r\nSingapore for the next five years. I think the various\r\n\r\nsports  associations in many ways have the  expertise,\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge,  the interest of sports  promotion  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and I suggest therefore that they should be\r\n\r\nconsulted where the Master Plan is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerned. Certainly, when it comes to the question of\r\n\r\nprovision of sports facilities, they might be able  to\r\n\r\noffer some useful suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have really been asked to raise the next\r\n\r\npoint by some Members who are interested in jogging. I\r\n\r\nwas  told  that  MacRitchie Reservoir is  a  favourite\r\n\r\njogging  site,  perhaps for reasons of convenience  or\r\n\r\nfor other particular reasons. Nevertheless, MacRitchie\r\n\r\nReservoir  is a good site. It has changing  facilities\r\n\r\nbut there have been requests for locker facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point which I would like to raise under\r\n\r\nthis  subhead  is  the hope that the Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil may take it up. It is that up to today as  far\r\n\r\nas  I  know there is no institutionalised form of  co-ordination between the Sports Council and, of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  national sports associations on the one hand  and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Defence\r\n\r\non the other. As we know, trying to promote sports and\r\n\r\nalso  trying  to build a creditable team of  sportsmen\r\n\r\nrequires training in the schools, national service and\r\n\r\nafter. As such, because of this lack of co-ordination,\r\n\r\nseveral sports associations have found it difficult to\r\n\r\ntry   to  get  together  sportsmen  from  the  various\r\n\r\nquarters  for  training. The  sportsmen  might  be  at\r\n\r\nschool or in national service or out working. Hence, I\r\n\r\nthink  there is a place for some form of co-ordination\r\n\r\nto  be  established  between the Sports  Council,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education and the Ministry of Defence.  I\r\n\r\nam  suggesting  this. Sir, really in the  interest  of\r\n\r\nsports  promotion, and I would like the Hon.  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Social Affairs to give us his comments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, may I firstly\r\n\r\ncorrect both the Members for Sembawang and Kim Seng on\r\n\r\nthis   grant  of  $2  million?  This  grant  was   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects of sports facilities and not  for\r\n\r\nsports  promotion. It has not been reduced but the  $1\r\n\r\nmillion is carried over from FY 76 to FY 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports promotion is tempered with prudence and\r\n\r\ncontrol in spending\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommensurate with our policy, and I have stressed this\r\n\r\nmany times here, Sir, that nothing is for free. People\r\n\r\npay   only  a  nominal  sum  for  the  use  of  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities provided at a highly subsidised cost. ,This\r\n\r\nis  to ensure that recreational sports can come within\r\n\r\nthe reach of everybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion of the Member for Sembawang for\r\n\r\ntransport  allowances for sports liaison  officers,  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him that the SLOs are volunteers.  If  we\r\n\r\ngive  them rewards for their services, then as I  said\r\n\r\njust  now,  Sir,  the spirit of voluntarism  is  gone.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  appreciation  of  their  services,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports  Council has already  provided  them\r\n\r\nwith these privileges:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) free passes to witness football matches at the\r\n\r\nNational Stadium, including Malaysia Cup matches;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) concession rates for the use of all SSC swimming\r\n\r\npools;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) concession rates at SSC instructional lessons,\r\n\r\neither in swimming, tennis, squash;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) special rates for all seminars and courses\r\n\r\norganised by the SSC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now answer the points raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kim Seng. On the question of centralising\r\n\r\nall  national sports headquarters under one roof,  the\r\n\r\noriginal intention of the Sports House at Farrer  Park\r\n\r\nwas  to provide rooms for sports organisations.  There\r\n\r\nwere and still are some organisations which have rooms\r\n\r\nin  Sports  House. However, from our  experience,  the\r\n\r\nofficials  and  sportsmen  of  each  respective  sport\r\n\r\nhardly  need to communicate with those of other sports\r\n\r\nexcept at the annual general meetings of the Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Olympic  Council. Meetings  of  such  sports\r\n\r\norganisations  are held on voluntary arrangements  and\r\n\r\nare   restricted  to  the  officials  of  that  sport.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  think  there are no obvious  advantages\r\n\r\nalthough  the  opportunities  are  there  for   sports\r\n\r\norganisations to get under one roof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the Master Plan on sports\r\n\r\nfacilities for the period 1976 to 1981,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  was  presented to the Ministry  of  Finance  and\r\n\r\napproval was given to implement certain parts  of  the\r\n\r\nplan. The Plan was conceived in 1974 and completed  in\r\n\r\n1975.  Sports  organisations were  consulted  and  the\r\n\r\ntarget of the Master Plan was to arrive at sufficiency\r\n\r\nin  sports  facilities  for the more  popular  sports.\r\n\r\nSince,  in  principle, approval from the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  has  been  received, the Sports  Council  has\r\n\r\nbegun to implement the Master Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of co-ordination between the various\r\n\r\nbodies  involving the training of sportsmen,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe Member has made a good suggestion and we will look\r\n\r\ninto  this  to find ways and means to co-ordinate  the\r\n\r\nvarious organisations or bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding changing room facilities and lockers for\r\n\r\njoggers  at  MacRitchie Reservoir,  it  is  true  that\r\n\r\nchanging  facilities are there but no locker  service.\r\n\r\nThe  Jogging Association, I understand, has  indicated\r\n\r\nthis  to the Singapore Sports Council, and the  matter\r\n\r\nis being looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have provided changing facilities in many of\r\n\r\nour  sports  complexes and swimming  pools  at  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark,  Queenstown, Toa Payoh Athletic Centre  and  the\r\n\r\nNational  Stadium.

But  at\r\n\r\nthat  time  the  Social Welfare Department  was  still\r\n\r\nscouting  for  a suitable piece of land. Subsequently,\r\n\r\nthe Master Plan Committee allocated the former British\r\n\r\nAir Ministry and Wireless Station at Chia Keng I as  a\r\n\r\nsite  for the Home.

In view of the high costs and the relatively\r\n\r\nshort  tenure for the site, the Ministry had no choice\r\n\r\nbut  to reconsider the project, it was finally decided\r\n\r\nto proceed with it by scaling down the requirements to\r\n\r\nthe  bare  essentials.

To quote  an\r\n\r\nexample,  a  few  years ago I spoke about  the  vacant\r\n\r\nground  of  the old Raffles Institution. The  Minister\r\n\r\nhad  then  replied that a 70-storey building would  be\r\n\r\nconstructed  at  this place. Some years  have  already\r\n\r\npassed  and  we  are still waiting for  action  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken. Why is there such a delay? Could not this  land\r\n\r\nbe  used  more  productively in some  other  way?  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of my bringing up this issue is because  many\r\n\r\npeople have been grumbling when their land is acquired\r\n\r\nby  the  Government. In most cases they have to accept\r\n\r\nwhatever  compensation is given. But  after  that,  we\r\n\r\nfind the land seems to be left vacant. Why bother  the\r\n\r\npeople if the land is going to be left vacant? We must\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that  whatever land is  acquired  is  used\r\n\r\nproductively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Barker):</b> Sir, the Member for Anson is playing the same\r\n\r\ntune  on  his organ grinder in this House for  several\r\n\r\nyears.  But then the Prime Minister has got plenty  of\r\n\r\ntime for him. So have you, Mr Speaker, and so have I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refers to land being acquired and then left\r\n\r\nunused,   and  he  cites  just  one  example  -Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution.  May  I  point out  to  this  House  that\r\n\r\nRaffles Institution was not acquired by Government. It\r\n\r\nhas  always  belonged to us. It is only  that  Raffles\r\n\r\nInstitution  went to a new site. To put  it  straight.\r\n\r\nthe   site  itself  was  sold  by  Government  to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank of Singapore. It is the  Development\r\n\r\nBank of Singapore that is taking a long time to build.\r\n\r\nIn  the meanwhile, of course, we have not just left it\r\n\r\nas  useless  land.  We replanted  the  grass  and  our\r\n\r\nyounger citizens are having a good time playing soccer\r\n\r\nthere. The land is being made use of by many schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other sites, when a site is encumbered, it\r\n\r\ntakes  a  long  time to clear the land, especially  if\r\n\r\nthere are squatters. In order to move people, you have\r\n\r\nto find them homes. Having found them homes, there may\r\n\r\nbe  other encumbrances. As far as is possible, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  leave vacant land alone because it takes time  to\r\n\r\nbuild. We have to get planning approval and we have to\r\n\r\nget the finance in some cases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me assure the Member that the Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not acquire land unless it is required for  some\r\n\r\npublic  purpose. If any piece of land has been cleared\r\n\r\nand  is  vacant, just like Raffles Institution,  which\r\n\r\nincidentally  again was not acquired, there  are  good\r\n\r\nreasons for the delay. If the Member is interested  in\r\n\r\nfurther details about the Raffles Institution site,  I\r\n\r\nam  prepared  to  give it to him. I am just  wondering\r\n\r\nwhether he is an old boy of Raffles.

The designs have been\r\n\r\nsubstantially completed. In fact, they were  completed\r\n\r\nin  the  middle  of  last year  and  plans  have  been\r\n\r\nofficially  submitted to the competent  authority  for\r\n\r\napproval.

I remember that this Division  was  set  up\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the British withdrawal of  its  bases  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is already some eight to nine years now,\r\n\r\nand I wish to seek enlightenment from the Minister for\r\n\r\nLaw  and  the Environment as to the scope and function\r\n\r\nof this Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the short answer to the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol  is that the British left so much land  behind\r\n\r\nthat  the Bases Economic Conversion Division is  still\r\n\r\noperating.  The British ruled us for over  150  years.\r\n\r\nThey occupied the best parts of Singapore. I remember,\r\n\r\nas  a  little  boy living in Yio Chu Kang  Road,  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  Serangoon Gardens  and  no  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament  for Serangoon Gardens. I used to  walk  to\r\n\r\nSeletar  in the 1920s to watch the flying boats  land.\r\n\r\nThat was when they built Seletar Air Base. Just before\r\n\r\nthe  war, they  built  Tengah Air  Base.  During  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Occupation, the Japanese  built  Changi  Air\r\n\r\nBase.  Anyone  present  here  who  lived  during   the\r\n\r\nOccupation would know that there were so many  British\r\n\r\nregiments here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the Manchester Regiment, the Argyles and the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Gordon  Highlanders.  They  were  all  here,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Indian Regiments such as the  Hyderabad\r\n\r\nRegiment,  the  Punjab  Regiment  and  the  well-known\r\n\r\nGurkhas. They were all here living in barracks. So  in\r\n\r\n1968  when  the British announced their  intention  to\r\n\r\npull out, we had to form the Bases Economic Conversion\r\n\r\nDepartment,  with  two main functions:  to  take  over\r\n\r\nreverted properties and to retrain the workers.  Quite\r\n\r\na few of our people were employed either by the Royal\r\n\r\nAir  Force, the British Navy, or the British Army, and\r\n\r\ntheir  services  became  redundant  when  the  British\r\n\r\npulled  out.  It  meant retraining.  Hence  the  Bases\r\n\r\nEconomic Conversion Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the completion of its major functions\r\n\r\nthere  are  still  residual  functions.  In  1973  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  was  absorbed as a Division  in  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice.  The Division is now primarily concerned  with\r\n\r\nadministration of reverted properties, including Asian\r\n\r\nquarters. If the Member is interested further, out  of\r\n\r\nthe  original staff of 56 there only remains a nucleus\r\n\r\nof  19  officers working under the direction of senior\r\n\r\nstaff of the Land\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice.  The  Division  is also still  concerned  with\r\n\r\nDefence  properties which have been made available  to\r\n\r\nthe  New  Zealand forces under the five-power  defence\r\n\r\nagreement   and   is,   in  fact,   the   channel   of\r\n\r\ncommunication  between  the  ANZAC  Forces   and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government in respect of such properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might mention that as soon as the property came to\r\n\r\nus   there  was  a  big  scramble  among  the  various\r\n\r\ndepartments. The Ministry of Defence, of  course,  got\r\n\r\nmost  of the land. The University of Singapore now  is\r\n\r\nin   Kent   Ridge  which  formerly  was  a  site   for\r\n\r\nresidential  quarters of army officers, and  the  NTUC\r\n\r\ngot  the Changi Beach Hotel which apparently was  used\r\n\r\nas a holiday resort and which they have moved out now.\r\n\r\nTo  mention one fact, the Naval Dockyard at  Sembawang\r\n\r\nhad  to be converted into a civilian dockyard. Instead\r\n\r\nof  attending to battleships and cruisers, it  has  to\r\n\r\nserve  merchant  ships. It is not easy  to  convert  a\r\n\r\nnaval  dockyard  into a civilian  one,  and  for  that\r\n\r\nreason we had to employ the firm of Swan & Hunter  who\r\n\r\ndid  the  same job in Malta, and they did a  good  job\r\n\r\nhere.  Apparently, workers in naval ships  do  not  do\r\n\r\nexactly the same job as on merchant ships. I need  not\r\n\r\ngo into further details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, if I heard it right, the Hon\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned just now the word \"retraining\".

A crash training programme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsisting of courses of three months duration each at\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Vocational Institute and  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board's workshop at River Valley Road  and\r\n\r\nfive  other  technical schools was  started  in  April\r\n\r\n1968.  A  total of about 1,700 Base workers  underwent\r\n\r\nthe  training  courses  in  turning  and  fitting,  in\r\n\r\nelectrical  fitting  and installation,  motor  vehicle\r\n\r\nmechanics,  sheet  metal  works,  welding,   plumbing,\r\n\r\nrefrigeration   and   air-conditioning,    woodworking\r\n\r\nmachine  operations,  woodwork  furniture  production,\r\n\r\nengineering drawing, electroplating and basic  plastic\r\n\r\ntechnology.

The methodology was to start  off\r\n\r\ncleaning the main streets and the thoroughfares  which\r\n\r\nalmost  everyone  use, through exhortation,  campaigns\r\n\r\nand then legislation to punish the recalcitrants. Then\r\n\r\nefforts  were  shifted to the side-streets  with  much\r\n\r\nsuccess.   So  today  we  see  the  clean  and   green\r\n\r\nenvironment whenever we drive or bus down main streets\r\n\r\nor into side-streets. Then, of course, tragedy struck.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of the Environment was formed. There was\r\n\r\na  standstill. Yes, the main streets and  side-streets\r\n\r\nwere kept spick and span but nothing beyond that;  for\r\n\r\na   few  people  -  except  residents  and  occasional\r\n\r\nvisitors  and, of course, frequent visits to the  area\r\n\r\nby  MPs, never VIPs - travel beyond these streets into\r\n\r\nthe  kampongs and squatter areas. Members of the House\r\n\r\nwho  are unfortunate enough to suffer the same fate  - my constituents and I suffer - due to lack of interest\r\n\r\nshown  by  the Ministry of the Environment on squatter\r\n\r\nareas and kampongs will most certainly need no further\r\n\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new-tangled machinery imported by the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  cater to the cleaning of only main streets further\r\n\r\nillustrates  lack of interest to try to  beautify  our\r\n\r\nkampongs and squatter areas. No modifications of these\r\n\r\nmachines  have  been  considered  to  enable  them  to\r\n\r\nservice  the  more squalid areas. Greater efforts  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  to ensure that these congested  areas  that\r\n\r\nface  greater  health and fire risks are  kept  clean.\r\n\r\nThis will, of course, necessitate greater vigilance by\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry.  I  am  not  suggesting  a  \"Keep  the\r\n\r\nSingapore kampongs and squatter areas clean\" campaign.\r\n\r\nPerish the thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Sir, the \"Keep Singapore Clean\"\r\n\r\ncampaign  sufficed.

Recently,  in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency many farmers have received notices to the\r\n\r\neffect  that the Ministry of the Environment is asking\r\n\r\nthem  to  install  sanitary system.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nfarmers  in  the  water catchment  areas,  of  course.\r\n\r\nnobody  would object to this request. But the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  the  Environment stipulates that the  farmers  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  install within two months  the  sanitary\r\n\r\nsystem by contractors to be named by the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made enquiries. According to the farmers.\r\n\r\nthey  will  have to pay about $2,000 for one  sanitary\r\n\r\nsystem and it would take some two weeks to build  one.\r\n\r\nSo  many  of  them  have to install modern  sanitation\r\n\r\nwithin so short a time of two months, and it is to  be\r\n\r\ndone  by  the contractors named by the Ministry.  This\r\n\r\ngives  rise  to some problems. First the time  is  too\r\n\r\nshort,  and because they have to do it so quickly  the\r\n\r\ncost  will go up too. I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether it would be possible to give them some kind of\r\n\r\na  concession  by way of financial aid or  some  other\r\n\r\nassistance.  I would like to ask the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  whether they can give them 50%  grant  or\r\n\r\none-third of the financial cost involved. If  this  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible,  then  will  it  be  possible  for  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank of Singapore, by special arrangement.\r\n\r\nto  give them some kind of interest-free loan  or,  if\r\n\r\nthat  is  not possible, a low-interest loan,  so  that\r\n\r\nthese  farmers  will be able to build  their  sanitary\r\n\r\nsystem according to the requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is whether it will be possible for\r\n\r\nthe farmers to get their own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontractors  to  do the job. Some of the  farmers  are\r\n\r\nmasons, and they can therefore do the work themselves.\r\n\r\nThe  third  point  is whether the time  limit  can  be\r\n\r\nextended. Instead of two months, can it be extended to\r\n\r\nthree or six months? This is to give them enough time.\r\n\r\nThe   farmers  are  prepared  to  cooperate  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  but  they should not be forced  to  do  it\r\n\r\nquickly and at such a high cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is in relation to the medical\r\n\r\nexamination  of  hawkers in the food  centres.  In  my\r\n\r\nconstituency  many hawkers have been repeatedly  asked\r\n\r\nto  go for medical examination by the Ministry of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.  Of  course, basically there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nwrong  with this as it will ensure that food  handlers\r\n\r\nare  in good health and free from infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nBut in terms of procedure, I think some improvement is\r\n\r\npossible.  According to the present practice,  hawkers\r\n\r\nnotified for medical examination are required to go en\r\n\r\nbloc to the hospital before 8.00 a.m. for their medical\r\n\r\nexamination. This medical examination will  take  more\r\n\r\nthan  one morning. Some will have to go for three days\r\n\r\nor even one whole week. Now if we want all the hawkers\r\n\r\nto  go together, they have to wait until 10, 11 or  12\r\n\r\no'clock. I ask whether it is possible to simplify  the\r\n\r\nprocedure so as not to give them so much trouble. Just\r\n\r\nimagine requiring them to go for so many days  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning  when morning is their peak hour. They  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  made to incur losses as a result  of  medical\r\n\r\nexamination.  Then, of course, in terms of  timing,  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  that they can be asked to  appear  for\r\n\r\nmedical  examination  in batches at  staggered  times,\r\n\r\ninstead of all at the same time before 8.00 a.m. I hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister will give me a favourable reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, without wanting\r\n\r\nto  knock  heads together, as one MP saying  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the Environment has gone to  sleep  ever\r\n\r\nsince  it  was first started under my predecessor,  Mr\r\n\r\nLim Kim San, and the Member for Jurong grumbling about\r\n\r\nthe  measures we take to install modern sanitation  or\r\n\r\nwhen we give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njabs   to   hawkers,   perhaps  they   should   change\r\n\r\nconstituencies. But since the Member for Jurong  spoke\r\n\r\nin  a more modest pleading tone, I think I should deal\r\n\r\nwith him first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is well aware that the development of the\r\n\r\nPUB  western  catchment reservoir scheme has  made  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  farmers to install a  simple  sanitary\r\n\r\nsystem.  But I agree with the Member that two  months'\r\n\r\nnotice  is too short and the Sewerage Department  will\r\n\r\nextend  this period to six months or even more if  the\r\n\r\nMember  pleads again. Whilst the Ministry is  prepared\r\n\r\nto  offer advice to the farmers on the construction of\r\n\r\nthe  sanitary  system,  it is regretted  that  we  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  give  any subsidy. We have made  inquiries\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Development Bank of  Singapore,  but  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  that they are governed by their lending terms.\r\n\r\nThey  are  governed  by  normal banking  practice  and\r\n\r\nprinciples  and  they  will  not  be  able   to   give\r\n\r\nsubsidised loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for mass inoculation, there was an exercise for\r\n\r\nhawkers as a prevention against typhoid fever from 1st\r\n\r\nSeptember.  1975  to  27th April,  1  976  at  various\r\n\r\nmarkets  and food centres. This was done promptly  and\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers  were  not  required  to  wait  for  long\r\n\r\nperiods.  But I think the hon. Member is referring  to\r\n\r\nthe screening of hawkers at the Middleton Hospital for\r\n\r\ntyphoid and other gastrointestinal diseases. For  such\r\n\r\ncases  more time is required for the necessary medical\r\n\r\nexaminations  which include the taking of  stools  and\r\n\r\nblood  samples. But if the Member is complaining about\r\n\r\ndelays  outside  the hospital, I will  certainly  look\r\n\r\ninto his request if he gives me more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal with the Member for Potong Pasir. The\r\n\r\nway he opened up, I thought the whole of Singapore  is\r\n\r\ndirty.  But  at least the Member admitted that  though\r\n\r\nnothing much has been done, our main streets and side-streets  are still clean. It is not only for tourists.\r\n\r\nIt is for us. We have mechanical sweepers. We imported\r\n\r\nthem  at  considerable  costs. It  makes  sweeping  of\r\n\r\nroads,  which are tarmac or concrete, easy.  It  saves\r\n\r\nlabour.  But  unfortunately these mechanical  sweepers\r\n\r\ncannot go into all kampongs, nor will they do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  good  if  they sweep sandy roads.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\neven some of our lorries which carry rubbish cannot go\r\n\r\ninto  every  kampong, and it is for that  reason  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  kampongs  are  dirtier  than  the   main\r\n\r\nstreets.  But perhaps the Member for Potong  Pasir  is\r\n\r\nonly  talking  about  Potong Pasir  kampong.  Come  to\r\n\r\nTanglin.  We  have kampongs from the  Botanic  Gardens\r\n\r\nright down to Race Course Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> That is because the Minister for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment is in that constituency\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is what somebody else has said. But\r\n\r\nour  kampongs are relatively clean. It really  depends\r\n\r\non  the  people living in the kampongs. You can  sweep\r\n\r\nyour  rubbish and burn it if you like, if our  lorries\r\n\r\ndo   not  come.  But  the  fact  is  that  our  refuse\r\n\r\ncollection   vehicles  collect  rubbish   every   day,\r\n\r\nincluding  Sundays. Without a daily refuse  collection\r\n\r\nservice,  I  think our roads would be  dirtier.  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid  we cannot deploy more workmen to remove refuse\r\n\r\nin  kampongs.  But  every effort is  being  made  with\r\n\r\napproaches  to the Ministry of Finance to employ  more\r\n\r\nlabour. But should there be heaps of rubbish in any of\r\n\r\nthe  constituencies,  all  they  have  to  do  is   to\r\n\r\ntelephone the Ministry of the Environment and we  will\r\n\r\nsend  one  lorry, and if that is not enough, we  will\r\n\r\nsend more. That is an assurance I give the Member.  If\r\n\r\nhe cannot get me, get my Parliamentary Secretary or my\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for campaigns, I think too many Campaigns\r\n\r\nsometimes  lose their own force. We have had  so  many\r\n\r\ncampaigns  that  I think, sometimes the  public  is  a\r\n\r\nlittle  tired of campaigns. I have had a  few  myself.\r\n\r\nfor instance. \"Keep the city green\". We had a campaign\r\n\r\nto  clean up the schools in which I, as the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin,  visited  many schools and all  the  children\r\n\r\nwere  working there. But what happened. At the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  day  it was the Ministry of the Environment  that\r\n\r\nhad to spend the next week collecting the rubbish from\r\n\r\nall  the  schools.  So if he has got  rubbish  in  his\r\n\r\nkampongs or his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituency all he has to do is to give us a ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, with that assurance I have Hobson's\r\n\r\nchoice but to beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead BAA 1101* (*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lee\r\n\r\nYiok Seng)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in moving this amendment I\r\n\r\ndo  not intend to belittle the efforts of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  the  Environment;  on  the  contrary,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Hon. Minister for looking  after  the\r\n\r\nenvironment of Singapore so wonderfully well.  He  has\r\n\r\nset  a very high standard of environmental health  and\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry  has measured up to it remarkably  well.\r\n\r\nHence, a clean and green Singapore, among the best  in\r\n\r\npublic health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still areas for improvement. Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the  Addendum  to  the Presidential  Address,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for the Environment said that air  pollution\r\n\r\nwas  on  the increase and that anti-pollution measures\r\n\r\nwould  have to be enforced more stringently. I  cannot\r\n\r\nagree   with  him  more  in  this  respect.  I  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  like  to draw his attention  to  the  poor\r\n\r\nventilation  of  the car parks inside  some  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings.  The  question I  would  like  to  pose  is\r\n\r\nwhether  the Hon. Minister is aware of this fact, and\r\n\r\nwhether  any  measure has been taken  to  rectify  the\r\n\r\nsituation and also to ascertain the health hazards  to\r\n\r\npersonnel  working for long periods of  time  in  such\r\n\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter I would like to raise is that on\r\n\r\nthe  use of ultra-violet light for decorative purposes\r\n\r\nand for producing certain stage effects, especially in\r\n\r\nplaces of entertainment. As the Minister is aware that\r\n\r\nultra-violet light is harmful to human eyes and  skin,\r\n\r\nwould   he   therefore  consider  taking   appropriate\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  dissuade the public  from  using  ultra-violet light for such purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, my colleague has told us just now\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of the Environment has done very\r\n\r\nwell in looking after the environmental health of\r\n\r\nSingapore. I agree with him. But there are always two\r\n\r\nsides to a story. Although you may be successful in\r\n\r\none aspect some other matters are affected. The Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister in his efforts to enhance the environmental\r\n\r\nhealth has given rise to some other problems. I would\r\n\r\nlike to let him know of these problems. In the rural\r\n\r\nareas, for example, many families are engaged in the\r\n\r\npreparation and operation of a great variety of food.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the manufacture of food, they are also\r\n\r\nengaged in selling coffee, cooked food, cake making,\r\n\r\nbiscuits, bread, taohu, taokua bean curd, fish ball,\r\n\r\netc. This family business provides the supply of\r\n\r\ncooked food and other prepared food for neighbouring\r\n\r\nresidents in the rural areas and for the hawkers in\r\n\r\nthe vicinity. This kind of business is run on a family\r\n\r\nbasis, a small-time business. Everybody in the family\r\n\r\nworks hard and they depend on this small business for\r\n\r\ntheir livelihood. These people have been doing such\r\n\r\nbusiness for many, many years. Many of them have\r\n\r\ninherited their business from their ancestors for a\r\n\r\nfew decades. At least, some of them have five to six\r\n\r\nyears' history in doing this kind of business.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are running a small business, the whole\r\n\r\nfamily depends on this kind of business for their\r\n\r\nlivelihood and they are able to live quite happily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier in\r\n\r\nthis  House, the people in the rural areas are not  so\r\n\r\nwell  versed  in  Government  administration  and  the\r\n\r\norganisation  of  the  Government  departments.  These\r\n\r\npeople  only know how to make use of their own  effort\r\n\r\nand  labour to do a small business in their own  homes\r\n\r\nfor  a  living. They think there is nothing  wrong  in\r\n\r\ndoing  this kind of business. As far as they can  see,\r\n\r\nthis  is  not a crime. Neither do they know that  they\r\n\r\nhave  to apply to the Ministry of the Environment  for\r\n\r\nIicences to operate such business. In fact,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright  from the very beginning when they started  such\r\n\r\nbusiness,  no  Government officers had  ever  informed\r\n\r\nthem  of  the  requirement to apply for a  licence  to\r\n\r\noperate  such a business. So all along they have  been\r\n\r\ndependent   on  business  as  their  sole   means   of\r\n\r\nlivelihood.  Now  the  situation  is  different.  When\r\n\r\nofficers from the Environmental Health Section of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  come  to  notice  the  existence   of   this\r\n\r\nbusiness, they would send out letters asking  them  to\r\n\r\nstop  operations forthwith and also informing them  of\r\n\r\nthe  requirement to apply for licences,  however  long\r\n\r\nthey  might have been operating. These people are also\r\n\r\ntold  that  they have been doing illegal business  all\r\n\r\nthis   time   as   unauthorised   eating   houses   or\r\n\r\nunauthorised food manufacturers. The modus operandi of\r\n\r\nthis Department is this. First they start off politely\r\n\r\n-  give  you a letter or notice to stop your business,\r\n\r\nand  if  it  is not complied with, a summons  will  be\r\n\r\nissued. Then you know you will be fined or have to pay\r\n\r\na  composition in lieu of a fine. Then the money  paid\r\n\r\ncan  get  one out of trouble. After the payment  of  a\r\n\r\nfine  on  composition, if the order  is  not  complied\r\n\r\nwith,  then  the  premises  will  be  required  to  be\r\n\r\ndemolished. Otherwise official action will be taken to\r\n\r\ndemolish the premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is too strict an\r\n\r\nenforcement because the livelihood of these people  is\r\n\r\nthreatened.  How are they going to earn their  living?\r\n\r\nThis method of the ends justifying the means does  not\r\n\r\ncare  for  the  difficulty and  the  plight  of  these\r\n\r\npeople.  It  is too rigid and not humane.  This  would\r\n\r\ngive  rise  to  a lot of hardship to these  people.  I\r\n\r\nwould therefore plead for flexibility and leniency  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with such cases. I will therefore propose  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister concerned two alternative propositions to\r\n\r\nhelp them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to issue them with temporary licences\r\n\r\nfor  these  small business operations for a  few  more\r\n\r\nyears  to enable them to carry on their business while\r\n\r\nthey  try to change their method of earning a  living.\r\n\r\nThe  alternative  is  to give these  people  a  hawker\r\n\r\nlicence and allocate them a hawker stall so that  they\r\n\r\nhave  some other alternative means of livelihood. When\r\n\r\nI suggest the method of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissuing  hawker licences to these people, I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will inform the Hawkers' Department to  issue\r\n\r\nor  grant  licences directly to such people,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  not have to be confronted with  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nfrustrating  conditions to be imposed by the  Hawkers'\r\n\r\nDepartment  resulting  in  the  rejection   of   their\r\n\r\napplications.  This  is  my  hope  which  I  pray  the\r\n\r\nMinister will consider sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the Member for Buona Vista raised\r\n\r\ntwo  points - one on car parks and the other on ultra-violet  lighting in nightclubs. Some  of  the  Members\r\n\r\nhere had better watch it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for car parks, as a preventive measure, action is\r\n\r\nnow  being  taken. In fact, it should have been  taken\r\n\r\nlong ago at the planning stage by the Building Control\r\n\r\nDivision  to incorporate requirements for satisfactory\r\n\r\nventilation.  But my Ministry has been  aware  of  the\r\n\r\npoor ventilation of some car parks especially in high-rise  buildings.  The  Anti-Pollution  Unit  has  been\r\n\r\nconducting surveys on the level of carbon monoxide  in\r\n\r\na  number of car parks. Where the level was high,  the\r\n\r\nowners  of the car parks have been notified to improve\r\n\r\nthe  ventilation  and  they have  done  so.  The  Unit\r\n\r\nfurther  carries  out  surveys  at  these  car   parks\r\n\r\nregularly  to  see that the level of  carbon  monoxide\r\n\r\ndoes not rise too high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for nightclubs and ultra-violet lights, the\r\n\r\nflashing  lights are used in nightclubs for decorative\r\n\r\npurposes   and   for   producing  stage   effects   on\r\n\r\nentertainers  and  guests. But the  amount  of  ultra-violet  light produced by these lights is very  small.\r\n\r\nWe  can take comfort that its effective range is  less\r\n\r\nthan  two  feet.  Apart  from  the  effects  of  these\r\n\r\nflashing  lights on the eyes, it has no  real  harmful\r\n\r\nhealth  effects,  especially when one  is  exposed  to\r\n\r\nthese lights for a very short duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Bukit Panjang, in order to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the food intended for sale  is  fit  for\r\n\r\nhuman  consumption and is hygienically prepared, basic\r\n\r\nand essential health requirements have to be observed.\r\n\r\nHence these notices on the food manufacturers in Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang who have been unable to meet with these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequirements. It is not in the interest of the  public\r\n\r\nand,  in  fact, against our health laws to issue  such\r\n\r\noperators  with  a  licence.  I  am  against   issuing\r\n\r\ntemporary  licences.  Once  a  temporary  licence   is\r\n\r\nissued, it has a sense of permanency and when we  take\r\n\r\nit  away there is always trouble. It is better to give\r\n\r\nthem time even if they are unauthorised rather than to\r\n\r\ngive  some  authorisation by way of a piece  of  paper\r\n\r\ncalled  a  licence. It is better to give a  reasonable\r\n\r\ngrace  period to the food manufacturer to wind up  his\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My short answer to the Member in respect of his\r\n\r\nrequest  for  hawker licences to  be  issued  to  such\r\n\r\nmanufacturers and stalls to be provided, is \"No\".  But\r\n\r\nthey  have a chance if they qualify on the grounds  of\r\n\r\nhardship.  As  for hardship. I leave it for  a  while.\r\n\r\nMembers   have  plenty  of  time  to  argue  with   my\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary when he gets on  his  feet  to\r\n\r\ntell  what is the definition of \"hardship cases\".  But\r\n\r\nperhaps we should find a new category so that  we  can\r\n\r\naccommodate people or small food manufacturers of  the\r\n\r\ntype the Member for Bukit Panjang has spoken about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are always dangers and if I may just cite\r\n\r\none  case. We had typhoid fever spreading in a certain\r\n\r\nplace.  On  investigations,  we  found  that  all  the\r\n\r\npatients  had  eaten nasi lemak. I need not  translate\r\n\r\nthat  for you. It was prepared by just one person.  We\r\n\r\nwere  fast  enough  to stop it These  are  small  food\r\n\r\nmanufacturers.  They  prepared  the  nasi   lemak   or\r\n\r\nwhatever it is and they sell. In this particular case,\r\n\r\nwe were very lucky because we got to the source of the\r\n\r\ninfection. Hence we have got to be very careful. I  am\r\n\r\nnot  suggesting that people should not buy nasi lemak;\r\n\r\nthis  case  has been cleared up. But this is  just  an\r\n\r\nexample  to  show that we must always be conscious  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that food manufacturers can spread disease,\r\n\r\nand  if Members do not want to get typhoid, do not buy\r\n\r\nice  cream  from  unauthorised vendors  or  ice  water\r\n\r\nsellers. That is the major source of typhoid  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry. Most of the time when there is an outbreak of\r\n\r\ntyphoid,  it is traced to someone selling  either  ice\r\n\r\nwater or ice drinks or even in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nsome  cases ice cream.

Of course,  I\r\n\r\nrealise  that  there are other places of entertainment\r\n\r\nwhere  decorative lights are used whether  it  is  the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead BBA 1101.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the\r\n\r\nMinister to the refuse collection centre located  near\r\n\r\nresidences and markets. For most of the day, the place\r\n\r\nlooks all right and there is no smell coming from  it.\r\n\r\nBut  at  certain times of the day when the  refuse  is\r\n\r\nbeing collected by the trucks, the stench is most over-powering.  Could  the Environment Ministry  look  into\r\n\r\nthis  and perhaps use some odour-killing agent to  get\r\n\r\nrid of the smell as soon as possible after the rubbish\r\n\r\nhas been collected?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The hon.

On  the odour problem from rubbish chutes  and\r\n\r\nbin  centres, especially in housing estates,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  inform the Member that refuse is removed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board every day from  the\r\n\r\nchutes to the bin centres and from the bin centres  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  the  Environment  to  the  disposal\r\n\r\nground.  The refuse chutes and bin centres are  washed\r\n\r\ndaily.  What is it that he wants us to spread? Eau  de\r\n\r\ncologne?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be smell and nuisance if domestic refuse\r\n\r\nis  wet and decomposes rapidly in hot weather. Perhaps\r\n\r\nhouseholders  could help to improve the  situation  by\r\n\r\nputting wet and organic refuse in plastic bags  before\r\n\r\ndisposing them into the refuse chutes. Another measure\r\n\r\nbeing  undertaken by the Housing and Development Board\r\n\r\nis  the provision of roofs for bin centres to keep out\r\n\r\nthe  rain and the sun. This would help keep the refuse\r\n\r\ndry  and  reduce  the odour and the temperature  down.\r\n\r\nWithout  wanting  to pull the leg of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah, all I can say is that it is difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubbish smells and sometimes the smell is terrible.\r\n\r\nEven  when  the  Ministry of the  Environment's  lorry\r\n\r\npasses  you,  you  cannot get  away  from  the  smell,\r\n\r\nespecially  if  the  lorry is  leaking.  But  we  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  look into his request and see what  can  be\r\n\r\ndone  to minimise the odour that comes from these  bin\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, in view of the reply from the\r\n\r\nMinister, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This\r\n\r\nhas been thrashed out in the many discussions held  in\r\n\r\nthe  past by the various authorities concerned. In one\r\n\r\nof  the  discussions,  it was decided  that  the  last\r\n\r\ncremation  at 3 o'clock p.m. was to be extended  to  4\r\n\r\no'clock p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now we have a fresh problem in regard to\r\n\r\nthe  crematorium. It appears that at the Mount Vernon\r\n\r\nCrematorium  there is a very heavy  booking  for  the\r\n\r\ncremation  of  bodies by the various communities.  As\r\n\r\nsuch,  the time given by the staff of the crematorium\r\n\r\nto  an applicant for a cremation in most cases is not\r\n\r\nsuitable.  I  have received many complaints  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  because  alternative  arrangements  for  the\r\n\r\nfuneral have to be made. Sometimes they even have  to\r\n\r\npostpone for a day because of the non-availability of\r\n\r\nthe  crematorium According to Hindu  custom  you  can\r\n\r\nonly  keep  the  body for 24 hours.  Even  the  staff\r\n\r\nattached to the crematorium could not help the people\r\n\r\nin any way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem did not exist in the past. Why is the\r\n\r\npeople being inconvenienced now? Something should  be\r\n\r\ndone  immediately to rectify the situation.  Just  to\r\n\r\nquote  you  a case. A few weeks ago on a Sunday, the\r\n\r\nbreadwinner of a family passed away in the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital. His body could not be released till\r\n\r\nthe  following day because of a post-mortem.  On  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  Monday at 10 a.m. after the post-mortem,  a\r\n\r\nrelative and a friend collected the death certificate\r\n\r\nfrom the mortuary and rushed down to the Mount Vernon\r\n\r\nCrematorium  at 11 am, to make arrangements  for  the\r\n\r\nfuneral to take place in the afternoon. But to  their\r\n\r\ndisappointment, the person in charge told  them  that\r\n\r\nthe body could only be brought in at 1 p.m. and at no\r\n\r\nother time. These two persons could not decide on the\r\n\r\nsuggested  time,  because of the  very  short  notice\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they rushed back to town to consult  with\r\n\r\nthe eldest son of the deceased. Later, as time was so\r\n\r\nshort, the family of the deceased decided reluctantly\r\n\r\nto bury the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the relative who was making the arrangements had\r\n\r\nto rush back to Mount Vernon Crematorium to take back\r\n\r\nthe  death certificate and then back to the  mortuary\r\n\r\nto  get  it  altered for a burial. And  finally, the\r\n\r\ncasket  company  had to make the arrangements  for  a\r\n\r\nburial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later, there was another funeral. Here\r\n\r\nagain, the deceased passed away in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  General Hospital on a Friday and  a  post-mortem  had  to be carried out on the following  day,\r\n\r\nbecause  the family of the deceased were ignorant  of\r\n\r\nthe  post-mortem procedure whereby a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  would  be  required by  the  pathologist  and\r\n\r\ncoroner  to  identify the body. This dead person  was\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be  cremated  on  the  following   day,\r\n\r\nSaturday.  But  it  had  to be  postponed  to  Sunday\r\n\r\nbecause  of  heavy bookings at the crematorium.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhy  should so much problems be caused to people  who\r\n\r\nhave  to fight against time to make arrangements  for\r\n\r\nfunerals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is observed that only two gas chambers have been\r\n\r\nallocated  for  Hindu cremations. Furthermore, other\r\n\r\ncommunities  are also using the same place.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy the bookings are heavy. Something must be done to\r\n\r\nimprove  this situation. Previously there  were  nine\r\n\r\nchambers  for cremation but now there are  only  two.\r\n\r\nThese  two  are not only for the Hindus but  for  the\r\n\r\nother  races  as  well. How can they  be  sufficient?\r\n\r\nAccording to Hindu custom once you take the  body  to\r\n\r\nthe  crematorium you cannot bring it back to the home\r\n\r\nor  for  burial.  That is very important.  The  Hindu\r\n\r\nSabai  has  also  sent a letter to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs regarding this matter.  I  am  indeed\r\n\r\nrather surprised that an assurance was given sometime\r\n\r\nago  that the bodies could be brought in after 3 p.m.\r\n\r\nfor cremation and now there is so much problem caused\r\n\r\nto mourners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Minister to settle this problem\r\n\r\nonce  and for all. Otherwise, it is better to go back\r\n\r\nto the old system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister understands the Hindu\r\n\r\ntradition.  If  the  present  two  chambers  are  not\r\n\r\nsufficient  for cremation, then go back  to  the  old\r\n\r\nsystem where there were more places for cremation.  I\r\n\r\nhope   the  Minister  will  look  into  this   matter\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I say with respect to the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson that it would be a retrograde  step\r\n\r\nto   go  back  to  the  old  system.  The  number  of\r\n\r\ncremations in the Mount Vernon Crematorium  has  been\r\n\r\nabout  10 per day for the last six months. The  seven\r\n\r\ncremators are able to cope with 15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncremations per day. It is not our policy to go against\r\n\r\nany  custom  or rites, whether they be Hindu,  Muslim,\r\n\r\nChristian   or   others.   That   certainly   is   not\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy. When we first started  this  new\r\n\r\ncrematorium  the  Hindu Advisory  Board  made  certain\r\n\r\nrepresentations  and  we  listened  to  them.  We  had\r\n\r\nmeetings  with them, at which the Member was  present,\r\n\r\nand most of their recommendations were accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the time, previously it was 3.00 p.m. for the\r\n\r\nlast  cremation. Now it is being extended to 4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\nWe would like to extend it to 5.00 p.m. and have taken\r\n\r\nup  the  question of recruiting more  staff  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance. I hope we succeed. The choice  of\r\n\r\nthe  time for cremation is left to the family  of  the\r\n\r\ndeceased  but it is not easy to satisfy everybody.  If\r\n\r\nthe  cremator has been booked for the time chosen, the\r\n\r\napplicant is offered an alternative time for cremation\r\n\r\non the same day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first case mentioned by the Member, an\r\n\r\nalternative  time was offered but was not accepted  by\r\n\r\nthe  relatives.  Our  records show  that  bookings  on\r\n\r\nSaturdays  for the past two weeks had not  been  heavy\r\n\r\nand no relatives who applied for cremation were turned\r\n\r\naway  without  being offered an alternative  time  for\r\n\r\ncremation on the same day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member, of the seven\r\n\r\ncremators available, three have been modified to  suit\r\n\r\nHindu cremation. For an average of 20 Hindu cremations\r\n\r\nper  month,  the  facilities appear to  be  more  than\r\n\r\nadequate  to  meet the needs of the community.  Should\r\n\r\ncircumstances  show  that more cremators  are  needed,\r\n\r\nthese will be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

But since then we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  many troubles. Sometimes the crematorium is fully\r\n\r\nbooked and they have to keep the bodies either at home\r\n\r\nor  in  the  mortuary.  The  Hindu  people  have  been\r\n\r\npressing  the  Hindu Advisory Board  on  this  matter.\r\n\r\nToday I have mentioned about the Hindu Sabai sending a\r\n\r\nletter  to  the  Ministry of Social Affairs  regarding\r\n\r\nthis matter. The Hon. Minister will have to reconsider\r\n\r\nthis  matter. I think he understands the  position.  I\r\n\r\nbeg  the  Minister to do it for the general public.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will do it. Anyway, Sir, I beg leave\r\n\r\nto withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of subhead BGA 1101*. (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs\r\n\r\nP Govindaswamy, Ahmad Haleem, Lee Yiok Seng, Ng Kah Ting, Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin and Dr Ong Leong Boon.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Geylang Serai area will soon have a market. The\r\n\r\nconstruction of this market will be completed  shortly\r\n\r\nand  it is located at Haig Road. Since a market  is  a\r\n\r\nvital necessity for the everyday life of all strata of\r\n\r\nsociety,  it is therefore imperative that the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment organise the layout in a proper manner.  It\r\n\r\nis  possible that in this particular market there will\r\n\r\nbe  stalls selling fish, vegetables, meat, piece goods\r\n\r\nand  also food stalls. In other words, this will be  a\r\n\r\nmultipurpose market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only wish is that no friction and suspicion will\r\n\r\narise between Muslims and non-Muslims. Therefore,  may\r\n\r\nI  ask whether provision will be made to sell pork  in\r\n\r\nthis  market.  If  so,  I seek the  assurance  of  the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department that the pork stalls will  not  be\r\n\r\nsited  within close proximity of the beef  and  mutton\r\n\r\nstalls.  The  same  goes for cooked food  stalls.  The\r\n\r\nallocation of Muslim cooked food stalls and non-Muslim\r\n\r\ncooked  food stalls must strike a balance  to  reflect\r\n\r\nthe  local  conditions and distribution of  population\r\n\r\nwithin the area. In this way, it will attract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncustomers  and  tourists who would  like  to  frequent\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of Geylang Serai who live on a scanty\r\n\r\nlivelihood  should  be  given the  opportunity  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  this market. Besides resettling  hawkers\r\n\r\nwho  are  affected  by development  projects,  I  hope\r\n\r\nconsultation  between the Hawkers Department  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  of  Parliament for the constituency  could  be\r\n\r\nheld  as  and when necessary to complement efforts  to\r\n\r\nresolve  the  hawker  problem and  at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nupgrade the standard of the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, there are some 28,750\r\n\r\nlicensed  hawkers at the moment. Out of  this,  17,000\r\n\r\nare already sited within premises. There are still  11,750\r\n\r\nhawkers who need to be resited from the streets.\r\n\r\nWhen  are they going to be resited? What measures  are\r\n\r\nbeing   taken   to   resite  the  hawkers   in   Anson\r\n\r\nConstituency?  What  plans  are  being  drawn  up  for\r\n\r\nbuilding hawker centres in Anson Constituency?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hawkers Department says that it would not\r\n\r\nissue  any  new  licences because the  present  28,750\r\n\r\nlicensed hawkers in Singapore are sufficient to  cater\r\n\r\nfor  our population. Can the Minister say actually how\r\n\r\nmany  of  the licensees are really looking  after  the\r\n\r\nstall? It is observed that many licences have been sub-let. Why is this allowed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in some instances the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  is de-registering some of the hawkers  and\r\n\r\nasking them to go back to their place of residence for\r\n\r\ntheir business. What is the reason for this move? This\r\n\r\nwill  cause  unnecessary hardship  and  headache.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  hawkers  at  Anson  constituency  after\r\n\r\nhaving  been  in business in that place  for  over  10\r\n\r\nyears  are  told  to go to another place,  like  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah.  Is this really necessary? Is it not possible\r\n\r\nto  resite the hawkers within that particular area? Or\r\n\r\ngive   them  an  option  to  either  remain  in   that\r\n\r\nparticular  area or to be resited elsewhere.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers are really unhappy about this  move.  How\r\n\r\ncould they go to a new place to sell a product or food\r\n\r\nwhich  they have been selling in another area  for  so\r\n\r\nlong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   where   they  generally  have  their  customers'\r\n\r\ngoodwill? One way of solving this problem is  to  give\r\n\r\nan option for those who have been in business for more\r\n\r\nthan  10 years to either remain at the `existing place\r\n\r\nor go back to their place of residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures are being taken by the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  control  the  prices  charged  by  the\r\n\r\nhawkers?  I  must at this time point  out  that  price\r\n\r\ntagging  has  been implemented in many foodstalls  and\r\n\r\nhawker  centres.  Yet  the  prices  are  still  stiff.\r\n\r\nDespite   the   fact  that  the  prices   of   certain\r\n\r\ncommodities have gone down, many hawkers have made  no\r\n\r\nattempt whatsoever to either reduce the price of  food\r\n\r\nthey sell or increase the quantity of food. No one  is\r\n\r\nseen  to  check  the  price that is  being  quoted.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Enforcement Section should check  on\r\n\r\nthis,  otherwise  the people will be swindled  by  the\r\n\r\nhawkers.  Previously, a bowl of  kway  teow  costs  30\r\n\r\ncents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mee goreng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The  price  has been  increased  but  the\r\n\r\nquantity remains the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Enforcement Section must play an active role at\r\n\r\nplaces  where the hawkers find that the people are  in\r\n\r\ndemand  for  their food or drink. Thus, they  increase\r\n\r\ntheir  prices  like nobody's business. A strict  check\r\n\r\nshould be made at these places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been reported that pasar malam, a common\r\n\r\nsight  in  Singapore, is slowly being phased  out.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  many of them are being de-registered  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  told  that  their licences  would  not  be\r\n\r\nrenewed. This has brought about some hardship to  some\r\n\r\nof  them.  May  I suggest that instead of  withdrawing\r\n\r\ntheir  licences, they should be resited at some  other\r\n\r\nsuitable  place  where  there  is  no  obstruction  to\r\n\r\ntraffic.   Pasar  malam  is  a  convenient   temporary\r\n\r\nshopping  centre for many housewives and  workers  who\r\n\r\ncannot  shop in the day time.

The question I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of the Environment is whether it could  look\r\n\r\ninto the standardisation of licences At the moment the\r\n\r\nHDB's licence and the Ministry's licence are the same,\r\n\r\nbut  the stallholders' licences issued by the Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore Authority are different, I think if we could\r\n\r\nstandardise the licences it would be very  helpful  to\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of my question concerns what I have\r\n\r\nalready brought up earlier today. This is in regard to\r\n\r\nthe cooperative hawker licence for senior citizens.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Ministry to look into this  and\r\n\r\nsee  whether  it  is  feasible  to  issue  cooperative\r\n\r\nlicence  to  four or five of our old-age  citizens  so\r\n\r\nthat   they   can  operate  it  and  be   economically\r\n\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, for the past\r\n\r\nfew  years  the Hawkers Department has  put  in  great\r\n\r\nefforts  in  trying  to control unauthorised  hawkers.\r\n\r\nThis   is,   of  course, commendable  because   these\r\n\r\nunauthorised  hawkers should be got rid of;  otherwise\r\n\r\neverybody  can become a street hawker and  then  there\r\n\r\nwill  be unauthorised hawkers all over Singapore, with\r\n\r\nundesirable  consequences.  So  the  efforts  of   the\r\n\r\nHawkers Department should be commended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, when I really think of the effect of such\r\n\r\nefforts, I have the feeling that all these years  they\r\n\r\nhave wasted their time, because even up till today  we\r\n\r\ncan  still  see unauthorised hawkers in Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nthis House, we have been talking about the problem  of\r\n\r\nunauthorised hawkers quite often. Why should  this  be\r\n\r\nso?  I feel that perhaps we have not been handling the\r\n\r\nhawker  problem properly. So I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister whether there are any new plans to solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem of unauthorised hawkers in Singapore. If there\r\n\r\nis  no  new plan, I wonder how long or how many  years\r\n\r\nmore  will it take to achieve the objective of getting\r\n\r\nrid of unauthorised hawkers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to another matter. As far as I am\r\n\r\naware,  officers  of  the Hawkers Department  have  to\r\n\r\nundergo  several  months'  training  before  they  are\r\n\r\nallotted  duties in the various areas  to  handle  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  unauthorised  hawkers.  Those  who  have\r\n\r\nspecial training should actually perform well in their\r\n\r\nduties,  but  very often we hear complaints  from  the\r\n\r\npeople  against the performance of these  officers  as\r\n\r\nbeing  either unsatisfactory or conducive  to  causing\r\n\r\nresentment.  These hawker inspectors  are  often  seen\r\n\r\nchasing hawkers very rashly and rudely. These officers\r\n\r\nare  seen  in places where there is a congregation  of\r\n\r\nhawkers  or unauthorised hawkers, playing the game  of\r\n\r\nhide and seek with hawkers, They will be running after\r\n\r\nthe hawkers. Sometimes the hot pursuit by these hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors  even involve pedestrians, who are  knocked\r\n\r\ndown  and  suffer  abrasions or  they  get  a  fright.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  this kind of chase will result  in  a  big\r\n\r\nfight  in the street. Such a fight may result in court\r\n\r\ncases and in the end who suffers? The officers of  the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department seem to take a great  interest  in\r\n\r\nthis what I call \"hide and seek\" game. They even chase\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers  right into the shops and private  houses\r\n\r\nand  they even take away goods purchased by others  as\r\n\r\nexhibits or evidence against the hawkers. This is very\r\n\r\nrash  and  I  really  believe that sometimes  they  do\r\n\r\nmistake  innocent people as unauthorised  hawkers.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is such a case, this is very serious. I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Ministry  concerned  has  got  any  such\r\n\r\ninformation. If so, they should let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arising out of what I have said. I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister concerned whether  the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  any scheme or method  to  change  and\r\n\r\nimprove the discourteous manners of these officers, or\r\n\r\nwhether  there will be any effective training  courses\r\n\r\nto  rectify and correct this wrong attitude  of  these\r\n\r\nhawker inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting and Haji Sha'ari are\r\n\r\nnot here.

I\r\n\r\nhave  therefore  come across very  many  cases  weekly\r\n\r\nasking  for  hawker  licences.  However, it   is   my\r\n\r\nexperience  that more than 99% of these cases  do  not\r\n\r\nmeet with success. Whether this is a reflection of the\r\n\r\nMP's popularity with the Hawkers Department. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow. I would like to think otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it really makes me think that the conditions or\r\n\r\nstipulations for the issue of hawker licences need  to\r\n\r\nbe  redefined Sir, we are pretty aware of the three or\r\n\r\nfour  conditions which are normally stipulated: First,\r\n\r\nlicences  for  stalls will be issued  to  resettlement\r\n\r\ncases   The  second  category  comprises  the   public\r\n\r\nassistance recipients and the third category comprises\r\n\r\nthose deserving cases. Of course, all these applicants\r\n\r\nmust  be 40 years and above. Sir, I find that although\r\n\r\na  Hawkers'  Coordinating Committee has  been  formed.\r\n\r\nthere are still a certain amount of administrative  or\r\n\r\nprocedural  difficulties for  applicants.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nuncommon  for the applicants to be shuttled  from  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board Area Office to the  14th\r\n\r\nstorey   Hawkers'  Department  at  Alexandra   Circus,\r\n\r\ncausing  a  certain amount of confusion and difficulty\r\n\r\nto the applicants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on top of this, there is the issue of stalls at\r\n\r\nschool tuckshops. This has created a certain amount of\r\n\r\nconfusion.  I  would  like  the  Senior  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  advise  us as to  whether  the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment has any say whatsoever with regard  to  the\r\n\r\nissue  of licences for tuckshop stalls at schools  and\r\n\r\nwhether  the  same  guidelines apply,  I  think  there\r\n\r\nshould be a common ruling and there should be a common\r\n\r\ncommittee  where  the issue of such  licences  may  be\r\n\r\nconsidered and centralised,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the requirement that application\r\n\r\nfrom  a public assistance recipient will be considered\r\n\r\nwith  favour, I think there is a certain problem here.\r\n\r\nIt  is  my  experience, and I am sure it is shared  by\r\n\r\nseveral of my colleagues here, that many of our Asian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizens  feel that it is well below their dignity  to\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  Social Welfare Department  to  apply  for\r\n\r\npublic  assistance. We do have a good number of  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  although the persons concerned do  not  have  a\r\n\r\ncard   to   say   that  they  are  public   assistance\r\n\r\nrecipients, they are in actual fact genuinely poor and\r\n\r\ndeserve  public assistance. The clever ones would, of\r\n\r\ncourse, readily  go to the Social Welfare  Department\r\n\r\nand  get  the public assistance which is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nshortest routes to obtaining a hawker's licence. I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting, therefore, that this  is  in  a  sense  a\r\n\r\nloophole and a convenient way for some people to get a\r\n\r\nlicence.  But  on  the other hand, there  are  genuine\r\n\r\ncases  where  the  applicants should be  given  hawker\r\n\r\nlicences,  but because they are not public  assistance\r\n\r\nrecipients, and in a sense by default, they could  not\r\n\r\nvery well qualify for the issue of a hawker licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of age. I know that it\r\n\r\nis  correct to insist that the young should apply  for\r\n\r\nsome  other work and that the older people be given  a\r\n\r\nsofter and less physically demanding job like hawking.\r\n\r\nHowever,  at times we do come across some cases  where\r\n\r\nthey  may  be, say, an aged widow between  31  and  35\r\n\r\nyears   with   a  few  dependants  and,   under   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it is rather difficult for this lady to\r\n\r\ntry  to fit into the normal employment hours say, from 9.00 a.m. to 5 p.m. I hope the Hawkers Department will\r\n\r\nconsider  such  cases with favour  and  adopt  a  more\r\n\r\nrealistic and understanding approach and perhaps issue\r\n\r\nlicences to this category of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point really concerns the definition\r\n\r\nof  \"deserving cases\". We have come across cases where\r\n\r\napplicants  have been turned down on the  ground  that\r\n\r\nthe total family income is, say, $300. I would like to\r\n\r\nsay  that  lumping  together the earnings  of  various\r\n\r\nmembers of a household may not necessarily reflect the\r\n\r\ntotal  family income. Take, for example, the  case  of\r\n\r\ntwo old parents with, say, two children. It is assumed\r\n\r\nthat  in  a  sense  the earnings of  the  son  or  the\r\n\r\ndaughter  added together with the parents' income  may\r\n\r\nbe  about  $300 and that the children would contribute\r\n\r\nreadily towards the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntotal  family income. But we know that there are  many\r\n\r\nsocial  problems.  If  the children  are  not  filial,\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  have  a situation  where,  because  the\r\n\r\nchildren  do earn a certain sum of money, the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  fails  to  understand  that  they  do  not\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards the welfare of  the  family  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  then  the elderly couple are left  in  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult situation. Therefore, this leads me  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe    Hawkers'   Department   to   give   sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration  to such cases. These  old  and  elderly\r\n\r\napplicants  with  problem kids should  be  given  some\r\n\r\nleeway  and the Hawkers Department should not  be  too\r\n\r\nstingy in the issue of a hawker licence to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, time has changed. The cost of living has gone\r\n\r\nup  a fair bit over the last few years and, therefore,\r\n\r\nI  think there is a need to redefine poverty level.  I\r\n\r\nshould  hope  that  the Ministry would  consider  this\r\n\r\npoint and modify the provisions requiring a person  to\r\n\r\nprove that he or she is deserving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point is really one of asking the\r\n\r\nHawkers Department to try to help us when it comes  to\r\n\r\nthe   question  of  the  possibility  of  helping  the\r\n\r\napplicants to get hawker licences. In this respect,  I\r\n\r\nwould therefore ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  let us have some idea of his projections regarding\r\n\r\nthe  development of hawker centres or the availability\r\n\r\nof  hawker  stalls in the future, and  what  ideas  he\r\n\r\nmight have or plans he already has with regard to  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of hawker stalls to cater to the population\r\n\r\nof  two  million people, and in addition  1.5  million\r\n\r\ntourists and a floating population of 120,000 people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, several Members have raised\r\n\r\nvarious  questions touching on the Hawkers  Department\r\n\r\nunder the Ministry of the Environment. They have  made\r\n\r\ncertain criticisms, In view of the time factor, I will\r\n\r\njust give some brief answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me touch upon what the Member for\r\n\r\nKim Seng and others have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmentioned in this House over the past few days. On the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  hardship cases, briefly speaking,  the\r\n\r\nterm  includes cases where the head of the  family  is\r\n\r\nunemployed,  or  physically  incapacitated,  and   the\r\n\r\nfamily earning a total family income of not more  than\r\n\r\n$250, and   those  who  are  recipients  of   public\r\n\r\nassistance.  This  also includes certain  resettlement\r\n\r\ncases   where   the   people  are  affected   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  development  plans  but  could  not  get\r\n\r\ncompensation as farmers. All these are hardship cases.\r\n\r\nThey come under the definition of hardship cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng has mentioned another point.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he has mentioned several points. I would just\r\n\r\nlike  to  touch  upon  his point  on  the  age  limit.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, we say that the minimum age is  40\r\n\r\nyears and above. Concerning the young widows or people\r\n\r\nwho have particular difficulties financially, then  of\r\n\r\ncourse  we will give special consideration. There  are\r\n\r\nno   hard   and  fast  rules  and  strict  application\r\n\r\nregarding the rules of 40 years of age, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the total income of $250 month, it is\r\n\r\nalso not rigidly adhered to, We do give some allowance\r\n\r\nwhere the family concerned is big and is getting  more\r\n\r\nthan  this amount slightly but who have a special need\r\n\r\nto  spend  more. We will consider the merits  of  each\r\n\r\ncase  and  make a special decision or give  them  some\r\n\r\nallowance if they deserve. The principles serve mainly\r\n\r\nas guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the allocation of tuckshop stalls in the schools,\r\n\r\nthere is an allocation committee under the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation;  so this is not directly under the  control\r\n\r\nof  the  Hawkers  Department. I refer particularly  to\r\n\r\nstalls in the school tuckshops or canteens. Since many\r\n\r\nMembers   are  not  quite  familiar  with  the   point\r\n\r\nregarding the 5% of stalls allotted to certain people,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to clarify. Regarding  the  5%  stalls\r\n\r\nallotted to certain hardship cases, this only  applies\r\n\r\nto  newly  built  markets or  food  centres  on  first\r\n\r\nballoting of stalls. If there are subsequent vacancies\r\n\r\nin  these new markets or food centres or in respect of\r\n\r\nold  markets,  then such cases are not within  the  5%\r\n\r\nscope.  They  do  not  come  under  the  scope  of  5%\r\n\r\nallocation of stalls any more. Maybe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome   people  will  ask  why  in  recent  years   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been so strict in issuing licences  to\r\n\r\nhawkers.  The  main reason is that for  the  long-term\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the Government we want all  the  open  air\r\n\r\nhawkers to move into sheltered hawker centres in order\r\n\r\nto achieve our anti-pollution policy. It is also meant\r\n\r\nto raise our standard of public hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members are aware that the cost of\r\n\r\nconstructing  new markets/food centres  has  increased\r\n\r\nwith  the average cost per stall ranging from  $10,000\r\n\r\nto  $15,000. So under these circumstances, we have  to\r\n\r\nconsider this matter carefully. Some Members have also\r\n\r\nasked  whether we should increase the 5% stalls  to  a\r\n\r\nhigher percentage. After my explanation I believe they\r\n\r\ncan  understand that at the moment it is not necessary\r\n\r\nor  not  possible  to raise the 5% allocation  in  new\r\n\r\nmarkets  to a higher percentage. We will not  give  it\r\n\r\nany prior consideration for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter touched upon by the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  relates  to  the work of our  department.  He\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  attitude of certain hawker  inspectors\r\n\r\nwhen  carrying out their duty and asked  whether  they\r\n\r\nare  given a period of training. Here I would like  to\r\n\r\nexplain  in detail so that they can understand better.\r\n\r\nWhen  new staff are recruited, everyone of them  would\r\n\r\nbe  sent for a period of at least half a year  in  the\r\n\r\nbasic  principles of dealing with the public so as  to\r\n\r\nget  them familiar with public relations. Not only new\r\n\r\nrecruits  are  trained, but also old and senior  staff\r\n\r\nare  sent  for refresher course in the hope that  this\r\n\r\nwill raise their efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a fact we should recognise is\r\n\r\nthat  all  those officers concerned with the  work  of\r\n\r\nenforcement,  are carrying out difficult  tasks.  They\r\n\r\nhave  to face occupational hazards. When carrying  out\r\n\r\ntheir  duty  they  are  usually faced  with  difficult\r\n\r\nsituations. It is quite risky in certain circumstances\r\n\r\nand the public do not understand them well. While they\r\n\r\nare  faced  with  various difficulties,  they  do  not\r\n\r\nreceive any psychological encouragement at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, there have been frequent resignations  from\r\n\r\nthese  people. So sometimes it is difficult for us  to\r\n\r\narrange such staff for our work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking. I can say that we have already\r\n\r\nachieved  our  purpose or objective  in  tackling  the\r\n\r\nhawker  problem. Of course, there cannot be perfection\r\n\r\nall round. Certain problems still remain to be solved.\r\n\r\nIt  is only natural. I also said that in dealing  with\r\n\r\nunlicensed  hawkers, there could be unpleasant  scenes\r\n\r\nand  sometimes even fighting would take place. But the\r\n\r\nloser will not only be the unlicensed hawkers but also\r\n\r\nour  staff. Some of our staff have suffered injury  in\r\n\r\nsuch  incidents.  Some  even had  to  undergo  medical\r\n\r\ntreatment  for quite some time. What has come  to  our\r\n\r\nnotice  is that some foreigners were involved  in  the\r\n\r\nincidents. So in this respect, we have to enforce  our\r\n\r\nlaw and protect our citizens' benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked whether markets will\r\n\r\nbe built in Anson constituency or whether food centres\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  built  there.  Verbally,  though   not\r\n\r\nofficially, the Member for Punggol has also  mentioned\r\n\r\nabout similar questions as to whether markets or  food\r\n\r\ncentres  will be built in his constituency.  My  reply\r\n\r\nhere is, taking Anson constituency for example, it  is\r\n\r\nin  an  urban area and there are already some  markets\r\n\r\nthere.  As to whether there is a need to build  a  new\r\n\r\nmarket  there, it has to depend on future  development\r\n\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Member for Punggol has not made any\r\n\r\nofficial request, for his information I would say that\r\n\r\nin  Punggol constituency perhaps it is easier  to  get\r\n\r\nthe  necessary land, As to whether the  site  will  be\r\n\r\nsuitable,  again  it will have to  depend  on  further\r\n\r\ndiscussion  and study. If the Member concerned  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  it  is necessary and there is a proper  site  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a market or food centre in his constituency.  I\r\n\r\nhope he will raise the matter with us and we will give\r\n\r\nit serious consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised two points. First.\r\n\r\nhe hopes that we will control the hawker prices or fix\r\n\r\nthe prices of food sold by them in order to be fair to\r\n\r\nthe customers. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoubt  whether it would be fair to the hawkers  to  do\r\n\r\nso, because  they  get  their  supplies   from   the\r\n\r\nmerchants. So the prices are not within their control.\r\n\r\nTo  ask  the hawkers to sell at certain prices is  not\r\n\r\npractical.  Prices fluctuate according to  the  market\r\n\r\nsituation. I think it may suffice if they label  their\r\n\r\nprices themselves if they want to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards subletting of hawker licences, we are\r\n\r\npaying  attention to this matter. If  there  are  such\r\n\r\nirregular practices, then we will take steps to cancel\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers'  licences of the persons  concerned.  We\r\n\r\nwill not allow such things to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards pasar malam, last week I said in this\r\n\r\nHouse, when we receive complaints against  the  pasar\r\n\r\nmalam  stallholders  we cannot do otherwise  but  take\r\n\r\naction   against   them.   Nevertheless, for   their\r\n\r\nlivelihood,  we  will try to allocate stalls  in  some\r\n\r\nmarkets or food centres for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, several points were raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai. As regards the new market at Haig  Road\r\n\r\nhow  many  stalls  are  there and  how  many  will  be\r\n\r\nallotted to Muslim stallholders and how many  to  non-Muslim  stallholders, my answer is that  in  this  new\r\n\r\nmarket  there are altogether 218 stalls, of which  146\r\n\r\nare  stalls for the sale of meat, vegetables and daily\r\n\r\nconsumer goods. The other 72 are meant for the sale of\r\n\r\ncooked  food.  As regards how many stalls  are  to  be\r\n\r\nallocated  to  Muslim stallholders and  to  non-Muslim\r\n\r\nstallholders, it will have to depend on the number  of\r\n\r\nstallholders that will be moved into this market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the separation of stalls selling\r\n\r\nbeef  and  mutton  from  those selling  pork  with  an\r\n\r\nappreciable distance between them. Of course,  it  has\r\n\r\nalways  been the Government's policy to separate  them\r\n\r\nwell  from each other. So we will again properly apply\r\n\r\nthe same policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point the Member raised is that when a new\r\n\r\nmarket  is  to  be  opened, whether the  MP  for  that\r\n\r\nconstituency  will  be invited  to  officiate  at  the\r\n\r\nopening  ceremony. This again falls within  our  usual\r\n\r\npolicy. Whenever a new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket  is  to  be  opened,  we  will  invite  the  MP\r\n\r\nconcerned  in that area to discuss among other  things\r\n\r\nmatters  relating  to the opening  of  the  market.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the  market officials  and  the  people\r\n\r\ninvolved with that market have already themselves seen\r\n\r\nthe MP concerned about related matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, as regards the Member for Telok Blangah's\r\n\r\npoint about closer liaison between the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  and the statutory boards, like  the  JTC.\r\n\r\nPSA,  the  HDB  in order to have some kind  of  common\r\n\r\npolicy in dealing with hawkers, I will say that  these\r\n\r\nfour establishments had already in July 1975 set up  a\r\n\r\nHawkers   Coordinating  and  Licensing  Committee   to\r\n\r\nharmonise  mutual  policies  in  order  to  unify  the\r\n\r\nrespective policies so that in future there will be  a\r\n\r\ncommon  policy to deal with hawkers' problems  and  we\r\n\r\nhave now more or less achieved this objective. But  in\r\n\r\nview  of different backgrounds, there would be certain\r\n\r\ndifferences  in  the  actual  implementation  of   the\r\n\r\npolicy. So it is not easy to change the situation in a\r\n\r\nshort  time.  However,  we  are  trying  our  best  to\r\n\r\novercome these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally - I have used this word so many times\r\n\r\nalready  -  the Member also asked whether the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment can issue a joint or co-operative  hawker's\r\n\r\nlicence  for  several people or a group of  people  to\r\n\r\noperate a stall jointly. In principle, it may be  good\r\n\r\nfor  a  society,  but  administratively  it  will   be\r\n\r\ndifficult,  because there is the possible  problem  of\r\n\r\nsubletting.  Normally we issue licences to individuals\r\n\r\nand not to groups of persons. So for the time being we\r\n\r\ncannot  accept this suggestion. I think I have replied\r\n\r\nto all the questions raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Point of clarification, Sir, Earlier\r\n\r\nI  have indicated to you, Sir, that I was not going to\r\n\r\nspeak   on   the  amendment,  but  since  the   Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment has made reference to the point that I was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  ask  him  a  question with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\npossibility of the construction of a hawker centre and\r\n\r\nnot a market in my constituency. I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchanged my mind and wish to speak on it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punggol Estate has a market with a hawker centre\r\n\r\ncomprising  30 cooked food stalls. I noted  that  this\r\n\r\nwas  insufficient. So I had occasion to speak  to  him\r\n\r\nthat I intended to raise this matter, and in his reply\r\n\r\nhe  preempted my intention. But since he has been kind\r\n\r\nto give me that reply which I did not ask for, I would\r\n\r\nlike not only to thank him but ask him or his Ministry\r\n\r\nwhether  a  hawker centre will be built in  that  area\r\n\r\nshould a suitable site be found in my constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, at the present\r\n\r\nmoment there is no plan in my Ministry to build a  new\r\n\r\nhawker  centre in Punggol, but if the Member concerned\r\n\r\ncan  propose  a suitable site we will make  a  serious\r\n\r\nstudy of his proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I asked about licences for old\r\n\r\npeople  because  under the present policy  old  people\r\n\r\nwithout any school going dependants do not qualify for\r\n\r\na  hawker  licence.

All I am asking is, can the Ministry  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  possibility of issuing hawker  licences  to\r\n\r\nthese  old  people.

Where are the markets? There is only one\r\n\r\nmarket  at  Maxwell  Road. I am talking  about  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.  There  are  so many  hawkers  in  the  Anson\r\n\r\nconstituency.  Why do they not want  to  resite  these\r\n\r\nhawkers  in  a hawker centre? The Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  does not always give a proper reply  to  my\r\n\r\nquestion. I want a proper reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the past\r\n\r\nthere was perhaps one market in Maxwell Road in Anson.\r\n\r\nNow  as  the Anson constituency has been enlarged,  he\r\n\r\nnow has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  markets which include the PSA markets.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase  if the Member for Anson feels there is a further\r\n\r\nneed for a new market, as I have already said, then we\r\n\r\nhave  to  consider it in the light of any  development\r\n\r\nplan  for the constituency. If he has a suitable  site\r\n\r\nto propose then we will certainly consider it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

Whenever  I ask a question  of  the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary, he never  gives  a  complete\r\n\r\nanswer.  He gives an answer as he wishes.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nfair   request  that  I  am  asking.  We  are  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people and therefore I am  here\r\n\r\nto  request  the  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of my people to look after their interests.  We\r\n\r\nare entitled to have proper answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I did not get a\r\n\r\ntranslation of the earlier part of the Member's speech\r\n\r\nin  Tamil but I have the latter part of it. The Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson was saying that we have a responsibility  to\r\n\r\nlook  for  a site for a hawker centre. I have  already\r\n\r\nstated earlier that in the short term we have no plans\r\n\r\nto   build   a   new  hawker  centre  in   the   Anson\r\n\r\nconstituency. Since the Member for Anson  has  been  a\r\n\r\nMember for Anson for such a long time, he should  know\r\n\r\nhis constituency very well. So if he has any idea I am\r\n\r\nsure  his idea will be very much better than the civil\r\n\r\nservants' idea. I would like to appeal to him that  if\r\n\r\nhe  or  his CCC feels that there is any suitable site,\r\n\r\nwe will give it very serious consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, that is not my\r\n\r\nduty.  That is his duty. He has the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nselecting a place. He must ask the Government to get a\r\n\r\nplace  to build the hawker centre. Will he give  us  a\r\n\r\nplace when we ask for it? If we select a vacant place,\r\n\r\nwill  he  build  us a hawker centre? If  we  select  a\r\n\r\ncorner at Maxwell Road, or a carpark, will he build  a\r\n\r\nhawker  centre for us? Please tell us. It is no  point\r\n\r\ntalking. We must have action. Yes, I have been serving\r\n\r\nmy constituency for a long time. He has also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  serving  in  that  Ministry  for  a  long  time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he should also be conversant. Now the Anson\r\n\r\nconstituency has been enlarged. I agree. But there  is\r\n\r\nonly  one  hawker centre. We need more hawker centres,\r\n\r\nTherefore I repeatedly request him for a hawker centre\r\n\r\nin my constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson says that we have to look for a site. Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  have been looking for a site all the time. He said\r\n\r\nthat  if  he  were to select a place at  a  corner  of\r\n\r\nMaxwell Road, or at the cross-roads, an important  and\r\n\r\nbusy traffic junction, whether we will be prepared  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  hawker centre there. The question of putting\r\n\r\nup  a  hawker  centre is not decided  by  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nalone. I am sure the Member for Anson knows well  that\r\n\r\nbefore any planning approval is granted, it has to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  several relevant Ministries. It is only  when\r\n\r\nthere  is  a concurrence of ideas between the  various\r\n\r\nDepartments   and   officers   concerned   that    the\r\n\r\nconstruction will be approved. So it is  not  for  one\r\n\r\nparticular   Ministry  to  decide  on  a  construction\r\n\r\nproject.  We  have  to  consider  the  overall  common\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the people. It is not as  simple  as  he\r\n\r\nsays, that so long as he selects a place we can put  a\r\n\r\nhawker centre. The matter is not so simple as that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Therefore, it  is  his  duty  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a hawker centre, wherever a place is available.\r\n\r\nIt  is his duty. It is not my duty.

The Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  has  told  this House  just  now  that  the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department has conducted courses for its  new\r\n\r\nofficers.  We  have  frequently heard  in  this  House\r\n\r\ncomplaints  that the Hawker Inspectors are very  harsh\r\n\r\nin  their  attitude,  particularly towards  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers  when they would behave rashly in  the  public\r\n\r\neye,  as stated by the Member for Bukit Panjang.  Even\r\n\r\nin  their dealings with licensed hawkers, they  behave\r\n\r\nin  the  same  way  and in a very high-handed  manner.\r\n\r\nSometimes they are very unreasonable. So I would  like\r\n\r\nto ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary what kind of\r\n\r\ntraining  courses  do  they  conduct,  what  are   the\r\n\r\ncontents of the courses, where are such courses  held,\r\n\r\nand  whether there is any requirement for  the  Hawker\r\n\r\nInspector  to  sit  in  and  observe  the  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament during their meet-the-people sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong asked about the contents of the courses.

In a big Ministry  it  may  be\r\n\r\npossible  that  one  or  two  officers  may  have   so\r\n\r\nconducted themselves as to cause misunderstanding.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Jurong welcomes our officers  to  his\r\n\r\nmeet-the-people sessions, we are prepared to send them\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in answering my\r\n\r\nquestion  just now the Senior Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nsaid  that there were instances of fighting  when  the\r\n\r\nhawker inspectors were enforcing the law.
