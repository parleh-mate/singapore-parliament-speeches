For this reason, I have\r\n\r\nmade  provision last year for the purchase of  a  new\r\n\r\ntransmitter of 20 kilowatts to take the place of  the\r\n\r\nold  one  of  only 10 kilowatts.

Therefore,  heavy\r\n\r\nrainfall  coinciding  with a  high  tide  will  cause\r\n\r\nflooding in these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the Rochore Canal embankments, as suggested\r\n\r\nby  the  hon.

Therefore, unless control flap gates  at  the\r\n\r\ndischarge ends of culverts and drains are built,  the\r\n\r\nwater  from the canal could flow into the surrounding\r\n\r\nareas.  If  these  flap gates are  built  and  closed\r\n\r\nduring heavy rainfall, the rain water in these  areas\r\n\r\ncannot  flow into the canal. If there is a high  tide\r\n\r\ncoinciding with heavy rainfall and the flap gates are\r\n\r\nopened, the water in the canal will be pushed by  the\r\n\r\ntide and flow back into these low-lying areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate widening of the canal as suggested by the\r\n\r\nhon.

Approval of the Phase 1  Scheme\r\n\r\ninvolves  the construction of an entirely  new  canal\r\n\r\nwhich  will  divert the storm water from Upper  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  and Sungei Namly catchments, starting at about\r\n\r\nthe  6th  milestone Bukit Timah Road to join up  with\r\n\r\nSungei  Ulu Pandan.

I have in mind the possibility that\r\n\r\nthe person placed on the national service reserve may\r\n\r\nbe  placed  at a disadvantage in respect of promotion\r\n\r\nopportunities  as a result of his military  training.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  such military training requirements,  he\r\n\r\nmay  not be able to carry out over-time work  in  his\r\n\r\ncompany whenever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequested  to  do so by his supervisors.  Because  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a situation, the management may place him in  a\r\n\r\nsection  of the firm which does not carry much  over-time requirements and, thereby, offers much less hope\r\n\r\nfor  promotion. Even if he is not required to perform\r\n\r\novertime  duties, the management, at the  same  time,\r\n\r\nmay be irritated to a certain extent by the fact that\r\n\r\nsuch employee is compelled to take time off from work\r\n\r\nand  may, naturally, react to such irritation by  not\r\n\r\nactively considering such employee for any vacancy in\r\n\r\na  higher  post whenever any such vacancy arises.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be a sort of half-hearted compensation,  if  I\r\n\r\nmay  say so, for such employee to be assured  of  his\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  employment but, at the  same  time,  to\r\n\r\nsuffer  a  certain degree of prejudice in his  career\r\n\r\nprospects as far as his firm is concerned. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether it is implied in the assurance  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to those who are required to be called  up\r\n\r\nfor  national service - that this assurance of a  job\r\n\r\nto all who are called up applies equally to those who\r\n\r\nalready  have a job in a private firm,  so  that  any\r\n\r\nperson,  whose  career  may  be  prejudiced  by   his\r\n\r\nmilitary  duty,  will be given an opportunity  for  a\r\n\r\nhigher job which he would otherwise have obtained  if\r\n\r\nit had not been for his national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, on the National Service (Amendment) Bill,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that our brave Colonel should not be afraid  of\r\n\r\nmy  raising any question on this Bill, as it concerns\r\n\r\nthe  life  and  death  of  the  nation,  and  it   is\r\n\r\nintroduced at a time when the Communist united  front\r\n\r\nis  struggling. On the other hand, Britain is  trying\r\n\r\nto  cut down her troops and manpower in Singapore. So\r\n\r\nthe introduction of this Bill at this juncture is  of\r\n\r\nspecial significance, because it symbolises the  fact\r\n\r\nthat the people of Singapore will be able to feel and\r\n\r\nappreciate the end of colonial rule and that  we  are\r\n\r\nreally independent in the true sense of the word.  If\r\n\r\nwe  were still under colonial rule, then our colonial\r\n\r\nmasters   would   still   shoulder   their   military\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  to protect their own  interests  in\r\n\r\nthis region. Therefore, while they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrolled  the military power in this  region,  they\r\n\r\nwould not be able to carry out the job properly.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  if  they  wanted  the  people  to  take  up\r\n\r\nnational   service,  they  would  meet   with   great\r\n\r\ndifficulties and troubles. That was why some 10 years\r\n\r\nago  in  Singapore there was the May  13th  incident.\r\n\r\nThis  took  place  in a very abnormal  situation  and\r\n\r\nunder  very strange circumstances. The facts  of  the\r\n\r\nriots  that  took  place  then  were  distorted   and\r\n\r\nexploited by some quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the colonial rulers, we have inherited a\r\n\r\nsituation in which we do not have sufficient military\r\n\r\npower. We have inherited a very weak and feeble civil\r\n\r\nservice. We have not been given a very brave,  strong\r\n\r\nand  rugged military establishment. This Bill,  which\r\n\r\nis  now  introduced  about a year  or  so  after  our\r\n\r\nindependence,   throws  some  more   light   on   the\r\n\r\nindependence  of  Singapore in that  we  are  now  in\r\n\r\ncharge of the defence of our own country. If we  were\r\n\r\nstill under colonial rule, we would not be given  the\r\n\r\nfull  attention  and care that we deserve.  In  those\r\n\r\ndays, our colonial masters would not be able to fully\r\n\r\nimplement national service. At that time,  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nstudents   applied  for  postponement  from  military\r\n\r\nservice,  and they fought very hard to get  it.  They\r\n\r\nthought they could get some kind of postponement. But\r\n\r\nnow,  in introducing this Bill, we have already  made\r\n\r\nconcrete    proposals    for   its    implementation.\r\n\r\nRegulations  have  already been  drawn  up  to  grant\r\n\r\nfacilities  to those students who want to  apply  for\r\n\r\npostponement on valid grounds. This goes to show that\r\n\r\nan  independent government is entirely different from\r\n\r\na colonial government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to go on to another point. We can see that a\r\n\r\nlot  of  people  feel  that Singapore  is  completely\r\n\r\nindefensible.  There  is nothing  for  which  we  can\r\n\r\nfight. We cannot hope to triumph in any battle at all\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Sometimes we can see in the newspapers\r\n\r\nreports  about  military pacts entered  into  between\r\n\r\nMalaysia   and  the  United  Kingdom.  Singapore   is\r\n\r\nregarded as a small island, like the Isle of Man,  at\r\n\r\nthe southern tip\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the Malay Peninsula. It is only a very small piece\r\n\r\nof  land. It has no military significance and  value,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  completely indefensible.  This  kind  of\r\n\r\nargument  seems to have underestimated  the  military\r\n\r\nvalue and strategic position of Singapore. It is  not\r\n\r\nentirely  correct.  If it is said that  our  military\r\n\r\npower  is not sufficient to carry out any aggression,\r\n\r\nof  course, I will agree. In fact, it is not our  aim\r\n\r\nto  mobilise our people in order to raise an army and\r\n\r\ngo  north,  south, east or west. We do not have  such\r\n\r\naggressive intentions at all. Our main aim is centred\r\n\r\non defence, and defence only. As a matter of fact,  a\r\n\r\nsmall  island  like Singapore has,  historically,  no\r\n\r\nintention of any aggression at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 700 years ago there was aggression from Java,\r\n\r\nand  recently Japan also invaded Singapore.  We  were\r\n\r\noccupied   by  Japan  and  became  the   victims   of\r\n\r\naggression. But there is no intention on  our  record\r\n\r\nto  say that we have invaded any other place at  all.\r\n\r\nSo  even if we have a strong army, we do not have any\r\n\r\nexperience of invading others, or have any aggressive\r\n\r\nintentions. Singapore controls traffic in the Straits\r\n\r\nof  Malacca in a region of some 600 miles. It is  the\r\n\r\ngateway from the East to the West, and vice versa. It\r\n\r\nis  the centre of the trade route of South-east  Asia\r\n\r\nconnecting    Australia   and   New   Zealand.    So,\r\n\r\nstrategically   speaking,  we  become   a   bone   of\r\n\r\ncontention in times of war, although we may not  have\r\n\r\nany  aggressive intentions of any kind. But we cannot\r\n\r\ndeny,  or  under-estimate, or overlook  the  military\r\n\r\nvalue  and  importance  of  Singapore  strategically.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not going to invade anybody, we  must\r\n\r\nnot be weak-kneed. We must not be cowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the military aspect, there is also\r\n\r\nthe  social aspect to be considered. Singapore has  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of  about  two million.  If  we  want  to\r\n\r\nstabilise the situation in Singapore, we must have  a\r\n\r\nvery closely-knit society before we can survive.  The\r\n\r\nNational Service (Amendment) Bill provides a  certain\r\n\r\nsignificance in this respect in that attempts can  be\r\n\r\nmade  to  mobilise the people so as to bring about  a\r\n\r\nclosely-knit society. At the same time, we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  bear in mind that we have no resources other than\r\n\r\nmanpower. The people in the age group of 18 or so are\r\n\r\neven  more valuable in terms of manpower, and we must\r\n\r\nmake  full  use of these resources and make  all  the\r\n\r\npeople responds to the national service call. To this\r\n\r\nextent,  I feel that if we can fully tap the youthful\r\n\r\nenergies  of  our people and make use of  the  spring\r\n\r\nsource of our nation, then it is in keeping with  the\r\n\r\naspirations  of our people and we can create  a  very\r\n\r\nbright future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to go into is this. Although\r\n\r\nwe call this national service, it must, of necessity,\r\n\r\nbe  connected with the nation, which, in the eyes  of\r\n\r\nthe  Communists, cannot stand on its own, because the\r\n\r\nCommunists themselves have no national consciousness.\r\n\r\nIf they are to follow Marx, Engels or anybody of that\r\n\r\nkind, they will try to make use of class conflict  or\r\n\r\nstruggle  by  which  they will try  to  suppress  the\r\n\r\npeople and make use of the class struggle as a weapon\r\n\r\nto  suppress the people and to destroy the nation  as\r\n\r\ntheir  ultimate aim. They will start the rule of  the\r\n\r\nproletariat instead. We must, of necessity, give vent\r\n\r\nto  the spirit of democracy so as to protect our  way\r\n\r\nof  life. To do this, I personally feel that we  must\r\n\r\ntake  the opportunity to review the policies  of  the\r\n\r\nDefence  Ministry.  For example, the  inculcation  of\r\n\r\nnational consciousness is a very important job. I  do\r\n\r\nnot know whether it has already been accomplished. In\r\n\r\nthe Officers' Mess of the People's Defence Force,  we\r\n\r\nhave  not seen the reflection of society in the  rank\r\n\r\nand  file. Although it is said that the men and  boys\r\n\r\nare   supposed  to  have  come  from  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety,  we are unable to see any Chinese  newspaper\r\n\r\nor  national language newspaper. Nor are our military\r\n\r\nsongs  sung  in  the Malay language or  the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage.  In the regular forces, we understand  that\r\n\r\nthey  are using a kind of trumpet, instead of a bell,\r\n\r\nto  inform the people of meal times. Up to date we do\r\n\r\nnot have any military songs in the national language.\r\n\r\nSo  the  People's Defence Force has not done its  own\r\n\r\npart  in  bringing about a greater sense of  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf an explanation can be given, I shall be very happy\r\n\r\nto hear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that we are Back-benchers in the\r\n\r\nruling Party and we have some personal experience  in\r\n\r\nmilitary service and we have undergone a certain kind\r\n\r\nof  training. The people from our ruling  Party  must\r\n\r\nset  a good example by joining national service. This\r\n\r\nwill  nail  the  lies  and the smears  of  the  anti-national  elements who say that we are hiding  behind\r\n\r\nthe  people who are used as cannon fodder. So we must\r\n\r\nset a good example at the very beginning. We must put\r\n\r\nourselves  in  uniform first. From the  branches  and\r\n\r\nheadquarters  of our Party, we must come  forward  in\r\n\r\nuniform to show the people that we are setting a good\r\n\r\nexample. I do not know whether the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nhas given some thought to this aspect so that he will\r\n\r\nnot  receive undue criticism. I hope some explanation\r\n\r\nwill be forthcoming in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, when we call up the\r\n\r\npeople for national service, we must not be very much\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the payment of allowances  or  other\r\n\r\nremunerations, otherwise it would appear that we  are\r\n\r\nengaging employees to do a job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  national service is the necessary  preparation\r\n\r\nthrough  rigid discipline, military or otherwise,  of\r\n\r\nthe citizens for duty to the nation. This service  in\r\n\r\ndefence of the community undoubtedly can be termed  a\r\n\r\nnoble duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Republic, though barely older than two years,\r\n\r\nhas  made great strides in the housing and industrial\r\n\r\nfields,  and  socially,  too,  has  yet  to  mould  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  of varied racial origins into  one  nation\r\n\r\npossessing  the  spirit  of  national  consciousness.\r\n\r\nHowever,  our assets are the youths and I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been wise to note this and exploit  it\r\n\r\nto  the  country's  full benefit.  The  slogan,  \"The\r\n\r\nyouths  of  today  are the leaders  of  tomorrow\"  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  true.  Through  the  youths,  we   must\r\n\r\ncultivate national consciousness and other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalues  of  social responsibility which are essential\r\n\r\nand   which  we  desire  to  instill  in  our  entire\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Bill, national service means\r\n\r\nservice  in  the  Army, People's Defence  Force,  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Constabulary and the Vigilante Corps. It also\r\n\r\nsets  out the age groups to be called up and how long\r\n\r\nthey are required to serve full-time as well as part-\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the number of important amendments to the\r\n\r\nNational Service Ordinance, 1952, of Malaysia in  its\r\n\r\napplication to Singapore is one in which powers  will\r\n\r\nbe vested in the Minister who may \"from time to time,\r\n\r\nby notice in the Gazette\" call up youths for national\r\n\r\nservice.  Therefore,  any  proclamation  for  call-up\r\n\r\nwould  be  done  by  the  Minister  instead  of   the\r\n\r\nPresident being required to proclaim it. I  shall  be\r\n\r\nglad  if the Minister of Defence can explain why such\r\n\r\na prerogative will now be vested in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is about the age groups to be called\r\n\r\nup.  According  to this Bill, 18 year-olds  would  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  serve  two years full-time  and  twelve\r\n\r\nyears part-time. I am glad to note that jobs would be\r\n\r\nawaiting  them upon their completion of the  two-year\r\n\r\nfull-time  service.  This is noteworthy  in  that  it\r\n\r\ngives security to these youths who will not be unduly\r\n\r\nworried over employment when called upon to serve the\r\n\r\ncountry for two years full-time and ultimately twelve\r\n\r\nyears part-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would be grateful if the Minister would\r\n\r\nkindly  inform this House how many youths  would  the\r\n\r\nten  per cent constitute, and what expenditure  would\r\n\r\nbe expended on this matter. Furthermore, would it not\r\n\r\nbe wiser if the Government, instead of calling up the\r\n\r\n18  year-olds, extend the age group, say, from 18  to\r\n\r\n25?  I  am suggesting this because, in this  way,  we\r\n\r\nwould  be able to equip our youths with the necessary\r\n\r\ntraining by which the development of spirit,  bearing\r\n\r\nand skill would be more beneficial to the country  as\r\n\r\na   whole   and  in  which  the  spirit  of  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness would be further instilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  this  would meet the requirement of a small  and\r\n\r\nnewly   independent   nation  like   Singapore   - the\r\n\r\npreparedness  that  would  ensure  the  survival  and\r\n\r\ncontinued progress of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we know very well that a good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  these  18 year-olds have  left  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  and  many are pursuing higher education.  In\r\n\r\nthis  respect, will the Minister concerned see to  it\r\n\r\nthat  whilst  they  are undergoing national  service,\r\n\r\ntheir  educational pursuits will not be impeded?  And\r\n\r\nfor  those  in  the higher institutions of  learning,\r\n\r\nwould  it  not be feasible to group these  conscripts\r\n\r\nand  place them under centralised training at a place\r\n\r\ncloser  to  them  whereby minimum time  is  spent  on\r\n\r\ntransport so that no cause for complaint would  arise\r\n\r\non  the  question of their studies being hampered  or\r\n\r\nimpeded  because  they have to  spend  much  time  in\r\n\r\ntravelling to and from their place of training?  This\r\n\r\naspect  of  training, of course, refers  to  military\r\n\r\ntraining  for  which allowances  are  paid  to  cover\r\n\r\ntransport  charges and laundry charges  for  uniforms\r\n\r\nissued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Bill clearly states, persons \"not\r\n\r\nbeing  less than eighteen years of age\" and  who  are\r\n\r\nliable  to  register  under this Ordinance  shall  be\r\n\r\nliable  to  be called up for service in the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps.  We  all know the usefulness of the  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps and the notable work they have done in the past\r\n\r\n2\u00ab   years.  The  Government,  whilst  realising  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of the Vigilante Corps, has seen  fit  to\r\n\r\ninclude  service in it as part and parcel of national\r\n\r\nservice. I gather that the Vigilante Corps have  been\r\n\r\nformed  at  community centre levels  and  that  their\r\n\r\nduties  are mainly to patrol the kampongs  and  along\r\n\r\nthe  shores. These members are doing an admirable job\r\n\r\nand  we  have  come across occasions  when  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  members have helped to apprehend burglars  and\r\n\r\nthieves, prevented illegal immigrants and performed a\r\n\r\nhost  of public-spirited duties. They are doing  this\r\n\r\npurely on a voluntary basis and this displays a  high\r\n\r\nspirit  of social responsibility. It is also manifest\r\n\r\nthat they are not paid any allowance when they go on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduty   except  when  the  management  committees   of\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres have to foot the bill  for  coffee\r\n\r\nand  titbits.  It has been suggested  that  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps members be paid a token sum of money as enjoyed\r\n\r\nby  volunteers  in the Special Constabulary  and  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Defence Force. I support this suggestion and\r\n\r\nno  doubt  the Minister concerned may argue  and  say\r\n\r\nthat  the Vigilante Corps members enjoy a wider range\r\n\r\nof  recreational facilities. But I must  stress  that\r\n\r\nthe other forces have such facilities, too. Moreover,\r\n\r\nservice  in  the  Vigilante Corps would  be  national\r\n\r\nservice, too, and I think it is only fair that  those\r\n\r\nwho would be required to serve in the Vigilante Corps\r\n\r\nbe paid a nominal sum when they go on duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the Bill in general, we all\r\n\r\nknow  that  national  service exists  in  almost  all\r\n\r\ncountries   in  the  world.  It  is  the  fundamental\r\n\r\nresponsibility of every citizen to answer the call of\r\n\r\nnational  service,  if we do not take  the  necessary\r\n\r\nsteps  to protect ourselves from the enemies  of  our\r\n\r\nnation  in  order  to be able to live  in  peace  and\r\n\r\nsecurity, I do not think anybody, or any country  for\r\n\r\nthat  matter,  can guarantee our freedom,  unless  we\r\n\r\nwish  to  be subjects of another country!  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink this is what the people of Singapore want!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, being a small independent country,\r\n\r\nstands on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and\r\n\r\nit  is  situated  in a position of immense  strategic\r\n\r\nimportance. Therefore, it is only right  and  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people and country  that  we  must\r\n\r\nnever  allow  ourselves to be caught  unprepared,  as\r\n\r\nwhat  happened  in  the Second  World  War  when  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  invaded Singapore. Hence the  necessity  of\r\n\r\nhaving  a body of disciplined fighting force able  to\r\n\r\nrotect life and property and most important of all -\r\n\r\nthe  survival of the country -the existence  of  this\r\n\r\ntiny  island  State in this corner of  the  turbulent\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that if a country shows\r\n\r\nverve,  grit and determination to survive,  she  will\r\n\r\nnot  be molested. The stakes will be too high and the\r\n\r\nprice too heavy to pay if we are a passive lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the character of our community is such\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is a rootless society. Her races  are\r\n\r\nof   varied  migrant  origins.  Those  who  came   to\r\n\r\nSingapore  more than a century ago did not intend  to\r\n\r\nmake Singapore their home and country. But they have,\r\n\r\nover  a  period of more than a century,  left  behind\r\n\r\nwell  over two million people who today make  up  the\r\n\r\npopulation of the Republic of Singapore. The rootless\r\n\r\nand  disorganised society of yesterday will thus have\r\n\r\nto  be  an organised society of today. This is unique\r\n\r\nin the history of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, we are now independent and I am\r\n\r\nsure  that  all will agree with me when  I  say  that\r\n\r\nthere is no place for us to go to if we are told  off\r\n\r\nby   a   stronger  neighbour.  Hence  the   paramount\r\n\r\nimportance  of our Republic to organise a society  in\r\n\r\nwhich  there  exists a sense of social responsibility\r\n\r\nand national consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So national service will be implemented in the very\r\n\r\nnear  future.  I  do  not  think  anybody  today   in\r\n\r\nSingapore will be against it. More than a decade ago,\r\n\r\npeople  did  not  understand  the  reasons  for  such\r\n\r\nservice, and thus the Communists were able to exploit\r\n\r\nthe  issue, resulting in the call-up being a failure.\r\n\r\nToday   the   situation  is  entirely  changed.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  young  men and women  have  responded  far\r\n\r\nbeyond  expectations by joining the People's  Defence\r\n\r\nForce and the People's Defence Force (Women). I would\r\n\r\ntherefore  suggest  to  the  Minister  concerned   to\r\n\r\nincrease  the intake to, say, 50 per cent instead  of\r\n\r\n10 per cent of the youths to be called up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if national service continues for ten\r\n\r\nyears  during  which time an organised  society  will\r\n\r\nemerge, Singapore then will be a changed place  where\r\n\r\nher  citizens  will not only live in  confidence  and\r\n\r\npride  but  the Republic will also last  as  long  as\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in summing up, I would urge all youths\r\n\r\nwho  are liable to be called up to rise at once  with\r\n\r\none  voice  and respond to this call of duty  to  the\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity to say a  few  words  on  the\r\n\r\nNational Service (Amendment) Bill which is now before\r\n\r\nthe  House for its Second Reading? This Bill provides\r\n\r\nfor  the  conscription of potential manpower  of  our\r\n\r\nIsland   Republic  which  has  been   hitherto   left\r\n\r\nuntapped.  True indeed that during the 140  years  of\r\n\r\ncolonial rule and the short-lived Malaysian era,  the\r\n\r\ndefence and security of this country was left in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  foreigners  and our one-time  compatriots.\r\n\r\nSince  they were more interested in their own  safety\r\n\r\nand  security  than in this country, they  could  not\r\n\r\ntake  a real interest and attempt to train our youths\r\n\r\nto be good soldiers and defenders of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the break from Malaysia on 9th August, 1965,\r\n\r\nit  has  become incumbent on our people to take  over\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of defence and  security  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  And national service has become a necessity\r\n\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill in full, but I have some\r\n\r\ndoubts  about  certain provisions which  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will clarify for the benefit of the  public.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration sub-clause (1) of clause  5\r\n\r\nand paragraphs (1) (a) and (b) of section 16K of Part\r\n\r\nVIIB, clause 15, the Minister, by notification in the\r\n\r\nGazette,  may require a person who has attained  such\r\n\r\nage  not  being more than 18 months below the minimum\r\n\r\nage  for enrolment in the national service, and  such\r\n\r\ncalled-up  person  will render two  years'  full-time\r\n\r\nservice under subsection (1) of section 16K. Thus the\r\n\r\nMinister may call up a boy at the age of 16\u00ab to enrol\r\n\r\nfor national service and to do actual service between\r\n\r\nthe  ages  of  18  and 20. On the  other  hand,  this\r\n\r\nimplies that a boy in Primary I at the age of  7,  if\r\n\r\nhe  passes the annual examinations without fail  each\r\n\r\nyear,  will  at  the age of 16 or  16\u00ab  still  be  in\r\n\r\nSecondary  IV.  Therefore, in accordance  with  these\r\n\r\nprovisions, while he is still at school, he is liable\r\n\r\nto   be  called  up  for  registration  for  national\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us at one time were school boys\r\n\r\nourselves.  We  know what it was  like  to  pass  the\r\n\r\nschool final examinations.

It is nowhere stated in the amending Bill that\r\n\r\nyouths will be called up for national service at  the\r\n\r\nage of 16\u00bd.

Clause 5 introduces a new paragraph\r\n\r\n(1) (b) which refers to persons who:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"have attained such age not being more than eighteen\r\n\r\nmonths  below  the  minimum  age  for  enlistment  or\r\n\r\nenrolment...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These  persons must register at 16\u00ab but  the  minimum\r\n\r\nage  for  enlistment or enrolment is still 18  years.\r\n\r\nThe 18-month period is the period of processing prior\r\n\r\nto  enlistment or enrolment.

I quote from page 21:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person who has completed his two years' full-time service in the Army need worry about his future,\r\n\r\nfor  sufficient  numbers of  civilian  jobs  will  be\r\n\r\nreserved for discharged National Servicemen either in\r\n\r\nGovernment   service,  Statutory  Boards   or   large\r\n\r\nbusiness enterprises to ensure that every one gets  a\r\n\r\njob.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may be considered as an incentive to our\r\n\r\nyouths or an inducement to the parents to enrol their\r\n\r\nsons  in  army  service.  But  this  will  be  unfair\r\n\r\ntreatment to thousands of other youths who  are  also\r\n\r\neager to seek employment, who are also loyal to  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  and who have equal rights like the  10  per\r\n\r\ncent  elite  to  be  selected for  army  service  and\r\n\r\nguaranteed Government jobs after their discharge from\r\n\r\nnational service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, qualifications for army service may differ\r\n\r\nfrom qualifications for the administrative service.

We live in  an  island\r\n\r\nsurrounded  by  turbulent  seas  of  nationalism  and\r\n\r\nracialism.  The  past few years have shown  that  we,\r\n\r\nhaving  no other place to go to, must and will  stand\r\n\r\nup  and fight if our very existence is threatened  by\r\n\r\nexpansionist ambitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill lays the cornerstone of our national\r\n\r\nresolve  to  be mentally and physically  equipped  to\r\n\r\ndefend ourselves. A side effect of the implementation\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  can be the inculcation of  discipline\r\n\r\namong our population of ages between 18 and 40.  This\r\n\r\nsector  is  the  most physically  productive  of  our\r\n\r\nworking  population  and a more  disciplined  working\r\n\r\nforce  can but do our economy enormous good. However,\r\n\r\nin  the implementation of this Bill, I would urge the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider the following points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine balance will have to be struck between the\r\n\r\ncall of duty and the compensation for those answering\r\n\r\nthe  call.  Ideally,  of  course,  all  should  serve\r\n\r\nwithout recompense, but human beings, being what they\r\n\r\nare, the thin line between enthusiasm and frustration\r\n\r\nmust  be  found  and drawn. I am confident  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Interior and Defence will, in the  course\r\n\r\nof implementing this Bill, find this balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like the Ministry to give serious\r\n\r\nthought  at this stage to the problem and  not  allow\r\n\r\nour national goal to be jeopardised by miserliness. I\r\n\r\nnote that no provision is made for allowances to  the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps. I feel that the Ministry should give\r\n\r\nfurther  thought  to  the  question  of  compensating\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Vigilante Corps for their  time  and\r\n\r\nincidental expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parents of the old school may still feel - although such parents are decreasing year by year - that service in any uniform is reserved for the son\r\n\r\nwho  cannot do better elsewhere.

In this connection,\r\n\r\nmay I quote these stirring words?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n             'Breath's there the man with soul so dead\r\n\r\n             Who never to himself hath said\r\n\r\n             \"This is my country...!\"'\r\n\r\n</pre> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>If  everyone in our country says to himself that this\r\n\r\nis  his  country, his land and his home, and that  he\r\n\r\nwill  fight with his life for what he cherishes, then\r\n\r\nwe shall have a nation and a people who will consider\r\n\r\nit the noblest task to defend his country. May I take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity  to urge every person  eligible  to\r\n\r\nserve  under  this  Bill to do so as  an  opportunity\r\n\r\nrather  than as an onerous task. The glory  to  serve\r\n\r\nshould over-ride any discomfort of services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I heartily welcome and support\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI rise to speak very briefly in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\nMany people may wonder why national service is to  be\r\n\r\nintroduced in Singapore, as Singapore is only a small\r\n\r\nnation in this world. Sir, the answer to this is that\r\n\r\nSingapore is now an independent nation and, like  all\r\n\r\nother   nations,  we  should  have  the   means   and\r\n\r\ncapabilities to protect and defend our nation without\r\n\r\nhaving to depend much on outside help. In fact,  most\r\n\r\nof  the countries have enforced national service. And\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  reason  why  Singapore  should  be  so\r\n\r\nexceptional  in  this  respect.  I  must,  therefore,\r\n\r\npraise our Government for taking such a decisive step\r\n\r\nto  introduce this National Service (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nin order to enlist our 18-year old citizens for a two-year  full-time service in the army or for  part-time\r\n\r\nservices in the P.D.F., the Special Constabulary,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  the Vigilante Corps. This decisive step has  been\r\n\r\ntaken  after  careful thought and consideration  over\r\n\r\nthe last 1\u00bd years, and, in fact, the Government would\r\n\r\nhave  taken  this  step when it  started  to  recruit\r\n\r\nmembers for the People's Defence Force last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as one can remember, when\r\n\r\nthe  National Service Ordinance was first  introduced\r\n\r\nand came into force in 1952 by the then semi-colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment,  many  young  people,  particularly   the\r\n\r\nstudents, fled from Singapore to the country of their\r\n\r\nancestors  in order to avoid being called  up.  These\r\n\r\nstudents did not want to become, in their own  words,\r\n\r\n\"the stooges or ashes of the cannon of the then semi-colonial Government\". There was no support at all  at\r\n\r\nthat  time  from the people, because  they  were  not\r\n\r\nsubjects  of  an independent country but were  people\r\n\r\nliving  in  the  colony  of a  foreign  power.  Since\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  now  an independent country,  national\r\n\r\nservice    has   become   a   community    obligation\r\n\r\ncollectively  and  a  fundamental  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nevery citizen individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of Singapore have learnt a bitter\r\n\r\nlesson   in   the   struggle   for   survival   after\r\n\r\nindependence  and they have now fully understood  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of survival. They have great appreciation for\r\n\r\nour Government for what they have been provided with.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, equal status in the society regardless\r\n\r\nof  whatever race they are; security and freedom  and\r\n\r\nsocial  amenities such as housing, education, welfare\r\n\r\naid and hospital facilities, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the citizens of\r\n\r\nSingapore are prepared and ready to stand up  at  any\r\n\r\ntime  in  response to the call of the  Government  to\r\n\r\ndefend  our  nation  in  case of  emergency.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the  duty of each and  every  citizen  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  all  the privileges of enjoying  the  many\r\n\r\nsocial  amenities  with  which  the  Government   has\r\n\r\nprovided  them. Moreover, national service  gives  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  young people  of  various  races  to\r\n\r\nintermix and mingle with one another through training\r\n\r\nso  that  they may know one another better.  Besides,\r\n\r\nthe training\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteaches  them how to handle arms. Besides this,  they\r\n\r\nwill  also learn to be patriotic to the nation.  What\r\n\r\nis  more important is that these young citizens  will\r\n\r\nbe  taught to understand their social obligations  to\r\n\r\nthe nation and will learn how to cultivate a sense of\r\n\r\nnational consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the opportune time for us\r\n\r\nto  test  whether  our citizens' loyalty  is  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry  of  their birth or to the country  of  their\r\n\r\nancestors. Our Government has already assured us that\r\n\r\nno  person who has completed his two years' full-time\r\n\r\nservice in the army need worry about his future,  for\r\n\r\nthe Government will reserve sufficient jobs either in\r\n\r\nGovernment   service,  statutory  boards   or   large\r\n\r\nenterprises  once  he  is  demobilised  from   active\r\n\r\nservice. If he wishes to further his studies, a place\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  found for him in  an  institution  of\r\n\r\nhigher   education.  We  understand  also  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  about  to  introduce  legislation  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  employment  in  the private  sector  and  to\r\n\r\ncompel  employers  to  take  into  employment   those\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  have served their two years'  military\r\n\r\ntraining.   With  all  these  assurances   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I am sure that not only citizens  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency  will  give  full  support  to  national\r\n\r\nservice,   but   also  all  the   people   in   other\r\n\r\nconstituencies will similarly pledge their support to\r\n\r\nour Government in introducing this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I urge this House to give its\r\n\r\nfullest support to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  if  the people in  our  multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-religious  and multi-cultural society  wish  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  amity  and harmony in an  equal,  just  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society  in this  Republic,  then  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to have national service which, in essence,\r\n\r\nmeans  to  be  prepared  in an emergency.  We  cannot\r\n\r\ndepend  solely on outside forces for our  protection.\r\n\r\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be caught unprepared. We\r\n\r\ncannot   depend  on  aid  solely  on  the  basis   of\r\n\r\nagreements on paper. My reason for saying so is  that\r\n\r\nevery  country attaches the utmost importance to  its\r\n\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,   the   citizens   are   responsible   for\r\n\r\nsafeguarding  the  new  independent  Republic.  Every\r\n\r\ncitizen  I  refer  to,  Mr Speaker,  is  a  citizen,\r\n\r\nwhether he is a Minister, a Member of Parliament, the\r\n\r\nchild  of  a Minister or of a Member of Parliament  -\r\n\r\nthey  cannot be exempted. What is more, the  children\r\n\r\nof  Mr Speaker himself or the people of the Republic\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. In short, from the highest  strata  to\r\n\r\nthe lowest strata; not from the lowest to the highest\r\n\r\nstrata, as has happened in bourgeois countries. For a\r\n\r\nsmall and newly independent Republic such as ours, it\r\n\r\nis  a heavy and important responsibility, because the\r\n\r\ntime  will come when the preparedness of the citizens\r\n\r\nwill depend on our continued prosperity and survival.\r\n\r\nIn  these circumstances, it goes without saying  that\r\n\r\ntraining is vitally important to inculcate the spirit\r\n\r\nof  national consciousness, which is for the  purpose\r\n\r\nof  creating  a new, strong and tugged society  which\r\n\r\nhas its own self-respect. Of course, the training  is\r\n\r\nnot  only in the skill of using weapons but  also  in\r\n\r\nother  modern  technical skills like  transportation,\r\n\r\ncommunications, repairing electrical  equipment  etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is training in good discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every country in this world needs one\r\n\r\nanother.  National service is a social responsibility\r\n\r\nand  the  fundamental duty of every  citizen.  As  we\r\n\r\nprotect ourselves, our families, and our friends from\r\n\r\ndestruction  and loss, likewise we have a  collective\r\n\r\nresponsibility to safeguard and protect our  Republic\r\n\r\nfrom our enemies so that we can forever maintain  our\r\n\r\npeaceful  way of life. In addition, national  service\r\n\r\nwill   also   further  cement  the  close   ties   of\r\n\r\nrelationship between us. It is a real test  of  those\r\n\r\namong   our  citizens  whether  they  have  undivided\r\n\r\nloyalty  and allegiance to the Republic and have  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the Republic at heart.  Those  who  are\r\n\r\nindifferent  to what is happening around  us  do  not\r\n\r\ndeserve  to  enjoy  the  privileges  enjoyed  by  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of the Republic, as mentioned by  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Geylang Serai yesterday in his adjournment\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that there are hon. Members who\r\n\r\nare not aware of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachievements or progress made in the People's Defence\r\n\r\nForce  when  they say we have no songs to  prove  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of  the  P.D.F. We have our  songs.  As  an\r\n\r\nexample, I recite one or two lines which read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`P.D.F. is the People's Defence Force - Serve the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People's Defence Force - excellent service, full of\r\n\r\nspirit, to serve the spirit and soul, prepare to  die\r\n\r\nfor the sake of the country.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The last verse of the People's Defence Force:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore is our mother land, must be protected\r\n\r\ncollectively, and be prepared to destroy our enemies...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  the song of the People's Defence Force.  So\r\n\r\nhon.   Members  must  know  what  progress  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved  by  the People's Defence Force.  Hence  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the National Service (Amendment) Bill\r\n\r\nin order to get a mandate from Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  the National Service Bill,  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  introduced,  is good for a  young  nation  like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  because we have to train our  youths  and\r\n\r\ninculcate  in them a sense of responsibility  towards\r\n\r\nthe  defence of the country. Ours is a small country.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it  has  no  natural  resources  as   other\r\n\r\ncountries  have,  nevertheless  Singapore   has   its\r\n\r\nprosperity and wealth which our citizens can well  be\r\n\r\nproud  of.  Every  citizen  of  Singapore  should  be\r\n\r\nconscious of his responsibility, and not just live as\r\n\r\na   temporary   resident   without   any   sense   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards the nation, as happened during\r\n\r\nthe colonial era. Singapore is now an independent and\r\n\r\nsovereign   State.   Therefore,   the   attitude   of\r\n\r\ntransience must be abolished. Every citizen must give\r\n\r\nhis  undivided loyalty to the country.  The  National\r\n\r\nService (Amendment) Bill is appropriate. It has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced at an opportune time. I am quite sure  the\r\n\r\nyouths  of  Singapore  will be  proud  to  have  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to serve the country. We  must  remember\r\n\r\nthat the gangsters in this country are the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproducts  of  the colonial era, because the  colonial\r\n\r\nadministration  was indifferent towards  our  youths.\r\n\r\nHence   they  became  dead-end  kids  and   took   to\r\n\r\ngangsterism.  Such people will endanger the  country.\r\n\r\nThey are the remnants of colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at Japan, for instance. Her youths have\r\n\r\nbeen  asked to do compulsory national service. So  we\r\n\r\nfind  that every Japanese citizen is full of national\r\n\r\nconsciousness, wherever he may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of responsibility towards the defence of\r\n\r\nthe  country  can  be inculcated  in  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, who should owe undivided allegiance to it,\r\n\r\nthrough  the National Service (Amendment) Bill  which\r\n\r\nis introduced in the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Devan Nair (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  wish  to participate in this debate  on  the\r\n\r\nNational  Service  (Amendment)  Bill.  I  have   many\r\n\r\nreasons  for  expressing my pleasure  in  this  Bill.\r\n\r\nThrough  national service we inculcate pride  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry. We acknowledge our self-respect. If  we  are\r\n\r\nself-centred and do not have regard for the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  nation,  we will never prosper.  But  if  we\r\n\r\nregard our own interests as closely intertwined  with\r\n\r\nthose of the nation, that will also take care of  our\r\n\r\nown  self-interest. But we must have regard  for  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people at large, and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nspirit  we must inculcate in our people. The National\r\n\r\nService (Amendment) Bill, I believe, will be of great\r\n\r\nhelp in developing this spirit. If we help ourselves,\r\n\r\nGod  will  help  us too. But to defend ourselves,  we\r\n\r\nmust  have sufficient training and this Bill  enables\r\n\r\nus to have such training. This Bill is essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people who take up national service will not\r\n\r\nonly  get military training but also training as good\r\n\r\ncitizens, and the sense of social responsibility will\r\n\r\nbe inculcated in them. Parents, particularly mothers,\r\n\r\nmust  encourage their children to join up. I  support\r\n\r\nthis Bill wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, most\r\n\r\nMembers  have  spoken in support  of  this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill.  So  I  do  not want to make a long  speech.  I\r\n\r\nmerely want to comment on certain good intentions and\r\n\r\nobjectives of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be praised that it provides for the\r\n\r\ntraining  of young people, because this  is  the  age\r\n\r\nwhen they attain the peak of their health and this is\r\n\r\nthe  opportune  time  to turn their  aspirations  and\r\n\r\nhabits   into   the   right   direction.   Otherwise,\r\n\r\neverything might be wasted. Therefore, parents should\r\n\r\ngive  their full support to this Bill and  get  their\r\n\r\nyoungsters   to  take  up  national  service.   Every\r\n\r\nindividual should live as a good citizen of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  so  ensure  a good future for him  and  for  the\r\n\r\ncommunity. This is an opportune way to do it, just as\r\n\r\nit  is  done in Western countries. Whether  they  are\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual nations or not, they induce  people  to\r\n\r\ngo  for national service, and we can see the benefits\r\n\r\nthey  achieve  from this. In Eastern countries,  this\r\n\r\ntype  of national service is not very common. Yet  we\r\n\r\nhave  decided to pass this Bill. Therefore,  it  will\r\n\r\nmake us the envy of countries in South-east Asia, and\r\n\r\nthey will also speak encouragingly about us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not intend to use national service to fight\r\n\r\nagainst other countries or to occupy them. We  merely\r\n\r\nwant  to  strengthen our defences  and  the  fighting\r\n\r\npower and the character of our youth. That is why  we\r\n\r\nhave  introduced this Bill and are going to implement\r\n\r\nit. As good citizens of this country, it is necessary\r\n\r\nfor  us to have national service so as to improve our\r\n\r\ndefences  in future. In the First World War,  we  all\r\n\r\nremember  the Japanese invaded Russia. In the  Second\r\n\r\nWorld  War,  the Japanese also had to  fight  against\r\n\r\nother countries. It is because their youths had  been\r\n\r\nproperly  trained through national service that  they\r\n\r\nwere  able  to defeat their enemy. In the  same  way,\r\n\r\nevery citizen of an independent nation should take up\r\n\r\ncompulsory national service training. The  fact  that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill only gives an opportunity for training  to\r\n\r\nthe  18-year  olds draws one comment from  me.  There\r\n\r\nshould also be an opportunity for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigher  age  group to get this training  and  thereby\r\n\r\nattain good health and proper training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support this Bill and I hope the\r\n\r\npeople   will  also  fully  support  the   provisions\r\n\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, since\r\n\r\nSingapore's  independence and  after  its  separation\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia, we have come to realise  that  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent  country  we  cannot  rely  purely   upon\r\n\r\nanother country or countries to protect us in case of\r\n\r\nwar,   invasion   or  other  forms  of  disturbances.\r\n\r\nExperience  has  shown  that it  is  better  that  we\r\n\r\nprotect  ourselves than for us to  be  protected,  to\r\n\r\nsave ourselves rather than to be saved, to fight  and\r\n\r\nstruggle  for our own survival. Since we do not  wish\r\n\r\nto  be  a satellite country or a protectorate of  any\r\n\r\nother country, every Singapore citizen should realise\r\n\r\nthat  to  have full sovereignty, the most fundamental\r\n\r\nthing  is  to know how to govern and how  to  protect\r\n\r\nourselves.  There is a Chinese proverb, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  May I quote it in Chinese first? Yuen sui  chew\r\n\r\npu te chin huo. Translated, it means that if there is\r\n\r\na fire in the neighbourhood, the waters from the land\r\n\r\nfurther away cannot reach and stop the fire in  time.\r\n\r\nFor  example, if there were a fire at Jalan Besar and\r\n\r\nwe  were  to  wait  for the fire brigade  from  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur,  I  am sure the whole of Singapore  would  be\r\n\r\ntotally  engulfed even before it arrived  from  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur. Therefore, we would have to use our own  fire\r\n\r\nbrigade. [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Our\r\n\r\ncountry  is  small,  but our  citizens  are  of  high\r\n\r\nspirit,  progressive, industrious and can  stand  any\r\n\r\nform  of hardships. The introduction of this National\r\n\r\nService  (Amendment) Bill at this  juncture  is  very\r\n\r\ntimely.  This Bill is to show to all nations  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  that we are a determined group, consisting  of\r\n\r\ndifferent races and living under a democratic  system\r\n\r\nof equality and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunity.  Our  country is at present  undergoing  great\r\n\r\nchanges, and organisation is rapidly taking place  in\r\n\r\nvarious  phases. Most important of all,  we  like  to\r\n\r\nshow  other  countries that we are definitely  not  a\r\n\r\nwarlike people or a warlike nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead we are people of a peace-loving nature and\r\n\r\nare  trying  to train ourselves to guard against  any\r\n\r\nenemy.  As  other  hon. Members have already  pointed\r\n\r\nout, the Japanese invasion of Singapore at the end of\r\n\r\n1941  has  taught  us a lesson - a  bitter,  sad  and\r\n\r\nheartbreaking   lesson   indeed,   a   lesson   which\r\n\r\nunfortunately  cost  thousands of  lives.  The  total\r\n\r\nnumber of Japanese soldiers who invaded Singapore was\r\n\r\nonly 100,000, but they swept through the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  countries  in South-east Asia  like  wild  fire;\r\n\r\nwhereas  the  total  number of  British,  Australian,\r\n\r\nCanadian, Indian, Malay and Gurkha soldiers  totalled\r\n\r\nabout  600,000,  which was more than  six  times  the\r\n\r\nstrength of the Japanese invaders. Before the fall of\r\n\r\nSingapore, our so-called protectors had claimed  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  would never perish. On the  contrary,  the\r\n\r\nfact  was  they  retreated and  surrendered,  leaving\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the hands of the Japanese.  The  enemy\r\n\r\nbrutally   slaughtered  thousands  of  our  citizens,\r\n\r\nincluding  infants, and also raped many  women.  Many\r\n\r\npeople  suffered  from  their  tortures.  During  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of the enemy's occupation of Singapore  of  3\r\n\r\nyears  and  8  months, we lived  in  great  fear  and\r\n\r\nhardship, suffering torture and starvation.  We  were\r\n\r\nliving  practically between life and death  and  felt\r\n\r\nmore dead than alive. I am repeating this story in  a\r\n\r\nsomewhat   different  fashion  in  order  to   remind\r\n\r\neveryone  that  from this bitter lesson  we  have  at\r\n\r\nleast  learnt  two things. Firstly, it is  imperative\r\n\r\nthat we must know how to govern ourselves and how  to\r\n\r\nprotect and safeguard ourselves. We cannot rely  upon\r\n\r\nothers,  though sometimes they may have fought  well,\r\n\r\nmaybe for themselves. Secondly, the size of the  army\r\n\r\nis not necessarily the important factor in winning  a\r\n\r\nwar. It is the spirit of fighting, the fighting for a\r\n\r\ncause. Moreover, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nthe well-trained, well-organised and intelligent army\r\n\r\nthat  always  wins. The National Service  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill   not   only  provides  the  necessary  military\r\n\r\ntraining,  such  as  how to use firearms,  etc.,  and\r\n\r\nteach  us  how to defend ourselves, but  it  is  also\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  train and organise our  people  into  a\r\n\r\ntough,  well-trained  and alert  community.  It  also\r\n\r\ngives  our  new  society confidence and self-respect.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  it is educational. It is the  beginning\r\n\r\nof  a  new  era.  It is giving us  a  new  phase  and\r\n\r\neventually  it  will  synchronise  with  our  present\r\n\r\nindustrial  revolution. The essence of  the  Bill  is\r\n\r\nthat  it is well planned and designed. We have  often\r\n\r\nheard  of some so-called brave people saying, \"If  we\r\n\r\nare invaded, we will fight to the last man.\" That  is\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  the Chinese saying,  \"Chiaw  tu  chen\r\n\r\ncher\".  But history and time have shown that fighting\r\n\r\nto  the  last  man or \"Chiaw tu chen  cher\"  may  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily be the best policy when fighting  a  war,\r\n\r\nunless  we have been well organised and well  trained\r\n\r\nbeforehand,   otherwise  we   will   be   sacrificing\r\n\r\nourselves,  and  fighting to the  last  man  will  be\r\n\r\nmeaningless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am all for the National Service (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.  We  are a very young nation and this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nmost essential. I hope that eventually the provisions\r\n\r\nof  this Bill will be extended to cover the older age\r\n\r\ngroups  and those under 18 years of age on a slightly\r\n\r\ndifferent  pattern. We might as well start with  them\r\n\r\nwhen they are young, just like the boy scouts or girl\r\n\r\nguides.  We may call them \"young Guards\". Our  \"young\r\n\r\nGuards\"  will  be  entirely different  from  Hitler's\r\n\r\ntrained youths in Europe when he made use of them  to\r\n\r\ninvade  other countries. Ours will be different  from\r\n\r\nthe  Red Guards. Our youths should be trained in such\r\n\r\na  way that everyone must have a concept of his  duty\r\n\r\nand  responsibility  to  his  country.  He  must   be\r\n\r\nintelligent  and know how to fight for  his  country,\r\n\r\nand  he must always be in a state of preparedness and\r\n\r\nalertness.  The  old Chinese saying that  \"Good  boys\r\n\r\nshould  never  be  soldiers\" is  entirely  wrong.  It\r\n\r\nshould be discarded completely in the 20th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another saying \"i tai Pu lu i tai\" which\r\n\r\nmeans  that  the  next generation is worse  than  the\r\n\r\nprevious one. This is also a fallacy because  in  our\r\n\r\nwell-planned  and  well-trained  society,  the  newer\r\n\r\ngeneration must always be better than the old one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nSir,  I support the National Service (Amendment) Bill\r\n\r\nwhich has been introduced by the Minister of State of\r\n\r\nDefence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As national service is vitally important to an\r\n\r\nindependent  and  sovereign State like  Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nwould remind parents and youths, who are required  to\r\n\r\nundergo  national  service, to be  on  guard  against\r\n\r\nmisleading   propaganda   from   subversive   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  elements  and  others  who  owe  a  divided\r\n\r\nloyalty to the country in their own interest  and  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of foreign countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be proud to accept our responsibilities as\r\n\r\nloyal  citizens in the interest of peace,  prosperity\r\n\r\nand  well-being  of  our  independent  and  sovereign\r\n\r\nSingapore. We should not constantly depend on others.\r\n\r\nThe object of national service is not to invade other\r\n\r\ncountries,  but it is solely for our defence  against\r\n\r\nforeign countries and quell internal disorders caused\r\n\r\nby people who do not owe their loyalty to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support this Bill. As hon. Members\r\n\r\nand  the citizens of Singapore are aware, many things\r\n\r\nhave  taken  place since we achieved independence  -\r\n\r\nracial  disturbances, troubles caused by  undesirable\r\n\r\nelements,  and  so on. For this reason,  I  urge  all\r\n\r\nyouths  to  take  up national service  as  loyal  and\r\n\r\nresponsible  citizens  of independent  and  sovereign\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Sir, if this National\r\n\r\nService (Amendment) Bill were to have been brought up\r\n\r\nin  this  House  some ten years ago,  of  course,  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and I would have condemned  it  bitterly.\r\n\r\nBut  the position now is entirely different from that\r\n\r\nof  the  old  colonial days when we, as nationalists,\r\n\r\nrefused to accept national service under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  colonial regime, because we felt that  under  no\r\n\r\ncircumstances  should we serve any  foreign  colonial\r\n\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today Singapore is an independent Republic\r\n\r\naccepted  by  more  than 110 nations  in  the  United\r\n\r\nNations. Today, we are the sons of the soil  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry;  we  are the masters; we are the  owners  of\r\n\r\nthis  country. All the prosperity and  all  the  good\r\n\r\nthings of life that we enjoy at the moment must never\r\n\r\nbe  given away. If we want to keep all these  things,\r\n\r\nwe must have efficient security measures in the sense\r\n\r\nthat every citizen must be well trained physically in\r\n\r\nthe handling of weapons and must cultivate a sense of\r\n\r\nnational  consciousness, civic-mindedness and  social\r\n\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this amendment Bill is passed, the youths\r\n\r\nwill be brought into the services. They will no doubt\r\n\r\nbe instilled with the spirit of comradeship, loyalty,\r\n\r\ndiscipline and a love of their nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, national service is a patriotic duty. No one\r\n\r\nin  his right mind will be against it except the - if\r\n\r\nI  may be permitted to use this word - \"traitors\"  to\r\n\r\nthe  nation. The Barisan Sosialis and racialists  who\r\n\r\nowe  their  loyalty  to other countries  will  oppose\r\n\r\nnational service. As many of my colleagues have  said\r\n\r\nin  this  House, the Barisan Sosialis will carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  campaign  against this Bill.  Sir,  they  have\r\n\r\nalready  started  to  do this in  its  Chinese  Party\r\n\r\norgan,  the No. 219th issue dated 5th March, 1967.  I\r\n\r\nconsider  this  an  act  of  high  treason  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should take immediate action to smack them\r\n\r\ndown!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment Bill was well received by the\r\n\r\npeople  in its First Reading on the 27th of February,\r\n\r\n1967, because the masses understand the importance of\r\n\r\nhaving our own forces to look after our security  and\r\n\r\nthe well-being of this country. We cannot rely on so-called  help from our neighbour. We can remember  how\r\n\r\nwe  have been taught a severe lesson and given bitter\r\n\r\ntreatment  by  foreign troops during the disturbances\r\n\r\nin 1964. It is still fresh in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nmy  mind  and  in  the minds of  all  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I have grounds to substantiate  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the people are with the P.A.P. Government.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, we launched a campaign for our citizens  to\r\n\r\njoin the People's Defence Force and the response  was\r\n\r\nextremely good. They understand and realise what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  doing  and what they  themselves  are\r\n\r\nserving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is gratifying to know that the Minister has\r\n\r\nrecognised the important part played by the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps in maintaining the peace and well-being of  our\r\n\r\nState,  and  its  inclusion into this  Bill  is  very\r\n\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a little disturbed over the terms of\r\n\r\npunishment in the Bill. To my mind, this Bill  is  of\r\n\r\nparamount importance to the security and survival  of\r\n\r\nthe  Republic  and,  as such, the punishment  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths'  imprisonment and $2,000 fine is too lenient,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  know that we are not dealing with  loyal\r\n\r\ncitizens but with traitors of the State. Sir, when we\r\n\r\ndeal with them, we must deal with them hard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many of my colleagues said in this House\r\n\r\nyesterday and today, we are a very peaceful and happy\r\n\r\npopulation. We do not want to build a big army  which\r\n\r\nmay  disturb  or scare our neighbour.  But  I  cannot\r\n\r\nagree with some of my colleagues who have stated that\r\n\r\nwe  should  have  50 per cent conscription.  I  fully\r\n\r\nagree, however, that we must take joint steps so that\r\n\r\nour neighbour will not be disturbed by our actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not enough for 49 out of the 51 Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House  just simply to pass  this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill, but it is the duty of Members of Parliament and\r\n\r\nleaders  of  communities to drive home to the  people\r\n\r\nthe  importance  and value of the  implementation  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to endorse my wholehearted support of\r\n\r\nthis National Service (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, although the whole world is singing  of\r\n\r\npeace,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of a military power  and  regular\r\n\r\nforces  is  still necessary so that it is  even  more\r\n\r\nimportant  for citizens to undergo military training.\r\n\r\nAs Singapore is an independent sovereign Republic, we\r\n\r\nmust, like most small nations in the world, have some\r\n\r\nform  of military organisation in our midst.  As  our\r\n\r\nisland is of strategic importance in South-east Asia,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  afford  to rely on  our  allies  for  our\r\n\r\nsecurity all the time. The strength of our country is\r\n\r\ninsignificant   when  compared  with   the   military\r\n\r\nstrength of the world powers even if we mobilise  our\r\n\r\nwhole  population. In any case, it is  better  to  be\r\n\r\narmed  than  to be completely unarmed and  be  caught\r\n\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an economic point of view, Mr Speaker, we are\r\n\r\nunable  to  raise  a  very big regular  armed  force.\r\n\r\nNeither have we the military strength to do so.  But,\r\n\r\nstrategically speaking, we must try to  mobilise  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  do part-time or other forms  of  military\r\n\r\ntraining,  and the National Service (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nwill provide this opportunity to do so. We shall then\r\n\r\nseize  the  opportunity to make use of our youths  in\r\n\r\nmilitary  training over a short period and  to  train\r\n\r\nthem  to accept a disciplined way of life. They  will\r\n\r\nbe  trained  in the use of arms and, when  necessary,\r\n\r\nthey will be mobilised and called up for service.  So\r\n\r\nour  youths  owe a duty to society to  join  national\r\n\r\nservice and they will not, by so doing, increase  the\r\n\r\nburden  on the country. On the other hand, they  will\r\n\r\nlend  military  significance to the  defence  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, after some form of military\r\n\r\ntraining,   the  youths  of  our  country   will   be\r\n\r\ndischarged  and revert back to their  jobs  and  take\r\n\r\npart  in  productive activities. After such  military\r\n\r\ntraining,  which is very useful, our youths  will  be\r\n\r\ntrained to become more useful citizens. They will  be\r\n\r\nmore productive because they are disciplined and that\r\n\r\nwill  be of benefit to society. Youths under the  age\r\n\r\nof   21   constitute  a  great  percentage   of   our\r\n\r\npopulation, and they must respond to the call of  the\r\n\r\nnation.  If  we can give proper military training  to\r\n\r\nthem,  then in time of necessity they will be  called\r\n\r\nup into the regular armed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforces  or be placed in reserve, and because  of  the\r\n\r\nspecial  training that they have received, they  will\r\n\r\nalso  be better able to serve society in the economic\r\n\r\nfield  by  raising their productivity. All those  who\r\n\r\nare in the age groups liable to be called up will  be\r\n\r\ngiven ample opportunity to receive military training,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  a  good  chance for them  to  train  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  themselves. They will be able to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  health and become more alert, thereby becoming\r\n\r\nbetter  youths. So national service will be  used  to\r\n\r\ntrain our people, and our youth particularly, into  a\r\n\r\ndisciplined  force.  They will forever  be  ready  to\r\n\r\nrespond to the call of the nation. Furthermore,  they\r\n\r\ncan give even greater impetus to economic development\r\n\r\nand industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Singapore is a multi-racial society.\r\n\r\nIf  we want security, we must be able to see that the\r\n\r\nvarious  races  live in peace. To  maintain  law  and\r\n\r\norder,  we  must  ensure that the  various  races  be\r\n\r\ntolerant  with  one  another and not  interfere  with\r\n\r\ntheir respective ways of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of this Bill, all young\r\n\r\npeople  of  various races and from various  walks  of\r\n\r\nlife  will be receiving similar military training  in\r\n\r\nthe  same surroundings. They will be living the  same\r\n\r\nlife  in  the  army or in the national service  camp.\r\n\r\nThey  will be receiving disciplinary training and  be\r\n\r\ninculcated  with the sense of national  consciousness\r\n\r\nand of social responsibility so that they will become\r\n\r\nbetter  citizens in future. If all our citizens  have\r\n\r\nnational  consciousness and a great sense  of  social\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  then we will be certain  that  there\r\n\r\nwill be no more trouble in a multi-racial society  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  and  the development of our nation  will  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  more  effectively and  efficiently.  We\r\n\r\nshall  be  able to unite and withstand  any  possible\r\n\r\nforeign  aggression instead of having  a  feeling  of\r\n\r\nhelplessness and despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we must not stress too much on the\r\n\r\nmilitary aspects of the training. We must, apart from\r\n\r\nmilitary   training,  pay  some  attention   to   the\r\n\r\ncultivation  of a good physique and good  health  and\r\n\r\nstrong character in our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople, so that they will become a live force in  our\r\n\r\nnation.  It  is  not  necessary  that  we  must  have\r\n\r\nsoldiers in our country. What we want are persons who\r\n\r\nhave national consciousness and some form of military\r\n\r\ntraining and knowledge. The young people must be made\r\n\r\nto  realise  how they can behave properly in  society\r\n\r\nand  to discharge their social obligations and  their\r\n\r\nduties  as  citizens. Therefore, they must always  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for any form of call-up, and they must  all\r\n\r\nstand  on  their own feet and take part  in  economic\r\n\r\nactivities.  In this way, they will  be  able  to  do\r\n\r\nseveral things at the same time. They can help in the\r\n\r\neconomic development and defence of our nation and in\r\n\r\nthe  maintenance of social order as  well.  From  all\r\n\r\naspects, we can see that national service is of great\r\n\r\nbenefit   to  our  society  after  we  have  achieved\r\n\r\nindependence.  I  therefore  support   the   National\r\n\r\nService  (Amendment) Bill and I appeal to all  people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  particularly those  youths  who  fall\r\n\r\nwithin  the age group and who are liable to be called\r\n\r\nup,  to  respond  to the call of the  nation  and  to\r\n\r\nsupport the implementation of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I repeat once more - I support the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  sure  the  question of the  necessity  of  having\r\n\r\nnational  service is on the lips of a lot of  parents\r\n\r\nand  a  source of malicious propaganda by the enemies\r\n\r\nwithin the Republic. We in Singapore are now enjoying\r\n\r\na  period of peace and relative prosperity, and it is\r\n\r\nthe duty of our citizens to see to it that this state\r\n\r\nof  well-being is ensured not only for themselves but\r\n\r\nalso for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must we, as a nation, depend on the protective\r\n\r\nshade  given of by the defensive umbrella of a  major\r\n\r\npower'?  Are  we  going to be militarily  weak  or  a\r\n\r\nsubmissive  nation,  or are we  going  to  build  our\r\n\r\nmuscles? Every citizen must realise by now that Great\r\n\r\nBritain  will not be able to look after our  military\r\n\r\nneeds  forever. The introduction of national  service\r\n\r\nis,  therefore, a very wise and timely  move,  as  it\r\n\r\nwill stimulate our citizens to wake up and value this\r\n\r\nland of ours as their motherland. They should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  proud  that  their  teenage  sons  are  going  to\r\n\r\nspearhead a new generation of Singaporeans  who  will\r\n\r\nknow how to protect and, if necessary, defend what is\r\n\r\nrightly theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not particularly happy to see the\r\n\r\ndivision  of national service into four kinds,  as  I\r\n\r\nfeel   our  young  citizens  should  be  given  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment. They should all undergo the same  form  of\r\n\r\nservice,  namely, military training -  part-time  for\r\n\r\ntwo  years. There is nothing like a spell of military\r\n\r\ntraining  and discipline to build up a new generation\r\n\r\nof  tough, self-respecting and dedicated citizens. By\r\n\r\nputting  all  of  them through  the  same  mill  will\r\n\r\nsubject  all  the  races to the same environment,  so\r\n\r\nthat  there  will  be  a  togetherness  not  only  in\r\n\r\nmilitary training but also in the love of the nation,\r\n\r\na  better understanding of social obligation, and the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of civic-mindedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time and identical military training for the\r\n\r\ndraftees for the first two years will thus allow them\r\n\r\nto  complete their schooling or to go and  find  jobs\r\n\r\nfor  themselves. In this way, the Government will not\r\n\r\nbe  obliged  to guarantee jobs to a small section  of\r\n\r\nour national servicemen. My own feeling is that if we\r\n\r\nare going to introduce national service, we should go\r\n\r\nall out and put every one of our young men through  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of military training. I know we may not  have\r\n\r\nenough facilities at the moment, but we should try to\r\n\r\nrectify this. Military instructors should be employed\r\n\r\nfrom  the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and army camps\r\n\r\nshould  be  constructed to meet the  demands  of  the\r\n\r\nthousands of draftees per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortcut to perfection, and it is by\r\n\r\ntoil,  sweat  and  tears that we can  develop  a  new\r\n\r\ngeneration of loyal citizens, a generation  who  will\r\n\r\ncome  to appreciate what is being done today  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not suggesting that our\r\n\r\nnational  service should stop at a  stage  after  two\r\n\r\nyears  of part-time military training. It should  not\r\n\r\nbe  so.  Once  our young men have undergone  military\r\n\r\ntraining, they should go on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreserve   list  and  carry  on  with  their  national\r\n\r\nservice,  again on a part-time basis, in  either  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Defence Force, the Special Constabulary,  or\r\n\r\nthe Vigilante Corps, until they reach the age of 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, may I make a plea on behalf of\r\n\r\nthe  Vigilante Corps? I feel that the members of this\r\n\r\nCorps should be paid an allowance whenever they go on\r\n\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  ever  since 9th  August,  1965,  when\r\n\r\nSingapore  proclaimed its independence to the  world,\r\n\r\nthe  three  important  problems confronting  it  have\r\n\r\nbeen:  (1)  how to stabilise our political situation;\r\n\r\n(2)  how  to  develop our economy;  and  (3)  how  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  national  defence.  The  first   two\r\n\r\nproblems  have been solved in the short time  of  one\r\n\r\nyear  by the far-sighted leadership of the Government\r\n\r\nand   with  the  backing  of  the  people.

That\r\n\r\nis  why  the  Minister of Defence has to  table  this\r\n\r\nNational   Service  (Amendment)   Bill   which   will\r\n\r\nconsolidate  our  achievements  and  strengthen   our\r\n\r\nnational  defence. Everyone is aware that  externally\r\n\r\nand  internally there are two kinds of people who  do\r\n\r\nnot like to see Singapore succeed. The first class of\r\n\r\npeople are the racial extremists. They do not like to\r\n\r\nsee  the success of a multi-racial society. They like\r\n\r\nto  impose their will upon others. They are  bent  on\r\n\r\ndeceiving the people. The second class of enemies are\r\n\r\nthe  open-front organisations of the Communists. They\r\n\r\nfear  that  our success and happiness will  not  help\r\n\r\nthem   to   incite  the  people  to   overthrow   our\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Because of the existence  of  these  two\r\n\r\nkinds of people, we find it necessary to seek a  more\r\n\r\nstable  political  situation, and  further,  to  seek\r\n\r\ngreater  security for our nation, and  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  nation's defences so that the lives and property\r\n\r\nof our people may be protected and safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore of today is not\r\n\r\nlike what it was when it was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder British colonialism. The Singapore of today  is\r\n\r\na Singapore which belongs to all the people here. The\r\n\r\npeople must not be indifferent, self-centred and self-seeking. They must organise themselves to look  after\r\n\r\ntheir  own  interest. There is a Chinese saying  that\r\n\r\nthe  existence of a nation rests on the shoulders  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. It is the duty of everybody to see  that\r\n\r\nthe nation survives. That is why those people who are\r\n\r\nliable to be called up must take this opportunity  to\r\n\r\ndo  their  part. Under the leadership of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Singapore has won independence  and  has\r\n\r\nenhanced its position internationally. It is  playing\r\n\r\na  more  important  role  in world  politics.  It  is\r\n\r\noccupying a very important and strategic position  in\r\n\r\nSouth-east Asia. In view of this, we must set up  our\r\n\r\nown  defence system. We must not continue to rely  on\r\n\r\nforeign troops to safeguard our country. We must,  as\r\n\r\na  Republic  and as a people, express our loyalty  to\r\n\r\nthe nation and give our lives to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that during the Second World\r\n\r\nWar,  the  Japanese swept into Malaya and there  were\r\n\r\ntwo disturbances in 1964. These disastrous historical\r\n\r\nlessons have taught us that it is not wise to rely on\r\n\r\nother  people's troops. We would be merely humiliated\r\n\r\nand  maltreated by other people. Even our very  lives\r\n\r\nand property will not be safeguarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in this Republic are enjoying security,\r\n\r\nthe  educational facilities, housing and other public\r\n\r\namenities which are being provided by the Government.\r\n\r\nThey  must meet their obligation to protect  whatever\r\n\r\nthey are enjoying at present, and to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nnation  will  not be invaded by others. The  National\r\n\r\nService (Amendment) Bill is only a further measure to\r\n\r\nprepare our young people to be rugged, brave,  imbued\r\n\r\nwith  self-respect,  and well  equipped  with  modern\r\n\r\nweapons  and  dedicated  to  the  protection  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have already said that national\r\n\r\nservice   is  not  a  unique  thing.  Many   advanced\r\n\r\ncountries also have national service. However, I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will take note of one point;  that  is,\r\n\r\nthat those people who are in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossession  of the blue identity cards and  who  fall\r\n\r\nwithin  this  age  group, if they have  acquired  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  qualifications  for  citizenship  and  are\r\n\r\ndesirous of becoming Singapore citizens, should  also\r\n\r\nbe  called  up to take up the national service.  This\r\n\r\nwill show whether they are loyal to our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to express my full-hearted support\r\n\r\nfor this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I would like to air my  views  on  the\r\n\r\nNational Service (Amendment) Bill. This Bill is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  to the defence of our country.  Since  9th\r\n\r\nAugust,  1965,  Singapore  has  been  an  independent\r\n\r\nsovereign country. Soon after that, Singapore  joined\r\n\r\nthe  United  Nations and ranks equally with  all  the\r\n\r\nother  nations  in the world. Only a  minority  group\r\n\r\namongst our people do not recognise the fact  of  our\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Singapore has become an independent\r\n\r\nsovereign  country, and because of  this  status  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore have become the masters of  this\r\n\r\nplace.  They have entered a new phase in the  history\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  To the people of Singapore  who  once\r\n\r\nlived under colonial rule, independence, liberty  and\r\n\r\nsovereignty  are precious. They have to  cherish  and\r\n\r\nprotect them. In order to achieve this, we must first\r\n\r\nprotect  the  lives of the people; secondly,  protect\r\n\r\nthe  integrity of the country; and, thirdly, maintain\r\n\r\nthe  sovereignty of the country. In order to  achieve\r\n\r\nthese  three  objectives, we must  at  least  have  a\r\n\r\nnational force capable of defending ourselves against\r\n\r\nany  foreign invasion or internal subversion. If  our\r\n\r\ndefence  system has to depend on other countries  and\r\n\r\nnot  on our own strength, then the sovereignty of our\r\n\r\ncountry  would,  of  course,  be  in  the  hands   of\r\n\r\nforeigners. We would then enjoy independence in  name\r\n\r\nonly,  and  the  fate  of the country  will  be  very\r\n\r\nprecarious indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, soon after our independence our\r\n\r\ncountry  announced a kind of national service  scheme\r\n\r\nto enable our people to serve voluntarily in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople's  Defence Force. There has been keen response\r\n\r\nto  this  call from people in all walks of  life.  As\r\n\r\ncitizens of the independent Republic of Singapore, we\r\n\r\nhave  the  duty to respond to the call to  serve  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  Our Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries\r\n\r\nand Members of Parliament have set a good example  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  by  joining the volunteer  forces.  Last\r\n\r\nyear,  when our Members of Parliament paraded through\r\n\r\nthe  streets on National Day, they were applauded  by\r\n\r\nthe  people  who  watched the  parade.  This  was  an\r\n\r\nencouraging sight to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Service (Amendment) Bill is in keeping\r\n\r\nwith  the interest of our country, and I am  sure  it\r\n\r\nwill  receive  warm  support  from  all  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. It will afford an opportunity to patriotic\r\n\r\nyouths  to serve the country. They will be inculcated\r\n\r\nwith a sense of discipline, of national consciousness\r\n\r\nand  patriotism. It will also enable  our  people  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  arms in the defence of our country  and  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  strong defence force  to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and train a rugged and closely-knit  society\r\n\r\nwhich will endure forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Defence has announced in this House that soon the Government will enrol youths of a stipulated age group to serve full-time for two years, and also to serve 12 years part-time in the Vigilante Corps, the Police Force and the People's Defence Force. From his statement, we can see that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has also taken into consideration the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  those  who have  been  called  up  for\r\n\r\nservice.  For  instance, to all those who  have  been\r\n\r\naffected  by the call-up, after two years of training\r\n\r\nthe  Government will guarantee that they will be able\r\n\r\nto  return  to  their jobs in Government departments,\r\n\r\nstatutory boards and private firms. Part-time service\r\n\r\nwill  only  be  undertaken in their  spare  time  and\r\n\r\nduring  the  week-ends. The Bill also  provides  that\r\n\r\nemployers  should give every facility to  youths  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  called  up  so  that  they  will  not  be\r\n\r\ninconvenienced. As for those youths studying  abroad,\r\n\r\ntheir  call-up will be deferred. All those called  up\r\n\r\nwill not suffer any disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like the Minister to consider\r\n\r\ncertain  points.  National service should  not  cause\r\n\r\npoor youths, who are good in their studies or who are\r\n\r\nseeking  to  further  their studies,  to  lose  their\r\n\r\nopportunity. At the same time, it should not  provide\r\n\r\nany  opportunity  for  the  rich  to  evade  national\r\n\r\nservice. We know that the Government will select  ten\r\n\r\nper cent - the elite - from the people who are called\r\n\r\nup  to serve in the regular army. This age group will\r\n\r\ncoincide  with the age for schooling and some  youths\r\n\r\nwill  have to depend on scholarships and other  forms\r\n\r\nof  financial  aid in order to carry  on  with  their\r\n\r\nhigher  studies.  If such youths  were  selected  for\r\n\r\nnational  service, they would lose their  opportunity\r\n\r\nand  the means available to them for further studies.\r\n\r\nThus this may lead to a shortage of personnel in some\r\n\r\nfields.  On  the  other  hand,  students  from   rich\r\n\r\nfamilies can afford to and may want to study  abroad.\r\n\r\nThey  may  get deferment in call-up, and  after  some\r\n\r\ntime,  when they have grown up beyond the  age  limit\r\n\r\nstipulated  by  the  law, they will  escape  national\r\n\r\nservice.  So  I  would  like  the  Minister  to   pay\r\n\r\nattention to this and I hope that he will see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat the youths are well advised to register for this\r\n\r\nnational service. I appeal to them to respond to this\r\n\r\ncall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, the National Service  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  has been introduced into this House. This  goes\r\n\r\nto  show that the Government of Singapore is  a  very\r\n\r\nresponsible  and  good one. Under  the  guidance  and\r\n\r\nthrough  the efforts of the Minister of Defence,  the\r\n\r\nBill  has been introduced in time. Generally,  it  is\r\n\r\ntrue  with all countries that irrespective  of  their\r\n\r\ndifferent conditions they have worries of some  sort.\r\n\r\nEspecially  in the middle of the 20th century,  there\r\n\r\nhave   been   great  policy  changes  and   political\r\n\r\nrepercussions throughout the world. If  such  radical\r\n\r\nchanges  in national policy were in the hands  of  an\r\n\r\nirresponsible  government, the people will  lose  the\r\n\r\nsafeguards to their lives and property,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  security  of  the  country  will  also   be\r\n\r\nendangered. Our country will be affected if there are\r\n\r\nany  political  changes  and repercussions  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  Politics is a dynamic phenomenon.  So  if\r\n\r\nanything   were  to  happen,  then  a  peaceful   and\r\n\r\nprosperous country might overnight become a conquered\r\n\r\ncountry  living under the rule of another. This  will\r\n\r\nchill  one's  bones  and it is  really  something  we\r\n\r\nshould watch out against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a newly independent emergent country. We\r\n\r\nhave mobilised all our people and have gone through a\r\n\r\nlong  period  of  struggle  to  achieve  our  present\r\n\r\nindependent  status. The People's  Action  Party  has\r\n\r\nacquired independence for the people of Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  has lived up to the aspirations  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. It has implemented various measures for their\r\n\r\nbenefit,  brought  about freedom  and  equality,  and\r\n\r\nprovided  what the people want. It is the first  time\r\n\r\nin the history of Singapore that the people have such\r\n\r\na  capable, strong and efficient government with such\r\n\r\nverve and spirit and achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may say that in a democratic country,\r\n\r\nthe  demands  of the people are more  than  those  in\r\n\r\nother countries. Therefore, the facilities of such  a\r\n\r\ncountry  must  be more advanced and progressive  than\r\n\r\nthose provided by the other countries. There are many\r\n\r\ncountries  which  call  themselves  democratic,   but\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the emptiness of the leadership  who  is\r\n\r\ndevoid  of  capacity  and efficiency  and  the  right\r\n\r\nattitude,  such  countries, after a long  rule  under\r\n\r\nsuch  leadership, have fallen into  a  mess  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  in dire poverty and struggling  in  deep\r\n\r\nwaters and have become completely disillusioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must give credit to our Minister of Defence who\r\n\r\nhas  drafted  this far-sighted scheme in  time  which\r\n\r\nwill  provide an opportunity for our youth to receive\r\n\r\ntraining and so put our country always in a state  of\r\n\r\npreparedness.  The National Service (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nis  not what the Barisan Sosialis think. It is not  a\r\n\r\nmeans  to make cannon fodder or running dogs  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Our  society  and our  political  entity  is\r\n\r\nformed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  will  and  energy of our people  and  is  an\r\n\r\nexpression  of the idealism and will of  our  people.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen has a say in the administration of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Yet  there are some people  who  disdain\r\n\r\ngovernment  policies and have caused difficulties  to\r\n\r\nthe  society and the Government. But if the  policies\r\n\r\nare  carried out with full conviction and  force  for\r\n\r\nthe  good of the country, the Government will be able\r\n\r\nto  overcome all difficulties. The force of a  united\r\n\r\npeople  is like running water which cannot be stopped\r\n\r\nby the meagre strength of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not treat the people just like\r\n\r\nsheep.  If  it  has  good policies and  an  efficient\r\n\r\nadministration, the people will certainly support  it\r\n\r\nuntil  success  is achieved. We should all  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  the  object  of  the Government's  policies  is\r\n\r\ndirected at the interests and welfare of the  people.\r\n\r\nThe  debate  today on this Bill could  actually  have\r\n\r\nbeen   dispensed  with  as  the  people   have   full\r\n\r\nconfidence  in this government. Why do we now  debate\r\n\r\nit? In actual fact, the Minister could have set up  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  to  implement  it.  But  because  we   arc\r\n\r\ndemocratic, we must go through the democratic process\r\n\r\nin  respect of every policy and measure affecting the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  so we have to spend some time  studying\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is based on the interest of all the\r\n\r\npeople.  There are various opinions existing  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  Some people may think that though  national\r\n\r\nservice  is  very  good,  it  is  better  that  other\r\n\r\nchildren  should be called up and that their children\r\n\r\nmust  be  exempted.  That  is  not  practicable.  The\r\n\r\nproposition advanced by the Barisan Sosialis  is  not\r\n\r\nto  want any national service at all. They incite the\r\n\r\npeople  against it and would rather see  the  country\r\n\r\nsubject  to others. The Government has the means  and\r\n\r\ncapacity  to  take strong measures  to  expose  these\r\n\r\ndestructive elements. In order to practise  democracy\r\n\r\nand efficient government, we should afford the people\r\n\r\nan  opportunity  for discussion. This,  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, will see the government through any crisis.  We\r\n\r\nbelieve we can achieve this in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has also something to do with the other\r\n\r\naspects of our lives and aims, because it will ensure\r\n\r\nthat   the  achievements  in  our  culture,  economy,\r\n\r\neducation,  health and construction can  survive  and\r\n\r\nendure.  We  are  living not only in  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety but also in a society where there is equality\r\n\r\nof  opportunities and services, including equality of\r\n\r\nreligion, economy and education. The people no  doubt\r\n\r\ncan  have  many wants and opinions. For instance,  we\r\n\r\nwant  better  social services, houses, and  a  higher\r\n\r\nlevel  of education. We want to develop industrially;\r\n\r\nwe  want better health amenities and a better  living\r\n\r\nstandard,  etc.  All  this our  Government  has  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to achieve for the people. Together with  the\r\n\r\nconcerted effort of the people, it has been  able  to\r\n\r\novercome difficulties and carry out various plans and\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the daily problem of livelihood, there\r\n\r\nare other problems. For instance, whenever there is a\r\n\r\nfire or a flood in any area, the Government, together\r\n\r\nwith   civic   organisations,  is  able  to   provide\r\n\r\nimmediate relief to the people affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that we have good living conditions. We\r\n\r\nshould  not  allow  our paradise  to  be  invaded  by\r\n\r\nanybody.  We  must also look after the interests  and\r\n\r\nsurvival  of the country and not just after  our  own\r\n\r\nself-interests. We must not feel complacent  for  the\r\n\r\npresent  and ignore to watch out for any  pitfall  in\r\n\r\nthe  future.  The  National Service (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  create  a grand and open path for us  to  tread\r\n\r\nupon, a path which will lead to a better future. This\r\n\r\nBill will better equip the people to face the present\r\n\r\nand the future so that it will bring about a sense of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  survival and  a  new  spirit  to  our\r\n\r\npeople,  and  we can all push out our chests  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  of  the 20th century and  live  and  march\r\n\r\ntowards  a  better future with courage and  hope  and\r\n\r\nconfidence.  The introduction of this  Bill  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture  is  most appropriate. Sir, I  support  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, almost 26 years ago when\r\n\r\nthe   British  capitulated  to  Japanese  troops   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, Singaporeans of our generation learned  of\r\n\r\nwhat  can  happen  to a people in  a  country  caught\r\n\r\nunprepared  and unaware of the external possibilities\r\n\r\nin  politics  and  in war. By an  ironical  twist  of\r\n\r\nhistory,  the people of Singapore were to be reminded\r\n\r\nof  this  same possibility less than three years  ago\r\n\r\nwhen riots took place in Singapore, but this time  an\r\n\r\ninternal problem made possible and caused by external\r\n\r\ncircumstances. In between this period,  we  have  had\r\n\r\narmed   Communist  insurrections,  Communist-inspired\r\n\r\nviolence  and unrest engineered by local  stooges  of\r\n\r\nforeign manipulators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapons of destruction now at the disposal of\r\n\r\nseveral  nations  are  too  terrifying  if  not   too\r\n\r\nadvanced for small nations like ourselves, regardless\r\n\r\nof  whether they are developed or under-developed, to\r\n\r\njoin  the  arms  race. Today, jet fighters  and  jet-fighter bombers are said to be inadequate for the new\r\n\r\nsituation and scope of total war. Singapore alone  in\r\n\r\nany case cannot defend itself from nuclear attack. Be\r\n\r\nthat  as it may, we are living in an era when peoples\r\n\r\nand  States  are faced with newer types of aggression\r\n\r\nand   foreign   intervention.   For   some   nations,\r\n\r\ninternational   subversion   has   today   become   a\r\n\r\nconvenient    substitute   for   outright    external\r\n\r\naggression.  It is in this context that  we  see  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of national service in the  new  setting\r\n\r\nof our independent and sovereign status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However much our adversaries - and here I refer to\r\n\r\nthe Communists and their front organisations like the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  - might attack  national  service,\r\n\r\nthey know that this time we mean to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nbe prepared against any possible emergency they might\r\n\r\nraise.  With  the  passing of  the  National  Service\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill, we are witnessing the opening of  a\r\n\r\nnew  chapter in our history. We are moving into a new\r\n\r\nera  of  new possibilities and we should be alert  to\r\n\r\nthe  new dangers in the region and further afield  in\r\n\r\nthe   world.  There  are,  on  the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\npossibilities of new alignments and new alliances  as\r\n\r\nwe  pursue  our  policy of non-alignment  and  as  we\r\n\r\ncultivate for ourselves the maximum number of friends\r\n\r\nin  peace  and  in  war.  There  is  an  air  of  new\r\n\r\nconsciousness among the people of Singapore. There is\r\n\r\na  new  spirit of multi-racialism which is unique  in\r\n\r\nthis  part of the world. This has been made  possible\r\n\r\nby  our  internal policies which deliberately try  to\r\n\r\nremove  contradictions among the various  linguistic,\r\n\r\ncultural,  religious and racial groups.  Even  today,\r\n\r\nour  armed  forces  have, as its  head,  a  Eurasian.\r\n\r\nBrigadier Campbell is no more Chinese than  I  am  an\r\n\r\nEskimo.  But he is there. That is the new  spirit  we\r\n\r\nhave  started and that is the new spirit  which  will\r\n\r\nradiate  in  the years ahead with our people.  I  can\r\n\r\nmention  many other cases in various other Government\r\n\r\nMinistries and departments where, despite the Chinese\r\n\r\nmajority in our Republic, people have come up on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of merit. But I need not go into this now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service in our Republic will serve as a\r\n\r\ncatalyst  in  building  a nation  out  of  our  young\r\n\r\npeople.  It will teach our people that it is possible\r\n\r\nto  share a common destiny, different and diverse  as\r\n\r\nwe  are  racially  and in other respects.  It  is  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to share common experiences and  thereby\r\n\r\nfoster  the  feeling of living as one people  in  one\r\n\r\nSingapore community. It is an augury for the  greater\r\n\r\nsuccess  of our policy of multi-racialism in a  world\r\n\r\nfilled  with  racial intolerance, racial bigotry  and\r\n\r\nracial discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.36 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

On page 2 of the booklet,  mention\r\n\r\nis  made  about the allowances payable to  those  who\r\n\r\ntake  part  in  parades and it is  also  stated  that\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Vigilante Corps are not paid anything\r\n\r\nfor  taking part in national service. Sir, I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree  on this point. It may be true that members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Vigilante  Corps  have  their  training  in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity of their homes. I think allowances are  paid\r\n\r\nto  national  service  men to cover  not  only  their\r\n\r\ntransport   expenses  but  also  to  meet  incidental\r\n\r\nexpenses such as refreshments and laundry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to request the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  paying  an  allowance  to  members  of  the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps also. The quantum may not necessarily\r\n\r\nbe  equal to that paid to other branches of' national\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  fully  support  the  National Service  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Bill as a whole, every one can\r\n\r\nunderstand that it is meant to defend our territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity  and  sovereignty against any  invasion  or\r\n\r\nsubversion. All independent countries, whether big or\r\n\r\nsmall,  know that the successful defence of a country\r\n\r\nis   the  means  of  preserving  their  independence.\r\n\r\nService  to  the country is not only a glorious  task\r\n\r\nbut  it is also a great contribution by a citizen  to\r\n\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a newly independent country and\r\n\r\nour   citizens   have   a  duty   to   shoulder   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of defence of our country.  Since  the\r\n\r\nhistory of man,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  whatever  situation,  place  and  development  of\r\n\r\nsociety,  the  duty  to  protect  one's  country   is\r\n\r\nabsolute.  This  is true in all cases,  be  it  in  a\r\n\r\ncapitalist   country   or  a   dictatorial   country.\r\n\r\nSingapore has struggled to get rid of colonialism  at\r\n\r\ngreat  sacrifice  and  in the end  we  have  achieved\r\n\r\nindependence. Independence, sovereignty  and  \"master\r\n\r\nof  ourselves\" mean that we have to decide our future\r\n\r\nfor  ourselves.  This also implies that  we  have  to\r\n\r\nmanage our own defence problems. Therefore, following\r\n\r\nthe  independence of Singapore, the defence  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry will naturally fall upon the shoulders of all\r\n\r\nour  citizens.  We cannot deny that  Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country with very limited economic  resources.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is quite a problem to build up a  large\r\n\r\nstanding army in the economic sense. But we  have  to\r\n\r\ntrain  and  prepare our citizens in military  affairs\r\n\r\nand  some  of them in military training so that  they\r\n\r\ncan take up arms in the defence of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the National Service\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill is very necessary  at  the  present\r\n\r\njuncture.   Ever  since  the  last  time   when   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  called  upon  the  people  to  join   the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps, the people have duly  responded  by\r\n\r\nalso joining the People's Defence Force. This goes to\r\n\r\nshow  that they have a clear understanding  of  their\r\n\r\nduty  to  the country. I am confident that they  will\r\n\r\nalso  respond well to this call to serve the  nation.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot depend on those who only want to enjoy the\r\n\r\nbenefits and rights given by the country hut who  are\r\n\r\nnot  willing  to shoulder their responsibilities  and\r\n\r\ncarry   out  their  obligations.  So  this  Bill   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to ensure the survival of our country  and\r\n\r\nit is the duty of every citizen to ensure this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that in the implementation of the call-up,\r\n\r\nwe will pay attention to the fact that it will not be\r\n\r\ncarried   out  to  the  detriment  of  our   economy.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Bill, all youths in the age group of\r\n\r\neighteen will be called up. Some of these youths  are\r\n\r\nat  an  age when they are about to enter Universities\r\n\r\nafter  leaving higher secondary schools. I feel  that\r\n\r\nhigher education is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  to  the youths as well as to the  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we must provide some means  of  resolving\r\n\r\nthe problems of those youths who are attending higher\r\n\r\neducation.   For  instance,  in  the  University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Nanyang University, there are  several\r\n\r\nperiods of long vacation in a year and perhaps we can\r\n\r\nmake use of these periods to call them up for intense\r\n\r\nmilitary  training - say, for a total of  three  or\r\n\r\nfour  months of the vacation periods. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas already allotted four recruiting centres. I think\r\n\r\nthey  are not enough, and I suggest that the  Defence\r\n\r\nMinistry   should  consider  an  increase.   If   the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres in the various constituencies  can\r\n\r\nbe  made  available, it will be most ideal.  It  will\r\n\r\nthen  be  convenient to most of the called-up youths.\r\n\r\nAlso   the  community  leaders  living  around  these\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  can also come  out  to  help  and\r\n\r\nsimplify matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I would like to say something  on  the\r\n\r\nNational Service (Amendment) Bill. I support  it.  We\r\n\r\nknow that it is very meaningful as well as important.\r\n\r\nBut some people do not want to join national service.\r\n\r\nDo  they  still believe in the old saying  that  good\r\n\r\nboys  should not become soldiers? I will  go  a  step\r\n\r\nfurther  and  say  that women  should  also  take  up\r\n\r\nnational  service because they are also part  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation.  They  should  also  shoulder  the   same\r\n\r\nresponsibility as men, to be soldiers and defend  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  We should not forget that this old  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying,  that  good boys should not become  soldiers,\r\n\r\nwas  evolved when soldiers were meant to protect  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the emperors and not the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe   country.  Therefore,  the  people   then   were\r\n\r\nunwilling to become soldiers. That is the reason that\r\n\r\nbrought  about this saying. But now the situation  is\r\n\r\ndifferent. In China today the people glorify the fact\r\n\r\nthat  they can become soldiers. So it seems  that  at\r\n\r\npresent  China  is  a country where  everybody  is  a\r\n\r\nsoldier. In the Middle East countries such as Israel,\r\n\r\nevery man and every woman is a soldier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to lend my support to the National\r\n\r\nService (Amendment) Bill. I stress the point that not\r\n\r\nonly men but also women should join national service.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  with  the intention  to  invade  other\r\n\r\nterritories  or to rob others of their property.  No.\r\n\r\nThis is only in keeping with our national policy.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  have  our  own national  defence  force  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  our  internal  security  and  also  prevent\r\n\r\nforeign  aggression, and we will maintain  a  neutral\r\n\r\nposition  by making as many friends as possible  with\r\n\r\nother   countries.   It  is  very   significant   and\r\n\r\nmeaningful that we have this national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Bukit Timah):</b> (In Mandarin): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  living  in an independent  democratic\r\n\r\ncountry   such   as   ours,  we   know   that   every\r\n\r\nconscientious citizen should love his country. It  is\r\n\r\nespecially true with a country which has achieved its\r\n\r\nindependence at the sacrifice of much blood and sweat\r\n\r\nof its people. Therefore, the people should value the\r\n\r\nfruits  of independence more. On the other  hand,  we\r\n\r\nshould   also  discuss  the  prerequisites   or   the\r\n\r\nattributes   of   a   State.  The  prerequisites   or\r\n\r\nattributes  of  a  State  are  firstly,  the  people,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  territory, and thirdly, sovereignty.  With\r\n\r\nthese three prerequisites a State can he founded; not\r\n\r\notherwise.  These  are the three prerequisites  of  a\r\n\r\nState.  If  we hope to protect them, we as  a  people\r\n\r\nhave  to  form  our political parties  from  which  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  will be formed which will set up  various\r\n\r\ninstitutions  dealing  with administration,  defence,\r\n\r\nforeign  affairs,  finance,  etc.,  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nprotecting  the lives and property of the people,  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  law  and  order,  to  preserve  territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity, and to protect its sovereignty against any\r\n\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this grand ideal in the present\r\n\r\nsituation   which   exists  in   our   country,   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the National Service (Amendment) Bill\r\n\r\nin  this House is most appropriate and timely.  As  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  the people  in  this  society  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, it is my duty,  in  addition\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserving my Party, to serve the country and the people\r\n\r\nloyally. That is my duty. And it is also my  duty  to\r\n\r\nbring the voice of the masses into this House so that\r\n\r\ntheir  desires and ambitions can be heard. This House\r\n\r\nwill  formulate laws to meet the needs of the various\r\n\r\nsections  of the people, especially today when  there\r\n\r\nis   no   Opposition  in  this  House.  This  unusual\r\n\r\nphenomenon - the absence of an Opposition -  has  been\r\n\r\ncreated  by  the  irresponsible Opposition  who  have\r\n\r\nabandoned  their  duty  to the  people.  Under  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, we have an added burden  and  a  moral\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to discharge. Unfortunately,  certain\r\n\r\nsections  of  the  public  have  levelled  criticisms\r\n\r\nagainst  us and not against those Opposition  Members\r\n\r\nwho  have abandoned their duty. This amendment  Bill,\r\n\r\non  the  other hand, will take all manner of pretexts\r\n\r\nout  of  the hands of the Opposition who will try  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  any  opportunity to  carry  out  their\r\n\r\nnefarious designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add some supplementary views. We\r\n\r\nknow  that  in  the history of man  there  have  been\r\n\r\nideas,  slogans or certain fancies which  are  rather\r\n\r\nrich  in  emotional content and which,  if  swallowed\r\n\r\nwholesale,  may cause difficulties and  troubles.  We\r\n\r\nhave  seen certain events in the history of man which\r\n\r\nhave  been  brought about by such  factors.  We  also\r\n\r\nrealise that all men must have worries of some  sort.\r\n\r\nThey  must have some consideration for something they\r\n\r\ndo.  The  time  is  appropriate  for  us  to  prepare\r\n\r\nourselves for a rainy day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of our honest people, I have\r\n\r\nthe  duty  to give a very frank and plain explanation\r\n\r\nto  the  people to enable them to prepare  themselves\r\n\r\nfor the sacred task of national defence. I would like\r\n\r\nto  make  some propositions for the consideration  of\r\n\r\nthis House:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) During the call-up period of registration for\r\n\r\nnational service, there may he some families with two\r\n\r\nor  three  members  who are poor.  In  such  a  case,\r\n\r\nperhaps  we  may  consider relaxing certain  measures\r\n\r\nsuch  as  deferment of call-up. We should  give  more\r\n\r\nsympathetic consideration to such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Students who are attending universities,\r\n\r\ncolleges,  or secondary schools -- we can  give  them\r\n\r\ncertain consideration to enable them to continue with\r\n\r\ntheir studies and defer their call-up until they have\r\n\r\ncompleted  their  studies. In  other  words,  we  may\r\n\r\nperhaps postpone their call-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) I would also appeal to employers to co-operate\r\n\r\nwith  those  youths who are called up and  to  accord\r\n\r\nthem  some facilities and convenience, otherwise such\r\n\r\nyouths  may  meet with certain difficulties.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat employers are judicious and patriotic and may be\r\n\r\nable  to accord these facilities and co-operation.  I\r\n\r\nappeal  to  them  earnestly  to  co-operate  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I express my support for the National\r\n\r\nService (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Minister of Defence may be happy to\r\n\r\nhear   that  there  are  so  many  unanimous   voices\r\n\r\nsupporting  the Bill. It seems that there is  general\r\n\r\nagreement  on this Bill. Everybody agrees  that,  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake  of  national defence, every  conscientious\r\n\r\ncitizen  should  have  the  duty  and  obligation  to\r\n\r\nsupport  this  Bill and take up national  service  to\r\n\r\ndefend his country. As ours is an independent country - for that matter, a very small one - we cannot  rely\r\n\r\non foreign forces to defend ourselves. This task must\r\n\r\ndevolve  on our own people. Dependence on others  for\r\n\r\nour  defence  will  be detrimental  to  our  dignity.\r\n\r\nNational  service will give the youth an  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  serve  the  country. Nobody  can  deny  that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  our people have been staying  here  for\r\n\r\nmany  generations. Many of them have been  born  here\r\n\r\nand  have  been  brought up here, and their  fate  is\r\n\r\ninseparably bound up and intertwined with the fate of\r\n\r\nour country. We have a common destiny. There are some\r\n\r\npeople  who  are citizens of Singapore, their  hearts\r\n\r\nare  not  with  Singapore, and in a  national  crisis\r\n\r\nthese  people  may perhaps want to  escape  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries. If we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  to  rely on foreign forces and these  people  to\r\n\r\ndefend  ourselves,  then it would  be  to  no  avail.\r\n\r\nNational  service will provide military  training  to\r\n\r\nthe  youths  who have been called up, and  will  give\r\n\r\nthem  a  sense  of pride. This military service  will\r\n\r\nalso  make  the  parents  of  such  youths  proud  of\r\n\r\nthemselves and proud of their children, because  they\r\n\r\nhave  the  opportunity  and  the  glorious  task   of\r\n\r\ndefending  the  people and the country.  As  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry,   we   have  no  intention   of   committing\r\n\r\naggression  against any other country. But  when  any\r\n\r\ncountry intends to invade us or threaten us, we  must\r\n\r\nhave  the  means  to  see ourselves  through  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation.  We cannot tolerate others to  invade  us.\r\n\r\nOur people are youthful, with much energy and spirit,\r\n\r\nand  we should not stand any aggression. The national\r\n\r\nservice  we  provide  now is not  the  same  as  that\r\n\r\nprovided during the colonial regime. At that time the\r\n\r\npeople   opposed  national  service  vehemently   and\r\n\r\nbrought  about various riots and violent events,  and\r\n\r\nmany  youths  went  to China and other  countries  to\r\n\r\nescape   serving   their  colonial  masters   through\r\n\r\nnational service. But national service today is meant\r\n\r\nto  provide the means for the people to defend  their\r\n\r\nown  country. Only when a country exists can a family\r\n\r\nexist.  The country must come first. This  should  be\r\n\r\nthe  thinking  of  our people. In  order  to  make  a\r\n\r\ncountry strong, we must make our people strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the passage of this Bill, I would like to\r\n\r\nraise a few suggestions to the Minister in charge  of\r\n\r\nit.  When  some students are attending  colleges  and\r\n\r\nuniversities or secondary schools, it is necessary to\r\n\r\nsee  to  that  their call-up will  not  impede  their\r\n\r\nstudies.  I agree to what the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nhas  said  just now, that we should make use  of  the\r\n\r\nlong   school   vacations  to  give  them   full-time\r\n\r\ntraining.  As for those who join national service  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  accord, the Ministry should recruit  them\r\n\r\nwhole-heartedly without any reservation. I understand\r\n\r\nthat  when  such people wanted to join  the  People's\r\n\r\nDefence  Force or the other services in  response  to\r\n\r\nthe   government's  call,  their  applications   were\r\n\r\nrejected, perhaps for minor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphysical   reasons.  But  this  would   deter   their\r\n\r\nenthusiasm.  They wanted to join these  services  not\r\n\r\nbecause   they  wanted  to  solve  their   employment\r\n\r\nproblem.  They  merely wanted to avail themselves  of\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to serve their country. So I hope the\r\n\r\ndepartments  concerned will recruit as many  of  such\r\n\r\npeople  as possible who have volunteered to join  the\r\n\r\nservices  of  their own accord. Sir, I  support  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. A. Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. A. Gonzales (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, over a year ago, a call was made to our\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  come  forward to  serve  in  the  armed\r\n\r\nforces. The response was better than expected and  we\r\n\r\nnow  have  a volunteer force larger than we ever  had\r\n\r\nbefore  or even dreamed of having. A large number  of\r\n\r\nthe  force is, however, made up of citizens from  the\r\n\r\nlower  income groups who came out of their  own  free\r\n\r\nwill to serve the nation when the call was made,  and\r\n\r\nI take off my hat to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where were the young men from well-to-do families,\r\n\r\nthe young intellectuals and those with long hair-dos?\r\n\r\nThey  were  satisfied with sitting back  and  saying,\r\n\r\n\"Well, there are enough stupid chaps willing to  join\r\n\r\nup.  Why should I?\" They were willing then to let the\r\n\r\nstupid  chaps  do  the fighting should  the  occasion\r\n\r\narise  and  to protect them if trouble arose.  And  I\r\n\r\nthink they still have the same view today as they had\r\n\r\nover a year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service has not come too soon. It is time\r\n\r\nthat  every citizen realized that he has  a  duty  to\r\n\r\nensure  the  security and well-being of his  country.\r\n\r\nOur thinking a year ago and our thinking today is the\r\n\r\nsame.  As  a small nation, we know that it is  beyond\r\n\r\nour   resources  to  have  a  large  standing   army.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown us that it is pointless. What we\r\n\r\nneed  is  a  small  but tough, well  equipped,  well-trained and disciplined force imbued with the  spirit\r\n\r\nthat  this is their country and that they will defend\r\n\r\nit  with  their lives. The plan, therefore,  to  have\r\n\r\nfull-time  military service for  a  small  number  of\r\n\r\npeople is a good one. As in the past, a larger number\r\n\r\nwill be asked to serve on a part-time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbasis in the People's Defence Force, the Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  and the Vigilante Corps.  Let  us  not,\r\n\r\nhowever, get the idea that by serving in the People's\r\n\r\nDefence  Force, we will be serving in a less superior\r\n\r\nunit  than by being a regular or serving as  a  full-time national serviceman. The greatest mistake we can\r\n\r\nmake is to belittle the part that the volunteer plays\r\n\r\nin  the  defence of his country. He is just  as  well\r\n\r\ntrained,  although his period of training is  just  a\r\n\r\nfew  hours  a  week.  It should be appreciated  that,\r\n\r\nafter  a full day's work, he is prepared to sacrifice\r\n\r\na   few  hours  of  leisure  by  going  for  military\r\n\r\ntraining.  It  would appear that in our eagerness  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  national service, we are forgetting  those\r\n\r\nthat are serving as volunteers. For instance, Sir, in\r\n\r\nclause  2  (a) of the Bill, the definition of  \"armed\r\n\r\nforces\" says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'\"armed forces\" means any force constituted under\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Singapore Army Act, 1965,  and\r\n\r\nincludes the Peoples Defence Force constituted  under\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of  the Peoples Defence  Force  Act,\r\n\r\n1965;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This,  I take it, covers those at present serving  as\r\n\r\nvolunteers in the Peoples Defence Force. New  section\r\n\r\n2lA  in clause 20, however, does not appear to  cover\r\n\r\nvolunteers as regards pay or leave, but only those in\r\n\r\nthe  national service reserve. The reason,  I  think,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  the fact that several volunteers have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs for serving their country, and  the  more\r\n\r\nfortunate  are  paid for attending parades.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  the Minister's assurance that this new  section\r\n\r\n2lA  covers the volunteers now serving in the Peoples\r\n\r\nDefence Force. If it does not, all that we are trying\r\n\r\nto  build up will be in vain. Those who have come  of\r\n\r\ntheir own free will to serve the nation are not  even\r\n\r\nprotected by law and they will, therefore, lose faith\r\n\r\nin the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other things which we have to guard\r\n\r\nagainst,  and  that is to consider one  unit  of  the\r\n\r\narmed  forces more superior than another. By this,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  mean  that there should not be a distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  the various services. For example, the  army\r\n\r\nor  the navy. What I mean is that there should not be\r\n\r\na  distinction between a regular soldier, a  national\r\n\r\nserviceman, and a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvolunteer  in regard to the uniform he  wears  and\r\n\r\nthe  accessories. We are endeavouring  to  have  a\r\n\r\nclosely-knit society in Singapore. Let us now take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity, with national service, to build\r\n\r\nup  an  army where every soldier, irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhich  unit he belongs to, can say with pride,  \"I\r\n\r\nam a member of the Singapore Army,\" and not, \"I am\r\n\r\nonly   a   national  serviceman,\"  or  \"I   am   a\r\n\r\nprofessional  soldier.\" Sir, I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  bear this in mind whenever he is advised  to\r\n\r\ncreate a distinction between the various units  in\r\n\r\nthe armed forces. I would, in concluding, say that\r\n\r\nI fully support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  introduction of  the  National  Service\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill is a very serious  matter  which\r\n\r\nwill  affect  the  lives of our  youths  and  will\r\n\r\nchange  the whole character of our people and  our\r\n\r\nRepublic. I support this Bill and I am proud to be\r\n\r\nassociated   with  its  introduction.   No   self-respecting  country  can  depend  or  continue  to\r\n\r\ndepend  on outside forces to protect it.  National\r\n\r\nservice  will provide an opportunity to  integrate\r\n\r\nthe  various races of our citizens into a closely-knit  society. It will bring together  our  youths\r\n\r\nfrom  all  grades. Whether they are rich or  poor,\r\n\r\nwhether they come from wealthy merchants or  shop-keepers,  they will have an equal opportunity  and\r\n\r\nplay their part in the building of our nation. The\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this Bill  is  most  significant\r\n\r\nespecially  at  a  time when the British,  through\r\n\r\ntheir representatives, are urging their Government\r\n\r\nto  consider seriously to reduce or withdraw their\r\n\r\nsecurity commitments in this area and in  the  Far\r\n\r\nEast.  It  is likely that in the near  future  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government will hold discussions with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government   en   the   reduction   or\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of their armed forces. I am  glad  this\r\n\r\nBill,  which  has been introduced, will  give  cur\r\n\r\nMinister of Defence pride in the discussions as we\r\n\r\nwill   not  be  found  wanting  in  the  will   or\r\n\r\ndetermination to organise our people to defend and\r\n\r\nto protect our own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is an honour to take up\r\n\r\nnational service, and to ensure that the scheme is\r\n\r\nsuccessful,    parents    should    give     every\r\n\r\nencouragement  to  their  children  to   take   up\r\n\r\nnational  service. In the implementation  of  this\r\n\r\nBill,  I  would  urge  the  Minister  to  exercise\r\n\r\nextreme  firmness in dealing with those who  evade\r\n\r\nor  attempt to evade national service. But I  also\r\n\r\ndo  hope  that  the  Ministry's  staff  should  be\r\n\r\nconsiderate   and   fair   where   fairness    and\r\n\r\nconsideration are merited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nan  accepted principle throughout the  world  that\r\n\r\nthe  privilege of citizenship carries with it  the\r\n\r\nliability to engage in military training  for  the\r\n\r\ndefence  of  the  country. It is clear  that  this\r\n\r\nprinciple  does  not  need  any  elaboration.  But\r\n\r\nbefore  I  go  further, I would  like  to  make  a\r\n\r\npassing  reference to the very few of  our  people\r\n\r\nwho  consider that we are not, in fact, a free and\r\n\r\nindependent country. Logically, these  people,  if\r\n\r\nthey  possess pink identity cards, should exchange\r\n\r\nthem  for blue ones. For then they would  have  at\r\n\r\nleast  a  little  ground  to  object  to  military\r\n\r\ntraining  in defence of the country.  In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nshould say they would then have no right at all to\r\n\r\nraise their voices for they are not citizens.  But\r\n\r\nfor  those of our citizens, our able-bodied  young\r\n\r\nmen,   they  will  have  to  have  the  sense   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility    to   defend    the    democratic\r\n\r\ninstitutions  upon  which  the  liberties  of  our\r\n\r\npeople depend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question may be asked, how far are we\r\n\r\njustified  in calling upon the individual  citizen\r\n\r\nto  make  a personal sacrifice for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe  State? Can we admit in any circumstances that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be compulsory national  service?  I\r\n\r\nwill  just quote a couple of examples in reply  to\r\n\r\nthem. We all do accept compulsion in taxation, for\r\n\r\nwe  look upon it as necessary and inevitable if  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  were  to  carry  on  its  business  of\r\n\r\ngoverning  the  country. Again, we accept  without\r\n\r\nany question the principle of compulsory insurance\r\n\r\nof motor vehicles for very obvious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasons. So, when it comes to the question of  the\r\n\r\nState's actual security and existence, no  one  in\r\n\r\nhis  right  mind should question the necessity  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory national service. It has been said that\r\n\r\n\"Civilisation is in itself an admission  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the individual must be subordinate to\r\n\r\n`those  of  the community.\" We cannot wait  for  a\r\n\r\nnational  disaster to occur before compelling  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  take  their share  in  the  duty  of\r\n\r\ndefence.  If  it were so, then it  would  be  like\r\n\r\ntrying to organise a fire brigade after a fire had\r\n\r\nactually  started. We cannot leave  democracy  and\r\n\r\nprogress   at   the  mercy  of  indifference   and\r\n\r\nirresponsibility.  We must  realise  that  in  the\r\n\r\nmodern  world, even the best of social  conditions\r\n\r\ncan  easily  be upset in a day or two  unless  the\r\n\r\ncountry  in  which they exist is  able  to  defend\r\n\r\nitself.  Those of you who have studied the history\r\n\r\nof  South  America know that in ancient  Peru  the\r\n\r\npeonle  had  realised the condition of  socialism.\r\n\r\nBut  we know how easily a few armed invaders under\r\n\r\nthe  Spanish  conquerors over-ran the country  and\r\n\r\nover-threw their socialism at a touch.  Mind  you,\r\n\r\nthe  Peruvians  outnumbered the  Spaniards  by  at\r\n\r\nleast  a  thousand to one, but the Spaniards  were\r\n\r\narmed  and  know how to use their arms, while  the\r\n\r\nPeruvians had no arms to speak about, or  at  best\r\n\r\nthey  merely had an army in name. The fate of  the\r\n\r\nPeruvians  suffices to show that  even  a  perfect\r\n\r\nsocial  and  industrial system, if not efficiently\r\n\r\norganised and defended, may go down easily  before\r\n\r\nan armed and trained invader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, I can just imagine that a very small\r\n\r\nminority  of  our people will make a hue  and  cry\r\n\r\nagainst  national  service,  saying  that  it   is\r\n\r\nundemocratic.  Let me ask them, is there  anything\r\n\r\nundemocratic  in the proposal that every  citizen,\r\n\r\nto  whatever class of the community he may belong,\r\n\r\nand  irrespective of race, should  have  the  same\r\n\r\nliability to serve the State under exactly similar\r\n\r\nconditions? In fact, I would say that this is  the\r\n\r\nvery  essence of true democracy. Every young able-bodied man should be proud to take his place as  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  thousands of fellow  citizens  in\r\n\r\ndefence of his country and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbear  his  share  of the country's  burdens.  This\r\n\r\nproposition will certainly meet with the  absolute\r\n\r\napproval  and  wholehearted support of  all  loyal\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practical side of national service, that is,\r\n\r\nthe  drill  parades, the training in  the  various\r\n\r\naspects  of  self-defence and discipline,  are  in\r\n\r\nthemselves  good  for  the character  building  of\r\n\r\nevery individual. This is only by the way, for the\r\n\r\ncardinal principle in national service is that  it\r\n\r\nis the duty of every citizen to submit to whatever\r\n\r\nsacrifice (if you can call it `sacrifice') he  may\r\n\r\nbe  called upon to make. As a matter of fact,  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the Bill, the so-called  sacrifice\r\n\r\nwhich  the individual citizens are asked to  make,\r\n\r\nare  little  enough  compared with  those  of  the\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries of the world. I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nyoung able-bodied citizens of our country will not\r\n\r\nconsider it a sacrifice when they are called  upon\r\n\r\nto  serve the country under the provisions of this\r\n\r\nBill.  The  very  great  majority  of  them   will\r\n\r\ncertainly accept their responsibility and consider\r\n\r\nit  a  privilege to be able to take an  honourable\r\n\r\npart in the defence of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old out-dated idea that we are sojourners in\r\n\r\nthe  land  of our adoption can no longer  prevail.\r\n\r\nFor  if  we  consider our welfare and  prosperity,\r\n\r\nindeed  our  very  existence,  and  if  we  are  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  and  thoughtful  people,  it  must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  an obligation and indeed  a  privilege\r\n\r\nfor  everyone who is able to learn to  defend  the\r\n\r\ncountry  in  case  of  a national  emergency.  The\r\n\r\nsolution,  for  the  continued  existence  of  our\r\n\r\ndemocratic  institutions, indeed our very  freedom\r\n\r\nand  liberty, rests in armed strength and  not  in\r\n\r\nunarmed weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  may I, first of  all,  express  my\r\n\r\nthanks  and appreciation to Members of  the  House\r\n\r\nwho  have made so many useful contributions in the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  this debate. I think I am  in  general\r\n\r\nagreement  with them as regards the necessity  for\r\n\r\ntaking  the measures that we have to. Some Members\r\n\r\nhave raised a number of points and have brought to\r\n\r\nmy  attention some problems which they think might\r\n\r\narise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the course of the implementation of the Ordinance,\r\n\r\nand these points deserve comment from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Member for Telok Blangah has asked\r\n\r\nwhether, if in future persons in military service are\r\n\r\nvictimised  in some way or other because they  cannot\r\n\r\ndo  overtime  as a result of military training,  some\r\n\r\nsafeguards   cannot  be  found   to   protect   their\r\n\r\ninterests.  The answer is, of course, in  two  years'\r\n\r\ntime  when these national servicemen, i.e, the  full-time  soldiers, go into the reserve and get  employed\r\n\r\nunder  this Scheme of Direction of Employment,  there\r\n\r\nwill   be   no   inducement  for  the   employer   to\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  against the reservists, because  if  he\r\n\r\ndoes so and the reservist leaves his employment, what\r\n\r\nhe will get as replacement is another reservist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has brought up a theme\r\n\r\nvery  close  to  my  heart, that is  the  singing  of\r\n\r\nmilitary songs by our soldiers. In fact, some  months\r\n\r\nago,  I asked the professional officers to produce  a\r\n\r\nsong-book,  but  because they  were  trained  in  the\r\n\r\nBritish  tradition, they could not see  why  an  army\r\n\r\nshould  have  a song-book. However, the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture is producing  a\r\n\r\nsong-book  for the Vigilante Corps. There  are  about\r\n\r\n100  songs  one third in the national language,  one-third  in  Chinese and one-third in English.  So  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps will have a song-book  before  long,\r\n\r\nand  I  think, when the soldiers see that, they  will\r\n\r\ninsist  that  their professional officers  produce  a\r\n\r\nsong-book which will be as inspiring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah objects to the practice\r\n\r\nof  blowing  a  trumpet In the Infantry Regiments  to\r\n\r\nannounce  meal-times. I myself  cannot  see  anything\r\n\r\nwrong with it. If you do not have a trumpet, then you\r\n\r\nmust have gongs or sirens or you let off fireworks. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  what the point is, whether  meal-times\r\n\r\nshould  not be announced or should be announced  with\r\n\r\nthe use of some other instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

First, with regard to clause 5,  he\r\n\r\nasks,  \"Why should the Minister and not the President\r\n\r\nissue  the notice in the Gazette requiring people  to\r\n\r\nregister?\"   This,   of   course,   is   a    routine\r\n\r\nadministrative  matter  and  it  is  not  the   usual\r\n\r\npractice  to saddle the President with administrative\r\n\r\nmeasures  of  this kind. He asks, \"Why not  bring  in\r\n\r\nyouths  from  the ages of 18 to 25 into the  national\r\n\r\nservice?\" And in this, he is supported by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson. The answer is that the exercise  will  be\r\n\r\nbogged  down by the sheer numbers involved.  In  each\r\n\r\nage  group, you roughly have anything between  19,000\r\n\r\nand  25,000, and if you extend it to say eight years,\r\n\r\nyou  may  have  to deal with something  like  120,000\r\n\r\npersons.  We have neither the staffing, training  nor\r\n\r\nphysical  resources to cater for national service  on\r\n\r\nthat scale, nor is it necessary really to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of allowances for the Vigilante Corps\r\n\r\nis  supported  by the Members for Punggol,  Havelock,\r\n\r\nJoo Chiat and Aljunied I am still of the opinion that\r\n\r\nservice  in the Vigilante Corps is voluntary  and  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  made  voluntary.  I  will  try  to   make\r\n\r\narrangements for free bus travel for those  who  have\r\n\r\nto attend training classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has some curious notions\r\n\r\nabout  what sort of people would be required to  join\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfull-time  army.  He  thinks  it  will  be  the  less\r\n\r\nintelligent  and  not the more  brainy  type.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure him that those joining the army will not  only\r\n\r\nhave  muscles but will also have brains. So  I  think\r\n\r\nthe fear that he has expressed that the personnel  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service will be less and less intelligent\r\n\r\nis groundless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat has put forward a novel\r\n\r\nproposition that, instead of asking the youths to  do\r\n\r\nfour  different kinds of service, they should all  do\r\n\r\nthe  same  service  for two years and  all  part-time\r\n\r\nservice.  This is not practical, because  if  you  do\r\n\r\nthis, then you will not have an army because an  army\r\n\r\nmust  be  manned by full-time personnel. One  way  of\r\n\r\ngetting  everybody to do the same thing would  be  to\r\n\r\nget  everybody to do full-time military training  for\r\n\r\ntwo  years, as it is being done in several  countries\r\n\r\nlike  Switzerland, Sweden, Israel and others. But  we\r\n\r\nhave  worked out the cost of this exercise and it  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that the Republic just cannot  afford.  In\r\n\r\nten years' time, this kind of thing is guaranteed  to\r\n\r\nmake us completely bankrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has made a very useful\r\n\r\nsuggestion and that is that if in future non-citizens\r\n\r\napply for citizenship, they should be required to  do\r\n\r\nmilitary  service. I think this is  a  very  valuable\r\n\r\nsuggestion which the Government will bear in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development is doubtful whether four registration centres would be enough and he thinks that all community centres should be mobilised into service. The point is that during the 16 days in which young men will be registered, there will be\r\n\r\nonly 600 a day, and to deal with such a number a day,\r\n\r\nfour   registration  centres  would   be   sufficient\r\n\r\nprovided  that  boys of 18 turn up on  the  scheduled\r\n\r\ndates.  If,  of  course, they  all  turn  up  on  one\r\n\r\nparticular  day,  then the whole  exercise  would  be\r\n\r\nbusted. That can happen whether you have four centres\r\n\r\nor more than four centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru suggests that women\r\n\r\nshould  participate in national service. I  must  ask\r\n\r\nhim to remember that the national service we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  here  is compulsory and not voluntary.  Anybody\r\n\r\nwho  is asked to join the full-time army and does not\r\n\r\ndo  so  goes  to  gaol, and I do not  think  we  have\r\n\r\nreached  the stage where we will tell women,  \"Unless\r\n\r\nyou  do  this, that or the other, you will spend  six\r\n\r\nmonths  in  gaol.\" [Laughter] This is not a  laughing\r\n\r\nmatter at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah makes a plea for\r\n\r\nfamilies who may have two or three members called up.\r\n\r\nI  do  not see how this can happen unless, of course,\r\n\r\nthey  are  twins  and  the  particular  parents   are\r\n\r\nunusually  prolific. Of course, in  the  law  itself,\r\n\r\nthere  is  allowance  to  exempt  or  defer  national\r\n\r\nservice on the ground of hardship where hardship  can\r\n\r\nbe proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah and the Member for Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan make a plea on behalf of students who are  now\r\n\r\nstudying  in universities and ask that their  service\r\n\r\nbe deferred. I will lay them a bet of 100 to one that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  student in Nanyang University  or  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore who is liable  to  national\r\n\r\nservice because this concerns only people aged 18 and\r\n\r\nthose  in the universities are at least 19, 20  years\r\n\r\nold or more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan wants to retain voluntary\r\n\r\nparticipation in the Vigilante Corps and the People's\r\n\r\nDefence  Force, and I think he has a valid point.  We\r\n\r\nwill,  of course, try to take in people of other  age\r\n\r\ngroups who want to join up. But in the first phase of\r\n\r\nnational  service,  I think the whole  administration\r\n\r\nwill  be  very hard put to it just to cope  with  the\r\n\r\n18,000  or  so  who  will have to do  their  national\r\n\r\nservice  this year. So when the machinery has settled\r\n\r\ndown   and   we  have  more  resources  by   way   of\r\n\r\ninstructors,  barracks and classrooms, we  will  bear\r\n\r\nhis suggestion in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens expresses the hope\r\n\r\nthat  we will not forget the P.D.F. - those who  have\r\n\r\nvolunteered so magnificently in the last year  and  a\r\n\r\nhalf and at some sacrifice. I assure him that we have\r\n\r\nthe  highest  esteem  for these volunteers  and  that\r\n\r\ntheir  interest  will  be  protected  in  every   way\r\n\r\npossible. As regards uniforms, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabsolutely accept his proposal that uniforms should\r\n\r\nbe the same for all units, with, of course,\r\n\r\ndifferences in formation signs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also asks whether\r\n\r\nsection  21A  covers the present P.D.F.  Section  21A\r\n\r\ndoes  not  cover the present P.D.F. -  that  is,  the\r\n\r\nobligation of the employer to grant leave to those on\r\n\r\nthe  national  reserve to enable  them  to  do  their\r\n\r\nannual  training.  So  the answer  is  `No'.  But  my\r\n\r\nMinistry'  is  thinking of amending the Ordinance  to\r\n\r\ngive  members of the P.D.F. - that is, the  volunteer\r\n\r\nmembers - the same kind of cover and protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for River Valley has asked me\r\n\r\nto deal firmly with evasion. I can give him an\r\n\r\nassurance that this is very much in my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 22, to leave out the bracket, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 23, to leave out the bracket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are drafting amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

During the week-end, considerable time is wasted in travelling to and\r\n\r\nfrom   camping   sites   and  training   areas,   and\r\n\r\ncomparatively   little  time  is  spent   on   actual\r\n\r\ntraining.  A  continuous period of  in-camp  training\r\n\r\nduring the first six months would, therefore, he much\r\n\r\nmore  effective from the training point of  view  and\r\n\r\nwould  also  enable recruits to gain an insight  into\r\n\r\ncamp life at an early stage of their training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is considered necessary\r\n\r\nbecause of the first amendment, and the third\r\n\r\namendment is merely a matter of drafting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15, as amended, ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 16 to 19 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn page 11, line 18, to leave out \"trading\" and\r\n\r\ninsert \"training\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is purely a typographical amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20, as amended, ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That clause 21 stand part of the Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my attention\r\n\r\nhas  been drawn to paragraph (g) of clause 21,  which\r\n\r\nis  to  allow for the serving of notice to  a  person\r\n\r\ndisplaying the notice \"at some public place\".

In the  rural  areas,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, there is a large number of attap huts whose\r\n\r\nnumbers  are  either  unofficial  or,  if  they   are\r\n\r\nofficial,  they do not run serially. There have  been\r\n\r\ncases where the same set of numbers appear along  the\r\n\r\nsame  road  at  different places.  In  the  slums  of\r\n\r\nChinatown,  many families may share the same  address\r\n\r\nand  when  the  postman delivers  a  letter  to  this\r\n\r\naddress, it is by no means certain that the addressee\r\n\r\nwill get the letter or the notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In serving a notice to national servicemen or\r\n\r\npersons  liable  to national service,  every  attempt\r\n\r\nwill be made to reach them personally, either by post\r\n\r\nor  by  personal messenger.

I  will  merely  touch  upon  several\r\n\r\nimportant points in the recommendations, namely,  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of the Council of State, the  Ombudsman,\r\n\r\nand provisions to be entrenched in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Constitutional Commission, after\r\n\r\nconsidering all factors, have suggested for inclusion\r\n\r\nin  the Constitution provisions for the setting up of\r\n\r\nan   advisory  body  called  the  Council  of   State\r\n\r\ncomprising 21 members to guard against the passage of\r\n\r\nany    discriminatory   legislation   affecting   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  any minorities with  a  view  also  to\r\n\r\nensuring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nthat, in the present situation where the House has no\r\n\r\neffective  Opposition,  the  Council  of  State   can\r\n\r\nprovide some supervision over Government legislation.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, this Council of State may be able to\r\n\r\nexercise  the duties that an Opposition Party  should\r\n\r\nexercise  in this House. This Council of  State  lies\r\n\r\nsomewhere  between Parliament and an Upper House.  In\r\n\r\nour  country, this institution will be something like\r\n\r\nthe  House of Lords of the British Parliament. As far\r\n\r\nas  I  understand, the British House of  Lords  is  a\r\n\r\ncharacteristic monarchic institution in  that  it  is\r\n\r\nmerely  an  aristocratic Council for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nemplacing people who have contributed to that country\r\n\r\nand  providing  them with a means  of  livelihood  in\r\n\r\ntheir  old age. The House of Lords actually  has  not\r\n\r\nmuch  power  or effect over the passing of  laws.  So\r\n\r\nthere has been controversy over the need of the House\r\n\r\nof  Lords.  Some people have proposed its  abolition,\r\n\r\nbut without avail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the present situation obtaining in our country\r\n\r\nis  different.  Because of the  inefficiency  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and  their  boycott  of  this  House,   a\r\n\r\nsituation is created where we should have somebody to\r\n\r\ntake  their part, hence the Council of State.  As  to\r\n\r\nthe  merits and demerits of this Council of State,  I\r\n\r\nwill touch on several points. We find that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The composition of this Council of State,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the Report, should be of citizens  who\r\n\r\nhave   contributed  to  public  service,   and   have\r\n\r\ndistinguished themselves in their own walks of  life.\r\n\r\nWe  have  general agreement on this point. Inevitably\r\n\r\nthere  can  be diverse views in the Council,  and  if\r\n\r\ntheir  views differ from the views of the people,  we\r\n\r\ndoubt  whether the views held by the members  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  can  be representative of the views  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The number of members in the Council is 21.\r\n\r\nWith  such a large number of members, it will be very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  arrive at unanimous agreement  in  any\r\n\r\nmatter. I feel that if such a situation happens, then\r\n\r\nthis   House  will  be  faced  with  various  diverse\r\n\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Government will incur additional\r\n\r\nexpenditure by setting up this Council. For instance,\r\n\r\nif every Councillor were to draw $500 allowance every\r\n\r\nmonth,  the Government would have to spend more  than\r\n\r\n$100,000  every year. Whether this is  worthwhile  or\r\n\r\nproper will have to be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Constitutional Commission, in considering\r\n\r\nthe setting up of this Council, took into account the\r\n\r\npresent  situation  in the House where  there  is  no\r\n\r\nOpposition.  When  there is  an  Opposition  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, what would be the position of this Council  of\r\n\r\nState?  This  might be an interim measure recommended\r\n\r\nby  the  Commission.  But nobody can  guarantee  that\r\n\r\nthere  will never be an Opposition in this House.  So\r\n\r\nwe  should consider this point and see whether it  is\r\n\r\nappropriate to have such an institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would touch upon is the system of\r\n\r\nOmbudsman.  The tasks of this Ombudsman are,  namely,\r\n\r\nto    supervise   the   administration   of   various\r\n\r\nadministrative institutions and deal with  complaints\r\n\r\nagainst  them. In principle, this system is  laudable\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Ombudsman  can  supervise  the  various\r\n\r\nadministrative  organs and make them  more  effective\r\n\r\nand efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system has been in practice in Sweden for more\r\n\r\nthan  100 years. In the British Commonwealth, Britain\r\n\r\nhas  only  recently considered the adoption  of  this\r\n\r\nsystem.  In 1962 New Zealand made use of this system.\r\n\r\nSo  far this system is still in an experimental stage\r\n\r\nthere and the result is still not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain adopted this system by an Act in 1966. But\r\n\r\nso  far it has still not put it into practice.  Other\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  countries  like  Australia,  India  and\r\n\r\nCanada, whose history of independence has been longer\r\n\r\nthan  ours,  have not adopted this system.  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas been independent for not more than two years.  It\r\n\r\nwould be appropriate if we were to describe it  as  a\r\n\r\nbaby. For a baby to learn every act of a grown-up  is\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nlogical.  Therefore, the Government can  only  accept\r\n\r\nthis  suggestion in principle. This  is  the  correct\r\n\r\nattitude. Let us look at the results of the countries\r\n\r\nwhich  are implementing this system before we  decide\r\n\r\nto  adopt it. Let us see during the next five or  ten\r\n\r\nyears what contribution this system can make in other\r\n\r\ncountries. If it is practicable, then we can consider\r\n\r\nwhether  the  same  results can be  achieved  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  This  is  another  point  that  merits  our\r\n\r\nconsideration,  not to say that our  environment  and\r\n\r\nour  situation  and  position are entirely  different\r\n\r\nfrom   those  obtaining  in  New  Zealand  and  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though at present we do not have the Ombudsman, yet\r\n\r\nwe  have  the Central Complaints Bureau.  People  can\r\n\r\nlodge  their  complaints about administrative  faults\r\n\r\nwith  this Central Complaints Bureau with a  view  to\r\n\r\nredressing  their grievances, if they could  not  get\r\n\r\ntheir  remedy  at  the courts. This Bureau  would  be\r\n\r\nsomething  like  an Ombudsman. The  Director  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Complaints Bureau has powers and  facilities\r\n\r\nsimilar  to those provided for the Ombudsman,  except\r\n\r\nthe  power  to call for evidence and witnesses.  When\r\n\r\nnecessary,  he can suggest to the Prime  Minister  to\r\n\r\nadopt certain measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fifth chapter of the Report, three methods\r\n\r\nare  suggested  in  relation to the  entrenchment  of\r\n\r\ncertain  provisions in the Constitution.  Firstly,  a\r\n\r\nBill  altering the Constitution should not be  passed\r\n\r\nunless  it  is expressly stated therein  that  it  is\r\n\r\nintroduced  with  a  view to making  such  amendments\r\n\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill amending the Constitution\r\n\r\nshould, in the final voting, have received at least a\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds   majority  of  the  elected  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament before it can be passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, any provisions amending the Constitution\r\n\r\nshould  be presented and approved by the majority  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  qualified to vote, both  inside  and\r\n\r\noutside  the  House. The Government has  adopted  the\r\n\r\nsecond  method, which is the most appropriate in  our\r\n\r\npresent situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the present Government\r\n\r\nshould  be  commended for its efforts  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living  of  our  multi-racial,   multi-cultural and multi-religious people and to give  more\r\n\r\nprosperity   and   happiness,  be  they   in   social\r\n\r\nactivities  or development projects. We can  see  for\r\n\r\nourselves that many schools have been built to  cater\r\n\r\nfor  the  increasing number of the country's  school-going children; factories have been set up to provide\r\n\r\nmore  employment  to  our  school-leavers;  old   and\r\n\r\ndilapidated  houses have given way to  modern  multi-storey  flats in order to solve the housing  problems\r\n\r\nfaced  by  our people. At the same time, drains  have\r\n\r\nbeen  constructed, whilst the smaller ones have  been\r\n\r\nwidened  to  alleviate flooding and prevent  stagnant\r\n\r\nwaters  from  becoming places for mosquito  breeding.\r\n\r\nMany  new roads have been constructed and small  ones\r\n\r\nwidened  to cope with the increased volume of traffic\r\n\r\nin our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects carried out by Government in urban\r\n\r\nareas  so  far have been successful and  are  gaining\r\n\r\nmomentum. Every State guest from abroad and  tourists\r\n\r\nalike who call at Singapore are truely amazed by  the\r\n\r\nvarious Government projects. It is even more  so  for\r\n\r\nthose who have been here previously so that they  can\r\n\r\ncompare the state of affairs obtaining then and  now.\r\n\r\nBut Government projects in Kampong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKembangan Constituency, which is a suburban area,  is\r\n\r\na  matter of regret to me. I have stated earlier that\r\n\r\nGovernment's effort to uplift the living standards of\r\n\r\nthe  people  is praiseworthy, regardless  of  whether\r\n\r\nthey  live in the urban or rural areas, so  that  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of living of the people in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nwill  be at par with that of the people in the  city.\r\n\r\nOn  the contrary, the livelihood of the people in the\r\n\r\nkampongs,   specially  those  in  Kampong  Kembangan,\r\n\r\nleaves much to be desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Kembangan Constituency is a low-lying area\r\n\r\nand is easily flooded when it rains. There is no need\r\n\r\nto  wait  for the rain to fall throughout  the  whole\r\n\r\nday;  it  suffices if there is a heavy  downpour  for\r\n\r\njust one or two hours, and Kampong Kembangan will  be\r\n\r\nflooded.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I have raised the  matter\r\n\r\nin  this  Chamber  in  December 1965.  I  quote  from\r\n\r\nHansard, Volume 24, No. 14, column 823:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'....when the rain falls for a short while, the\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan area is flooded  and  animals  and\r\n\r\nplants  are destroyed. Now is the best time  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Law and National Development  to  visit\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan Constituency, because it is now the\r\n\r\nrainy  season, and he will be able to see for himself\r\n\r\nthe condition of the drains in this area.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the earth roads become uneven and are\r\n\r\nimpassable to traffic. The Minister of State  on  one\r\n\r\noccasion  visited Kampong Kembangan  to  declare  the\r\n\r\nofficial opening of National Language Month.  He  was\r\n\r\ntravelling  in  a  big Jaguar car as  though  he  was\r\n\r\ntravelling  in  a  sampan. When the sun  shines,  the\r\n\r\nlaterite  roads become dusty and the houses, clothing\r\n\r\nand  food are covered with dust. This matter has also\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  by me in December 1965.  I  quote  from\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 24, No. 14, column 825:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now I would like to talk about the roads in Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan which are very bad. You can say that 90 per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the  roads there are earth roads.  When  it\r\n\r\nrains, the roads become muddy...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the drains become breeding grounds for\r\n\r\nmosquitoes. The water is stagnant, and during the hot\r\n\r\nweather rubbish is dumped into the drains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Kampong Kembangan is a low-lying area, it\r\n\r\nfollows  that  the  projects required  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nliving   standard  of  the  people  there  would   be\r\n\r\nproportionately higher. But, unfortunately, the funds\r\n\r\nprovided  for Kampong Kembangan arc not  enough.  For\r\n\r\nthis   year,  the  provision  for  Kampong  Kembangan\r\n\r\namounts to $60,000 only. Applications have been  made\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  and during the Prime Minister's  tour  of\r\n\r\nthe  Kampong Kembangan Constituency. Up  to  now  the\r\n\r\ndrains and roads have not been made up yet. The Urban\r\n\r\nand   Rural  Services  Committee  have,  on  so  many\r\n\r\noccasions,  visited the constituency; questions  were\r\n\r\nraised  in  this  House.  Nevertheless,  the  efforts\r\n\r\ncarried  out were practically nil. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis House has been informed why the roads could  not\r\n\r\nbe  made  up, because the land on both sides  of  the\r\n\r\nroads  to  be made up belongs to private owners.  For\r\n\r\nthis reason, the roads were made up under section 19,\r\n\r\nL.G.I.O.,  which requires the landowners to  pay  the\r\n\r\ncost  of making up the roads. On the contrary,  there\r\n\r\nare many roads in Jalan Alsagoff which have been made\r\n\r\nup according to kampong standards. Even more strange,\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational Development has said - I quote from Hansard,\r\n\r\nVolume 25, column 114:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, as the frontages are not yet well\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  these roads have been given low  priority\r\n\r\nand may not be made up until 1968.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cite an example, Mr Speaker, Woo Mun Chew Road\r\n\r\nand  many other roads in Siglap, where the laying  of\r\n\r\nsewers  has  just been completed, have  already  been\r\n\r\nmade  up; whereas in Kampong Kembangan the laying  of\r\n\r\nsewers  was  completed two years ago  and  the  roads\r\n\r\nuntil today have not been made up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is obvious that there is\r\n\r\ndiscrimination here. The people in the kampong do not\r\n\r\nget  proper  or  adequate treatment  as  compared  to\r\n\r\npeople who live in the built-up areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous earth drains which are full of\r\n\r\ngrass  and unattended to and water is unable to flow.\r\n\r\nWhen I referred the matter to the authorities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerned, the District Office passed it  on  to  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. which  in turn passed the buck  to  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade, and in the end nothing was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the large drain at Jalan Ang Teng from\r\n\r\nJalan  Pagak right up to Jalan Taugeh and finally  to\r\n\r\nGeylang  River. I referred the problem to the  proper\r\n\r\nauthorities  in 1963 for action to be taken  to  help\r\n\r\nthe  residents  against  the flood  menace.  When  it\r\n\r\nrains,  the vegetable gardens and poultry are  ruined\r\n\r\nby  the  floods  because the water  in  these  drains\r\n\r\ncannot flow smoothly. A large number of the residents\r\n\r\nin this area depend for their livelihood on vegetable\r\n\r\ngardening  and  poultry  rearing.  Mr  Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Merah, who previously resided  here,\r\n\r\nwill  corroborate what I have said. He has experience\r\n\r\nof how the residents here are suffering from this big\r\n\r\nproblem. I have already taken up the matter with  the\r\n\r\nresponsible  authorities. I made  a  site  inspection\r\n\r\nwith  the Work Brigade Engineer and later on  with  a\r\n\r\nP.W.D. Engineer. I also had occasion to accompany the\r\n\r\nSecretary,  U.R.S.C. But sad to say, the problem  has\r\n\r\nnot  yet been tackled up to today. Here I fail to see\r\n\r\nequal  treatment  to the haves and to  the  have-nots\r\n\r\nbeing  practised in the attempt to raise  the  living\r\n\r\nstandard  of the kampong people to the same level  as\r\n\r\nthat  of  the people in the urban areas, about  which\r\n\r\nthe Government has been trumpeting so loudly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nregarding  the  problems raised  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong Kembangan, as representatives from the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  we have the same feeling. For example,  during\r\n\r\nthe  floods  last month many places  in  the  kampong\r\n\r\nareas  were  flooded.  Many  vegetable  gardens  were\r\n\r\nflooded;  poultry died and losses were incurred.  The\r\n\r\nUrban  anti Rural Services Committee should pay  more\r\n\r\nattention  to  these problems and  should  visit  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. Low-lying areas must be protected  from\r\n\r\nfloods.   There  should  be  an  overall  scheme   to\r\n\r\nalleviate the flood situation so that people  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas would not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfaced  with the menace of floods, because they  would\r\n\r\nincur losses as a result of flooding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I believe that many rural toads\r\n\r\nhave  not been properly made up. They are in a  state\r\n\r\nof  disrepair.  I do not say that the  Government  is\r\n\r\ndiscriminating against the rural areas. We know  that\r\n\r\nit has treated the rural areas and the urban areas on\r\n\r\nthe same footing and it is trying its best to improve\r\n\r\nthe  living  conditions of the rural areas.  However,\r\n\r\nbecause this is the heritage of colonialism, there is\r\n\r\na  wide  gap  between the rural areas and  the  urban\r\n\r\nareas in living standards. I hope the Urban and Rural\r\n\r\nServices  Committee will provide more  funds  to  the\r\n\r\nrural areas for their projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the Jurong area only $91,000 has\r\n\r\nbeen  allotted.  Such a tiny sum of money  cannot  be\r\n\r\nused  to  develop that area. Therefore, as  a  Member\r\n\r\nfrom  the rural area I have the same feeling. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Urban and Rural Services Committee will increase\r\n\r\nthe  funds for projects in the rural areas to  enable\r\n\r\nthem to carry out their construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that construction work in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  should  be speedily  carried  out.  For\r\n\r\nexample,   last  October  I  asked  the   authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  repair a toad. But after  five  months\r\n\r\nnothing  has been done and no reply at all  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven.  There is a delay in carrying out construction\r\n\r\nwork  in the rural areas. I hope the Minister or  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary will pay more  attention  to\r\n\r\nthe projects which are to be carried out in the rural\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I share the sentiments expressed by the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan, because my constituency\r\n\r\nis  also  a  rural  area and I  know  very  well  the\r\n\r\nsituation  that is generally common in all the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  Fortunately, the Chairman of  the  Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee is here to listen to what  I\r\n\r\nhave to say and do something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say that the Government is discriminatory\r\n\r\nin  its  treatment of the urban and rural areas,  but\r\n\r\nthere  are many things which have to be improved  and\r\n\r\nneed  carrying out in the rural areas. There are  not\r\n\r\nenough funds to carry out the projects. For instance,\r\n\r\nthe  supply  of electricity, water and light  is  not\r\n\r\nprovided  in some rural areas because of  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nfunds.  Also certain rural roads have been  neglected\r\n\r\nby  the  Government ever since it came to power.  The\r\n\r\nidea  of  electing a representative in this House  is\r\n\r\nthat  he  should  do something constructive  for  his\r\n\r\nconstituency. We will be approaching 1968  soon  when\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament will have to stand for election\r\n\r\nagain. The present is a testing period for us. It is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, necessary for us to see that the supply of\r\n\r\nwater, electricity and gas is facilitated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I generally try to give the\r\n\r\nMinister  or  Parliamentary Secretary 12  minutes  to\r\n\r\nreply,  although there is no fixed rule about it.  I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, propose to ask the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for National Development  to  reply\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that during the last six or seven\r\n\r\nyears,  very  many  development  projects  have  been\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  Singapore, as anyone  can  see.  In\r\n\r\naddition  to  the building of schools, factories  and\r\n\r\nmulti-storey  flats, electricity and  water  supplies\r\n\r\nhave  been extended to kampong areas, roads have been\r\n\r\nmade  up in the kampongs, and street lights have been\r\n\r\ninstalled  in  the kampongs. All these projects  have\r\n\r\nbeen  carried  out  for the benefit  of  the  kampong\r\n\r\npeople.  For  projects carried out by the  Urban  and\r\n\r\nRural Services Committee, a total sum of. $22 million\r\n\r\nhad already been spent from 1961 to 1966. Out of this\r\n\r\namount, $1 million was spent on Kampong Kembangan  as\r\n\r\ncompared with $0.66 million spent on the neighbouring\r\n\r\nconstituency, Geylang Serai. From this figure, it can\r\n\r\nbe  seen that Kampong Kembangan Constituency was  not\r\n\r\nneglected,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about the other\r\n\r\nconstituencies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, Kampong Kembangan\r\n\r\nConstituency and Geylang Serai Constituency are below\r\n\r\nsea  level  and, therefore, flooding occurs  when  it\r\n\r\nrains  for a long time. I think there are two methods\r\n\r\nof  alleviating the floods in these areas. The  first\r\n\r\nmethod  is to fill up both these areas, to make  them\r\n\r\nhigher  than sea level, and the second method  is  to\r\n\r\npump  out  the flood water from these areas into  the\r\n\r\nsea.  However,  these two methods are very  expensive\r\n\r\nand  virtually impracticable as they would entail the\r\n\r\nwholesale shifting of houses to allow the work to  be\r\n\r\ndone.  One  method of alleviating  the  flood  is  to\r\n\r\ndestroy and clear overgrown vegetation from drains so\r\n\r\nthat    storm-waters   can   flow   freely    without\r\n\r\nobstruction. This work is usually carried out by  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade which, unfortunately, has been  reduced\r\n\r\nin  size to some 500 members and they have some other\r\n\r\nimportant  work  to attend to. But I suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan that the people in  this\r\n\r\narea can do a lot by self-help and community work ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

Recently in  Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang, the residents of Ama Keng did a very  good\r\n\r\njob of repairing Ama Keng Road (8th m.s. to 9th m.s.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Rome was not built in one day.

Sir, the  allocation\r\n\r\nof  funds  to each constituency was worked out  by  a\r\n\r\nCommittee of experts ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

If  he\r\n\r\nagrees,  my  Committee  is willing  to  provide  more\r\n\r\namenities  for  the people living in  the  rural  con\r\n\r\nstituencies.   In  any  case,  funds   allocated   to\r\n\r\nconstituencies have been decided and it is up to hon.\r\n\r\nMembers to make recommendations to the Government  on\r\n\r\nwhich  projects should be carried out first.

How is the  allocation\r\n\r\nof  funds  to  constituencies arrived at?  I  believe\r\n\r\nthere is a scheme whereby such allocation of funds is\r\n\r\nto  be  extended  over a period of, say,  six  years.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if, for example, Kampong Kembangan were to\r\n\r\nbe allocated $90,000 this year ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I  am  not trying to support the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary, but I am just trying to clarify one point.\r\n\r\nAs  it stands over a period of years, I am sure  that\r\n\r\nnot  only  the Constituency of Kampong Kembangan  but\r\n\r\nalso  the outlying areas wilt ultimately benefit.  As\r\n\r\nwas  said, \"Rome was not built in one day.\" I am sure\r\n\r\nthat  all  Members will have beaming  faces  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  when, after a period of five years,  they  can\r\n\r\nstand  up  and  say, \"Well, I have done  a  good  job\r\n\r\nbecause   over  this  period  of  years,  big   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment   projects   have   been   carried    out\r\n\r\nsystematically in my constituency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> On a point of clarification.
