A site in the delta between  the\r\n\r\nRochore  and  Kallang Rivers was first  considered  but\r\n\r\nwhen  the Merdeka Bridge project was under way  it  was\r\n\r\nfound  that the bridge had to be built further  seaward\r\n\r\nand the head-room under the bridge in this location was\r\n\r\nnot  sufficient to permit access to the  delta  by  the\r\n\r\nlarger  fishing vessels. A second site at the  southern\r\n\r\nend  of  Merdeka Bridge was then considered but it  was\r\n\r\nfound  to  be  too costly to build the  wholesale  fish\r\n\r\nmarket here. A third site, at the end of the old runway\r\n\r\nat  Kallang,  also  considered  to  be  suitable,  has,\r\n\r\nhowever, been earmarked for the development of a public\r\n\r\npark.  Finally, it has been proposed that  the  Central\r\n\r\nWholesale  Fish Market should be temporarily  sited  at\r\n\r\nthe  Telok  Ayer Basin. This proposal has not  received\r\n\r\nany  support  from  the Singapore Port  Commission  and\r\n\r\nwould  involve the finding of alternative accommodation\r\n\r\nfor  the  M.R.N.V.R. which would  in  itself  be  very\r\n\r\ncostly.

Financial assistance\r\n\r\nis  being given to local capital through the Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board and legislation to provide for  income\r\n\r\ntax   exemptions   to  new  or  additional   industries\r\n\r\nconsidered  to be of economic benefit to  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnow  in  the course of preparation as an inducement  to\r\n\r\nboth local and outside capital. Although there has been\r\n\r\nsome   response   from  outside  and   local   capital,\r\n\r\nGovernment notes with regret that its efforts  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  unemployment threat by encouragement of investment\r\n\r\nin  industries  are being frustrated  by  irresponsible\r\n\r\npoliticians who do not care what harm they  do  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. Government  therefore  considers\r\n\r\nthat the time has now come for more positive action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now approximately two years, Sir, since I gave\r\n\r\nan  indication  that some measure of  protection  might\r\n\r\nhave to be considered for our industries, but only as a\r\n\r\nlast resort. After careful consideration Government has\r\n\r\ncome to the conclusion that the principle of protection\r\n\r\nmust  be  recognised for our industries and  Government\r\n\r\nwill  therefore  commence taking immediately  all  such\r\n\r\nsteps   as  are  necessary  for  this  policy   to   be\r\n\r\nimplemented. Government recognises that entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nwill  always  continue to play  a  major  part  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy  and is therefore determined that the operation\r\n\r\nof  protection should be carried out with  the  minimum\r\n\r\npossible  damage  to, or dislocation of,  the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade. I wish to make it very clear therefore that  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  protection is envisaged  on  a  strictly\r\n\r\nselective  basis:  that  is,  only  where  the  benefit\r\n\r\naccruing  to  Singapore through the industry  concerned\r\n\r\noutweighs  any  possible harm to  the  entrepot  trade.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances will the operation of protection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to interfere in any way with the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade in produce, processed produce and textiles or raw\r\n\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will also have to be satisfied that any\r\n\r\nprotection  granted  will not be abused  and  that  the\r\n\r\nundertaking  concerned is operating or is  expected  to\r\n\r\noperate in an efficient manner and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  protection  would  not result  in  the  continued\r\n\r\nmarketing  of  goods of inferior quality  at  excessive\r\n\r\nprices  by comparison with the standards and prices  of\r\n\r\nsimilar  imported goods. The incidence  and  degree  of\r\n\r\nprotection  will have to be related to the capacity  of\r\n\r\nthe  local  industry  to meet the requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nlocal market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside manufacturers wishing to manufacture their\r\n\r\nproducts  here will, as a general rule, be required  to\r\n\r\ncome  to  an  arrangement with a local manufacturer  or\r\n\r\nintending  local  manufacturer, if  any,  of  the  same\r\n\r\nproduct,  or  failing  which with interested  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Such  arrangement  should  either  be  on  a\r\n\r\npartnership  basis with at least 49  per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nshares being held by the local interest or on the basis\r\n\r\nof  the  local interest manufacturing under licence  of\r\n\r\nthe  outside  manufacturer. If after a reasonable  time\r\n\r\nthere  is lack of response from local interests  or  if\r\n\r\nsuch arrangements cannot be made for reasons proved  to\r\n\r\nthe  satisfaction  of  the Minister  for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  the  outside  manufacturer  will  be   given\r\n\r\npermission to set up his own undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside manufacturers are invited to apply to the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Commerce and Industry if they  desire  to\r\n\r\nmanufacture  their  products  in  Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will give them every assistance to  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  local contacts and to carry out negotiations\r\n\r\nwith a view Lo entering into the arrangements mentioned\r\n\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restriction on outside manufacturers is necessary\r\n\r\nin  order  to encourage and safeguard local  industrial\r\n\r\ninvestment.

I  must  start  by  giving  you,   Sir,   an\r\n\r\nexplanation in connection with certain reports on  this\r\n\r\nsubject  which have been published in the  local  press\r\n\r\nsince I gave that promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having promised to make a statement in the Assembly, I\r\n\r\nfelt myself bound to make it to the Assembly and not to\r\n\r\nenquiring reporters beforehand. Consequently, I refused\r\n\r\nall  requests  by  reporters for a preview  of  what  I\r\n\r\nproposed  to  say,  telling  them  to  wait  until   my\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, some reports anticipating my statement\r\n\r\ndid  in fact appear in the press. There is no objection\r\n\r\nto that. Newspapers have a right, and indeed a duty, to\r\n\r\ncollect  information, to disseminate it and to  comment\r\n\r\non and even to guess about information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, some reports went beyond this. One\r\n\r\nnewspaper,  in particular, tried to present  itself  to\r\n\r\nthe  public as having had prior access through official\r\n\r\nsources  to the information I am this morning going  to\r\n\r\ngive  the House. It said that it had 'learned that  the\r\n\r\nCouncil of Ministers took a decision on Tuesday' to  go\r\n\r\nahead with a new Terminal building. In the same report,\r\n\r\nthis  newspaper attributed to 'a Civil Aviation source'\r\n\r\nalleged  information about Council discussions  on  the\r\n\r\nmatter and it also made a reference to the Director  of\r\n\r\nCivil Aviation in the same report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I had given secret information about Council\r\n\r\naffairs  to  a newspaper, or if any senior officer  had\r\n\r\ndone  so, the strictest disciplinary action would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  deserved. I have, however, made the most  careful\r\n\r\ninvestigation and I do not believe that this  newspaper\r\n\r\nhad  any  access  to such secret information,  nor  any\r\n\r\ninformation at all about the matters in my statement. I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  its  report  was  no  more  than   what\r\n\r\nreporters call 'intelligent guesswork' plus a rehash of\r\n\r\ninformation already available to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not concerned, Sir, to express an opinion of the\r\n\r\njournalistic morality of a newspaper proceeding in this\r\n\r\nway.  Hon. Members can judge that for themselves. I  do\r\n\r\nwish  to  make  it  absolutely clear that  I  have  not\r\n\r\nderogated  from  the proper dignity of  this  House  by\r\n\r\ngiving to the Press prior access to information which I\r\n\r\nhad  promised  to give to the House. Such action  could\r\n\r\nonly  be  justified in circumstances of grave  urgency,\r\n\r\nsuch as have not arisen in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, successive governments, both before and since\r\n\r\nthe  outbreak  of  that international insanity  usually\r\n\r\ncalled World War II, have recognised the importance  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  Singapore as a centre for air travel.  The\r\n\r\nresult,  based on wise and forethoughtful planning  and\r\n\r\nfruitful  consultation with the airline  operators,  is\r\n\r\nthat  today  Singapore has a first-rate  basic  Airport\r\n\r\nwith  heavy  and increasing traffic. We  have  a  good,\r\n\r\nthough  not  a  final, picture of the probable  traffic\r\n\r\ndevelopments over the next few years. Planning is quite\r\n\r\nup-to-date. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow the suitable next steps to take. We propose to  go\r\n\r\nahead according to plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had intended to let tenders for the next stage of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  during  May of this  year.  Owing  to  the\r\n\r\nrecession,  I decided that letting should  be  deferred\r\n\r\nfor  a  short  period. I did not like  doing  that;  it\r\n\r\nimposes   a  hardship  on  the  contractors  who   have\r\n\r\ntendered.  It  was  necessary  to  give  time   for   a\r\n\r\nre-examination  of  certain technical and  accommodation\r\n\r\naspects. Following re-examination, we are going to defer\r\n\r\nfor  a  while  one  section of the  building  proposals\r\n\r\ncosting  approximately $375,000. Apart  from  that,  we\r\n\r\nhave found nothing that ought to be varied or deferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, of course, lost two months of development\r\n\r\nrime,  which  I regret. When one is dealing  with  very\r\n\r\nclosely-knit plans, it is not safe to excise  one  part\r\n\r\nwithout  most  careful examination of the  whole.  Such\r\n\r\nexamination  takes time, which has reduced our  margin,\r\n\r\nbut  that must be accepted as one of the results of the\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals now to go forward are the erection of a\r\n\r\nbuilding  from which the operational control  functions\r\n\r\nof  the  Airport will be exercised, together  with  the\r\n\r\ninstallation  of the necessary equipment. Hon, members\r\n\r\nhad  better understand the context in which this  takes\r\n\r\nplace. Operational controls cover two fields. The first\r\n\r\nis  the  Flight  Information Region, an area  of  about\r\n\r\n140,000   square  miles,  centred  on  Singapore.   All\r\n\r\naircraft  movements within this region, both Civil  and\r\n\r\nMilitary,  are rigorously controlled so as to  maintain\r\n\r\nsafe   aircraft  route-patterns  and  to   avoid   the\r\n\r\ngeneration of aerial hazards. The second field  is  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Terminal  Area of  about  150  miles  radial\r\n\r\ndistance from Singapore, in which even more precise and\r\n\r\npositive  disciplines  have  to  be  imposed   on   the\r\n\r\nmovements  of aircraft. The average number of movements\r\n\r\nin  the  Area is approximately 10,000 a month. In  peak\r\n\r\nperiods it may rise as high as 50 movements per hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing system of control has worked well, but\r\n\r\nwill   not  much  longer  be  adequate  to  cover   the\r\n\r\nincreasing  frequency and rapidity of movements.  Civil\r\n\r\nand  military  planes using our airspace and  the  area\r\n\r\naround continually progress in numbers and speeds. Hon.\r\n\r\nmembers will appreciate that if a plane flying south at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n500 miles per hour confronts another plane flying north\r\n\r\nat  the  same speed, they approach each other at  1,000\r\n\r\nmiles  an  hour.  This leaves no margin  for  emergency\r\n\r\ndecisions and introduces an element of risk that cannot\r\n\r\nbe  accepted. The risk can only be avoided by having  a\r\n\r\nfirst-rate system of controls operating through  first-rate equipment. This we mean to have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to provide a new Control Tower\r\n\r\napproximately  120  feet  high,  plus  a   seven-storey\r\n\r\nbuilding giving rather more than 40,000 square feet  of\r\n\r\nfloor  space. Very roughly, 50 per cent of  this  space\r\n\r\nwill   be   used   for  installation  of,   operational\r\n\r\nequipment;  15 per cent will be used for  the  officers\r\n\r\ndealing with the equipment and its product; and 35  per\r\n\r\ncent  will be rentable space for the Operations  Rooms\r\n\r\nof the airlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building will house the Area Joint Air Traffic\r\n\r\nControl Centre, the Area Communications Centre, the Air\r\n\r\nInformation  Centre, a Military Air  Movement  Section,\r\n\r\nand  the main Aviation-Meteorological Office in  South-East  Asia.  Its  equipment consists  of  a  completely\r\n\r\noverhauled,   integrated  and  up-to-date   Air   Fixed\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  Network, an Airport  exchange,  and\r\n\r\nthe  terminals of the operational aids installed at the\r\n\r\nairport's periphery. These aids include a Visual  Omni-Range beacon, which gives a pilot the assurance that he\r\n\r\nis  precisely on the course given him, and Surveillance\r\n\r\nRadar,  which  tells the Airport if he  gets  off  this\r\n\r\ncourse so that they can correct him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately and without allowance for unforeseeable\r\n\r\nde1ays    or   circumstances   beyond   our    control,\r\n\r\nconstruction  of this building will be  complete  about\r\n\r\nthe  third  quarter  of 1959, and installation  of  the\r\n\r\nequipment  about four months later. The  whole  project\r\n\r\nshould be in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperation  about  February, 1960.  As  near  as  I  can\r\n\r\nforecast,  this  is  about the date  that  our  present\r\n\r\ncontrol  system  will  become  inadequate  for  traffic\r\n\r\nneeds, and the new system will be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the building will be about. $2,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis   includes  special  feature  necessary  for   the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnical installations. It works out at about $25  per\r\n\r\nsquare foot of total floor space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of the equipment and plant of all kinds to go\r\n\r\ninto  the  building and at the periphery will be  about\r\n\r\n$2,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point which has been provided for in\r\n\r\nthis  building  is  that  one  roof  houses  both   the\r\n\r\nairlines'   operational  teams   and   the   specialist\r\n\r\ndepartments on whose services they depend. As the  time\r\n\r\navailable for flight-planning and for briefing of  air-crews  is  limited, especially for jets whose  economic\r\n\r\noperation calls for minimum time on the ground, this is\r\n\r\nan  important  factor of efficiency.  The  building  is\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  enable  the fullest co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\nairport staff and of the operators with offices in  the\r\n\r\nsame building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this development which I have described in\r\n\r\nsome detail, we must also provide additional length for\r\n\r\nthe runway, additional taxi-tracks, and special aprons.\r\n\r\nThese  are under engineering study, and I am not  going\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto be specific about them. I can say that we may not be\r\n\r\nable  to  keep  their cost below $2,000,000;  the  cost\r\n\r\ncould be a good deal more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These works and installations may be called Phase II\r\n\r\nof  the current development at Paya Lebar. Phase I  was\r\n\r\nthe  International  Posts Building.  When  we  deferred\r\n\r\nletting  tenders  for  Phase II  Part  One,  some  ill-informed  rumours  got round that  the  Government  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to postpone development indefinitely. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink anyone who knew anything about the matter thought\r\n\r\nthese rumours were true or were likely to be true,  but\r\n\r\nthey  were repeated in the Press. I therefore issued  a\r\n\r\nrelease on 25th June, in which I said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Airport is essential to Singapore's prosperity\r\n\r\nand  the  Government will see that it fully  meets  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  our  expanding air traffic. Rumours  to  the\r\n\r\ncontrary  are damaging to Singapore and I categorically\r\n\r\ndeny them\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case similar silly rumours get about again, I\r\n\r\nrepeat   that   denial  and  I  reassert   Government's\r\n\r\nintention  to  see  that our international  Airport  is\r\n\r\nequipped to provoke adequate services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Question Time, the Member for Tanglin asked about\r\n\r\nnew construction for expeditious handling of passengers\r\n\r\nand  freight, that is for what we may call  Phase  III,\r\n\r\nthat  aspect of the Airport which deals with the people\r\n\r\nand  goods  once  they  have  through  the  Operational\r\n\r\nControls  been brought safely down to earth.  For  this\r\n\r\naspect,   we  must  have  airline  processing  offices;\r\n\r\naccommodation  for  Customs,  Immigration  and   Health\r\n\r\ncontrols;  public  concourses, restaurants, lavatories\r\n\r\nand  enquiry desks; shops and stands; Press and  V.I.P.\r\n\r\nrooms; and a mass of similar accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings at present used for these purposes were\r\n\r\ndesigned  for early transfer to engineering and  stores\r\n\r\nuse,  with a new Terminal Building to take their place.\r\n\r\nThis  transfer  cannot be indefinitely  deferred.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  buildings  are getting  to  be  chock-a-block.\r\n\r\nPlans  for  the new Phase III buildings have been  kept\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinuously    up    to   date,   with    considerable\r\n\r\nmodifications from the first proposals, chiefly in  the\r\n\r\ndirection of simplicity and economy. It may be possible\r\n\r\nor  desirable to modify them further. In their  present\r\n\r\nform,  they would cost between 2 and 3 million  dollars\r\n\r\nto erect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members  understand that we  are  faced  with  a\r\n\r\npossibly serious diminution of national revenue due  to\r\n\r\nthe  recession. In such circumstances, all  investments\r\n\r\non  public  account must be carefully  scrutinised  and\r\n\r\ntheir   desirability  weighed  against  other  possible\r\n\r\ninvestments  of limited funds. Hon. Members  will  also\r\n\r\naccept that large sections of public spending ought not\r\n\r\nto   be   cut   down,   and  that  certain   types   of\r\n\r\ninvestment - different  Members  may   favour   different\r\n\r\ntypes -   must  go on. An investment of 2  or  3  million\r\n\r\ndollars  for Phase III at Paya Lebar will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nweighed  against other needs and given priority  within\r\n\r\nthe  context of available funds. I am not going  to  be\r\n\r\nmore specific than that at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like now to make a point about the value of\r\n\r\nthe Government's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  the  International  Airport.  We   can\r\n\r\ndescribe  ourselves as being in the  entrepot  business\r\n\r\nfor  passengers  in much the same way  as  we  are  for\r\n\r\ngoods.  We  receive passengers in bulk  and  distribute\r\n\r\nthem  in small parcels throughout South East Asia, and,\r\n\r\nsimilarly,  we collect small parcels of passengers  and\r\n\r\nbulk  them for delivery to major points overseas.  That\r\n\r\nis  the major business at Paya Lebar. The proportion of\r\n\r\nthrough  or transit passengers, that is those who  stay\r\n\r\nin  Singapore only for an hour or two, is about 15  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the total. The other 85 per cent stop over  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  varying periods, and thus  bring  us  a\r\n\r\nvaluable  inflow of cash. The volume of  passengers  is\r\n\r\nsteadily increasing and during the first six months  of\r\n\r\n1958  was 134,124, an increase of 15 per cent over  the\r\n\r\nsame  period in 1957. This is a very valuable  item  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's balance of payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will also be aware of the direct revenue\r\n\r\naspect of our Airport  - indeed, a question earlier  this\r\n\r\nmorning  has  focused attention on it. Returns  on  our\r\n\r\nlarge  investment at Paya Lebar need  not  be  measured\r\n\r\nsolely in terms of tourist revenue. We can also set off\r\n\r\ndirect  revenue  received at the  Airport  against  its\r\n\r\nrecurrent   costs.   Items  such   as   landing   fees,\r\n\r\nconcessions  and rents bring cash which helps  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe costs of running the airport. I do not know that we\r\n\r\ncan at present expect that we can from this source look\r\n\r\nfor to a direct profit on our investment. To set direct\r\n\r\nprofit  on the investment as an objective might  defeat\r\n\r\nthe  objects for which the investment was made. We are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  aiming to get a revenue sufficient  to  cover\r\n\r\nthe  costs of operating the Airport, that is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat,  taking one year with another, we do not  have  a\r\n\r\nloss on working account. We have not reached that point\r\n\r\nof revenue yet, and in order to reach it, we must have,\r\n\r\nas  in the Phase II building, investment in the sort of\r\n\r\naccommodation that makes it possible to earn revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an interesting point of public finance to argue\r\n\r\nwhether in a period of financial stringency one  should\r\n\r\nmake  one's  national investments in  directly  wealth-producing projects or in others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  greater social value. I am not going to argue  that\r\n\r\npoint  here and now. I only want to assure hon. Members\r\n\r\nthat  in  considering  the future  development  of  our\r\n\r\ninternational  Airport  that  aspect   has   not   been\r\n\r\nforgotten and will not be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for\r\n\r\nhis  lengthy  exposition but I would like  to  ask  him\r\n\r\nwhether -  you will agree it is a fact that the  Airport\r\n\r\nis   a  revenue  producing  asset -  Phase  III  of  the\r\n\r\noperation  is  more important or just as  important  as\r\n\r\nPhase II and is it proper that it should be delayed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This is indeed, Sir, the very point to\r\n\r\nwhich I referred in my peroration.

The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  Board is elected  from  amongst  the\r\n\r\nmembers  and,  like  the other  members,  works  in  an\r\n\r\nhonorary capacity only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pineapple industry in this country during\r\n\r\nthe  postwar  years and particularly since  the  latter\r\n\r\npart  of 1956 has encountered many difficulties in  the\r\n\r\nface   of   ever-increasing  competition   from   other\r\n\r\nproducing  countries in overseas markets,  and  it  has\r\n\r\nbecome   apparent  that  a  continuous  and   energetic\r\n\r\ndirection is necessary in the conduct of the affairs of\r\n\r\nthis industry, particularly in promoting effective  co-ordination in the production, processing and  marketing\r\n\r\naspects  of  the industry. It is for this reason,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill is designed to provide for  the  joint\r\n\r\nappointment  by  the Governor and the Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nAgong  of an independent Chairman on a salary basis  in\r\n\r\nplace  of  the  present elected Chairman. This  measure\r\n\r\nwill  also  serve  to  remove the objection  which  can\r\n\r\nlegitimately  be raised to the election of  a  Chairman\r\n\r\nwho  may  be  said  to be the nominee of  a  particular\r\n\r\nsection of the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is further considered essential by the two\r\n\r\nGovernments  that  representation on the  Board  should\r\n\r\nappropriately  reflect the importance of the  different\r\n\r\ninterests  concerned in the pineapple  industry.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  present  Ordinance the Board is  now  composed  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representative of the Singapore Government;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representative of the Federation Government;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three representatives of State Governments;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Agriculture, Federation of Malaya;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner for Co-operative Development,\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Canners Representative Association, who is from Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six representatives of canners, two of whom are from\r\n\r\nSingapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two representatives of exporters, both from\r\n\r\nSingapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representative of can suppliers, also from\r\n\r\nSingapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three representatives of small growers, all from the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is thought that a more equitable representation of\r\n\r\nthe  various interests on the Board would be  achieved\r\n\r\nby  the proposals in the Bill to delete paragraphs (f)\r\n\r\nand  (j)  of  section 3 (2) of the present  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nwhich provides for the appointment on the Board of the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Canners Representative Association and\r\n\r\na  representative of can suppliers respectively.

Under  these\r\n\r\nregulations,  the  public service is divided  into  two\r\n\r\nclasses  of  what are known as the restricted  and  the\r\n\r\nunrestricted class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restricted class, which embodies all officers\r\n\r\nemployed in an administrative or executive capacity, as\r\n\r\nwell  as  other officers whose duties bring  them  into\r\n\r\ncontact  with the formulation and execution of  policy,\r\n\r\ncomprises  all officers in Divisions I and  II  of  the\r\n\r\npublic service and a proportion of officers in Division\r\n\r\nIII.  These officers are not subject to any restriction\r\n\r\non  their right of private exercise of the franchise or\r\n\r\nof  their  liberty to be members of a political  party,\r\n\r\nbut  they are otherwise prohibited from engaging in any\r\n\r\npolitical  activity  whatsoever  and  are  required  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  complete reserve in all political matters  or\r\n\r\nmatters of public controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers in the unrestricted class, which comprises\r\n\r\nall officers in Division IV of the public service,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as daily-rated employees and a limited number  of\r\n\r\nofficers  in  Division III whose duties are essentially\r\n\r\nof  a  technical  nature, are  permitted  to  stand  as\r\n\r\ncandidates for election to the Legislative Assembly  or\r\n\r\nto  any  local government authority as well as to  hold\r\n\r\noffice in political organisations. Any such officer who\r\n\r\nis  nominated  as  a  candidate  for  election  to  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly or a local government authority is\r\n\r\ngranted  the  leave  due  to  him  together  with   any\r\n\r\nadditional  unrecorded leave without pay which  may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary to cover the period up to Polling Day. If  he\r\n\r\nis  elected, such an officer is required to retire from\r\n\r\nthe  service  with  effect from  Polling  Day.  On  his\r\n\r\nceasing  to  be  a member of the Assembly  or  a  local\r\n\r\ngovernment  authority,  as  the  case  may  be,  he  is\r\n\r\neligible  for  re-employment  in  the  public   service\r\n\r\nsubject to certain conditions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  he is then permitted to count his  service\r\n\r\nprior  to  and  after the break as continuous  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of the Pensions Ordinance. Under section 7 (3)\r\n\r\nof that Ordinance, he is eligible, whether or not he is\r\n\r\nsubsequently reemployed in the public service, for  the\r\n\r\naward  of a pension on his attaining the age of 50,  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of a man, and 45, in the case of a woman.  If\r\n\r\nsuch  an  officer  fails  to  obtain  election,  he  is\r\n\r\nimmediately re-employed in the public service and he is\r\n\r\nrequired to return to duty on the day following that on\r\n\r\nwhich the result of the election is declared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment in the Bill before the House\r\n\r\nseeks  to  remove one minor anomaly in connection  with\r\n\r\nthe  provision for awarding pensions to such  officers.\r\n\r\nAs  the law stands, they do not become eligible for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naward  of a pension until they reach the ages  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned, i.e., 50 years for a man and 45  years\r\n\r\nfor  a  woman. This, however, fails to take account  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact that there are certain categories of officers\r\n\r\nwhose minimum age of retirement under subsection (2) of\r\n\r\nsection 7 of the Pensions Ordinance is lower than these\r\n\r\nages. The effect of the amendment is therefore to bring\r\n\r\nthe  age  of eligibility for the award of a pension  in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of an officer in the unrestricted class  who\r\n\r\nretires to take up political activities into line  with\r\n\r\nthe  minimum  age at which he would be eligible  for  a\r\n\r\npension if he retired in other circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment proposed in the Bill now before\r\n\r\nthe   House  relates  to  officers  in  the  restricted\r\n\r\ncategory.  There  are  a number  of  officers  in  this\r\n\r\ncategory  with  considerable  lengths  of  service  who\r\n\r\njoined   the  public  service  at  a  time   when   the\r\n\r\nopportunity of a political career did not exist.  While\r\n\r\nit  is  desired  to maintain the strict principle  that\r\n\r\nofficers in the administrative and executive grades  of\r\n\r\nthe public service, since they constitute the machinery\r\n\r\nthrough which the elected government of the day carries\r\n\r\nout  its  policies, should properly  be  debarred  from\r\n\r\nparticipating in political activities, it is considered\r\n\r\nreasonable,  in connection with the first elections  to\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Assembly under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  constitution  which  will  confer  internal  self-government  on  Singapore, to give  an  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nofficers in this class also, who have a genuine  desire\r\n\r\nto  serve  their  country in the  political  field,  to\r\n\r\nretire from the public service in order to do so. It is\r\n\r\nnot  proposed to perpetuate this concession but to make\r\n\r\nit   a  single,  once  and  for  all  opportunity,  and\r\n\r\nhereafter  the  principle to which I have  referred  of\r\n\r\ndebarring the administrative ranks of the civil service\r\n\r\nfrom  political activities will be strictly maintained.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment  in this Bill seeks to provide  for  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naward  of  pensions to such officers even  though  they\r\n\r\nhave  not  reached the minimum retiring age.  They  are\r\n\r\nrequired to have completed 15 years' public service  or\r\n\r\nten  years' public service and to have attained the age\r\n\r\nof  40  years.  Such officers will not be eligible  for\r\n\r\nreinstatement  in  the  public  service  whether   they\r\n\r\nsucceed   in  obtaining  election  to  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  or  not; and the amendment to  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nconsequently provides that a pension can be awarded  to\r\n\r\nthem  without  waiting  until they  have  attained  the\r\n\r\nnormal minimum age of retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also to be noted that a similar concession to\r\n\r\npublic  officers  was  made in the  Federation  on  the\r\n\r\noccasion of their last general election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should finally add that the arrangements made on\r\n\r\nthis occasion and which necessitate these amendments to\r\n\r\nthe   Pensions   Ordinance  have  been  adopted   after\r\n\r\nnegotiations with the Staff Side of the Singapore Civil\r\n\r\nService Joint Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Assistant Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohd.Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> Sir, I beg to second.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.25 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas   the  Party  most  likely  to  benefit  from   this\r\n\r\namendment, we welcome the Bill. It is not a habit which\r\n\r\nwe should encourage in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service, but once in the  lifetime  of  the\r\n\r\nColony  of  Singapore, particularly when one period  of\r\n\r\nthat  life is coming to a close in the next few months,\r\n\r\nwe  should  give  this opportunity to people  who  have\r\n\r\nshown   from   their  past  activities,  qualities   of\r\n\r\nleadership, political courage and moral convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that some members of the civil\r\n\r\nservice  are  unhappy  at  some  very  senior  officers\r\n\r\nleaving the service in order to participate in the open\r\n\r\npolitical  fight. But the choice which this country  is\r\n\r\nfacing  is either to have honest and able Ministers  to\r\n\r\nlead, or to have honest and able civil servants led  by\r\n\r\nnot  so  honest and not so able Ministers. The position\r\n\r\nof  those who are concerned with the welfare and  well-being  of  this country is one which cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\nThose  who are retiring under this amending Bill  could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell sit back in the security and the comfort of a well-paid civil service. But because they are fully aware of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  going on with the fortunes of the  government\r\n\r\nand  the  people,  they cannot just be spectators,  or,\r\n\r\nworse,  unwilling tools in the destruction of  a  happy\r\n\r\nand prosperous community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a matter for regret, of\r\n\r\ncourse, that other political Parties are unlikely to be\r\n\r\nable  to take advantage of this Bill. I would back  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and I think in this instance it is not  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front Coalition faction of the Government  which\r\n\r\nhas  decided this particular Bill, but more those  who,\r\n\r\nbecause they are not concerned with the inter-party day-to-day  trends  of the country, are therefore  able  to\r\n\r\ntake a more disinterested and dispassionate view of the\r\n\r\nultimate  fight in this country, whether the democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  survives, or whether it goes under  because  of\r\n\r\nineptitude, stupidities and corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome this Bill and I would like to say, for the\r\n\r\nrecord of this Assembly, that those who are given  this\r\n\r\nopportunity will do credit to the community which  they\r\n\r\nare seeking to serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply, Mr David?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, just a very few brief words.

I would also like to\r\n\r\nemphasise  that the decision which has  been  taken  in\r\n\r\nthis case is a collective one by the present Government\r\n\r\nand  no individual Minister is more responsible for  it\r\n\r\nthan any other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.

Now it is proper to speak not of \"laying\"  but\r\n\r\nof  \"presenting\"  papers to the Assembly  and  Standing\r\n\r\nOrder No. 12 says explicitly how this should be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another aspect in which the phraseology used in\r\n\r\nsome  Ordinances  is  now inappropriate  is  that  some\r\n\r\ncontain references to action which may be taken by  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  by  way  of  approval or  annulment  at  some\r\n\r\nmeeting  subsequent to the meeting at  which  they  are\r\n\r\nlaid.  These references to meetings are now  misleading\r\n\r\nand it is clear that when the legislature enacted these\r\n\r\nvarious Ordinances, it had in mind what we now refer to\r\n\r\nas sittings. I do not think I need embark on a detailed\r\n\r\nexposition  of  the  technical difference  between  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of the word \"meeting\", as used in the days  of\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Council, and the words  \"meeting\"  and\r\n\r\n\"sitting\", as used now in relation to the procedure  of\r\n\r\nthis House. The words \"sitting\" and \"sitting days\" are,\r\n\r\nI  think, fully understood by all hon. Members  present\r\n\r\nand I do not wish to take up their time unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated, perhaps too briefly, in the explanatory\r\n\r\nstatement appended to the Bill, the main object of  the\r\n\r\nBill  is  to bring the now old-fashioned provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe  various Ordinances referred to in the Schedule  up\r\n\r\nto date in the respects I have indicated, and to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the Ordinances of the Colony will be in line with\r\n\r\nthe present procedure of this House. But the matter  is\r\n\r\nperhaps  just a little more complicated than I have  so\r\n\r\nfar  indicated. Some Ordinances provide for  subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation  to be laid as soon as possible  after  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  thereof, without reference to  publication  in\r\n\r\nthe  Gazette;  others for laying at the  first  meeting\r\n\r\nafter   publication.  Some  provide  for  approval   or\r\n\r\nannulment  by  a resolution passed within a  particular\r\n\r\nperiod of time - variously one, two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor   three  months.  Others  provide  for  approval  or\r\n\r\nannulment without specifying any particular time.  Some\r\n\r\nsay  merely \"at some meeting subsequent to the  meeting\r\n\r\nat which they are laid\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while the exact form of words used must\r\n\r\nnecessarily  vary  from Ordinance to Ordinance,  unless\r\n\r\nthere is to be a comprehensive revision, which would be\r\n\r\na  major undertaking, it is desirable that there should\r\n\r\nbe some uniformity and, particularly, that the Assembly\r\n\r\nshould  know  with certainty its powers in  respect  of\r\n\r\nsubsidiary   legislation  for  which  it  is   directly\r\n\r\nresponsible,  by  reason of the  need  for  affirmative\r\n\r\napproval,  and in respect of legislation which  it  has\r\n\r\nexpress powers to annul or vary by resolution. To these\r\n\r\nends, therefore, this Bill proposes the achievement  of\r\n\r\nsuch  uniformity as is readily possible by the adoption\r\n\r\nof a common form of words and the insertion, where none\r\n\r\nexists  at  present, of a specific period within  which\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  may  act.  The principle  on  which  the\r\n\r\nSchedule  to this Bill has been prepared is that  where\r\n\r\nno  period  is  at present mentioned, it shall  be  not\r\n\r\nlater  than the first available sitting day next  after\r\n\r\nthe  expiry  of  one month from presentation.  Where  a\r\n\r\nperiod is already specified in an Ordinance, that  same\r\n\r\nperiod - be it one, two or three months - should have been\r\n\r\nadopted. Unfortunately I now find that in the course of\r\n\r\nseeking further uniformity, some errors have crept into\r\n\r\nthe  drafting and, in some instances, the periods  have\r\n\r\nbeen incorrectly set out. In respect of these errors, I\r\n\r\nshall  at the Committee stage seek the approval of  the\r\n\r\nHouse to correct them and also to delete a reference to\r\n\r\none  Ordinance which has been repealed since the  first\r\n\r\ndraft  of this Bill was prepared and to insert  another\r\n\r\nthat'  was  overlooked. But these, together with  other\r\n\r\nmatters  brought  to  my  notice  since  the  Bill  was\r\n\r\npublished, for which I am most grateful, are not  major\r\n\r\nmatters  of principle. The principles of the Bill  are,\r\n\r\nas I have said, to bring our legislation up to date and\r\n\r\nto  seek to achieve some uniformity and clear certainty\r\n\r\nas to the powers of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee Wednesday, 10th September, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.43 a.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is one of the most important pieces of\r\n\r\nlegislation that has come up before this House.  It  is\r\n\r\ndrafted   primarily   to   implement   those   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  into\r\n\r\nCorrupt,  Illegal or Undesirable Practices at Elections\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been accepted by Government. Although  the\r\n\r\nReport  itself  was  not debated by this  Assembly,  it\r\n\r\nformed  the basis of a debate on a motion by  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanjong Pagar at the last Assembly sitting.\r\n\r\nIt  was  gratifying  to  note  then  that  whilst  some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeakers criticised the Report in varying degrees, none\r\n\r\ncriticised the recommendations of the Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ten years now, Sir, the people of Singapore have\r\n\r\nhad   experience  of  elections,  and  it  has   become\r\n\r\napparent, during the course of these experiences,  that\r\n\r\nas  the years go by certain unimaginable and disruptive\r\n\r\nforces  have crept into the machinery of elections.  On\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand,  you  have the element  of  corruption,\r\n\r\nthuggery  and intimidation; on the other, the insidious\r\n\r\ninfiltration  into  our  lawful  political   arena   of\r\n\r\nCommunism  and Communist tactics. Though the  Bill,  as\r\n\r\ndrafted,  is designed to wipe out the former, it  would\r\n\r\ninevitably  lead to a lessening of the  threat  of  the\r\n\r\nlatter,  for  Communism cannot thrive without  thuggery\r\n\r\nand intimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question before this House and before the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimple: Do we want clean elections or not? It is in our\r\n\r\nhands  to decide, for what we decide today will  surely\r\n\r\naffect  the future of Singapore and the future  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren.  We certainly do not want their  fate  to  be\r\n\r\ntossed about from one gang boss to another; still  less\r\n\r\ndo  we  want  their future to be left in the  hands  of\r\n\r\ncorrupt politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will help to bring about a change for the\r\n\r\nbetter.  There are actually two parts to  it,  although\r\n\r\nthey are not so identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first are amendments not connected with the Elias\r\n\r\nReport,  but which Government feels should be  included\r\n\r\nin the legislation for reasons which I shall enumerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill changes the date from which\r\n\r\nresidence in Singapore is to be counted for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  preparing registers of electors from 1st  April  to\r\n\r\n1st  February. This follows a similar change which  has\r\n\r\nbeen   made  to  the  Singapore  Legislative   Assembly\r\n\r\nElections Ordinance and makes it easier for those doing\r\n\r\nthe  work of compiling to publish both registers  about\r\n\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill remove the\r\n\r\nmandatory provisions of the Ordinance which require the\r\n\r\npublication in newspapers of various election  notices.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the notices in the form required  by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance in newspapers has entailed heavy costs in\r\n\r\nadvertisement  charges. It is intended, Sir,  that  for\r\n\r\nthe  future  a short advertisement will be inserted  in\r\n\r\nthe newspapers which will refer to the detailed notices\r\n\r\nin the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill will make it unnecessary to\r\n\r\nundertake  a  revision of the register of  electors  in\r\n\r\n1958  or  in  any year in which the register  is  newly\r\n\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill amends section 57 of the Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Elections Ordinance, 1957, to make it clear\r\n\r\nthat  although prosecutions for corrupt practices  can\r\n\r\nonly  be instituted with the sanction of the Attorney-General, the police may, nevertheless, take immediate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naction  to investigate any alleged corrupt practice  or\r\n\r\nto prevent the continuance of any corrupt practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is the first part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second\r\n\r\npart   of   the   Bill   deals   primarily   with   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Commission of Inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill seeks to expand and simplify\r\n\r\nthe  provision regarding \"treating\". It implements  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of the Commission of Inquiry  that  the\r\n\r\noffence  of treating should be extended to include  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  food, drink, refreshment, cigarettes  or\r\n\r\nentertainment to any person for the purpose of inducing\r\n\r\nsuch person to attend or remain at an election meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill implements the recommendation\r\n\r\nof the Commission of Inquiry that there should be added\r\n\r\nto the several forms of bribery under section 56 of the\r\n\r\nLocal Government Elections Ordinance, 1957, a provision\r\n\r\nmaking it an offence for any person to bribe any  other\r\n\r\nperson  who  is assisting or has promised to  assist  a\r\n\r\ncandidate at an election in order to induce him not  to\r\n\r\nassist that candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 of the Bill prohibits the use of motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  for  conveying  voters  to  the  poll.   This\r\n\r\nimplements  the  recommendations of the  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  as contained in paragraph 93 of their  Report.\r\n\r\nIn  this  connection, it will be necessary  to  provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  polling  stations  so that  voters  will  not  be\r\n\r\ncompelled  to walk long distances to cast their  votes,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 of the Bill implements the recommendation\r\n\r\nof  the  Commission of Inquiry that on Polling  Day  no\r\n\r\nvehicle   should  be  permitted  to  carry  or  display\r\n\r\nanything (including any rosette or favour) which  would\r\n\r\nindicate connection with any candidate or his political\r\n\r\nParty.  In  order to make the provisions  effective,  a\r\n\r\ncontravention of them is made seizable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 adds five new sections. The first section\r\n\r\nprohibits canvassing on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolling  Day  to  implement the recommendation  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry in paragraph 90 of their  Report.\r\n\r\nThe  second  section  prohibits, inter  alia,  (a)  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchecking of names of persons entering polling stations,\r\n\r\nand  (b)  loitering  within 200 yards  of  any  polling\r\n\r\nstation. These provisions implement the recommendations\r\n\r\nof the Commission of Inquiry in paragraphs 98 and 99 of\r\n\r\ntheir   Report.  The  third  section  defines  election\r\n\r\nactivity and prohibits any person under 21 years of age\r\n\r\nconducting  any  election activity. It also  implements\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry  that\r\n\r\nno  person  should  be allowed to conduct  an  election\r\n\r\nactivity  on  behalf  of  a  candidate  without   being\r\n\r\nappointed in writing to do so by the candidate and that\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner of Police may require the cancellation\r\n\r\nof any authority given to a person by a candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth section provides that an assembly of five\r\n\r\nor  more  persons  whose intention  is  to  disrupt  an\r\n\r\nelection  meeting  shall be an unlawful  assembly.  The\r\n\r\nfifth section makes it a seizable offence to operate  a\r\n\r\nloudspeaker  so  as  to  interfere  with  the  election\r\n\r\nmeeting  or  maliciously  to deface  election  posters.\r\n\r\nThese two sections implement the recommendations of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry in paragraph 106 of their Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one major and controversial\r\n\r\nrecommendation which is not included in the  Bill,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  question of compulsory  voting.  Various\r\n\r\nviews  have  been expressed on this issue and  although\r\n\r\nthe   Bill   does   not  include  this  recommendation,\r\n\r\nGovernment does not wish to prevent it from being aired\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly, nor does it wish to bind itself  for\r\n\r\nthe time being without properly sounding public opinion\r\n\r\nand weighing its pros and cons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is Government's intention to commit the Bill\r\n\r\nto  a  Select Committee, and at the appropriate time  I\r\n\r\nshall  beg  leave to move the motion.  I  have  already\r\n\r\ngiven notice of two minor amendments in clauses 11  and\r\n\r\n17 which will be made in Committee, but there is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhowever,  one  other amendment which  Government  will\r\n\r\nintroduce  at  the Committee stage in connection  with\r\n\r\nclause  18  of  the Bill, making the  new  clause  73c\r\n\r\nsubsections  (1)  and  (2) of the Principal  Ordinance\r\n\r\nseizable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.54 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nintroduction of this Bill marks a great change in  the\r\n\r\nelection system of this country. In the past  we  have\r\n\r\nhad  elections of a nature where people or  supporters\r\n\r\nof the candidates crowded around the polling stations.\r\n\r\nThis Bill will also give a chance to those who wish to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstand   for  election  but  who  cannot  afford  heavy\r\n\r\nexpenses.  Also  with the introduction  of  this  Bill\r\n\r\nthere  will  be no more allegations of secret  society\r\n\r\nactivities on election day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that this Bill is framed in two parts. One part, according to the explanatory\r\n\r\nstatement, is that this Bill is designed primarily  to\r\n\r\namend  the Local Government Elections Ordinance, 1957,\r\n\r\nin  order to implement certain recommendations of  the\r\n\r\nReport  of  the  Commission of Inquiry  into  Corrupt,\r\n\r\nIllegal  or  Undesirable Practices at  Elections.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  part  is  \"Another change is  the  removal  of\r\n\r\nmandatory   nature   of   provisions   requiring   the\r\n\r\npublication   in   newspapers  of   various   election\r\n\r\nnotices.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to clauses 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9, they\r\n\r\nseek  to  do  away with advertisements  in  any  local\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  This, I understand, is for the purpose  of\r\n\r\neconomy. The Minister, when introducing this Bill, has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  in  the past the Government  has  entailed\r\n\r\nheavy  advertisement costs. If this Bill becomes  law,\r\n\r\nSir,  then the notices will only appear in the Gazette\r\n\r\nand  not in the local newspapers. May I know from  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  Sir, how many people in Singapore  actually\r\n\r\nread  the Gazette or subscribe to the Gazette?  Except\r\n\r\nfor  Government departments and a few big firms  which\r\n\r\nactually  subscribe to the Gazette, I  am  quite  sure\r\n\r\nthat  many  people will be deprived of the opportunity\r\n\r\nto know about\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  notices  of  elections. A large majority  of  the\r\n\r\npublic do not even know where to get the Gazette. Then\r\n\r\nhow  can they be aware of notices of elections? If the\r\n\r\npresent practice is discontinued, Sir, the public will\r\n\r\nbe deprived of the opportunity of claiming their names\r\n\r\non  the  electoral registers if their names have  been\r\n\r\nomitted. It will also deprive those who would like  to\r\n\r\nobject  to some names that appear on the registers  of\r\n\r\nan  opportunity to do so. According to the Budget, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  spends huge sums of money every  year.  By\r\n\r\ndoing   away   with  advertisements   in   the   local\r\n\r\nnewspapers, the saving effected is very small, and  if\r\n\r\nthe Government thinks that it is essential, then it is\r\n\r\npenny  wise and pound foolish. For the benefit of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public, Sir, I still say that  advertisements\r\n\r\nshould  appear  in the newspapers and they  should  be\r\n\r\nwidely publicised. Instead of the term as contained in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill - \"in one or more newspapers\" - I would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  it  should  be amended to read \"in  all  leading\r\n\r\nEnglish and vernacular daily newspapers\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the implementation of the recommendations\r\n\r\nmade by the Elias Commission, it is surprising to note\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is only taking into consideration\r\n\r\ncertain     recommendations.    Why    only    certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations?  When  the  Elias  Commission  framed\r\n\r\ntheir  recommendations, they took the whole aspect  of\r\n\r\nthe  election machinery into consideration and  not  a\r\n\r\npart  of it. For instance, Sir, clause 16 of the  Bill\r\n\r\nis a new provision by adding section 66A after section\r\n\r\n66  of the principal Ordinance. This section prohibits\r\n\r\nthe use of motor vehicles on election day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 of the Bill seeks to prohibit canvassing\r\n\r\non  polling  day. I take it this is to prevent  secret\r\n\r\nsociety activities on election day. I agree that these\r\n\r\nrecommendations or amendments are good, but  can  they\r\n\r\nbe  considered adequate? The framing of this Bill will\r\n\r\nonly  allow  a certain section of the public  to  take\r\n\r\npart  in  election activities - may I say,  professional\r\n\r\npoliticians only?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has said that our experience of\r\n\r\nelections goes back to 1948 - 10 years ago. We  should\r\n\r\nbe  considered an advanced country where elections are\r\n\r\nconcerned. But there are still people in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  do  not  want  to  be  dragged  into  a\r\n\r\npolitical  warfare. Normally a friend  of  a  candidate\r\n\r\nwill  willingly offer his car or his assistance  during\r\n\r\nan  election campaign; but if this Bill is passed, then\r\n\r\nsuch  an  offer  of  a  car or assistance  will  be  an\r\n\r\noffence. According to clause 18, that friend will  have\r\n\r\nto  be registered before he can help a candidate during\r\n\r\nelection day or during the election campaign. This is a\r\n\r\nmost  cumbersome  procedure, Sir. As  supporters  of  a\r\n\r\ncandidate  will  now  be subject to  screening  by  the\r\n\r\npolice  if  they offer their assistance to him,  it  is\r\n\r\nthen  up  to  the  police to say  whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nsupporters  can  take  part in the  election  campaign.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,    people   with   a   high    sense    of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility - and   therefore   good    citizens    of\r\n\r\nSingapore - will no longer discuss openly the good or bad\r\n\r\npoints of a candidate of a certain political Party. The\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the new sections 73A, 73B and 73C  in\r\n\r\nclause 18 may only be a technical point in the eyes  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  but the man in the  street  does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand what the legislation is and he does not wish\r\n\r\nto  be  involved in any political complications because\r\n\r\nhe  is  afraid  of  committing an offence  under  these\r\n\r\nsections  in  clause 18. There would then be  very  few\r\n\r\npeople  who would be prepared to come forward to assist\r\n\r\na  candidate during his election campaign. So when this\r\n\r\nBill becomes law, it will mean that voters will have to\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  polls  voluntarily  either  in  their  own\r\n\r\ntransport, if they have it, or, if they have not,  walk\r\n\r\nthere.  It is encouraging to note that the Minister  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to have more polling stations, especially  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas, so that people will have only a  very\r\n\r\nshort distance to walk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, the amendments appear to be good\r\n\r\nand  I  am sure every Member in this House will support\r\n\r\nthem, having regard to the recent Kallang by-election.\r\n\r\nBut  does  the  Government visualise the percentage  of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvoters who will go to the polls? Every voter will  have\r\n\r\nto  make up his own mind voluntarily that he should  go\r\n\r\nto  the  polls and exercise his right to vote. I recall\r\n\r\nto  this  House, Sir, what happened at the Kallang  by-election. The Government claimed to have a record  poll\r\n\r\nat this by-election, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  was  only slightly above 50 per cent. The political\r\n\r\nParties  and  their  candidates  took  great  pains  to\r\n\r\npersuade people to go to the polls. Had it not been for\r\n\r\nthis.  I  am sure the percentage of voters at this  by-election would have been much lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also give credit to the Department of\r\n\r\nInformation Services during the Kallang by-election.  A\r\n\r\nvan  toured the division every evening with neon lights\r\n\r\nappealing to the people to go to the polls and  telling\r\n\r\nthem that they must exercise their franchise right. Yet\r\n\r\nin spite of all this, only slightly over 50 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  voters,  as I have said, voted. Without  all  this\r\n\r\nwork  by the Government, the percentage might have been\r\n\r\n20 or 30 per cent only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this Bill, Sir, there will\r\n\r\nbe  no more cars roaming about the streets with badges,\r\n\r\nposters or symbols. There will be no more canvassing by\r\n\r\nsupporters  and,  what  is  more  important,  no   more\r\n\r\nannoyance  will be caused to the voters  by  supporters\r\n\r\ncoming to their doors every half-hour or 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Government wants to implement the Elias\r\n\r\nCommission's recommendations, why not take all of  them\r\n\r\ninto  consideration rather than some of them? I am glad\r\n\r\nthat the Government is prepared to refer this Bill to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee. If it were not prepared to do  so,  I\r\n\r\nwould have done it. My reason for wishing this Bill  to\r\n\r\ngo  to  a  Select Committee is so that more  amendments\r\n\r\ncould   be  introduced  to  implement  adequately   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the  Elias  Commission.   At   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  stage  I  hope  the  Government  will   also\r\n\r\nconsider the point I have raised - that advertisements of\r\n\r\nnotices  of  election should appear in all English  and\r\n\r\nvernacular daily newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I felt dismayed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter having listened to the mover of this motion,  but\r\n\r\nafter  hearing  the flow of words from the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, I have forgotten my dismay. Sir, the  pious\r\n\r\nand sanctimonious incantation of democracy, in order to\r\n\r\nrig  election  laws for the benefit of those  who  hope\r\n\r\nthat they will win the next election, leaves me aghast.\r\n\r\nWe are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntold that the whole purpose of these amendments to  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance is to have clean and honest elections so that\r\n\r\nclean and honest men would be elected to this Assembly,\r\n\r\nand  that  they have done no more than just adopt  what\r\n\r\nthe Elias Commission recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, Sir, the recommendations that\r\n\r\nwere    made   were   inter-related.   One    of    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  said, \"Polling day a public  holiday\".\r\n\r\nAnother  said  compulsory voting, no  canvassing.  Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neverybody knows that a public holiday will increase the\r\n\r\nvotes  of  the  candidate who has the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nworking  class. Everybody knows that at every  election\r\n\r\nthe  workers  jam the polling booths between  half-past\r\n\r\nsix   and   eight  p.m.  Therefore  we   welcomed   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to make polling day a  public  holiday.\r\n\r\nThat is part of the recommendation of the Report, but I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  sorry to see that the Labour Front, which professes\r\n\r\nto  be a Labour party and therefore should hope to  get\r\n\r\nthe  support of the working class, has decided  not  to\r\n\r\nmake  polling day a public holiday, although it is part\r\n\r\nof the recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were told that the Government is considering the\r\n\r\nquestion  of compulsory voting. Let us be honest  about\r\n\r\nit. Let us not be hypocritical. For about two months we\r\n\r\nwere reading in the newspapers every day about the  hue\r\n\r\nand  cry from the Chief Minister being actively opposed\r\n\r\nby  his  Deputy  Chief  Minister,  both  of  whom  were\r\n\r\nactively  opposed  by the ex-Chief Minister,  and  they\r\n\r\nwere  all running around in excited circles. We took  a\r\n\r\ncompletely  disinterested and  dispassionate  view  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Come  what may, we will still win, whether  you\r\n\r\nhave  compulsory  voting or not.\" Everybody  now  knows\r\n\r\nthat compulsory voting is off, because the Deputy Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  believes that if there is compulsory  voting,\r\n\r\nthere will be very few areas where U.M.N.O. supporters\r\n\r\nand  the  Malays  will  outnumber  everybody  else  and\r\n\r\ntherefore win. Therefore he is anti-compulsory  voting.\r\n\r\nAnd  therefore  the Chief Minister is in  a  bit  of  a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficulty,  because he may be left without  sufficient\r\n\r\nMembers  to form a government. All this in the name  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recommendation not to have canvassing on\r\n\r\npolling day is tied up with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting. If you have compulsory voting,  then\r\n\r\nit  is  unnecessary to canvass. But, of course, because\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  expect  to be able  to  bear  again  the\r\n\r\nenormous expenditure of men, money and materials  which\r\n\r\nwas  put  in  at  Kallang, it is  better  not  to  have\r\n\r\ncanvassing on polling day. It is a very expensive and a\r\n\r\nvery exhausting process. Particularly if one could also\r\n\r\nthroughout the whole election, block all those under 21 - presumably the governing Parties do not expect to  get\r\n\r\nanybody  under 21 to work for them. They do not  expect\r\n\r\nto be able to muster sufficient people to canvass votes\r\n\r\nfor  them - therefore nobody under 21 should  participate\r\n\r\nin  election  activities. Therefore  no  canvassing  on\r\n\r\npolling  day.  But no compulsory voting,  because  that\r\n\r\nwould  work  adversely  against the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nruling Parties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this Bill was first published, I informed\r\n\r\none  of my Branch Committee members that it is intended\r\n\r\nthat  in  future  nobody under 21 could participate  in\r\n\r\nelection  activities. He said to me, \"How can that  be?\r\n\r\nPeople over the age of 18 are asked to take a gun to do\r\n\r\nnational  service in defence of Queen and country, and\r\n\r\nyou say they cannot participate in election activities?\r\n\r\nThey  are  prepared to send them to the  front-line  in\r\n\r\norder  that they may be shot, to defend politicians  as\r\n\r\ntheir  institutions,  but  they  are  not  allowed   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in election activities?\" Further,  is  this\r\n\r\n21-year  limit  recommended in the  Elias  Report?  Who\r\n\r\nthought it out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the screening of election workers, it\r\n\r\nis  a  good and reasonable suggestion. Anybody  with  a\r\n\r\nsecret  society  record, with a card  in  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nRecords  Office - and this Office keeps a card  of  those\r\n\r\nsuspected  of  being  secret  society  gangsters,  with\r\n\r\npictures  and ten thumb-prints - should be debarred.  But\r\n\r\nclause 18, section 73C (4) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A candidate or election agent shall if so required by\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner of Police withdraw and deliver to the\r\n\r\nReturning Officer the written authority given by him to\r\n\r\nany  person who is stated by the Commissioner of Police\r\n\r\nto  be  a  person in respect of whom an order has  been\r\n\r\nmade  under  subsection  (4)  of  section  22  of   the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Ordinance  for  the  photograph  and  finger\r\n\r\nimpressions of such person to be taken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  we  saw - and  this is about 17 days  ago - Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters running around with gangsters in Kallang  and\r\n\r\nhere  we have this pious provision to say that it shall\r\n\r\nall  be illegal. We are asked to accept with equanimity\r\n\r\nand calm the suggestion that the Commissioner of Police\r\n\r\ncan  just say no to any election worker, when  we  know\r\n\r\nthat the 24 Gang was all massed on behalf of the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  at Kallang! Sir, first of all, in principle,  we\r\n\r\nobject to this procedure of registering, because it  is\r\n\r\nan  infringement of the democratic rights. If I  choose\r\n\r\nto  canvass for a person, if I speak to another  friend\r\n\r\nand  say,  \"Vote for that person\", that is an  election\r\n\r\nactivity.  And you cannot curb that. The definition  of\r\n\r\n\"election  activity\" in section 73C (5)  of  clause  18\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the purposes of this section \"election activity\"\r\n\r\nincludes any activity which is done for the purpose  of\r\n\r\npromoting  or procuring the election of a candidate  at\r\n\r\nany  election other than clerical work wholly performed\r\n\r\nwithin enclosed premises.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  visit friend X in Rayman Avenue and ask him to  vote\r\n\r\nfor  the  P.A.P.,  because it is an  honest  and  clean\r\n\r\nParty, and do not vote for the Labour Front, because  I\r\n\r\nthink they do not know where they are going anyway, and\r\n\r\nbecause they are going to dissolve themselves. And I am\r\n\r\ncommitting an offence. What is the purpose of all this?\r\n\r\nHas  the Government seriously considered the effect  of\r\n\r\nsection  73C  (5)? On principle, we object  to  it.  In\r\n\r\npractice, we say that what is going to happen  is  that\r\n\r\nall the gangsters will be allowed to have the authority\r\n\r\nto  help  certain Parties, and all the good and  honest\r\n\r\nmen  may  be suspected of being gangsters because  they\r\n\r\nare going to help the Opposition Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee to which this Bill is going\r\n\r\nto  be  committed, we will have certain  amendments  to\r\n\r\nmake  as  to,  firstly, the feasibility of  introducing\r\n\r\nthis  scheme;  secondly, if it is to be introduced  for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of eliminating secret society gangsters - and\r\n\r\nif  that is the manifest and specific intention of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  no  other - then  we  can  work  out   a\r\n\r\nprovision whereby secret\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety gangsters, although suspected to be members  of\r\n\r\nsuch  gangs  by  the  Registrar of  Societies,  can  be\r\n\r\neliminated   altogether.  But  there   should   be   no\r\n\r\ninfringement  on  the  right of a  private  citizen  to\r\n\r\ncanvass,  to  denounce, or to bring about a  change  in\r\n\r\ngovernment by bringing about the non-election of any of\r\n\r\nthe  candidates  of a party that he  dislikes.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  such powers cannot be vested in the Commissioner\r\n\r\nof Police. They must be subject to a judicial authority\r\n\r\nreviewing his actions and either approving or  negating\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of transport. It is true that we\r\n\r\nsuggested  two  years  ago  that  there  should  be   a\r\n\r\nrestriction on the use of cars. Because the  Government\r\n\r\nParties  and the Liberal-Socialists then believed  that\r\n\r\nas  they  could muster more cars they could  have  more\r\n\r\nadvantage   out  of  this  factor,  our  proposal   was\r\n\r\nrejected.  The consequent result is that every  polling\r\n\r\nday  sees  a motorcade in every constituency.  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nKallang  I  do not imagine there were less  than  1,000\r\n\r\ncars  milling  around a very small area.  According  to\r\n\r\nresults, not more than 8,000 people went to the  polls.\r\n\r\nAccording  to our analysis, at each polling station  no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  than 4,000 voters were carried there in cars.  In\r\n\r\nother words, 4,000 people went by themselves and voted.\r\n\r\nIn  case the Labour Front are wondering how they  lost,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlet  me tell them that the people walked there, slipped\r\n\r\nthrough  the  polling station gates and  voted  against\r\n\r\nthem,  despite all the high pressure tactics  of  using\r\n\r\ncars and gangsters. We think clause 16 - an amendment  to\r\n\r\nadd section 66A (2) - is inadequate. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Nothing in this section shall prevent any person\r\n\r\nemploying  a motor vehicle for the purpose of conveying\r\n\r\nto  or from the poll himself or any member of the  same\r\n\r\nhousehold or borrowing a motor vehicle from a member of\r\n\r\nthe same household to be employed for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the English law on this point has been tested\r\n\r\nfor quite a long time, and it says that nobody can give\r\n\r\nanybody a lift, be he a member of the same household or\r\n\r\notherwise. If we allow this to go in, then we will have\r\n\r\na  lot  of  cars  running around, or  which  have  been\r\n\r\nborrowed, by members of the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousehold. It may well be that the provision of  public\r\n\r\ntransport   along  some  of  the  main   roads   in   a\r\n\r\nconstituency   could   be  a  solution   to   all   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties over transport. In the rural areas - let  us\r\n\r\nface  the  facts - the position is, of course,  difficult\r\n\r\nunless  one puts up many more polling booths  than  are\r\n\r\ncontemplated  at  present.  The  difficulty  could   be\r\n\r\novercome  by  providing  public  transport  along  main\r\n\r\nroads,  but there is then the administrative difficulty\r\n\r\nof  seeing  that  such transport is  confined  only  to\r\n\r\nvoters for the purpose of going to and from the polling\r\n\r\nstations.  But  if we are to ban transport  altogether,\r\n\r\nthen  it  must be an effective and conclusive  ban.  It\r\n\r\ncannot  be one with a loophole which allows for members\r\n\r\nof  a  household.  \"Members of a  household\"  can  mean\r\n\r\nanything - because  you can have  a  house  which  has  a\r\n\r\nhundred  persons living in it, and they are all members\r\n\r\nof the same household.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I have this to add to my strictures on\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of  the Government in  this  Bill.  Clean\r\n\r\nelections  can  only  be  brought  about  if  the  main\r\n\r\npolitical   Parties  are  clean.   I   will   give   an\r\n\r\nillustration of this. The days of the Independents  are\r\n\r\nover and those who have not got a Party had better look\r\n\r\naround  quickly for one. When one Party adopts  tactics\r\n\r\nwhich  do  not  abide by the Queensbury  Rules,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  the  other Party must either  counter  them  or\r\n\r\nsuccumb.  For instance, if one Party puts  up  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of people outside the polling station  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Morale, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Gentle persuasion, albeit bordering on\r\n\r\nintimidation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>the  other  Party  is compelled to  do  likewise.  When\r\n\r\ntherefore, for the purposes of avoiding an incident  in\r\n\r\nthe   Kallang  by-election,  we  invited  all   Parties\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  to agree not to have canvassing  within  a\r\n\r\nhundred  yards of any polling station, great reluctance\r\n\r\nwas shown from the Labour Front. The ex-Chief Minister,\r\n\r\nfor  his own selfish motives, because his Workers Party\r\n\r\nprobably had nobody to put outside the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolling  stations - I think he has only got a gang  named\r\n\r\n304  now - cornered his successor in a public  interview,\r\n\r\ninto agreeing to this, and yet, despite that agreement,\r\n\r\nthe  following day at Rayman School up to half-past one\r\n\r\nwe saw masses -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Of P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - of young men wearing Labour Front\r\n\r\nbadges, Hawaiian shirts and drainpipe trousers - we have\r\n\r\npictures  to prove it too - and because it could  not  be\r\n\r\nstopped,  at  2 o'clock we gave orders to our  workers.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  have  workers who are bigger chaps,  strapping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople,   man  for  man,  S.T.C. bus  conductors   and\r\n\r\ndrivers - not gangsters. The result was to neutralise the\r\n\r\nposition.  Let  them remember this:  that  every  dirty\r\n\r\ntactic and every bit of foul play can be countered by a\r\n\r\nParty  which has an organisation and has facilities  to\r\n\r\nback  the  resources of large masses of people  in  the\r\n\r\nunions.  If  you  have that, then you  have  much  more\r\n\r\nresources  than  if  you have money to  buy  gangsters,\r\n\r\nbecause,  after all, a man who is paid to do a  job  is\r\n\r\nnot  going to exert himself more than what is necessary\r\n\r\nto  earn  the money. But if a man comes into the  field\r\n\r\nbecause  he  feels it to be his duty,  and  because  he\r\n\r\nwants  to  return a favour done for him and his  union,\r\n\r\nthen he is going to go out and do his level best to see\r\n\r\nthat  his side wins. If the Government really wants  to\r\n\r\nsee  a clean election, then, first of all, let us  have\r\n\r\nclean  and  fair play during the whole  course  of  the\r\n\r\nelection. Let us discuss these amendments not with  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of trying to cripple another Party,  but  with\r\n\r\nthe   purpose  of  getting  the  gangsters  and   other\r\n\r\nundesirable elements out of it. But so long as  we  see\r\n\r\nin  this  Bill an intention to take some advantage  and\r\n\r\ncripple the other side, we shall fight it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think this is an appropriate time to\r\n\r\nsuspend.

Members will need a little reminder from  me  of\r\n\r\nthe  current situation in regard to the enforcement  of\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order  in Singapore due to the activities  of\r\n\r\nsecret   societies.  Every  day  they  pick  up   their\r\n\r\nnewspapers  and  read of gang fights  or  other  crimes\r\n\r\ncommitted by members of these gangs in pursuit of their\r\n\r\nobject  of terrorising the law-abiding people  in  this\r\n\r\nisland.  Moreover, there has of recent weeks,  as  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers will be aware, a serious increase in this  form\r\n\r\nof  crime owing to two groups of these societies having\r\n\r\ncome into violent conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only the culmination of a steady increase in\r\n\r\ngangsterism over a period of time and which has led  to\r\n\r\nthe  adoption of a number of measures with the approval\r\n\r\nof this House which it was hoped would have enabled the\r\n\r\npolice  to reassert the authority of the law and  bring\r\n\r\nthe  criminals to justice or at least to restrict their\r\n\r\nactivities.  I  should  like to  give  the  House  some\r\n\r\nstatistics to show not only the steady increase in this\r\n\r\nform  of  crime which has been going on for some  time,\r\n\r\nbut  also  the  serious deterioration which  has  taken\r\n\r\nplace  recently. In 1954, there were 30 secret  society\r\n\r\ngang  fights;  in 1955, there were 24; in  1956,  there\r\n\r\nwere 25; in 1957, there were 150; and in the first  six\r\n\r\nmonths of this year, there were 157 - double the rate for\r\n\r\nlast year. Even allowing for the fact that a change  of\r\n\r\nclassification  came into being last year  and  certain\r\n\r\nminor  fights  which had previously been classified  as\r\n\r\naffrays  are  now brought into the category  of  secret\r\n\r\nsociety gang fights, hon. Members will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee  that  there has been a very serious rise  in  this\r\n\r\ntype Of crime. During the six weeks since 1st July this\r\n\r\nyear, there have been not only 51 gang fights, but also\r\n\r\nsix  murders, either committed in the course  of  these\r\n\r\nfights  or  for  reasons concerned with  membership  of\r\n\r\nthose  societies. In addition, the incidence of  house-breaking  and  thefts in 1958 has been double  that  of\r\n\r\nprevious years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first question which naturally has to be\r\n\r\nanswered  is why cannot the police, whose duty  it  is,\r\n\r\ndetect  the criminals and bring them before the  Courts\r\n\r\nto  be  dealt with under the ordinary law of the  land?\r\n\r\nHon.  Members  are,  I  know,  already  aware  of   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  with which the police are  faced,  but  I\r\n\r\nshould like to repeat them in order to explain why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  feels  it  necessary to  seek  the  special\r\n\r\npowers which are embodied in the Bill before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a crime is committed, whether it be a gang\r\n\r\nfight,   an  assault  or  a  murder,  those   who   are\r\n\r\nresponsible do not commit their crimes before the  eyes\r\n\r\nof the police so enabling the police not only to arrest\r\n\r\nthe  offenders there and then, but also to furnish eye-witness evidence to bring a charge before the Court. On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary, they take very good care to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere are no police officers present before they embark\r\n\r\non   a  crime.  The  police  consequently  only  obtain\r\n\r\nknowledge of the crime some time and, in certain cases,\r\n\r\na quite considerable time, after it has been committed.\r\n\r\nThe  perpetrators have disappeared and the only  method\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  detection  open to the police is to question  those\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public who may have been witnesses  to\r\n\r\nthe  crime  or for some other reason have knowledge  of\r\n\r\nit.  This  interrogation, coupled with  any  deductions\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be  made from any material evidence  to  be\r\n\r\nfound  at  the scene of the crime, is the only  way  of\r\n\r\nobtaining information which may lead to identifying the\r\n\r\ncriminals.  They have in addition their own  knowledge,\r\n\r\nculled  over  a period of time, of the members  of  the\r\n\r\nsecret  societies involved - who are the fighters and  so\r\n\r\non - but  that  is of little value when it comes  to  the\r\n\r\nsecond stage of the proceedings, which is to bring  the\r\n\r\naccused persons before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  Court and produce first-hand evidence to satisfy the\r\n\r\nCourt  that the persons are guilty of the offence  with\r\n\r\nwhich they are charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At both stages of this procedure - detection and\r\n\r\nprosecution - it has unfortunately to be recognised  that\r\n\r\nthey seldom receive the assistance from members of  the\r\n\r\npublic to which they are entitled and without which  it\r\n\r\nis  quite impossible for them to carry out their  task.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  is a simple one - that those concerned  are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo  frightened of reprisals from other members of  the\r\n\r\ngang  if they furnish any information which would  lead\r\n\r\nto the arrest of a member of the gang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gangs have in short succeeded in establishing a\r\n\r\nvery  widespread form of terrorism which  inhibits  the\r\n\r\nlaw-abiding  citizen  from carrying  out  his  duty  in\r\n\r\nassisting in the enforcement of the law. Even  if  they\r\n\r\nare  prepared,  as  they  sometimes  are  prepared,  to\r\n\r\nprovide  information in secret in such a way that  they\r\n\r\nare  satisfied that it will not become known that  they\r\n\r\nhave done so, nothing will induce them to stand up  and\r\n\r\ngive their evidence in open court or in the presence of\r\n\r\nthe accused persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, there is little if anything\r\n\r\nthe   police  can  do  to  detect  and  prosecute   the\r\n\r\ncriminals.  They can only exercise the  limited  powers\r\n\r\nopen  to  them in other directions - to have  members  of\r\n\r\nunlawful societies placed on record under the Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance, or, in a very limited number of cases  where\r\n\r\nthey  can  produce sufficient material to  satisfy  the\r\n\r\nCourt,  to have them bound over under the provision  in\r\n\r\nthe law to which the House assented earlier this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these measures are only palliatives and, as is\r\n\r\napparent  from  the events of the last few  weeks,  are\r\n\r\nquite   inadequate   to  stem  the   rising   tide   of\r\n\r\nlawlessness.  It  is  in these circumstances  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has decided that more drastic steps must  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  protect  the public from the  activities  of\r\n\r\nthese  gangs,  and that since, for the reasons  I  have\r\n\r\ngiven,  it  is not possible to achieve that  protection\r\n\r\nthrough  the  normal judicial processes of the  Courts,\r\n\r\nthese safeguards, which are adequate in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nordinary  times,  must, in the present abnormal  crime-wave,  be supplemented by executive action. It  is  not\r\n\r\nonly the duty of the Government to do this in discharge\r\n\r\nof  its  primary responsibility for the maintenance  of\r\n\r\npeace  and  good order, but I believe that there  is  a\r\n\r\nwide public demand that such action should be taken and\r\n\r\nthat  it  will meet with wholehearted support from  all\r\n\r\nlaw-abiding members of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers, Sir, which it is sought to take under\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  to  detain  for a limited  period  without\r\n\r\ntrial,  are designed to be used against the ringleaders\r\n\r\nof  these gangs and those who are primarily responsible\r\n\r\nfor  their activities. I would emphasise that it is not\r\n\r\nintended  to  use  these powers indiscriminately.  They\r\n\r\nwill be used selectively to break the gang organisation\r\n\r\nand to remove the leaders to a place where they can  no\r\n\r\nlonger  coerce the less vicious members of their  gangs\r\n\r\nas  well as the general public. As the House knows, one\r\n\r\nof  the worst features of the present situation is  the\r\n\r\nextent  to  which young boys have been drawn  into  the\r\n\r\ncoils  of  these organisations, in the  long  run  this\r\n\r\ntrend  can  be  countered  by measures  to  direct  the\r\n\r\nleisures  and  energies of our youths into  useful  and\r\n\r\nproductive  channels, but that is of no immediate  help\r\n\r\nand the need is for effective action now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I come, Sir, to the details of the Bill, I\r\n\r\nshould like to touch briefly on two other matters.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  is  that the necessary powers which  it  is  now\r\n\r\nsought  to take, I already exist under the Preservation\r\n\r\nof  Public Security Ordinance, but the Government  does\r\n\r\nnot think it proper that they should be invoked for the\r\n\r\npresent  purpose, firstly, because that  Ordinance  was\r\n\r\nenacted  for a different purpose and, secondly, because\r\n\r\nthe  Government considers it only proper that it should\r\n\r\nobtain the specific endorsement of the House to the use\r\n\r\nof   executive  powers  to  meet  the  current   threat\r\n\r\npresented by these criminals. \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter to which I wish to refer, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthe  life  of the parent Ordinance to which  this  Bill\r\n\r\nseeks  to make amendments. As the House is aware,  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance will lapse in two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths' time. It is the intention of the Government  to\r\n\r\nseek  the approval of the House to an extension of  the\r\n\r\nlife  of  this Ordinance at the appropriate time.  This\r\n\r\nwill  also  give  the  House a further  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nconsidering these provisions in common with  the  other\r\n\r\nprovision of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now, Sir, to the provisions of this Bill. The\r\n\r\nnew  Clause 47 empowers the Chief Secretary to make  an\r\n\r\norder  of  detention  for a period  not  exceeding  six\r\n\r\nmonths.  I  have already given the House  an  assurance\r\n\r\nthat  this power will be used selectively and only  for\r\n\r\nthe  purposes  I have mentioned. It has, however,  been\r\n\r\nrepresented to me since this Bill was drafted that  the\r\n\r\nwording of the new clause 47 is exceptionally wide, and\r\n\r\nI  do  propose  at  the  Committee  stage  to  move  an\r\n\r\namendment to this clause with the object of relating it\r\n\r\nmore  restrictively to the persons against whom  it  is\r\n\r\naimed.  The amendment which I shall be moving  to  this\r\n\r\nclause  is  to insert, after \"custody,\" in  the  fourth\r\n\r\nline  of the new clause 47, the words \"that such person\r\n\r\nhas  been  associated  with activities  of  a  criminal\r\n\r\nnature and\" that it is necessary, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powers, Sir, can be used selectively since the\r\n\r\npolice  have much information regarding the  leadership\r\n\r\nand many of the members of these gangs even though they\r\n\r\ncannot  bring that information before the  Courts.  The\r\n\r\nmaximum  period for the duration of an order is limited\r\n\r\nto  six months since it is hoped that within that  time\r\n\r\nit  will have proved possible to break the back of this\r\n\r\nproblem.  Nevertheless, it is not possible to count  on\r\n\r\nthat measure of success, and provision is made, in  new\r\n\r\nclause  50,  for  such orders to  be  extended  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor in Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clause 48 provides for every order made by\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Secretary to be referred within a period  of\r\n\r\n28  days  to  an  Advisory  Committee  for  report  and\r\n\r\nrecommendation. It is intended that the  Committee,  in\r\n\r\ndischarging  this task, should be at liberty  to  carry\r\n\r\nout the fullest enquiry, and every facility will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade  available to enable it to do so. The  report  and\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Committee are finally considered\r\n\r\nby  the Governor in Council, which has power to confirm\r\n\r\nor cancel the order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clause 49 provides for the suspension of orders\r\n\r\non  conditions. This provision, Sir, is very  desirable\r\n\r\nin  that it will facilitate releases at an earlier date\r\n\r\nthan could otherwise be justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clauses 51 and 52 provide for the appointment and\r\n\r\nfunctioning of the Advisory Committees. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  considered, Sir, whether provision should be  made\r\n\r\nfor  one  member  of  the Committee  to  have  judicial\r\n\r\nqualifications,  but  the Government  feels  that  this\r\n\r\nwould be placing an undue burden on a limited class  of\r\n\r\npersons  many  of whom are already carrying  out  other\r\n\r\npublic  duties. Nevertheless, if the House  feels  that\r\n\r\nthis  additional safeguard would be an  important  one,\r\n\r\nthe  Government would be prepared to accept a  suitable\r\n\r\namendment at the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53 is inserted to protect the sources of\r\n\r\ninformation where it is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 54 provides for the custody and movement of\r\n\r\ndetained persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 55 gives the police power to arrest and hold\r\n\r\npersons  in  custody for a limited  period,  while  any\r\n\r\nfurther necessary investigations are carried out before\r\n\r\nit is decided to apply for an order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 56 and 57 concern powers of arrest in\r\n\r\npursuance of these provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 58 should be read in conjunction with the\r\n\r\nprovision  in  clause 47, that no  order  can  be  made\r\n\r\nwithout  the consent of the Public Prosecutor.  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  given  an  assurance  that  these  powers   of\r\n\r\ndetention  will  not  be  used  indiscriminately.  This\r\n\r\nprovision is designed to ensure also that they will not\r\n\r\nbe  used  as a substitute for prosecution in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the ordinary processes of law. In any case  where\r\n\r\nit  is  possible  to bring a prosecution,  it  will  be\r\n\r\nbrought  and,  on  the  facts  presented,  the   Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor will not give his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsent  to  an order unless he is satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\nindividual concerned cannot be prosecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one further minor amendment I shall be\r\n\r\nmoving  at the Committee stage, both to clauses 57  and\r\n\r\n59. As these clauses are at present drafted, the powers\r\n\r\nconferred  under  them  are  applicable  to   all   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the main Ordinance. It is not intended or\r\n\r\ndesired  to  extend  the powers of the  police  or  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in relation to the other provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and I therefore propose to move an amendment\r\n\r\nwhich   will   have  the  effect  of  restricting   the\r\n\r\napplication of these two clauses to the new Part VII of\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance which is contained in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I should like to reiterate that it is\r\n\r\nonly  the  exceptional gravity of the present state  of\r\n\r\ngang  lawlessness which compels the Government to  seek\r\n\r\nthese   exceptional  powers  for  immediate   use.   No\r\n\r\ndemocratic government will lightly curtail the  liberty\r\n\r\nof  any  individual by executive action, nor  would  it\r\n\r\nwish  to curtail that liberty for a moment longer  than\r\n\r\nis   absolutely  necessary.  This  Government   is   no\r\n\r\nexception but when there is no other means of restoring\r\n\r\npeace  and  good order to the island, and removing  the\r\n\r\ndark  shadow of terrorism which is spreading  over  the\r\n\r\nlives of innocent citizens, then the Government has not\r\n\r\nonly  no alternative, but a positive duty to the public\r\n\r\nto  take  that action. So long as the public  fails  to\r\n\r\ngive their full co-operation in the enforcement of  the\r\n\r\nlaw, the ordinary judicial processes are stultified. So\r\n\r\nlong  as  the criminals concerned cannot be brought  to\r\n\r\njustice, the public will continue to live in fear,  and\r\n\r\nthat fear will inhibit their co-operation. This vicious\r\n\r\ncircle must be broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the slowly increasing mutual confidence between\r\n\r\nthe  police and the public following Police  Week,  and\r\n\r\nother  measures to promote that confidence,  there  are\r\n\r\nencouraging  signs,  and information  received  by  the\r\n\r\npolice  has  resulted  in the recovery  of  substantial\r\n\r\nquantities of weapons and other material\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstored  away against gang fights. But this  process  is\r\n\r\nslow  and it may well wither away if the present  level\r\n\r\nof  gang  activity is allowed to continue. It  needs  a\r\n\r\ncatalytic  agent. I believe this measure  will  provide\r\n\r\none,  and  I  sincerely hope that if we can  accelerate\r\n\r\nthis process and prevail on the public to give more and\r\n\r\nmore  assistance to the police, it would  not  be  very\r\n\r\nlong before the conditions in which these gangsters can\r\n\r\nflourish will no longer obtain, the normal processes of\r\n\r\nlaw  will  once more be adequate to detect  and  punish\r\n\r\ncrimes,  and  these  special powers can  be  thankfully\r\n\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nsecond the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  I  read  in  the  newspapers  this  morning  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  to introduce legislation  to  give  the\r\n\r\npolice more powers to wipe out gangsterism, I was  very\r\n\r\nhappy and, with a determined mind, I came here to  give\r\n\r\nfull support. When I came to this sitting this morning,\r\n\r\nI  was handed a copy of this Bill by the Hon, the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary,  but on reading through it,  I  felt  rather\r\n\r\ndisappointed and will now have to change my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am not a lawyer, while going through the\r\n\r\ncontents of the Bill it appears to me that its  wording\r\n\r\nis more or less identical with that of the Preservation\r\n\r\nof  Public Security Ordinance. Sir, any extra powers to\r\n\r\nbe  given to the police to stamp out gangsterism should\r\n\r\nbe  most welcome to the public. I am sure everyone will\r\n\r\nsupport these extra powers because gangsterism has been\r\n\r\non  the  rise recently. In fact Government should  have\r\n\r\nintroduced such powers long, long before. This Bill  is\r\n\r\nlong  overdue. And if Government had done so, I am sure\r\n\r\nit  would  have saved a few lives.

What\r\n\r\nsurprises the man in the street is this: that  although\r\n\r\nthe  police  know full well who the gangsters  are  and\r\n\r\ntheir  hideouts, no action has been taken so  far.

I have an extract  here,\r\n\r\nSir. Section 12 of the Secret Society Ordinance reads -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Societies Ordinance - section 12\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Any person who is or acts as a member of an\r\n\r\nunlawful  society, or attends a meeting of an  unlawful\r\n\r\nsociety,  shall be liable to a fine not  exceeding  one\r\n\r\nthousand  dollars, or to imprisonment for a term  which\r\n\r\nmay extend to six months, or to both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Every offence against the provisions of subsection\r\n\r\n(1) shall be deemed to be a non-bailable offence and  a\r\n\r\nseizable  case  within  the  meaning  of  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the police do have powers under this section,\r\n\r\nwhy  not  introduce legislation to amend this Ordinance\r\n\r\nrather  than  introduce amendments  in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Preservation  of  Public  Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance?

It is a departure from the principles  of\r\n\r\nnormal procedure that a man is not brought to court for\r\n\r\nopen   trial.  The  Preservation  of  Public   Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance gives powers to the police to detain  persons\r\n\r\nsuspected  of subversive activities. These  offences  I\r\n\r\ntake  to  be political, but under the Criminal  Justice\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions) Bill, powers are to be given  to\r\n\r\nthe  police to deal with criminal offences. Gangsterism\r\n\r\nis  a  criminal  offence, and  there  is  a  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  the Preservation of Public Security  Ordinance\r\n\r\nand  this  Bill  on criminal law, as explained  by  the\r\n\r\nChief Secretary in moving the Second Reading. Why then,\r\n\r\nSir,  put  the contents of the Preservation  of  Public\r\n\r\nSecurity Ordinance into this Bill dealing with criminal\r\n\r\noffences?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When subversive elements are detained, it is a matter\r\n\r\nof  political affairs and, may be for security reasons,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is not prepared to bring them to  court\r\n\r\nfor   open  trial.  But  where  criminal  offences  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  what  is there to hide?  If  a  person  has\r\n\r\ncommitted a criminal offence, let us bring him to court\r\n\r\nfor open trial and judge if he has in fact committed an\r\n\r\noffence.  Democratic  justice  must  be  given  to  the\r\n\r\naccused  and if anybody is arrested under any  criminal\r\n\r\nlaw,  he  must  be tried in open court and  the  matter\r\n\r\nshould  not be kept secret.

The whole solemnity of the judicial process,  of\r\n\r\nthe  legislative process, is gone through  to  nab  the\r\n\r\ngangsters  to bring law and order, and the police  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  gangsters are often seen in the  company  of\r\n\r\nimportant political personages. Now where are we headed\r\n\r\nfor? I say if we want to get to the bottom of this, let\r\n\r\nus  establish some morality, some standards of dos  and\r\n\r\ndon'ts,  and one of the don'ts is: don't get  mixed  up\r\n\r\nwith gangsters in public life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the powers themselves; in\r\n\r\nfact I was remarking to the Chief Secretary that he  is\r\n\r\na  little  bit  kinder  to  gangsters  than  he  is  to\r\n\r\npolitical subversives - he locks up political subversives\r\n\r\nfor two years, he is going to lock up gangsters for six\r\n\r\nmonths  at a time. But I would like to make this  extra\r\n\r\nplea to distinguish between those who are locked up for\r\n\r\nideological and other political matters, from those who\r\n\r\nare  locked  up  for more mundane and  matter  of  fact\r\n\r\nreasons  of dollars and cents, of extortion,  of  pick-pocketing,  and bashing and acid-throwing. Let  us  not\r\n\r\nhave  any distinction in the treatment they receive  in\r\n\r\nthe places to which he has the power to direct them.  I\r\n\r\nsee  that the provisions in this Bill for the detention\r\n\r\nand  the places of detention are similar to those under\r\n\r\nthe  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance. But  we\r\n\r\nshould  make  it  clear that these men  should  not  be\r\n\r\ndetained  in  the  same places or in contiguous  places\r\n\r\nwith  political  detainees. Political detainees  are  a\r\n\r\nclass  apart.  In 19501 believe there  was  a  practice\r\n\r\nsometimes of putting the gangsters with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  political subversives. The idea  originally  was\r\n\r\nthat  the gangsters would break down the morale of  the\r\n\r\npolitical subversives and then corrupt them. I was told\r\n\r\nthe  practice was subsequently dropped because some  of\r\n\r\nthe  gangsters  were  converted to more  effective  and\r\n\r\npurposeful  methods  of employing  their  energies  and\r\n\r\nspare  time.  I  hope  not only for  the  sake  of  the\r\n\r\ngangsters  and  the  conscience  of  this  House,   but\r\n\r\ngenerally for the distinction which you must keep clear\r\n\r\nin the public mind between political and other forms of\r\n\r\nsubversion,  that this is a class apart - we are  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  thugs here, we are not dealing with ideals, ideas\r\n\r\nor convictions be they right or wrong. And when we deal\r\n\r\nwith thugs, we cannot deal passively, as the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown suggested we ought to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless one should be careful that none of the\r\n\r\nallegations  which the Member for Queenstown  so  often\r\n\r\nrepeats in this Assembly ever come to life; they should\r\n\r\nnever  be  true. There should never be a  situation  in\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is  generally believed, rightly or  wrongly,\r\n\r\nthat  force  is  being used. That is a  matter  of  the\r\n\r\nutmost importance in the preservation of the morale not\r\n\r\nonly  of the police force, but the morale of the public\r\n\r\ngenerally. If it is believed that members of the police\r\n\r\nand  Secret  Societies Sub-Branch do in  fact  beat  up\r\n\r\nsecret  society  detainees, and that  belief  generally\r\n\r\nprevails throughout the whole community, then I say you\r\n\r\nhave a very ugly situation developing in which loss  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  and  public morale, and general  alarm  and\r\n\r\ndespondency  at the executive powers of the  Government\r\n\r\nwill undermine the whole basis of the democratic state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that reminder to the Government, I would say\r\n\r\nthat   any   responsible   political   Party,   however\r\n\r\ndistasteful extraordinary powers may be, must give  its\r\n\r\nsupport to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Amongst those changes, we have seen  a  large\r\n\r\nchange  in  the  makeup of the Singapore Police  Force.\r\n\r\nMany  previous officers who came from overseas to serve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin this Island have been pensioned off on very generous\r\n\r\nterms. Their places have been taken by the local boy - if\r\n\r\nI  may refer in such a lighthearted phrase to the  very\r\n\r\nhighly-trained,  highly capable  and  highly  efficient\r\n\r\nAsian police officers which we have today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe for one moment that any of those\r\n\r\nofficers  or the men under them will abuse  any  powers\r\n\r\nthat  are  granted them by this House. I feel  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes to voting, I really hope to see a unanimous  vote\r\n\r\nin favour of this Bill, which would be tantamount to  a\r\n\r\nvote  of  confidence  in our own  police  force,  which\r\n\r\npolice  force, I think I may say, if this House  cannot\r\n\r\nclaim  paternity  it  can claim  at  least  to  be  its\r\n\r\ngodfather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  the  hon.

I do not believe that they would be so rash\r\n\r\nand stupid as to do such a thing and, secondly, I did\r\n\r\nnot say that. What I did say was that usually when the\r\n\r\ntrial comes on, between the time when the case was\r\n\r\nfirst mentioned in court, in the two or three months\r\n\r\nbefore the trial, somebody, somewhere, at some place,\r\n\r\nat some time, got at some witnesses. And they are not\r\n\r\nlawyers who do this, because I do not believe, having\r\n\r\nseen the members of the Bar and the recent recruits to\r\n\r\nit, that they have the physical necessity, the\r\n\r\nrequirements, the prerequisites to instil the kind of\r\n\r\nfear which I think one secret society gangster can\r\n\r\ninstil in another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I must express my thanks for\r\n\r\nthe  explanation given by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nin  that  he admitted that there are a few people  who,\r\n\r\nsomewhere  and at some time, unscrupulously,  greedily,\r\n\r\nfix  witnesses and help gangsters to get off.  Sir,  as\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar has admitted that he is  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the Bar Committee, I wish he  would  assure\r\n\r\nthis  House that he would bring this matter to the  Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee  to  discuss  whether even  one  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nlawyer is practising such things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next comment is on the statement by the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  Mr  Mason  about  abuse  of  power  by  police\r\n\r\nofficers.  Sir, I think this point is worth considering\r\n\r\nmore. Yes, all along we respect the integrity and  high\r\n\r\nability of the police force in this country, but  as  I\r\n\r\nmentioned during the April sitting, police officers may\r\n\r\nbe  misled into misusing and abusing their powers; they\r\n\r\nmay  not do this purposely but because they are  misled\r\n\r\ninto   it.   Why? - the  C.I.D. forces  are  unreliable,\r\n\r\nuntrustworthy.  This  is  known  not   only   to   many\r\n\r\nhonourable Members of this House, but, I think, even to\r\n\r\nthe police themselves. So it is high time, Sir, for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the Chief Secretary to consider whether  the\r\n\r\npolice force should set up a new branch, say a juvenile\r\n\r\nsection, to deal with delinquents; to clean out the bad\r\n\r\nhats  among  the  plainclothes men; and immediately  to\r\n\r\nrecruit a new force of plainclothes men to build up the\r\n\r\nconfidence and trust of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support Mr Mason that this Bill should\r\n\r\nbe  supported unanimously by this House. It is not only\r\n\r\ntimely   but  already  overdue.  Anyhow,  despite   its\r\n\r\nimportance  and  timeliness, I have a few  comments.  A\r\n\r\npatient is told by a doctor he suffers from high  blood\r\n\r\npressure. From time to time he has headaches.  We  know\r\n\r\ntoo  well that he suffers from high-blood pressure. But\r\n\r\nhe only relies on Aw Boon Haw's \"Tiger Balm\". Every day\r\n\r\nhe  rubs this \"Tiger Balm\" to try a cure. Sir, that  is\r\n\r\nuseless.  Similarly,  to me this  Bill  can  only  cure\r\n\r\ntemporary headaches but not the high-blood pressure. We\r\n\r\nChinese  say, \"Yao tzu pen pu nen ke tzu piao; tzu  pen\r\n\r\npu nen ke tzu piao.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> What does that mean?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Translated - you must get to the\r\n\r\nroot  of the trouble.

This is most  important.\r\n\r\nAs  long as any politician belonging to any Party tries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  seek  support  from gangsters, the  gangsters  will\r\n\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we talk about the unemployment problem. I think\r\n\r\nnow  is  the  right time for the Hon, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Welfare to give us an exact figure  of  the\r\n\r\nunemployed in Singapore. Many a time when I  asked  him\r\n\r\nplease  to  quote  the figure of unemployment  in  this\r\n\r\nColony,  he  mentioned only a few  thousand  registered\r\n\r\nunemployed  at the Labour Exchange.

It is useless, Sir. The problem of gangsters  is\r\n\r\nnot  only  a  social one but, to me,  an  economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical one as well. Simply by empowering the  police\r\n\r\nto  have the vital right to make arrests and detention,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot expect the gangster problem to die. To  me,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  fundamental problem will still  remain,  not\r\n\r\nsolved.  Give us the real figure of how many unemployed\r\n\r\nthere  are in this Colony, including hawkers, for  many\r\n\r\nof them are also unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Commerce and Industry made\r\n\r\na  very  timely and constructive statement this morning\r\n\r\nbut  we  know that, despite his hard work and sincerity\r\n\r\nto  try  to  improve industrialisation and promote  the\r\n\r\nentrepot trade, his hands are tied, and that even  time\r\n\r\nis  against him. How to promote industrialisation  when\r\n\r\neven  at  the Causeway the tariffs are so high  against\r\n\r\nhim? As for the entrepot trade, does the Indonesian and\r\n\r\nChinese trade improve or decline?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my conclusion I wish to make a point. This\r\n\r\nBill  is introduced by an expatriate officer, the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Secretary, to meet the problem of gangsters,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  if  Whitehall in London insists  on  dividing  our\r\n\r\npeople into the Bornean, Singaporeans and Malayans, the\r\n\r\nthree  territories will forever not be  able  to  enjoy\r\n\r\neither economic or political stability, and as long  as\r\n\r\nthere    is   economic   and   political   instability,\r\n\r\ngangsterism can never die. Sir, I think it is high time\r\n\r\nfor  Whitehall to consider. Do not divide us. Let these\r\n\r\nthree territories become one. We cry about unemployment\r\n\r\nin  this Colony, yet North Borneo makes an announcement\r\n\r\ninviting  Hongkong farmers and workers to open  up  its\r\n\r\nterritory. Sir, of course you are going to rule me  out\r\n\r\nas being irrelevant, but it is the only remedy to solve\r\n\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon.

This Bill curbs to a certain extent the\r\n\r\nliberties of the people of Singapore and certain\r\n\r\nclauses make me almost feel that I should oppose this\r\n\r\nBill, particularly clause 55 which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...if an officer of or above the rank of\r\n\r\nSuperintendent   of  Police  is  satisfied   that   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  enquiries  cannot be  completed  within  the\r\n\r\naforesaid  period of forty-eight hours he may authorise\r\n\r\nthe  further detention of such person for an additional\r\n\r\nperiod not exceeding fourteen days...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  indeed  is a very wide power given  to  a  Police\r\n\r\nOfficer  but  the manner in which the  Hon, the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary delivered his speech this afternoon stressing\r\n\r\nupon  the  gravity of the situation that  confronts  us\r\n\r\ntoday,  quoting  us figures showing  the  incidence  of\r\n\r\ncrime,  murders, burglaries and thefts  connected  with\r\n\r\ngangsterism,  then I must say that my mind  is  changed\r\n\r\nand  I have no hesitation in supporting this Bill  this\r\n\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad indeed that he has assured us that the\r\n\r\npurpose  of this Bill is to get at the leaders and  not\r\n\r\nat  the small men because it is the leaders who must be\r\n\r\ndetained   and  I  hope  that  all  efforts   will   be\r\n\r\nconcentrated on them so that the smaller fry will  then\r\n\r\nbe  given  a  chance  to know that Government  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  of Singapore are prepared to resort to  extreme\r\n\r\nmeasures to make this place suitable for us to live in.\r\n\r\nI  am  glad also to note that in two months' time,  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparent  Ordinance, that is the Criminal Law  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Ordinance, will come up again before  this\r\n\r\nAssembly for us to approve or to deny its extension. By\r\n\r\nthat  time I hope a full statement will be made  to  us\r\n\r\nand we shall be able to judge whether the provisions of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  which  gives so much power  to  the  Police\r\n\r\nshould be extended or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to me\r\n\r\nthat  the newspapers during the last week have  focused\r\n\r\ntheir attention on gangsterism which made us feel  that\r\n\r\ngangsterism is a new problem that has just cropped  up;\r\n\r\nbut  I would like to remind this House that gangsterism\r\n\r\nhas existed for a very long time. Since the founding of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there has been gangsterism. All along,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has had in its armory many types of laws  to\r\n\r\ncurb  this undesirable activity. All along, it has  had\r\n\r\nplenty  of time and money that it could spend  usefully\r\n\r\nto  prevent  an occurrence of this type of  gangsterism\r\n\r\nand yet today we find that the Government comes to this\r\n\r\nHouse  to  ask for extraordinary powers. I do  not  say\r\n\r\nthat  that is wrong but I would say that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  been caught on the wrong foot and that we must now\r\n\r\nsupport Government in this measure in order to bring to\r\n\r\nSingapore  the  peace  that  we  enjoyed  before.  This\r\n\r\nproblem of gangsterism, I believe, is not due to people\r\n\r\njust wanting to become gangsters at once but there  are\r\n\r\na  lot  of contributory causes. Many of the Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  have rightly pointed out that one  of  the\r\n\r\ncauses    is   unemployment.   I   agree   with    them\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly. I agree that due to the  present  trend\r\n\r\nof  events,  many people are afraid of operating  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses  here. They are chased away by the  uttering\r\n\r\nof  very  irresponsible politicians.  They  close  down\r\n\r\nfactories;  they refuse to expand their businesses  and\r\n\r\nthey  refuse to start new businesses. This, of  course,\r\n\r\nhas  increased  unemployment on a  greater  scale  than\r\n\r\never. If this situation is not rectified soon enough, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the law will have to be prolonged  for  a\r\n\r\nlonger period than necessary. The Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry has come out with a little plan.  I  wish\r\n\r\nhis  plan  success  but it will  only  succeed  if  all\r\n\r\npoliticians will be less irresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, gangsterism is not merely due to\r\n\r\nunemployment.  There  are  so  many  young  people   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  have not been given the education  they\r\n\r\ndeserved.  They have been turned out on to the  streets\r\n\r\nat an early age - an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nage too young for employment and with knowledge far too\r\n\r\nmeagre  to be wanted. Something must be done to  bridge\r\n\r\nthis  gap  and  although  the Government,  through  the\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department, is doing what it can, yet I  think\r\n\r\nit  has  not  done  enough.  More  assistance  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection will help Singapore on its way to get rid  of\r\n\r\nthis  menace. If money is not spent to help our  youths\r\n\r\nto  occupy their time usefully to learn a trade or  get\r\n\r\nthemselves   into  organisations  and  help  themselves\r\n\r\nusefully  until such time when they are of an age  that\r\n\r\nwould  be acceptable for employment, then we will  have\r\n\r\nto  spend  more  money  on other departments  like  the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  the Prisons Departments. I  know  we  have\r\n\r\nthese troubles all these years; when every time a  vote\r\n\r\ncomes   before   the  Hon. the  Financial   Secretary,\r\n\r\ninvariably he cuts out or reduces the assistance  given\r\n\r\nto these youths by the Welfare Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I have read about the utterings of many\r\n\r\nimportant  people  in Singapore on gangsterism  in  the\r\n\r\npapers  during the whole of last week. Everybody  said,\r\n\r\n\"It  is  a terrible thing. We must curb it. We must  do\r\n\r\nsomething about it.\" But I notice one thing. All  these\r\n\r\nprominent  people will only shout their heads  off  but\r\n\r\nwill not do anything that is useful to help correct the\r\n\r\nsituation!  I  wish the people of Singapore  would  not\r\n\r\njust   shout  but  would  come  out  to  help  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.  Politicians should  not  just  condemn  one\r\n\r\nthing  or  another  but should come  out  to  work  and\r\n\r\ncontribute  something towards the  well-being  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  We have today a situation whereby gangsterism\r\n\r\nis  slowly  taking over the powers of the  Police.  The\r\n\r\npeople  are more afraid of gangsters than they  are  of\r\n\r\nthe  Police.  The gangsters, as the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) said, know the law by  heart.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  do a few things to improve the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was the \"Police Week\" that was staged not so very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong  ago. I visited a number of police stations and  I\r\n\r\nwas amazed by the courtesy shown by them. I was glad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  see the change of heart of the policemen. They were\r\n\r\nall  ready to serve but they were only ready  to  serve\r\n\r\nduring  Police Week! Once the Police Week was  switched\r\n\r\noff their readiness for cooperation also dimmed. I hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police Week staged not so long ago  will  be\r\n\r\nstaged  365  days  a year. The courtesy  shown  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  should be shown every day of the year.  If  the\r\n\r\npeople know that they can run to the Police every  time\r\n\r\nthey   are  in  trouble,  for  protection,  they   will\r\n\r\ninvariably choose the path which is lawful. But if they\r\n\r\nknow  that  running  to  the Police  means  endangering\r\n\r\nthemselves  or  their opinions falling on unsympathetic\r\n\r\nears, then gangsterism will be on the rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard what the Member for Tanjong Pagar said about\r\n\r\ngangsters;  how they know the law, how they  know  that\r\n\r\nthey  can be detained for 24 hours and later on brought\r\n\r\nbefore a Court to be charged, get themselves bailed and\r\n\r\nthen  come  up before the Court again in a few  months'\r\n\r\ntime  for the case to be heard. But he missed  out  one\r\n\r\nvery  important  thing and that  is,  usually  at  such\r\n\r\nhearings,  there  will be a willing  lawyer  to  defend\r\n\r\nthem. As a member of the Bar Committee, I wish he could\r\n\r\nbring  this  matter up before their attention  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  should not only count the dollars and cents  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  rake in, but should also consider the  moral\r\n\r\nbehind a case and see whether it should be defended  or\r\n\r\nnot.  If  there is cooperation again in this direction,\r\n\r\nthen  we  will not have too many of these gangsters  or\r\n\r\nmurderers  getting  free!  I  think  that  is  a   very\r\n\r\nimportant  point  for the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  to\r\n\r\npress home. Today, before us we have this law, a law to\r\n\r\ncurtail the liberty of the individual. We know that  it\r\n\r\nis  impossible not to have this law; this  law  is  not\r\n\r\nwelcome  if it is considered in the light of democracy.\r\n\r\nBut we say we support this Bill reluctantly and we like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  see this Bill repealed as soon as it has served its\r\n\r\nusefulness. I hope that the period for this  Bill  will\r\n\r\nbe  about  a  year or less. After that,  it  should  be\r\n\r\nrescinded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We love our ways of life.

As soon as we have the upper hand, then we should\r\n\r\nwant   to  reclaim  our  liberty.  I  recall  one  very\r\n\r\ninteresting statement in a paper last week. There was a\r\n\r\nvery  prominent visitor to Singapore in the  person  of\r\n\r\nMr  Ogata who was the Police Commissioner here  during\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese occupation. He told us, \"During my  time,\r\n\r\nSingapore  was all peaceful. You could sleep with  open\r\n\r\ndoors.  There were no gangsters. It was just peaceful.\"\r\n\r\nBut  I  would  like Mr Ogata to know that  we  do  not\r\n\r\nrelish that type of a peace. We lived in fear. We  lost\r\n\r\nall  our  personal liberties. We resented  their  being\r\n\r\nhere.  We  resented  their method of arresting  anybody\r\n\r\nthey liked and of administering the law in the way they\r\n\r\ndid.  We have never welcomed them; we have never  loved\r\n\r\nthem; we have not forgotten them and we will not forget\r\n\r\nthem!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M.

There  is  no\r\n\r\nneed   to   hide  behind  the  bush  and  to  talk   of\r\n\r\n\"democracy\", the \"freedom of the person\",  \"the  rights\r\n\r\nof  the  citizen\" and \"liberties\". What  price  liberty\r\n\r\nnext  year  when  a backseat driver of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar might be Prime Minister? Have  you  ever\r\n\r\nthought  of that? Talk of liberties and this and  that!\r\n\r\nFreedom  from gangsters during the Japanese  occupation\r\n\r\nis  all  right,  but  what about the  Government  then?\r\n\r\nFreedom  from  gangsters next year probably,  but  what\r\n\r\nabout  the Government that you are going to get?  Think\r\n\r\nof  that  first. What price liberty! And that, Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthe  weakness  of democracy. Democracy nibbles  at  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  A  totalitarian  political  party  gets   its\r\n\r\ncandidate  in, whereas a democratic party  talks  about\r\n\r\nfairness  in fighting an election, and this  and  that.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of all that you get people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncoming out and posing as virtuous ones, like the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar,  by  admonishing  politicians  and\r\n\r\ntelling them not to have anything to do with gangsters.\r\n\r\nOnly,  he would not say what part his Party had  to  do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  gangsters  though in the Elias Report  there  was\r\n\r\nsome  mention of gangsters being tied up in the Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole problem boils down to this. Do we or\r\n\r\ndo we not have confidence in the Police? There might be\r\n\r\nsome  members in the Police Force who might abuse these\r\n\r\npowers,  but  as a whole if we have confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nPolice, then the individual has nothing to fear. If  we\r\n\r\ndo not have confidence in the Police, let us say so now\r\n\r\nin which case we should not pass this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are basic reasons we admit, but in spite\r\n\r\nof education and in spite of all the necessities that a\r\n\r\nhuman  being  wants  we still have  gangsters  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries and gangsters need not be only the poor. They\r\n\r\nneed not be gangsters because of force of circumstance.\r\n\r\nYou  have examples of rich gangsters, gangsters who sit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh  in  society. They are big names and they move  in\r\n\r\nthe  best  of circles but basically they are gangsters.\r\n\r\nTheir method of gangsterism is different; that is  all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  some  places, they call them capitalists,  in  some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaces they call them vested interests but there it  is\r\n\r\nstill gangsterism. However, today we are trying to  pin\r\n\r\ndown  the  gangster  who  uses  physical  violence  and\r\n\r\nintimidation.   Of   course,   politicians   too    use\r\n\r\nintimidation  in  getting votes and getting  themselves\r\n\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Sir, I am afraid that economic\r\n\r\nconditions  are not going to get better. Employment  is\r\n\r\ngoing to get more and more difficult and even if I have\r\n\r\nto say it, I think I should be open and frank about it.\r\n\r\nOur population is increasing at a terrific pace and  we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  not  a  hope of catching up with  the  employment\r\n\r\nproblem  unless everyone in Singapore works towards  it\r\n\r\nand  the  only way to work towards it and to  save  our\r\n\r\nrice  bowl is to get united and fight these politicians\r\n\r\nwho are frightening away all forms of investments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us not talk about capitalism.

As I explained in  introducing\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  Sir, it is the Government's  sincere  hope\r\n\r\nthat  during  the first six months, we shall  see  some\r\n\r\nsubstantial improvement in the present state of law and\r\n\r\norder  and  that  if  it is necessary  to  continue  in\r\n\r\ncertain  cases  the validity of those orders  then  the\r\n\r\nprovision  is  made  in the Bill for  the  Governor  in\r\n\r\nCouncil to do so.

There I am entirely in agreement with him and\r\n\r\nI  can assure him that everything possible will be done\r\n\r\nto see that whatever can be done by the Police to build\r\n\r\nup  this  mutual confidence between the Police and  the\r\n\r\npublic will in fact be done. I was, I confess, a little\r\n\r\nsurprised  to hear the remarks he made when  commenting\r\n\r\non  the  speech  by  the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar  as\r\n\r\nregards  the defence of these gangsters when  they  are\r\n\r\nbrought  and charged before the Court. I am, of course,\r\n\r\nspeaking  only as a layman but I had always  understood\r\n\r\nthat  it was the etiquette of the legal profession that\r\n\r\ncounsel  for the accused does not concern himself  with\r\n\r\nthe  merits  of  the  case of his  client  in  deciding\r\n\r\nwhether  or not it is his duty to represent him  before\r\n\r\nthe Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I may conclude, Sir, by coming to the speech of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Queenstown (Mr  Lee  Choon  Eng),  I\r\n\r\nrealise, Sir, that he has not had very much opportunity\r\n\r\nto  study  the provisions of this Bill and I  therefore\r\n\r\nappreciate  that some of his remarks such  as  the  one\r\n\r\nthat  detention  under this Bill  will  be  entirely  a\r\n\r\nmatter  for  the  opinion of the Chief  Secretary  were\r\n\r\nperhaps made because he has not so far had the time  to\r\n\r\nread  on  a little further in the Bill and to see  that\r\n\r\nthe  order  of the Chief Secretary has not only  to  be\r\n\r\nreferred to an advisory committee but it is subject  to\r\n\r\nconfirmation  by  the  Governor in  Council.  But  even\r\n\r\nthough  he has not had sufficient opportunity  to  read\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, I think he has had ample opportunity to hear\r\n\r\nwhat I had to say in introducing it and I confess I was\r\n\r\nextremely disappointed when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  quite patently ignored the difficulties which I had\r\n\r\nbeen  at  such  pains  to stress over  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nbringing these criminals before the Courts and charging\r\n\r\nthem  under the ordinary processes of law. If the  only\r\n\r\nsolution that the Member for Queenstown can suggest  to\r\n\r\nthis  problem  is to increase the penalties  under  the\r\n\r\nvarious Ordinances that, as I made plain in introducing\r\n\r\nthis Bill, can be no answer to the present problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just conclude, Sir, by saying that I agree\r\n\r\nwith  what  was said by the Member for Serangoon,  that\r\n\r\nthis problem of gangsterism is one with which Singapore\r\n\r\nis  familiar  and it has had its ups and downs  in  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  the lawlessness to which it has given  rise\r\n\r\nbut I think it has been shown on more than one occasion\r\n\r\nthat  in  the last resort the only effective method  by\r\n\r\nwhich this gangsterism when it is beginning to get  out\r\n\r\nof  hand  can be curbed is by removing those  primarily\r\n\r\nresponsible from the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 27; Noes, 2; Abstention,\r\n\r\nNil.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                       Ayes.

All Government servants, except the judges,\r\n\r\ncome  under the jurisdiction of the Ministers;  whereas\r\n\r\nthe  judges are independent of the Executive and  carry\r\n\r\nout the order according to what they think is right.  A\r\n\r\nperson  who is going to suffer detention should deserve\r\n\r\nfull  sympathy and his case should be fully  considered\r\n\r\nin  the first instance.

I think it would be much better to  have  the\r\n\r\ncase  fully  justified  before  the  man  is  sent   to\r\n\r\ndetention, rather than send him to detention  and  then\r\n\r\nhave  his  case confirmed by a person who always  deals\r\n\r\nwith  that  aspect of the law. I say  put  a  judge  in\r\n\r\ninstead  of the Public Prosecutor and you can have  any\r\n\r\nother man on the Advisory Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the Government cannot accept this\r\n\r\nproposed  amendment.  The  hon.  Member  for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nappears  to  have  misunderstood the  reasons  for  the\r\n\r\ninclusion of this phrase in section 47. I would like to\r\n\r\nrepeat, for his benefit, what I said in introducing the\r\n\r\nBill - that  the sole object of inserting this  provision\r\n\r\nfor the consent of the Public Prosecutor to be required\r\n\r\nbefore  an  order  is  made  is  to  ensure  that   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  this  Bill and the  detention  provided\r\n\r\nthereunder should not be used as a substitute for using\r\n\r\nthe ordinary judicial processes of law. It is therefore\r\n\r\na  safeguard  against the police, or in  this  case  it\r\n\r\nmight  be  myself, making an order as being  an  easier\r\n\r\nthing to do under this Ordinance than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   bring  a  prosecution.  That  is  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ninserting  this phrase in section 47 and the subsequent\r\n\r\nsection  58.  The  hon. Member for  Serangoon,  if  his\r\n\r\namendment were accepted, is seeking to incorporate into\r\n\r\nthis  section a further level of safeguard  against  an\r\n\r\norder being made on inadequate grounds. We have already\r\n\r\nprovided  in  this  Bill  for  the  order  to  be  made\r\n\r\noriginally  by  the  Chief  Secretary,  for  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary's order to be subject to review,  report  and\r\n\r\nrecommendations   by   an   Advisory   Committee,   and\r\n\r\nsubsequently  to  be  confirmed  or  cancelled  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  in  Council. Now, Sir, I suggest  that  those\r\n\r\nthree  levels  of  safeguards  are  quite  adequate  to\r\n\r\nprovide what is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in my view, it would be quite\r\n\r\ninappropriate to bring the judiciary into  this  system\r\n\r\nof   safeguards  at  all.  We  are  dealing  here  with\r\n\r\nexecutive powers, and it is undesirable, save  in  very\r\n\r\nexceptional circumstances, that the judiciary should be\r\n\r\nassociated with the exercise or non-exercise  of  those\r\n\r\npowers.  It also seems to me that it would be extremely\r\n\r\nundesirable  that a judge of the High Court  should  be\r\n\r\nbrought  into these proceedings at the stage which  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member proposes. If he gives his consent, it means\r\n\r\nthat  the  judge's estimate and his summing-up  of  the\r\n\r\ncase  that is put before him is then subject to  review\r\n\r\nby an Advisory Committee and finally by the Governor in\r\n\r\nCouncil. Sir, to obtain a judicial decision and make it\r\n\r\nsubject  to review by the Advisory Committee which  may\r\n\r\nno  doubt  consist of two prominent unofficial citizens\r\n\r\nwould, in my view, also be quite wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the hon. Member's reference to the period\r\n\r\nbetween  the time when the order is made by  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  and  when  it  comes  before  the   Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  for  review, I would assure  him  that  that\r\n\r\nperiod  of  28 days is intended to be a maximum  period\r\n\r\nwithin  which the reference must be made, and in  every\r\n\r\ncase the reference will be made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas soon as it is practical and convenient for him to do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> I think, Sir, that it is desirable that I\r\n\r\nshould  say  something here about the position  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic   Prosecutor.  The  moving  of  this   amendment\r\n\r\ndiscloses   what  is  to  my  mind  a  most  lamentable\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding of the responsibilities of the  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor, and while this is no occasion to explain in\r\n\r\ndetail what those responsibilities are, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that the hon.

The fact that he  is\r\n\r\na  Government servant does not mean that in  performing\r\n\r\nhis  functions he does as he is told by any  government\r\n\r\nor  any  Minister.  He  has to act  judicially  in  the\r\n\r\nexercise  of  those  functions.  If  that  is  properly\r\n\r\nappreciated,  as  it  should  be,  I  think  that,   on\r\n\r\nreflection,  the  Member for Serangoon will  understand\r\n\r\nthat  there  are against this amendment  not  only  the\r\n\r\ncompelling explanation given by my friend the Hon, the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary  but also the fact that  it  is  quite\r\n\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, so far as the position of\r\n\r\nthe Public Prosecutor is concerned, I know that he will\r\n\r\nbe independent after the next election.

Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nReport  of  the  Commission of  Inquiry  into  Corrupt,\r\n\r\nIllegal  or  Undesirable  Practices  at  Elections  was\r\n\r\ntabled on 14th April, 1958. I cannot  understand why the Government is moving  at  this\r\n\r\nsnail's  pace.  It could have brought up  these  things\r\n\r\nmuch earlier and not in August. In any case, these have\r\n\r\nbeen  brought up, but there is no decision as  to  when\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee will end its de1iberation. I  do\r\n\r\nsincerely hope that the Third Reading of this Bill will\r\n\r\ntake place on 10th September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the intention of the Government is to go slow\r\n\r\nand  delay the introduction of the new constitution,  I\r\n\r\nwill  tell  them that they are sadly mistaken  if  they\r\n\r\nthink  that they can oppose the will of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. On the other hand, the holding of  elections\r\n\r\nto the District Councils is not inter-dependent with the holding of the general elections to\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to pass some remarks on the age of\r\n\r\npersons  canvassing and taking part in  the  elections.\r\n\r\nThe age limit is set at 21. On what basis, and why? The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar said this morning that you are\r\n\r\nasking our boys to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake up national training at the age of 18 and yet  you\r\n\r\nare  not  giving  them  the  right  to  participate  in\r\n\r\nelection activities. I will go further than that,  Sir.\r\n\r\nIs  there  any restriction if a boy or a girl wants  to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  married at the age of 18? I do not think there  is\r\n\r\nany. If a person of either sex can set up house at  the\r\n\r\nage  of  18, why cannot he or she be eligible  to  take\r\n\r\npart in the elections? Sir, the right thing should have\r\n\r\nbeen that teenagers, or Secondary school students under\r\n\r\n17,  be debarred, but those students who are above  the\r\n\r\nage  of  17  or  who are doing post school  certificate\r\n\r\nstudies  should not be debarred at all. After  all,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  forget  that the population  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nconsists more of youngsters than others and it is their\r\n\r\ninherent  right to take part in politics and  select  a\r\n\r\nGovernment of the type they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I hope that the Government will not\r\n\r\ndelay in getting this Bill to the Select Committee  and\r\n\r\nhave   the  Bill  ready  for  Third  Reading  on   10th\r\n\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown brought up the subject of advertisements\r\n\r\nin  the local newspapers in respect of certain sections\r\n\r\nof  the  Local Government Elections Ordinance,  and  he\r\n\r\ncriticised the proposed amendments in the Bill. Sir, it\r\n\r\nis  considered  by Government that it  is  a  waste  of\r\n\r\npublic  expenditure to advertise in  the  way  that  is\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the law. It is felt that  this  could  be\r\n\r\nachieved  by  just  a  general advertisement  of,  say,\r\n\r\nrelevant  particulars, such as the electoral districts,\r\n\r\nthe  polling stations, and the names of the candidates,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  going through the usual legal  jargon  and\r\n\r\nhaving  to  put  in  an insertion for  each  and  every\r\n\r\ndivision  that is to be contested. In the case  of  the\r\n\r\nlast  City Council elections in December, Sir, it  cost\r\n\r\nthe Government $15,700 just to insert advertisements in\r\n\r\ntwo  newspapers. For the Kallang by-election, just  one\r\n\r\ninsertion  in  one  Chinese, one Malay  and  one  Tamil\r\n\r\nnewspaper cost the Government $800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, as usual, made wild\r\n\r\naccusations against the Labour Front in regard to  what\r\n\r\nhe  says  the  use  of  gangsters in  the  Kallang  by-election. He also made those allegations some time  ago\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly. As a result of such allegations, the\r\n\r\nElias  Commission was appointed and its Report did,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  reveal some astonishing disclosures  regarding\r\n\r\nhis own Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon.

That\r\n\r\nage,  Sir,  was fixed for the purpose of a debate.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  in  charge of this Bill, Sir, in  moving  its\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading, said that it would be  referred  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  and all the points  raised  by  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition will of course be considered\r\n\r\nin greater detail there. So I hope that the Members who\r\n\r\nspoke  on  this  Bill will be appointed to  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while levelling charges at the Labour Front, the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar made an astonishing disclosure\r\n\r\nindeed  when he said that those who came out to support\r\n\r\nhis  Party  during the Kallang by-election did  so  for\r\n\r\nfavours  done. It would seem, Sir, that one must  curry\r\n\r\nfavour with his political Party and that those who come\r\n\r\nout  and  support his Party are those who have received\r\n\r\nfavours from it. It was therefore not surprising,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  me  to  see one Sunday before Polling Day  a  very\r\n\r\nsenior  official  of the City Council who,  because  of\r\n\r\nfavours  done perhaps by the Mayor, was canvassing  for\r\n\r\nhis Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M.

Here\r\n\r\nthey  tried  to  be clean. Please refer to  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndictionary  again  for its meaning.  The  P.A.P. tried\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  means  to  catch votes.

I would suggest that  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  in  considering this  clause,  should  have\r\n\r\ncareful regard to the corresponding provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Representation of the People Act from which  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  will  find  that the  restrictions  to  be\r\n\r\nimposed are probably greater under the Bill before this\r\n\r\nHouse than they are in England, where, for example, the\r\n\r\nexpression  \"member of the same household\"  includes  a\r\n\r\nvisitor spending the night before or after the  day  of\r\n\r\nthe  poll. And far from being less fierce, I think  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Bill will be found to be  much  more\r\n\r\nrestrictive  than the corresponding provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must confess\r\n\r\nI  enjoy  very much having the privilege  of  being  an\r\n\r\nIndependent  Member  belonging to  no  political  Party\r\n\r\nafter  listening to A Party accusing  B  Party,  and  B\r\n\r\nParty accusing C Party, of corrupt practices during the\r\n\r\nby-election  at Kallang.

It  is   timely   and\r\n\r\nimportant, although of course many amendments should be\r\n\r\nmade  to it especially about the age limit and  the  so\r\n\r\nmany  troublesome and cumbersome procedures which could\r\n\r\nbe easily abused by the Party in power to disqualify  a\r\n\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish the Government to assure that the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  will  be  established  as  soon   as\r\n\r\npossible  and give a target date for the completion  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill, in order to fulfil the promise that District\r\n\r\nCouncil elections will be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I wish the Government Party have the same\r\n\r\nconfidence  as the leader of the P.A.P. - face  them,  do\r\n\r\nnot   suffer  from  a  certain  degree  of  inferiority\r\n\r\ncomplex, challenge them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> In reply, Sir, I do not think I\r\n\r\nhave  very  many  points to clear.

He  would  appear to me to fear  that  lack  of\r\n\r\nadvertisement in the press would result in  the  public\r\n\r\nnot   knowing   that   there  is   an   election   and,\r\n\r\nconsequently, that not very many people would go to the\r\n\r\npolls.

Secondly, as the recent  by-election  at Kallang had indicated, it all  depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  virility of political Parties and their supporters\r\n\r\nto make people conscious that there is an election on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Tanjong Pagar with\r\n\r\nregard to holiday on polling day is a point again which\r\n\r\nneeds  clarification.  The Bill which  is  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse only deals with the machinery of local government\r\n\r\nelections.

This is a  very\r\n\r\nlarge sum, Sir, and I think we should require quite  a\r\n\r\nlot of explanation before we can part with $57,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I want to know further, Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir, whether this charge has been  made  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of only certain colonies or whether it  is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  provision now.

If anybody wants to collect his  salary  or\r\n\r\npension  in the United Kingdom, then he pays  the  one\r\n\r\nper cent. Why should the Government pay for him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The Crown Agents, Sir, have performed many\r\n\r\nservices for this Government as well as for the  other\r\n\r\ngovernments   in  the  Commonwealth   and   for   many\r\n\r\ngovernments  outside the Commonwealth. In  respect  of\r\n\r\nthe various services which they perform, they normally\r\n\r\ncharge  a fee. For example, if they purchase materials\r\n\r\non our behalf and inspect the materials while they are\r\n\r\nbeing manufactured and inspect them on delivery,  they\r\n\r\ncharge  a fee. Similarly, they charge a small fee  for\r\n\r\nsupervising  the  operation of our loans,  or  surplus\r\n\r\nbalances  in London and for the handling of  our  cash\r\n\r\nbalances  in London. Hitherto, they have  not  made  a\r\n\r\ncharge   in   respect  of  the  payment  of  salaries,\r\n\r\nallotments,  pensions and passages and  other  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  are connected with personnel. They have managed\r\n\r\nto  meet  the proportion of their total charges  which\r\n\r\nthese   services  represent  from  income  from  other\r\n\r\nsources;  but with the very considerable  increase  in\r\n\r\ntheir overhead charges in recent months - an increase in\r\n\r\nthe  salaries  of the staff employed  in  London,  and\r\n\r\nincreases  in staff to deal with the increased  volume\r\n\r\nof  business - they have found it necessary  to  levy  a\r\n\r\ncharge  on  the various governments who  make  use  of\r\n\r\ntheir  services for the performance of these services.\r\n\r\nThey  made  an approach to the Secretary of State  who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidered   the  matter,  and  it  was   subsequently\r\n\r\nrecommended  to all the governments that  this  charge\r\n\r\nwas  an  appropriate charge for the services performed\r\n\r\nin   this  connection.  We  were  then  asked  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretary of State if we would agree to this levy, and\r\n\r\nin  the  circumstances, we considered that we  had  no\r\n\r\noption  but  to do so. We have been into  this  matter\r\n\r\nwith  considerable  care and do  feel  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nlegitimate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharge  in all the circumstances of the case. When  you\r\n\r\nconsider the volume of business which the Crown  Agents\r\n\r\ndo  for  us, I do not think that it is an inappropriate\r\n\r\namount  to  pay  and I hope that hon.  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly will agree to provide money for its payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar, for many years it has been the practice\r\n\r\nfor  officers  of  this service of  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  of  all the other  governments  in  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth to have their leave salaries, pensions and\r\n\r\nother  emoluments drawn from Government paid in London.\r\n\r\nThe  question of making a charge for these payments has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnever hitherto been raised. I do not think we would  be\r\n\r\njustified at this particular juncture to say  to  these\r\n\r\nofficers  that, if they wish to have their pensions  or\r\n\r\nsalaries  to be continued to be paid in London,  or  in\r\n\r\nthe case of the local officers who are doing courses in\r\n\r\nLondon  or in the British Isles generally, they  should\r\n\r\npay  this  one  per  cent charge levied  by  the  Crown\r\n\r\nAgents.  I  think  it  is  an  appropriate  charge   on\r\n\r\nGovernment and I hope that hon. Members will agree with\r\n\r\nme in that respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, there was no\r\n\r\ncharge  before  for  paying  people  their  leave  pay,\r\n\r\npensions,  and  so  on in the United  Kingdom,  because\r\n\r\nnobody  charged us for it. But if we are  going  to  be\r\n\r\ncharged  by  the British Government for making  use  of\r\n\r\ntheir  services  to  pay pensions  and  salaries  while\r\n\r\nofficers  are  on  leave, it is only  appropriate  that\r\n\r\nthese officers or retired officers either agree to  pay\r\n\r\nthe  one  per  cent charge, or arrange  to  have  their\r\n\r\npensions collected in Singapore. I see nothing  immoral\r\n\r\nin  standing on our rights. In fact, I think it will be\r\n\r\nimmoral  on the part of this Assembly to incur  further\r\n\r\ncharges just for the convenience of these officers, and\r\n\r\nbecause  the British Government have decided that  they\r\n\r\nwill no longer bear the expense of the distribution  of\r\n\r\nthe money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, from the Hon. Minister's\r\n\r\nreply,  I take it that the volume of purchases  through\r\n\r\nthe Crown Agents has not diminished at all; possibly it\r\n\r\nis  still  increasing because the price  of  goods  has\r\n\r\nincreased. The only justification so far is  that  this\r\n\r\nsum  is required to meet the increased cost of salaries\r\n\r\nof  the  staff; but to my mind the volume  of  business\r\n\r\nthat  they get from us has a very important bearing  on\r\n\r\nthis  question whether we should agree to this one  per\r\n\r\ncent charge. In any case, I think that one per cent for\r\n\r\njust  payment of salaries and pensions is a  very  high\r\n\r\ncharge. Why is it not possible for the Treasury here to\r\n\r\narrange  with one of the local banks, say the Chartered\r\n\r\nBank  or the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - or one of  the\r\n\r\nvery efficient banks here - for their accounts to be paid\r\n\r\nlocally  into the officer's account and let  the  banks\r\n\r\nhandle it? We can save three-quarters of this money.  I\r\n\r\nam quite sure that the banks would not charge more than\r\n\r\na quarter per cent for collecting salaries and pensions\r\n\r\non behalf of government servants on leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I am not in a position to say what the\r\n\r\nbanks would charge for this particular function, but  I\r\n\r\nthink  I  am right in saying that we guarantee pensions\r\n\r\nunder the Pensions Ordinance to be paid at 2s. 4d to  a\r\n\r\ndollar.  If  pensions  were paid  locally,  or  if  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  or any other payments to be made to  officers\r\n\r\nin  Britain were paid locally and the money remitted to\r\n\r\nLondon,  they  would do so at a loss to themselves  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  fail to meet its obligation  to  pay\r\n\r\ntheir   salaries  or  their  pensions  or   any   other\r\n\r\nemoluments at the rate of 2s. 4d to a dollar. As I say,\r\n\r\nSir,  it  could be argued that the officers  themselves\r\n\r\nshould bear this new charge. On the other hand, I am of\r\n\r\nthe opinion that this is a charge which Government,  as\r\n\r\na  fair  and benevolent employer, should bear on behalf\r\n\r\nof the officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I must say that this point\r\n\r\nhas  not  been thoroughly ventilated yet.
