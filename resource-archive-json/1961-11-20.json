The Commission pointed out the  adverse\r\n\r\neffect,  from the point of administration,  on  the\r\n\r\nD.P.W. and his Deputy who are too involved with the\r\n\r\ndaily routine administrative work of the department\r\n\r\nwhich  could  be  equally  well  discharged  by  an\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officer. In this connection, it  was\r\n\r\nrecommended  that the former post of  A.O. in  the\r\n\r\nP.W.D. which was abolished in January, 1958, should\r\n\r\nbe   resuscitated.  This  recommendation   of   the\r\n\r\nCommission  was accepted and the post of  A.O. was\r\n\r\ncreated in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Honourable Member has suggested the\r\n\r\nextension  of this finding to the other departments\r\n\r\nin   which   technical  and  professional  officers\r\n\r\nperform administrative functions. This is not a new\r\n\r\nidea and is an important factor to be considered in\r\n\r\nany  organisation. The fact of the matter  is  that\r\n\r\nthe   Head  or  his  Deputy  Head  of  a  technical\r\n\r\ndepartment would have to discharge a certain amount\r\n\r\nof administrative work which cannot he delegated to\r\n\r\nany   one.   Further,   at  the   present   moment,\r\n\r\nexperienced  administrative  officers  are  scarce,\r\n\r\ninsufficient   to  man  all  the   posts   in   the\r\n\r\nestablishments  of  Government, it  is  always   a\r\n\r\nproblem  of getting on with what you have  and  not\r\n\r\nwith  what you would want to have. In the  case  of\r\n\r\ncertain   Ministries,  such  as  the   Health   and\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministries, which  have  a  preponderant\r\n\r\nnumber of professional officers, some officers  who\r\n\r\nshow  a flair for administrative work can be posted\r\n\r\nfor administrative duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO CONSTRUCTIONAL CAPACITY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Interim and Final Reports)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  with regard to the Commission of  Inquiry\r\n\r\ninto  the  Constructional  Capacity  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhether he would (a) explain why the Interim Report\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by the Commission on 4th October,  1960,\r\n\r\nwas   only  presented  to  the  Assembly  on   12th\r\n\r\nSeptember,  1961; (b) state when is it  anticipated\r\n\r\nthat  the  final  report  would  be  received   and\r\n\r\npresented; and (c) make a statement on the  Interim\r\n\r\nReport  indicating, inter alia, Government's policy\r\n\r\nas regards the reported acute shortages of staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> May I similarly ask permission\r\n\r\nto  have  the  answer  published  in  the  Official\r\n\r\nReport?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of answer handed in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is the answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Commission, in their earls deliberations,\r\n\r\nrealised  the importance of the immediate  problems\r\n\r\nrelating   to   the  capacity  of  the   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments   concerned   with   the   Government's\r\n\r\nconstruction problem and to those departments whose\r\n\r\nfunctions and work affect construction activity and\r\n\r\nthe  utilization construction capacity, and decided\r\n\r\nto submit an Interim Report on the first 2 items of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTerms  of  Reference. Briefly these are to  enquire\r\n\r\ninto  the  capacity  of  the building  industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and how it can be expanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that an early publication should have\r\n\r\nbeen  given  to the Interim Report but it  was  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  get  this done  owing  to  the  other\r\n\r\ncommitments, which are of a more urgent  nature  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases, of the Printing Department. But I  may\r\n\r\nstate  that  the  recommendations  have  not, been\r\n\r\ndelayed in implementation in any way through  delay\r\n\r\nin  printing. Before the publication of the Report,\r\n\r\nsix of the major recommendations, including the one\r\n\r\nrelating   to   the  creation  of   the   post   of\r\n\r\nAdministrative   Officer  in   the   P.W.D.,   were\r\n\r\nimplemented; due publicity had been given  to  some\r\n\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Final Report of the Commission of inquiry\r\n\r\nwas submitted to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  on the 16th June. Although the printing  of\r\n\r\nthe  Report  is in an advanced stage, I  would  not\r\n\r\nlike  to  say  when  it will be  presented  to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. But it would not be long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The existing shortage of technical officers is\r\n\r\ndue   largely  to  the  retirement  of  experienced\r\n\r\nofficers under the Malayanisation Scheme and partly\r\n\r\nto  lack  of  fore-sight to fill this vacuum.  This\r\n\r\ndeficiency   is  accentuated  in  a  way   by   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of these technical services. Since  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   took  office,  it  has  realised   the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  an  interim  measure  of   overseas\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  these  technical  officers  on   a\r\n\r\ntemporary basis to tide over this shortage and  had\r\n\r\ncarried   out   negotiations  with  a   number   of\r\n\r\ngovernments  who are in a position to  assist.  The\r\n\r\nresults  have  so  far  been  meagre  as  technical\r\n\r\npersonnel  are  in demand all over  the  world.  In\r\n\r\naddition,   the   number  of   under-graduate   and\r\n\r\npostgraduate  scholarships  in  all   branches   of\r\n\r\nengineering, medicine, architecture, etc, have been\r\n\r\ngreatly  increased. It will be many years, however,\r\n\r\nbefore we reap the benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONTROL OF IMPORTS AND</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXPORTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>First Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill  intituled\r\n\r\n\"An  Ordinance to amend the Control of Imports  and\r\n\r\nExports  Ordinance  (Chapter  214  of  the  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Second Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir.

The\r\n\r\nOrdinance  was  promulgated on 8th December,  1950,\r\n\r\ninitially for one year. It has since been  extended\r\n\r\nfor  ten  further periods of a year each  and  will\r\n\r\nexpire on 7th December, 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Ordinance provides that the Assembly\r\n\r\nmay extend its operation for such period or periods\r\n\r\nas  it  may think fit, in practice extensions  have\r\n\r\nbeen   for  periods  of  one  year.  The  Ordinance\r\n\r\nempowers the Minister to make orders to regulate or\r\n\r\nprohibit the import and export of goods. The reason\r\n\r\nwhy  this Ordinance had such a temporary nature  at\r\n\r\nthe   time  it  was  introduced  was  due  to   the\r\n\r\nopposition  from the trading community  who  feared\r\n\r\nthat   controls,  if  made  permanent,   would   be\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to  trade  and Singapore's  free  port\r\n\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past ten years, most import and export\r\n\r\nregulations have been removed and those at  present\r\n\r\nin  being  are imposed mainly for health,  security\r\n\r\nand  exchange  control reasons.  In  present  world\r\n\r\nconditions,  the  power  to  exercise  controls  on\r\n\r\nimports  and  exports  is  one  maintained  by  all\r\n\r\ntrading countries as being essential in a lesser or\r\n\r\ngreater degree to the requirement of their economic\r\n\r\npolicies  concerning  trade and  industry.  In  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the economy of the State of Singapore.\r\n\r\nit is necessary that the Government should have the\r\n\r\npowers to restrict or direct imports and exports as\r\n\r\nmight be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Trade and Commerce Advisory Council, which is\r\n\r\ncomposed of representatives of the four Chambers of\r\n\r\nCommerce,  has been consulted and has no  objection\r\n\r\nto  the  proposal  that the  Ordinance  be  made  a\r\n\r\npermanent  one.

It is considered that this procedure\r\n\r\ntakes up unduly the time of the House and that  the\r\n\r\nbasic reason for its temporary nature, namely,  the\r\n\r\nfear  of  the trading community over controls,  has\r\n\r\nnow been allayed over these last ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, it is proposed to make the\r\n\r\nOrdinance a permanent statute of the State, but  in\r\n\r\nso  moving,  I  wish to assure the  House  that  as\r\n\r\nbefore the powers under the Ordinance will only  be\r\n\r\nexercised  after careful examination and  with  due\r\n\r\nconsideration to the needs of Singapore's trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nacknowledge that the powers of this Ordinance  have\r\n\r\nbeen  exercised with moderation and for the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the State. I fully appreciate the reasons which\r\n\r\nour  Finance  Minister has given for  making  it  a\r\n\r\npermanent  Ordinance and I am  fully  with  him  in\r\n\r\nevery  one of the reasons indicated. What I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Sir,  is  that  this  Bill  should  be\r\n\r\nbrought   under  a  Certificate  of  Urgency.   Our\r\n\r\nStanding  Orders  provide  that  a  Certificate  of\r\n\r\nUrgency may be utilised, and it has all along  been\r\n\r\nenvisaged that it could be utilised for matters  of\r\n\r\nurgency  which cannot await a lengthy debate  or  a\r\n\r\npostponement  of  a month. Here in  this  case  the\r\n\r\nMinister  must agree with me that there is,  in  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  one  can  ascertain,  no  urgency  of  any\r\n\r\ncharacter whatsoever. There is no question  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  lapsing in any shape or form. [Interruption].\r\n\r\nIt is to lapse shortly. Well, I am interested, Sir,\r\n\r\nto  be corrected, perhaps not in a quite procedural\r\n\r\nmanner. In that statement, the Minister did not see\r\n\r\nfit  to  tell us that the Bill was about to  lapse;\r\n\r\nbut if that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  so,  would  it not have been  appropriate  to\r\n\r\nbring this up at an earlier stage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do urge the Government - we have had two Bills in\r\n\r\nthis Session and in both there were Certificates of\r\n\r\nUrgency  - that  when it comes to  exercising  the\r\n\r\nvery  unusual  powers in the Standing Orders,  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  utilise that power  unless  absolutely\r\n\r\nessential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson did not hear the  words  in  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  my speech and I may be permitted  to\r\n\r\nrepeat that section of it. I said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Ordinance was promulgated on 8th December,\r\n\r\n1950,  initially for one year. It  has  since  been\r\n\r\nextended for ten further periods of a year each and\r\n\r\nwill expire on 7th December, 1961.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  the  reason why this Bill must  be  taken\r\n\r\nthrough all stages under a Certificate of Urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had, of course, originally intended that the\r\n\r\nBill  should he presented to the House some  months\r\n\r\nago  but  events  have been such that  it  was  not\r\n\r\npossible to place this Bill before the House  then.\r\n\r\nFinally  we are caught very short time and have  to\r\n\r\nfollow this procedure of urgency. I can assure  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson that there is no intention at  all\r\n\r\nto  pull a fast one either over this House or  over\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really not a controversial matter for\r\n\r\nreasons  already  stated. We  have  the  assent  of\r\n\r\nleaders  of the trading community, and it is  clear\r\n\r\nto  both  the Government and leaders of the trading\r\n\r\ncommunity that the best course now open to us is to\r\n\r\nput this Bill on the permanent Statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.- [ Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported, without\r\n\r\namendment read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FINAL APPROPRIATION (1959)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"for making Final Provision for the Public\r\n\r\nService for the year 1959\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by the Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee);  read  the First time, to be read  a  Second\r\n\r\ntime  on  the  first  available sitting  day  after\r\n\r\nWednesday, 29th November, 1961, and to be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRIVATE LOTTERIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Private Lotteries Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter 167 of the Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented  by  the Minister for Finance;  read  the\r\n\r\nFirst  time, to be read a Second time on the  first\r\n\r\navailable   sitting  day  after   Wednesday,   29th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1961, and to be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COURTS (ADMIRALTY JURISDICTION) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the law relating to Admiralty\r\n\r\njurisdiction, legal proceedings in connection  with\r\n\r\nships  and  aircraft and the arrest  of  ships  and\r\n\r\nother property and for purposes connected therewith\r\n\r\nand  to  repeal certain provisions of the  Merchant\r\n\r\nShipping  Ordinance  (Chapter 207  of  the  Revised\r\n\r\nEdition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented by the Minister for Health and  Law  (Mr K.

The  separation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  from the Federation is a  criminal  act\r\n\r\ncommitted by the British colonialists in 1945 when\r\n\r\nthe  Federated  Malay States and  the  Unfederated\r\n\r\nMalay  States with the two Straits Settlements  of\r\n\r\nPenang and Malacca were united as a Federation. At\r\n\r\nthat   time.  Singapore  was  excluded  from   the\r\n\r\nFederation. All anti-colonialists did not cease to\r\n\r\nfight  against the separation created by  mankind.\r\n\r\nSir,   I   intentionally  used  the  word   \"anti-colonialists\"  because the  nationalists  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunists have both opposed colonialism and  have\r\n\r\nfought against the separation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n+The motion reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, whereas it has always been the avowed objective of all nationalists of\r\n\r\nMalaya to achieve the reunification of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nand to remove the artificial division created by the British by their policy of \r\n\r\n\"divide and rule\", this House affirms and declares that the first objective of all\r\n\r\ntrue patriots of Malaya is to achieve the reunification of these two territories in\r\n\r\na merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, for the last 16 years, one of the\r\n\r\nslogans   which  was  constantly   heard   in   the\r\n\r\nnationalists' circle, including the Communists, was\r\n\r\nmerger and the reunification of Singapore with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Therefore, Sir, it is no  exaggeration\r\n\r\nif  I move such a motion asking all Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse to support this merger in principle. We  must\r\n\r\npresume   that  all  Members  of  this  House   are\r\n\r\nnationalists. If they are not nationalists, then  I\r\n\r\nfeel   that   they   will  call  themselves   anti-colonialists and non-Communists. Whatever name they\r\n\r\nmay call themselves, we do not ask them to say what\r\n\r\nis  their stand, or whether they are in support  of\r\n\r\nor that they oppose the principle of merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, only the Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  will be in an embarrassing  position  and\r\n\r\nwill be in a predicament to support this merger  in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  and  the principle of merger  which  is\r\n\r\nasked in this motion. To the members of the public,\r\n\r\nthey  say  that  they  wish for  merger  more  than\r\n\r\nanything  else, anti more than anything  else  that\r\n\r\nhas  been  fought  for  by the  P.A.P.  Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it will he strange if they vote  against\r\n\r\nthis motion. However, we know, anti they also know,\r\n\r\nthat  in their heart of hearts, merger is a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich  they do not wish, because merger means  that\r\n\r\nthe question of internal security will be placed in\r\n\r\nthe   hands  of  the  Central  Government  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya,  and  that  their  hope  to\r\n\r\nestablish Singapore as an area separate from Malaya\r\n\r\n`will disappear. But that is their problem. To  the\r\n\r\npublic, they  say they want merger more  than  the\r\n\r\ntype of merger which the P.A.P. is asking for. But,\r\n\r\nin  actual fact, they fear merger. We now ask  them\r\n\r\nto say in this House whether they support or oppose\r\n\r\nthis  principle of merger. If they support  merger,\r\n\r\nthen  we  may be able to discuss the details  which\r\n\r\nshould  be  placed  in  the hands  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  when merger is achieved. Thus,  on  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  they oppose merger, but in public  they\r\n\r\nare  forced to support it. Then when we discuss the\r\n\r\ndetails concerning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  type  of merger, it will he more  difficult.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, Mr Speaker, that the strong men\r\n\r\nin  their Committee have carefully considered  the\r\n\r\nposition.  What  we want now is  that  each  Member\r\n\r\nsays,  \"agree\"  or \"not agree\". If  they  say  they\r\n\r\nagree, then we will proceed to discuss motion No. 7\r\n\r\non  the  Order  Paper  in the  name  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  today which will ask the House to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  heads of agreement set out in the White  Paper\r\n\r\nagreed to between the Governments of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  and  the  working  basis  for  the\r\n\r\nreunification of the two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is no need to have an unnecessary debate.

Why do\r\n\r\nwe  not  hear  of this, and how is it we  have  not\r\n\r\nheard how he has managed to convince the Tunku?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger between Singapore and the Federation, as\r\n\r\nit  is  understood by everyone, had never  been  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  objective  of  the  P.A.P.  In  all  the\r\n\r\nwritings,  all  through the years,  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhierarchy,  merger had always been mentioned  as  a\r\n\r\nlong-term objective. For example, Sir, in  the  two\r\n\r\nbooklets  \"The Tasks Ahead\", there is  no  talk  of\r\n\r\nimmediate or early merger. On the other hand, there\r\n\r\nis  \"The  Five-Year  Plan\". In this  Plan  are  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of   industries,   agriculture    and\r\n\r\nfisheries,  streamlining of  State  administration,\r\n\r\nstrengthening  education, improving the  health  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, improving the welfare of the  workers,\r\n\r\nand  the emancipation of women - all of which have\r\n\r\nnow been forgotten by the P.A.P. leadership, as  it\r\n\r\nwas  proved during Question Time only two days ago.\r\n\r\nBut  at  no  stage, Sir, is there  mention  of  the\r\n\r\nattainment,  or  the possibility  even,  of  merger\r\n\r\nwithin the next five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, during the First Session of the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly in 1959, the emphasis was  \"On\r\n\r\nthe road towards a more equal and just society\". \"A\r\n\r\nmore  equal and just society\" - how inspiring,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbut  that is now all forgotten. You will note  that\r\n\r\nthere was no mention of an early merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, during the Second Session in 1960, the\r\n\r\nemphasis   was   on   the  year  of   construction.\r\n\r\n\"Construction\" again, how inspiring, Sir, but again\r\n\r\nthere was no mention of an early merger. There  was\r\n\r\nno  progress  even on the common market  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. talked so much about. Even now  the  common\r\n\r\nmarket has to wait, as we have learnt only a couple\r\n\r\nof  days ago. Yet within the short space of  a  few\r\n\r\nmonths, all of a sudden, as it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere,  merger  has  become a  matter  of  practical\r\n\r\npolitics  for the P.A.P. and startling developments\r\n\r\nhave been pushed with stunning speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thanks to you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What then will this be a year\r\n\r\nof?  It  has been suggested that the first year  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government was the year of excitement.\r\n\r\nThe  leadership soon blundered the second year into\r\n\r\nthe  year of confusion, and has made the third year\r\n\r\nthe  year  of  desperation. But, Sir, it  is  quite\r\n\r\nevident that there is more than mere desperation in\r\n\r\nthis - the third year. It is already the talk of  the\r\n\r\ntown that this year of the P.A.P Government is  the\r\n\r\nyear of the sell-out - \"the year of the sell-out\".\r\n\r\nYes,   \"sell-out\",  Sir,  because  no  other   word\r\n\r\ndescribes  it.  No other word quite  describes  the\r\n\r\naction of the few leaders of the P.A.P. who have so\r\n\r\ndegenerated with the taste of power that they  have\r\n\r\nnow  turned against the people in their actions and\r\n\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the leap from no-merger and no-common-market\r\n\r\nto  merger and to the P.A.P.'s so-called 12th State\r\n\r\nof  the  Federation, is something  that  calls  for\r\n\r\nexplanation, for it may well be a leap in the wrong\r\n\r\ndirection   and  a  leap  in  the  dark.  Objective\r\n\r\nrealities do not disappear with a wave of the magic\r\n\r\nwand.  The  reasons  previously  advanced  for  the\r\n\r\nseparation  of  Singapore from the  Federation  are\r\n\r\nstill present. The very same people who objected to\r\n\r\nmerger  in  the past are still at the helm  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation. There has been no cataclysmic  upheaval\r\n\r\nin  the political situation over the Cause, way.

It  is\r\n\r\nalso  our  duty to expose the true nature  of  this\r\n\r\ndeal,  and thereby to draw the urgent attention  of\r\n\r\nthe people to the dangers pregnant in the so-called\r\n\r\nmerger proposals of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first preface my remarks by saying that we\r\n\r\nin  the  Barisan Sosialis are students of politics.\r\n\r\nWe  shall  always be so, unlike the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwho  maintains  that  he - and he alone - decides,  and\r\n\r\nlater  on  condescendingly adding his Committee  as\r\n\r\nwell.  We in the Barisan Sosialis accept a position\r\n\r\nof  humility and shall always learn what the  wants\r\n\r\nand  demands of the people are, no matter from what\r\n\r\nstrata  of  society they may come  from.  We  shall\r\n\r\nlearn  from  our  own  experiences  and  from   the\r\n\r\nexperiences  of  others.  We  shall  endeavour   to\r\n\r\nexplain  issues clearly to the people and we  shall\r\n\r\nseek  to  establish  a  government  that  rules  by\r\n\r\nconsultation  and not by decree. It is  a  position\r\n\r\nthat  we, when we were in the P.A.P., Sir, had  all\r\n\r\nsought  to  establish.  We failed  in  our  efforts\r\n\r\nbecause the Prime Minister suffers from an enormous\r\n\r\npersonality  problem.

Let us come down to\r\n\r\nthe pith of the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Newsmen, both local and\r\n\r\nforeign, were kept busy with Press interviews every\r\n\r\ntime  our  Prime  Minister  left  Kuala  Lumpur  or\r\n\r\narrived  back in Singapore. Meetings of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters  of  the  Federation and  Singapore  were\r\n\r\nfollowed  by joint statements which were issued  at\r\n\r\nregular  intervals.  On  the  23rd  of  August,  we\r\n\r\nlearned  that  agreement  between  the  two   Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters had been reached in principle. And on the\r\n\r\n14th  of September, agreement had been reached that\r\n\r\na  Working Party should work out details of  merger\r\n\r\nwith  a  view to bringing about the integration  of\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories and its peoples in or  before\r\n\r\nJune 1963. From no-common market, and even a little\r\n\r\ncoolness and unfriendliness, to integration  in  or\r\n\r\nbefore 1963! All in a couple of months, Sir. Really\r\n\r\nfast work! Fast work that can only come out of  the\r\n\r\nlast gamble of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look into the matter a little more\r\n\r\nclosely,  Sir.  The Federation had all  along  been\r\n\r\nagainst merger. Both inside and outside Malaya, the\r\n\r\nTunku  had  always indicated that he did  not  want\r\n\r\nmerger. In fact, he had said that he would not even\r\n\r\ntouch  Singapore with a barge pole. How come  then,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  the Tunku now suddenly wants merger  in\r\n\r\nspite of all his fears and prejudices? If there was\r\n\r\nhigh-pressure cooking, who was doing  the  cooking?\r\n\r\nWas  it  a piece of fast sales talk on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  of  Singapore?  And  was  the\r\n\r\ncountry  gentleman impressed by the  City  slicker?\r\n\r\nThe Tunku, Sir, had previously \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven three reasons for not wanting merger.\r\n\r\nHe  said that the Federation has a kingship  and  a\r\n\r\nsultanate: it has Islam as the State religion,  and\r\n\r\nMalay as the national language. He was afraid  that\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore were not used  to  these\r\n\r\nthings, and I will quote, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`because of the differences in outlook of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  and  the  Federation', with\r\n\r\nmerger  `differences of the people might clash  and\r\n\r\nthus  create  problems which would be difficult  to\r\n\r\nresolve.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  is in the Straits Times of 17th October. Sir,\r\n\r\nthese are reasons given by a diplomat, reasons that\r\n\r\nappear plausible on the surface, but reasons  which\r\n\r\ncannot really stand up to critical examination. For\r\n\r\nexample,  Malay  is also the national  language  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Then  there is freedom  of  worship  in\r\n\r\nSingapore as well as in the Federation. And we have\r\n\r\nalready indicated that we would accept the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong as our constitutional head, just  as\r\n\r\nQueen    Elizabeth   II   is   accepted   as    the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  head  of the British  Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  these reasons given by  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment are not the true reasons; they  are  not\r\n\r\nreasons  that can stand up to critical examination.\r\n\r\nWhat  then  are  the  true reasons  that  prevented\r\n\r\nmerger in the past? Sir, they are reasons which the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has repeated times out  of  number.\r\n\r\nThey are reasons which the Prime Minister has often\r\n\r\nquoted  in this House in the past. They are reasons\r\n\r\nwhich  are  on  record  in the  Fourth  Anniversary\r\n\r\nSouvenir  of the Petir - reasons which the Tunku  had\r\n\r\nadmitted as such in the Special General Assembly of\r\n\r\nthe U.M.N.O. in Kuala Lumpur on 5th November, 1961.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Singapore has too many Chinese;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Singapore has too many Leftists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, whether we like it or not, these are the basic\r\n\r\nfears  of the present Government of the Federation.\r\n\r\nThey  had  been  used  by the  Federation  for  not\r\n\r\nwanting merger in the past, and they are still  the\r\n\r\nreasons  given  for the continued division  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry and our peoples today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But times have changed. So must our outlook.\r\n\r\n\"Times have changed so must our outlook\", says  the\r\n\r\nTunku. How have the times changed? The number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese  in Singapore continue only to increase  by\r\n\r\nnatural growth. So has the number of Leftists.  Let\r\n\r\nus,  therefore, find out how this change of outlook\r\n\r\nhas come about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this so-called merger issue involves\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation. First, let us take  a\r\n\r\nlook   of   things  in  the  Federation.   In   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  progressive forces are  daily  gaining\r\n\r\nground,  both in the town and in the country.  More\r\n\r\nand  more support is going to the Socialist  Front,\r\n\r\nas was demonstrated in the recent elections. Though\r\n\r\nthe  U.M.N.O. is still firmly in the saddle,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  afford to be complacent any further.  There\r\n\r\nis  every  indication that the  Tunku  is  becoming\r\n\r\nanxious and a little apprehensive. If the socialist\r\n\r\nforces -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am wondering whether this\r\n\r\nmotion  which we are now debating would open  up  a\r\n\r\ndebate on the policy of the Federation in regard to\r\n\r\nthis  particular  subject. I am not  quite  certain\r\n\r\nwhether the hon. Member is relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you will allow me, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  going  to  show  you  the different  situations\r\n\r\nexisting in the Federation and in Singapore. It  is\r\n\r\nonly by comparison and contrast that you see things\r\n\r\nmore  clearly. It will be very short. Sir,If  the\r\n\r\nsocialist forces are allowed to develop and  expand\r\n\r\nunimpeded, then there is every possibility that the\r\n\r\npresent Government may be ousted from office in the\r\n\r\nFederation  in the not too distant future.  But  by\r\n\r\nand  large, it is unlikely that there will  be  any\r\n\r\nmajor change in the Federation political situation,\r\n\r\nat  least  not until the next general elections  in\r\n\r\n1964.  And except for occasional news of skirmishes\r\n\r\nat the Thai-Malayan border, all is peace and quiet.\r\n\r\nThe   U.M.N.O. is  still  the  strong  and  stable\r\n\r\nGovernment that can claim to represent the majority\r\n\r\nof  the people, and the Prime Minister is still the\r\n\r\nrespected  Prime  Minister of  the  people  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  But in Singapore, Sir - now  I  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore - the  picture is entirely different.  Here\r\n\r\nwe  have  an unstable Government that by no stretch\r\n\r\nof  the  imagination  can claim  to  represent  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe   have   a  Prime  Minister  who  is  completely\r\n\r\ndiscredited  in  the  eyes of the  people.  Once  a\r\n\r\nstrong and robust Government with 43 out of  51  in\r\n\r\nthis House, it is now weak and wobbly with only  26\r\n\r\nseats.  The  original majority of 35  has  dwindled\r\n\r\ndown to a majority of only one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the Government stays in office only on\r\n\r\nsufferance.  There  is  no doubt  in  the  mind  of\r\n\r\neveryone,  both inside and outside Singapore,  that\r\n\r\nthe  present P.A.P. Government is on its last legs.\r\n\r\nThat  the  leadership  has  had  to  get  all   the\r\n\r\nAssemblymen   still  existing  on  the   Government\r\n\r\nbenches, to sign a pledge to support the leadership\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P., shows how desperate  they  are  in\r\n\r\ntheir  efforts and in their anxiety  to  remain  in\r\n\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the exposure of the true opportunistic\r\n\r\nnature of the P.A.P. leadership, a great change has\r\n\r\ntaken  place  in Singapore in the last few  months.\r\n\r\nThese changes, Sir, have put the fear of God in the\r\n\r\nhearts  of the Prime Minister and his opportunistic\r\n\r\nfriends.  It is a political situation in which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  after having held the political  stage  of\r\n\r\nSingapore for a time, is now on the decline and  on\r\n\r\nits  way  out. A new star, Sir, has arisen.  It  is\r\n\r\noutshining  the  P.A.P. and it  will  not  be  long\r\n\r\nbefore  the  P.A.P. will be totally eclipsed.  This\r\n\r\nnew  star, Sir, is the Barisan Sosialis. And it  is\r\n\r\nthis  new force in Singapore politics, the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  that  has caused our Prime  Minister  to\r\n\r\nbelly-crawl to the Federation for help -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The difficulty with the Chair\r\n\r\nis  to try and see that motions do not overlap  one\r\n\r\nanother. It appears to me that what the hon. Member\r\n\r\nis  saying may well be said in support of  his  own\r\n\r\nmotion which appears as item 10 on the Order Paper.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is inevitable that there should be  some\r\n\r\noverlapping.  But  if there is to  be  overlapping,\r\n\r\nthen I would suggest that references should be just\r\n\r\nin  passing  and  detailed remarks  be  made  on  a\r\n\r\nparticular  subject when we come to the  particular\r\n\r\nmotion to which the remarks apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I, Sir, just show you how\r\n\r\nmerger  has been used as a diversion by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto  distract the attention of the people  from  the\r\n\r\nfailings  of the Party leadership? I want  to  show\r\n\r\nyou  how  this was deliberately taken out and  made\r\n\r\ninto an issue during the Anson by-election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid I will have to\r\n\r\ntry  and  draw a line somewhere. May I  remind  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member again of the terms of the motion we are\r\n\r\ndebating,  i.e., the House is asked to  affirm  and\r\n\r\ndeclare  \"that  the  first objective  of  all  true\r\n\r\npatriots  of Malaya is to achieve the reunification\r\n\r\nof  these  two territories in a merger of Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation of Malaya.\" I understand  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown to indicate that perhaps this\r\n\r\nis  not an appropriate time for merger. If that  is\r\n\r\nso, he will, I have no doubt, move an amendment  on\r\n\r\nthose  lines. But, of course, that is left entirely\r\n\r\nto  him.  But  I cannot see how the  Hong  Lim  by-election,  or  what use was made of merger  in  the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim by-election, has anything to do with  the\r\n\r\nmotion itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That was only an aside. Sir.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  intended  to mention  was  the  Anson  by-election. May I inform you also, Sir, that I intend\r\n\r\nto  move  an amendment? I will mention that  as  I\r\n\r\ncome  to the appropriate part of my speech. I  will\r\n\r\ntry  and  skip some parts of it. The Prime Minister\r\n\r\nknew, even before the rise of the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthat he was faced with a situation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat was a challenge to his leadership. He did  not\r\n\r\nmeet this challenge in a democratic way. Instead he\r\n\r\nconjured  up the old trick of the colonial  master - the Communist bogey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history has shown that whenever a despot or\r\n\r\na   dictator   is  confronted  with  an   untenable\r\n\r\npolitical  situation, when the growing unpopularity\r\n\r\nof  the dictator brings with it mounting unrest and\r\n\r\ninstability  inside  the  country,  the   unpopular\r\n\r\ndictator  seeks some foreign diversion to  distract\r\n\r\nthe attention of the people, away from the real and\r\n\r\ngenuine  grievances. Similarly  in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\ndiscredited  P.A.P. leadership  has  to  find  some\r\n\r\ndiversion  for  the people so that their  attention\r\n\r\nmay be distracted from the failings and blunders of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. That diversion, Sir, is merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has always shouted, \"independence-through-merger.\" And since they have been exposed\r\n\r\nas  pro-colonial  in spite of all  the  show  about\r\n\r\nLumumba, the Algerian Fund and mock protests  about\r\n\r\nthe  British bases, this merger issue, in  addition\r\n\r\nto   being   a  diversion,  would  also   give   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to the P.A.P. to put up the  time-worn\r\n\r\nmask  and smokescreen of the \"independence-through-merger\"  slogan to refute the charge of being \r\n\r\npro-colonial.  Of  course, this will  not  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Though  they are trying  to  suggest  that\r\n\r\ntheir type of merger is a panacea for all the  ills\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, the truth is that with  merger,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  hopes to be  able  to  defeat  and\r\n\r\neliminate his political opponents with the help  of\r\n\r\nhis  Federation friends. He will then  he  able  to\r\n\r\nremain in office and live happily ever after.  That\r\n\r\nis what the Prime Minister thinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first let me show how the P.A.P made merger\r\n\r\nthe  issue  at the Anson by-election. On 2nd  June,\r\n\r\n1961, six unionists had come out with their  first\r\n\r\nstatement  asking  for full and  complete  internal\r\n\r\nself-government as the minimum demand in  the  1963\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks. This included  the  abolition\r\n\r\nof the Internal Security Council. The Tunku on 27th\r\n\r\nMay,  1961, had already come out with the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nPlan,  and  the  Prime Minister  of  Singapore  had\r\n\r\nresponded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  full support on the 3rd of June, 1961.  Thus,\r\n\r\nto  go  one  better on his critics,  Dr  Toh,  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of the P.A.P., declared that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  in the June 1963  constitutional\r\n\r\ntalks seek \"complete eradication of colonialism  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, asking for complete independence through\r\n\r\nmerger  with  the  Federation or  within  a  larger\r\n\r\nfederation.\"  So  what began as a skirmish  in  the\r\n\r\nHong  Lim  by-election - I will not mention  anything\r\n\r\nabout  Hong Lim -  had become in Anson a real battle-ground,  for contending Parties and candidates,  on\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  the  constitutional  future   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The S.P.A.-U.M.N.O. Alliance called  for\r\n\r\na  confederation in which there would  be  separate\r\n\r\nelectoral registers and separate legislatures, with\r\n\r\na   Joint  Consultative  Committee  to  co-ordinate\r\n\r\neconomic,  financial and other  policies.  External\r\n\r\ndefence and the like would be under the control  of\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  Government.  This,  Sir,  is   an\r\n\r\narrangement  which  would not give  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore any say in the appointment or removal  of\r\n\r\ntheir  Government. We know how the people of  Anson\r\n\r\nhad  rejected  this plan. But the P.A.P. went  one\r\n\r\nfurther. It was merger. Merger then, but we know it\r\n\r\nis  different now. So you see, Sir, the P.A.P. had\r\n\r\ndeliberately brought out this question of merger in\r\n\r\nAnson,  and had made it clear that a vote  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was  a  vote for the merger policy  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need, Sir, to quote how the P.A.P. had\r\n\r\nmade  merger their cardinal issue in Anson. It  had\r\n\r\nall  been  done by the Member for Anson during  the\r\n\r\nlast  so-called crisis debate on the 20th of  July,\r\n\r\n1961.  But I would like to quote just one from  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  of  26th  June,  1961.  The   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was reported to have said, \"We must accept\r\n\r\nthe   Tenku's   Malaysian  proposal.  Confederation\r\n\r\nacceptable to states concerned because Malays would\r\n\r\nstill form the predominant part of the population.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Sir, the P.A.P., thinking they were\r\n\r\ngoing to win, had taken great pains to explain that\r\n\r\nAnson is a typically representative constituency in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Which means that if the P.A.P. had won\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey   would  have  claimed  that  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as a whole, had given their support  to\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. merger plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me summarise the political situation then\r\n\r\nexisting,  Sir, in the Federation and in  Singapore\r\n\r\nin a few words. In the Federation, on the one hand,\r\n\r\nthere  is a stable U.M.N.O. Government, that though\r\n\r\nfirmly  in  the saddle, is nevertheless fearful  of\r\n\r\nthe  slow  but  steady inroads  into  the  U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nspheres  of influence made by progressive socialist\r\n\r\nforces   in  the  town  and  in  the  country.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore,   on  the  other  hand,   there   is   a\r\n\r\ndiscredited and unstable P.A.P. Government that has\r\n\r\nlost  the support of the people: so the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have to find a scapegoat for their  own\r\n\r\nfailings. That scapegoat is the Left. Now that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis has been formed, the P.A.P. has to\r\n\r\nface  a  strong, virile Opposition  that  is  daily\r\n\r\ngrowing  stronger and stronger and  that  is  daily\r\n\r\ngetting more and more support from the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why did you stop your mass\r\n\r\nrally?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Both the Federation Government\r\n\r\nand  the Singapore P.A.P. Government have a  common\r\n\r\nfear of the socialist forces. Both the Governments,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  have a common interest  in  suppressing\r\n\r\nopposing socialist forces. But despite this  common\r\n\r\ninterest  to  knock out the socialist  forces,  the\r\n\r\nFederation  still would not want to dabble  in  the\r\n\r\naffairs  of  Singapore. Because of Singapore's  too\r\n\r\nmany   Chinese  and  too  many  Leftists,  a  bait,\r\n\r\ntherefore, had to be used. What then was  the  bait\r\n\r\nthat  was  made  and offered to the Federation?  in\r\n\r\nother  words, how did our Prime Minister induce  an\r\n\r\nanti-merger  Federation to accept the P.A.P. brand\r\n\r\nof merger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. leaders have always boasted of\r\n\r\ntheir  skill  and ingenuity in meeting awkward  and\r\n\r\ndifficult  situations. I have  no  doubt  they  put\r\n\r\ntheir  skill and ingenuity to good use.  Since  the\r\n\r\nTunku  is  unhappy  and fearful  of  the  expanding\r\n\r\ninfluence of the socialist forces, what better line\r\n\r\nis there then to increase this fear? Because of the\r\n\r\ntwo fears - too\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  Chinese and too many Leftists -  the Tunku  has\r\n\r\nbeen led into the belief that, of the two evils, he\r\n\r\nhas to choose one, whichever is the lesser. And the\r\n\r\nTunku is convinced by these frightening stories  of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister of Singapore. So he now proposes\r\n\r\nto  acquire  Singapore, to  take  the  path  where\r\n\r\npreviously even angels feared to tread.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  may think he can congratulate himself  on\r\n\r\nhis  success for having persuaded the Tunku to fall\r\n\r\nin  with his personal objects and plans. But let me\r\n\r\ntell  him  this.  The name Lee  Kuan  Yew  will  be\r\n\r\nremembered in history like those of Wang Cheng-wei,\r\n\r\nSyngman Rhee. Chiang Kai-shek.

We\r\n\r\nmust ensure that the Government does not debase the\r\n\r\nword \"merger\" to mean something entirely different.\r\n\r\nEven   the   Tunku  has  said  that   the   present\r\n\r\narrangement is not a merger. I will therefore  move\r\n\r\nan  amendment to the motion before the House at the\r\n\r\nend  of my speech as follows. Would you like me  to\r\n\r\ntell you my amendment now.

I have indicated the\r\n\r\ndifficulty of the Chair in the matters we are faced\r\n\r\nwith regarding substantive motions on the question\r\n\r\nof merger between Singapore and the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also the motion in respect of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's speech which also would touch  on\r\n\r\nmerger.  Therefore,  the difficulty  the  Chair  is\r\n\r\nfaced with is, how far could procedural barriers be\r\n\r\nplaced  in  debates on one motion if  there  is  an\r\n\r\noverlapping in other motions? It appears to me that\r\n\r\nthis  amendment might be said to overlap the motion\r\n\r\nwhich the Prime Minister will be moving later on in\r\n\r\nconnection   with   the   White   Paper   on    the\r\n\r\nreunification  of Singapore and the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. That portion reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House accepts the heads of agreement\r\n\r\nset out in the White Paper -'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and  one  of the heads of agreement is \"Citizenship\r\n\r\nand Nationality\". The Member for Queenstown has, in\r\n\r\nfact,  consulted me on this amendment. I  have  had\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity of studying this amendment  rather\r\n\r\ncarefully,  and  it seems to me that  it  would  be\r\n\r\nconvenient  for the Assembly to debate this  aspect\r\n\r\nof  merger which appears. I suppose, to be  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  great points of deviation between the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and the Government. So on that argument, I\r\n\r\npropose to allow this amendment. Dr Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore - and  I  am sure to the P.A.P. of  bygone\r\n\r\ndays as well - merger has always meant one thing  and\r\n\r\none  thing  only.  It  is  the  complete  political\r\n\r\nintegration of Singapore and the Federation, with a\r\n\r\ncommon    electoral   register   and   a    central\r\n\r\nadministration and legislature. In other words,  it\r\n\r\nmeans  a  true  and  genuine reunification  of  the\r\n\r\nterritories  and  peoples  of  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  with all the people sharing  a  common\r\n\r\ncitizenship and a common life and destiny.  To  put\r\n\r\nit  in  another way, merger or genuine  integration\r\n\r\nmeans the entry of Singapore into the Federation as\r\n\r\none  of  its constituent States, with all Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens becoming Federation citizens, having equal\r\n\r\nrights  and  equal  status with  the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  citizens. Let me explain the importance\r\n\r\nof   this  sharing  a  common  political  life  and\r\n\r\ndestiny.  In  the  Federation  today,  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament   is  representative  of   the   Malayan\r\n\r\nelectorate as a whole. The Federal citizens  living\r\n\r\nin  a constituent State, say Johore, may stand  for\r\n\r\nelection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  Federal Parliament in any constituency  in\r\n\r\nany  State - Perak  or  Kedah for  instance - in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  have the right  to  influence  the\r\n\r\npeople  throughout the length and breadth of Malaya\r\n\r\non  all  political issues. In turn, the  people  of\r\n\r\nJohore,   for   example,   may   elect   as   their\r\n\r\nrepresentative,  any  citizen  from  outside  their\r\n\r\nState - for  example,  from Perak  or  Selangor - who\r\n\r\nseeks to represent them. That is, they in turn  can\r\n\r\nbe  influenced  by people throughout  Malaya.  This\r\n\r\nright  to influence and be influenced, is the right\r\n\r\nof  every fellow citizen in the country. It is  all\r\n\r\nfor  the  common  good. It  is  one  of  the  basic\r\n\r\nconditions   for  the  practice  of   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy. It is a pre-condition for ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthe  Federal  Parliament  reflects  the  views  and\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the people as a  whole.  It  is  a\r\n\r\ncondition  which  we  now  have  in  Singapore.   A\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen now has the right  to  influence\r\n\r\nand be influenced by his fellow citizens throughout\r\n\r\nthe   island.  But  what  does  the  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangement  of the P.A.P. amount to? According  to\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku, \"the merger proposals between Singapore\r\n\r\nand the Federation amount to an association of such\r\n\r\na  nature  as  would  recognise the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia   with  Singapore  as  partners   in   one\r\n\r\nidentity\". Note, Sir, the words \"the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia\" and \"partners\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now examine the various aspects of merger.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to deal with\r\n\r\nthe  very  important citizenship issue in  all  its\r\n\r\naspects.  Then if you will allow me, Sir,  I  shall\r\n\r\ndiscuss   the   word  \"national\"  and   the   words\r\n\r\n\"proportional representation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir,In\r\n\r\nview of the decision you have made in allowing this\r\n\r\namendment, may I suggest that motion No. 7 be taken\r\n\r\nand  debated together with motion No. 5,  otherwise\r\n\r\nwe  shall  be debating this matter twice over,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. I do not want to have to answer the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  and  no doubt  other  speakers  on\r\n\r\ncitizenship, nationality, a common political  life,\r\n\r\nand   people  living  in  Singapore  standing   for\r\n\r\nelections  in Trengganu, and so on, and repeat  the\r\n\r\nwhole business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagain  in motion No. 7.

If  it  is for the convenience  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  that  all aspects of the merger  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation should now be touched\r\n\r\non, then the procedure would be that the debate on\r\n\r\nwhich we have now entered would range over item  7\r\n\r\nand  item  10; and then after the debate has  been\r\n\r\ncompleted, there will only be a vote, if a vote is\r\n\r\ncalled for on a division, on item 7 and item 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Motion (Item) No 7 reads as follows:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House accepts the heads of agreement set out in the White Paper Cmd.33\r\n\r\nof 1961 agreed to between the Government of the State of Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya as a working basis for a reunification of the two territories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Item 10 reads as follows:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly views with grave concern and anxiety the exclusion of the Opposition\r\n\r\nParties in the current \"merger\" negotiations, and demands that the Government convene\r\n\r\nforthwith an All-Party Conference to discuss and to agree on all basic questions on the\r\n\r\nconstitutional future of Singapore; and failing agreement, demands that the Government\r\n\r\nseek without delay a new mandate from the people.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So be it.

If  there  are several motions  before  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  which appear to overlap or, in fact,  do\r\n\r\noverlap, then it is permissible, with the  assent\r\n\r\nof  hon. Members of course, for the debate on  one\r\n\r\nmotion  to  range over the aspects  of  the  other\r\n\r\nmotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular instance, we are now debating\r\n\r\nitem  5,  which has the word \"merger\" in  it,  and\r\n\r\nwhich  the  hon.  Member  for  Queenstown  is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied with. And in order to explain why he  is\r\n\r\ndissatisfied   with  merger,  he  has   moved   an\r\n\r\namendment which in effect asks permission to range\r\n\r\nover  certain  items which have  been  covered  in\r\n\r\nPaper  Cmd. 33 of 1961, the subject matter of  the\r\n\r\nmotion  standing in the name of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nas  item 7 on the Order Paper.

Then  I  shall   discuss\r\n\r\n\"national\" and proportional representation. Then  I\r\n\r\nshall discuss this so-called autonomy on labour and\r\n\r\neducation,  which is being used as a sop  to  cover\r\n\r\nthis lack of proportional representation. After all\r\n\r\nthat, I shall then discuss whether the P.A.P.'s so-called  merger  proposals will help us  attain  the\r\n\r\ndesirable  objectives which merger is  supposed  to\r\n\r\nachieve,  namely, independence, economic prosperity\r\n\r\nand national unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate, Sir, that the Federation is\r\n\r\nprepared only to accept Singapore as a partner.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the Federation only wants our country but not\r\n\r\nour  people.  It  wants our country  only,  if  the\r\n\r\npolitical  influence  of the  people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncould be reduced to the minimum. Thus we find  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s  brand of merger is an unholy  scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby  the people of Singapore become politically\r\n\r\ncastrated   by  being  segregated,  with   separate\r\n\r\ncitizenship and without proportional representation\r\n\r\nin the Federal Parliament. This, Sir, is worse than\r\n\r\nsecond-class   citizenship   to   the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Thus, under the P.A.P. scheme of things,\r\n\r\nthe  political influence of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  kept  to  the  minimum  possible  by  two\r\n\r\nmethods: (1) by segregating the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people of the Federation under  separate\r\n\r\ncitizenship  arrangements; (2) by  not  giving  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  the  right  of  proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation in the Federal Parliament. These are\r\n\r\nugly  features which the P.A.P. hopes to  sugarcoat\r\n\r\nand  make  acceptable to our people. It is  against\r\n\r\nthis    background   of   unholy   intrigues    and\r\n\r\nmachinations that we must view the P.A.P.'s present\r\n\r\npropaganda on \"merger\" (inverted commas),  \"merger\"\r\n\r\nin   general  and  on  the  citizenship  issue   in\r\n\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this point let me first\r\n\r\nanswer the malicious falsehood put up by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthat  we  in  the Barisan Sosialis  are  afraid  of\r\n\r\nmerger  because we are afraid of internal  security\r\n\r\nbeing  controlled  by the Central Government.  Even\r\n\r\nlast  night  over Radio Singapore, which  has  now\r\n\r\nbecome  the private organ of the P.A.P., the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  repeated the same falsehood. He  said  we\r\n\r\nare opposing his so-called merger plans because  we\r\n\r\nare  afraid that Internal Security will come  under\r\n\r\nthe  control  of  a strong Central Government.  The\r\n\r\nonly  truth in this, Sir, is that he has  admitted,\r\n\r\nby  implication,  that his own  Government  is  not\r\n\r\nstrong, and this, the whole lot of people, everyone\r\n\r\nof us, already know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have already stated in the most\r\n\r\nunequivocal  terms  that we are fully  prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept  a complete merger, and we will only be  too\r\n\r\nglad  to say \"yes\" if the Tunku says tomorrow  that\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould have complete merger. As everybody realises,\r\n\r\nand  the Prime Minister above all, though he is not\r\n\r\nprepared to admit this, internal security will  be,\r\n\r\nof   course,  under  the  control  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment in a complete merger. Where then is  the\r\n\r\ntruth  of the Prime Minister's statement?  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to  accept a  complete  and  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger even when we are fully aware that this means\r\n\r\nthat the internal security of Singapore will, under\r\n\r\nsuch an arrangement, come under the control of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government. We are fully  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nsocialist  forces in Singapore will after  complete\r\n\r\nmerger  face  the  probability of  having  to  make\r\n\r\ncertain  sacrifices - sacrifices which our socialist\r\n\r\ncomrades  in  the Federation are now  making.  But,\r\n\r\nSir, we are prepared to make these sacrifices.  The\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of my Party, Mr Lim Ching Siong,\r\n\r\nhas  said as much at the inaugural meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis on the 17th of September.

Firstly, it appears that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  hopes  to  achieve  this  by\r\n\r\nconfusing  the people with the use  of  the  magic\r\n\r\nword \"national\".

There is a word which has\r\n\r\nbeen  used by the Member for Queenstown  which  is\r\n\r\nslowly  sinking into my tired brain. That  is  the\r\n\r\nword  \"castration\".  I do  not  think  that  is  a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  word to be used in  this  Assembly,\r\n\r\nand I think he should avoid using that word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Virile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I suggest the word\r\n\r\n\"emasculation\", Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think even the word\r\n\r\n\"emasculation\"   is  akin  to  \"castration\"   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I will not allow that word either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister hopes thus\r\n\r\nto mislead the people into believing that there is\r\n\r\nno   significant  difference  between   the   word\r\n\r\n\"citizen\"  and the word \"national\". He would  like\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore to believe that a Federal\r\n\r\nNational  is  not  materially  different  from   a\r\n\r\nFederal Citizen. That is point No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Prime Minister hopes to frighten a\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of  the Singapore  electorate  into\r\n\r\nbelieving  that  complete  merger  must  lead   to\r\n\r\nautomatic disenfranchisement of a large number  of\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens. That is point No. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the third one, the Prime Minister wants to\r\n\r\nmake the people believe is that it is unreasonable\r\n\r\nto  demand  Federal citizenship for all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first brace the various statements made\r\n\r\nby  the P.A.P. on the question of citizenship. Let\r\n\r\nus  trace  their twists and turns over this  vital\r\n\r\nmatter  in  their attempt to fool the  people.  On\r\n\r\n23rd August, 1961, the Prime Minister gave a Press\r\n\r\nconference after the first\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njoint  statement  by  the two Prime  Ministers  was\r\n\r\nissued.   While   the   joint  statement   stressed\r\n\r\nSingapore's  autonomy on labour  and  education  as\r\n\r\nimportant  principles to be agreed upon  beforehand\r\n\r\nbetween   the   two   Prime   Ministers,   it   was\r\n\r\nsignificantly  silent  on  the  vital  question  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights for the Singapore citizen.  The\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister,  when  pressed  by   a   reporter\r\n\r\ndismissed the citizenship question as also  another\r\n\r\nmatter  for the Working Committee, to be considered\r\n\r\ntogether  with other mundane things such as  postal\r\n\r\nand telegraph communications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I think almost everyone smelled a rat. We\r\n\r\nhad  all  along  suspected that the P.A.P. in  its\r\n\r\ndesperation was selling out the citizenship  rights\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore in return for help  and\r\n\r\nsuccour -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nimmediately pressed for full citizenship rights for\r\n\r\nall  Singapore  citizens in the, event  of  merger.\r\n\r\nWhat  did  the P.A.P. Government do? They  threw  a\r\n\r\ndirty  smoke bomb to confuse the citizenship  issue\r\n\r\ninstead. On 21st September, 1961, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  at a radio forum [Interruption] said  that\r\n\r\naccording to the Federation Constitution -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have read it, have you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let me quote from the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes of Friday, 22nd September, 1961.

The  next\r\n\r\nday the Barisan Sosialis in a statement pointed out\r\n\r\nthe  falsehood of the statement of the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance.

It  is\r\n\r\ncrystal  clear to all, therefore, that the question\r\n\r\nof  citizenship on merger is essentially  a  matter\r\n\r\nfor  negotiation - remember that - between the parties\r\n\r\nconcerned.

So he started to shift his ground.  In\r\n\r\ngraphic language, he tried to show that the  demand\r\n\r\nfor   automatic   citizenship  for  all   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  was  unreasonable  because  of  what   he\r\n\r\nclaimed  to be different residential qualifications\r\n\r\nfor citizenship in the two territories. He compared\r\n\r\nthe citizenship demand with a dishonest blackmarket\r\n\r\noperation  in currency. Let me quote him,  Sir.  He\r\n\r\nwas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalking  about citizenship and this is the relevant\r\n\r\nportion  from  the Straits Times  of  Monday,  25th\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1961:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This, Mr Lee said, was like people crossing\r\n\r\nfrontiers with currency.

Our Prime Minister  also \r\n\r\nintimated that the Tunku would also think him dotty \r\n\r\nif  he brought up such a demand. I will quote  from \r\n\r\nthe  Straits  Times of Monday, 25th September. The relevant paragraph is this, \r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I mean I wouldn't for one moment put forward a\r\n\r\nproposition  because the Tunku  may  think  that  I\r\n\r\n[i.e., the Prime Minister have already gone dotty,\"\r\n\r\nthe Premier added.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  you  are,  right there, Sir!

He  said  that in a complete  merger  all\r\n\r\nthose  Singapore  citizens who  were  not  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would be required to register again  and\r\n\r\nto  pass  a language test in addition to satisfying\r\n\r\nthe necessary residential qualification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now, Sir, summarise the twists and turns\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister in his many attempts to find\r\n\r\nan  excuse  for not fighting for equal  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights   for  the  people  of  Singapore.

Let me\r\n\r\nfirst   state   the  Barisan  Sosialis   stand   on\r\n\r\ncitizenship. The stand of the Barisan Sosialis  has\r\n\r\nbeen  clarified time and time again. I shall repeat\r\n\r\nit here once more. Our stand is that every\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen should automatically  become  a\r\n\r\nFederal citizen on merger. That is, on merger,  all\r\n\r\n624,000 Singapore citizens, irrespective of whether\r\n\r\nthey  were  born  in Singapore,  India,  China,  or\r\n\r\nTimbuctoo,   will  automatically   become   624,000\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens. No more, no less. To us  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  this is, to use  the  favourite\r\n\r\nphrase   of   the   Prime   Minister,   basic   and\r\n\r\nfundamental. On this there can be no compromise, no\r\n\r\nretreat,  because in the practice of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, only citizens who have the vote will  be\r\n\r\nable to elect representatives, or become elected as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives,  to  the Legislative  Assembly  or\r\n\r\nParliament.  And since the Legislative Assembly  or\r\n\r\nParliament is the highest seat of authority in  the\r\n\r\ncountry,   it  means  that  only  those  who   have\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  in  the  Legislative  Assembly  or\r\n\r\nParliament  will have a say in the running  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry. This is how the one man one vote system of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship entitles you to the right to vote and\r\n\r\nto  stand  for election in any part of the country.\r\n\r\nIt  means  you  can  determine your  own  political\r\n\r\ndestiny. It means you can decide what your  society\r\n\r\nshould  be like. It means you can decide the extent\r\n\r\nof  your freedom; the government you want; the  law\r\n\r\nyou  want  and  do  not want; the type  of  working\r\n\r\nconditions you wish to have; the type of  education\r\n\r\nyou  wish your children to have; the type of health\r\n\r\nfacilities you would like, and so on and so  forth.\r\n\r\nCitizenship  entitles  you to  play  your  part  in\r\n\r\neffecting  political changes in your  country  that\r\n\r\nwill help improve the society you live in. It means\r\n\r\nyou can share with the rest of your fellow citizens\r\n\r\na common political life and destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the vote, of course, there are a host of\r\n\r\nother  rights and privileges which are only enjoyed\r\n\r\nby  citizens  and  not enjoyed by non-citizens.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore, for example, only citizens get permanent\r\n\r\nemployment in the Government offices. Children born\r\n\r\nin Singapore or are born of Singapore citizens, are\r\n\r\ngiven   preference  over  others  for   places   in\r\n\r\nGovernment schools. Only children born in Singapore\r\n\r\nor born of Singapore citizens, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be awarded scholarships and bursaries in\r\n\r\nschools  and universities. Only citizens get  legal\r\n\r\naid  and  public assistance. Only citizens  can  be\r\n\r\ngiven  land  for  resettlement. Only  citizens  can\r\n\r\napply  for  Housing Board flats. Only Citizens  are\r\n\r\ngiven Singapore passports. Citizens - and this  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  important point, Sir - cannot be banished  from\r\n\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we see the importance of citizenship, Sir.\r\n\r\nIt is not something that comes into the life of the\r\n\r\npeople  only  at  election time. It  is  intimately\r\n\r\nconnected  with  every facet of our everyday  life.\r\n\r\nThe  way we live, work, eat, travel, learn,  study,\r\n\r\nassociate and so on. Sir, if merger is to have  any\r\n\r\nmeaning,  then the Singapore citizen must become  a\r\n\r\nFederation  citizen. Only then will  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  have the opportunity of sharing  a  common\r\n\r\npolitical life and destiny with his brothers across\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway. If, the Singapore citizen  does  not\r\n\r\nbecome a Federal citizen on merger, then merger has\r\n\r\nlost  its  soul. It becomes meaningless. It  is  no\r\n\r\nmore merger. It is only a sell-out - the P.A.P. sell-out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can realise, therefore, Sir, that citizenship\r\n\r\nis  the  lifeblood of the people.  Any  person  who\r\n\r\nclaims  that he represents the people,  any  person\r\n\r\nwho  has the interests of the people at heart,  any\r\n\r\nperson elected by the people, must, therefore, bear\r\n\r\nthese  basic  interests of the people  in  mind  in\r\n\r\neverything he does. He must fight for the  people's\r\n\r\nrights, and especially when the person is the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  claims to represent  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He  must  fight  for  these  basic  and\r\n\r\nfundamental rights of the people of Singapore.  But\r\n\r\nhas the Prime Minister done that? Has he thought of\r\n\r\nthe  Federal  citizenship rights of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  No.  Instead  of  fighting  for   these\r\n\r\nrights,  he  makes  excuses.  He  throws  up   clay\r\n\r\npigeons.  He  strips and teases. The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance first says it is impossible. Then the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  says  it is unreasonable;  and  then  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister says he would be \"dotty\". Let us now\r\n\r\nexamine  why our Prime Minister and his friends  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to fight for the rights of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me deal with the representation of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance.  He  says  that  under  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Constitution  it is impossible - impossible,\r\n\r\nhe  says -  to  have  automatic Federal  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights  for  all Singapore citizens. He  says  that\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger would automatically disenfranchise\r\n\r\nabout half of Singapore's 630,000 citizens who  are\r\n\r\nnot  born in Singapore. I have already quoted that,\r\n\r\nSir,  so it is not necessary for me to quote again.\r\n\r\nOr  maybe  I did not quote, I think. May  I  quote,\r\n\r\nSir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> This is the Straits Times,\r\n\r\nFriday, 22nd September. He says \"nearly half of the\r\n\r\ntotal   electorate   would   be   disenfranchised.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  on  the  25th of September,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is reported to have said that  those  who\r\n\r\nwere  clamouring for complete merger knew  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  impossible  for Singapore citizens  to  become\r\n\r\nFederal citizens automatically on merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would first like to say that there is no\r\n\r\nsuch thing as impossible in the matter of advancing\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of the people. It  all  depends  on\r\n\r\nwhether  or not you have the will to do  it.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure the Minister for Finance knows the saying that\r\n\r\nif  there is a will, there is a way. The trouble is\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister for Finance has not got the will\r\n\r\nto  fight for the people's interests any more. I am\r\n\r\nsorry he is not here, Sir,I would like him to hear\r\n\r\nthis. He is now fighting for his personal political\r\n\r\nsurvival which evidently depends on forces  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  He knows that if he should go  back  to\r\n\r\nKreta  Ayer at the next general elections, he  will\r\n\r\nbe  very lucky if he does not lose his deposit. He,\r\n\r\ntherefore, has to consider first, the interests  of\r\n\r\nforces outside Singapore, and not the interests  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  itself. The interests of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, to him, come second.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws, Sir, are made to serve man, not the other\r\n\r\nway round. If a law does not serve the interests of\r\n\r\nthe people but merely obstructs the advancement  of\r\n\r\nthe people's interests, then it becomes our duty to\r\n\r\nremove  or  modify  this law.  As  politicians  and\r\n\r\nstatesmen - that  is what the Prime  Minister  claims\r\n\r\nhimself to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe -  it  is  our  duty to protect and  advance  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people. Law and legal experts come\r\n\r\nin  only to give legal expression and effect to the\r\n\r\ninterests  and  aspirations of our  people.  It  is\r\n\r\nsheer  irresponsibility, to say the least, for  any\r\n\r\npolitician to refuse to fight for the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, just because he chooses to think  that\r\n\r\ncertain laws are in the way. He should not  sit  by\r\n\r\nand  just  cry \"impossible\". But since  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nchooses to harp on constitutional limitations,  let\r\n\r\nus  find out whether there is indeed any truth that\r\n\r\nthere  are laws existing which stand in the way  of\r\n\r\nautomatic  Federal  citizenship for  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens on merger. As I have said earlier  on,  we\r\n\r\nin  the  Barisan Sosialis are students of politics.\r\n\r\nWe shall always be so. I am a medical doctor, not a\r\n\r\nlawyer. Neither am I an economist pretending to  he\r\n\r\na  constitutional  expert. But  we  have  consulted\r\n\r\nexperts  in  our  own way. Sir, and  I  venture  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to the Government Front Benchers  that  if\r\n\r\nthey doubt the Barisan Sosialis' interpretation  of\r\n\r\nthe  present constitutional position, they  are  at\r\n\r\nliberty   to  go  and  consult  the  constitutional\r\n\r\nexperts,  both  inside and outside Malaya, on  the\r\n\r\nmatter.  Maybe the Prime Minister does not care  to\r\n\r\nconsult the experts any more because the Tunku  has\r\n\r\nalready  said that it is possible to have automatic\r\n\r\nFederal citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us see what the Federal Constitution\r\n\r\nsays  about  citizenship for the people  of  a  new\r\n\r\nterritory  joining the Federation  of  Malaya.  The\r\n\r\nConstitution of the Federation requires  that  when\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Parliament admits a  new  territory\r\n\r\ninto  the Federation it must provide by law  as  to\r\n\r\nwho  from  the new territory are to be citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation and when. This is known as automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship on merger. Let me read it out once more\r\n\r\nfor  the record, Sir. Article 22 says (this  is  in\r\n\r\nthe Malayan Constitution Documents):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any new territory is admitted to the\r\n\r\nFederation  in  pursuance of Article 2,  Parliament\r\n\r\nmay  by  law  determine  what  persons  are  to  he\r\n\r\ncitizens  by reason of their connection  with  that\r\n\r\nterritory  and  the date or dates from  which  such\r\n\r\npersons are to be citizens.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 2 of the Federal Constitution merely\r\n\r\nprovides for the admission of new territories  into\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  It is clear from  this  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Parliament has complete  discretion  in\r\n\r\nthis  matter  and, therefore, on  the  question  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  either  in a  complete  or  a  phoney\r\n\r\nmerger,  it  has in any case to provide  the  exact\r\n\r\nterms   of   citizenship.  It  is  crystal   clear,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  that  the  terms  of  citizenship   are\r\n\r\nentirely  a  matter  for  negotiation  between  the\r\n\r\nparties  concerned. In this case, the  two  parties\r\n\r\nconcerned are the representatives of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  The Federal  Parliament  has  the\r\n\r\npower  to  say that none of the Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nshould  become Federal citizens. It  has  also  the\r\n\r\npower  to  say  that all of the Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nshould  be  Federal, citizens.  It  is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nabsolute  nonsense for the Minister for Finance  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  under  the  Federal Constitution  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible  for  all Singapore citizens  to  become\r\n\r\nFederal   citizens   on   merger.   It   is    only\r\n\r\nimpracticable if the Federation Government  refuses\r\n\r\nto  agree on this. But that is entirely a different\r\n\r\nmatter from being \"constitutionally impossible\", as\r\n\r\nhe alleges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th of October, 1961, the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nin one of his numerous radio talks, alleged that \"I\r\n\r\nlearned\" - I will quote, Sir, from the Straits Times,\r\n\r\nTuesday,  10th  October, 196l - \"for the  first  time\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister for Finance at a radio forum that\r\n\r\nout of (I will quote the figures as mentioned here)\r\n\r\n650,000   Singapore  citizens,  only  half - about\r\n\r\n325,000 - were born here and would automatically  get\r\n\r\nFederal citizenship on complete merger.\" This, Sir,\r\n\r\nis  false and the Prime Minister knows it is false;\r\n\r\nfor  to  state that \"I learned\" is to  say  that  I\r\n\r\nlearned  of the existence of a fact. It is  true  I\r\n\r\nheard  the Minister for Finance say this, but  what\r\n\r\nhe said was not a fact but a falsehood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again there is no such thing as \"automatic\r\n\r\ndisenfranchisement\" except as to be provided by the\r\n\r\nFederal  law  which will be passed by  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament  to admit Singapore into the  Federation\r\n\r\nand  to provide for citizenship. Sir, it is of  the\r\n\r\nutmost importance that the people of Singapore must\r\n\r\nknow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,  on merger, citizenship depends on an Act  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Parliament, which in turn depends on\r\n\r\nthe  agreement  reached during negotations  between\r\n\r\nthe  two  Governments. Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish  to\r\n\r\nchallenge  the  P.A.P. Government  to  seek  expert\r\n\r\nopinion   on   constitutional  law,  whether   from\r\n\r\nSingapore or from outside, to check the correctness\r\n\r\nof  my  statement. You will find that I am  telling\r\n\r\nyou  the  simple  truth. The stand of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is  simply this. In the negotiations  for\r\n\r\nmerger  both  Governments  should  agree  that  all\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens on the date  of  merger  become\r\n\r\nFederation  citizens. It is for the Governments  to\r\n\r\nagree that all persons who are already citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore immediately before the merger date  will,\r\n\r\nby  operation of law, become Federal citizens. Such\r\n\r\nan   agreement  could  be  given  legal  effect  in\r\n\r\npursuance   of   Article   22   of   the    Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution.   Whether  or  not   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   agreeable   is   a   matter   for\r\n\r\nnegotiation.  We  in the Barisan  Sosialis  believe\r\n\r\nthat  merger  is  a unification  not  only  of  our\r\n\r\nterritories  but  also of our people.  We  believe\r\n\r\nthat on merger all Singapore citizens must be given\r\n\r\nthe  same rights and status as those enjoyed by the\r\n\r\ncitizens of the Federation. The only way to do that\r\n\r\nis  for the Singapore citizen to become the Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku has categorically stated in the recent\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament debate on  merger  that  he  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  give  these equal  rights  and  equal\r\n\r\nstatus  to  the citizens of the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\nDoes not the Minister for Finance now admit that it\r\n\r\nwas  silly  and foolish of him to say  that  it  is\r\n\r\nconstitutionally  not possible  for  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens to become Federal citizens on merger, when\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku himself is prepared to grant citizenship\r\n\r\nrights to all citizens of the Borneo territories? I\r\n\r\nwonder  what the Minister for Finance was  thinking\r\n\r\nabout  when he pulled this fast one on the  people.\r\n\r\nYes,  why  did he do it? Does he really think  that\r\n\r\nfighting  for  political  power  is  so  much  more\r\n\r\nimportant  than  advancing  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress once again in this House our views\r\n\r\non  citizenship.  The Barisan Sosialis  regards  as\r\n\r\nabsolutely fundamental that merger must mean  that,\r\n\r\n(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  those  persons who are considered  fit  to  be\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore should also be considered fit\r\n\r\nto  be  citizens of the Federation on merger -  that\r\n\r\nis, they  must  all  be  made  citizens  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  by  operation of  law;  and  (2)  these\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights  once  granted  must   not   be\r\n\r\nrevocable for political reasons. Anything short  of\r\n\r\nthis is not merger but a sell-out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, explain why we regard these two\r\n\r\npoints  as  absolutely fundamental. It is important\r\n\r\nthat  the  conversion of Singapore  citizenship  to\r\n\r\nFederation   citizenship  must   be   effected   by\r\n\r\noperation of law, because \"registration\"  may  mean\r\n\r\nthat  Federation  politicians  could  deprive   the\r\n\r\ncitizenship of Singaporeans who do not  agree  with\r\n\r\ntheir politics. For the same reason, to ensure that\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights must not be left to  the  whims\r\n\r\nand  fancies  of  politicians,  we  believe  it  is\r\n\r\nessential  that  these  rights,  once  effected  by\r\n\r\noperation of law, must be irrevocable for political\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of constitutional procedure, it is in\r\n\r\nfact much more simple to let all Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nbecome Federal citizens by operation of law than to\r\n\r\neffect   the   P.A.P.'s   proposals   of   separate\r\n\r\ncitizenship  and  the establishment  of  a  Federal\r\n\r\nnationality,  a  term  that is  not  found  in  the\r\n\r\npresent  Federal Constitution at all. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., by bringing in the Federal national, merely\r\n\r\nproves  our  point, that there is nothing  that  is\r\n\r\nimpossible  under the Constitution. When  it  suits\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.'s purpose of camouflaging a sell-out, it\r\n\r\nis  possible for them to introduce a whole  set  of\r\n\r\nlaws  to  frame  an  entirely  new  invention  - the\r\n\r\nFederal national - whereas when it does not suit  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., everything becomes impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am no constitutional expert but I could suggest\r\n\r\nto  them the following. As the Federal Constitution\r\n\r\nwas  not written to include Singapore, it can  only\r\n\r\nbe  applied  by  analogy. Words like \"Merdeka  Day\"\r\n\r\nwould  have to be read \"Merger Day\". The provisions\r\n\r\nfor  automatic  Federal citizenship on  merdeka  is\r\n\r\ngoverned by Article 14 of the Federal Constitution,\r\n\r\nPart II, under Citizenship, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) Subject to Clause (2), the following persons\r\n\r\nare citizens by operation of law, that is to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) every person who, immediately before Merdeka\r\n\r\nDay, was a citizen of the Federation by virtue of\r\n\r\nany of the provisions of the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nAgreement, 1948, whether by operation of law or\r\n\r\notherwise;.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The   other   clauses  in  this  Article   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  do  not concern us  here.  The  above\r\n\r\nclause  clearly  provides that all those  who  were\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  the  Federation  immediately   before\r\n\r\nMerdeka Day should automatically become citizens of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of  Malaya on  its  attainment  of\r\n\r\nindependence. Similarly' it can be easily  provided\r\n\r\nby   law  that  all  those  who  were  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  immediately  before  Merger  Day  should\r\n\r\nautomatically become citizens of the new Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  on  merger. Under such a  simple  legal\r\n\r\narrangement,  no  citizen  of  Singapore  will   be\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  the Singapore citizenship  status  on\r\n\r\nMerger, for a Singapore citizenship status will  be\r\n\r\nautomatically  converted  to  Federal   citizenship\r\n\r\nstatus  by the operation of such a law. Under  such\r\n\r\nan arrangement, therefore, those Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nwho  were  not  born  in  Singapore  and  who  have\r\n\r\nobtained    Singapore   citizenship    either    by\r\n\r\nregistration or by naturalization need not have  to\r\n\r\nregister  again for Federal citizenship  rights.  I\r\n\r\nrepeat  \"need not have to register again for Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights\". The question  of  residential\r\n\r\nqualification and language test will  therefore  be\r\n\r\nirrelevant. This law will apply only to persons who\r\n\r\nimmediately before Merger Day are already  citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore; that is, all persons who are already\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore immediately  before  merger\r\n\r\nwill,  by  operation  of  this  law,  automatically\r\n\r\nbecome  Federal  citizens. It is therefore  only  a\r\n\r\ntransitional provision and is not intended to apply\r\n\r\nto  any  other person whatever his connection  with\r\n\r\nSingapore after merger. After merger, the  position\r\n\r\nof citizenship rights for those persons who are not\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  before  Merger  Day  will   be\r\n\r\ngoverned  by non-transitional citizenship  laws  as\r\n\r\nstated in Part III of the Federal Constitution.  In\r\n\r\nother words,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, all persons born in Singapore on or after  the\r\n\r\ndate  of  merger will automatically become  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  by right of birth, just like  any  person\r\n\r\nborn  now in the Federation; whereas those  persons\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  who  are not citizens  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nimmediately  before  merger  - and  therefore   not\r\n\r\nentitled   to  automatic  Federal  citizenship   by\r\n\r\noperation   of   the  above-mentioned  transitional\r\n\r\nprovision - may subsequently become Federal citizens\r\n\r\neither  by registration or by naturalization  under\r\n\r\nexisting   Federal  citizenship  laws,  which   for\r\n\r\npractical  purposes  are the same  as  the  present\r\n\r\ncitizenship  laws in Singapore. I think  our  legal\r\n\r\nluminaries in this Chamber can verify all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have clearly shown that under\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution of the Federation, it is not only\r\n\r\nnot  impossible  but, on the contrary,  absolutely\r\n\r\npossible - and  in  fact also quite  simple - for  all\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens to become Federal  citizens  on\r\n\r\nmerger.  The  problem only lies  in  obtaining  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government's consent to agreeing on  the\r\n\r\njust  and  legitimate aspirations of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all this is a matter for negotiation. Our\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has a responsibility to look  after\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the people of Singapore. Why  has\r\n\r\nhe  not done so? Has he to depend on Lim Kean  Siew\r\n\r\nand  Seenivasagam? If the Federation Government  is\r\n\r\ntruly  sincere in wanting merger and achieving  the\r\n\r\ngenuine  unification  of the  peoples  of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories,  then  it  must accept  all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens as citizens of the Federation on merger in\r\n\r\nthe  same  way  as  it is prepared  to  accept  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of the Borneo territories on formation  of\r\n\r\nthe Tunku's Malaysia. This is not a demand that can\r\n\r\nbe  construed as \"Communist-inspired or placing  ob\r\n\r\nstacles\" - the Prime Minister's words -  in the way  of\r\n\r\nmerger. It is simply a fair and democratic  way  of\r\n\r\nachieving  the political integration of the  people\r\n\r\nof  both  territories based on equality,  democracy\r\n\r\nand  justice. The Prime Minister said,  \"Conditions\r\n\r\nmust be fair and just.\" Is it fair and just to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  when he does not  automatically\r\n\r\nbecome a Federal citizen on merger? If\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  merger, why harp on merger  all  the\r\n\r\ntime?

They are traitors, treacherous\r\n\r\ntraitors! If the Prime Minister of Singapore fights\r\n\r\nfor  the  interests  of  non-Singaporeans  and  for\r\n\r\nforces outside Singapore, he is not only a traitor\r\n\r\nhut  a  super-traitor. If the P.A.P. Government  is\r\n\r\nsincere in guarding the interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, he must not negotiate for merger with an\r\n\r\nattitude of defeatism and submissiveness. Merger is\r\n\r\nsomething that should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbring  mutual  benefit  to  the  peoples  of   both\r\n\r\nterritories.

Now that they have lost the people's support,\r\n\r\nit is clear that they are now approaching the Tunku\r\n\r\nnot only on bended knees but also with outstretched\r\n\r\nhands waiting for alms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the basis of our negotiations\r\n\r\non merger must be on whether it is to the interests\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore, and not whether it  is\r\n\r\nacceptable  to the Federation Government.  What  is\r\n\r\nunacceptable to the Federation Government  may  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily be bad for the people of Singapore, and\r\n\r\nwhat is acceptable to the Federation Government may\r\n\r\nnot   necessarily  be  good  for  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. If the interests of our people  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  looked after, then it is our duty to fight  for\r\n\r\nthem,  even at `the risk of being considered dotty.\r\n\r\nIt  is  for us then to convince our friends  across\r\n\r\nthe  table that we are, in fact, not dotty but  are\r\n\r\nmerely asking for something that is legitimate  and\r\n\r\nreasonable for our people. It may be that our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in his desperation has gone dotty  in  not\r\n\r\nhaving fought for the basic interests of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.

The salient features are that a  person\r\n\r\ncan  become a Federal citizen `by operation of  law\r\n\r\nif  he  was (a) a citizen of the Federation  before\r\n\r\nMerdeka  Day, or (b) was born in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya on or after Merdeka Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Citizenship by registration\" - I have no wish to\r\n\r\nread  this out, Sir, but for the record I think  it\r\n\r\nis  useful.  There are three main  categories:  (a)\r\n\r\nCitizenship by registration (wives and children  of\r\n\r\ncitizens)  as  provided in Article 15:  residential\r\n\r\nqualification and language test are not required in\r\n\r\nthese   cases.   (b)  Citizenship  by  registration\r\n\r\n(persons born in the Federation before Merdeka Day)\r\n\r\nas   provided   for  in  Article   16:   the   main\r\n\r\nrequirements  here are a residential  qualification\r\n\r\nof  at  least  five years during  the  seven  years\r\n\r\nimmediately preceding the date of application, that\r\n\r\nhe  is  of  good character, that he  must  have  an\r\n\r\nelementary  knowledge of the Malay language.  This\r\n\r\nlanguage   requirement   is   waived   where    the\r\n\r\napplications  were  made  within  one  year   after\r\n\r\nMerdeka  Day - for one year they need  not  have  to\r\n\r\nbother  about  the Malay language  test.  And  then\r\n\r\nunder  (c)  \"Citizenship by  registration  (persons\r\n\r\nresident  in  the  Federation on Merdeka  Day)\"  as\r\n\r\nspecified  in  Article 17. Here the requirement  is\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  that  in Article 16  except  that  the\r\n\r\nresidential qualification is 8 out of the 12  years\r\n\r\nimmediately  preceding  application.  The  language\r\n\r\nrequirement is also waived during the first year of\r\n\r\nMerdeka,  and also for those who have attained  the\r\n\r\nage\r\n\r\nof 45 on the date of application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes \"Citizenship by naturalization\". Here\r\n\r\nthe    main    requirements   are   a   residential\r\n\r\nqualification  of  10 years out  of  the  12  years\r\n\r\npreceding   application.  He  must   be   of   good\r\n\r\ncharacter.  He must have an adequate  knowledge  of\r\n\r\nthe Malay language. You will note that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  is playing only  on  the  ten-year\r\n\r\nresidential qualification and the language  barrier\r\n\r\nin the naturalization laws in order to frighten the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore who were not born here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now briefly, Sir, see how the citizenship\r\n\r\nlaws    in   Singapore   operate.   The   Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizenship Ordinance, 1957, came into force on 1st\r\n\r\nNovember,  1957.  Under this  Ordinance,  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship   could  be  acquired   by   birth   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  citizenship by descent, citizenship  by\r\n\r\nregistration,  which has two main  categories - those\r\n\r\nborn  in  the Federation and those who are citizens\r\n\r\nof  the  United  Kingdom and British colonies.  The\r\n\r\nresidential qualification here was only two  years.\r\n\r\nFor  those who were born in China and other foreign\r\n\r\ncountries, the residential qualification  here  was\r\n\r\nthat  they must have 8 years' residence immediately\r\n\r\npreceding  the  date  when  application  for   this\r\n\r\ncategory  of citizenship should be made within  two\r\n\r\nyears  from 1st November, 1957. Incidentally,  Sir,\r\n\r\ncitizenship  by naturalization did  not  come  into\r\n\r\nforce on 1st November, 1957. The Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nchosen  to emphasise this residential qualification\r\n\r\nof  two years for those born in the Federation  and\r\n\r\nthe  U.K. and Colonies, and 8 years for those  born\r\n\r\nelsewhere, and  argues that it  is  therefore  not\r\n\r\nreasonable  for these groups of Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nto  demand Federation citizenship rights in view of\r\n\r\nthe ten-year residential qualification and language\r\n\r\ntests required under the naturalization laws of the\r\n\r\nFederation. In support of his argument,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister takes on those Singapore citizens who were\r\n\r\nnot born here. The Prime Minister has conceded that\r\n\r\nall Singapore citizens who were born here have the\r\n\r\nright  to automatic Federal citizenship on complete\r\n\r\nmerger   though, and  we  must  note   this   very\r\n\r\ncarefully, Sir, the P.A.P.'s phoney merger does not\r\n\r\neven  give these rights. But I shall deal with that\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument of the Prime Minister centres on\r\n\r\nthose Singapore citizens who were not born here and\r\n\r\nis  based  on  two points: (a) an alleged  lack  of\r\n\r\nresidential qualification of ten years as  required\r\n\r\nby the Federation naturalisation law; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(b)  the fact that these Singapore citizens did not\r\n\r\nundergo  a Malay language test as required  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation laws. At first the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\non the 21st of September, 1961, contended that \"all\r\n\r\nthese  300,000-odd citizens\" - those were the figures\r\n\r\nat   the   moment,  Sir - \"not  born  here   would\r\n\r\nautomatically  lose  their  citizenship  rights  on\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger.\" But later, on the 27th  October,\r\n\r\n1961,  the Prime Minister cut this down to 200,000.\r\n\r\nsaying  that 100,000 - of course, the figure  now  is\r\n\r\n110,000 - of this 300,000 may successfully apply  for\r\n\r\nregistration  and pass the language  test.  Let  me\r\n\r\nfirst   dismiss  all  this  hullabaloo  about   the\r\n\r\nlanguage   qualification.  Under   the   Federation\r\n\r\nConstitution, this language requirement was  waived\r\n\r\nfor  applicants during the first year after Merdeka\r\n\r\nDay,  as  I  have already mentioned, and for  those\r\n\r\nreaching  45  years of age, it is not necessary  at\r\n\r\nall.  Is the Prime Minister saying that this cannot\r\n\r\nalso  be  done in the case of merger, and that  the\r\n\r\nlanguage barrier cannot be waived during the  first\r\n\r\nyear after merger? Does the Prime Minister want  to\r\n\r\nlay down conditions even harsher and more stringent\r\n\r\nthan  the Federation constitution? Already  as  the\r\n\r\nresult   of  memoranda  and  representations   from\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  and past P.A.P. Branch executives  who\r\n\r\nare now with the Barisan Sosialis -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Oh God!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the Malay language test in\r\n\r\nSingapore is now waived for all those over  thirty.\r\n\r\nI   wonder  if  it  has  been  done.  It  has  been\r\n\r\nrecommended.  We recommended it, and  I  hope  they\r\n\r\nhave  carried this out. So the Malay language  test\r\n\r\nshould not be a barrier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then deal with alleged lack of residential\r\n\r\nqualification.  Here again the  Prime  Minister  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to  be  more stringent than the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.   He  must  insist  on   the   ten-year\r\n\r\nresidential   qualification  required   under   the\r\n\r\nnaturalization laws, and conveniently forgets  that\r\n\r\nthe    Federation   Constitution    provides    for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  by  registration for  those  who  were\r\n\r\nresident  in  the  Federation on Merdeka  Day,  the\r\n\r\nresidential qualification here being only 8  years.\r\n\r\nWe want to ask: Why cannot this pro-vision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  those who  are  resident  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  Merger Day? After all, is  not  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister trying to tell us that he is getting\r\n\r\nus  Merdeka through merger? But let me argue on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of his ten-year qualification. The  fact  is\r\n\r\nthat  most of the people in Singapore who were  not\r\n\r\nborn  here  have  been residing here  since  1952,\r\n\r\nexcept  for those who come from the Federation  and\r\n\r\nwho   cannot   be  considered  as  aliens   anyway.\r\n\r\nStringent safeguards were made to guard against the\r\n\r\nlarge influx of aliens after the war, and according\r\n\r\nto  immigration reports of post-war years a  policy\r\n\r\nof  selective immigration on a severely  restricted\r\n\r\nbasis   was   introduced.  When   the   Immigration\r\n\r\nOrdinance   of   1952  was  passed  providing   for\r\n\r\nselective  immigration, control of entry of  aliens\r\n\r\nbecame  even  more  strict. Most of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens   who   obtained  their   citizenship   by\r\n\r\nregistration  in 1957 did so under the requirements\r\n\r\nof 8 years' residential qualification. In fact, the\r\n\r\nreason given by the then chief Minister for this 8-year  residential qualification was that it was  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  registration  procedure,  as   the\r\n\r\nidentity  card system was introduced in late  1948.\r\n\r\nThe  registration of these citizens was done mainly\r\n\r\non  the basis of the 1948 identity card. That is to\r\n\r\nsay,  most  of the Singapore citizens who  obtained\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship by registration in 1957 have,  in\r\n\r\nfact, been resident here since -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.

That  is  more than the ten-year  residential\r\n\r\nqualification   required   under   the   Federation\r\n\r\nnaturalization law, which only require 10 years out\r\n\r\nof  12.  And  by 1963 when \"merger\" is supposed  to\r\n\r\ntake  place (inverted commas \"merger\"), they  will\r\n\r\nhave 13 plus two, which means 15 years' residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Where?

Those questions, of course,\r\n\r\nare rhetorical and the Prime Minister will have  an\r\n\r\nopportunity of replying in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As I have pointed out, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  provision  of the 1957 Singapore  Citizenship\r\n\r\nOrdinance   allowing  only  8  year's   residential\r\n\r\nqualification  was operative only  for  a  two-year\r\n\r\nperiod, that is from 1957 to 1959. Even where those\r\n\r\ncitizens registered themselves at the end  of  this\r\n\r\ntwo-year  period, that is, in 1959 - let us calculate\r\n\r\narithmetic,  Sir - they still have by now  at  least\r\n\r\nten  years' residential qualification, because when\r\n\r\nthey  registered two years ago, in 1959, they  must\r\n\r\nhave  at  that  time at least 8 years residence  in\r\n\r\norder  to  qualify. Let us add 2 to 8, that  is  by\r\n\r\n1961 - that  gives  you  10,  which  should   already\r\n\r\nsatisfy the 10-year residential qualification.  And\r\n\r\nif  we  should add 2 to 10, that is to say by 1963,\r\n\r\nwhen  this phoney merger is supposed to take place.\r\n\r\nthey   will  have  already  12  years'  residential\r\n\r\nqualification. The fact, therefore,  then  is  that\r\n\r\nmost of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  300,000 Singapore citizens who were  not  born\r\n\r\nhere  have  by now at least 10 years' residence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  by 1963 it will be  at  least  12\r\n\r\nyears. The few that do not have 10 years' residence\r\n\r\nare those who have obtained citizenship rights with\r\n\r\nthe  2-year residential qualification provided  for\r\n\r\nin  the  1957  Singapore Citizenship Ordinance  for\r\n\r\nthose either born in the Federation or in the  U.K.\r\n\r\nand  Colonies. Most of them in this group were,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   born  in  the  Federation  and  cannot   be\r\n\r\nconsidered as aliens to this country at  any  rate.\r\n\r\nThese  Singapore  citizens born in  the  Federation\r\n\r\ncould  in  any  case obtain Federal citizenship  by\r\n\r\nregistration  under Federal citizenship  laws  with\r\n\r\nonly a 5-year residential qualification and not  10\r\n\r\nyears - not  10  years. Moreover, in  May  1960,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. amended the citizenship laws in Singapore. I\r\n\r\nhave  got it down here as No. 40 of 1960 - I  am  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  quote  that, Sir - and thereafter  persons\r\n\r\nborn  in the Federation require an 8-year residence\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  before  they  can  become  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.  So  what is all this  talk  about  black\r\n\r\nmarketing and currency exchange cheating  and  all\r\n\r\nthat?  Why all this cheating? Why cannot the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders come out with the truth and tell the people\r\n\r\nthat they have not been doing their duty, that they\r\n\r\nhave been irresponsible to the people of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  that  they  have not been  looking  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people? The number of persons born\r\n\r\nin   the   U.K. and  Colonies  who  have  obtained\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship  under  the  1957  Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizenship  Ordinance  is  probably  very   small,\r\n\r\nperhaps  a few thousand. They comprise, I  believe,\r\n\r\nmainly ex-servicemen and expatriates who choose  to\r\n\r\nsettle  here for one reason or another.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  cannot  escape  responsibility  for  this\r\n\r\nawkward provision of the 1957 Singapore Citizenship\r\n\r\nOrdinance  as  he  was  a  member  of  the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  which  drew up the Bill.  It  is  clear,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that  the  Prime Minister  is  using  the\r\n\r\nexistence   of  this  small  number  of   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens born in the U.K. and Colonies -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - as a feeble excuse to block\r\n\r\ngenuine merger and to grant second-rate citizenship\r\n\r\nstatus to our people in Singapore.

This is nothing\r\n\r\nbut  a lousy camouflage for a treacherous sell-out.\r\n\r\nJust  because  of  these  few  Europeans  and   \r\n\r\nex-servicemen  who do not have the 10-year residential\r\n\r\nqualification, the P.A.P. is trying to bring  about\r\n\r\na  phoney merger under which not a single Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen will obtain Federal citizenship rights.  Is\r\n\r\nthis  fair and just? The P.A.P. alleges that  under\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger  only those 323,000  citizens  who\r\n\r\nwere  born  here - maybe I will have to  change  that\r\n\r\nfigure  because of the new development  of  624,000\r\n\r\nfrom  650,000; anyway I will stick to this 323,000,\r\n\r\nSir - that  is,  about  half of  Singapore's  624,000\r\n\r\ncitizens,    will   automatically    get    Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship. But Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact is that\r\n\r\nunder  the P.A.P. phoney merger, even these 323,00\r\n\r\ncitizens  born in Singapore, or the new  figure  of\r\n\r\n284,000, will not get automatic Federal citizenshp\r\n\r\nrights.

Sir. My\r\n\r\npoint  of  order is this. That what the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown   proposes  now  to  read  will   create\r\n\r\nconfusion which requires correction;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand he is now proposing to add to the confusion by\r\n\r\nrepeating that mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Queenstown is\r\n\r\ntrying to be historically accurate, but he must\r\n\r\nsay, of course, before `he reads that statement\r\n\r\nthat it was subsequently corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I want to be historically\r\n\r\ncorrect, Sir. It says here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Lee said that after merger, (meaning the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. brand  of  merger) Singapore-born  citizens\r\n\r\nwould automatically become Federation citizens, but\r\n\r\nother Singapore citizens would have to satisfy  the\r\n\r\nFederation citizenship laws on residence and pass a\r\n\r\nlanguage test.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to show the correction, Sir. The next\r\n\r\nday  the  Prime Minister quickly issued a statement\r\n\r\nwhich  said  that the Straits Times report  of  his\r\n\r\nPress  conference  held the  previous  day  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  citizenship needed clarification  and\r\n\r\ncorrection.  In the statement he was - now  this  is\r\n\r\nimportant - significantly silent on the subject of\r\n\r\nautomatic  Federal citizenship rights for Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  born  in  Singapore  after  the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nphoney  merger. In fact, the only thing he said  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens being able  to  obtain  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is this. Now, I will quote  him,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThis is the Straits Timex of 27th October:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any Singapore citizen who wishes to live in the\r\n\r\npresent  Federation and become  a  citizen  of  the\r\n\r\npresent Federation can apply for citizenship of the\r\n\r\npresent  Federation under the laws of  the  present\r\n\r\nFederation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the time it was present Federation laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You said they would all\r\n\r\nqualify, so why worry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, this innocent-looking statement -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of order.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his .seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Could we have the date on which\r\n\r\nthe speech or the interview given by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was published in the Straits Times?
