It is to avoid this amended  Highway\r\n\r\nCode becoming a dead letter that I would like  to\r\n\r\nsay  a few words. You can just take your car  out\r\n\r\non any occasion to any place where there are road\r\n\r\nusers   and  you  will  find  scores  of  traffic\r\n\r\nviolations. Take, for example, The most important\r\n\r\nrule  that has been given some prominence in  the\r\n\r\nHighway  Code,  namely, that of  \"Keeping  Left\".\r\n\r\nComing down Bukit Timah Road or Dunearn Road, the\r\n\r\ntwo  arterial  roads that lead into  and  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, you will find lorries, supposedly with\r\n\r\ndiscs    indicating    their    maximum    speeds\r\n\r\npermissible, keeping grimly to the right side  of\r\n\r\nthe  road and those vehicles keeping to the  left\r\n\r\nside  of  the road are those which are trying  to\r\n\r\novertake  those that are keeping  grimly  to  the\r\n\r\nright side of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that of the speed limit, which\r\n\r\nis  again another point that is stressed in  this\r\n\r\nHighway Code. I think the general tendency is for\r\n\r\npeople to drive at least 10 miles per hour faster\r\n\r\nthan they are allowed to drive. Perhaps this  has\r\n\r\nbeen  taken into account. But let us not  make  a\r\n\r\nhypocrite  of  the law, a mockery  of  the  code,\r\n\r\nfeeling we can allow people to drive faster  than\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould.  In  order to inculcate a respect  for  the\r\n\r\ncode,  one  has to implement this code. This  is  the\r\n\r\nreason   why   I   am   making   this   remark   that\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the code has not been  successful.\r\n\r\nThere  has  been  a  safety  campaign  recently  with\r\n\r\ncertain  limited success achieved.  But  I  think  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  emphasise in all areas, especially  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   departments  as  some  of  the   biggest\r\n\r\nsinners are the Government departments indeed  -  you\r\n\r\nfind  PUB  and PWD vehicles and all sorts of vehicles\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  the  Government breaking  the  traffic\r\n\r\nregulations almost gaily -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Also the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes, including the Police and the Army.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  yesterday  when I  was  driving  home  very\r\n\r\ncarefully,  I  was overtaken by a Police vehicle  that\r\n\r\nwas exceeding the speed limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

What is the use of putting a 30mph disc on a\r\n\r\nvehicle  that  is supposed to be chasing  after  other\r\n\r\nvehicles? Going through this Highway Code, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, just listen to this:\r\n\r\n`When  being  overtaken, never  speed  up  to  prevent\r\n\r\nanother driver from passing.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n`In  traffic hold-ups, do not \"jump the queue\".'

You\r\n\r\nmust  forgive  me  for  being  a  little  excited,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,I have been coming to this  House  and\r\n\r\nrepeating, this again and again but no action has been\r\n\r\ntaken to push across the idea that the Highway Code is\r\n\r\na  very  important instrument of civic education.  The\r\n\r\nHighway  Code  lays  stress  on  responsibilities  and\r\n\r\ncourtesy  and it is an important instrument  of  civic\r\n\r\neducation. I think the Government should do all it can\r\n\r\nto  put  across  this idea of proper  conduct  on  the\r\n\r\npublic road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to subsection (2) of\r\n\r\nsection  65  of  the  Road Traffic Act  (Chapter  92),\r\n\r\nresolves   that   the   Highway  Code   published   as\r\n\r\nNotification  No.  58  in  the Subsidiary  Legislation\r\n\r\nSupplement  to the Gazette of 17th January, 1975,  as\r\n\r\ncontained in Paper S.L. 17 of 1975, be approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMITTEE OF SELECTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this Parliament, in accordance with paragraph (1) of Standing Order 95, appoints the following as\r\n\r\nmembers of the Committee of Selection:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.

The House  will\r\n\r\nrecall  that  on 20th March, 1973, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nannounced  that  the  President's official  emoluments\r\n\r\nwould  be raised from $4,000 per month, which is  tax-free, to $12,000 per month, with $4,000 tax-free.  The\r\n\r\nHouse  was  informed then that the President  did  not\r\n\r\nwish to make use of the increase in his salary. It has\r\n\r\nbeen  decided,  however,  that  as  from  FY  75,  the\r\n\r\nPresident will be paid his full salary of $12,000  per\r\n\r\nmonth, but the entire amount will he subject to income\r\n\r\ntax.

(See Appendix, cols. 195 - 356.) This Survey  and,  I  might  add, the  (Paper Misc. 2\r\n\r\nof 1975.) Memorandum  on  the Estimates and the (Paper Cmd. 3 of 1975) Estimates themselves, have been  the result  of  considerable efforts  by  my  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nimprove  our statistical data and to present  them  to\r\n\r\nHonourable  Members in as complete and  informative  a\r\n\r\nway  as  possible. We are conscious of the many  great\r\n\r\ndefects  still remaining in these documents and  shall\r\n\r\ncontinue to improve on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, they will at least have this immediate\r\n\r\nbenefit, that Members need no longer hear me, even  in\r\n\r\nbrief  recapitulation, on the statistical  details  of\r\n\r\nour   economic   performance  in  1974   or   of   the\r\n\r\ninternational  events which affected  them.  They  are\r\n\r\ndealt with in extenso in the Survey and for those  who\r\n\r\nhave  not  the time or convenience to read it  all  at\r\n\r\nonce, an adequate summary has also been provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need only remind Members that our real rate of\r\n\r\ngrowth  in 1974 was 6.8%, although at current  prices,\r\n\r\nit was 26.2%. Members need not be told that for a non-oil  producer, a real rate of nearly 7% growth in  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances of 1974 is not unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1975/19750303/19750303-HA-0340195.pdf\"\">Appendix - ECONOMIC SURVEY OF SINGAPORE, 1974 (Cols 195-356)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Diversification of Economic Activities</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic strategy puts great importance on\r\n\r\ndiversification  of our economic activities.  We  have\r\n\r\ntried to widen the base of our manufacturing sector by\r\n\r\nintroducing  new  skills and products particularly  in\r\n\r\nmetal    and    precision   engineering,    chemicals,\r\n\r\nelectronics and transport equipment. As a  result,  we\r\n\r\nhave  now these new industries in addition to our main\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   activities:  shipbuilding   and   ship\r\n\r\nrepairing  (14.8% of total value added),  refining  of\r\n\r\npetroleum  (20.3%)  and electrical machinery  (21.6%),\r\n\r\nresulting  in an even spread with no single industrial\r\n\r\ngroup  accounting for more than 22% of total  earnings\r\n\r\nin manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other economic sectors, notably trade and services,\r\n\r\n`have  also  helped  in our plan for  diversification.\r\n\r\nAlthough entrepot trade's share of GDP has fallen, its\r\n\r\nnature  has gradually changed from trading  in  mainly\r\n\r\ntraditional products to trading in capital goods, such\r\n\r\nas   machinery,   telecommunications   equipment   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  raw materials which in 1974 accounted  for\r\n\r\n22%  of total re-exports. Domestic trade has of course\r\n\r\ngained   from   increased  industrial  production,   a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  portion  of which  is  exported.  In  our\r\n\r\ntrading  activities, we have had  also  an  increasing\r\n\r\ndiversity of markets. This has been partly due to  the\r\n\r\nmulti-national companies who have set up industries in\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  bring  with  them  the  international\r\n\r\nmarkets to which they are suppliers. Partly also, this\r\n\r\nhas  been  due  to  our  own efforts  in  seeking  new\r\n\r\nmarkets,  such  as  those in  West  Asia  and  Eastern\r\n\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the services sector, tourism has become\r\n\r\nincreasingly  important. The relatively slower  growth\r\n\r\nof tourists from Australia, US and UK in 1974 was corn-pen  sated  by the high growth of tourists from  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries. In the services sector also, we  have  been\r\n\r\nactively promoting our financial centre activities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the centre, with foreign banks from a large number\r\n\r\nof  countries,  now provides an even  wider  range  of\r\n\r\nfinancial and banking facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction activities which suffered a setback in\r\n\r\n1973,  due  to  high  prices of materials,  have  also\r\n\r\nbounced  back, registering a positive growth of  5.5%.\r\n\r\nAlthough  private  sector construction  has  declined,\r\n\r\nthis  was  more  than  offset by the  acceleration  of\r\n\r\npublic construction which rose substantially by 22% in\r\n\r\nreal  terms. As a result, the construction sector  has\r\n\r\nonce again contributed to the continuing health of our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beneficial effect of a diversification of\r\n\r\nactivities  was  amply demonstrated in 1974.  Although\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  activities  slowed  down  considerably,\r\n\r\ntrade  and  services remained buoyant, accounting  for\r\n\r\nmore  than half of the increase in our Gross  Domestic\r\n\r\nProduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Healthy Balance of Payments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vulnerability to external influences has also\r\n\r\nbeen  lessened  by  our continuing  sound  balance  of\r\n\r\npayments  which  will enable us to  pay  for  the  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  we  need for both growth  and  consumption.\r\n\r\nFurther, our export-oriented industries, services  and\r\n\r\ntourism have all helped our balance of payments to end\r\n\r\nthe  year with a comfortable surplus. In spite of  the\r\n\r\nopenness  of  our  economy,  we  have  been  able   to\r\n\r\nimplement our monetary policies effectively  while  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time maintaining a high degree of  monetary\r\n\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Stable Employment</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these advantages, we have managed to maintain\r\n\r\nreasonably  full employment. As a result, unemployment\r\n\r\nso  far  has  not yet become serious. Of  a  total  of\r\n\r\n16,940  workers retrenched in 1974, 79%  were  females\r\n\r\nwho  were  mostly secondary wage earners and  only  3%\r\n\r\nwere skilled workers. Most of these retrenched workers\r\n\r\nmoreover have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfound  alternative employment, many in new industries.\r\n\r\nFor  1974,  a  total of ISO concerns  employing  9,030\r\n\r\npersons  were  registered as permanent  new  factories\r\n\r\ncompared  with 190 concerns employing I 1,140  persons\r\n\r\nin  1973.  As a result, our unemployment rate remained\r\n\r\nstable  at  4%.  In the meantime, employers  began  to\r\n\r\nlearn  how  to work equally well with less labour.  In\r\n\r\naddition,   there   is  now  less   job-hopping.   Our\r\n\r\nindustries are therefore leaner and more efficient. So\r\n\r\nfar we have been more fortunate compared to some major\r\n\r\nindustrial  countries where greater  unemployment  has\r\n\r\nresulted in considerable social strife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prospects for Singapore</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will Singapore fare in 1975 in the midst of\r\n\r\ninternational  uncertainties? Most economic  forecasts\r\n\r\nindicate  that the major industrialised economies  are\r\n\r\nunlikely  to achieve any significant upturn  until  at\r\n\r\nleast the second half of 1975. Taking into account the\r\n\r\nnormal  time lag before such economic revival  affects\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of the world, I would think that  a  marked\r\n\r\nimprovement   all   round  in   Singapore's   economic\r\n\r\ncondition  will not he apparent until the latter  part\r\n\r\nof  1975  or  even early 1976. However,  our  economic\r\n\r\nstructure, strengthened by the diversification of  our\r\n\r\nindustries  and services, should be able to withstand,\r\n\r\nas  in  the  past  year, the impact  of  some  further\r\n\r\nrecession  provided  the American  and  Western  world\r\n\r\neconomy does pick up by the first half of 1976 at  the\r\n\r\nlatest.  To  make assurance doubly sure, however,  the\r\n\r\nrecently appointed Economic Activation Committee  will\r\n\r\nspeed  up  the implementation of any anti-recessionary\r\n\r\nmeasures.  The  task  is therefore  one  of  designing\r\n\r\npolicies  that will help to get us out of the  present\r\n\r\nrecession  without too much suffering  while  pursuing\r\n\r\nand fulfilling our long-term economic objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Major Elements of Economic Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the present recession, we should stick to\r\n\r\nour  long-term objective of maintaining  a  relatively\r\n\r\nhigh  rate  of  growth.  We  should  consolidate   the\r\n\r\npolicies  of our Economic Strategy launched  in  1971.\r\n\r\nGrowth     should    still    he    spearheaded     by\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.  We should continue  also  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  services centre for technical  know-how,\r\n\r\ntourism  and finance. Similarly, we should  give  high\r\n\r\npriority  to the training of workers in skills  needed\r\n\r\nfor our future industries. Measures should, of course,\r\n\r\nhe  introduced to counter and mitigate the effects  of\r\n\r\nthe  present recession. But as far as possible,  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  should  be  in keeping  with  our  long-term\r\n\r\nstrategy.  We  should take advantage  of  the  present\r\n\r\nslack   conditions  to  prepare  for   full   economic\r\n\r\nrecovery.  High growth rates may still  be  achievable\r\n\r\nbecause  the  base from which we are climbing  is  low\r\n\r\ncompared to Japan, and also because Southeast Asia, as\r\n\r\na  whole,  may  well develop faster  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\nincreased oil prices, especially Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Industrial Development Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our industrial development policy would be to get\r\n\r\nindustries   to   increase   the   degree   of   local\r\n\r\nmanufacturing in their products by workers doing  more\r\n\r\nand  more skilled jobs. The success of the policy  can\r\n\r\nbe  measured by the value added by each worker in that\r\n\r\nindustry.  Investment commitments  for  the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears indicated a growing trend in the value added per\r\n\r\nworker  from  $14,000  in 1972  to  $32,000  in  1974,\r\n\r\nreflecting  the increasing sophistication  and  higher\r\n\r\nskills required of industries that would be set up  in\r\n\r\nthe near future. To meet the needs of such industries,\r\n\r\nwe   shall   have  to  make  sure  that  the  required\r\n\r\nfacilities  (land, utilities, buildings if  necessary)\r\n\r\nare   developed  and  readily  available.   Our   only\r\n\r\nrequirement should be that such facilities are put  to\r\n\r\nthe best use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of recession, there may be a greater need\r\n\r\nfor  financing on preferential terms. Our  efforts  to\r\n\r\npromote supporting industries would be helped by  such\r\n\r\nfinancing. I announced sometime ago a special fund  to\r\n\r\nassist skill-intensive industries bearing higher risks\r\n\r\nthan    those   normally   acceptable   to   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions. The Capital Assistance Scheme, for which\r\n\r\n$100  million has been provided in the Budget for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1975,  will be  administered  by  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board. The  assistance  to  such\r\n\r\nindustries  will include Government taking  up  shares\r\n\r\nwhich  the industrial venture partner can buy back  at\r\n\r\nhis  option, long-term loans or Government  guarantees\r\n\r\nfor  such  loans,  as well as shorter-term  loans  for\r\n\r\nworking capital. For other industries, long-term loans\r\n\r\nare   available   at  preferential  rates   from   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank of Singapore (DBS). In  addition,  a\r\n\r\nseparate  export  financing  scheme  with  an  initial\r\n\r\nprovision  of $100 million has also been  set  up  and\r\n\r\nadministered   by  the  DBS  to  assist   our   export\r\n\r\nindustries.  I  should, however, emphasise  that  such\r\n\r\nassistance  is given mainly to industries  which  have\r\n\r\nhigher  skills or technology and, as far as  possible,\r\n\r\nhave established markets and proven performance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to financial assistance, we shall be\r\n\r\nmaking  greater  efforts  to promote  investment.  The\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board has been reorganised to  do\r\n\r\nthis   more  vigorously.  Our  efforts  will  now   be\r\n\r\nconcentrated  where they should be, at the  investment\r\n\r\ncentres.  In addition to the nine centres  already  in\r\n\r\noperation,  two  more  promotion  centres  are   being\r\n\r\nestablished  in Houston and Copenhagen. These  centres\r\n\r\nwill  have  top-level staff and be directed  from  our\r\n\r\nheadquarters in New York to ensure proper attention to\r\n\r\nall investment inquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is also examining our tax incentives\r\n\r\nlegislation to see whether any additional incentive is\r\n\r\nrequired to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther  assist the promotion of desirable industries.\r\n\r\nOne  such area is the tax exemption period for pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus which in suitable cases may need to be extended\r\n\r\nfrom  the present five years to a maximum of 10 years.\r\n\r\nThis extension may make it sufficiently attractive  to\r\n\r\nindustries  to  set up here which require  substantial\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  have long gestation  periods  before\r\n\r\nprofitability can be achieved. It would also  help  to\r\n\r\nresolve  a  problem  of our present export  incentives\r\n\r\nscheme  which gives an export certificate  holder  the\r\n\r\ntax incentive when he exports his product but not when\r\n\r\nhe  sells  it  to a local manufacturer  who  needs  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  it  in an, export product.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  I  am  removing  the  $1  million  fixed  asset\r\n\r\nrequirement   for  pioneer  status   for   small   but\r\n\r\nespecially high quality product industries to  provide\r\n\r\nsupporting services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board has often been asked\r\n\r\nto  find  joint venture partners by both  foreign  and\r\n\r\nlocal  parties.  It will now establish  a  Bureau  for\r\n\r\nJoint  Ventures  which  will  collect  and  distribute\r\n\r\ninformation  to  interested parties  and  provide  all\r\n\r\nnecessary assistance for such joint-venture projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Export Promotion Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our present export promotion efforts need to be\r\n\r\nimproved  during this recessionary period when  demand\r\n\r\nthe  world over has declined substantially. First, our\r\n\r\nCommercial  Secretaries Service will  be  expanded  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  new  export markets can be  identified.  We\r\n\r\nalready have representatives in 13 countries. We shall\r\n\r\nstrengthen   the   existing   centres   through   more\r\n\r\nexperienced  staff  and set up centres  in  new  areas\r\n\r\nincluding  West Asia and Eastern Europe to assist  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  and traders to explore new  markets  by\r\n\r\nproviding them with information and contacts.  Second,\r\n\r\nthe Government has agreed in principle to establish an\r\n\r\nexport   credit   insurance   guarantee   scheme    in\r\n\r\nconjunction with the Banking and Insurance Community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetailed  discussions  on the  implementation  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme  are  now  being  held.  Third,  to  help   our\r\n\r\nexporters,  arrangements are now  being  finalised  to\r\n\r\nenable  banks  to  rediscount export  bills  with  the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority.  There  should  therefore  be   a\r\n\r\ncheaper  source of financing for exports.  Fourth,  we\r\n\r\nare   studying  various  ways  to  build  a   stronger\r\n\r\norganisation for export promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, our usual export promotion activities\r\n\r\nwill  continue.  These  include  the  organisation  of\r\n\r\nseminars  and  workshops on export promotion  for  our\r\n\r\nlocal  industries  as  well  as  the  organisation  of\r\n\r\nprivate  trade  missions and trade fairs.  It  is  our\r\n\r\nintention   to   encourage   a   greater   degree   of\r\n\r\nparticipation  from the private sector,  although  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  may  still  play a  leading  role  in  the\r\n\r\norganisation of such missions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Construction Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under world recessionary conditions, we shall step\r\n\r\nup  construction activity to offset the expected  fall\r\n\r\nin   output  and  employment  in  other  sectors.  New\r\n\r\nconstruction  will  also help to  meet  infrastructure\r\n\r\ndemands  when  the economy recovers fully.  The  major\r\n\r\nStatutory  Boards and Ministries will  press  on  with\r\n\r\ntheir  development  plans. For  financial  year  1975,\r\n\r\nPublic Sector Development Expenditure is programmed to\r\n\r\nincrease  by almost $1,290 million to $3,080  million.\r\n\r\nThe  Government's  direct development  expenditure  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to amount to $630.6 million, an increase  of\r\n\r\n$193.8   million  over  the  previous  year.   Special\r\n\r\nemphasis will he placed on the provision of industrial\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, utilities, transport and communication\r\n\r\nand housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for private sector construction, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  so  far introduced two measures to stimulate  it.\r\n\r\nBanks  are  now allowed to include, for up  to  2%  of\r\n\r\ntheir statutory liquidity reserve requirements,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namounts  lent  on  mortgages of  new  properties.  The\r\n\r\nrestriction   on   the  purchase  of   properties   by\r\n\r\nforeigners has also been amended to allow them to  buy\r\n\r\nflats and apartments in buildings of not less than six\r\n\r\nstoreys.  This  in practice means the  more  expensive\r\n\r\napartments  for  which there is less demand  by  local\r\n\r\nresidents.  Private developers should play their  part\r\n\r\nto  stimulate demand by lowering the present  property\r\n\r\nprices which appear to be still excessive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Monetary Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the coming year, monetary policy will continue\r\n\r\nto  be directed at maintaining monetary stability  and\r\n\r\nthe   promotion   of   economic   growth.   Our   main\r\n\r\ninstruments,   the  variation  of  the  minimum   cash\r\n\r\nbalance,  which  banks and finance companies  have  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  with the Monetary Authority, and adjustments\r\n\r\nin  interest  rates  will continue to  play  important\r\n\r\nroles.  The  development of Singapore as  a  financial\r\n\r\ncentre will continue to receive special attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manpower Development Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now make a few remarks on our manpower\r\n\r\ntraining  which  is  by  its  nature,  long-term.  Our\r\n\r\neconomic  strategy  recognises the  need  to  increase\r\n\r\nskills  in our labour force, to assist us in promoting\r\n\r\nindustries requiring more skills, as well as  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  best  use  of  our workforce.  We  should  expand\r\n\r\ntraining   and   re-training   programmes   during   a\r\n\r\nrecession,  when workers will be less fully  employed.\r\n\r\nWe  should use this vacant period in the lives of  our\r\n\r\nworkers  for  more  industrial training  so  that  our\r\n\r\nlabour  force  will be ready for more qualified  tasks\r\n\r\nwhen the economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a start, the Industrial Training Board has\r\n\r\nincreased  its industrial training capacity. Enrolment\r\n\r\nin  1975 is up at 6,890 from 5,150 in 1974. The number\r\n\r\nwill be further increased later this year when we take\r\n\r\nin more trainees. Training\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be improved in quality by lengthening the training period and changing the course content to meet future industrial needs. Private sector training will be similarly improved by better use ofour Joint Industrial Training Centres. In addition to the present two centres, with RolIei and TATA, the third Joint Industrial Training Centre with Philips will begin training by July 1975. The Government has provided $10.5 million for industrial training in 1975. Of this, $8.5 million will be for more industrial grants and Joint Industrial Training Centres and $1.9 million will be used to send trainees overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aim in our manpower training is to change work\r\n\r\nattitudes.  For  the higher skill industries,  workers\r\n\r\nmust  be prepared for longer and more intense training\r\n\r\nperiods. Our workers must increase their productivity,\r\n\r\nthrough higher skills which can only come by hard work\r\n\r\nand   diligence.  We  can  continue  to  achieve  more\r\n\r\neconomic progress only if our workers are prepared  to\r\n\r\ntackle  difficult  tasks with greater  \"value  added\",\r\n\r\nrather  than go for \"cushy jobs\". The ultimate  limits\r\n\r\nto our productivity are the technological standards we\r\n\r\ncan  achieve,  which in turn means  the  standards  of\r\n\r\ntechnological skills our workers are prepared to exert\r\n\r\nthemselves to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote industries requiring more skills, better\r\n\r\nwage  rates  will be paid by these desired industries.\r\n\r\nWage  increases must, wherever possible, be pegged  to\r\n\r\nproductivity. Employers should, therefore, continue to\r\n\r\nimprove  their methods of working, to use less  labour\r\n\r\nby   putting   in   more  equipment   and   machinery.\r\n\r\nProductivity increases depend as much on workers as on\r\n\r\nemployers.  Both sides must play their parts  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  plans to establish more skill  intensive\r\n\r\nand higher value added industries in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks on Economic Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our anti-recessionary measures within the coming\r\n\r\nyear would probably have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninflationary  effects. To counter these  effects,  we\r\n\r\nhave some spare capacity at present for production  to\r\n\r\nmeet  any  additional demand for goods  and  services.\r\n\r\nDeclining  world demand has meant generally stable  or\r\n\r\nlower  prices  for  most  raw materials  required  for\r\n\r\nproduction. By buying our raw materials from  as  many\r\n\r\nsources as possible, we can in any case ensure that we\r\n\r\nbuy   where  we  are  the  least  affected  by   price\r\n\r\nincreases. The Government will also continue to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  insofar  as  the domestic sector  is  concerned,\r\n\r\nthere will be as little profiteering as possible.  Our\r\n\r\npeople  should also conscientiously cut  out  wasteful\r\n\r\nconsumption.  The  aim is for our economy  to  recover\r\n\r\nfrom  recession  without setting off another  bout  of\r\n\r\ninflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In taking anti-recessionary measures, we shall at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  keep to our long-term objectives  and\r\n\r\npolicies.  We  have  the advantage  of  a  diversified\r\n\r\neconomy.  Next  our  sound foreign  exchange  reserves\r\n\r\nposition. We should still be able to achieve  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth,  though probably at a lower rate than  in  the\r\n\r\nyears 1969-1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The FY 1975 Budget</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the Budget Estimates for the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1975-76.  These  should  be  examined\r\n\r\nagainst  the  economic  background  discussed  in  the\r\n\r\nEconomic    Survey    and   my   preceding    remarks.\r\n\r\nTraditionally,  the  Budget  outlines  the  Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the year against its expected  revenue\r\n\r\nand   upon  Parliamentary  sanction,  remains  as  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  document for the financial year. The  Budget,\r\n\r\nhowever, also plays an increasingly important role  as\r\n\r\nan instrument of economic policy. Budget proposals not\r\n\r\nonly  reflect the requirements of Government business.\r\n\r\nThey  can  also  respond to needs and changes  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  Thus,  the  Budget for  FY  75  is  counter-recessionary  in  its allocation  of  more  funds  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  purposes. At the  same  time,  its  usual\r\n\r\nrestraint on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecurrent  expenditure  can  be  exercised   also   to\r\n\r\nincrease productivity in Government operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total provision for recurrent expenditure in FY\r\n\r\n75 under the Main Estimates, excluding the transfer of\r\n\r\n$500  million  to  the Development Fund,  is  $2,146.3\r\n\r\nmillion. This has increased by\r\n\r\n$326.8  million or 18 per cent over the provision  for\r\n\r\nFY  74. The increase is spread between Other Operating\r\n\r\nExpenditure   accounting   for   $220   million    and\r\n\r\nExpenditure on Manpower accounting for $106.8 million,\r\n\r\nThe   need  for  the  increased  provision  for  Other\r\n\r\nOperating Expenditure is due to the increasing  volume\r\n\r\nof  Government business and the general rise in prices\r\n\r\nof supplies and materials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Manpower costs, the main reason for\r\n\r\nthe  increase  is the National Wage Council  award  in\r\n\r\n1974 and the consequent increase in CPF contributions.\r\n\r\nThese  alone  account for $86 million. To offset  this\r\n\r\nsizeable increase in Manpower costs, stringent control\r\n\r\nhas been exercised over increases in new .posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have continually exhorted the private sector to\r\n\r\nincrease   productivity  to  improve  our  competitive\r\n\r\nposition  in  the international market. Mindful  of  a\r\n\r\nsimilar need for productivity in the public service, I\r\n\r\nhave asked my Ministry to place continued emphasis  on\r\n\r\ndeveloping  greater  administrative  skills,  adopting\r\n\r\ninnovative   ideas,  improving  work  procedures   and\r\n\r\nmethods,  and making greater use of machines  wherever\r\n\r\npracticable. Admittedly, productivity is not as easily\r\n\r\nmeasurable in certain services as it is in others. But\r\n\r\nto   enhance  efficiency  and  performance,  a  simple\r\n\r\nprinciple  is  to insist always on output  of  a  high\r\n\r\nquality.   Manpower  increases  have  been   supported\r\n\r\nselectively  and only in cases where  the  needs  have\r\n\r\nbeen clearly demonstrated. Such increases have, by and\r\n\r\nlarge, been confined to Ministries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Departments  with  major  development  programmes\r\n\r\nunder implementation. As a result, the net increase in\r\n\r\nthe  permanent establishment for FY 75 including those\r\n\r\nposts  created by Establishment Warrants during FY  74\r\n\r\nhas  been  kept  down to 1,689 posts or  2.7%  of  the\r\n\r\nestablishment level in FY 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the total provision in the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  has  been  allowed to  grow  from  $1,561.6\r\n\r\nmillion  in  FY 74 to $2,188.2 million in  FY  75,  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  4O.l%. This emphasis  on  development  I\r\n\r\nearlier  indicated as being responsive  to  needs  and\r\n\r\nchanges in the economy in the Budget's increasing role\r\n\r\nas an instrument of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory boards and Government companies providing\r\n\r\nthe   main   thrust   of  development   and   economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructural activities take up more  than  70%  of\r\n\r\nthe provisions under the Development Estimates. Direct\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure by Government Ministries  and\r\n\r\nDepartments also show a substantial increase of $193.8\r\n\r\nmillion  or 44.4%. Such increases are consistent  with\r\n\r\nthe   policy   of   accelerating  public   development\r\n\r\nactivities during the recession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation of funds is, however, only the first\r\n\r\nstep  in the development programme. The more important\r\n\r\nstep  is to get the accelerated programme implemented.\r\n\r\nThis  will  be the concern of the Economic  Activation\r\n\r\nCommittee  which  has been recently set  up  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before passing on to the next part of my Statement,\r\n\r\nI should like to comment briefly on the presentational\r\n\r\nchanges  that have been incorporated in the  Estimates\r\n\r\ndocuments.   Honourable   Members   are   aware   that\r\n\r\nimprovements have been made to the Estimates format in\r\n\r\nthe   last  two  Budgets.  Further  to  these  earlier\r\n\r\nefforts, my officers have introduced more improvements\r\n\r\nwhich   rationalise  the  way  in   which   Heads   of\r\n\r\nExpenditure are established. Each\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  now given only one Head of  Expenditure,\r\n\r\nthereby  facilitating  inter-Ministry  comparisons  of\r\n\r\ntotal allocations. The subhead codes have been refined\r\n\r\nto  enable  Government Expenditure  to  be  classified\r\n\r\naccording  to  the economic impact of the expenditure.\r\n\r\nThese changes should provide useful information to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  data  bank  and enable  a  more  effective\r\n\r\nevaluation   to   be  made  of  the   efficiency   and\r\n\r\nutilisation of our monetary allocations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these improvements in presentation, the\r\n\r\nTreasury  Memorandum on the Estimates  which  must  be\r\n\r\nconsidered part of the Budget documents has also  been\r\n\r\nimproved  in coverage and analysis of each  Ministry's\r\n\r\ntotal  expenditure. As it also explains in detail  the\r\n\r\nprovisions under each Head of Expenditure, it makes it\r\n\r\nunnecessary  for me to repeat in this  Statement  what\r\n\r\nhas already been said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury Memorandum also shows in detail how the\r\n\r\nrevised  yield  from individual items of  revenue  has\r\n\r\nvaried  from  the estimated yield in FY  74.  It  also\r\n\r\nshows the yield we expect in FY\r\n\r\n75.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated revenue of $2,647.5 million for\r\n\r\nFY 75 represents a meager 5% increase over the revised\r\n\r\nestimate  for  FY 74. Revenue in FY 73 was  27%  above\r\n\r\nthat in FY 72, and in FY 74 it was 13.6% above revenue\r\n\r\nin  FY  73. Members will note the appreciable slowdown\r\n\r\nin the rate of growth of revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated recurrent expenditure of $2,646.3\r\n\r\nmillion  for  FY  75 is 6\u00bd% higher  than  the  revised\r\n\r\nfigure for FY 74. It includes the $500 million which I\r\n\r\npropose to transfer to the Development Fun d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the $500 million to be transferred from\r\n\r\nthe  Consolidated Fund, the Development Fund  will  be\r\n\r\naugmented by the proceeds of new loans, both  domestic\r\n\r\nand foreign, which I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npropose raising in the coming year. The Fund will also\r\n\r\nbenefit  from investment income and from repayment  of\r\n\r\nloans  made to statutory boards and companies  in  the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, the estimated development expenditure of\r\n\r\n$2,188  million, which is 60% higher than the  revised\r\n\r\nfigure  for FY 74, will exceed what is available  from\r\n\r\nall  these sources by $245 million. This then  is  the\r\n\r\ngap that has to be bridged, partly by new taxation and\r\n\r\npartly by a drawdown from the Development Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Taxation Policy and Changes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have on many occasions, and in previous budget\r\n\r\nstatements,  stressed  that it  was  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  to give priority to economic growth, which  in\r\n\r\nturn would bring increased revenues to finance growing\r\n\r\npublic expenditure. At the same time, we would improve\r\n\r\nour  tax  collection machinery so as to  maximise  the\r\n\r\nyield from existing taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have referred to the marked slowdown in the rate\r\n\r\nof growth of revenue since FY 73. In the coming fiscal\r\n\r\nyear, recurrent expenditure is expected to increase by\r\n\r\n6\u00bd%  as against a growth of only 5% in revenue. We are\r\n\r\nalso approaching the effective limit for improving the\r\n\r\ncollection  machinery. Beyond this limit,  expenditure\r\n\r\non  further improvements will not yield a commensurate\r\n\r\nincrease  in  revenue. We thus have to  introduce  new\r\n\r\ntaxes  or increase the rates of existing taxes in  the\r\n\r\ncoming fiscal year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided against introducing any new taxes for\r\n\r\nthe time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for increases to existing taxes, at a time when\r\n\r\nrising  world prices are forcing a reduction,  or,  at\r\n\r\nbest,   preventing  any  improvement,  in  our  living\r\n\r\nstandards, I am reluctant to increase taxation lest it\r\n\r\nshould  raise  the  prices  of  essential  goods   and\r\n\r\nservices,   especially  food  and   clothing,   public\r\n\r\ntransport and housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So additional revenue will have to come from\r\n\r\nincreased taxes on tobacco, liquor and cars, not basic\r\n\r\nto life for the average family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware of the various measures introduced\r\n\r\nby   the  Government  over  the  last  few  years   to\r\n\r\ndiscourage  smoking. During calendar  year  1974,  the\r\n\r\ntotal  consumption  of cigarettes showed  no  increase\r\n\r\nover  1973  hut there was a marked shift  of  consumer\r\n\r\npreference  in  favour of the more expensive  imported\r\n\r\nbrands.  The  duty on tobacco and cigarettes  will  he\r\n\r\nincreased, with immediate effect, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Per Kilogram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        From     To\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaf  tobacco           $29.10   $32.00\r\n\r\nImported cigarettes\t$32.50   $38.00\r\n\r\nLocally manufactured \r\n\r\ncigarettes              $ 3.00   $ 3.50\r\n\r\nPipe tobacco            $25.40   $28.00\r\n\r\nCut rag                 $27.60   $30.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>                      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAllowing  for  a  possible drop in consumption,  which\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  unwelcome,  the  increased  duties  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  yield additional revenue  of  about  $9\u00ab\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs and excise duties on liquors will also he\r\n\r\nincreased. On beer and stout, the customs duty will be\r\n\r\nincreased by 15% and the excise duty by 8%. On  brandy\r\n\r\nand  whisky, the customs duty will he increased by 3%.\r\n\r\nFull details of the increases will be announced by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  later today. Additional revenue expected  is\r\n\r\nabout $6 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Annual Licence Fee (or road tax) on petrol-driven motor vehicles, including station wagons, will\r\n\r\nbe revised with immediate effect as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Revised     Old\r\n\r\n                        rate        rate\r\n\r\n                        per cc      per cc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1000 cc and under       20 cts      14 cts\r\n\r\n1001 cc to 1600 cc      25 cts      17 cts\r\n\r\n1601 cc to 2000 cc      30 cts      22 cts\r\n\r\n2001 cc to 3000 cc      40 cts      35 cts\r\n\r\n3001 cc and above       65 cts      60 cts\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus,  a  3000  cc  car will now  have  its  road  tax\r\n\r\nincreased  by $150 from $105O per annum to $1,200  per\r\n\r\nannum  as against the 1000 cc car which will have  its\r\n\r\ntax  increased by $60 from $140 per annum to $200  per\r\n\r\nannum.  Private hire cars will also be taxed  on  this\r\n\r\nbasis,  but  there will be no change in the  road  tax\r\n\r\npayable  on  taxis. Cars registered  in  the  name  of\r\n\r\ncompanies  will be taxed at twice the rate  applicable\r\n\r\nto  those owned by individuals. Diesel tax on  private\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicles  based on six times the  road  tax  on\r\n\r\npetrol-engine  vehicles will increase proportionately.\r\n\r\nIn addition, under income tax legislation, the capital\r\n\r\nallowance  allowed for company cars  registered  after\r\n\r\ntoday will be restricted to a maximum of $15000. There\r\n\r\nwill,   however,  be  no  change  in  the   Additional\r\n\r\nRegistration  Fee  on new vehicles, whether  owned  by\r\n\r\nindividuals or companies. Additional expected is about\r\n\r\n$26 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases I have announced will yield additional\r\n\r\nrevenue  of  only  S4l.5  million,  compared  to   the\r\n\r\nexpected deficit on the Development Estimates of  $245\r\n\r\nmillion. Four-fifths of the deficit will thus have  to\r\n\r\nbe financed by drawdowns from the Development Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As against these tax increases, perhaps Members will\r\n\r\nwelcome  the  slight tax concession I now  propose  to\r\n\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our rapid economic development in the last few\r\n\r\nyears, it has become apparent that we need our skilled\r\n\r\nand  experienced people to go on working beyond  their\r\n\r\nnormal   retirement   age.  And  our   equally   rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment in medical facilities has made our  people\r\n\r\ncapable  of  working  beyond 55  years  old,  the  old\r\n\r\nretiring age or even 60, the new retiring age. But  it\r\n\r\nmust be recognised that such people will need to spend\r\n\r\nmore  money staying healthy and getting to work.  With\r\n\r\neffect  from  the 1976 year of assessment,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  earned income relief will be increased  from  the\r\n\r\npresent $1,000 to $2,000 for those over 55 years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nold and to $3,000 for those over 60 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the cost of this tax concession\r\n\r\nwill be some $4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like, in conclusion of my\r\n\r\nremarks on the financial policy of the Government  for\r\n\r\nthe  financial  year 1975, to stress  once  again  the\r\n\r\ncrucial  importance of worker-management  co-operation\r\n\r\nand  their  working  in  with Government  policies  to\r\n\r\nensure  Singapore's continued progress and prosperity.\r\n\r\nIf  our efforts are united, we should be able to  face\r\n\r\nthis troubled future with cautious optimism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That\r\n\r\nParliament  approves  the  financial  policy  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the financial year 1st April, 1975  to\r\n\r\n31st March, 1976.\" In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccordance with paragraph (I) of Standing Order  No.\r\n\r\n84, the debate now stands adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hon, debate to be resumed on\r\n\r\nwhat day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> On 17th March, 1975, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Monday, 17th\r\n\r\nMarch, l975.\"-[Mr Jek Yeun Thong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty-five minutes to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Four o'clock p.m, to Monday, 17th March, 1975.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1975/19750303/19750303-HA-0340195.pdf\"\">Appendix - ECONOMIC SURVEY OF SINGAPORE, 1974 (Cols 195-356)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
