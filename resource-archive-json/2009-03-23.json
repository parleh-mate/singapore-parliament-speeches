FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B>&nbsp; Sir, the Special Risk Initiative (SRI) announced in Budget 2009 has significantly enhanced the Government's existing loan schemes to help companies.&nbsp; The SRI has facilitated continued lending by banks to viable companies, which had enjoyed credit lines on commercial terms during good times, but were now facing the danger of reduced credit.&nbsp; Banks have tightened credit lines on account of heightened risk aversion during this period of uncertainty, or perceptions of weaker short-term business prospects facing the companies.&nbsp; Allowing banks to transfer commercial credit lines to the new Bridging Loan Programme reduces the pullback of such funding and allows these companies to continue meeting their business financing needs.&nbsp; Disallowing such line transfers would result in significantly reduced credit for these companies.&nbsp; Financial institutions would, however, do well to comprehensively assess the overall long-term banking relationship with the client company, before deciding whether there is a need to curtail existing commercial credit lines, or to supplement or transfer part of the line to a Government loan scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Seah Kian Peng also asked for an update on the overall credit situation. &nbsp;Data collected by MAS indicates that the total amount of outstanding commercial non-bank Singapore dollar-loans has fallen by about 4%, from a peak of $163.2 billion in October 2008, to $156.8 billion in January 2009.&nbsp; The month-on-month rate of reduction has, however, eased from 2.2% between October 2008 and November 2008, to 0.65% between December 2008 and January 2009.&nbsp; This overall reduction in commercial loans is reflective of the more difficult business conditions, and was also seen in previous economic downturns.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Also, would the Ministry be concerned&nbsp;if many banks are indeed asking their clients to switch over from their existing loans to this new package, what it means to the businesses and whether the Ministry itself is taking a proactive approach in understanding the extent of the situation?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we have to go back to the fundamentals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government set up this Special Risk Initiative in order to help our companies and, therefore, we want to be as facilitative as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, of course, we cannot be granting blank cheques to all our companies.&nbsp; So there has to be a balance.&nbsp; On balance, I think we have taken a more facilitative approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not have the specific number of the bank transfer loans because the banks, in evaluating the credit needs of the companies, may just extend part and may supplement with the Government loans or may terminate the loans.&nbsp; So there is no clear basis for collecting the data.&nbsp; What I can say is that from the indication that we had&nbsp;previously, the Government loan schemes that we extended were&nbsp;less than $100 million per month in 2008, so that over the year we extended about $1 billion.&nbsp; For the first three months of this year, our average loan approval rate exceeds $300 million.&nbsp; So it is already more than three times what&nbsp;we approved and disbursed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It shows that we are trying to be helpful and we are extending the loans.&nbsp; Of course, we have to be careful that the banks do not just transfer all their bad loans to the Government schemes.&nbsp; And here, we are in constant dialogue with the banks.&nbsp; Both MAS and IE Singapore follow the banks' classification of loans closely.&nbsp; And if the loan is already a non-performing loan, then, of course, the bank cannot transfer the loan </p> <p align=left>Column: 3318<p><p>to the Government schemes.&nbsp; But, on the whole, our attitude is that we try to be as facilitative as possible, and we need to strike this balance.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng --><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Seah Kian Peng:</B>&nbsp; Sir, just one other supplementary question.&nbsp; I agree that indeed this package is meant to help the businesses.&nbsp; Does the Ministry contemplate that there could be a situation where every loan&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;good or bad loan&nbsp;&ndash; is transferred from the financial institution's existing portfolio into this scheme?&nbsp; And if it does, are we allowing this to happen?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B>&nbsp; Sir, in our discussions with the banks, I think the banks understand the objective of the Government schemes.&nbsp; We do have a close audit of all the loans.&nbsp; We also have a general rule which we extend to the banks&nbsp;&ndash; that we do not expect to see more than 30% of refinancing loans.&nbsp; So 70% will be new loans extended to our companies.&nbsp; This is in the spirit of why the Government has these credit schemes in the first place&nbsp;&ndash; to be able to generate new credit facilities for our companies.&nbsp; It is with this understanding that we work closely with all the financial institutions.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:RETURNS ON RESERVES AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> &nbsp; Sir, Mr Gautam Banerjee asked about the additional amounts available for Government spending for year ended 31st March 2009 and&nbsp;year ending 31st March 2010 under the new Constitutional framework for spending from investment returns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new framework for spending will take effect from 1st April 2009.&nbsp; It, hence, does not affect the amount of investment income taken into the Budget for spending for the fiscal year ending 31st March 2009, which continues to be based on the earlier framework of actual interest and dividend income alone.&nbsp; For this fiscal year which is ending soon, the Government took in a Net Investment Income Contribution of $3.7 billion.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the coming fiscal year ending 31st March 2010, the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) was estimated in the Budget to amount to $7.7 billion.&nbsp; The figure was reflected in the Budget Statement in January 2009.&nbsp; Compared to the Net Investment Income Contribution</p> <p align=left>Column: 3320<p><p>taken in last year under the old framework, the NIRC of $7.7 billion is an increase of about $4 billion, or about 1.6% of GDP.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would know that this Net Investment Returns Contribution starting with the coming fiscal year is based on the new framework of spending out of long-term expected real returns, not limited to interest and dividends.&nbsp; The framework applies to expected returns on the reserves managed by GIC and MAS.&nbsp; There is no change in rules for spending out of Temasek's returns, which continue to be based on actual dividends.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process for determining the long-term expected real rates of return of the reserves invested by GIC and MAS has been rigorous.&nbsp; The rates, which refer to the expected real returns over the next 20 years, were proposed by the Boards of GIC and MAS respectively, based on detailed study and assessments by investment professionals in the two agencies.&nbsp; The GIC and MAS teams first projected the expected returns on each individual asset class, such as bonds or real estate.&nbsp; This was followed by aggregating the expected rates of return on the individual asset classes into the overall rates of return on the GIC and MAS portfolios, which take into account their respective asset allocation strategies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GIC and MAS took into account both historical trends and a forward-looking analysis of the investment outlook, before reaching their best judgments.&nbsp; The methodology did not in any instance involve a mechanical extrapolation of past trends.&nbsp; In making their assessments, they also took into account projections of future returns on each asset class by their peers amongst institutional investors.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance undertook a thorough review of the methodologies used by the GIC and MAS, and was </p> <p align=left>Column: 3321<p><p>satisfied that their approach was sound and the estimated long-term rates of return were reasonable.&nbsp; As Minister for Finance, I therefore proposed these rates to the President for the purpose of Budget 2009.&nbsp; The President obtained the advice of the Council of Presidential Advisers, as required under the Constitution, before concurring with the Government's proposals.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Banerjee asked how the expected long-term real rate of return compared with the actual historical long-term real rate of return.&nbsp; The expected rates of return&nbsp;&ndash; to repeat what I mentioned earlier, which are estimates of the average returns expected over the next 20 years&nbsp;&ndash; reflected the GIC and MAS Boards' assessment that the future investment environment is likely to be less benign than that over the last 20 years.&nbsp; The expected rates of return for the individual asset classes over the next 20 years are, in fact, generally lower than the historical rates.&nbsp; However, the expected rates on GIC's overall portfolio also reflect the fact that it is now considerably more diversified across a range of risk assets than it was 20 years ago.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We spend a lot of time on this.&nbsp; First and foremost, within the GIC and the MAS&nbsp;&ndash; professional staff and the boards.&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance gets into a fair level of detail in assessing the methodology&nbsp;&ndash; we are not professional experts but we have got to make sure that the methodologies are sound and are comparable with the best practices in the investment world. The President, advised by the Council of Presidential Advisers, does an independent check on the methodologies so as to assure himself that the final proposals are sound.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not a science.&nbsp; It involves judgment, and this is judgment principally on the part of seasoned investment professionals.&nbsp; The best way of ensuring that the system is robust is to ensure these internal processes of governance, first, of putting professional expertise into play; second, internal governance within the GIC and MAS; third, the Ministry of Finance doing its own due diligence on the methodologies used; fourth, the Council of Presidential Advisers taking an independent look and advising the President; and, finally, the President deciding on whether to approve the Government's proposals.&nbsp; That is really the basis of our system.&nbsp; But I am sure the GIC will, in its annual reports in future, give a flavour of its thinking on the investment environment going forward.&nbsp; It has done so in its last annual report and I am sure, going forward, it will also provide a feel for its thinking on how the investment environment is likely to shape up.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION-<!--END_COL_TITLE:UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION:::3328--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In December 2008, those with below secondary education formed the largest group, totalling 21,300 and constituting 31% amongst the unemployed.&nbsp; Sixteen thousand-two hundred or 23% of the unemployed had secondary education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Six&nbsp;thousand-four hundred&nbsp;or 9% were diploma holders while&nbsp;14,800 or 21% were degree holders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On age profile, workers aged 40 and above continued to form the largest group totalling 30,300 or 43% among the unemployed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen thousand-seven hundred&nbsp;or 23% were aged between 30&nbsp;and 39 while 23,900 or 34% were aged below 30.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are increasingly more PMETs affected by this recession, partly due to their increasing proportion in our workforce.&nbsp; For the whole of 2008, 6,200 PMETs were made redundant, forming 37% of the workers displaced, up from 31% in the year before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM and WDA have been working closely with the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and the Employment and Employability Institute or e2i on a range of measures to help retrenched workers and the unemployed find jobs.&nbsp; Both e2i and </p> <p align=left>Column: 3324<p><p>WDA work with companies conducting retrenchment exercises to render assistance to retrenched workers to find new jobs.&nbsp; The Career Centres at the CDCs and NTUC's e2i provide a comprehensive&nbsp;suite of services, ranging from training and counselling to job matching for the job seekers.&nbsp; They cater to both rank and file as well as PMET job seekers under SPUR and the Professional Skills Programme announced recently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at end of February 2009, over 43,000 workers have been committed for SPUR training, including about 17,000 individuals who have signed up for SPUR courses at CET centres, ITEs and the&nbsp;five polytechnics.&nbsp; About one-third of these individuals are PMETs who signed up for training for jobs in the creative industries, community and social services, finance, landscape, process and manufacturing, tourism and educational services.&nbsp; In 2008, an estimated 13,300 unemployed locals found jobs through the assistance of the CDC Career Centres.&nbsp; This year will be more challenging but our Career Centres are gearing up to do more for the unemployed Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we can expect job losses in the externally-orientated sectors, there are still opportunities in other sectors, such as construction, pharmaceuticals, health care, education, public administration, tourism, and so on, which are still hiring.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be at least 45,000 new jobs available over the next&nbsp;two years.&nbsp; This includes more than 20,000 jobs at the two Integrated Resorts; 18,000 jobs in the public sector; and some 6,000 from the pipeline of new investments, including 1,200 in clean technology and 900 in biomedical sciences.&nbsp; Many of these jobs are PMET jobs.&nbsp; There will also be new jobs in the retail, F&amp;B and hospitality industries with the opening of new malls and hotels; as well as in the construction, security, childcare and interactive digital media industries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 3325<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we work with our tripartite partners to save jobs and help the unemployed find jobs, it is also important for us to continue to bring in new jobs.&nbsp; Therefore, we have to ensure that Singapore remains an attractive place for business and investments and our workforce remains competitive and flexible.&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, we can continue to create more opportunities for Singaporeans.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But it is also important for us to re-emphasise the need for them to go through training.&nbsp; As many of these workers have been in the same employment for many years, now that they have to switch jobs&nbsp;and&nbsp;look for new jobs, it is important to make sure we find ways to enhance their employability.&nbsp; There are many basic employment skills&nbsp;which some of the jobseekers do not possess.&nbsp; So I will encourage these jobseekers to approach our CDC Career Centres&nbsp;or they can approach e2i under NTUC.&nbsp;&nbsp;The career counsellors there will then be able to help these jobseekers more specifically &ndash;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first answer the first question on obstacles to employment.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, I think the challenges faced by PMETs and the rank and file are quite different and we need to address them differently. From our experience, we find that some of the jobseekers really do not possess basic employability skills and we need to train them,&nbsp;and to help them acquire these skills.&nbsp; Some of the jobseekers may need to be prepared to switch industry because the industry they were in was no longer growing so they have to look for opportunities in other industries.&nbsp; This conversion process will also take sometime and we will continue to help them to do so.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also jobseekers who are less flexible and we need to help them and encourage them to be more flexible.&nbsp; I will just give&nbsp;Members an example.&nbsp; I think we read in the newspapers over the weekend that the bus companies are looking for bus captains and bus leaders.&nbsp; They have, I think, 280 vacancies, 220 applied and only 77 turned up for interview.&nbsp; I think jobs are still available at different levels and different categories of jobs.&nbsp; If we are</p> <p align=left>Column: 3328<p><p>more flexible, we will encourage our jobseekers to be more&nbsp;flexible and we will be able to help them find jobs faster.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the second question on unemployment rate, I have mentioned repeatedly that rather than focusing on projection and estimate, it is more important for MOM, our various agencies and&nbsp;tripartite partners to focus on the ground on helping individual jobseekers find jobs.&nbsp; So we have been working together through Jobs Credit as well as through the SPUR programme to minimise job losses. Whenever there are job losses, we find different ways to help those that are affected so that they can find jobs faster, and we also work together to give them training and upgrade so as to enhance their employability.&nbsp; I think this is the focus of the Ministry.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND FOREIGN MANPOWER--><p align=left>Column: 3328<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND FOREIGN MANPOWER:::3334--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND FOREIGN MANPOWER</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; <B>Mrs Josephine Teo</B> asked the Acting Minister for Manpower (a) how has the economic downturn impacted the number of foreigners in the workforce; and (b) whether the Ministry will review the need to fine-tune our policies on foreign manpower in light of the downturn.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B>&nbsp; Sir, with the recession and falling demand for workers, the number of foreign workers will naturally go down.&nbsp; Foreigners' share of redundancies in 2008 was roughly in line with the proportion of foreigners in our workforce. The impact of foreign workers is likely to be felt more in sectors like manufacturing than in other sectors&nbsp;like construction which still has several projects on hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned in Parliament during the Committee of Supply (COS) debate, MOM&nbsp;will fine-tune our regulatory framework to improve the skills and quality of our foreign workforce.&nbsp; I mentioned that we will raise the criteria</p> <p align=left>Column: 3329<p><p>for S Pass to improve the quality of S Pass workers coming here. We have also reviewed the qualifying criteria for skilled work permit holders to ensure that only better skilled and better qualified workers will benefit from the lower tier of levy for skilled workers.&nbsp; We will brief the various industries on these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, faced with the&nbsp;downturn, some may think that by sending one foreign worker home, one more job will be created for Singaporean workers.&nbsp; This is not necessarily the case.&nbsp; Sending foreign workers home may mean losing the business altogether and all the Singaporean jobs along with it.&nbsp; Instead, it is far better to help Singaporean workers become more cost competitive and resilient so that they are more attractive to the employers and they can take advantage of the opportunities still available.&nbsp; The Government's&nbsp;assistance has been significant.&nbsp; The Resilience Package, which includes SPUR, Jobs Credit and WIS Special Payment, will help companies cut costs, remain viable and save jobs.&nbsp; It will help Singaporean workers to re-skill and up-skill so that they are better able to retain their jobs and&nbsp;to find new jobs.&nbsp; It will also&nbsp;build new capabilities in our economy to prepare for the recovery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in summary, even as we address the short-term challenges of the downturn, we should not undermine our competitive advantage of a flexible labour market.&nbsp; Singapore has to remain an attractive place for businesses in order to retain those which are here and to continue to attract new investments&nbsp;and bring in more and better jobs for Singaporeans.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for his explanation.&nbsp; Non-Singaporeans comprise about one-third of our workforce and </p> <p align=left>Column: 3330<p>  <p><p>as the Minister has acknowledged, job losses have mainly come from the manufacturing sector where the proportion of non-Singaporeans in the workforce is proportionally higher, so I would have expected that&nbsp;redundancies attributed to non-Singaporeans would be proportionally higher than one-third.&nbsp; This does not appear to be the case.&nbsp; Could the Minister please explain why?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two more questions.&nbsp; One is&nbsp;on the tightening of the S Pass criteria.&nbsp; Could I ask the Minister whether&nbsp;he would also consider not just&nbsp;tightening the criteria but also looking at the level?&nbsp; In other words, looking at the quota that is being allowed under S Passes,&nbsp;I would like to know whether the number of S Pass holders in Singapore has been lowered proportionally as our economy has shrunk.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir,&nbsp;let me thank the Member for the questions.&nbsp; The proportion of foreign workers versus local workers being retrenched or being made redundant depends to a very large extent on the sectors that are affected, as Members have pointed out.&nbsp; In particular where services and banking sectors are concerned, I think by and large they are manned by local workers and therefore whenever these sectors are affected, we tend to see local workers being affected.&nbsp; In the manufacturing sector, for example, we see a mix of local and foreign workers.&nbsp; We also have to take into consideration that for some of these foreign workers, their contracts were not renewed.&nbsp; Redundancy only takes into account contracts that are terminated prematurely.&nbsp; So we have to take all these factors into account.&nbsp; I would advise Members to take these numbers with a pinch of salt, and&nbsp;try to understand the factors that are affecting retrenchment process rather than looking at the numbers coldly.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, with regard to the question on foreign worker quota, as I mentioned in</p>  <p align=left>Column: 3331<p>  <p>my reply, it is important for us to ensure our economy remains robust, vibrant and flexible so that we will continue to attract new investments.&nbsp; It is important for us not to send the wrong signal to the investors,otherwise it will affect our long-term cost competitiveness and attractiveness for foreign investments.&nbsp; I would rather look at how we can help Singaporeans become more competitive rather than to stop the foreigners from coming.&nbsp; We have two choices.&nbsp; I think the approach to help Singaporeans is more effective.&nbsp; We have done so through Jobs Credit, we have done so through the SPUR programme and by helping Singaporeans become more attractive, more employable, this will enhance their employment opportunities.&nbsp; This not only will help us in the short term during the recession, it will also build resilience and capability for the economy in the long term within our local workforce.&nbsp; So, that has been the approach that we are looking at.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the&nbsp;specific question on S Pass numbers, I think the growth in S Pass numbers is slowing down in line with the economy.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my reply, if the economy continues to slow down, the overall number of foreign workers will come down.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask the Acting Minister how many new work permits have been&nbsp;issued in the past few months, given that there are so many stories of foreign workers already here on work permit not having work or not having enough work.&nbsp; Why are new work permits still being issued?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, in response to the question, the overall number of foreign workers including work</p> <p align=left>Column: 3332<p><p>permit holders will be released on a quarterly basis.&nbsp; The number will be available sometime in April for the first quarter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the number of foreign workers here who have no jobs, I think I have answered that parliamentary question (PQ) sometime ago.&nbsp; The number of foreign workers that have employment disputes in Singapore remain very small compared to the overall size of the foreign worker population in Singapore.&nbsp; It constitutes about 0.4%&nbsp;&ndash; I am recalling from memory&nbsp;&ndash; 0.4% of total foreign worker population in Singapore.&nbsp; Therefore, the conclusion is that overall, the vast majority of foreign workers who are working in Singapore are productively engaged.&nbsp; They do have work and they are paid according to their contracts with their employers.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a small number of workers who have employment disputes&nbsp;&ndash; the Ministry will do what we can to help them resolve their disputes.&nbsp; We do expect that this number to grow over time given the economic slowdown, just like Singaporean workers who may face retrenchment problems and we have just answered the earlier question on the foreign workers who may have to be released or made redundant.&nbsp; So, increasingly we do see an increasing number of foreign workers who may not have jobs going forward.&nbsp; Some of the contracts may have been terminated or may have been delayed, or some of the new contracts, new projects may not have commenced.&nbsp; So, I think we have to expect that to happen.&nbsp; What is important for us is to ensure that the workers who encountered such problems should approach the Ministry and we will help them wherever we can.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The employers should continue to act responsibly.&nbsp; If they are no longer able to support the foreign workers because they have lost their contracts or the contracts have been terminated, I think these employers will then have to repatriate </p> <p align=left>Column: 3333<p><p>these workers after settling all the salary issues and employment issues.&nbsp; So going forward, we will continue to see volatility in the labour market, some sectors will be doing better than the others and we will monitor the situation carefully and, if necessary, we will come out with additional measures to help Singaporean workers.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is important for us to look at the manpower policy with an overview so that the various quotas are imposed on various sectors.&nbsp; If we start to micro-manage each different business, each different service, each different industry or company, I think we will run into many difficulties and problems, and there will also be a lot of abuse and leakages in between the different businesses because companies are not well defined.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think it is important for us to maintain overall sectorial control in the regulation of foreign manpower quota system.&nbsp; At the same time, we also have to step up enforcement efforts which the Ministry is doing to ensure compliance to our regulatory system and to make sure that our overall framework of foreign manpower management will not be</p>   <p align=left>Column: 3334<p> <p>undermined by unscrupulous employers.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):&nbsp;</B> By design, community hospitals (CHs) cost less to run than acute hospitals.&nbsp; They are less capital, manpower and skills intensive.&nbsp; This does not compromise care because the patients admitted there do not require the intensive treatment offered by acute hospitals.&nbsp; The cost of running the community hospital is about one third the cost of running an acute hospital.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Health subsidises many patients for their community hospital care.&nbsp; Our subsidy extends up to middle income Singaporeans, say, with a monthly income of $5,200 per month for a family of four.&nbsp; Patients can use Medisave to help pay their bills and MediShield also covers the hospitalisation in community hospital for those who subscribe to it.&nbsp; For patients who still have financial difficulty paying the bills, Medifund provides the safety net.&nbsp; In addition, the community hospitals run by charities raise funds, as part of their social mission, to help provide financial assistance to patients in need.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, my Ministry increased the subvention to community hospitals to help them and their patients cope with the</p> <p align=left>Column: 3336<p><p>economic slowdown and we will do more as we discussed in last month's Budget debate.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have explained before why means-testing in community hospitals and acute hospitals&nbsp;is not identical although both share the same objective of wanting to help the low income group.&nbsp; I have feedback that some patients get missed out at the margin.&nbsp;

We set up the Agency for Integrated Care to strengthen discharge planning and facilitate transfers.&nbsp; The number of admissions to community hospitals has been increasing steadily.&nbsp; We are also getting acute hospitals to collaborate closely with community hospitals to make the transfers hassle free. Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Ren Ci community hospital formalised such a collaboration recently and we encourage other hospitals to do the same.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

it is a lot more stringent and because of the substantial increase in the hospital fees of community hospitals, a lot of middle income Singaporeans are affected.&nbsp; In the case of one hospital, the&nbsp;C class ward has gone up to $3,900 per month in terms of the ward charges.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Afterall, Ren Ci Hospital itself is run now by, I think,&nbsp;an MOH-appointed CEO and is located right next to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital.&nbsp; Are there not&nbsp;any benefits to, for example, reaping economies of scale?&nbsp;

In fact, when it started, it was under the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; As a young officer, I was involved in planning the first community hospital, the Ang Mo Kio</p> <p align=left>Column: 3338<p><p>Community Hospital.&nbsp; But, subsequently, the Ministry felt that it was worth trying out to see if charities could run community hospitals.&nbsp; That was how the change came about.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not think it is critical, one way or the other, that we must be the provider or we must not be the provider.&nbsp; But we know we will always be the financier for the lower income group because that is our job to make sure that the low income can afford essential services, whether in acute hospitals or in community hospitals.&nbsp; Whether the provider must necessarily be the Government, I think one can debate on such an issue.&nbsp; The key point is that they must be competent, are able to do the job and do bring additional value to the table.&nbsp; I believe they do.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SALE OF STRUCTURED PRODUCTS--><p align=left>Column: 3338<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SALE OF STRUCTURED PRODUCTS:::3341--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If MAS was not lax and financial institutions (FIs) did, in fact, breach the then prevailing regulations, and these proposed changes are merely to tighten them further, then what will MAS do to ensure that FIs do not, in any legal proceedings, make the unmeritorious argument that the fact that MAS is proposing new regulatory changes, means that MAS was lax and that what they had done was not prevented by then-existing regulations?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I think we want to be able to give Singaporean investors the choice that is available because there is a wide range of investors.&nbsp; It is not possible for us to be overly prescriptive,&nbsp;so we need to strike a balance.&nbsp; Overall, regulatory authorities all over the world have looked at what is happening and they have made changes to their regulations.&nbsp; MAS, being a responsible regulator, has also done so.&nbsp; It has collected views from all the stakeholders, put up the paper for consultation and we are now in the process of receiving&nbsp; feedback.&nbsp; This does not mean that MAS has been lax in its regulations.&nbsp; We do recognise that&nbsp;structured products have become more complex,&nbsp;the environment has changed, and, therefore, as a responsible regulator,&nbsp;MAS also has to make the adjustments.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CREDIT FACILITIES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:CREDIT FACILITIES:::3344--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mdm Phua and Miss Low asked about the measures in place to regulate the credit card and unsecured credit lending practices of financial institutions (FIs).&nbsp; The unsecured credit rules are now applied in a consistent manner to both moneylenders and&nbsp;FIs.&nbsp; This is not a loosening of the rules.&nbsp; For the moneylenders, in fact, the new rules reflect a tightening.&nbsp; Overall, the new rules which set the annual income threshold for access to unsecured credit at $20,000 and the credit limit for this group of borrowers at two months their income, allow these Singaporeans modest levels of unsecured credit which they may need from time to time.&nbsp; They may also reduce the risk of such individuals turning to unlicensed moneylenders.&nbsp; Consistent with this objective, MAS has not lowered the minimum annual income threshold for credit cards, which remains at $30,000, as these are typically used to finance consumption expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS has introduced several measures to mitigate the risks of over-borrowing by individuals from all income groups.&nbsp; These include more explicit requirements on disclosure to customers of charges, rates of computation, and consequences of late payment with regard to these cards and facilities.&nbsp; Banks and card issuers are also required to conduct comprehensive checks with the Credit Bureau before granting each new credit or charge card, or unsecured credit facility.&nbsp; The credit report sets out the number of credit lines the applicant already has and his repayment record.&nbsp; FIs are expected to</p> <p align=left>Column: 3343<p><p>take these into account in deciding whether to extend further credit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the new rules, FIs are not allowed to make offers of unsecured credit facilities to customers, unless the customer has requested for these in writing.&nbsp; This follows similar restrictions on unsolicited offers of credit cards that are already in place.&nbsp; This means that, with effect from 1st March 2009, financial institutions are prohibited from sending any articles&nbsp;&ndash; such as cheques&nbsp;&ndash; that an individual can use to draw down on an unsecured credit facility, unless he has requested for the facility in writing, or unless the unsecured credit facility has previously been granted to that individual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, the level of credit card debt level has also not deviated much from the historical average.&nbsp; The charge-off rate, which measures credit card debt written off by banks and card issuers, as a percentage of the rollover balance, has kept within the range of 3% to 4% over 2007 and 2008.&nbsp; There was a modest increase from 3.7% in Q3 of 2008 to 4% in Q4 2008.&nbsp; This compares with over above 8% during the SARS period.&nbsp; Credit card balances rolled over for a month or longer, which may indicate that some cardholders need longer than one month after due date to pay their credit card bills, averaged 15% in 2008.&nbsp; There was no noticeable increase in Q4 2008 from this full-year average.&nbsp; The 15% average for 2008 is comparable with the five-year average of 17% between 2004 and 2008, and below the 20% to 25% range recorded during the peak period between 1999 and 2003.&nbsp; Despite a slight increase in the ratio in January 2009, it is still too early to draw firm conclusions.&nbsp; MAS will continue to monitor these indicators.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, lenders and borrowers both have a role to play in ensuring the use of unsecured credit and credit cards is responsible, sustainable and within the means of the borrower.&nbsp;

This is really a question about the link between oil prices and public transport fares.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Public Transport Council (PTC) decides on fare adjustments each year, the adjustment is based on a formula that is pegged to changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wage Index (WI) over the preceding year, and not oil prices.&nbsp; Oil prices, therefore, impact public transport fares only indirectly through their impact on the CPI.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that fares will not fluctuate to the same degree as oil prices, as oil impacts the various components of the CPI to different degrees.&nbsp; Furthermore, an increase in one component in the CPI may be offset by falls in others.&nbsp; Thus fares will not drop as much when there is a dramatic drop in oil prices.&nbsp; But equally, when oil prices shoot up, fares will also not shoot up as much either.&nbsp;&nbsp;We explicitly decided not to allow direct pass through of fuel and wage costs to commuters by the operators. This is to give operators every incentive to operate efficiently, and keep costs as low as possible.&nbsp; This was why last year, despite a 40% increase in diesel prices, the increase in CPI and WI was only 2.1% and 6.9% respectively, leading to an allowable fare adjustment of just 3%. As the PTC also made the operators absorb a large part of the increase in transfer rebate then, fares went up by only 0.7% in October last year.&nbsp; So, the fare formula not only incentivises the operators to be efficient, it also moderates the effects that drastic spikes in oil prices have on public transport fares. In this way, commuters are protected while the public transport system is kept sustainable.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

In fact, the maximum allowable fare adjustment each year is transparent, as it is determined by a formula based on publicly-available </p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t <p align=left>Column: 3347<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>indicators such as CPI and wages.&nbsp; Conditions for deviations from the formula are also specified in the 2005 Report of the Committee on the Fare Review Mechanism.&nbsp; If and when a deviation is warranted, the PTC will clearly explain its decision, as it did in 2007 when it rejected the operators' applications to increase train fares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the recent announcement by the PTC and operators to reduce fares was outside the fare review framework. &nbsp;This was because the operators had decided not to apply for a fare increase under the fare review formula this year.&nbsp; Being mindful of the current economic conditions, they instead took the initiative to work with the PTC to pass on more than the savings they will receive from the Budget measures to commuters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with the PTC, they decided on an overall 4.6% reduction in bus and train fares.&nbsp; This is a significant reduction as it more than offsets the fare increases of the past three years combined (0.7% in 2008, 1.1% in 2007 and 1.7% in 2006).&nbsp; Commuters on the whole will pay total fares that are less than what they paid in 2006.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some commentators have presented the fare reduction package as only a 2 cents reduction.&nbsp; This is misleading.&nbsp; We need to look at the whole fare adjustment.&nbsp; This year, the fare adjustment formula allows for a fare increase of up to 5%, or 6 to 7 cents.&nbsp; On top of foregoing this 6 to 7 cents fare increase, the operators decided on a further 2 cents reduction across the board, and the PTC concurrently increased the transfer rebate by 10 cents.&nbsp; So the fare reduction package is not only \"2 cents\", but in fact \"2 to 14 cents\" per journey.&nbsp; For journeys that involve more then&nbsp;one transfer, the reduction is even more, 26 or 38 cents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In working out the fare reduction package, the PTC had sought to benefit</p> <p align=left>Column: 3348<p><p>as many commuters as possible, particularly those who make transfers.&nbsp; Currently,&nbsp;six in 10 commuters, a majority, make at least one transfer a week.&nbsp; These commuters will enjoy significant savings because of the increase in transfer rebate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, all commuters will benefit in the longer term from these changes.&nbsp; The increase in transfer rebate brings us closer to distance-based through-fares, where a direct journey will have the same fare as a transfer journey of comparable distance.&nbsp; By reducing and ultimately eliminating the transfer penalty, all commuters would be given more choice over the routes for their journeys.&nbsp; They would not be penalised for choosing to make transfers if doing so were faster, more direct or provided a better travel experience.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker,&nbsp;a Private Education (PE) Bill will be moved in the second half of this year to provide powers to better regulate the private education sector and the set up of the Council for Private Education (CPE).&nbsp; Once this PE Bill is passed, the CPE comprising members from the fields of education, quality assurance and business will implement the enhanced registration regime and the voluntary quality assurance scheme, called EduTrust.&nbsp; The CPE expects the first Private Education Institutions (PEIs) to be registered under the enhanced framework by the end of&nbsp;this year after the Bill is passed, and with all eligible&nbsp;institutions to be registered within an 18-month timeframe from then.&nbsp; The first PEIs to undergo EduTrust certification can be expected around the first quarter of 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides regulation, the CPE will also take on roles of developing the private education industry, including fostering greater industry stewardship and consumer education.&nbsp; This will be a holistic approach to uplift the overall quality of private education players.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Mehta asked about inter-Ministry approach and, indeed, that is the approach that we are taking because we recognise that this private education sector requires a whole-of-government response.&nbsp; So the CPE will be working closely with various stakeholder agencies such as Economic Development Board (EDB), SPRING Singapore and Singapore Tourism Board (STB), and other inter-agency collaborations.&nbsp; The basic aim is to improve the quality of our private education institutions as well as to&nbsp;promote consumer education.&nbsp; We have senior representatives from EDB, SPRING Singapore and STB appointed to this Council and this will&nbsp;further facilitate collaborations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 3351<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the registration process in transiting to the new regulatory regime, PEIs would be required to submit and disclose key information concerning their courses, teaching staff, student enrolment, facilities and other business operations.&nbsp; The data submitted by them will also serve as a useful update on the local private education sector which the Council will&nbsp;use in its planning, review and oversight activities,&nbsp;with&nbsp;respective stakeholders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof.&nbsp;Mehta&nbsp;also asked and expressed concern about bogus teachers in these institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new regime will tackle this issue in three ways.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, we will stipulate the requirements for a teacher to possess educational qualifications generally of at least one level above the programme he or she will be teaching.&nbsp; So if you are teaching a diploma, you ought to have&nbsp;a degree.&nbsp; In addition, PEIs must ensure that the teachers' degree qualifications are authentic and recognised by education authorities in their home countries.&nbsp; Officers of the CPE will follow up with compliance checks when they perform on-site inspections as part of their regular enforcement regime.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, should investigations uncover instances of teachers who do not meet the stipulated requirements, the Council would be able to direct the institutions&nbsp;to cease the deployment of teachers who do not meet the stipulated qualifications.&nbsp; And if it is found that false information has been furnished or material fact has been deliberately withheld, the&nbsp;institutions will also be guilty of an offence under the new regime.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, PEIs who apply for EduTrust certification would also be assessed on how their academic staff are recruited, deployed and monitored to ensure teaching quality.&nbsp; Students who want to be more certain of the quality of the</p> <p align=left>Column: 3352<p><p>teaching and overall standards of the PEI can rely on EduTrust as a mark of assurance.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob asked what interim measures we could take to protect students in the lead up to this new legislation.&nbsp; In the interim&nbsp;prior to the introduction of this new&nbsp;legislation, the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) (which administers the \"CaseTrust for Education\" certification) is stepping up checks to ensure that certified PEIs remain compliant with CaseTrust's requirements in student fee protection and welfare, to ensure that the interests of students remain safeguarded during this economically difficult period.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new regulatory regime represents a substantive change and adjustment for the private education sector.&nbsp; The Council is currently engaging various stakeholders on the proposed regime through a public consultation exercise, which is open till 6th May.&nbsp; I strongly urge various stakeholders to weigh in, and&nbsp;if there are good ideas&nbsp;or views on how the private education sector here can be improved, these ideas will be incorporated.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But let me say on an overall scale, we can improve things and this is the reason why we want to</p><p align=left>Column: 3353<p><p>introduce a new legislation.&nbsp; I think we all recognise that we have allowed the private educational sector to grow over the last few years and there is a balance between very tight regulation and growth.&nbsp;

Let me answer the second question&nbsp;first as to why it was not included.&nbsp; It was included under the general Act but I would say that that enforcement was very light-touch.&nbsp; As I said in reply to Mdm Halimah Yacob's question, there is a balance in reality between regulation and growth.&nbsp;

But let me also give some perspective.&nbsp; Even with the new regulation, there will still be that balance between regulation and growth.&nbsp; If you really wanted to have a very tight regulatory regime, you would say, well, let us close down 75% of schools in Singapore.&nbsp; Number one, I do not think that is well served.&nbsp; Number two, it is a dynamic process.&nbsp; So when you want to be a globalised city and you allow providers from many countries to come in, we ought to be honest and say that we may not be able to keep tabs with all the developments in the home countries from which these providers sometimes come from or are affiliated with.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

and (b) whether there is any form of accountability for fund managers who invested \"too early\" in failing banks.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Ms Sylvia Lim's question has to do with the 25% fall in GIC's overall portfolio value since the peak that Chairman of GIC recently referred to.&nbsp; 25% is approximately the fall in value of GIC's portfolio (in US$ terms) from the time global markets peaked in October 2007 until December 2008.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fall in value has reflected major declines in the global markets.&nbsp; Global equity markets have fallen by about 45%, using the MSCI World Index or any other leading global indices.&nbsp; Global real estate markets have fallen by 55%, again, based on the commonly used indices.&nbsp; One of the few asset classes with positive returns over the period has been bonds&nbsp;&ndash; global bonds have gained in value by about 6%, using the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost all institutional investors have therefore seen large falls in their portfolio values over the period.&nbsp; Norway's NBIM (Norges Bank Investment Management), which is Norway's equivalent of GIC, has lost around 27% (in US$ terms) from October 2007 to December 2008.&nbsp; The US university endowments reported average losses of 26% from July 2007 to December 2008.&nbsp; The periods do not exactly match, but this is the available data and you can see the trends are very similar.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim had also asked about GIC's performance over the different asset classes during this period.&nbsp; GIC has, on the whole, performed on par with market portfolios based on a similar mix of asset classes since the peak in October 2007.&nbsp; But if Ms Sylvia Lim's question</p>  <p align=left>Column: 3357<p>  <p>has to do with how GIC's portfolio has been affected by its equity investments, including its high profile investments, the answer is that GIC's overall equity portfolio has moved broadly in line with the relevant global equity market indices during the period&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;in fact, it suffered a slightly smaller decline than the market indices.&nbsp; Fundamentally, however, it is not appropriate to assess the performance of endowment funds like the GIC or Norway's NBIM over the short-term, or on the basis of individual asset classes or investments.&nbsp; We have to take the portfolio as a whole, and assess its performance over the long term.&nbsp; In other words, not over a year or two, nor from the peak to the trough of a single cycle, but across the market cycles.&nbsp; That is the mandate which the Government has given GIC&nbsp;&ndash; to secure good long-term returns on the overall portfolio.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with this mandate, GIC's strategy is to allocate funds across a broad range of asset classes, including higher risk assets such as equities and real estate, with the aim of achieving good long-term returns.&nbsp; It invests in a diversified portfolio that takes into account the risk and return characteristics of each asset class, so as to achieve better returns for the combined portfolio over the long term. This strategy accepts that individual asset classes and investments may not always do well, but that taken together, and over a longer period, they must contribute to the good overall performance of the portfolio.&nbsp; In other words, GIC consciously accepts the risk that individual investments and asset classes may underperform, especially over the short term, because only by accepting these risks and diversifying its portfolio can GIC achieve better longer-term performance returns.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, during severe market cycles, we must expect to see significant</p>   <p align=left>Column: 3358<p>   <p>fluctuations in GIC's portfolio value like we have seen today.&nbsp; This also happened in 2001, when the equity markets collapsed.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, GIC's returns over the long term have been creditable by international standards.&nbsp; I fully understand why people are concerned about losses in the value of GIC's portfolio during this current crisis.&nbsp; But the recent 25% decline in GIC's portfolio value has to be viewed against the much larger investment returns that it has gained over the last 10 years&nbsp;&ndash; besides the more significant gains over a longer period.&nbsp; In other words, despite seeing two major declines in portfolio value, in 2001 and in the current crisis, GIC's portfolio has grown significantly in value over the last 10 years. The 25% decline comes out of a much larger cumulative investment return gained in the preceding years&nbsp;&ndash; the preceding five, 10 years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIC takes very seriously every decline in the value of its portfolio, including declines in the value of its individual investments, in its tactical reviews.&nbsp; But it will have to keep to its fundamental strategy of diversifying across asset classes, accepting the risks of investing in riskier assets like equities and real estate, and investing for the longer term, investing for long-term gain in other words.&nbsp; That is how it can make the most of its strategic advantage as a long-term endowment fund and continue to deliver good returns over the longer term horizon.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim also asked about accountability for GIC's fund managers based on their performance.&nbsp; Each GIC investment manager and the fund management team, as a whole, are accountable for their performance.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIC evaluates its investment managers regularly on the basis of several factors&nbsp;&ndash; the performance of GIC's overall investment portfolio, how the team </p>  <p align=left>Column: 3359<p>  <p>managing each asset class performs against specific market benchmarks or absolute return targets as well as how the individual investment professional has himself or herself contributed to the team's performance.&nbsp; Consistent with GIC's orientation as a long-term investor, the fund managers are evaluated not just on the performance of their portfolio within a single year, but on a continuing basis and measured against appropriate benchmarks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the compensation framework supports a culture of responsibility and ensures that GIC is able to attract and retain the necessary talent to support its long-term performance.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:TRAINING FOR NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:TRAINING FOR NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANISATIONS:::3361--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We also have new training initiatives, including an NPO Executive Director Mentoring Programme, and an experiential Social Leadership Singapore programme aimed at developing key leadership in this&nbsp;sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, there are also initiatives such as the Sabbatical Leave Scheme and the Professional Leadership and Development Scheme as well as the NCSS Scholar Management Programme&nbsp;which will&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;scholars' transition into the social service sector. This programme provides mentoring for personal and professional growth. NCSS is also exploring providing a coaching programme for new entrants to help them settle into this&nbsp;sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCYS and NCSS have been working with the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) in order to provide&nbsp;enhanced funding support for social service training under the&nbsp;Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR). SPUR basically leverages on the extensive Continuing Education and Training (CET) system and includes Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) courses for the Community and Social Service sector. Currently, we have&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3361<p><p>21 courses available within&nbsp;this&nbsp;sector which will enjoy support from SPUR, and that means people who go through these courses will enjoy&nbsp;a subsidy of 90% of the course fees.&nbsp; In addition, if the applicants are employed by the non-profit sector or the voluntary welfare organisations, SPUR also pays a training allowance of up to $1,000 a month.&nbsp; In other words, they can come onto the employee list of the non-profit sector, be sent for training, enjoy 90% subsidy and receive a training allowance.&nbsp; This is indeed a generous package which we hope will enable us to attract more people to go into the social service sector, especially at a time like this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as social workers are concerned, there is&nbsp;a shortfall of 100 a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;also want to highlight that we will need about 2,500 new workers in the social service sector over the next five years.&nbsp; Similarly, in the childcare sector, you will know that we are expanding&nbsp;the number of childcare centres.&nbsp; We need 2,000 new people to come into this sector over the next five years.&nbsp; So, the bottomline is that jobs are available, training capacity is available, subsidies are available for training, and training allowances are available.&nbsp; So&nbsp;especially for people, like the PMETs who are unemployed or retrenched, this is a great opportunity to consider a career in the social service sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.00 pm</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

He emphasised the undesirability of the film medium as a platform to conduct political discourse.&nbsp; This was because party political films can be employed to sensationalise or present serious issues in a biased and emotional manner.&nbsp; We should keep politics objective and rational rather than allow emotions to be whipped up in place of rational responses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Rationale remains valid</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The purpose of the restriction was to ensure that people debated politics seriously and not allow it to be reduced to a contest where political parties and candidates promote themselves through camera angles, sharp and slick editing techniques or emotive, slanted presentations. This purpose remains valid. However, the world has changed over the</p><p align=left>Column: 3364<p><p>past decade.&nbsp; The web is ubiquitous and is a major source of multi-media information.&nbsp; Societal norms have evolved.&nbsp; We have to adjust to this new environment while recognising that we still want politics to be treated as a serious matter.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should not prevent people from recording video clips of political events held in accordance with the law or from making factual documentary videos of political issues and events.&nbsp; But we must continue to have limits against undesirable political materials, for example, fictionalised accounts or political commercials, even though it may not be possible to enforce these limits completely.&nbsp; Hence, we have tabled amendments to the Films Act.&nbsp; How the parameters in this Bill will be interpreted and where the limits will be drawn can be subjective and a matter of judgment.&nbsp; Therefore, we propose to establish an independent advisory committee, the Political Films Consultative Committee (PFCC), to advise the Board of Film Censors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes we are making are significant ones and will bring our rules up to date.&nbsp; We also recognise that the situation is dynamic and the environment will continue to evolve.&nbsp; We are prepared to make further changes when it is appropriate to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Technological and societal changes</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the decade that has passed since the Bill was first moved, technology has advanced rapidly. Singaporeans are very much plugged in to new media.&nbsp; Household broadband penetration rate is close to 100% and mobile penetration rate is 131%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet and the emergence of Web 2.0 technology have drastically transformed the way in which information is produced, disseminated, shared and consumed.&nbsp; New media technology has </p><p align=left>Column: 3365<p><p>enabled communities to be formed around shared interests and for people to access information, participate in and be connected across a wide variety of issues, ranging from national and political matters to specific interests and hobbies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adept at using Web 2.0 communication tools, many Singaporeans, especially the young, have blogs and Facebook accounts.&nbsp; With the ubiquity of recording devices and widely and freely available editing software, you can shoot a film on your handphone or digital camera, edit it on your computer, and publish your work instantly on the web&nbsp;&ndash; on your blog, on your Facebook and share them with friends or on YouTube where the rest of the world can view them.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The texture of our society has also evolved.&nbsp; With better education and greater exposure to the world through travel, globalisation and the Internet, our generation of young Singaporeans today are different.&nbsp; They want more of the following&nbsp;&ndash; space for political discourse, greater engagement with the Government, and their views to be taken seriously by the Government.&nbsp; So it is therefore important that the Government learns to make better use of the medium of film and new media tools to reach out and engage, inform, educate and obtain the views of media-savvy Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Global trend&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> In other countries, we have seen how new media and social networking tools have been used in political discourse.&nbsp; In the 2007 Australian elections, which were dubbed the \"Facebook Elections\"&nbsp;&ndash; Facebook was used extensively by Kevin Rudd, now the Prime Minister, to reach out to young voters.&nbsp; The US presidential elections last year was dubbed the \"YouTube Elections\".&nbsp; Presidential candidate, Barrack Obama, had used YouTube</p><p align=left>Column: 3366<p><p>extensively and a spectrum of new media platforms from Flickr to Twitter, to connect with different groups of voters.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closer to home, the last Malaysian elections also saw extensive use of new media tools and videos by interested parties.&nbsp; While some videos were factually true, many were deliberately misleading and calculated to arouse and stir emotions by portraying only a certain viewpoint and selecting only certain extreme shots.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, this is one of the downsides to politics conducted over the Internet&nbsp;&ndash; videos and advertisements edited deliberately to distort what was said, to cast doubt and to push a certain agenda.&nbsp; Knowing that it was impossible to correct every untruth on every site, candidate Obama set up one website called \"Fight the Smears\" in an attempt to set the record straight on rumours, gossips, half-truths and lies which were pervasive over the Internet.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, while videos, films and new media can be widely used and can improve communications, we must be mindful that they can be easily abused.&nbsp; This is the reason why, even as we liberalise, there needs to be some safeguards to minimise the risk that they will be exploited and to reduce the undesirable effects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Why only certain party political films are allowed under amended Films Act&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, the Government recognises that Singaporeans, in particular our young, want greater space for political discourse.&nbsp; Over the years, the Government has liberalised and widened the space for expression and participation, and has encouraged citizens to engage in objective dialogue and participate in building a better Singapore for everyone.&nbsp; When Web 1.0 came on the scene, Government Ministries and agencies created websites and online feedback channels as well as</p><p align=left>Column: 3367<p><p>chat rooms and bulletin boards to communicate with Singaporeans.&nbsp; A light-touch approach was also adopted towards regulating the Internet.&nbsp; With Web 2.0, the Ministries and agencies are also learning to use new media platforms to interact with citizens.&nbsp; Moving forward, the Government will adopt an even lighter touch with the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the amendments that I seek to make to the Films Act today is another significant step taken by the Government to further liberalise and expand the space for greater political discourse.&nbsp; With the amended Films Act, we will allow certain types of films which could otherwise be party political films&nbsp;&ndash; that is, films that are factual and objective, and do not dramatise and/or present a distorted picture.&nbsp; Now these films will now be allowed with the proposed amendments.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the start of my speech, I had recapped that the intent of disallowing party political films is to keep a proper balance between the emotive and the rational for political debates in Singapore. This is a necessary safeguard given the experiences of recent elections in other countries.&nbsp; This is because anyone can easily shoot and produce a film, and circulate it widely.&nbsp; With sophisticated editing and computer technology today, one can do almost anything to sensationalise or distort the facts and pass this off as the truth.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As hon. Members would be aware, pictures could be superimposed on one another, doctored or manufactured to make a scene or situation look real when it is not, such as to portray a well-known political figure of a particular religion indulging in the practices of another religion.&nbsp; It can be considered character assassination but more significantly, it is a dangerous act with gross ill intent to stoke religious sensitivities.</p><p align=left>Column: 3368<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is how factual film footages could be edited slickly to remove the proper context of the original footages.&nbsp; Whatever examples we use, whether it is a crude distortion or one that is so subtle and slick that the untruth appears as the truth, the intention is to mislead and confuse the viewers in pursuit of a certain agenda.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, allow me to address the often quoted argument that since the Internet has made it almost impossible to enforce the law, the ban on party political films is meaningless and the Films Act is rendered archaic.&nbsp; Critics argue that such films, including banned films, are available on the Internet and people can watch them and so we should do away with the law altogether.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are good reasons to make a distinction between what happens in the virtual world and the real world. &nbsp;First, while we recognise that there are practical limitations to prevent all undesirable films from circulation on the Internet, it is sensible and practical not to allow copies of such films from circulating widely and taking root outside of cyberspace. &nbsp;It is still a large and significant audience in the real world.&nbsp; Second, there is a distinct difference in the effect and impact of watching a film alone, for example, through a computer terminal off the Internet and having a group of people watch it together.&nbsp; Unlike an excited individual, an excited group of people can easily fuel and exacerbate the emotions.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, regulatory legislation is not just about enforcement.&nbsp; It is also about making a statement&nbsp;on what our society recognises as the acceptable norms and the fundamental standards for what is considered the proper conduct of political debate and electioneering in our country.&nbsp; Our original concerns about films that sensationalise and distort are therefore still valid today but neither should we impose a total ban on all party</p><p align=left>Column: 3369<p><p>political films. &nbsp;In line with the recommendation of the Advisory Council on the Impact of New Media on Society&nbsp;(AIMS), a gradual, calibrated approach in relaxing the regulations on party political films have been taken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Films Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The Films Act will be amended to allow for certain types of films which could today be party political films.&nbsp; Currently, all party political films are banned except for reporting of current affairs and films to inform or educate persons on the procedures and polling times for any election or national referendum in Singapore.&nbsp; So there are some amendments that we are making.&nbsp; First, we are amending section 2(3)(a) to spell out more clearly that exemption applies to films made solely for the purpose of reporting of news by a licensed broadcasting service.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will also expand section 2(3) to allow films that are factual and objective, and do not dramatise and/or present a distorted picture.&nbsp; With the amendments, the following will no longer be considered as party political films:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Live recordings of events held in accordance with the law;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;Anniversary and commemorative videos of political parties;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp;Factual documentaries, biographies or autobiographies;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;Manifestoes of political parties produced by or on behalf of a political party; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp;Candidate's declaration of policies or ideology produced by or on behalf of the candidate.</p><p align=left>Column: 3370<p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films with animation and dramatisation and distort what is real or factual will be disallowed, as the intent of the amendments is to ensure that these films do not undermine the seriousness of political debate.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, these amendments will allow much leeway for political parties and election candidates as well as individuals to produce party political films.&nbsp; At the same time, this will allow for political debate in Singapore to remain serious and robust.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Party political films allowed for Internet election advertising</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further liberalise the space for political expression, we have considered carefully and will correspondingly relax the Internet election advertising regulations.&nbsp; Political parties and their election candidates will be able to use films allowed under the amended Films Act&nbsp;during an election period.&nbsp; This goes beyond the recommendation of AIMS, which had, in fact, recommended that there be a blackout period for party political films during an election.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Independent advisory committee to assess party political films</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with the AIMS&rsquo; recommendation, the Government will set up an independent advisory committee to advise the Board of Film Censors (BFC) on whether any film is a party political film, and the film is allowed under the amended Films Act.&nbsp; This will be called the Political Films Consultative Committee (PFCC).</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had earlier announced the Chairman of the PFCC to be Mr Richard Magnus, retired Senior District Judge and Chairman of the Casino Regulatory Authority.&nbsp; Should Parliament pass this Bill, Mr Magnus will then proceed to form the Committee and draw members from relevant fields, for example, the academia, </p><p align=left>Column: 3371<p><p>legal fraternity, labour movement, the print media and the film sector.&nbsp; In consultation with the Chairman, the Minister for Information, Communication and the Arts will then appoint between six and eight members to form this advisory committee.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PFCC members will exercise judgment to assess if a film is a party political film or comes within the exclusions in the Bill, and give their assessment to the BFC.&nbsp; The BFC and PFCC have a challenging task at hand.&nbsp; As with assessing and rating films with some degree of sex, nudity, violence and coarse language, assessing whether a film is a party political film is not an exact science.&nbsp; There will be an element of subjectivity and there will be grey areas.&nbsp; What is factual, what is not?&nbsp; What contributes to an objective or non-objective film?&nbsp; Members of the BFC and PFCC will have to apply their minds and interpret within the parameters that we have established for them in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Process of determining a party political film</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, unless exempted under section 40 of the Films Act, all films are required under section 14 to be submitted to the BFC for classification.&nbsp; Films exempted from this include films that are made by individuals&nbsp;not intended for distribution or public exhibition, as long as these are not obscene or party political.&nbsp; Examples of these films that are exempted include&nbsp;wedding celebrations and&nbsp;birthday parties and corporate training videos.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The BFC will assess all films that are submitted to it for classification.&nbsp; Any film that the BFC considers could be&nbsp;party political&nbsp;will be sent to the PFCC for their evaluation and views.&nbsp; The BFC will study the PFCC&rsquo;s recommendation before making its decision as to the status of the film.</p><p align=left>Column: 3372<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any owner of a film that disagrees with the Board&rsquo;s decision can appeal to the Films Appeal Committee, or FAC, which is already provided for in the Films Act.&nbsp; The FAC is made up of private and public sector individuals and its decision on appeal is final.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments that we are proposing will significantly open up a much larger space for political discourse using the medium of film.&nbsp; We trust that individuals, political parties and filmmakers will find ample opportunities to bring their messages across in creative and constructive ways through films that do not distort or dramatise.&nbsp; In doing so, we will continue to keep our political discourse sober and rational.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, thank you for allowing me to kick off the debate on this much watched Films (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; I will speak about the intent, content and also the process relating to the amendment itself.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the widely reported AIMS Committee recommendation, the Government has accepted most of the recommendations, amongst which is a gradual liberalisation of the films, including political films. This Amendment, therefore, is seen as a step in that direction.&nbsp; Yet, the Internet is riled with different opinions, questioning the intent of the amendment.&nbsp; Common questions asked are: Is this really&nbsp;a step towards liberation?&nbsp; Or is this a step backwards to contain certain political parties?&nbsp; Even worse, is this to introduce a catch-all clause to contain even the film producer, videographer and free speech?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let us be upfront here.&nbsp; Every country&nbsp;has worries about the ill effects</p><p align=left>Column: 3373<p><p>of unfettered free speech.&nbsp; However, the responses vary dramatically between countries.&nbsp; Even amongst Western liberal democracies, it would be hard to find uniformity.&nbsp; US is often seen to be at one end of the spectrum with its First Amendment which has been used to thwart most kinds of restrictions on free speech, including, very recently, even the attempt to rate pornographic websites!&nbsp; It is preposterous but it happened.&nbsp; Some European countries, on the other hand,&nbsp;have enacted laws against hate speech with relative ease and speed.&nbsp; At the other end, there are countries that purport to protect its citizens from the ill effects of Internet by banning it almost entirely!&nbsp; Again, impossible but it happened.&nbsp; And there is of course all the positions in&nbsp;between.&nbsp; There is, in other words, no international norm.&nbsp; And it&nbsp;is suffice to say that each jurisdiction will have to find its own set of principles that will work for its citizens in a fair and transparent manner, because&nbsp;this is the only way&nbsp;which it&nbsp;can be sustainable in the long term.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke with residents, grassroots leaders and opinion leaders to get a sense of whether there is a common view around this issue in Singapore.&nbsp; And the result?&nbsp; The views are as mixed as a kaleidoscope, and the colours are just as vibrant!&nbsp; While netizens tend to weigh heavily on the side of full liberalisation on political films, and allowing people to judge for themselves, others quoted the <I>bak-chor</I> mee stall story where a rumour can be misconstrued as reality, especially if it is allowed its full song and dance in pictures.&nbsp; Some also felt that politics should be kept clean, and not go down the way of the US or Korea and&nbsp;Taiwan&nbsp;where film stars, celebrities and clever producers were able to juice up serious political contests into a contest of bloopers and laughs, fancy dress competition or, worse, to escalate it into a</p><p align=left>Column: 3374<p><p>competition of who can get the best talent or pay the best producers for&nbsp;the most fanciful or persuasive film for infotainment.&nbsp; Closer to home, as Senior Minister of State has alluded to, in one of our&nbsp;neighbouring countries, illegally filmed footage of the private affairs of political leaders have also made their rounds, with disastrous consequences not just on the candidates, but also their family and community.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I guess one key consideration in this Bill is&nbsp;how and what do we want our political scene to look like in the long term.&nbsp; Would it be a&nbsp;serious contest where all views and citizens should be able to participate fully, fairly and in a cost effective manner, or one which becomes a costly circus of the fanciful?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, please allow me to clarify that I do not mean to say that full liberalisation or the current proposed form will result in one or the other.&nbsp; Rather, I take the view that versus doing nothing and absolutely nothing from our current position, and hence disallowing all political films, this amendment&nbsp;is a step towards liberalisation and, at the same time, safeguarding against money and showbiz politics&nbsp;&ndash; which can be a waste of resources and&nbsp;self-indulgent.&nbsp; But I do have some issues with some of the content of the amendment itself which includes certain problematic areas and words like, I quote, \"wholly accurate account\" where the word \"wholly accurate\" is debatable; \"no animation\" because I do not know of any persuasive films&nbsp;or documentaries today that could be completely animation-free; or \"the recording of actual and legal event only\".&nbsp; Please let me elaborate.&nbsp; It is questionable if good documentaries could and should be produced \"without any animation and composed wholly of an accurate account depicting&nbsp;actual events, persons and situations\" and without presenting them in any \"dramatic way\".&nbsp; Any serious documentary producer&rsquo;s major concern would be its dramatic </p><p align=left>Column: 3375<p><p>effect in telling the story so as to capture the audience.&nbsp; This is one of the ways in which the best documentaries in the world win awards.&nbsp; Even Al Gore&rsquo;s documentary, \"<I>An Inconvenient Truth</I>\", uses animation.&nbsp; Secondly, what is meant by \"wholly&nbsp;accurate account\"?&nbsp; If it&nbsp;was intended as an injunction against mixing&nbsp;fiction with facts, in other words, distortion of facts, then&nbsp;are there currently&nbsp;known remedies that could better address this situation?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the proposed Bill should spell out exactly what it means instead of using vague language and broad constructs.&nbsp; To argue that film censorship is more an art than a science, and the Government will use a \"light touch\", it is little comfort to serious producers on any side of the fence.&nbsp; So, Sir, while I do support not over-dramatising or distorting films into a fanciful circus of acts, I am also saying that having vague terms and constructs will not do serious documentaries with a bit of animation to illustrate certain points any good.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, does the amendment also make the filming of illegal activities,&nbsp;illegal?&nbsp; If so, this is even more problematic when licensed broadcasters, including foreign ones, are allowed to film them but ordinary citizens are not.&nbsp;&nbsp; If foreigners are allowed to film and disseminate, while citizens are not, then what is the Government actually trying to prevent?&nbsp; If the argument is that licensed broadcasters are easier to manage under the law whereas individuals/mavericks/rogue filmmakers are not, then reality is not as clear-cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as they are residents in Singapore and are known entities, I think there are some existing laws that&nbsp;can take its course.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, they are&nbsp;unknown and un-catchable, then&nbsp;it may also&nbsp;have the unintended&nbsp;effect of&nbsp;promoting anonymity and further lack of accountability.&nbsp; And by this, I mean that people who want to, will still upload their videos, but they will&nbsp;do it anonymously, via foreign&nbsp;media and, of course,</p><p align=left>Column: 3376<p><p>&nbsp;websites, and perhaps would dramatise it&nbsp;even&nbsp;further just to make their point.&nbsp; Would&nbsp;this, therefore, be worse off for Singapore as a whole?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think, at the very minimum, some of these questions need to be answered rationally as much as judgmentally.&nbsp; Hence, I urge the Minister to clearly articulate its intent, and clarify the content of the Bill as much as possible.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the process itself,&nbsp;for any government to be credible, it must be seen to be fair to all&nbsp;&ndash; regardless of language, religion, culture or political orientation.&nbsp; In this regard, the appointment of the Political Film Consultative Committee&nbsp;should be an open process, and the members of this Committee should be seen as neutral individuals who are reputed for their fairness in their dealings.&nbsp; I am heartened that Mr Richard Magnus would be chairing the Committee.&nbsp; He is known to be a very experienced and independent district judge.&nbsp; And I hope that the rest of the members would also take on that air of neutrality and fairness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the&nbsp;deliberations of the film itself, I think some have also asked&nbsp;should rejected films be given any reason so that they can work out what is acceptable and re-edit the film and re-submit for admission.&nbsp; And how will this process itself be different or would it be exactly the same as&nbsp;other films that are currently submitted to the censorship board for deliberation?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I think Singaporeans are highly educated and Singapore is one of the most connected nations in the world, especially the fact that we have very high penetration rates of broadband and the mobile.&nbsp; It is, therefore, important to encourage good political debate and public discourse, so that good views are not driven underground or only pushed to the cyberspace.&nbsp; And, of course, good political discourse and space would encourage iron</p><p align=left>Column: 3377<p><p>to sharpen iron.&nbsp; Open public discourse can also help to mature a society, help citizens to feel a sense of belonging and responsibility&nbsp;to Singapore.&nbsp; Hence, while the amendment is a step forward, it should be accompanied by steps to further encourage the political debate , so that society's critical faculty can become its best defence against any ill influences.&nbsp; And with that, we could further liberalise any political films/acts in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir,&nbsp;I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Thio Li-ann (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Thio Li-ann (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, films are a vehicle through which the right to free speech or expression is exercised and enjoyed.&nbsp; This right is entrenched in Article 14 of our Constitution, the supreme law of the land.&nbsp; This is not an unqualified right in any jurisdiction.&nbsp; The Films Act is one of a multitude of laws restricting the ambit of free expression in Singapore.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the terms of Article 14(2) of the Constitution, there are eight exhaustive grounds upon which Parliament may legislate to restrict free speech, if it considers this necessary or expedient, such as to provide for laws on defamation or judicial contempt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I must ask a preliminary question which perhaps should have been asked more than 25 years ago in 1981 when the Films Act was born.&nbsp; Which of the&nbsp;eight permissible grounds upon which free speech may constitutionally be restricted does the Films Act rest on?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask because this is not apparent on the face of the statute. &nbsp;Its preamble gives no indication of this. &nbsp;It merely states: the Act relates to \"the possession, importation, making, distribution and exhibition of films.\"&nbsp; Perhaps this specific constitutional ground for derogating from free speech rights was clarified in past </p><p align=left>Column: 3378<p><p>parliamentary debates which I may have missed, for which I beg the Minister&rsquo;s indulgence.&nbsp; But then, as a matter of law, it is always better for the avoidance of doubt to state things expressly rather than leave things to implication or inference.&nbsp; This is particularly important where constitutional rights or limits on constitutional rights are at stake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When constitutional rights are involved and the law seeks to curtail the rights of citizens, the onus is upon the Government to prove that the restrictions are necessary to serve one of the&nbsp;eight stipulated purposes in Article 14(2).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One might infer from practice, such as the pronouncements in various Censorship Review Committee Reports, that censorship serves goals like preventing harm to the public by protecting the impressionable young from the pernicious influence of salacious and unedifying film and TV content. &nbsp;Personally, I support this worthy goal.&nbsp; Constitutionally speaking, I would infer that this reason falls within a constitutional category which permits legal restrictions on speech&nbsp;&ndash; the category being that of \"public morality\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am more than a little perplexed with respect to the constitutional basis for the ban on \"party political films\".&nbsp; The current section 33 makes it an offence to make, distribute or exhibit the creature known as the \"party political film\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This current amendment removes the complete ban, which is a very restrictive form of prior restraint that pre-empts speech before it is even spoken, as opposed to imposing sanctions for speech after it is spoken.&nbsp; Which head under Article 14(2) does the regulation and restriction of party political films fall under?&nbsp; It must fall within one of these&nbsp;eight grounds to be a legitimate, constitutionally permissible restriction on speech and expression.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3379<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which ground is it?&nbsp; It cannot be public morality as party political films are a form of what might be called \"political speech\" which relates to political issues, however defined.&nbsp; The limits on political films cannot rest on public morality as political issues are not on the same level as pornography or obscenity, I hope.&nbsp; It is not a security issue, has nothing to do with friendly relations between states; I do not think party political films constitute an incitement to commit an offence.&nbsp; So, by process of elimination, I would hazard to guess that the regulation of party political films must somehow be related to the category of \"public order\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the 1998 parliamentary debates, it appears that the rationale for the prior blanket ban on party political films under section 33 was two-fold:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, it was considered a bad or undesirable medium for the message because film is one-sided in presenting a message and ill-suited to effective rebuttal which diminishes the quality of political debate.&nbsp; Further, the medium of film was thought to sensationalise issues, reducing debate to a contest between advertising agencies, which carries the vice of being simplistic without the virtue of simplicity.&nbsp; This was also thought to trivialise serious debate by provoking the emotions rather than eliciting rational reflection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I find it hard to see how a concern that party political films might sensationalise and trivialise political debate qualifies as a public order exception, unless we adopt a rather capacious or expansive understanding of \"public order\".&nbsp; As a legal category, there must be a core set of criteria for identifying a public order issue&nbsp;&ndash; it cannot be a \"fill in the blanks with whatever you like\" category. &nbsp;As an exception to rights, it can easily eat up the norm if so broadly defined.&nbsp; Sir, are the regulations on party political films based on such a broad</p><p align=left>Column: 3380<p><p> understanding of public order?&nbsp; I would appreciate it if the Minister could clarify if this is the case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it was thought that sufficient outlets for expressing political views, like publishing actual or virtual newsletters, already existed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this point, I would note that from past debates, Opposition politicians, like Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr Low Thia Khiang, forcefully pointed out that although the ban on party political films was neutral on the face of things, it was unequal in impact.&nbsp; All things considered holistically, equality of access to the Internet is not the sole factor to consider when the playing field is not level.&nbsp; For instance, Opposition parties have less access to mainstream media.&nbsp; This is a relevant factor when evaluating the importance of the Internet as a cheap, fast and effective method for getting out a political message to a broad spectrum of citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this sense, the Internet, with its great communicative power, acts as the great leveller, in mitigating disparate access to mainstream media, or even the variable financial and manpower resources available to the various political parties.&nbsp; It has been called the \"fifth estate\" for its role in holding&nbsp; government, and even the press, to account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet is a forum that politicians can no longer ignore; it has real world effects as a mobiliser and alternative information source.&nbsp; It shapes opinion and debate.&nbsp; Twenty-first century politicians must learn to negotiate this brave new terrain, its bright shiny cities of interactive dialogue and transparency and its dark lands of cyber-nuisance and online bullying.&nbsp; You cannot take online party political films out of the mix of alternative informational flows as this is a potent&nbsp;source of communication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3381<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, rational debate over public issues is important, but we also want to debate with passion and conviction, without abandoning the faculty of reason and becoming emotionally charged.&nbsp; Sir, we are not vulcans, worshipping solely at the altar of logic.&nbsp; Passion and intellect are not mutually exclusive. &nbsp;Politics speaks to the head and heart.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that film as a means of communication can be more visceral than cerebral in effect.&nbsp; Unlike the printed word, which requires more active participation and focus on the part of the consumer to determine meaning, we are more like passive recipients in watching film which feeds us with rich visual detail and is apt to sway populist emotions, engaging sensibility rather than sense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is particularly so where a rousing soundtrack is added, with soaring strings, to complement stirring imagery, a billowing flag&nbsp; against which the protagonist stands, looking noble. Alternatively, poor lighting and ugly angles can communicate wordlessly that an antagonist is shady, oily, snakey, not to be trusted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I share the concern that public debate may become sensationalised and thereby trivialised.&nbsp; I share the concern that public debate may be thwarted through propaganda and misinformation where there is a lopsided presentation of views without a chance to rebut and reply.&nbsp; This degrades democracy and the quality of debate which should be conserved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from free speech fundamentalists who prioritise speech to the neglect of other important competing values, most accept that free expression is not an ultimate value. &nbsp;Free speech has an intrinsic worth as a means of self-expression, but it draws its value from the argument that free speech and debate promotes truth and democracy.&nbsp; As the</p> <p align=left>Column: 3382<p><p>House of Lords said in a recent libel case, the freedom to communicate relates to the freedom to communicate information, not misinformation; misleading people does not serve the public interest and misinformation is in fact destructive of democratic society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, free expression is not an ultimate trump or value&nbsp;in Singapore, but it is an important value in serving truth in democratic debate.&nbsp; Which brings me to the question: why is the blanket ban on party political films being lifted?&nbsp; Is this being done because of a principled commitment to free speech or is it a pragmatic capitulation to the fact that technology has outstripped the state&rsquo;s ability to police the section 33 ban on party political films?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, section 33 is easily circumvented.&nbsp; Anyone with a cell-phone can make a movie and distribute it on the Internet. &nbsp;Record, upload, download, view.&nbsp; Banned political films are easily located on YouTube and have not attracted Government intervention.&nbsp; The blanket ban has too many holes in it torn by Internet technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology has outpaced regulatory capacity.&nbsp; However, in formulating laws, we need to distinguish between the desirability of enforcement and the capacity to enforce a legal norm.&nbsp; Laws which are hard to enforce may still fulfil an important social function and educative purpose. &nbsp;For example, the ban on obscene films or pornography signals to citizens what is normative, desirable and sociable.&nbsp; Just because Internet pornography is widely available does not mean we should hasten the deterioration of our moral ecology by lifting the ban and opening the door to mainstreaming pornography which degrades women through perpetuating sexual stereotypes.&nbsp; I urge the Government to retain the symbolic blocking of 100 Internet porn sites as a statement and reaffirmation of our values. &nbsp;Laws </p><p align=left>Column: 3383<p><p>lacking a sound moral basis will breed disaffection among citizens and hemorrhage legitimacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we are not today dealing with the relatively easy case of pornography, a form of speech&nbsp;lacking value, like slander or invective; such expressions are unworthy of constitutional protection.&nbsp; Instead, we are dealing with valuable speech, with political speech, the lifeblood of a democracy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Political speech about political issues educates and enlightens us.&nbsp; It facilitates robust and informed debate which heavy-handed censorship can emasculate, to our common detriment. &nbsp;The ideal in a representative democracy is an engaged body of citizens who express competing views and then weigh competing viewpoints.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we amending the Films Act out of an internalised commitment to strengthening the principle and practice of expressive freedoms in a democratic society, or are we merely capitulating to the external pressures of social realities and technological capacities?&nbsp; Since we cannot ban it, we may as well regulate it!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In loosening control over political films, it would be sad if we missed this opportunity to reflect upon the important role free expression plays in a democratic society.&nbsp; In a real sense, speech is never free as it always takes place within a context of competing values, social mores and local realities.&nbsp; We apply a cost-benefits analysis to it, in deciding how to value speech and give it due weight where balanced against other important competing rights and interests, such as racial harmony.&nbsp; We must ask: what is good and bad speech, what is the social value of speech,&nbsp;rather than assume the relevant starting point is to begin with a principle of unregulated speech, which itself begs justification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3384<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this shift from a blanket ban on party political films to a regulated one is to be quietly applauded.&nbsp; It is a small step rather than great leap in the right direction towards the liberalisation of forms of political speech as expressed through party political film on the Internet and beyond.&nbsp; It is progressive precisely because free expression serves the worthy goal of promoting democracy and political participation in at least two respects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, permitting certain forms of political films is a step towards enhancing genuine viewpoint diversity by allowing different voices and perspectives to be heard through a relatively accessible platform for communication.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, by opening the door to yet another source of informational flows distinct from the mainstream media, which works under certain constraints and predilections.&nbsp; To effectively participate in political discourse, citizens must be knowledgeable about public affairs.&nbsp; If relevant information is withheld, the danger is that the electorate can be manipulated or misled.&nbsp; And this is not conducive to a free society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By protecting political speech, a government is prevented from illegitimately silencing its own critics.&nbsp; Further, the free speech principle is a permanent challenge to the idea that some questions are beyond contention and thus a permanent challenge to authority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem today&nbsp;is not a dearth of information, frequently, but a deluge of information.&nbsp; This is a wake-up call to citizens to rise to the task of being responsible citizens, able to discriminate between substance and seductive but vacuous sound-bytes.&nbsp; It is unsound to base policy on sound-bytes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must have the maturity to ferret out mendacity, the discernment to divide</p><p align=left>Column: 3385<p><p>truth from dishonesty and deception.&nbsp; A discerning citizenry is a maturing citizenry; maturity is also marked by traits of civility, self restraint, a sense of proportion and propriety which are crucial to the long-term sustainability of democratic deliberation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fear in lightening up on party political films is that the public will get misled, misinformed by distorted half-truths, riled up or driven to emotional distraction and unfortunate action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With free speech, we let in the good stuff as well as a good deal of rubbish.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, there must be a new social compact of trust between governor and governed that citizens will not, when speech laws are liberalised, embark upon Gullible&rsquo;s travels but will shoulder the burden of&nbsp; discernment in evaluating the content of the speech communicated by political films.&nbsp; Sometimes, parents have to let go and children have to assume responsibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, so too, \"personal responsibility is the price of liberty\".&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, lifting the blanket ban on party political films is of value to both speaker and hearer. To the voter is presented more information about politicians and their agendas.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

They can control their message, guard against misrepresentation and correct errors. &nbsp;This promotes accuracy and truth, two goals free speech is designed to serve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now to the nuts and bolts of this amendment.&nbsp; We speak to communicate, to reach the mind of others, to persuade conviction, which is of little worth unless</p> <p align=left>Column: 3386<p><p>it is converted into conduct.&nbsp; In relation to party political films, political persuasion is the name of the game and this must relate to garnering political support, including to influence voting outcomes.&nbsp; Making&nbsp; films which are intended to or are likely to affect elections would still be subject to section 33, it appears.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Amendment seeks to clarify what kind of film is directed towards a political end in Singapore in current section 2(a).&nbsp; This is, to say the least, an ambiguous category.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ambiguity is not a helpful guide to lawful behaviour&nbsp;&ndash; one virtue of the rule of law is providing a stable legal order which sustains a certain degree of predictability in one's environment.&nbsp; This enables us to make effective choices between all the options available to us.&nbsp; Making and exhibit party political films is an offence.&nbsp; If one cannot identify in advance what a party political film is, this may deter the making of films, which may be of great value.&nbsp; Expression will be chilled for fear of falling foul of the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under clause 2 of the Amendment, the Board of Film Censors is mandated to decide what constitutes a party political film for section 33 purposes.&nbsp; The proposed section 2(2)(b) removes the ban by providing that films relating to political matters may now be permitted if they are not partisan or biased.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existing section 2(2)(b) identifies&nbsp;seven examples of what a political matter is.&nbsp; This includes matters relating to elections, referenda, MPs, Government, political parties and policies.&nbsp; This is a description rather than a definition of political matter.&nbsp; It is pretty comprehensive and would seem to capture, if not colonise, the entire sphere of public life, politics, politicians and policies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The governing factor in liberalising this regime is to preserve an idealised vision of</p><p align=left>Column: 3387<p><p>elevated political debate which is rational and objective, by weeding out sensationalistic, emotionally manipulative films.&nbsp; Permissible films must be factual and objective; if they are distortive, this does not serve the free speech goals of advancing truth and accuracy of information in democratic debate.&nbsp; Emotion is verboten as it undermines this ideal.&nbsp; The model is a documentary rather than a reality show, dramatisation of a live or historical event or mockumentary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What criteria is provided to ascertain whether a film is partisan or biased?&nbsp; We are wading in a sea of grey, given the inherent subjectivity of this stipulation.&nbsp; Can a party political film be unbiased? &nbsp;Does not a film-maker have a message to convey, which is driven by his or her opinions and values?&nbsp; Even news coverage by licensed broadcasting services make value judgments just by dint of the choices of which stories are covered and how they are covered, how much face time is given to a politician or otherwise, whether a range of viewpoints are covered fairly and equitably or whether&nbsp;journalistic bias creeps in?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the opposite of bias is neutrality or impartiality, one must ask, is this even desirable, let alone possible?&nbsp; Can a party political film be neutral on political positions?&nbsp; Politicians must stand for something.&nbsp; This is how voters decide whether to stand with or walk away from them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, can a film on political matters be non-partisan?&nbsp; What is a partisan or non-partisan political matter?&nbsp; When is a matter political in nature?&nbsp; I can think of three types of politics at least.&nbsp; First, personal politics relates to personal ambition and the pursuit of power, for example, office politics.&nbsp; This sort of personal politics is not what the term party political refers to, I imagine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, partisan politics, which speaks to a certain kind of politics that</p><p align=left>Column: 3388<p><p>depends on formal or informal political alliances and party allegiances.&nbsp; This is the stuff of contemporary parliamentary politics.&nbsp; This would fall squarely into the term party political films.&nbsp; The attempt to portray one political party in a more favourable light, for example, either by promotional propaganda or by attacking one's competitor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third kind of politics may be characterised as ideological politics which relate to disparate stances on an issue, which is not party-based.&nbsp; For example, whether a libertarian or conservative approach is taken towards censorship, gambling or prostitution.&nbsp; This could also fall within the definition of a film directed towards a political end as section 2(b)(vi) relates to Government policies or issues of public controversy in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Minister speak to whether or not further guidelines will be provided, perhaps in a code or subsidiary legislation, as to what bias and partisan means?&nbsp; This will help whittle down subjectivity in the exercise of discretion in this matter.&nbsp; Perhaps some guidance can be drawn from the list of films exempted from treatment as a party political film.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The list of exceptions to the category of party political film in clause 3 is extended to include&nbsp;five more types of films.&nbsp; As I was reading the expanded section 2(3) listing, my first thought was that if there was a film about the Films Act, it might be called: \"No drama please, we are Singaporeans\" or \"the Importance of being Earnestly Serious?\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that record a lawful event, such as anniversary celebration videos by political parties fall within this exemption under section 2(3)(d), presumably because it is these serve as personal records.&nbsp; A political party may make a video in celebration of themselves, perhaps in hyberbolic terms, but this is</p><p align=left>Column: 3389<p><p>not meant for mass consumption and therefore will not pollute the well of public information meant to inform public debate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Live recordings of lawful events such as processions under section 2(3)(c) or documentary films under section 2(3)(e) providing accurate accounts of actual events, persons or situations are exempted provided such event, person or situation is not depicted in a dramatic way. &nbsp;Under sections 2(3)(f) and (g), films&nbsp; which contain a political party or politician's manifesto made by or on behalf of the candidates are also exempted provided they contain no animation and are shorn of dramatic elements.&nbsp; These are open-ended terms!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assessment of whether something is dramatically depicted will vary between \"<I>drama mamas</I>\" and those of a more phlegmatic bent.&nbsp; How do we measure drama?&nbsp; I appreciate that the intent is to regulate films which contain inaccuracies, convey false impressions or otherwise provoke irrational emotionalisms which precludes the finding of common ground which is so essential to the political enterprise.&nbsp; Could the Minister elaborate on how degrees of drama will be measured?&nbsp; Do we know it when we see it?&nbsp; For example, would a negative advertisement campaign against one's political opponent, subtly disguised or incorporated within the rational presentation of a political manifesto, qualify as an exemption?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, can he confirm that it falls to the Board of Film Censors to decide on whether a film is sufficiently undramatic so as to qualify as a section 2(3) exemption?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I note that section 35 which empowers the Minister to prohibit the possession or distribution of any film considered contrary to the public interest</p><p align=left>Column: 3390<p><p>still applies.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a catch-all clause, wide enough to catch party political films which the Board of Film Censors considers has passed the test of being non-partisan and unbiased. It is a very broad power. &nbsp;Will further guidelines be provided to limit the Minister's discretion in this respect, to prevent section 35 from being a backdoor way to ban films which are found to escape the jaws of section 33?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new section 4(a) empowers the Minister to appoint Advisory Committees to advise the Board of Film Censors. &nbsp;The Board may but is not required to consult with the Advisory Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Board can disregard the consultation.&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the point of creating an Advisory Committee if its views may be so easily discounted?&nbsp; It seems a little unnecessary, perhaps even a waste of time.&nbsp; If the point is citizen participation, I can appreciate the value of that.&nbsp; However, to allay any fear that the Advisory Committee will be peopled by many a reputable personage who will merely rubber stamp the Board's decisions, there must be a way to demonstrate that consultation has in fact taken place and that this is a meaningful process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the Minister consider adopting a rule requiring the gazetting of any disagreement between the Advisory Committee and Board and mandate that these bodies provide the basis for their reasoning?&nbsp; This will give the public a more transparent view of this kind of contestation taking place and promotes good governance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it appears that the existing Act and these amendments do not require the relevant decision makers, such as the Board of Film Censors and Committee of Appeal to give reasons for their decisions.&nbsp; Why not include a statutory duty to give reasons for their decisions, as a matter of good governance?&nbsp; This would also help </p><p align=left>Column: 3391<p><p>flesh out the contours of what is a permissible and non-permissible party political film.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we do not need a sledgehammer to crack a nut.&nbsp; More proportionate methods for restricting fundamental liberties are a good thing.&nbsp; I&nbsp;appreciate the prudence of a gradual, incremental approach towards section 33 and the move away from killing the message or chilling the messenger.&nbsp; Insofar as this Amendment marks a shift from absolute bans to a more calibrated form of regulating political speech where the Board acts as a kind of bouncer, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I propose to take the break now.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 4.15 pm.<p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"right\"><I>Sitting accordingly suspended</I></p><p align=\"right\"><I>at 3.54 pm until 4.15 pm.</I></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t<P><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.15 pm</em><p>&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3391<p></p><p align=\"center\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p></span></div></P>      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=\"center\"><strong>FILMS (AMENDMENT) BILL</strong></p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Debate resumed.</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong:</B> Mr Speaker Sir, this Bill is being introduced in the wake of the report&nbsp;by the Advisory Council on the Impact of New Media on Society (AIMS).&nbsp; AIMS made a total of 26 recommendations to the Government, including recommendations relating to sections 33 and 35 of the Films Act.&nbsp; In particular, AIMS recommended that section 33 be repealed in phases.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These recommendations pertaining to the Act were rejected by the Government.&nbsp; Instead, the Government announced some limited changes to the scope of section 33, while declining to amend Section 35 at all. This Bill introduces those limited changes to the scope of section 33.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3392<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my own view is that AIMS was fundamentally correct in recommending that section 33 be repealed.&nbsp; I am not sure if I agree with AIMS that the repeal should be conducted in phases, but that is now moot. &nbsp;Section 33 prohibits the making, distribution and exhibition of party political films. &nbsp;Section 2 adopts a broad definition of \"party political film\" that is overly-inclusive, that seeks to censor films based on their format and not on their substantive content, and this results in a potential chilling effect on film-makers. &nbsp;I remain unconvinced by the reasons for singling out film, when the printed word is equally capable of distortion and deception, when a well-written commentary can be even more powerful than a poorly-made film.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This prohibition on party political films is also easily and widely flouted in today&rsquo;s Web 2.0 world, and maintaining such an unenforceable prohibition simply promotes disrespect for the rule of law, which is an unhealthy state of affairs with insidious, far-reaching repercussions.&nbsp; Finally, Singaporeans are today far more sophisticated and media-savvy than before, and should be trusted to judge the merits and demerits of films for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be that as it may, the Government has made it clear that section 33 will not be repealed.&nbsp; Instead, this Bill seeks to make what seems like an incremental liberalisation, with an expanded list of films that are deemed not to be party political films.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even as the list seems to be expanded and longer, an important exception has been removed. The existing section 2(3)(a), which will be repealed, provides that films made by anyone solely for the purpose of reporting current affairs are not deemed to be party political films. This has been replaced by&nbsp;four specific, limited exceptions, namely, films made solely for the reporting of news by a </p><p align=left>Column: 3393<p><p>licensed broadcasting service; films recording \"live\" the whole or a material proportion of a lawful performance, assembly or procession that does not depict any event, person or situation in a dramatic way; films designed to provide a record of a lawful event or occasion, for its participants or persons connected with its participants; and documentary films without any animation and composed wholly of an accurate, non-dramatic account depicting actual events, persons or situations, which does not include unscripted or reality-type programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To my mind, these&nbsp;four specific exceptions are narrower in scope than the existing section 2(3)(a). For instance, what is the justification for limiting the exception for the reporting of news, to licensed broadcasters only?&nbsp; This seems completely incongruent with the Senior Minister of State's recognition of the realities in today&rsquo;s Web 2.0 world, and seems designed to inhibit the work of new media and citizen journalists and bloggers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, these&nbsp;four specific exceptions do not seem to represent a true liberalisation of the position on party political films, and in fact could narrow the scope of what is permissible.&nbsp; In particular, the prohibitions on recordings of unlawful events and occasions seems odd. &nbsp;This was not an issue that was canvassed at any point during AIMS&rsquo; deliberations.&nbsp; The holding of an unlawful event is prohibited under other existing laws, and it is not clear why the creation of a video recording of such an unlawful event should be illegal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also likely to create what can be called a nation of innocent criminals, eg, bystanders watching an assembly or procession may whip out their mobile phones to record videos of the event.&nbsp; They may not know whether the event</p><p align=left>Column: 3394<p><p>was being held in accordance with the law.&nbsp; If it was not, then they would be creating an illegal party political film.&nbsp; If they upload it to a website like YouTube, they would be distributing an illegal party political film.&nbsp; This is the precise problem that AIMS was constituted to address: laws that are out-of-sync with the times and that will invariably be ignored and flouted.&nbsp; So, why are we going out of our way to institute new legislation that we know will be disregarded and broken?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is arguable that the exception regarding documentary films that accurately depict actual persons and events, including unlawful events, could apply to the situation that I have just described. Yet, the term \"documentary film\" is not defined, and its use suggests that this exception requires the film to be something more than a mere video recording, since the term \"documentary film\" must necessarily be something more limited in scope than a \"film\", which is the term used in the other exceptions. &nbsp;This exception is also problematic&nbsp;&ndash; documentary-makers will invariably have to edit their raw footage, but such editing could potentially remove them from the scope of this exception.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new exceptions are also difficult from a lawyer&rsquo;s perspective.&nbsp; Prof. Thio has very ably and cogently pointed out the difficulties with section 33 from a constitutional perspective. On a more technical level, these amendments introduce terms that are not defined, in a way that makes their application of uncertain scope.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have&nbsp;already mentioned the term \"documentary film\" in the new section 2(3)(e).&nbsp; Other new terms of ambiguous scope include \"depiction in a dramatic way\" as used in the new sub-sections (3)(c) and (3)(e)(ii), and \"dramatic elements\" as used in the new sub-sections (3)(f) and (3)(g). It would have been preferable to define what they mean, so that courts seeking to interpret these terms will have some guidance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3395<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final point I would make on this Bill, is that it does not amend section 35, as recommended by AIMS.&nbsp; Section 35 allows the Minister to ban any film that he considers to be \"against the public interest\", without giving any reason.&nbsp; AIMS had recommended that the permissible reasons for banning films under section 35 be spelt out clearly, that an independent advisory panel be formed to advise the Minister before a film is banned under Section 35, and that the Minister be obliged to give reasons for the ban. &nbsp;All&nbsp;three proposals&nbsp;have been&nbsp;rejected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>status quo</I> gives the Minister broad powers to ban films, while not making him accountable for any decision banning a film.&nbsp; This is wholly imbalanced and does not pay sufficient respect to Singaporeans&rsquo; constitutional right to freedom of speech.&nbsp; While we all accept that limitations on constitutional rights do&nbsp;exist, we should also accept that such limitations must be calibrated and limited, and also transparent and accountable.&nbsp; Most of all, they must be constitutional, and limiting the grounds upon which films&nbsp;can be&nbsp;banned under section 35 as proposed by AIMS would go a long way towards ensuring the constitutionality of this provision and&nbsp;its use by the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True, in the only known instance of a ban under section 35, the Minister did give his reasons for doing so.&nbsp; But giving reasons is at the discretion of the Minister.&nbsp; My view is that since this is a limitation on a constitutional right, the proper position is to require the Minister to justify any ban under section 35, with an exception where the very disclosure of the justification could prejudice national security, in which case the Minister has to explicitly state that and give reasons where practicable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would normally welcome any liberalisation on matters of free speech.</p><p align=left>Column: 3396<p><p>But these amendments to the Films Act do not seem to represent a material or true liberalisation of the current position, and they are also potentially problematic in their phrasing.&nbsp; The objective in constituting AIMS was to review existing legislation in the face of advances in digital technology and to suggest necessary updates to the law.&nbsp; As I have said, it is not healthy to have laws on the books&nbsp;that are consistently and openly broken by Singaporeans.&nbsp; This is the reality with the existing regime under the Films Act.&nbsp; My belief is that it will also be the case with these present amendments, in which case, why bother?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Senior Minister of State&nbsp;has pointed out that the prohibition on party political films has an offline aspect as well, and that is true. &nbsp;But implicit in that is the acceptance that the amended prohibition on party political films will continue to be ignored online, and an admission that enforcement will continue to be absent in the&nbsp;online environment. &nbsp;But this is then an unjustifiable and unfair discriminatory practice&nbsp;against the offline population, in a sense that&nbsp;the prohibition is applied against them but not to the online citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this, I cannot support this Bill. &nbsp;It is bad law, it would not fix the problems that need to be fixed, and I cannot in good conscience support such a piece of legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I oppose this Bill.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> <p>Sir, it&nbsp;has been&nbsp;10 years since the Films Act was amended to ban political films.&nbsp; The 1998 amendment, carrying heavy penalties, was termed by some MPs then as harsh, vague and detrimental to our goal of becoming a First World country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late last&nbsp;year, the Advisory Council on the Impact of New Media on Society (AIMS) recommended that we should </p>  <p align=left>Column: 3397<p>  <p>work towards eventual repeal of section 33 of the Films Act altogether.&nbsp; As an interim measure, it recommended that step&nbsp;one be, to prohibit only those political films which were intentionally misleading.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be fair, I feel the Bill has some merits, but is still far from what the AIMS Committee had proposed.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current amendment will still leave many film-makers, civic-minded citizens and political parties confused and bewildered over the many limitations imposed on permissible political films.&nbsp; The Bill suggests that the Government is still somewhat&nbsp;paranoid when it comes to opening up the political landscape.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, in the amendment to section 2(2)(a) and (b), the issue on whether a political film is biased or partisan is now clearly dependent only on the opinion of the Board of Film Censors.&nbsp; By contrast, the AIMS committee had recommended that the Board should not exercise the function which should be passed to a group of independent adjudicators comprising of citizens of high standing with public respect.&nbsp; Instead, the new section 4A allows the Government to appoint 'Advisory Committees' (the PFCC) to advise the Board on such matters; however, the section makes it clear that the Board can override the views of the PFCC.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to begin with, most films, political or not, carry the values of the maker or author, which may not be shared by others.&nbsp; Miss Tan Pin Pin, an award winning director, wrote on behalf of 10 other film-makers to the <I>Straits Times</I> in 2005, questioning what constitutes 'bias' in making political&nbsp;films.&nbsp; She said, \"all works of art are the expression of the artiste&rsquo;s opinion, which may favour a </p><p align=left>Column: 3398<p><p>particular viewpoint or argument over another\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that the ambit of what is permissible will be ambiguous and uncertain.&nbsp; If we are sincere about promoting diversity of opinion, why have the restriction?&nbsp; There is no need to treat Singaporeans like children.&nbsp; They can assess for themselves whether the views or messages in a film are reasonable or not.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if the ban on biased and partisan films remains, film-makers and the public should have a clear understanding of how the Board and Advisory Committee evaluate films.&nbsp; To add transparency to this assessment process, can it be mandated that for each film that is banned, the opinions of both the Advisory Committee and the Board be made public?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 2(c) expands the list of permissible films, which is a small step forward. &nbsp;However, the unnecessary limitation placed on some of these films is a giant step backwards for political engagement, artistic freedom and active citizenry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the proposed sub-section 3(c) of the Films Act allows only the recording of events that are held in accordance with the law.&nbsp; Therefore, any unrelated bystander caught filming a protest on a cellphone could be prosecuted.&nbsp; To me, this does not make sense.&nbsp; Citizen journalism is a useful counterpoint to the official mass media.&nbsp; Singaporeans should be informed of what is going on within our borders, whether legal or not.&nbsp; The Government has stated that it wants to engage the online community seriously.&nbsp; If that is so, it must allow the recording of events, whether held in accordance with the law or not, because such&nbsp;events are essential to the growth of the blogging community and independent news portals.&nbsp; Furthermore,</p><p align=left>Column: 3399<p><p>these are mostly recordings of events that the mainstream media is not interested to cover.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the ban on the use of animation and dramatic elements is another strange restriction imposed on political films that should be discarded.&nbsp; First, animation aids story-telling.&nbsp; Secondly, dramatisation is the essence of story-telling for any serious and creative film-maker.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is somewhat ironic that the theme&nbsp;of the&nbsp;2007/08 Media Development Authority&rsquo;s Annual Report was \"The Digital Way Forward: An Animation Special\".&nbsp; The MDA Report identified animation as a key growth area for development.&nbsp; So, what kind of catastrophic harm can a promising technology inflict on the public when applied to a political film?<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is animated text permissible?&nbsp; Are special effects allowed?&nbsp; If nothing can be animated in a political production, why call it a film?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

If the Government is worried about viewers being carried away, the Government can simply require all films to carry a mandatory disclaimer urging viewers of political films or documentaries to draw their own conclusions.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Senior Minister of State to seriously consider removing this incomprehensible restriction on the use of animation and dramatic elements on political films completely.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the 1998 Amendment fixed the penalty for those who make or exhibit political films at a maximum of $100,000 fine or two years' jail or both.&nbsp; This is indeed a very heavy penalty.&nbsp; With the easing of the ban on political films, and the uncertain boundaries mentioned, </p><p align=left>Column: 3400<p><p>should the penalties for political films not be lowered as well?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier in the second reading speech, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that the Election Advertising Regulations would be amended.&nbsp; He also mentioned that there would be no blackout period on new films during the election campaign, ie, political activists and parties can produce new films during the election period.&nbsp; I would like to seek a clarification from him on this, in the sense that during the campaign period, the timelines are usually very urgent and would there be a mechanism such that the requirement for submission to the PFCC before approval would be waived during the election period?&nbsp; Otherwise the delay caused there might render the films, in a sense, ineffective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a final point to note.&nbsp; We have allowed controversial political films&nbsp;like Fahrenheit 911 to air here.&nbsp; Members may recall that that film was made by American Michael Moore, heavily critical of the then&nbsp;President George W Bush and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.&nbsp; By allowing the film in cinemas here, can we then infer that the Government will allow something similar with local content to be produced and aired here as well?&nbsp; If not, is the Government saying that it is all right to laugh at other leaders in the world but not at our own?<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, the ability to take criticism and laugh at one self is a sign of a society's maturity and magnanimity and&nbsp;I urge the Government to adopt&nbsp;such qualities and accept&nbsp;films as nothing more than an expression of diverse opinion in a healthy democracy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, Singapore has a high literacy rate and high Internet connectivity.&nbsp; Singaporeans have&nbsp; many channels to obtain and verify official and unofficial information.&nbsp; There are also many laws in place such as the defamation laws, Penal Code and Sedition Act to catch content </p><p align=left>Column: 3401<p><p>which is objectionable.&nbsp; Our society should be ready for and work towards the removal of the ban on political films altogether, in other words repealing&nbsp;section 33 of the Act.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, I welcome the liberalisation of the Films Act.&nbsp; This marks a nuanced shift by this Government in relation to film censorship.&nbsp; It is a recognition of the need to adjust to the changing media landscape and the people&rsquo;s desire for more political space.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is important to have a sense of history and media trends to understand the significance of this shift. &nbsp;Film censorship did not start in 1980 with the Films Act as some Members of this House seem to think.&nbsp; Film censorship, indeed, had existed during the British colonial days and it had always been stricter than that of publications for the simple reason that film, being audio-visual, had a greater impact and reached more people, compared to publications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publications at that time reached out to only the literate and better-educated people which formed a far smaller group than the film-goers. &nbsp;In 1959, when the PAP came into power, the literacy rate was only about 50%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before TV was introduced in Singapore in 1963, films were screened in cinemas&nbsp;and outdoor theatres.&nbsp; Until 1963, film censorship was under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which was at the time focused on containing the Communists and their propaganda. &nbsp;Film censorship was transferred to the Culture Ministry with the advent of TV.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those early years, among the political films which were banned were those which extolled Communism, and for good reason. &nbsp;Communism was on the march in the region, and the Malayan</p><p align=left>Column: 3402<p><p>Communist Party was a ruthless force to be reckoned with. While rational political debate was the PAP&rsquo;s first weapon of choice, the same could not be said for the Communists, who believed in the violent overthrow of government.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the years, as the political landscape changed and became more stable, film censorship has become more sophisticated and relaxed.&nbsp; Our population has also become better-educated. &nbsp;Our literacy rate&nbsp;is now 96 per cent. &nbsp;Almost everyone owns a television set, and many also have a DVD player.&nbsp; Indeed many have their own home theatres at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest change in recent years, of course, is the pervasiveness of the Internet, which has radically changed the way political battles are fought the world over.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these changes, however, two underlying premises regarding film and political debate remain unchanged.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is that, because the medium is audio-visual, it can evoke a visceral response in the audience. &nbsp;It follows that&nbsp;political films that intentionally distort the truth, that mislead the public and incite them to rise up in misguided anger should be kept out.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second premise is that political debate in Singapore should be rational, responsible and reasoned as far as possible.&nbsp; Hence, sensational political films that appeal to the baser instincts of people and that confuse and trivialise political debate should be discouraged.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, first, I would like to make clear that I agree with the broad principles.&nbsp; While we want to widen the political space in Singapore, it should be done in such a way that it reaps an overall benefit for our society and its political development, and not lead to its detriment.</p><p align=left>Column: 3403<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not, as some critics might say, to preserve the PAP&rsquo;s power, rather it is to preserve the rational political environment that we have painstakingly built up over the years in Singapore, and which has served Singapore well. And it is not about laughing at ourselves or, as Ms Sylvia Lim said, the ability to take criticism.&nbsp; It is about building up a certain political environment that has served Singapore well.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, I fully support the move to amend the Films Act to allow for only certain types of party political films&nbsp;&ndash; that which are factual and objective, and do not dramatise or present a distorted picture of our political reality.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By allowing such fact-based films, even if their content may prove controversial, they can serve as a starting point for rational discussion and debate.&nbsp; I hope film-makers will use this opportunity and this liberalisation to make more films of this nature that will promote reasoned political debate and add insight.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With greater activity and focus on such films, it will, hopefully, also marginalise the kind of sensational and outrageous political videos that we now find on the Internet which is why I now support this amendment.&nbsp; In response to what some Members say&nbsp;&ndash; that it is no sense having this Films Act because it can be circumvented on the Internet&nbsp;&ndash; my argument is that it is an important signal and it will, hopefully, serve to marginalise the kind of videos that we now see on the Internet.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A look at some Singapore political videos on the Internet show that a rational political environment is not dominant.&nbsp; The content of the political videos is designed to appeal to people&rsquo;s volatile emotions rather than their reason.&nbsp; They distort with visual innuendoes.&nbsp; They oversimplify with no regard to context.</p><p align=left>Column: 3404<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One such video on the Internet, for example, showed an opposition politician preaching civic disobedience and using his young innocent children to win public sympathy for his campaign.&nbsp; It is highly emotive.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such political films find refuge in the Internet and their makers enjoy a certain underground notoriety that wins them a following.&nbsp; They feed on the conspiracy that this Government stifles dissent and runs a police state.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They spin the story that there are plots in Government to go after them, that its leaders indulge in duplicity and intrigue, that all power is traced to a few absolutely evil and omnipotent men.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They juxtapose one set of facts with another and say they must be related.&nbsp; All these innuendoes in all their complexities appear highly mysterious to the general public.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paranoid mentality, however, is one that does not listen to logic.&nbsp; Its reasoning requires several, sometimes wild, leaps into the imagination. Yet the film-maker is dexterous enough to keep the storyline on such a level as to make it all seem true and logical.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which leads to a basic question: Why are such political videos and films made, although they are presently illegal, and loaded up on the Internet?&nbsp; The answer seems fairly clear: Because they can.&nbsp; And also, on the Internet, an audience for such sensational political entertainment exists.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My view is that such political films based on distortion of facts make no contribution to enhancing the conditions of this country&rsquo;s political reality.&nbsp; Instead, they coarsen and lower the standards of political discourse.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this amendment to the Films Act is a relaxation, but listening to the </p><p align=left>Column: 3405<p><p>arguments of some Members of the House, the concern seems to be it is, in fact, not a relaxation but a clamping down.&nbsp; I ask assurance from the Senior Minister of State that this is not so.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I would argue that the steps taken in this amendment in fact are quite bold and I have seen many films including from Miss Tan Pin Pin, the film maker named by Ms Sylvia Lim, and many of them take issue with Government policies, even entertaining films like Jack Neo's \"Money Not Enough No. 2\", which used animation to put out ERP gantries which are thrown by a mob into the sea are shown without any great fuss by the official circles.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Government is already ruling with a light touch. And I am quite sure that the intent of this law is to liberalise further and not to further make it more difficult for film makers to express themselves but in ways that will add insight, that will add to a reasoned debate and not mislead and distort the truth.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State for an assurance that the independence of the new advisory panel.&nbsp; In assessing films, it should be transparent and fair, and seen to be so.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its decisions should be made public and explained.&nbsp; Opportunities should also be given to the film-maker to re-edit the film, based on the committee&rsquo;s comments, and resubmit it for approval. Otherwise, it will merely stir the unhealthy imagination of those who feed on conspiracy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear Prof. Thio Li-ann and Mr Siew Kum Hong talk in terms of freedom of speech.&nbsp; I think that is a worthy topic but I would urge the Members to, perhaps, move a separate motion on freedom of speech and deal with it holistically to do with publications, films and all other</p><p align=left>Column: 3406<p><p>media, and not use that argument for the Films Act which is one aspect of freedom of speech.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it is, in a way, confusing the debate to bring in what you call \"a constitutional right\" to freedom of speech. All of us value the freedom of speech.&nbsp; The question is: What serves society?&nbsp; And it is up to this society to decide what limits we place, what we think is valuable.&nbsp; I think it merits a deeper and wider debate.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the panel, it is important to ensure that the committee consists of non-partisan people of standing, especially established historians who understand that history can sometimes be interpreted in various ways.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not unusual for documentaries, for example, to take different historical perspectives and even challenge the prevailing one. The important thing is that they are based on rigorous research and facts.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I note that the Chairman for the new committee is the retired Senior District Judge Richard Magnus. Can I ask the Senior Minister of State how the Government decided on this particular retired judge for this role?&nbsp; Not that I doubt its judgment but I think it is good for the public to know on what basis does the Government decide that this person is non-partisan and an independent person to chair this important panel.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides being even-handed, the panel should be expeditious in its decisions in processing a film.&nbsp; This will prevent it from being accused of holding up a film unnecessarily, or of applying double standards.&nbsp; Is there an estimated time frame for party political films to go through the process? &nbsp;And how will the&nbsp;panel work during an election campaign, given the timeframe?</p><p align=left>Column: 3407<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is important to make sure that the panel can, itself, withstand the test of public scrutiny in its application of the amended law.&nbsp; This is after all a liberalisation, and should be seen as such.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad:</B> Mr Speaker, I believe the amendments to the Films Act are timely, to widen the usage of films for political purposes, and loosening the regulations to keep pace with times.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can understand why there was a need to be cautious as far as films are concerned.&nbsp; This is a medium that can easily sway the emotions of people.&nbsp; However, the proliferation of the new media and the ease to get films produced and distributed outside of Singapore also signals that local regulations are becoming less and less effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans, especially the younger generation, are getting used to having access to a variety of films and media content&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;within and beyond our shores.&nbsp; Thus, we need to keep in step with these developments.&nbsp; Therefore, these proposed changes are a good first step in recognising this trend, and that the Government is willing to listen, respond and manage the variety of alternative views and messaging from the media.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this will benefit our political landscape in Singapore.&nbsp; I believe the deregulation of this space will be beneficial not just to the opposition and neutral groups, but also for the ruling party to keep in step and further its causes in the arena.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope for the Government to relax the regulations beyond the non-dramatised film documentaries as well as footage from legal events.&nbsp; I think that films are a good way to get people to understand and appreciate political affairs from different perspectives.&nbsp; Stifling such creative works will limit the outreach for political discussion and thought provocation.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3408<p><p>Today, many international movies portray political figures whose actions in histories are interpreted in different ways that enable viewers to reflect on moral issues, values and societal concerns in relation to politics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Government always cites movies in the likes of Farenheit 9/11 that we must be wary of, where would films like Nixon/Frost, JFK&nbsp;&ndash; highly-acclaimed, political themed, commercial films&nbsp;&ndash; be if not for a film-maker's interpretation of events around political figures and provoking the thoughts of the people?&nbsp; Through this medium, we can also tell our Singapore story and our political struggles of individuals and political parties for our young and future generations to reflect on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are certainly merits for the Government to further loosen this Act because such films are also important to a nation's heritage. &nbsp;Over time, it helps keep citizens engaged on Singapore's past and history, which sometimes documentaries are not able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;as there is always a human element to the story.&nbsp; So my concern is:&nbsp;to what extent can we allow space for film-makers and give them the creative licence for them to produce such films?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly,&nbsp;we can&nbsp;see that the authorities still maintain a conservative stand with regard to two categories:&nbsp;(i) party political films; and (ii) films deemed to be against the public interest.&nbsp; The Government may have its own reasons for this, but it still has grey areas that are not helpful to anyone trying to make political videos.&nbsp; I think what many are asking for is greater clarity on the OB markers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of OB markers, my concern lies with the PFCC.&nbsp; This panel does not just deal with content with respect to public interest but there is political sensitivity involved.&nbsp; I think questions will also arise on who sets the</p><p align=left>Column: 3409<p><p>rules on the selection on what films are accepted and what are not, and what are the definitions of the political OB markers, if any.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be many interpretations as mentioned by my other esteemed colleagues on the technical issue of dramatisation and the interpretation of events.&nbsp; The definition of dramatic elements is not clear and may turn out to be a technical no-go for films being produced for political purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to the PFCC, I agree with Ms Irene Ng that they must remain independent and that the decisions must be made transparent.&nbsp; I think the selection of the panelists will also be crucial to the acceptance of the PFCC's role and judgment in this process.&nbsp; I fear scepticism in this de-regulation process if the Chairman and members of the PFCC are seen to be pro-establishment or have come from the Government in their previous roles.&nbsp; I also fear conservatism&nbsp;by the panel given that this is the first time we are relaxing the laws in this manner and the danger of their objectivity being hijacked by lobbyists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pertaining to the use of films for elections purposes, I think that this will create a more vibrant run-up to the elections campaign.&nbsp; The changes effectively remove&nbsp;handcuffs from real political parties&nbsp;&ndash; like the PAP&nbsp;&ndash; with an interest to engage citizens through films and Internet.&nbsp; It is also important for parties, such as the PAP, to set the tone for its legal use and play by the rules.&nbsp; As a PAP MP, I think that we have always been hampered in this space as a result, compared to the many instances of politically-motivated groups circumventing the existing rules through the online media.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I still think that there are two areas where&nbsp;we&nbsp;can relax further.&nbsp; In </p><p align=left>Column: 3410<p><p>section 33, the Government still continues to criminalise the making of party political films in general.&nbsp; This may be perceived to be a backdoor for the Government to take action against errant producers of such films. &nbsp;What are the safeguards for producers who fail to make the grade through the PFCC from being charged for making such films?&nbsp; They are technically still guilty of making a party political film that is not within the legal framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under section 35 of the Films Act, a film can be considered to be against the public interest and the film&nbsp;can still be banned.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has only been invoked&nbsp;once since it was enacted and we have the Sedition Act and the Penal Code to deal with&nbsp;any material&nbsp;against public interest. &nbsp;Is this section still relevant, given the other safeguards in place?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to section 35, should we reconsider if a Minister should hold the power to ban party political&nbsp;films, as he is also a political figure from a political party?&nbsp; From a politically neutral point of view, should the Government consider letting the judiciary arm, or an independent panel hold this authority?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the times, the Government needs to evolve and be able to accept a diversity of films and opinions.&nbsp; That is the key to show that Singapore has matured and that we are ready to go head-on to show that our Government is honest and transparent.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think the amendment is taking us in the right direction.&nbsp; The Government must continue to step up to engage, articulate and explain its policies and action to the people so that it can better accept alternative points of view or interpretation of history and current affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must have more faith in our society to be able to distinguish acceptable political ideologies.&nbsp; Singaporeans are now better educated and more matured.&nbsp; We need to continually</p> <p align=left>Column: 3411<p><p>engage them and allow them to weigh different arguments&nbsp;and reach their own conclusions.&nbsp; This means having a Government that is comfortable in addressing misinformation and alternative perspectives, and allowing Singaporeans to decide for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may well be, at the end of the day,&nbsp;a case such as the relaxation of demonstration rules at the Hong Lim Park.&nbsp; In the past, we had loud calls from various corners of the local and international interest groups for us to relax the regulations.&nbsp; The Government relaxed the rules, and things are still&nbsp;peaceful today&nbsp;with very little interest in what goes on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me thank all the speakers who have spoken on the amendments to the Bill.&nbsp; The majority of them have expressed their support to the amendments that have been tabled.&nbsp; Some have done so with strong support and some are quietly applauding the amendments that we have made but they have all raised interesting perspectives and questions.&nbsp; Let me try and package them together and address some of them.&nbsp; I will do so along three limbs.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the intent of the Bill, if I may borrow the structure from Miss Penny Low who spoke first.&nbsp; Second, the content of the Bill and, third, the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually dwelt on the intent&nbsp;at some length&nbsp;in the Second Reading speech and so I hope to be brief on this particular aspect.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the contents of the Bill&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;to explain a little more on sections 33 and 35, although that is not part of the amendments, as well as address some of the points that have been raised: being partisan, biased, animation, dramatisation and the use of some of these words.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3412<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third is to try and explain more clearly what the process is with regard to the submission of a film to the Board of Film Censors (BFC) and how this will be subsequently treated with the formation, if the Bill is passed,&nbsp;of the Political Films Consultative Committee (PFCC).&nbsp; And, although Members have not brought this point up, the final appeal authority which is the Films Appeal Committee (FAC), and their decision being final on whether the film is a party political film.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me deal with the intent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members, by and large, have recognised that while the films will be a useful medium to communicate messages to reach out to the young and&nbsp;a particular segment of the society,&nbsp;there are also downsides to the film that it can mislead and distort, and&nbsp;there are certain emotive appeals that the film can make which could be damaging.&nbsp; My take on this is that if our democracy is reduced to slick commercials, clever editing, sharp sound bites and political spin, then I think our democracy is being debased.&nbsp; So I would say that when we crafted this, we were very much aware of the need to make sure that even as we liberalise&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;here, I want to give the assurance to the point that was raised by Ms Irene Ng that indeed this is meant as a liberalisation of the space that we have today with regard to the use of films&nbsp;&ndash; that we continue to want to make sure that the debate is serious,&nbsp;robust and&nbsp;rational.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is that I think films have a mass appeal that books and texts do not have.&nbsp; When we are watching a film together has a different appeal then if we&nbsp;watch it on television or over the Internet.&nbsp; And even if an individual watching films over the Internet gets worked up and very emotional, it is one person on his or her own, whereas a group of people coming together watching a film that has an emotive appeal coupled </p><p align=left>Column: 3413<p><p>with commentary and incendiary remarks,&nbsp;the damage can be potentially catastrophic.&nbsp; So, what we are doing here, as far as the intent of the Bill goes, is to take a careful, calculated, calibrated approach to liberalising to include more categories under the segments that will be exempted from being party political films.&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I have said earlier in the Second Reading that we will make further changes when it is appropriate to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof.&nbsp;Thio Li-ann had also queried about the Bill vis-a-vis Article 14(2) of the Constitution and I know that Ms Irene Ng had suggested to her and others to table a proper motion to debate this.&nbsp; I am not a constitutional expert but my take on this is that I am fairly sure that this must have been deliberated quite extensively by our predecessors when the Bill was first moved in 1998.&nbsp; But, again, back to the fundamentals and&nbsp;principles which&nbsp;are to keep our political debates rational, non-emotive and&nbsp;serious to preserve the integrity of the election process, I think disallowing certain types of films does not affect the overall freedom of political debate in Singapore.&nbsp; My take is that there are sufficient avenues for political parties and&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;to get their views&nbsp;and manifestos across to the public. &nbsp;They can rely on the mainstream media.&nbsp; They can publish magazines, print newspapers if they are licensed to do so, host web pages online as well as debate&nbsp;about such issues in Parliament.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.56 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on now to talk a little bit about the content of the Bill.&nbsp; Let me say, first of all, that in coming up with such amendments and what we proposed to do, we have got to strike a balance between the prescriptive and the</P><p align=left>Column: 3414<p><p>descriptive.&nbsp; We cannot be overly prescriptive, trying to tighten every loophole, trying to spell out to the <I>nth</I> degree what is permissible and what is not because it is not possible to do so.&nbsp; And certainly, in addition to the many examples that have been given, I am sure the creative film makers will also be able to find other ways to circumvent what we prescribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;What we try to do in the Bill is to set out certain parameters that I think would quite clearly indicate what is acceptable and what is not.&nbsp; But beyond being descriptive, we must also describe the intent of the Bill&nbsp;&ndash; what we hope that it will do, what we want it to achieve, what kind of guidance this will give to the people who eventually have to exercise judgment on whether a film is a party political film (PPF).&nbsp; So we are trying to strike a balance in the amendments as well as in this debate, together with the Second Reading speech,&nbsp;between being prescriptive and being descriptive.&nbsp; My second point is that I think it is worthwhile for films to be viewed in context and in totality: dramatisation and&nbsp;animation, is it partisan?&nbsp; Is it biased?&nbsp; Rather than picking out specific aspects of it and querying over certain segments of the film alone, I think it is important for those who are viewing such films to do so in the right context and in its totality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point is that at the end of the day, notwithstanding some comments that have been made about this being an art and not a science,&nbsp;there is always going to be an element of subjectivity in assessing whether such films are PPFs or not.&nbsp; And we have&nbsp;to trust the process and the people selected to help us bring that process forward and I shall touch on this later.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me deal with some of the words that have been used, \"being partisan\", \"biased\", \"animation\" and \"dramatisation\".&nbsp; Let me assure the House that simply having actors to portray a certain role will not cause a film to fall out of the amendments that are permitted.&nbsp; Limbs</P> <p align=left>Column: 3415<p><p>which allow for \"live\" recordings and documentary as long as the film does not sensationalise.&nbsp; For example, if you want to have a documentary on somebody who has passed on and he had been a political figure prominent in the political scene in Singapore, we will need an actor to re-enact important episodes in his life but, again, the intent is not to allow distortion so the dramatisation is permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the distortion, if it takes place, will be what the BFC, PFCC and&nbsp;FAC will be most concerned about.&nbsp; Some degree of animation is also something that we will have to look at because if in a party manifesto, we are describing the future of Singapore, we have got to be able to depict it in a way that people can understand,&nbsp;visualise and&nbsp;be excited over.&nbsp; We have done so for the National Art Gallery.&nbsp; It came to mind, as I was listening to the Members, that part of it had to depict what was not yet in place, how we&nbsp;are going to transform those few things into something that, hopefully, will captivate the attention of Singaporeans and visitors alike.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And I dare say that some animation is going to be permissible in bringing forward the message of how we intend Singapore to be, going forward.&nbsp; But, again, the extent of the animation&nbsp;&ndash; does it distort, does it mislead&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;will be something that the BFC and the PFCC will have to exercise judgment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me touch on sections 33 and 35 because I think many Members have spoken out and raised issues regarding these two particular areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Thio Li-ann, Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Siew Kum Hong, Ms Sylvia Lim, amongst others, spoke on section 33, why are we not decriminalising the making of party political film as recommended by AIMS.&nbsp; Our position is that the Government is only disallowing what would be dramatised, sensationalised and&nbsp;emotive party political films which will do harm to rational and objective political debate.&nbsp; And so we feel that there is strong reason to maintain the sanction against the making of such films.&nbsp; But bear in mind</p><p align=left>Column: 3416<p><p>also that while we retain this clause, and we have always had this clause since the inception of the Bill, we have not prosecuted anyone for the making of a PPF to date.&nbsp; That is an important point, that while it is retained, it is there and has been there over the last 10 years,&nbsp;there has been no move to&nbsp;prosecute anybody.&nbsp; So moving forward, whether or not a film-maker will be prosecuted for the making of a PPF, it is not an automatic process but it will have to depend on the facts and&nbsp;the significance and the merits of each case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 35: Again, same Members have raised their issues and comments on section 35.&nbsp; Let me clarify a misconception that this is a so-called backdoor way to catch the rest of the films that would otherwise have passed, because section 35 is not against PPFs; it is not to be used against party political films.&nbsp; PPFs, unless they fall under the exceptions, will already be banned from the onset and there is no need to apply section 35 to such films.&nbsp; Section 35 is meant and reserved for serious situations where due to the circumstances of the day, the possession or distribution of the film would actually be contrary to public interest -&nbsp;presenting a threat to national security, danger to racial or religious harmony, and perhaps affecting even the very fabric of our multi-racial, multi-cultural society.&nbsp; Members have noted that so far, we have only used section 35 once and that was on \"<I>Zahari's 17 Years</I>\", and the Minister had come up with a press statement to fully explain why he issued the ban.&nbsp; We did not want to impose on the Minister the need to make such a press statement or to have to explain every time he exercises the jurisdiction to impose such a ban.&nbsp; But, where possible, he will indeed do so.&nbsp; But for those who have forgotten what \"<I>Zahari's 17 Years</I> \" was all about, the film was&nbsp;a revisionist attempt to have a distorted and misleading portrayal of Zahari's arrest and detention.&nbsp; It was an attempt to exculpate himself from his </p><p align=left>Column: 3417<p><p>involvement in communist activities against the interest of Singapore.&nbsp; He had posed a security threat for which he was detained under the ISA, and he now wanted to exploit the use of film to project false and distorted picture of his past actions, and that is why the ban was made.&nbsp; It was not a political film.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also comments as to whether this signals any change with regard to the way we view the Internet.&nbsp; Let me explain our position with regard to films on the Internet.&nbsp; First of all, the Films Act governs both offline and online films.&nbsp; But the Government had decided to adopt a three-pronged approach towards regulating the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we say we will take a light-touch approach via the class licence scheme.&nbsp; Second, that we will couple this with public education and, indeed, we followed up on one of the AIMS' recommendations to have inter-Ministry cyber-wellness taskforce.&nbsp; Because we recognise that public education really would&nbsp;lay the foundation for further moves to expand the political space in this area, and to make sure that people exercise the right degree of discernment, judgment, to view things not in isolation but to be able to see things in totality, to recognise the larger picture and not to be misled by seductive arguments narrowly focused on a particular area.&nbsp; And the third limb, besides light touch and public education, was industry's self-regulation and co-regulation.&nbsp; And, basically, we will not deviate from this, going forward.&nbsp; Films that are available on the Internet will have to continue to abide by the class licence scheme as in the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So enough on the intent and the content of the Bill.&nbsp; Let me move on to talk a little bit more about the process because I think there were some queries and concerns.&nbsp; Let me say, first of all, that today the Board of Film Censors</p><p align=left>Column: 3418<p><p>(BFC) decides.&nbsp; The BFC takes a look at the film and if it deems it to be a party political film, it decides and it rejects the classification and prohibits it from being exhibited.&nbsp; That is for political films.&nbsp; For the rest of the films, it will decide those that are clear-cut&nbsp;&ndash; and about 90% of the films that it receives are largely clear-cut in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 10% will be sent to the Films Consultative Panel for their views and their input.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The BFC received about 750 films and about 16,000 videos in 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighty per cent&nbsp;of the films were classified within&nbsp;seven days.&nbsp; Ten percent of the films, again, more contentious, they sent it to the FCP for the views of members and for their input and assessments to be made, and they completed the process within the space of about one month.&nbsp; So, that is the time taken.&nbsp; For videos, because of the load generated by 16,000 videos, it took longer.&nbsp; About 40% of the videos were classified within two weeks.&nbsp; The rest took longer and those that have to be sent to the FCP came back within about two months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on before I come to the FAC later.&nbsp; What will change now is that with the formation of the PFCC, if the Bill is passed, films that the BFC deems to be political in nature, instead of rejecting it,&nbsp;it will now send it to PFCC.&nbsp; And PFCC, with its&nbsp;six to&nbsp;eight members plus the chairman, will then give their views and input, and this will come back to BFC before BFC makes the final decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Composition of the PFCC has not yet been decided obviously, until the Bill is passed, but we have already announced that Mr Richard Magnus will be the Chair of the Committee.&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng asked why we selected Mr Richard Magnus, I think he is somebody we know well,&nbsp;retired Senior District Judge, has a distinguished career and established reputation, known for his impartiality.&nbsp; He will form the Committee, as I said, and the Committee will then be appointed by</p><p align=left>Column: 3419<p><p>the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts.&nbsp; And this Committee, together with the BFC, will then make the decision on whether a film is a PPF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What has shifted from our present position is that we are actually taking a more community-based consultative process.&nbsp; In the past, civil servants, BFC decides.&nbsp; Right now, we involve the PFCC comprising private sector individuals, as well as refer the films to the Films Appeal Committee (FAC) should there be an appeal by an aggrieved owner of the film.&nbsp; The FAC has, over the course of the last&nbsp;five years or so, listened to 10 appeals from aggrieved owners who disagreed with the BFC's decisions.&nbsp; The FAC overturned the BFC's decision on&nbsp;six of those occasions and upheld the BFC's decision on&nbsp;four other occasions.&nbsp; And the BFC accepted the Films Appeal Committee's decision as final and went along with the FAC's final decision on the determination of the classification of the film.&nbsp; That was for commercial films; the same process will now be used for films that are deemed as PPFs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is a certain confidence, I hope, to give to Members that, firstly, the composition of the PFCC, a new entity, will comprise people who are non-partisan, who are serious-minded, who will exercise sound independent judgment.&nbsp; The BFC will take their views into consideration but cannot always abide by their views, just as the BFC cannot abide solely by the views of the PFCC, and let me explain why.&nbsp; Today, the FCP has about 65 members.&nbsp; We seek their views, not everybody responds, but for those members who respond, we consider all their views.&nbsp; Where the views are clearly in one direction, it is quite easy for BFC to make a certain decision.&nbsp; Where it is more finely balanced, the BFC will then have to take into consideration the individual views that are expressed and come to a conclusion, and make its decision accordingly.&nbsp; We do not yet know how the </p></p<p align=left>Column: 3420<p><p>process with the PFCC will work out because it has not quite been formed yet, nor do we know how long it will take, a point, I think, that was raised also by Ms Sylvia Lim.&nbsp; We will know better but we know that the formation of a separate PFCC will actually smoothen the process because, otherwise, all films will join the same queue and be submitted to the FCP for consideration, together with the rest of the commercial films and videos.&nbsp; So this will be an opportunity to try and move what are deemed party political films, to be considered more quickly by a panel that is independent and for their views to be made known.&nbsp; Ultimately, as I have said earlier, there will be a certain degree of judgment, always an element of subjectivity in their decision-making, and they will have to apply and interpret the parameters that have been spelt out in this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also queries on whether the BFC or the PFCC should make their views and positions public.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what will happen is that owners who submit the film to the BFC will have a chance to interact with the BFC should the conclusion and the decision be not in their interest and be adverse to what they would otherwise expect.&nbsp; And if they then edit the film and take into consideration the comments given by BFC, then the film can be submitted afresh to the BFC for reconsideration.&nbsp; Otherwise, if they are unhappy and aggrieved by the decision of the BFC, as I said earlier, there is always the opportunity to bring their case to the FAC and FAC will hear it independently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have basically dealt with some of the main queries that were raised by Members.&nbsp; Let me say categorically that the amendments that this Bill proposes bring about what I believe to be significant liberalisation and change, and it will widen the space for political discourse and engagement, particularly through the medium of film and videos and, I hope, over time, to enable a more robust and</p><p align=left>Column: 3421<p><p>vibrant political environment.&nbsp; But at the same time, I think we must be mindful and indeed careful to maintain the integrity of our electoral process and continue to keep our political discourse serious, rational and robust.&nbsp; We are fully aware that technological and societal landscape will change and&nbsp;continue to evolve.&nbsp; We are committed to ensuring that our rules will remain relevant and that they keep pace with time.&nbsp; We will make further changes when it is appropriate to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(Amendment) Bill introduces a licensing scheme for importers of essential construction materials.&nbsp; Through licensing, we seek to achieve two objectives, namely, to ensure that imported materials meet requisite quality standards, and to enhance the supply resilience of such materials to Singapore.&nbsp; Let me explain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, BCA administratively requires concreting sand and granite that are imported via its aggregate terminals to undergo certain quality tests.&nbsp; We will formalise the testing requirements as conditions under the licensing scheme.&nbsp; This will give BCA the proper legislative authority to impose these requirements on importers of essential construction materials.&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be no additional cost to the industry arising from formalising these requirements, since they are already imposed administratively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the disruption to our concreting sand and granite supplies, arising from the Indonesian ban on sand exports in 2007, reminds us of the importance to ensure the resilience of our materials supply.&nbsp; Through the licensing scheme, BCA will work with the materials importers to develop robust business continuity plans to guard against unforeseen supply disruptions.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have consulted the industry stakeholders on the proposed licensing scheme, and their feedback has been&nbsp;incorporated into the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me elaborate on the key amendments proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3423<p><p><I>New Part VIA on supply of essential construction materials</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 4 of the Bill will add a new Part VIA, to enable the implementation of a licensing scheme for importers of essential construction materials.&nbsp; For a start, the scheme will apply to the import of concreting sand and granite to be used for building work, street work or railway work in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Existing importers will be given&nbsp;six months to apply for a licence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The licence will be valid for not more than 24 months and is renewable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Quality tests</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licensees must also apply for an import permit for each consignment of materials.&nbsp; Test requirements to determine the chemical properties of imported materials, to ensure that they satisfy quality standards, will form part of the import permit conditions.&nbsp; The tests will have to be conducted by an authorised analyst designated by BCA, similar to the practice today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;briefly explain what constitutes \"quality\" sand and granite.&nbsp; Both these materials contain a certain amount of silica.&nbsp; To be of acceptable quality, these materials must not contain more than a specified level of reactive silica.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a high level of reactive silica is present in sand and granite, this silica will interact with the alkali present in cement, causing an \"alkali-silica reaction\". This reaction, occurring over a period of time in the concrete, will cause the concrete to expand and form widespread cracks.&nbsp; Over time, the steel bars within the concrete would become susceptible to rust and corrode in our humid climate, causing structural weakness of buildings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Business continuity plan</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The importer will also need to furnish a business continuity plan to demonstrate</p><p align=left>Column: 3424<p><p>the ability to mitigate any supply disruption of materials.&nbsp; BCA will evaluate the plan and issue a licence to the importers after it has been endorsed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the current economic conditions, we will allow a lead-time of at least 18 months for the industry to comply with this requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Penalty for importing without a licence</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The penalty for importing the stipulated construction materials without a valid licence is a fine not exceeding $500,000, or imprisonment not exceeding&nbsp;two years, or both.&nbsp; The severe penalty is necessary to serve as a strong deterrent, given that an unlicensed importer bringing in poor quality materials could endanger public safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Revocation of licence</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For licensees who fail to comply with the licence conditions, the Bill will allow BCA to impose a range of actions including suspending the licence, and imposing a financial penalty or such other directions or restrictions on the licensee&rsquo;s business as importer of such materials.&nbsp; The Bill also sets out the circumstances under which BCA can revoke an importer&rsquo;s licence.&nbsp; The Bill will nonetheless provide the importer with recourse to appeal to the Minister before a licence is revoked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have also taken the opportunity to make other amendments to improve some of the existing provisions in the Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will highlight the more salient ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to sections 9 and 12(1)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendments will be made to section 9 to empower the Minister to assign new functions and duties to BCA by assignment in writing, in line with the</p><p align=left>Column: 3425<p><p>overall mandate given to BCA under the Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 12(1) will be revised to clarify BCA&rsquo;s delegation powers.&nbsp; The revisions will make it clear that while BCA has the power to delegate its functions, duties or powers to its members, officers or committees of persons, BCA cannot delegate this \"power of delegation\" given to BCA under this section, nor can BCA delegate the power to make subsidiary legislation given under this Act or any other written law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>New sections 34A to 34E</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate the enforcement of the new Part VIA, sections 34A to 34E have been inserted.&nbsp; They deal with various miscellaneous matters such as composition of offences and obstruction to officers enforcing the Act.&nbsp; For example, section 34B has a standard provision to deal with corporate offenders and the officers or managers of such offenders.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill will enable a proper system to be put in place to ensure that imported construction materials meet the necessary quality standards, so that the structural integrity and safety of our buildings will not be compromised.&nbsp; It will also help to strengthen the resilience of our supply of essential construction materials.&nbsp; And it will formally authorise BCA to implement and enforce these important requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is the third time I am coming to the House to seek Members' support to amend the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA).&nbsp; I am grateful to Members for your strong support for the previous amendments.&nbsp; As a result, we have been able to save the lives of more patients with organ failure who would otherwise die prematurely or live in misery.&nbsp; Prior to the first round of amendments in 2004, there were, on average, 13 cadaveric kidney transplants in Singapore under HOTA each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is about one a month.&nbsp; Now, we are doing an average of 41 such transplants a year, more than three times as many.&nbsp; This is almost one every week.&nbsp; The two rounds of amendments have helped save many more lives.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am now ready to seek Members' support for the third round of HOTA amendments.&nbsp; There remains a shortage of organs.&nbsp; Last year, 26 patients died while waiting for an organ; currently, more than 560 patients remain waiting.&nbsp; We must continue to try to raise both&nbsp;cadaveric as well as&nbsp;living donor transplant rates.&nbsp; And we intend to do this by making the following changes to the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Proposed amendments</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we propose to remove the upper age limit for cadaveric organ donation </p><p align=left>Column: 3427<p><p>under HOTA.&nbsp; This will increase the number of cadaveric donors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we propose to allow paired matching for the exchange of organs between living donor-recipient pairs.&nbsp; This will facilitate living donor transplants.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we propose to remove the prohibition of payment to reimburse or defray the costs or expenses of living organ donors.&nbsp; This will better protect their welfare and ensure that they do not suffer from additional losses because of their altruistic acts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we propose to raise the penalties on middlemen and syndicates that engage in organ trading.&nbsp; This will help to deter organ trading.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now go into the details of the amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Remove upper age limit&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Currently, organs from deceased persons who were over 60 years of age at the time of death are not removed for transplant under HOTA even though their organs may be medically suitable for transplant.&nbsp; The limit of 60 years was set many years ago as a proxy indicator of a person's health in relation to his suitability as a donor.&nbsp; In practice, however, whether an organ can be used for transplant depends on&nbsp;the organ's&nbsp;condition, not the age of the donor.&nbsp; Clause 2 of the Bill will remove the age limit of 60 years for cadaveric organ donation under HOTA.&nbsp; As it is with all transplants today, before any organ is removed, a transplant doctor will assess the organ's condition to ensure that it is suitable for transplantation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We estimate that the removal of the age limit could increase the number of cadaveric organ donors by 10 to 12 each year&nbsp;&ndash; about one a month.&nbsp; This would potentially save and benefit 70 more patients a year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3428<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Bill is passed, we will carry out intensive public education to inform persons over 60 of how they will be affected.&nbsp; They will be given time to decide whether or not to opt-out of HOTA.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill clarifies in clause 6 that those who have already opted out of HOTA before this amendment will continue to be excluded even when they turn 60, unless they have withdrawn their objections.&nbsp; In parallel, we will also remove the upper age limit of 60 years for patients to be placed on the transplant waiting list.&nbsp; This will allow more elderly patients to benefit from organ transplant, which I think is a fair arrangement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Allow paired matching</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, clause 3 of the Bill will allow \"paired matching\".&nbsp; This is a way of matching living donors with compatible recipients across two or more medically incompatible donor-recipient pairs.&nbsp; The recipients essentially exchange donors so that each recipient can receive a medically suitable organ.&nbsp; Currently, HOTA does not explicitly allow this.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have had patients with relatives who were willing to donate their organs, but who were found to be medically incompatible.&nbsp; These patients thus had to be placed on the cadaveric organ waiting list for a suitable donor.&nbsp; With \"paired matching\", arrangements could be made for the relative of a patient to donate his organ to another medically compatible patient in return for that patient's relative to donate an organ to the first patient.&nbsp; This way, more patients can be matched with a suitable living organ donor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such \"pair-matched donations\" already take place overseas, such as in the US and UK.&nbsp; The Johns Hopkins Hospital was particularly successful, having transplanted over 50 patients involving more than 20 exchanges since its paired kidney exchange programme </p><p align=left>Column: 3429<p><p>started in 2001.&nbsp; It also performed the world's first&nbsp;three-way swap,&nbsp;that means three pairs, bringing six willing donors and recipients together for simultaneous operations in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, two lives were saved in Hong Kong's first paired exchange liver transplant where the wife of a patient and the sister-in-law of another patient cross-donated part of their livers.&nbsp; With our small population, the number of donor-recipient pairs that can be successfully matched may not be large, but such exchanges should be allowed wherever possible.&nbsp; To facilitate matching, we will set up a living donor registry.</p><p><br><I>Allow payment for living donors</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, HOTA prohibits all forms of payment to organ donors, including the reimbursement for the costs and expenses that they incur.&nbsp; For example, any reimbursement of lost income or medical expenses incurred by the donor is illegal.&nbsp; This position is really outdated and is unfair to the donors.&nbsp; It is not in line with accepted ethical practice in other countries.&nbsp; Many countries have already updated their legislations to provide for such reimbursements.&nbsp; For instance, US law permits reasonable payments associated with the medical costs, and other expenses of travel, housing, and lost wages incurred by the donor due to the donation.&nbsp; In UK, payments to defray or reimburse any expenses or loss of earnings incurred by a living organ donor so far as reasonably and directly attributable to his donation are allowed.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 3 and 5 of the Bill will amend the Act to permit the comprehensive reimbursement of costs and expenses&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;such as for short- or long-term medical care or insurance protection&nbsp;&ndash; and loss of earnings, which may be reasonably incurred by living organ donors as a result of their donation.</p><p align=left>Column: 3430<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment does not condone organ trading or legalise it.&nbsp; It seeks merely to allow some patients who wish to defray or reimburse the costs or expenses which their donors may incur, to ensure that these donors do not suffer financially as a result of their altruistic acts.&nbsp; This is based on the ethical principles of equity and fairness, which demand that we protect not just the welfare of the recipients, but also that of the donors.&nbsp; Our proposed amendment does not mandate, but merely allows, some reasonable payments to be made to the donors, insofar as they do not constitute an inducement to the donor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Increase penalty for syndicated organ trading</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, clause 3 of the Bill increases the penalty for syndicated organ trading.&nbsp; The current penalty in HOTA for organ trading does not distinguish between the buyer, the seller and the middleman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In syndicated organ trading, both the buyer and the seller are exploited by the middleman, who often creams off a significant portion of the transacted amount.&nbsp; We all sympathise with the plight of patients suffering from organ failure, as well as those who may be driven by desperation to sell their organs in order to make ends meet.&nbsp; Within the existing framework that criminalises organ trading, we propose a specific, aggravated offence for middlemen and syndicates who engage in organ trading, with an increased maximum penalty of a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or both.&nbsp; This is a ten-fold increase from the current maximum penalty and will serve as a greater deterrence for these middlemen and syndicates and protect the vulnerable from being exploited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Public consultation</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These proposed amendments were extensively discussed over several months</p> <p align=left>Column: 3431<p><p>last year, among the public,&nbsp;the medical and the professional organisations.&nbsp; A formal public consultation based on the text of a draft Bill was further organised during the last few months of the year.&nbsp; We received strong support for all the proposed amendments.&nbsp; There were two concerns with regard to payment for living organ donors.</p><p><br><I>Use of the term \"compensation\"</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, there was concern over the use of the term \"compensation\".&nbsp; We use that term in the original draft Bill.&nbsp; Some Singaporeans felt that it might be misconstrued as the legalisation of organ trading.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have thus removed the term \"compensation\" and instead used the words \"defraying\" and \"reimbursing\" to refer to the payment to cover the costs or expenses that a donor incurs as a result of his donation.&nbsp; Hospital transplant ethics committees will continue to screen living donor transplants to weed out organ trading.&nbsp; In addition, clause 5 of the Bill allows us to make subsidiary legislation, if necessary, to regulate and administer reimbursement and the payment process, as an added safeguard against organ trading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Applicability of the law on payment to foreign donors</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, some suggested that foreign donors should not be paid, as what is a reasonable quantum in Singapore may end up inducing the poor in the region to sell their organs.&nbsp; We appreciate the underlying concerns and we certainly do not intend Singapore to become a regional organ trading hub.&nbsp; But we cannot address these concerns by enacting a law that unfairly discriminates against organ donors based on their nationality.&nbsp; The principle underlying this amendment is one of fairness to donors.&nbsp; We achieve this by </p><p align=left>Column: 3432<p><p>allowing donors to be comprehensively reimbursed for costs, expenses and lost earnings that they incur.&nbsp; It would be patently unfair if a donor in Singapore who is a citizen can be reimbursed, but a donor in Singapore who happens to be of a different nationality cannot.&nbsp; Instead, we will continue to rely on the hospital transplant ethics committees, and our law, to prevent organ trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Lifting the Whip</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as with past amendments to HOTA, I have asked that the Whip be lifted to allow Members to debate and vote on the Bill based on their religious and ethical beliefs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the House supports this Bill, my Ministry will continue with its efforts to increase the awareness among Singaporeans of these amendments and their implications.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, today, many Singaporeans continue to suffer as a result of the shortage of organs for transplant.&nbsp; We must try all reasonable means to maximise our yield of cadaveric donors and to promote altruistic living donor organ transplants.&nbsp; Our proposed amendments will not eliminate the shortage of organs, but they will help to save more lives and reduce suffering.&nbsp; I hope this House will join me in this mission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.40 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the present Bill proposes three amendments to increase the number of organs available for transplants.&nbsp; The first two on removing the upper age limit for cadaveric organ donations and</p> <p align=left>Column: 3433<p><p>allowing paired matching of organs are pretty straightforward.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experience of Spain, which has a short waiting list for kidney transplants, is useful as a third of the cadaveric kidneys are from people over 60 years old. &nbsp;Likewise, paired matching is not new and will help to increase the number of living donors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two changes are welcomed.&nbsp; I also strongly support the increase in penalties for those who are engaged in organ trading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third amendment, however, which allows payment for living donors, has raised some concerns as it can be viewed as a modification of the hitherto accepted principle of altruism in organ donation. &nbsp;In fact, in my humble opinion, Sir, it would have been better if the three amendments were done in two stages.&nbsp; We could have first proceeded with the two amendments, which remove the upper age limit for cadaveric organ donations and allow paired matching. &nbsp;This would give us time to assess the effectiveness of the changes in reducing the waiting time for patients before proceeding to the more controversial amendment, which allows for payment to the donors.&nbsp; We could then study in greater depth the experience of countries like Spain and Norway, which have very successful living donor programmes and short waiting lists.&nbsp; If we fail, then we are clearly in a much stronger position to change the basis for HOTA and allow payment for organ donations. &nbsp;Notwithstanding this, although the amendment covers all three situations, I believe that the implementation could still be in stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Ministry of Health consider this proposal.&nbsp; This would give the Ministry more time to examine in greater depths some of the issues raised in relation to payment to</p><p align=left>Column: 3434<p><p>living donors.&nbsp; Sir, as I see it, the amendment to allow for reimbursement or payment for living donors is meant to tread the middle path.&nbsp; On the one hand, we have the current situation where there is absolutely no ability for any payment whatsoever to be made.&nbsp; On the other hand, we have the extreme situation where there is organ trading which is highly deplorable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that under the WHO Guidelines, Guiding Principle 5, certain reimbursements are allowed, for example, costs of recovery from operation and loss of income. &nbsp;Minister Khaw, too, has stressed that this amendment does not condone or legalise organ trading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have a number of issues to raise with regard to the proposal to pay living donors.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real challenge, in my view, will lie in the implementation. &nbsp;Although the intent of the law is clear in practice, once payment is involved, it will be very difficult to say which donors are motivated by only altruistic reasons, especially when foreign donors from poorer countries with no relationship whatsoever with the recipients are involved. This is the crux of the issue: when is a payment only a reimbursement of expenses and lost wages and when does it become an inducement, which is prohibited under HOTA, especially when it involves living non-related donors?&nbsp;&nbsp;At what point would a transaction involving an exchange of money become organ trading?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, other questions also arise.&nbsp; One of it is&nbsp;how is the price to be set?&nbsp; What is reasonable compensation? &nbsp;If the amount is too low then it will be unfair to the donors, which then defeats the purpose for this amendment.&nbsp; But if it is too high, then it will no longer be a reimbursement but becomes an inducement. &nbsp;Another question would be: how do we assess </p><p align=left>Column: 3435<p><p>loss of earnings?&nbsp; Would a person who is unemployed receive much less than someone who is working and would a high-income earner receive more than a low-income earner? &nbsp;Is it fair to make these distinctions since it is the unemployed and low-income earner who is more likely to donate compared to the high-income earner?&nbsp; In fact, this is the experience in the Philippines.&nbsp; Most of the donors are unemployed or they&nbsp;do jobs</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>that earn very low income.&nbsp; And what about foreigners? Should they be paid the same amount as Singaporeans?&nbsp; If so, would it not be an inducement especially if they are from poorer countries because of the income disparity among countries?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this context, I would like to ask the Minister to share more details with this House on how the&nbsp;Ministry intends to regulate and administer the reimbursement and payment process.&nbsp; I hope that these details would add greater clarity and depth to this debate and address concerns over whether allowing reimbursements could lead to organ trading.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another major concern now that reimbursements are allowed is the issue of equitable allocation of kidneys. &nbsp;If in the past, criteria could include factors like age, health condition or likely benefit from the transplant, without regard to a person&rsquo;s financial situation, what is the criteria today?&nbsp; Could a recipient who is low in priority now be able to jump the queue because he or she can afford to pay the reimbursement?&nbsp; This is an important point and I hope that the Minister could elaborate whether there will be any impact on the equitable allocation of kidneys and how the Ministry&nbsp;intends to assist poorer patients who cannot afford to pay so that they do not end up seriously disadvantaged.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, organ transplants involving living donors carry certain risks for the donors.&nbsp; Where living related organ donors are concerned, this would not be a major issue as love, care and concern arising </p>  <p align=left>Column: 3436<p>  <p>from strong family ties would be&nbsp;key considerations.&nbsp; But when living non-related organ donors are concerned,&nbsp;especially now that there will be payment, it is important to have in place a proper system to educate would-be donors on what is involved in donating one of their kidneys so that they can give&nbsp;informed consent.&nbsp; Kidney donors need to undergo proper health and psychological counselling.&nbsp; For&nbsp;example, they need to know that with only one kidney, if that kidney fails to function, they may end up having to receive dialysis or kidney transplants themselves!&nbsp; They need to know whether it would impact&nbsp; their ability to work and they need to have regular post operative medical check-ups. &nbsp;In a survey which was conducted recently among 311 living non-related kidney donors in the Philippines, about 25% reported that their health deteriorated after the surgery and 40% felt that their economic status worsened or did not change after they donated their kidneys.&nbsp; So, I would like to ask the&nbsp;Ministry of Health&nbsp;to&nbsp;look into this.&nbsp;<I>&nbsp;</I>I would also like to suggest that the Ministry creates a database of all living donors to ensure that there is a proper checking and follow up on their welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the biggest gaps found in many countries, including the Philippines, is this lack of effort to provide for the needs of donors, particularly in medical care after the transplant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to suggest that instead of paying everything in cash, the Ministry could require that part of the payment go&nbsp;into the Medisave account of the organ donors, which they can then use to pay for their medical insurance or any hospitalisation cost in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other points which I hope the Ministry would&nbsp;address is the question on whether allowing payment for living organ donations would affect altruistic organ donations, including cadaveric donations.&nbsp; Would people now feel that they are less</p><p align=left>Column: 3437<p><p>compelled to donate their bodies or&nbsp;donate their organs after their&nbsp;death?&nbsp; Would they opt&nbsp;out?&nbsp; Would this also make even living organ donors, who are related to the patient, also feel that if there is payment to be made there is no need for them to donate to their loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a need to strengthen the hospital ethics committees as we now have enhanced roles having to assess whether or not there is inducement when a living non-related donor appears before them.&nbsp; I am not quite sure whether they are equipped for the role and the Ministry may want to consider whether it wants to follow the Philippines' model of appointing a separate committee to perform this task.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, Sir,&nbsp;subject to proper regulations and safeguards on the points which I have raised earlier, and so long as it is in line with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, reimbursements for organ donations among Singaporeans is still acceptable as the element of inducement and exploitation would,&nbsp; in my view, be much less and, thus, more manageable.&nbsp; Even on this,&nbsp;the Ministry may want to be pre-emptive and consider disallowing Singaporean living organ donors, who are not related to the foreign patients, from donating their kidneys.&nbsp; This is the situation in some countries to prevent the exploitation of their own citizens by foreigners.&nbsp; Although the odds of this happening in Singapore is quite low because of the level of our development and the standard of our education, one can never tell what may happen in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My biggest concern, Sir,&nbsp;is over allowing payment to foreign organ donors.&nbsp; The Minister had said that we should not discriminate against foreign organ donors.&nbsp; According to him, it would be unfair if a donor in Singapore who is a citizen can be</p> <p align=left>Column: 3438<p><p>reimbursed but a donor in Singapore who happens to be of a different nationality cannot.&nbsp; Whilst we want to ensure fair treatment between local and foreign donors, there are other more compelling reasons why we should seriously reconsider whether it is wise to extend payment to living non-related foreign donors.&nbsp; A&nbsp;key concern would be whether this would lead to an influx of poor donors from developing countries, brought in by unscrupulous middlemen, and whether this would tarnish our reputation as a medical hub.&nbsp; Would we end up as a major transplant centre where rich patients can take advantage of cheaper transplants with organs secured from poor living unrelated foreign donors?&nbsp; Surely this is not the kind of distinction that we want for ourselves.&nbsp; Even the Philippines&nbsp;&ndash; which has had a reimbursement scheme similar to the one that we now want to introduce and has&nbsp;two non-profit institutions handling such transplants, namely, the Kidney Foundation of the Philippines and the Philippines Organ Donation Programme, which is a government body&nbsp;&ndash; has not been able to stop the black market and exploitation of the poor.&nbsp; A review of the Iranian system in the British Medical Journal also shows that even with legalisation of organ trading, Iran has not been able to correct the problem of the black market for organs and the exploitation of the poor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, because of the severity of the problem, in June 2008, the Philippine government banned foreigners from getting organ transplants in the Philippines.&nbsp; India, too, has plans to tighten its organ transplant laws and put more curbs on foreigners who come for such operations.&nbsp; The Philippine government&rsquo;s concerns are valid.&nbsp; In 2007, just over half the 1,046 kidney transplants in the Philippines were for foreigners despite a 10% foreign recipient rule in each hospital. &nbsp;Some hospitals were doing as many as 90% of their transplants on foreign patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3439<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, there are really serious concerns when we open the doors so wide to allow compensation for foreign living unrelated organ donors.&nbsp; Could I ask the Minister, how would this affect our relationship and solidarity with other countries, particularly those from the ASEAN region?&nbsp; How would the Philippine government, for instance, view our efforts to allow their nationals to donate their kidneys in Singapore for a reimbursement to non-Filipino foreign patients when such transplant operations are illegal in their own country?&nbsp; Would this create friction among ASEAN countries?&nbsp; Would we be seen as condoning or encouraging&nbsp; their citizens to break their law?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister on WHO&rsquo;s&nbsp;reaction to our proposal and whether they have expressed any concerns about the potential for such cross border transplants to promote trafficking in human organs? &nbsp;If the WHO had expressed reservations, then I would like to ask the Minister how do we intend to address this and whether it would affect our efforts to promote Singapore as a medical hub?&nbsp; Would we be seen as exploitative and would this affect our reputation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the other reason&nbsp;I am very concerned about this proposal to reimburse living non-related foreign organ donors is&nbsp;we have a huge presence of foreign workers in Singapore.&nbsp; Many are now affected by the global economic downturn.&nbsp; There are unscrupulous agents who have brought in such workers but have no jobs for them or want to send them back after only a few months.&nbsp; Foreign workers had to pay their agents thousands of dollars before coming to Singapore. &nbsp;Because of poor business, many foreign workers are also affected because they used to depend on overtime, which is now very much reduced because of economic situation. &nbsp;I am afraid, Sir, that if these foreign workers cannot earn</p><p align=left>Column: 3440<p><p>enough to pay off their debts, they will become a ready, vulnerable pool of organ donors to be exploited and abused.&nbsp; And this will really be bad for Singapore.&nbsp; For the reasons that I have mentioned earlier, I am not convinced that we can completely eradicate the problem of the middlemen.&nbsp; The same unscrupulous agents that have brought in these workers could now become their middlemen because it is not possible to stop under the table payments as organs can now be allocated based on who can pay.&nbsp; If someone is prepared to pay more than what is recommended by some government appointed agency, then I am certain they will find a lot more donors.&nbsp; Desperate, vulnerable and badly in need of money, many of these foreign workers will be pressurised to become donors.&nbsp; To a desperate foreign worker, even a reimbursement of $10,000 would be attractive compared to going home empty handed with a huge debt waiting for him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I truly hope to hear the Minister's comments and responses to these issues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, I struggled quite a bit in deciding whether or not to support these amendments because I feel that there are serious ethical issues, particularly&nbsp;involving payment to foreign organ donors. But as I studied the amendments, they are neutral as there is no specific mention of the donors&rsquo; nationality. And&nbsp; I do believe that subject to safeguards and the various&nbsp;clarifications that I have sought and also so long as it is consistent with the WHO guidelines, reimbursing Singaporean organ donors for costs incurred, such as medical costs and income losses is acceptable.&nbsp; And as a whole, the amendments would make available more&nbsp;kidneys and organs&nbsp;for transplants, which is good for Singaporeans.&nbsp; But I do hope that in its implementation, the Minister would seriously reconsider the idea of paying foreign organ donors because there are many pitfalls and there is really no need</p><p align=left>Column: 3441<p><p>for us to be the trail-blazer in this especially when the potential for abuse is great.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Human Organ Transplant amendment Bill.&nbsp;<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The organ trading debacle last year has raised many eyebrows and mixed reactions from Singaporeans.&nbsp; Organ trading or organ sale is a highly controversial subject, with Singaporeans clearly divided on the issue.&nbsp; The one good outcome that arose from the hype and debate of this issue last year was the enhanced awareness of the plights of many organ failure sufferers and the controversies related to illegal organ trading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organ failure can affect any organ in the body, such the kidney, liver, heart, lungs and cornea.&nbsp; Organ failure can also affect anyone in Singapore.&nbsp; Whilst dialysis can help to prolong and sustain lives in patients with end-stage kidney failure, sufferers of liver, heart and lungs failure often die before a suitable cadaveric donor can be found.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, there are currently about 560 patients on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.&nbsp; The wait is long, averaging an arduous nine years, and often futile for many, dropping out of the list from either death or becoming too ill to eligible for one.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The main controversy in organ trading stems around the ethical concerns, for fear that the poor and ignorant donors may be exploited by the rich recipients, and that those who can afford to pay will step out of the queue sooner to get a transplant.&nbsp; The opponents of organ</p><p align=left>Column: 3442<p><p>trading frown upon the idea of even putting a price tag on any human organ.&nbsp; Some found the thought of selling one's organ demeaning and repulsive.&nbsp; They argued that organ trading can potentially divide people into \"worthy patients\" and \"worthless sellers\".&nbsp; Ethics aside, many religions also do not condone the sale of human organs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary, proponents of legalising organ trading argue that if there were willing buyers and willing sellers, why not?&nbsp; If the availability of an organ could save a life, who are we to judge and nail the death sentence on the sick, when the transplant operation could well be the gift of a new life?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the current state of affair is less than ideal.&nbsp; The current HOTA makes the payment of any kind illegal and this has inevitably pushed desperate patients into seeking quick and often reckless solutions from the black market.&nbsp; It will be&nbsp;naive of us to believe that all is well and that legalising organ trading will only result in the poor being exploited.&nbsp; The near-global ban on organ trading has forced the practice underground, with little control over the standard of medical care and the welfare of the poor organ sellers.&nbsp; The very fact that the black market exists to serve the high demand from patients all over the world already&nbsp;result in possible and unreported ignorant donors being exploited by the buyers and their middlemen, since there is currently no law to ensure a fair, un-coerced deal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the terms \"Organ Trading\", \"Organ Sale\" or \"Compensation\" exuberate very negative connotations.&nbsp;&nbsp;A better and more appropriate term, as proposed by the Minister, after public consultation, will be&nbsp;\"reimbursement\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many have argued that allowing reimbursement of organ donors will result in the significant shrinking&nbsp;of the number of &nbsp;altruistic \"live\" donations.&nbsp;Whilst the</p><p align=left>Column: 3443<p><p>number of altruistic unrelated \"live\" donations may drop, the proportion of unrelated \"live\" donations is indeed minuscule in the first place.&nbsp; Altruistic related \"live\" donation, however, is unlikely to experience significant decline as majority, if not all, of such donations were done out of love and care for the related recipients.&nbsp; And I sincerely believe no amount of monetary enticement will deter or change the minds of these altruistic donors in giving a new lease of life to their loved ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sole objective of reimbursement would be to compensate the donors for the sufferings and inconveniences experienced as a result of the organ donation.&nbsp; There is no doubt that the donor suffers the pain and discomfort of the surgical procedure and the recuperation period can last up to a few months.&nbsp; This period of downtime will render the donor economically inactive with consequential loss of potential income.&nbsp; This could only serve as a disincentive for a willing altruistic \"live\" donor to step forward.&nbsp; The all-important question of how this can be done fairly and ethically will warrant a comprehensive and robust study by all stakeholders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount to be reimbursed should ideally be fair, yet not large enough to become an inducement.&nbsp; The mode of reimbursement also needs to be worked out.&nbsp; There have been suggestions of paying a monthly allowance or setting up a fund for the donor's family.&nbsp; Others have also suggested putting the amount into a CPF account or using it to pay for the donor's medical insurance in the long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One plausible proposal would be to have a neutral third party to administer the reimbursement for organ donation.&nbsp; This would prevent the direct negotiation between the donor and the recipient, which can sometimes make the whole process look so commercial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3444<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, sufficient safeguards must be put in place to ensure that there is no coercion or enticement into donating, and that the donor is adequately counselled on the decision.&nbsp; In Iran, the \"sharing of organs\",&nbsp;as they have coined it, is controlled by the Charity Association for the support of Kidney Patients (CASKP) and the Charity Foundation for Special Diseases (CFSD), with the support of the Iranian government.&nbsp; Whilst the current system in Iran may not be perfect, it is definitely worth a look and the important lessons learnt can be useful during the formulation of our system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shortage of donor organs is a worldwide phenomenon.&nbsp; It is estimated that there are 40,000 patients waiting for a kidney in Western Europe, 6,000 in United Kingdom and about 70,000 in the United States.&nbsp; Against a backdrop of this critical shortage in supply of organs, the cost of&nbsp;organs in the black market has escalated significantly.&nbsp; The rising cost of human organs is driving syndicates to resort to even murder to harvest human organs.&nbsp; The organ transplant market has become so lucrative and is also the driving force behind the transplant tourism in certain countries.&nbsp; There is, therefore, an urgent need for Governments to take bold steps to regulate and prevent exploitation of the vulnerable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the passing of this Bill, Singapore is likely to be one of the leaders in formulating reimbursement for \"live\" organ donation.&nbsp; It is, therefore, imperative for the Government to guard against, wittingly or not, from promoting transplant tourism.&nbsp; After it was reported in some websites our intent to liberalise and sanction the reimbursement for organ donation, there have been several postings from India, Pakistan and Bali, asking for information on how they could donate their kidneys for a price.&nbsp; This is the image that we do not intend to portray to the rest of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3445<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to seek clarification from the Minister if the reimbursement is restricted only to Singaporeans and how would foreign donors and recipients, ie,&nbsp;a foreign donor donating to another foreign recipient, be managed should the transplant procedure be performed in Singapore? Would the donor be reimbursed, and if so, who will pay for the amount reimbursed?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's current opt-out system of cadaveric organ donation is one significant step in improving the supply of organs.&nbsp; In order to further tackle the shortages, immediate steps must be taken to improve on the current number of cadaveric and altruistic \"live\" organ donations.&nbsp; There are several limitations in the current HOTA and I am glad that the Ministry of Health will be introducing two new initiatives to boost the organ supply in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current HOTA forbids the harvesting of organs in consented deceased above the age of 60.&nbsp; This has led to unnecessary wastage of potentially healthy organs.&nbsp; Many countries, including Spain which has one of the world's highest transplant rates, do not set such upper age limit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lifting the arbitrary age limit of 60 for cadaveric organ donors would definitely increase the pool of potential cadaveric donors.&nbsp; There is currently no scientific basis to the viability of the donated organ based on its age.&nbsp; The decision on the suitability and viability should lie on the transplant specialist, who should decide based on the medical history of the donor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second initiative would be the setting up of a \"live\" donor registry where matching of a donor whose tissue is incompatible with the intended recipient with another pair in a similar situation.&nbsp; These paired matching donations would</p> <p align=left>Column: 3446<p><p>hopefully minimise the situation whereby altruistic donors are turned away because of incompatibility with the intended recipient and thus boost the number of altruistic \"live\" donations in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the increasing prevalence of chronic systemic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus in Singapore, the number of patients suffering from organ failure is expected to increase further.&nbsp; Whilst the amended Bill will serve to increase the supply of both cadaveric organs and altruistic \"live\" organs, it is imperative to target the underlying factors contributing to the causation of organ failures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The loan is a three-year loan, to be drawn down over one year and repaid in entirety at the three-year mark.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The loan was made conditional on Micron investing in TECH an amount that is significantly larger than the loan quantum and Micron providing leading edge technology to upgrade TECH. The new technology will help TECH maintain its position as one of the most cost-efficient memory chip plants in the world. Micron&rsquo;s investment will also generate significant economic spin-offs to the rest of the semiconductor industry in Singapore, and to other supporting industries such as semiconductor equipment and chemicals.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The loan to Micron is backed by collateral that is worth much more than the loan. The risk of diminution in collateral value through action by Micron or TECH has been mitigated through appropriate financial covenants in the loan terms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Micron loan was made under EDB&rsquo;s existing scheme for targeted investment promotion, and was hence not disbursed through a bank.&nbsp; This loan is not a financial <p align=left>Column: 3449<p>assistance measure for the economic downturn nor should it be compared to the Government&rsquo;s risk-sharing facilities for loans made to local companies through the banking system under the Special Risk-sharing Initiative, or SRI.&nbsp; The SRI facilities are temporary and intended to facilitate the flow of credit to deserving companies facing a credit crunch in the current economic climate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investment promotion loans made by EDB, such as the Micron loan, are different: they are made under a standing scheme and subject to having in place satisfactory guarantee and collateral, rigorous cost-benefit analysis, and conditions designed to maximise economic benefits to Singapore.&nbsp; EDB&rsquo;s use of a variety of tools for investment promotion has been instrumental in helping to anchor a range of manufacturing and services industries which have provided good jobs for Singaporeans over the years.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

and (c) what are the estimated refund amounts at ages 75 and 80 under the LIFE Balanced, LIFE Plus and LIFE Basic Plans.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recommended by the National Longevity Insurance Committee (NLIC), CPF LIFE will be administered by the CPF Board.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew asked about the adequacy of the CPF LIFE monthly payouts.&nbsp; CPF LIFE is intended to provide members with a monthly income from age 65, for as long as they live.&nbsp; The level of monthly income will depend on the amount of savings members have in their CPF Retirement Account, as well as interest rates.&nbsp; The more savings the member has and the higher the interest rates, the higher the payout will be.&nbsp; This is fair to members, and will also ensure that CPF LIFE remains self-funded and sustainable.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although actual interest rates for the Retirement Account and CPF LIFE will move with the market, members should be assured that these will not fall below the guaranteed floor of 3.5% on the first $60,000 of CPF balances and 2.5% for amounts above that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have introduced several measures to help members accumulate more CPF savings.&nbsp; First, we have given an extra 1% interest on the first $60,000 of members&rsquo; CPF balances since January 2008.&nbsp; Next, we have introduced various bonuses, namely, the D-, V- and L-Bonuses.&nbsp; To recap, the D-Bonus is given to members whose Minimum Sum Draw-Down Age has been deferred beyond age 62.&nbsp; The V-Bonus is given to members who voluntarily defer their Draw-Down Age or purchase annuities.&nbsp; The L-Bonus is given to eligible members who participate in CPF LIFE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me illustrate the impact of these measures using an example.&nbsp; Mr Lim is 59 years old this year and opts in to the <I>LIFE Balanced Plan</I> with $67,000 cash in his Retirement Account.&nbsp; Let&nbsp;us&nbsp;also assume he qualifies for the maximum L-Bonus of $4,000 and also receives the D-Bonus of $1,500.&nbsp; On top of this, he receives $1,200 in V-Bonus for<p align=left>Column: 3451<p> purchasing an annuity, in this case, a CPF LIFE plan.&nbsp; Without the 1% extra interest and the bonuses, his CPF LIFE monthly income would be $360-$390.&nbsp; With the 1% extra interest and the various bonuses, his monthly income could be up to $450-$480. This is about 25% more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also made it easier and more attractive for family members to top up their Retirement Accounts through the Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme.&nbsp; Givers will be eligible for tax relief for top-ups in cash.&nbsp; Top-ups, whether in cash or in CPF, will help the recipients participate in CPF LIFE, enjoy the 1% extra interest, the L-Bonus, and possibly higher D- and V-Bonuses.&nbsp; In addition, older low wage workers will receive additional CPF contributions from Workfare.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Mr Siew asked about the bequest amounts at different ages, under the various CPF LIFE plans.&nbsp; The bequest amount is the sum of the member&rsquo;s remaining CPF savings and the CPF LIFE premium less the monthly income received.&nbsp; It will therefore decrease as payouts are made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me illustrate with the example of a 55-year-old male member who joins CPF LIFE in 2013 with $67,000 cash in his Retirement Account.&nbsp; Under the <I>LIFE Balanced Plan</I>, if he passes away at the age of 75, his beneficiaries will receive a bequest amount of between $51,000 and $52,000.&nbsp; However, if he passes away at the age of 80, the bequest amount reduces to between $21,000 and $23,000, as he has received&nbsp;five additional years of LIFE income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the <I>LIFE Plus Plan</I>, the bequest amount will be between $1,000 and $8,000 at age 75, and reduces to $0 by age 80.&nbsp; For the <I>LIFE Basic Plan</I>, the bequest amount will be $72,000 to $77,000 at age 75, and $54,000 to $58,000 at age 80.&nbsp; These numbers are only estimates, as LIFE payouts are dependent on actual CPF balances, interest rates and mortality experience.&nbsp; Members who would like to find out more can contact the CPF Board.&nbsp; They may also use the <I>CPF LIFE Payout Estimator</I> on CPF Board&rsquo;s website.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 3451<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:UNDERGRADUATES ON SCHOLARSHIP--><!--END_COL_TITLE:UNDERGRADUATES ON SCHOLARSHIP:::3454--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Given the long working hours they spend on the road, they face more difficult driving conditions than most other drivers. The ability to deal with these challenges decreases as a person ages.&nbsp; For this reason, an age limit of 70 years was introduced for taxi vocational licence holders in the 1970s as a prudent safeguard to protect the well-being of taxi drivers, their passengers and other road users.&nbsp; The age limit was raised to 73 years in 2006. As for driving instructors, the maximum age limit is 70.&nbsp; This age limit ensures that they still possess the necessary skills and reflexes to control the vehicles driven by their students.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As for other driving licences, there is also an age limit for Class 4, 4A and 5 licences (these are for heavy vehicle and bus drivers), and this is set at 70 years. In fact, holders of these licences need to go for a medical check up and a proficiency test every year starting from the age of 65 all the way till 69.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is no age limit for motorcycle and motorcar licence holders at present, each licence holder needs to provide a medical report issued by a registered medical practitioner, certifying that he or she is physically and mentally fit to drive a motor vehicle once every three years, starting from the age of 65.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3455<p> It is not appropriate to compare the age limit imposed on taxi drivers with that of other driving licences as the circumstances faced by taxi drivers are more onerous than those of other licence holders.&nbsp; Furthermore, even though elderly taxi drivers are currently tested on their physical attributes, such as visual, cognitive and driving abilities, the tests do not replicate the actual working conditions that taxi drivers face, such as extended hours of driving, and the higher susceptibility to fatigue due to age.&nbsp; Hence, the testing regime does not obviate the need for an age limit as another safeguard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For safety reasons, the Land Transport Authority has adopted a conservative approach in extending the age limit of taxi drivers from 70 to 73 in 2006, and will continually review whether further adjustments are possible.&nbsp; Ultimately, we have to ensure that the interests and safety of taxi drivers, as well as their passengers and other road users, are adequately safeguarded.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

and (b) what is the progress of the work of the High Level Panel.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Siew Kum Hong for his interest in the ASEAN human rights body.&nbsp; This is an important subject.&nbsp; Let me emphasise that Singapore is firmly committed to the establishment of an ASEAN human rights body.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The High Level Panel (HLP) that is drafting the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the proposed ASEAN human rights body has completed a first draft of the TOR.&nbsp; This was presented to the ASEAN Foreign Ministers for comments at the sidelines of the 14th ASEAN Summit in Cha-Am, Thailand, on 27th February 2009.&nbsp; The final Terms of Reference is expected to be endorsed by the ASEAN Foreign Ministers at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in July 2009.&nbsp; At Cha-Am, the Foreign Ministers also agreed that the ASEAN human rights body should be launched by the ASEAN Leaders at the 15th ASEAN Summit in Thailand in October 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet the deadline, the HLP will now have to reconcile and incorporate the Ministers&rsquo; comments into the TOR.&nbsp; This will not be straightforward as the comments by the Foreign Ministers reflected the diversity of ASEAN.&nbsp; This diversity is a political reality that cannot be wished away.&nbsp; Some ASEAN Member States preferred a body which is less intrusive because they believe that Western countries and NGOs might manipulate it to interfere in their domestic politics.&nbsp; Others made the opposite argument, that a robust and credible human rights body will help us address this issue on our own terms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not want to prejudge the HLP&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; But I am not pessimistic.&nbsp; Only a few years ago no one could have imagined that today ASEAN would be seriously considering establishing a human rights body.&nbsp; The initial positions among ASEAN Member States were so polarised that some of us then did not dare to believe that Article 14 of the ASEAN Charter on the establishment of an ASEAN human rights body was possible.&nbsp; That we are today agreed that ASEAN should create such a body is thus a major step forward.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3457<p> So even if the HLP is unable to move the TOR forward from where we were in February, we are already better off than before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Still, I hope the HLP will be able to improve the TOR.&nbsp; We will certainly try.&nbsp; But we should not forget that this is a very delicate negotiation where every word and every comma has been and will continue to be carefully scrutinized and debated before being agreed.&nbsp; The final document will be a political compromise.&nbsp; So it will not be a perfect document, but a document that reflects the current state of consensus on human rights in ASEAN at a particular time.&nbsp; But the TOR we adopt in July will not be the end of the story.&nbsp; We will continue to take the process forward, one step at a time.&nbsp; If we tried to agree on everything at the outset, we would have never even started; if one party or another tries too vigorously to shape the TOR in one direction or another, the whole process may well be derailed.&nbsp; We must approach this negotiation in the spirit of the physician&rsquo;s motto: \"First of all, do no harm\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore in dealing with this issue, ASEAN has adopted what we have called \"an evolutionary approach\".&nbsp; At each point we will have to agree on what will be the next step, without specifying what will be our final destination for this body.&nbsp; The pace will not always please all observers; it may not even please all ASEAN Member States.&nbsp; But we all recognise that this is not a static situation and that attitudes and policies towards human rights in ASEAN will continue to develop.&nbsp; The ASEAN human rights body will accordingly continue to evolve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The TOR for the ASEAN human rights body cannot, and is not intended to, exhaustively determine every single detail of ASEAN's approach to human rights in advance.&nbsp; Over time, the body will have to build up its own practices and positions in a way analogous to case law.&nbsp; Ultimately, the effectiveness of the ASEAN human rights body will depend, not just on the TOR but on our evolution as an ASEAN Community and our growing sense of a common destiny.&nbsp; We hope that year by year, as we become an ever closer community, the layers and best practices that we accumulate and hold in common as ASEAN will grow.&nbsp; The role and stature of the ASEAN human rights body will grow in tandem with this process.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As a general principle, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) will keep these facilities available when there is adequate demand.&nbsp; SSC will consider the option of closing facilities with very low utilisation despite efforts to promote usage, as they become too costly to maintain. For these closed facilities, SSC will explore leasing them out for alternative sports and recreation uses, or work with grassroots organisations to convert the facilities <p align=left>Column: 3459<p>for community use. In instances where no good alternative use can be found, SSC would return the premises to the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A total of&nbsp;eight swimming complexes have been closed because of low utilisation. Of these, SSC has successfully sub-leased&nbsp;two swimming complexes<sup>1</sup> to private organisations for sports related use.&nbsp; Two complexes<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;have been returned to SLA upon expiration of lease, so that the sites can be considered for other developments. This leaves&nbsp;four public swimming complexes<sup>3&nbsp;</sup> that have remained closed for more than&nbsp;five years, despite SSC&rsquo;s efforts to put them out for sports or other uses.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a final round of effort, SSC is currently actively engaging private organisations as well as the Citizens&rsquo; Consultative Committees (CCCs) and their Advisors, to explore alternative uses for the&nbsp;four closed swimming complexes.&nbsp; If there are no takers, the premises will be returned to SLA.</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB\"><font size=\"3\"><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\"><sup>1</sup></span> <font size=\"2\">Farrer Park&nbsp;and Boon Lay.</font></font></span></p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB\"><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\"><sup>2&nbsp;</sup></span> <font>River</font></span> <font><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB\">Valley</span>&nbsp;and <span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB\">Paya Lebar.</span></font></p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><font size=\"3\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB\"><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA\"><sup>3&nbsp;</sup></span> Yan Kit, Bukit Merah,</span> <font size=\"2\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB\">Jurong</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB\">Town&nbsp;and Pandan</span> <span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB\">Gardens.</span></font></font></p><BR></div></P></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 3459<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:PUBLIC SPORTS FACILITIES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:PUBLIC SPORTS FACILITIES:::3460--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>PUBLIC SPORTS FACILITIES</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Extension of opening hours--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Extension of opening hours)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Baey Yam Keng </B>asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports whether the positive outcome of the pilot run to extend the opening hours of Queenstown Stadium will be applied to other public sports facilities and, if so, how this will be applied.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Sports Council (SSC) stadiums are currently open from 4.30 am till 8.30 pm daily.

Since its introduction in 1997, the scheme has witnessed a steady growth in the number and diversity of performances. Busking activities have extended beyond singing, playing of musical instruments, balloon twisters and circus acts.&nbsp; We now see a wider range of acts that include magic shows, percussion groups, solo theatrical acts and craft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Busking activities should be carried out within a safe environment and in an orderly manner without creating disamenities to other users of public spaces.&nbsp; NAC has continually updated the designated busking locations to ensure busking contributes to a more conducive environment and complements the infrastructure and new developments in the area.&nbsp; It has regular dialogues with enforcement agencies such as the Police, the Land Transport Authority and the National Environment Agency, as well as site owners and partners such as the Orchard Road Business Association and Chinatown Business Association.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sites are chosen with adequate human traffic and sufficient space to minimise public congestion and inconvenience to pedestrians and motorists.&nbsp; NAC has recently completed a review of the Busking Scheme to streamline the conduct of the busking activities. At present, there are 109 busking spots islandwide and buskers have been asked to pick five locations for their performances of which three of the five spots can be along Orchard Road.<sup>4</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAC is aware that Orchard Road is especially popular with buskers. Fourteen spots along Orchard Road have been designated for busking activities. The designated busking locations are spatially separated to avoid congestion at particular locations and to complement STB&rsquo;s recent revamp of Orchard Road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to assure Miss Low that the new rules will not adversely impact the cultivation of a vibrant streetscape.&nbsp; There are sufficient busking locations for our buskers to perform at.&nbsp;

&nbsp;To ensure that Singaporeans continue to have convenient access to post offices, the IDA has guidelines which SingPost, as the Public Postal Licensee, has to comply with.&nbsp; These guidelines ensure that there are sufficient post offices located within or near residential, commercial and industrial estates.&nbsp; In particular, a post office must be sited in every HDB New Town.&nbsp; In cases where the town population exceeds 100,000, there must be a second post office that is at least 3 km from the original outlet<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from post offices, there is a range of other options the public can choose to pay bills for public services.&nbsp; Bills can be paid at counters set up at the respective government agencies.&nbsp; As an alternative, members of the public can also use Internet e-banking, SingPost&rsquo;s Self-service Automated Machines (SAMs) and AXS automated payment machines.&nbsp; There are currently about 270 SAMs and 560 AXS machines throughout Singapore.&nbsp; Most are accessible 24 hours, seven days a week.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current density of post office branches, the network of self-service machines and increasing availability of Internet e-payment, have been adequate in enabling Singaporeans to conveniently pay bills for public services.&nbsp;

Under NParks&rsquo; draft Master Plan for Sungei<p align=left>Column: 3467<p> Buloh Wetland Reserve, buffer zones would be introduced to protect the rich biodiversity cores within the wetland.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Third, NParks is linking up our parks with nature reserves via tree-lined roads and park connectors so that together, they act as larger ecological entities which can better support bird and other wildlife habitats.&nbsp; The cluster around Bukit Batok Nature Park, Bukit Batok Town Park and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is one such example.&nbsp; NParks is also studying the feasibility of building a link-way across the Bukit Timah Expressway to re-establish wildlife connectivity between the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Central Catchment Nature Reserve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To protect our coastal and marine biodiversity, coastal areas with rich biodiversity such as those at Labrador and Sungei Buloh have been gazetted as nature reserves.&nbsp; Other sites of marine biodiversity significance such as Sisters&rsquo; Islands have been identified as Nature Areas within URA&rsquo;s Special and Detailed Controls Plans.&nbsp; Marine conservation projects, such as the coral nursery established by NParks, NUS, NEA and Keppel Corporation, are also important components of our conservation efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To better manage our coastal and marine environment, including the protection of biodiversity, a Technical Committee on Coastal and Marine Environment (TCCME) comprising NParks and relevant government agencies was set up in 2008.&nbsp; We have in place stringent rules and regulations to guide our maritime activities.&nbsp; One key measure is the requirement for an Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) to be put in place to ensure that development projects do not adversely affect our biodiversity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Singapore remains rich in terrestrial and marine biodiversity today, despite being small and highly urbanised.&nbsp; This has been achieved through deliberate efforts made at balancing development with nature conservation.&nbsp; We will continue to adopt a pragmatic approach and conserve our natural heritage as much as possible.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 3467<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:INTERIM DISABILITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME FOR THE ELDERLY (IDAPE) SCHEME--><!--END_COL_TITLE:INTERIM DISABILITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME FOR THE ELDERLY (IDAPE) SCHEME:::3468--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eye infections caused by coloured contact lenses are not that common.&nbsp; Over the past&nbsp;three years, there were about&nbsp;six cases a year of eye infections seen at our public hospitals, due to the use of cosmetic contact lenses, of which coloured contact lenses form a sub-set.&nbsp; This is probably because the usage of such lenses is low.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We control the sale of contact lenses to protect consumer interest, as ill-fitted contacts can cause complications including conjunctivitis, allergic reactions, corneal abrasions and corneal ulcers, which may lead to deterioration of vision. Under the Optometrists and Opticians Act, only registered optometrists and contact lens practice (CLP) opticians can prescribe, dispense or sell contact lenses.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, importers and distributors of contact lenses, including those who operate online, are required under the Health Products (Medical Devices) Regulations to maintain distribution and complaint records.&nbsp; If they are aware of any adverse events associated with the use of the contact lenses that they had imported or supplied in Singapore, they are required by law to inform the Health Sciences Authority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We do not allow companies to sell contact lenses on-line directly to consumers. Companies can supply contact lenses only to qualified persons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the past&nbsp;three years, there have been&nbsp;three cases of successful prosecution on those practising optometry or selling contact lenses illegally.&nbsp; The Ministry is currently investigating several cases relating to the sale of contact lenses on the Internet.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We maintain close surveillance of the situation and will take relevant enforcement and public health action when needed. The enforcement against Internet sale of contact lenses is particularly challenging as the owners of the websites are often elusive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Consumers have an important role to play to safeguard their own vision: Do not buy contact lenses from unlicensed vendors over the internet or elsewhere. Those who wish to use contact lenses should undergo proper eye examination and contact lens fitting by qualified optometrists or CLP opticians.&nbsp; We will carry out regular public education efforts on this subject.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 3469<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:READING ABILITIES OF PRIMARY ONE STUDENTS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:READING ABILITIES OF PRIMARY ONE STUDENTS:::3474--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>READING ABILITIES OF PRIMARY ONE STUDENTS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Ong Seh Hong </B>asked the Minister for Education (a) over the last&nbsp;five years, what is the number of Primary One students who have reading difficulties when they start school; (b) what is being done to help them catch up with the rest of the class; and (c) which are the vulnerable groups and whether efforts to encourage preschool education have been successful.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3471<p><B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last&nbsp;five years, around 12% to14% of the children who entered Primary&nbsp;One had very weak oral English and literacy skills.&nbsp; Their knowledge of the English alphabet was incomplete and they were not able to recognise simple English words.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were also not able to understand very simple oral instructions in English.&nbsp; These pupils are identified in January each year and provided with additional support through the Learning Support Programme (LSP).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LSP is a specialised early intervention programme.&nbsp; The aim is to teach these children basic language and literacy skills as well as word attack strategies so that they can read and access learning in the regular classes as soon as possible.&nbsp; The LSP is implemented by Learning Support Co-ordinators (LSCs) who are qualified teachers specially trained by MOE in reading intervention.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LSP was reviewed and enhanced in 2005.&nbsp; The enhanced LSP is currently implemented in all primary schools at Primary&nbsp;One and Two.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 45% of the children in the LSP are able to pass their schools&rsquo; English Language examinations and read at a level that commensurate with their age by the end of Primary One.&nbsp; Another 20% are able to do by the end of Primary Two.&nbsp; The remaining pupils had made considerable improvements in their reading skills although the reading gap had not been totally eliminated.&nbsp; Although the LSP does not extend beyond Primary Two, these students would continue to be monitored and supported by their teachers through school-based supplementary and remedial lessons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For better results, we believe that we should be working upstream. Data from MOE has also shown that children from lower income households who do not attend pre-school are more likely to experience difficulties.&nbsp; Since 2006, MOE has been focusing its efforts and resources on helping children to attend pre-school, especially those from lower-income families to help them level up opportunities early in life.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preliminary joint efforts by MOE, MCYS and Grassroots Organisations in the outreach programme to reduce the percentage of children not attending pre-school are bearing results. With the measures and efforts in place, we have reduced the percentage of those entering Primary&nbsp;One without any pre-school education from more than 4% to about 2.5%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, we are continuing with our efforts to reach out to children who are not enrolled in pre-school. We have sent the list of these children to the Grassroot Advisers and we urge grassroots leaders to conduct the outreach early to provide the necessary assistance to the children and their families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides putting in place an outreach programme to help reduce the percentage of children not attending pre-school, MOE has been providing Focused Language Assistance in Reading, or FLAiR, to selected second year kindergarten (K2) children since 2007. Under the FLAiR project, trained personnel, called Pro-FLAiRs, provide focused assistance to K2 children who have difficulties with English, as identified by their kindergarten teachers. The Pro-FLAiRs will help the children in speaking, reading and other uses of English daily through dedicated time on a one-to-one basis or in small groups. Feedback from kindergartens and parents has shown that the children have benefited from the <p align=left>Column: 3473<p>intervention. As FLAiR is relatively new, MOE will continue to look into ways to further improve the programme.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><p align=left>Column: 3473<p><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SECOND MEDICAL SCHOOL--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SECOND MEDICAL SCHOOL:::3474--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SECOND MEDICAL SCHOOL</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Fatimah Lateef </B>asked the Minister for Education in view of the overwhelming and increasing number of high quality and eligible applicants to the medical school every year, whether there are plans to start a second medical school in Singapore (excluding Duke-NUS Medical School which is a graduate medical school programme).</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investment in medical talent should be driven primarily by Singapore&rsquo;s health-care needs, and not only by the number of eligible applicants to the medical school.&nbsp; To keep pace with needs from an ageing population for example, MOE in consultation with MOH had decided to increase the annual medical intake of the National University of Singapore&rsquo;s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine from 250 to 260 for Academic Year (AY) 2008.&nbsp; There are plans to gradually increase this further to 300 in AY2011.&nbsp; The Duke-National University of Singapore (NUS) Graduate Medical School will also have an intake of 50 students a year at steady state to augment our medical manpower needs.&nbsp; It would also be in Singapore&rsquo;s interests to ensure a good spread of talent across all disciplines at the tertiary-level to benefit other sectors in our economy.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH is currently studying Singapore&rsquo;s medium and long-term health-care needs carefully and their implications on demand for medical manpower.

This increase was consistent with the trend seen in the past 10 years.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promoting an emotionally resilient society is one of our priorities, whether in good time or bad. The Health Promotion Board has an active nationwide workplace mental health education programme, called \"Treasure Your Mind\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the current economic downturn, HPB has updated it. For working adults, there are workshops to equip them with the skills to manage day to day stresses with a practical and positive frame of mind. They will also be taught to understand and recognise depression and anxiety, in order to seek help early. Specific courses for supervisors and union leaders provide knowledge on how to render support to other employees or refer them for appropriate help. HPB will work with SNEF, NTUC, and MOM to reach out to vulnerable employees and their families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we have set up an employers-led alliance that brings together like-minded employers from various sectors to champion workplace mental wellbeing. This is led by Mr Hsieh Fu Hua, CEO of Singapore Exchange (SGX). They have identified a set of good practices to promote employee mental well-being and will encourage other employers to adopt them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the community, talks, seminars and forums will be conducted at community clubs, CDCs, public libraries and other public venues, to address the psycho-emotional impact of the economic crisis on the individual, the family and the community.&nbsp; HPB has also brought together several NGOs to collaborate and implement such programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next month, a public education campaign on Optimism for Mental Resilience will be rolled out.&nbsp; This aims to reach every Singaporean, with the message that \"bad times don&rsquo;t last forever\", and motivate everyone to take charge by adopting a positive attitude so that they will emerge stronger from this crisis.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Residents who have psychiatric conditions are reviewed by psychiatrists from the Institute of Mental Health, who visit the welfare homes weekly.&nbsp; If they are assessed to be unsuitable for residence in a welfare home, they would be hospitalised at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for treatment.&nbsp; Last year, there were&nbsp;five such cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the chronic psychiatric residents in the welfare homes were long stay patients of IMH, who had been transferred to the welfare homes as they no longer require hospitalisation, but did not have families to return to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The welfare homes provide basic care which includes meals, accommodation, social activities, training and job assignments matched to the residents&rsquo; capabilities.&nbsp; All residents staying in the welfare homes have an individual rehabilitation programme developed for them.&nbsp; Those who can do simple chores will participate in work programmes where they will receive an allowance.&nbsp; The more able residents are given opportunities to go out and work during the day, to prepare them for eventual discharge from the Homes.&nbsp; Residents will be considered for discharge if they have caregivers who are able to take care them or if they are able to find jobs and live independently.&nbsp; The social workers at the homes will provide the necessary assistance with housing or employment arrangements, and the discharged residents will continue to be supervised for up to one year after discharge.&nbsp; Residents with psychiatric conditions are only discharged into the community if they have family or caregivers&rsquo; support.&nbsp; Those who are not discharged would remain in the welfare homes, or be transferred to nursing homes if their medical conditions deteriorate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The majority of mentally ill patients can and do live meaningful and productive lives in the community; it is only a small minority who are at risk of being violent and aggressive.
