The number of tourists who visit Orchard Road has grown from 4.7 million in 2003 to an all-time high of 7.1 million in 2006.&nbsp; This means that about 73% of all tourists who visit Singapore make a trip down to Orchard Road.&nbsp; Orchard Road is internationally known.&nbsp; The magazine for the Swiss International Airlines, <I>Swiss Magazine,</I> for example, named Orchard Road as one of the top&nbsp;10 great shopping streets in the world for 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, with fierce competition among existing and upcoming global cities, there is a need to inject new ideas for constant rejuvenation to give fresh appeal.&nbsp; Government has already taken the first few steps in this direction.&nbsp; The Singapore Tourism Board has helped launch late-night shopping every Saturday, when shops open till 11.00 pm in the evening. &nbsp;STB has also recently announced the details of the $40-million mall enhancement works.&nbsp; This followed active consultation of Orchard stakeholders.&nbsp; The works aim to enhance the appeal of Orchard Road by introducing lush landscaping, ambient lighting and&nbsp; improvements in the infrastructure.&nbsp; The Urban Redevelopment Authority has also put in place incentive schemes to help retailers and building owners in Orchard Road enhance the existing developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also released three sites for&nbsp;new developments on Orchard Road&nbsp;- Ion Orchard, Somerset Orchard and Orchard Central. These new developments will add about 131,000 square metres of gross shop space to Orchard Road by 2009, which is about 26% of the total current shop space in Orchard Road.&nbsp; This will <p align=left>Column: 1600<p>pave the way for retailers to bring in flagship stores with new brands and allow existing brands to expand their presence in Orchard Road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For renowned global cities, key shopping streets have always served as an icon of vibrancy.&nbsp; Much has been done to improve Orchard Road's attractiveness as a premier shopping street.&nbsp; We will continue to do more to position Orchard Road as a must-visit destination for locals and tourists alike.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n</div>\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>The Economy and Cost Competitiveness</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while 2007 was a good year for the economy but towards the end of the year, the global economy began to be&nbsp;uncertain due to the global sub-prime crisis.&nbsp; In making a forecast for 2008, what assumptions did the Ministry of Trade and Industry make with respect to the sub-prime crisis on the state of the US economy?&nbsp; Can we expect another strong <p align=left>Column: 1601<p>growth year in Singapore if the US goes into a recession?&nbsp; In other words, is our economy already decoupled from the US economy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a world leader in pushing the free trade agenda and negotiating FTAs.&nbsp; In&nbsp;promoting FTAs, MTI has raisedexpectations among our local companies that FTAs would provide increased opportunities in markets overseas.&nbsp; But in reality, our companies have not seen this increase.&nbsp; Can the Minister explain the reason for this slow penetration, and what initiatives have been put in place to facilitate our companies&nbsp; taking advantage of the FTAs that we have signed?&nbsp; I think that opportunities are tremendous, and we should help our companies to benefit from them after having done all the hard work in securing the FTAs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major issue that the Minister must address this year is the one on cost competitiveness of businesses.&nbsp; As I mentioned in the debate on the&nbsp;Budget speech, costs are rising rapidly, and this is an urgent problem but the Minister for Finance failed to address this in this year's Budget.&nbsp; We need to help these companies to tide over this cost crunch over the short term.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister what has all these cost increases done to Singapore's cost competitiveness, and whether any multi-national companies have raised concerns with the Ministry on the issue, and whether he has seen any companies wanting to relocate outside Singapore as a result?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, business costs have been going up in all areas and quite steeply too.&nbsp; The policy of strengthening the Singapore dollar has helped us, but we know that there is only so much that we can do.&nbsp; But the Government can do quite a lot for our businesses in two other important areas.&nbsp; First of all, in the area of manpower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1602<p>In respect to manpower, the problem is severe and affects businesses across all sectors.&nbsp; The overheated economy left us unprepared for the tight market that came about.&nbsp; While the Government has helped in relaxing quotas for some industries, we cannot bring in foreign skilled and semi-skilled workers fast enough to ease this crunch.&nbsp; The Government needs to quickly review its policies to allow labour from non-traditional sources to be brought in.&nbsp; For example, for the Integrated Resorts (IRs), we have huge staffing needs.&nbsp; Our current regulations, for example, do not classify workers from the Philippines as ordinarily eligible for such jobs.&nbsp; There is also a similar problem in many other sectors.&nbsp; MTI needs to address this issue with MOM.&nbsp; Surely the fact that a suitable worker can be deployed is more important than&nbsp;where he comes from, and therefore greater flexibility is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, to alleviate the problem of rising rentals, I think we have done rightly to release transitionary space.&nbsp; I hope&nbsp;MTI could coordinate with the various Ministries to remove any impediments which may exist in companies trying to retrofit such spaces to allow them to move in quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past,&nbsp;in addressing cost competitiveness, we gave rental and property tax rebates to reduce costs for companies.&nbsp; These rebates benefited SMEs the most.&nbsp; We should consider doing the same this year, and I would like to urge the Minister to help companies by persuading the Minister for Finance to work out some off-Budget measures for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on rentals and land pricing.&nbsp; I like to question the role of JTC.&nbsp; Lately, we have seen JTC moving more towards ploughing its properties into REITs.&nbsp; Ascendas was formed and, as a result, we have seen cost of rentals going up for properties that are managed by Ascendas.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1603<p>Recently, JTC is also trying to plough some of its properties to Mapletree to form REITs.&nbsp; And I question whether the Government has shifted from the policy of providing affordable industrial and commercial space for our companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second policy level issue concerns how industrial land is priced.&nbsp; It appears that the Government has also shifted its policy on industrial land pricing from the earlier policy to match prices in competing economies.&nbsp; If we allow market forces to determine our industrial land prices, then businesses engaged in certain strategic sectors may no longer be able to compete with companies in competing economies, which may not necessarily be at our stage of development and may offer companies more attractive land costs.&nbsp; For example, the semi-conductor industry.&nbsp; China is already competing with Singapore in this area, and they offer, of course,&nbsp;much cheaper land than Singapore can.&nbsp; And unless we have a differential strategy for pricing of industrial land, we may end up not being able to compete with many of these economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I worry about the erosion of our cost competitiveness due to the reasons that I stated above. While I think&nbsp;we could have avoided some of these issues, that is not important right now.&nbsp; What we really need is for someone in Government to look at what can be done to keep Singapore's costs manageable for all businesses.&nbsp; And I think the Minister for Trade and Industry is the best champion for this.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

One of the ways to achieve that, according to <p align=left>Column: 1604<p>the Finance Minister, is to increase the investment in world-class manpower and new R&amp;D capabilities.&nbsp; The recent A*STAR Annual Report discloses that $5.4 billion has been allocated to engage in R&amp;D from 2006-2010.&nbsp; Budget 2008 would probably move this figure even higher.&nbsp; It is reported that the Agency has a team of 3,200, comprising 2,000 researchers, of whom about 1,200 hold PhD qualifications, and a third of them are Singaporeans.&nbsp; The Report also states that commercialisation of technology is a key priority for A*STAR.&nbsp; It has, to date, licensed out 100 technologies and spun off 19 active companies.&nbsp; My questions are:\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) How many Singaporean researchers with PhD qualifications have been nurtured by A*STAR, since the agency was established in 2002?&nbsp; While it is important to attract whales, we must understand that these mammals are migratory in nature.&nbsp; Singapore needs guppies, and local guppies to be precise, to stay and grow the R&amp;D capabilities.&nbsp; Further, we should not have guppies' mindset, or we will always be overwhelmed by whales.&nbsp; Can we become sharks instead of just guppies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Does the Government believe that this number is a good achievement in relation to the billions A*STAR spent on R&amp;D and human capital so far?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; How much, in money value, has the commercialisation of technology in the 19 spin-off companies contributed to A*STAR or the Singapore economy to date?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; As Singapore progressively increases its investments in world-class R&amp;D capabilities, what are MTI's strategy and target for A*STAR to help Singapore achieve its top quality economy?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is not only a phenomenon facing Singapore businesses and businesses based in Singapore.&nbsp; However, based on the feedback received from small businesses through our dialogues, eg,&nbsp;a recent survey by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, many are feeling the pressures of rising business costs and are concerned about&nbsp;the impact on their growth.&nbsp; Clearly, businesses understand the need for upgrading, longer-term development and innovation.&nbsp; What many fear is the sharp rise in costs and the erosion of the cost competitiveness in the global market.&nbsp; Many of our SMEs have plans or are diversifying their businesses overseas.&nbsp; Rising business costs, however, will impact the competitiveness of our SMEs and their ability to grow.&nbsp; Just a week ago, one of the industrial park manufacturers shared with me that he had just had a customer cancel an order with his company.&nbsp; The reason given was that Singapore products were getting too expensive due to our high cost and the weakening US dollar.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Budget encourages companies to invest and innovate and upgrade through the various training&nbsp;schemes for start-ups.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for our businesses to continue to innovate and upgrade.&nbsp; But beyond this, we need to also ensure that we enable our businesses to continue to grow and not lose hope in the light of strong competition and rising costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For small businesses, investments in innovation for long term growth are the right pillars for success.&nbsp; However, they must still manage their short-term costs to stay in business.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many small businesses may be driving strong business growth, but sharp rises in business costs will impact their cash flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1606<p>In a report in 2007, online credit checking firm, EBCM, noted that small businesses in the UK are indeed faced with rising costs and increasing red tape which prevent them from focusing on what really matters for their business, meaning the efficient running of their businesses and customer service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we drive our major initiatives locally, many companies are calling for pro-enterprise measures so that smaller companies can gain greater access to public projects.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for Trade and Industry to share with us what pro-enterprise measures are in place to enable our local enterprises to seize the opportunity and grow locally while still striving in the global economy.&nbsp; What is being done to provide opportunities for SMEs to develop their businesses that will boost their competitiveness in the long run?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I will agree that the impact might be less compared to, say, 10 years ago due to higher volume of intra-Asia and Asia-Europe trade, but I believe that there will still be some impact.&nbsp; Does the Ministry have any plans to diversify or spread our risks and focus on new areas for development while enhancing existing trade with new emerging economies?&nbsp; If so, which are these countries, and what are the plans ahead to spread our portfolio wide?&nbsp; I would also like to know what are our key strategies for China, as I understand we have been spending substantial amount of time and resources, and there are several cities with potential within China, from <p align=left>Column: 1607<p>coastal to inner cities.&nbsp;

In terms of enabling our SMEs to compete effectively in the global market, I would like to know MTI's success rate in our current efforts to enable our SMEs to do business overseas.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also aware that the success rates vary between established SMEs and growth SMEs.&nbsp; The established SMEs or home-grown businesses are typically more successful when brought overseas with trade missions and are often able to benefit from politically-driven deals overseas.&nbsp; However, the growth SMEs and those trying to establish themselves often complain that they find it difficult to get orders from trips and trade fairs that are being facilitated.&nbsp; These are often expensive and entrepreneurs find it difficult to get returns on investments.&nbsp; What is our current success rate with established SMEs and with growth SMEs, and those just trying to establish themselves overseas?&nbsp; What are MTI's strategies to improve our success rates to grow our SMEs and generate demand for them overseas?&nbsp; And how can we improve the investments made to grow our SMEs, and what are MTI's strategies to help them internationalise and generate demand?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to MTI's internationalisation efforts, are there alternative strategies that MTI has or is considering <p align=left>Column: 1608<p>to better the success rate for internationalising our growth and budding SMEs?&nbsp; For example, how successful are we in partnering SME and MNC with the global network?&nbsp;&nbsp;An MNC with a global network of 100 countries is certainly a more efficient channel to help an SME extend its reach and create market demand if it has a good product that can be incorporated as part of the MNC's sales offerings.&nbsp; I think we have a multi-pronged approach and various networks that we can tap on.&nbsp; However, SMEs, especially growth companies, need a lot of guidance to be able to exploit Government funding and internationalisation programmes.&nbsp; Those not familiar to new markets will certainly need more guidance and resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue I see is that many of our local businesses also lack the understanding and capability to exploit MTI's internationalisation efforts, tax schemes and programmes to capitalise on R&amp;D and innovation.&nbsp; I think the Government tries hard within the MTI family.&nbsp; However, they are only able, given their limited resources, to focus on growth companies to enable them to become strong regional and global companies.&nbsp; In reality, the majority of our businesses are&nbsp;not even there yet.&nbsp; It takes hard work and resources.&nbsp; Otherwise, the amount of money spent on grants and growth programmes will not yield the ROIs.&nbsp; It will take a lot of hard work on the ground&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;manpower, funding programmes&nbsp;&ndash; but I think the Government needs to do it nonetheless by providing sufficient manpower and resources to hand hold these businesses to make this work.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Over the years, we have set aside billions of dollars in innovation&nbsp;R&amp;D.&nbsp; Could the Minister update us on how many Singapore-origin patents have been filed so far and what are some of the KPIs that we have set?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the concept of R&amp;D innovation remains fuzzy and narrowly defined, so much so that the buzz of innovation extends barely beyond&nbsp;people in white coats working in the labs.&nbsp; In most liveable cities in the world, the buzzword&nbsp;is, in fact, \"social innovation\"&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the process by which innovative ideas, products and services are generated and executed for the direct benefit of society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic innovation, on the other hand, is driven by capitalistic rents&nbsp;and social benefits as a derivative.&nbsp;

By 2005, Wikipedia has about two million articles in more than one hundred languages and 1.4 billion page views a month.&nbsp; But it employs only a grand total of one staff and has a monthly overhead of about US$5,000; the rest are volunteers.&nbsp; Bell Lab, one of the most innovative institutions in the world, has 25,000 researchers in the 1950's but by 2003, as part of France's Alcatel-Lucent, has only 1,000 researchers.&nbsp; In view of the rise of collaborative innovation, could the Minister define the strategy and the eco-system it intends to put in place for <p align=left>Column: 1611<p>innovation initiative to succeed?&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</B> Sir,&nbsp;first, let me&nbsp;thank Members for their comments and suggestions.&nbsp; As pointed out by Members, 2008 will be a challenging year.&nbsp; The global environment is more uncertain and we face increasing cost pressures.&nbsp; How do we remain competitive, grow the economy, and create jobs?&nbsp; These are the key issues raised by Members.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a good run in the last four years.&nbsp; Our economy has enjoyed 18 consecutive quarters of positive growth.&nbsp; Real GDP grew by a cumulative 36.3% from 2003 till 2007.&nbsp; We have created nearly 600,000 jobs.&nbsp; Not just more jobs, but high quality jobs.&nbsp; From 2004 to 2007, about two-thirds of new jobs taken up by Singapore citizens were in the professional, managerial, executive, and technician or the PMET category.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages have grown by a total of 17.4% during this period.&nbsp; Consumer prices, on the other hand, have increased by 5.3%, though the main increase took place in the second half of 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strong position today did not come about by accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, Mr Inderjit Singh, during the Budget debate,&nbsp;described our approach as \"growth at all costs\" and therefore one of the primary causes for the increase in the cost&nbsp;pressures.&nbsp; I think Mr Inderjit Singh&nbsp;exaggerates for impact.&nbsp; I am sure he is not advocating that we plan to just grow at a comfortable rate and forego opportunities if they do not fit our plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1612<p>I prefer to describe&nbsp;our approach as growing strategically, not tactically, by developing the&nbsp;clusters that we are competitive in&nbsp;and tapping the opportunities that arise within these clusters and across the&nbsp;clusters.&nbsp; Through this approach, we are also better able to address the resource needs and the&nbsp;cost pressures arising within each cluster, a concern raised by Ms Jessica Tan.&nbsp; I hope that from a better understanding of our strategic clusters, Members will appreciate that our economy is now more resilient than ever.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mr Teo Ser Luck and Mr Zaqy Mohamad will also be convinced that we are building a top quality economy&nbsp;&ndash; one that is well diversified across sectors and markets, with a strong external wing that allows us to seize new opportunities overseas, and an innovative economy powered by R&amp;D, enterprise, and entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Growing our market share in these strategic clusters, exploring new growth opportunities, building more economic linkages, and entrenching the spirit of innovation throughout the economy will give us the competitive edge we need in order&nbsp;to thrive and succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we operate in a fast-paced and rapidly changing world where there is intense competition.&nbsp; To build up our economic clusters, we need clear strategic directions for each of the clusters.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to plan ahead, anticipate needs, seize the opportunities when they arise, and work hard to resolve any resource constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me illustrate by going through the key clusters that we are concentrating on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on chemicals cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong Island today has developed into one of the world's top three&nbsp;oil refining centres and a leading chemicals hub.&nbsp; It is home to more than 90 companies with investments in excess of $30 billion.&nbsp; But even as we speak, the Middle Eastern countries are diversifying from oil and gas production to <p align=left>Column: 1613<p>building petrochemical hubs of their own.&nbsp; China and India are also building up their own capabilities to meet their own needs.&nbsp; For us to remain a top petrochemical hub, we need to anchor a critical mass of refining and cracking capabilities in Singapore, which can in turn catalyse other developments in the chemicals cluster.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petrochemical cycle peaks approximately every seven to eight&nbsp;years.&nbsp; In other words, we do not land a chemical cracker project at a time of our choosing.&nbsp; In fact, we have to catch the cycle.&nbsp; When we found out that ExxonMobil was planning to invest in the new&nbsp;world-scale cracker, we went the extra mile to secure the project.&nbsp; We knew that one critical consideration for ExxonMobil was sufficient space to integrate the new project with its existing facilities in Singapore.&nbsp; As a result, the Government proactively diverted and realigned a stretch of Jurong Island Highway, together with 17 live pipelines and four core fibre optic cables.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shell cracker project is also illustrative.&nbsp; The industrial land was prepared well in advance so that Shell could break ground and start work within a month of their final decision.&nbsp; Such advance planning is one of the reasons why we are attractive to investors.&nbsp; The Shell investment led in turn to the recent announcement by Lanxess AG that they will invest &euro;400 million or over $800 million&nbsp;in a state-of-the-art butyl rubber plant.&nbsp; Lanxess AG came in because they knew that they can rely on the feedstock from the Shell cracker by the time their plant is up and running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two multi-billion dollar projects are expected to double our current ethylene production to about four million tonnes per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;They open up a whole range of investment possibilities in downstream petrochemicals and in specialty chemicals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1614<p>The electronics cluster provides another&nbsp;example of competitive pressures&nbsp;that&nbsp;we have to strategically seize the opportunities in order to move up the value chain.&nbsp; From our roots in assembling simple transistor parts, we moved into hard disk drives, and now we have moved into semiconductor wafers.&nbsp; Wafer fabrication produces high value-add jobs, anchors capital and knowledge, and also attracts other innovation-intensive activities to Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition for wafer fabs&nbsp;is intense, coming from both developing and developed economies.&nbsp; Moreover, industry players tend to invest their wafer fabs in one single location over time, so as to achieve economies of scale.&nbsp; If we miss out on a single window of opportunity, we, in fact, miss out on a whole slate of future investment opportunities, and hand the advantage over to our competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we have successfully landed 14 wafer fab plants.&nbsp; As global demand grows, we would need more than 20 wafer fabs in Singapore to consolidate our position and to&nbsp;establish critical mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy for the transport engineering sector is to push the envelope.&nbsp; For the marine sector, we have successfully gone beyond ship repair and ship building to specialised oil and gas platforms.&nbsp; Now we set our sights on the air transport sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is located in the fastest growing air travel market in the world, accounting&nbsp;for 36% of new aircraft orders by value.&nbsp; We have therefore moved to take advantage of this.&nbsp; The aerospace industry is one of the fastest growing industries in Singapore.&nbsp; It registered a 10% growth last year, reaching a record $6.9 billion, and employs 19,000 people, the majority of whom are Singaporeans.&nbsp; Today, Singapore has a leadership position in the Asian aerospace industry, capturing one quarter of the Asian <p align=left>Column: 1615<p>maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago, Rolls Royce broke ground for their Singapore plant.&nbsp; It is the first in Asia to assemble and test large commercial aircraft engines.&nbsp; We faced keen competition when we tried to secure this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having this plant here is significant, because&nbsp;it moves us up the value chain, from maintenance and repair, into a whole new area of testing and assembly of aircraft engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of the aerospace industry will create good jobs.&nbsp; I was pleased to learn that an aerospace career programme organised by the Association of Aerospace Industries Singapore (AAIS) and its partners during the Singapore Airshow gathered overwhelming response, with 1,100 students participating.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its launch in 2005, NTU's aeronautical engineering programme has been oversubscribed several times. &nbsp;According to NTU, the eventual entry cut-off points were similar to those for Medicine.&nbsp; Obviously, many students see aerospace engineering as an exciting course leading to an even more exciting career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have gone after wafer fab plants and aerospace engineering not just because they provide good economic benefits, but also because they drive the growth of supporting industries where many of our SMEs are.&nbsp; Precision Engineering (PE) is one cluster that has benefited from other strategic clusters.&nbsp; In the early years, PE grew predominantly from supporting our electronics sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;As other low cost locations became more attractive to low-end electronics manufacturing, we developed PE to support other sectors, such as the growing aerospace industry.&nbsp; This allowed us to reduce the pain of restructuring away from lower-end electronics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1616<p>About 90% of the companies in the PE sector are SMEs, contributing to 42% of the sector's output.&nbsp; PE SMEs have been constantly upgrading themselves to move up the value chain and create higher skilled jobs.&nbsp; Our SMEs have reinvented themselves from manufacturers of ordinary commodity parts to producers of higher-value products and systems.&nbsp; As a result, we now have a large pool of suppliers in the PE cluster, who provide services to both local and foreign companies across diverse industries, ranging from&nbsp;the semiconductor equipment and aerospace and oil and gas equipment, to medical devices and automotive components.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic strategy is also&nbsp;to diversify across sectors.&nbsp; That was the driving force for developing the Biomedical Sciences or the BMS cluster.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BMS makes sense for us.&nbsp; It fits in with our strength and&nbsp; capabilities.&nbsp; Its manufacturing is not easily uprooted, and the heavy investment required in science and technology cannot be easily replicated by our competitors.&nbsp; It is high value-added in nature and is resilient to economic downturns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the six years since we embarked on developing the BMS sector, BMS manufacturing output has almost quadrupled in size.&nbsp; Today, BMS manufacturing alone accounts for 5.5% of Singapore's GDP, creating over 11,500 jobs.&nbsp; Singapore has established itself as a highly competitive and trusted site for pharmaceutical bulk actives and secondary manufacturing.&nbsp; But we face very stiff competition with other developed centres such as Boston, the Bay Area, Ireland and Puerto Rico.&nbsp; We need to continue investing in scientific, industrial and physical infrastructure, such as the Biopolis and the Tuas Biomedical Park.&nbsp; We also need to train our talent pool through our educational institutions, reskill our employees <p align=left>Column: 1617<p>through conversion programmes, and support company-level training in order to meet future demands for manpower in the BMS sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we develop our strategic clusters, we also ensure that the General Manufacturing cluster, which has many SMEs, can tap on the many opportunities made available.&nbsp; The Government's approach is to help these companies to upgrade through the Local Enterprise and Association Development, or&nbsp;LEAD, programme.&nbsp; So far, SPRING has tied up with 16 industry associations to develop their sectors.&nbsp; Each industry association accounts for between 0.1%-0.3% of our GDP.&nbsp; So, collectively, the 16 industry associations contribute some 3% of our GDP.&nbsp; The Government and the associations have pumped in some $78 million to the SMEs' projects.&nbsp; When realised, these projects are expected to contribute $1.4 billion in value added and $3.4 billion in revenue as well as create 10,000 new jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is the furniture sector, which has evolved from mostly small family-run businesses to become a global player.&nbsp; Its output grew 15% annually in the past five years to more than $2.4 billion today.&nbsp; Many Singapore furniture companies maintain their higher value-adding activities&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;like R&amp;D, design, marketing and IT&nbsp;&ndash; in Singapore, while leveraging on innovative design to compete successfully overseas.&nbsp; HTL, Koda and Design Studio are listed among the top 200 furniture manufacturers in the world, and they are able to keep their most valuable activities in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have spoken extensively on our strategic manufacturing clusters.&nbsp; We also have a robust strategy for developing our services.&nbsp; Tourism is one example.&nbsp; I will leave to MOS Iswaran to speak on this later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1618<p> Beyond developing our strategic clusters, we need to expand our economic space,&nbsp;as suggested by Mr Teo Ser Luck.&nbsp; We grow our external wing in three ways.&nbsp; First, we deepen our presence in existing markets.&nbsp; In the West, we want to deepen our links with top export destinations like the US and the EU.&nbsp; In Asia, we tap on the rapid growth of China and India through our strong trade and investment links.&nbsp; For example, since the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, or CECA, came into force in August 2005, our total bilateral trade with India has increased by more than 40%.&nbsp; India has moved up two notches to become Singapore's 11th largest trading partner in 2007.&nbsp; Closer to home, we are committed to ASEAN.&nbsp; The Blueprint of the ASEAN Economic Community, which we signed last year, aims for a single market and production base in ASEAN by 2015.&nbsp; There are many prospects for Singapore companies when we achieve such an environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second approach is to seek opportunities in emerging markets.&nbsp; We have new platforms for economic and business cooperation with the Middle East, where some of our companies have clinched significant deals.&nbsp; The Gulf Cooperation Council-Singapore Free Trade Agreement was substantially concluded in end January this year.&nbsp; For Latin America, the Singapore-Peru FTA and the Singapore-Mercosur MOU, concluded last year, will enhance our market access in Latin America.&nbsp; Russia has also huge economic potential for our companies.&nbsp; In April, we will host the 3rd Russia-Singapore Business Forum to showcase the business opportunities in Asia, Russia and CIS countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third approach is to continually seek to expand our network of 13 Free Trade Agreements, or FTAs.&nbsp; The value of our exports which benefited from preferential FTA tariff concessions increased <p align=left>Column: 1619<p>by more than 120% between 2004 and 2006.&nbsp; This is to address Mr Inderjit Singh's concern.&nbsp; We are indeed making full use of the FTAs that we have signed.&nbsp; IE Singapore, for example, introduced new outreach mechanisms such as an FTA Symposium and created an FTA Panel of Advisors.&nbsp; We have also conducted a series of outreach workshops last year.&nbsp; As a result, our companies enjoyed $380 million in tariff savings in the first three quarters of 2007, an increase of $60 million from the equivalent period in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking ahead, we need to continue to move up the value chain, and this calls for an innovation driven and&nbsp;knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; To drive innovation, we have invested heavily in mission-oriented R&amp;D.&nbsp; R&amp;D, as you know, is a long process.&nbsp; But I am glad to report that we are making good progress, as Mr Low Thia Khiang noted in A*STAR's Annual Report.&nbsp; I think we all know that the key is talent, and we must keep investing heavily to build a pipeline of our local talent.&nbsp; Presently, we have a pool of more than 700 A*STAR's scholars.&nbsp; Our goal is to train 1,000 local PhDs by 2015.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our investment in R&amp;D brings real benefits to the manufacturing sector.&nbsp; Let me illustrate from the Biomedical Sciences.&nbsp; Because Singapore is able to support cutting-edge drug discovery research, several large pharmaceutical companies&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;like Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Norvatis and Takeda&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;have all set up drug discovery and development centres in Singapore.&nbsp; The base of our local and international biotechnology companies such as S*Bio, Merlion and CombinatorX is growing.&nbsp; They were seeded by EDB's Bio*One Capital, which has supported 30 innovative growth companies.&nbsp; There are also MedTech players undertaking R&amp;D in Singapore.&nbsp; So as we continue to invest in <p align=left>Column: 1620<p>our R&amp;D, we can expect more of such cross-sector benefits to accrue to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploit Technologies Pte Ltd, or Exploit, which is A*STAR's commercialisation arm, has successfully spun-off many new technologies that have been developed.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is just the beginning.&nbsp; We would continue to encourage the commercialisation of new technologies and the results of our R&amp;D efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the increasingly competitive global environment, what keep investors coming to Singapore?&nbsp; Let me quote an example from a recent project that we landed&nbsp;&ndash; Renewable Energy Cooperation from Norway.&nbsp; They recently chose Singapore to invest a multi-billion project in solar panel manufacturing.&nbsp; The President and CEO, Eric Thorsen, said, and I quote, \"Singapore does not have the cheapest land, labour or electricity,&nbsp;but it offers the best combination of such factors, along with things like access to technology centres and research programmes, market access, stability and security.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a key part of our growth strategy is to create the total package of conditions to keep Singapore competitive.&nbsp; I recognise Members' concerns about our rising costs and how these would impact on our competitiveness.&nbsp; But, really, the final factor of competitiveness is value creation.&nbsp; So my Ministry continues to monitor our competitiveness closely.&nbsp; We advanced one notch to 7th place on the Global Competitiveness Index in 2007.&nbsp; On the softer side, <I>Monocle</I> ranks Singapore as the 17th most liveable city in the world.&nbsp; In fact, MTI monitors a whole host of rankings to make sure that we continue to remain competitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With our fundamentals and growth strategy in place, what is our outlook going forward?&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh has pointed to tough global conditions.&nbsp; He is right.&nbsp; But despite these challenges, the outlook for Singapore is for slower but still healthy growth in 2008.&nbsp; MTI's <p align=left>Column: 1621<p>forecast for the Singapore economy for 2008 is 4%-6%; 6% if the US slowdown is short and shallow, and 4% if the US economy goes into a deeper and longer recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, thanks to the restructuring and reform efforts since 2001,&nbsp; Singapore is in a strong position to weather these storms.&nbsp; We have a very strong investment pipeline.&nbsp; We have built up strong market positions in our strategic clusters.&nbsp; Our global footprint is spreading.&nbsp;&nbsp;R&amp;D and innovation will take us further up the value chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore use this period to consolidate our gains, strengthen our fundamentals and position ourselves for the upturn.&nbsp; In a slower growth period like this, we must pay more attention to training and upgrading our workers to be ready for the new jobs that are coming their way.&nbsp; We will continue to address our growth constraints, restructure ourselves, identify new areas of growth and add further ballast to our economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry intends to make growth work for Singapore.&nbsp; We should not stop growing or take grow-slow approach when the going starts tough.&nbsp; I have set out how we can stay in the race, and in the lead.&nbsp; Besides remaining competitive, we should also look to set the pace, break new ground and set fresh benchmarks.&nbsp; While doing so, we keep enabling our businesses to make the most of the opportunities available.&nbsp; I believe we are on the right track, and that we have the right growth strategy for Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now address a couple of the issues raised by the Members.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked about JTC's role.&nbsp; JTC's role remains the same.&nbsp; You must look at JTC's role in two key areas&nbsp;&ndash; land and prepared industrial space like flatted factory space.&nbsp; For the flatted factory space, JTC in fact is a small player in the market.&nbsp; JTC's market share is around <p align=left>Column: 1622<p>20%.&nbsp; So we take our cue from the market and it is this sector that we are divesting because we believe that industrial space in Singapore is a fairly competitive market.&nbsp; So JTC need not stay in this space.&nbsp; JTC will concentrate on land.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the pricing of JTC's industrial factory space, this is set by the market.&nbsp; But for the pricing of land, we benchmark ourselves against our competitive locations and we are very careful to make sure we do not price ourselves out of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah asked about our efforts to promote a culture of buying Singapore products.&nbsp; We cannot force or make it mandatory for Singaporeans or Singapore agencies to buy Singapore products.&nbsp; What we do is to promote the quality, the value, the price competitiveness, the brand, and reputation of Singapore products so that Singaporeans will buy Singapore products because Singapore products give better value.&nbsp; And this is also the same approach for encouraging the exports of Singapore products and services overseas.&nbsp; So it is the same strategy, both domestic and overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, up until January, only 4,300 tourism workforce-related enrolments are <p align=left>Column: 1624<p>under WDA&rsquo;s Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications education and training.&nbsp; The shortage is quite acute.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, much still needs to be done to attract other renewable energy players in other sectors, besides the solar sector, to come to Singapore if our strategy is to develop Singapore into a centre for renewable or clean energy technologies and solutions.&nbsp; Globally and regionally, solutions are required for other areas of&nbsp; renewable and clean energy as well as energy efficiency.&nbsp; So I do not think we should just focus on one sector at a time and build up deep proficiency in one area before we focus on another area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I suggest that MTI and its agencies consider a broader-based <p align=left>Column: 1625<p>strategy in attracting renewable energy (RE) companies into Singapore, as the whole region is looking for a suite of RE technologies, ranging from biomass, biogas, biofuel, wind, wave, hydro, geothermal to solar.&nbsp; Not all RE technologies have ready applications in Singapore.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;Vestas, which is the largest manufacturer of wind turbines in the world, is setting up their Asia Pacific HQ and R&amp;D centre in Singapore.&nbsp; This company has no market here in Singapore but it is important for them to be here so that Singapore can provide a holistic solution and cater to all the RE and EE needs.&nbsp; I think the strategy to have all RE and EE solutions readily available in Singapore is clear, as this will attract countries wanting these solutions to think of Singapore straightaway and not wonder whether it is available or not.&nbsp; Yes, Singapore should be the hypermarket for RE and EE solutions. With these solutions, we can then package project financing, project management, engineering, carbon management, carbon trading, etc, ie, the whole value chain for this business which I shared in last year&rsquo;s Budget debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to attract these RE and EE technology companies to come to Singapore, I would suggest the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Provide attractive incentives for them to bring their technologies to Singapore, especially if they are prepared to set up a manufacturing facility here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Test-bedding and R&amp;D incentives.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is basically in place but can be expanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Feed-in-tariffs (FIT) to allow all the RE companies which set up here and can test-bed their technologies to also feed into the grid at preferential rates.&nbsp; Many countries, eg Germany, South Korea, Japan, Spain, California, including China, have very viable FIT models that we can learn from which have helped them grow <p align=left>Column: 1626<p>their RE sector.&nbsp; I am sure we can learn from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Net metering.&nbsp; This allows for RE generators, both small, eg, private homes and condominiums,&nbsp;and large, eg, test-bedding systems to industrial plants, to feed in the net energy produced into the grid and offset directly against retail electricity cost.&nbsp; Current EMA rules stipulate that distributed electricity fed into the grid has to pay grid charges which are 25% of total electricity cost. &nbsp;This is hefty, making, for example, solar energy generated from PV not attractive and therefore a disincentive for solar systems to be pervasive in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to clarify whether the proposals set out above are being considered by the MTI and, if not, why not.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There is growing concern that the recent high oil price is a structural shift rather than a cyclical upswing.&nbsp; The oil price has more than tripled since 2003, and it has already eroded the purchasing power of consumers, as we have seen&nbsp;the likes of petrol, utility prices and transport costs raised significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the business and industry front, high fuel cost will add on to the overall business costs, and perhaps dampen business sentiment.&nbsp;

These make for a good start to a solar future for our sunny island.&nbsp; But since we are never ones to&nbsp;rest on our laurels, and also because Singapore is a Johnny-come-lately among developed countries when it comes to solar solutions, my question for MTI is:&nbsp; what next, and can we do more?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read about the Ministry's stand on market distortion and subsidies to incentivise the use of renewable energy in Singapore and I wonder if we are being too conservative.&nbsp; Can we claim to be a leader in the field of solar energy if we are content to let market forces dictate how we deploy its use?&nbsp; We know that the main obstacle to photovoltaic adoption is cost.&nbsp; It will take years for research to lower these costs.&nbsp; Meanwhile, it is clear from examples elsewhere that the growth of grid connected markets depends on incentive programmes.&nbsp; Why do we <p align=left>Column: 1628<p>condone minor distortions and cross-subsidies in an existing retail electricity market but baulk at doing the same for renewables&nbsp;&ndash; the best long-term solution to reduce global warming?&nbsp; For example, by paying a flat rate for electricity, instead of a tariff that varies according to supply and demand, as is the case in Singapore, night-time electricity&nbsp;purchasers are cross-subsidising day-time consumption.&nbsp; Likewise, grid&nbsp;charges should reflect the cost of transmission and distribution infrastructure.&nbsp; These are currently allocated as a flat surcharge according to kilowatt hour consumed.&nbsp; But that unfairly penalises consumers located close to the power plants who end up sharing costs for all the transmission lines installed for faraway consumers.&nbsp; These cross-subsidies are small and have no significant impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we not creative enough to come up with similar solutions for PV adoption to augment measures such as the Green Mark programme?&nbsp; For example, why not go for feed-in-tariffs?&nbsp; And here I quote the sentiment of hon. Member Mr Edwin Khew, especially since it will take several years before PV contributes more than a few percent of Singapore's total electricity production, which means, for all practical purposes, the main electricity market would face no distortions at all.&nbsp; If MTI says that FITs will result in higher electricity prices, it should say how much.&nbsp; Otherwise, talk of higher prices is a smoke screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to solar energy experts I spoke to, a typical four-room HDB flat would face a surcharge of less than 60 cents per month, which is a small price to contribute to greenhouse gas reductions.&nbsp; Cost and market distortions are clearly not major barriers.&nbsp; On the other hand, by making it attractive enough for PV system contractors, competition among them will drive down costs and improve practical solutions.&nbsp; So what if it was&nbsp;sparked artificially by subsidies?&nbsp;&nbsp;More jobs will be <p align=left>Column: 1629<p>created and the accumulated know-how would give Singapore an edge.&nbsp; Our experience could be an example for the region.&nbsp;

Our basic policy tenet is that energy cost should be borne in full by end users.&nbsp; Individuals and industries should adjust their consumption of energy according to its true cost as reflected in its price.&nbsp; We do not subsidise the cost of energy because it will dampen price signals, and create the incentive to over-consume.&nbsp; There are many examples around us that bear that point out.&nbsp; Moreover, as all of us know subsidies are not sustainable in the long run,&nbsp;our best course of action is to encourage competition and ensure that markets work.&nbsp; Competition will assert downward pressure on prices and serve to benefit consumers.&nbsp; This approach is not conservative, as Ms Eunice Olsen characterises it, but I think prudent, because we want to make sure as a small economy we put in place systems that are able to withstand these kinds of global pressures and subsidies cannot withstand such pressures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To illustrate the benefits of competition, let me give you&nbsp;an example.&nbsp; In 2001, EMA introduced competition in the electricity market.&nbsp; Both businesses and households have benefited.&nbsp; Over the past seven years, as we all know, the price of fuel oil has doubled, in fact, more than doubled.&nbsp; But electricity tariffs for low tension users, which are mainly our households, has increased by only 14%, and this is despite the fact that fuel cost <p align=left>Column: 1631<p>accounts for 55% of the cost of electricity generation.&nbsp; We are currently in the final stages of liberalising the gas market and that will further enhance competition in our energy sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy security has re-emerged as a growing concern for many countries and not just Singapore.&nbsp; Mr Liang has asked about the threats other than high prices.&nbsp; Amidst intensifying global competition for resources, the global energy supply chain is vulnerable to political risk and other unforeseen circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our&nbsp;response has to be&nbsp;on two fronts.&nbsp; On the supply side, we need to diversify our sources of energy and continuously explore new fuel and energy technologies, the point that several Members have spoken out.&nbsp; The second is on the demand side, we need to be more efficient and innovative in our use of energy.&nbsp; The Minister for the&nbsp;Environment and Water Resources has outlined our efforts to promote energy efficiency last Friday and I like to elaborate on our efforts to diversify our sources of energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, about three quarters of our electricity&nbsp;are generated using piped natural gas.&nbsp; We have decided to import liquefied natural gas to diversify our supplies of fuel rendering us less prone to possible disruptions of supply.&nbsp; And I am pleased to inform Members that Singapore's efforts to import energy are on track.&nbsp; In September last year, we designated Power Gas as the&nbsp;LNG terminal operator.&nbsp; It is a natural extension of PowerGas' role as the owner and operator of the gas pipeline network in Singapore and it will ensure integration of the existing gas infrastructure and the energy terminal.&nbsp; EMA is also in the final stages of an RFP process to select the LNG \"aggregator\".&nbsp; The \"aggregator\" will consolidate demand from end users and import liquefied natural gas into <p align=left>Column: 1632<p>Singapore.&nbsp; We will announce the outcome of this RFP in the second quarter of this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In diversifying our sources of energy we have also taken steps to encourage the adoption of renewables, such as solar energy.&nbsp; These include reducing cost and facilitating grid connection, the point that Mr Edwin Khew&nbsp;was talking about.&nbsp; In June 2007, the Energy Market Company removed the registration fee of $5,000 for market participation that was previously imposed on solar installations that export to the grid.&nbsp; The wholesale licence fee by EMA has also been reduced from $1,000 to $100.&nbsp; Among other outreach and educational efforts, &nbsp;EMA has also published a handbook to provide information on the installation and connection of&nbsp;photovoltaic systems to the power grid.&nbsp; So we are doing our part in terms of reducing Government charges, those sorts of overheads, but we are eschewing subsidies that might distort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I am pleased to announce that the Government will be setting aside a further $20 million for the Solar Capability Scheme.&nbsp; This is a&nbsp;grant-based incentive to spur more innovative approaches and capability development, in the architecture, design and system integration of solar panels as part of green buildings.&nbsp; The fund will go towards offsetting part of the installation cost of solar panels for new buildings which have attained a certain level of Green Mark standard.&nbsp; EDB will be releasing more information on the scheme in due course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from providing a key resource, the energy sector also presents significant economic opportunities.&nbsp; The energy sector is already important to our economy.&nbsp; In 2006, the oil industry contributed 4.5% to Singapore's GDP.&nbsp; We will continue to build on our lead in this field and further develop a comprehensive energy cluster in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1633<p> In recent years, international concerns over climate change and environmental sustainability have spurred a greater worldwide impetus for the development and adoption of clean energy technologies.&nbsp; Clean Edge, a leading report on the industry, projects that the global market for clean energy technologies will quadruple to over US$226 billion in 2016&nbsp;compared to US$55 billion in 2006.&nbsp; This is a significant&nbsp;opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it stands, renewable energies such as solar are still, as the Member has noted, much more expensive than traditional fossil fuel-based energy.&nbsp; If we are to be consistent with our basic principles, we should not adopt measures which subsidise specific renewable energy types.&nbsp; And one example is the Feed-in-Tariffs that both Mr Edwin Khew and Ms Eunice Olsen&nbsp;have talked about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of&nbsp;other Members, just to elaborate, what does the Feed-in-Tariffs entail?&nbsp; It means the&nbsp;renewable energy plants are given a guaranteed contract, an off-take for the energy they produced over a substantial period of time, over 15 to 20 years, and the price, if it is to be meaningful, has to be above the market price because today, the cost of producing such energy is significantly above market price.&nbsp; The relativities, if you talk to different people,&nbsp;vary and because the price of oil is moving and&nbsp;changing, something of the order of magnitude today, compared to our&nbsp;pool price of, say, about 22 cents per kilowatt, and if you are using solar energy, you are looking at about two to three times the cost, perhaps a bit lower because oil price has gone up now.&nbsp; But that is the order of magnitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what we are effectively saying is we have to subsidise the producer of this renewable energy, say, solar, and&nbsp;that subsidy will then be smeared and passed on to all consumers of energy so that we can have solar power generation.&nbsp; That is not an optimal <p align=left>Column: 1634<p>strategy because what we are effectively doing&nbsp;is encouraging solar and the question can be asked: why solar?&nbsp; It can be bio-energy, bio-diesel, and so on.&nbsp; It can be many sources.&nbsp; It does not have to be just one.&nbsp; Then the question is: why just in the energy industry?&nbsp; Why do we not subsidise others as well?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we have to be very clear about this, and keep to our principles.&nbsp; Where&nbsp;are we allocating our resources?&nbsp; It is in R&amp;D and test-bedding, and this scenario, I think, will resonate with the Members because this is key to developing technologies that will bring down the cost of generating alternative energies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also believe that this approach will give better returns in the long run.&nbsp; If solar energy is at grid parity or very close to grid parity, there is no need to talk about Feed-in-Tariffs anymore.&nbsp; Our efforts in R&amp;D will provide an unprecedented set of opportunities for us to develop our capabilities and talent and allow us to develop technologies that can be marketed to the world.&nbsp; Our unique advantage is our compactness which provides an ideal platform for early test-bedding of such ideas in an integrated manner that larger countries cannot.&nbsp; Our consumers will also benefit as we will be able to pioneer the use of many of such solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our strong support for R&amp;D and test-bedding is evident in our recent initiatives.&nbsp; The Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council&nbsp;has allocated $170 million over the next&nbsp;five years for solar R&amp;D.&nbsp; In the area of test-bedding, EDB has also launched a $17 million Clean Energy Research and Test-bedding platform (CERT) for solar photovoltaic technologies.&nbsp; A*STAR has set up the Singapore Initiative in New Energy Technologies (SINERGY) Centre to develop alternative energy technologies.&nbsp; Just a few weeks ago, the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), which Members have observed,&nbsp;was also&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1635<p>launched. Clearly the energy sector is quite energetic in coming out with acronyms as well.&nbsp; With an expected investment of $130 million over five years, SERIS is slated to be one of the most comprehensive solar research centres in Asia and it will enable NUS and Singapore to be a world leader in solar R&amp;D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our recent efforts to grow the clean energy industry have yielded good results.&nbsp; We have heard about the success with Renewable Energy Corporation and also Nestle Oil in its second generation bio-diesel plant.&nbsp; Several other clean energy companies have also&nbsp;chosen to set up their regional headquarters here, including Solarworld, Conergy and Solar-Fabrik.&nbsp; Several companies have also chosen to set up R&amp;D centres including Bosch and Oerlikon Solar.&nbsp; And&nbsp;we will continue with our efforts to attract such companies across the entire spectrum of clean energy solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the progress on several fronts, I fully agree with Mr Edwin Khew, Ms Eunice Olsen and Mr Liang that we can do more to grow the clean energy sector, to develop more innovative solutions on energy, as well as to mitigate the risks of high oil prices and to ensure Singapore&rsquo;s energy security.&nbsp; I thank Members for their comments and suggestions in this regard.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, we need to keep an eye on the horizon in view of the ever changing international landscape. &nbsp;And given the global nature of energy issues, we have decided to set up an International Advisory Panel on Energy which I will chair.&nbsp; This panel will comprise a group of thought-leaders, eminent persons and energy experts from around the world, and will meet for the first time in November this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1636<p> The meeting of this International Advisory Panel will be held in conjunction with our first ever International Energy Week.&nbsp; The week will include a Singapore Energy Conference and other events that will allow policy makers, academics and industry players to come together to network,&nbsp;and spearhead new initiatives.&nbsp; In doing so, we will develop Singapore as a thought-leader in the region on energy issues.&nbsp; And through this process, we will constantly re-examine our policies, develop innovative approaches, and identify new opportunities for Singapore, as Members have suggested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to tourism, which is another key economic driver.&nbsp; The sector has seen strong growth.&nbsp; 2007 was&nbsp;a sterling&nbsp;year, visitor arrivals hit a record 10.3 million which is up 5.4% from the previous year and $13.8 billion in tourism receipts were generated in 2007, exceeding our target as well.&nbsp; For 2008, STB has set a target of $15.5 billion in tourism receipts, that is&nbsp;about a 12% year-on-year increase&nbsp;and 10.8 million in visitor arrivals, 5% year-on-year increase.&nbsp; We are on track to&nbsp;realising our Tourism 2015 targets of 17 million visitor arrivals and $30 billion in tourism receipts.&nbsp; And it is particularly&nbsp;encouraging that the international media has also noticed the transformation that is taking place in Singapore.&nbsp; In its October 2007 issue, the <I>F1 Racing Magazine</I> called Singapore the &ldquo;Monaco of the East&rdquo;.&nbsp; More recently, the <I>New York Times</I> published a feature article on what a visitor could do in Singapore around the clock.&nbsp; And <I>Time Magazine</I> in May last year described it as &ldquo;Singapore&rsquo;s New Look&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low has asked for an update on our plans going forward.&nbsp; Well, the agenda is quite full and we will continue with&nbsp;our efforts to position Singapore as a compelling leisure and business destination, and several major projects have been launched or announced that will enhance our tourism <p align=left>Column: 1637<p>landscape.&nbsp; These include the development of the International Cruise Terminal at Marina South, which&nbsp;should receive its guests by 2010, and the Gardens by the Bay, which will open in 2011.&nbsp; We will also develop Mandai into a nature based&nbsp;theme destination, and this is expected to be completed some time after 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we will persevere with our development efforts to ensure that our tourism industry is able to serve the increasing number of visitors.&nbsp;As many Members have observed,&nbsp;manpower development, and Ms Penny Low stressed this, is key.&nbsp; The TOurism TALent (TOTAL) Plan was launched in October last year,&nbsp;where $360 million was&nbsp;committed to train 74,000 tourism industry workers.&nbsp; And, yes,&nbsp;to date,&nbsp;we have&nbsp;about 4,300 enrolments.&nbsp; So, can we do better?&nbsp; The answer is, yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would&nbsp;urge all Members to pass the word around&nbsp;and help promote this.&nbsp; It is a growing sector with a lot of opportunities for many of our Singaporeans to take advantage of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, STB has committed $30 million to the&nbsp;Training Industry Professionals in Tourism (TIP-iT) scheme, to help industry partners invest more in training and build capabilities. As part of the tourism careers campaign, STB launched the tourism careers portal (www.tourismcareers.sg), a key one-stop information gateway for potential job seekers.&nbsp; STB will intensify outreach efforts through roadshows and career fairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;MTI and STB are working very closely with the industry players to get their feedback on how the industry, in particular, from an HR perspective, is preparing itself for the challenges for the next two years and we will be responsive to the market.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our event calendar for the next few years will see many top-tier international <p align=left>Column: 1638<p>events, the F1, and the super yachts competing in the Volvo Ocean Race will stop over in January next year.&nbsp; Singapore will also be hosting happily the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in August 2010.&nbsp; All these events will add buzz and activity to Singapore, and attract tens of thousands of visitors who will add significant value to the whole economy,&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;the high-yield tourists.&nbsp; This, we expect, will create something of the order of&nbsp;50,000-60,000 new jobs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low would&nbsp; be pleased to note that we expect our SMEs to benefit significantly from these developments.&nbsp; The benefits are across the entire value chain of the life cycle of these projects.&nbsp; From the development phase, whether it is Marina Bay Sands or Resorts World, engaging many of our local companies for the development of the infrastructure to when they move into the operational phase, many would be suppliers or outsource service providers or working closely with these operators providing certain services.&nbsp; Beyond that, the surge in visitor arrivals itself&nbsp;will benefit not only operators of local attractions, like DuckTours, Mint Museum of Toys and Singapore River Cruises, but also smaller scale boutique hotels.&nbsp; F&amp;B enclaves, like Emerald Hill and Tanglin Village, are&nbsp;increasingly attracting tourists as much as locals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increase in MICE events also gives home-grown companies, like East West Travellers and Pico Art International, a chance to garner greater exposure on the international stage&nbsp;in the MICE industry.&nbsp; Social enterprises, a pet project&nbsp;of Ms Low, too have benefited.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will just give one example.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is The Singapore Shawl, a social enterprise that provides employment for retrenched women, especially&nbsp;those who were&nbsp;hit by the 2003 economic downturn.&nbsp; The shawls have hand-made motifs that reflect life in the Garden City, from the flora and fauna <p align=left>Column: 1639<p>to our local cultures.&nbsp; These shawls are regularly presented to foreign dignitaries and visitors to Singapore.&nbsp; So there are spin-offs in all sectors for the SMEs as well as the social sector.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo Ser Luck has asked about the anticipated visitorship for the F1 race&nbsp;and what kind of participation&nbsp;we can expect from the locals.&nbsp; F1 ticket sales have been&nbsp; brisk across all tiers of pricing.&nbsp; The bulk of these tickets have already been sold.&nbsp; It is quite remarkable considering the race is still six to seven months away.&nbsp; The race organisers are also planning to make more tickets available,&nbsp;and they will be&nbsp;in the pipeline soon.&nbsp; All in all, we are expecting well over 80,000 spectators for the event.&nbsp; Overseas demand for the event has been very strong, and we expect tourists to make up at least 30-40% of all ticket holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Teo has also asked about the overall economic&nbsp;value of&nbsp;this project.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we embarked on this, we expect tourism receipts conservatively to be boosted by about $100 million a year.&nbsp; That is the quantifiable component.&nbsp; But as we have stressed many times, first, on the quantifiable aspects of this project itself, because it is the first of its kind for Singapore,&nbsp; we really need to have the experience of year one before we can pin down the numbers in a more definitive manner.&nbsp; But we share his optimism that the numbers are likely to be positive.&nbsp; At the same time, there are many intangible spin-offs and benefits that will percolate across the entire economy&nbsp;&ndash; whether it is benefit to our SMEs and other companies that we have already talked about, or in terms of the branding and positioning for Singapore and also for our wealth management industry, eg, the opportunity to create new entertainment and networking events built around the Formula&nbsp;1 for their high network clients.&nbsp; So there is a wide range of quantifiable <p align=left>Column: 1640<p>and non-quantifiable benefits.&nbsp; And our assessment is, overall, this should be a positive venture for Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The race aside, STB is working closely with partner agencies, industry stakeholders and community organisations on a calendar of events around the race period.&nbsp; These include the inaugural Singapore River Festival, the Singapore Biennale and the Singapore Motorshow.&nbsp; The events also extend to the heartlands, the Go-Karting, and so on.&nbsp; In all, we expect this to be a successful event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On R&amp;D, my Minister has already&nbsp;outlined our efforts to develop a knowledge-based economy.&nbsp; The A*STAR and the S&amp;T2010 plan have focused on fostering world-class scientific research and nurturing R&amp;D talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked about our efforts to groom local research talent.&nbsp;&nbsp; A*STAR has been investing in building local talent since 2001 through the National Science Scholarships&nbsp; and A*STAR Graduate Scholarships.&nbsp; Through these scholarship programmes, we hand pick the best local talent, and groom them to become future scientific leaders for Singapore.&nbsp; To date, we have over 700 scholars in the pipeline, who are studying at leading universities around the world.&nbsp; And our goal, as the Minister has said,&nbsp;is to train 1,000 by the year&nbsp;2015.&nbsp; These scholars will also, beyond their PhD degrees, be having attachments to some of the top&nbsp;research scientists from around the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low&nbsp;has also asked whether we have&nbsp;been sufficiently proactive in cultivating local talents.&nbsp; I want to inform the House that more than 85% of the A*STAR scholarships awarded are to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Non-Singaporeans who take up A*STAR scholarships are also expected to take up citizenship during the course of their studies.&nbsp; I would like to assure Members of the House that <p align=left>Column: 1641<p>bringing in foreign research talent is an integral part of nurturing and developing our own local pool of talent, and hence these should be viewed as complementary and not conflicting strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, to harness the economic value of our R&amp;D investments, commercialisation will be a key focus for A*STAR to make our research dollars count.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do this&nbsp;by strengthening the links with industry and by bringing technologies that are developed through R&amp;D to the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong linkages between research institutes and industry clusters will ensure that the discoveries in our laboratories are relevant to the needs of industry.&nbsp; From April to December last year,&nbsp;the Biomedical Research Council&nbsp;and Science and Engineering Research Council&nbsp;(SERC) initiated 171 new R&amp;D collaborations with industries&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;notably, the SERC Aerospace programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low and Miss Penny Low&nbsp;have asked if our local businesses benefit from our R&amp;D strategies.&nbsp; There are many examples of SMEs who have benefited from the \"Growing Enterprises with Technology Upgrade\", the&nbsp;GET-Up scheme, and I can elaborate on that if they want later.&nbsp; But let me just stress that, in particular,&nbsp;&nbsp;166 A*STAR researchers have joined the ranks of 116 SMEs to help jump-start and strengthen their in-house R&amp;D capabilities.&nbsp; This flow of talent from the institutes to the SMEs remains one of the most practical forms of assistance that SMEs can benefit from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A*STAR is also committed to bringing technologies to market. There are many&nbsp;examples of these.&nbsp; But we should not measure the value of the research that is done in A*STAR purely by the value of the divestments or the spin-offs.&nbsp; As I have elaborated, it is a manpower issue, it is the benefits that accrue across the entire economy, and we should look at <p align=left>Column: 1642<p>the entire spectrum in forming a judgment on an endeavour which is long term in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude by saying that to further strengthen Exploit's efforts in bringing Intellectual Property (IP), we will launch a new programme called Exploit-IP, which will promote international IP partnerships to benefit Singapore businesses&nbsp;&ndash; Miss Penny Low's point about collaborative R&amp;D.&nbsp; And Exploit Technologies will also be launching&nbsp;the Technology Transfer Network this year.&nbsp; The Network will bring together Exploit and the Institutes of Higher Learning&nbsp;to facilitate the transfer of IP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of KPIs, let me just say that our R&amp;D expenditure as a percentage of GDP has gone up from 1.9% to 2.4%.&nbsp; The number of research scientists and engineers per 10,000 of our labour force has increased from 66 in 2000 to 87 in 2006.&nbsp; And in terms of patents,&nbsp;between 2000 and 2006, patent applications increased by two-and-a-half times to 2036 in 2006.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me conclude by saying that I think our R&amp;D strategy as well as our policies on tourism and energy continue to be robust and position Singapore well for the future.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

SPRING has realigned its focus to become the agency championing SMEs.&nbsp; It gave up quite a bit of its old functions, including the divestment of PSB to focus on SMEs.&nbsp; The CEO and his management team have done well in helping to strengthen and grow the SME sector.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Chairman of SPRING, Mr Philip Yeo, is now finally passionately focusing on SME development.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 1643<p>Government has finally listened to years of calls from Members and the private sector to set up an&nbsp; SME champion agency, and that is SPRING.&nbsp; And also due to the work done by the Action Committee for Entrepreneurship (ACE) together with the various MTI agencies, like SPRING and IE, financing is no longer the number one concern among SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made very good progress but a few areas of financing gaps still exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dotcom bust of 2000, many of the private equity players decided to focus largely on the late-stage companies, leaving very little money available to fund innovative companies at the very early stages.&nbsp; On the other hand, many growth companies have stretched their balance sheets and cannot borrow any money, and they are too small for any public listing.&nbsp; So we have viable companies that have problems in terms of short-term financing.&nbsp; There is therefore a clear market failure in these two areas.&nbsp; I feel that the Government can provide equity funding for growth companies with good potential for Government making modest returns, and not losses in these investments.&nbsp; I hope that the Government can also help develop the early stage VC industry focused on investing in Singapore's start-ups capable of growing rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the tax incentives under the Enterprise Investment Incentive Scheme, while well intended, the scheme, I believe, has not been effective in achieving the objectives in encouraging angel investors to invest in start-up for two reasons.&nbsp; First, it is quite onerous to qualify for this incentive and, second, this is applicable to investments into qualifying companies that failed, with losses recognisable in the&nbsp;2nd to the 6th year after investment is made.&nbsp; I believe it would be better for the Government to allow tax deductibility for investments into start-ups when the <p align=left>Column: 1644<p>investments are made and not when the companies fail.&nbsp; I feel that the scheme should be changed from the current negative approach focusing on failures as a pre-requisite for tax write-offs to one of giving the write-offs at the time of investments being made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the intention of the Government to promote innovation and R&amp;D in local enterprises, especially among SMEs, is a right one and will benefit the economy in the long term.&nbsp; I, however, have a concern with respect to the execution of disbursing the incentives announced.&nbsp; Many past Government schemes benefited the larger companies since the officers implementing these schemes found it easier to work with bigger companies to achieve their objectives in disbursing the incentives.&nbsp; For example, with the SDF, I know that in the past, larger companies, including MNCs and GLCs, benefited more than SMEs.&nbsp; MTI therefore needs to ensure that the KPIs of the Government agencies administering the SDF and R&amp;D schemes should be pegged to number of companies reached, including as many SMEs as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the area of internationalisation, increasingly many companies are looking to internationalise at a very early stage of their development.&nbsp; IE Singapore, however, has traditionally focused on larger and more established companies.&nbsp; We should make IE Singapore more accessible to our SMEs and start-ups.&nbsp; Otherwise, SPRING may have to add&nbsp;an additional role to support the internationalisation efforts of our smaller companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on commercialisation of R&amp;D, we heard Minister of State Iswaran speak about the initiatives, including the initiatives by Exploit.&nbsp; We have many research&nbsp;outputs available done by our universities and our&nbsp;research institutes&nbsp;that are still sitting on the shelf for want of a proper commercialisation plan, or <p align=left>Column: 1645<p>finding a suitable partner.&nbsp; I think we have attempted to license and sell these outputs many times, but I believe that the approach taken is wrong.&nbsp; The approach taken is one of trying to derive maximum value at the time of divesting some of this research.&nbsp; I would suggest that we do not focus on economic gains, but on trying to get as much research outputs as possible out to industry.&nbsp; And I think the end result will be beneficial and the gains will come in the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also like to suggest that we allow researchers to work directly with industry than to go through an organisation like Exploit and become a bottleneck, and this will, in fact, be a bigger problem in trying to commercialise the research.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other solution that we can look at is the example in the US of the Small Business Technology Transfer Programme.&nbsp; It has been very effective.&nbsp; I think we can implement such a scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the whole, I think we have done a good job in supporting SMEs and entrepreneurship promotion, and I would like to congratulate MTI for that.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There can be tie-ups between SPRING, MOE and other institutions to sharpen the business acumen of our younger Singaporeans.&nbsp; Industrial attachment programmes that polytechnics have been doing can be replicated in JCs.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Consumer Protection</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</B> Sir, last&nbsp;year in this House, we&nbsp;were glad that MTI had considered favourably&nbsp;the recommendations put up by the task force set up to review the&nbsp;Consumer Protection&nbsp;Fair Trading&nbsp;Act (CPFTA).&nbsp; Now I hope the Minister could further strengthen the CPFTA for better consumer protection.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I would like to request that the Minister introduce new regulations under the CPFTA to make motor vehicle dealers&nbsp;more&nbsp;transparent&nbsp;in their&nbsp;deposit policies.&nbsp; The number of complaints received by the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) against the motorcar industry is increasing.&nbsp; In 2005, it was about 1,227 but, in 2007, it was raised to 1,707 cases.&nbsp; One of the issues is the forfeiture of the deposits by vendors when the contract fell through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, CPFTA should include regulations to govern how unsolicited goods and goods provided on an opt-out basis should&nbsp;be treated, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, according to CASE's records, the number of complaints against timeshare industry is the highest among all.&nbsp; In year 2007, we received 2,456 <p align=left>Column: 1648<p>cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are not prepared to introduce&nbsp;specific timeshare legislation to regulate the industry,&nbsp;the CPFTA should be amended to further regulate sale of timeshare schemes in Singapore.&nbsp;This should also apply to businesses which provide leasing, advertising and/or consultancy services to terminate, cancel, sell, transfer, purchase, lease, rent and/or recover of any monies paid under any existing&nbsp;timeshare contract or agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current three days cooling-off period provided is also too short.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope MTI could strengthen the CPFTA&nbsp;to increase the cooling-off period of timeshare contract and that such cooling-off period also applies to businesses offering reselling, terminating or upgrading of timeshare membership.&nbsp; In addition, the claim&nbsp;limit&nbsp;under the&nbsp;CPFTA should be raised from&nbsp;$20,000 to $30,000 so that more timeshare contracts could be covered.&nbsp; We also hope that the time bar on specified bodies action under the CPFTA be extended beyond the one-year period to give the specified bodies, like&nbsp;STB, and CASE, more time to deal with cases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many consumers are also complaining that they are given \"lemons\" when they buy products.&nbsp; What they mean is that they were&nbsp;given&nbsp;products with problems by default.&nbsp; Since there is no legislation spelling out consumers' right to pursue for refund or replacement, businesses are dragging their feet in assisting consumers&nbsp;with such problems.&nbsp; We find this unacceptable and would like the Minister to consider introducing a lemon law or provisions in any of our existing consumer laws to cover this aspect for any consumer transactions.&nbsp; I suggest a joint task force be formed to take a closer look at the experiences of other countries that have&nbsp;implemented such a law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the recent outcry about&nbsp;tainted toys being sold to children, we feel that <p align=left>Column: 1649<p>there is also a need to ensure that toys, or for that matter any products, that retailers bring into Singapore must meet&nbsp;certain safety standards.&nbsp; We need to put in place a product liability law to put the onus&nbsp;on the retailers or the manufacturers to ensure product safety before they place their products for sale in Singapore.&nbsp; This&nbsp;will give consumers the right to pursue for refund or replacement speedily at a lower cost.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Consumer Protection&nbsp;&ndash; Fair Trading Act</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, let me first declare my interest&nbsp;on this topic. I am&nbsp;the Vice-President of the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, MTI informed members of this Committee that they had agreed to all the eight&nbsp;recommendations of the Task Force Review Committee regarding the proposed amendments to the Consumer Protection Fair Trading Act, or CPFTA, for short. MTI had also held a public consultation exercise in September last year to invite public feedback on the proposed amendments to the Act.&nbsp; Four sets of subsidiary legislation were also proposed.&nbsp; May I ask MTI for an update on the progress of the revision to the law.&nbsp; Would MTI be able to provide an indication as to the timeline before the CPFTA would be amended and the subsidiary regulations introduced?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I also seek a confirmation from MTI that the financial sector would also be included in this revised CPFTA. It is critical that we provide an avenue for consumers to seek recourse against&nbsp;rogue agents or companies who engage in unfair practice in selling their financial products, especially to the illiterate or&nbsp;elderly who may not be aware of the risks involved in making such a purchase.&nbsp;We also call on MTI to designate the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)&nbsp;to be the specified body to monitor these businesses in the <p align=left>Column: 1650<p>financial sector.&nbsp; Clearly, MAS would have more clout with them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, complaints against car dealers for making unfair forfeitures of car purchase deposits have risen over the past two years.&nbsp; The proposed Motor Vehicle Dealer Deposits Regulations require these car dealers to be more transparent about their deposit refund policy.&nbsp; May I ask MTI to consider imposing a penalty on car dealers who delay in refunding deposits paid by consumers?&nbsp;&nbsp;This will discourage car dealers from taking their time to refund&nbsp;deposits paid for by consumers who will need the funds for payment to another car dealer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Mr Yeo before me, I also wish to ask MTI whether they would agree to the proposal by CASE to increase the prescribed limit under the&nbsp;CPFTA from $20,000 to $30,000.&nbsp; The reason for the proposal is really to allow more consumers to bring forth claims under the CPFTA where they have entered into a transaction&nbsp;involving unfair practice by a retailer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, if I may speak about&nbsp;the review of a \"specified body\" under the CPFTA.&nbsp; Currently, CASE and the Singapore Tourism Board are the only&nbsp;two specified bodies under the CPFTA.&nbsp; We are operating almost like the Fair Trading Office in other countries with similar consumer protection legislation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, whilst exercising the duties and obligations as a specified body, CASE has incurred a disproportionate amount of costs trying to bring errant businesses to the negotiation table to persuade these businesses to sign a Voluntary Compliance Agreement, or a VCA.&nbsp;Basically, the VCA is to persuade the businesses not to engage in unfair practices or to breach the CPFTA.&nbsp; Where the errant businesses fail or refuse to sign the VCA,&nbsp;then CASE will have no choice but to <p align=left>Column: 1651<p>apply to the Injunction Proposal Review Panel, under the CPFTA, for approval to commence injunction proceedings against the business.&nbsp;The application for an injunction is not taken lightly and only as a last resort because of this need to protect unsuspecting consumers from being taken advantage of.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Sir, the legal cost of the injunction application is prohibitive and there is no guarantee that&nbsp;CASE would be able to recover such cost from the business&nbsp;if the business eventually&nbsp;becomes insolvent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CASE would like to seek an amendment to the CPFTA&nbsp;to ask that the role of the specified body stops after making a successful&nbsp;application to the Injunction Proposal Review Panel.&nbsp; This&nbsp;Panel is currently chaired by&nbsp;an ex-High Court judge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Review&nbsp;Panel has approved the application, then the Attorney-General Chambers can be directed to take out the injunction proceedings against the recalcitrant business instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this proposal, the onus&nbsp;and cost of prosecution&nbsp;will rest with the State instead of on&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-profit organisation, like CASE, which is limited by financial means to carry out prosecution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our estimate is that it has cost CASE more than $180,000 to date for three injunction applications, none of which has been concluded pending a Court decision.&nbsp; So the costs may continue to go up and we really do not know whether we can recover such costs from the errant business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I urge MTI to consider our proposal to amend the CPFTA for the specified body's role to stop after the&nbsp;successful application to the Review Panel.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Let me assure Members that we share the same sentiments on the importance of the&nbsp;SME sector. MTI is committed to create the most conducive environment for our start-ups and SMEs to thrive.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SME sector is a critical component of our economy.&nbsp; For the past three years,&nbsp;its value-add growth at 11% year-on-year has outpaced the overall GDP growth of 7.7%. &nbsp;In the past three years alone (2004-2007), the SME sector created an additional 330,000 jobs and accounted for 63% of the&nbsp;net employment creation. They were instrumental in reducing our unemployment rate to an all-time low of 2.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a group, the top 500 SMEs had combined profits of more than $665 million dollars last year, compared to only&nbsp;$70 million in 1999.&nbsp; By their sheer entrepreneurship and resourcefulness, our SMEs have grown to be larger, more sophisticated and internationally competitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Members' enquiries,&nbsp;let me elaborate on the Government's&nbsp;framework in supporting our SMEs. There are four pillars:&nbsp;&nbsp;namely, financing, manpower, markets and capacity building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guiding principle in the area of financing has been for the Government to catalyse the private sector to create more financial products customised to meet the needs of SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with financial institutions, in 2007, SPRING Singapore made available 3,000 loans amounting to $700 million through the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) and the Loan <p align=left>Column: 1653<p>Insurance Scheme (LIS).&nbsp;&nbsp;With further enhancement and lowered premium rates (from 2% to 1.5%), the LIS is expected to catalyse a projected total of $3 billion of private sector loans over the next four years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has contributed greatly through his efforts in the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE).&nbsp;&nbsp;As shown in a SME development survey, obtaining financing is no longer a top concern for SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;We thank Mr Inderjit Singh for his excellent leadership in identifying and plugging financial gaps in our system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo on the importance of manpower development in growing our SMEs. SMEs need capable professionals and strong leaders to succeed.&nbsp; However, with many of our best young talents opting for well-paying careers with&nbsp;multinationals, it is not easy for SMEs to attract and retain good talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this, SPRING has put together a $60 million Business Leaders Initiative (BLI) to nurture current and future business leaders for SMEs.&nbsp; This BLI caters to talent development at three levels: SME leadership, middle managers and young executives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the apex, the Advanced Management Programme (AMP) focuses on the training of CEOs and senior leadership. The Management Development Scholarship (MDS) targets middle management.&nbsp; Soon, SPRING will launch the Executive Development Scholarship (EDS), an undergraduate scholarship targeted at promising students.&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, BLI hopes to train 1,000 CEOs and Senior Managers&nbsp; by 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho may be pleased to know that SPRING and Workforce Development Agency (WDA) will also be rolling out the HR Capability Development Programme <p align=left>Column: 1654<p>for SMEs this year.&nbsp; The programme will help SMEs implement good HR systems, practices and procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To grow, SMEs cannot rely solely on our domestic markets but&nbsp;must venture abroad.&nbsp; In recent years, we have seen many SMEs making successful forays into overseas markets. &nbsp;A recent survey&nbsp; also shows that 70% of our SMEs derived part of their sales revenue from overseas markets. &nbsp;That our SMEs are internationally oriented is an encouraging sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that their business models are potentially scalable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Singh that IE Singapore plays an active role in assisting SMEs by organising missions, fairs and networking platforms for them to build connections.&nbsp; The&nbsp;International Marketing Activities Programme (IMAP)&nbsp;&nbsp;supports activities organised by trade associations and chambers to help&nbsp;their members&nbsp;market their products and services overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, of the 40,000 companies that made use of IE Singapore's&nbsp;services in 2007, 80% were SMEs.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Minister had earlier spoken on how SME associations were being held at the industry level through the Local Enterprise Association Development (LEAD)&nbsp;programme.&nbsp; At the company level, our agencies have developed many capacity building programmes to cater to the needs of SMEs at different growth stages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of branding and marketing, IE Singapore&nbsp;and SPRING have a joint programme called \"BrandPact\". One beneficiary of BrandPact is a company called&nbsp;bYSI.&nbsp; bYSI started its first retail outlet in Tiong Bahru in 1998 selling women's clothes.&nbsp; With BrandPact in 2005, bYSI was able to re-define its market niche by focusing on the fashion needs of career women.&nbsp; Its sales have <p align=left>Column: 1655<p>been growing at 30% since.&nbsp; The company currently operates 10 outlets overseas, and is looking to expand further into the Middle East.&nbsp; In December last year, the company won the \"Singapore Prestigious Brand Award\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist SMEs in developing new capabilities in product development and process innovation, SPRING launched the Capability Development Programme (CDP) in four sectors:&nbsp; marine, logistic, F&amp;B and medical devices.&nbsp; The $5 million MedTech capability development programme, for instance,&nbsp;enables local precision engineering SMEs to develop new process know-how to supply to the medical device industry.&nbsp; The participating SMEs hope to generate $300 million&nbsp;of new sales from the medical devices industry over the next three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we have invested so much on upgrading capabilities, and will continue to do so, is to increase SMEs' capacity for value creation. &nbsp;This is more effective in the long run, than providing temporary band-aid solutions to help SMEs cope with the rising business costs, as Ms Jessica Tan reminded us.&nbsp; We should not create artificial conditions that insulate our SMEs from global competition. The responsible strategy for us has to be to continue investments to upgrade our SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zaqy Mohamad pointed out that we would need to nurture innovative enterprises to create both quality GDP growth and high-value jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; I agree with him.&nbsp; Innovative enterprises and knowledge industries are our future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To nurture innovative enterprises, we adopt a three-pronged strategy.&nbsp; The first prong is to encourage greater R&amp;D and innovation by existing enterprises.&nbsp; The newly launched \"R&amp;D Incentive for Start-<p align=left>Column: 1656<p>up Enterprise\" (RISE) announced by the Minister for Finance is designed for that.&nbsp; Mr Teo Ser Luck questioned if SMEs would benefit from RISE because they tend not to invest much in R&amp;D.&nbsp; Our latest SME development survey shows that a significant 14% of all startups spent between $100,000-$300,000 on R&amp;D in 2007. We certainly hope that, over time, more SMEs will invest more in R&amp;D and make full use of RISE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a view that R&amp;D and innovation are only applicable to high-tech industries.&nbsp; This is not necessarily always the case.&nbsp; More World System Pte Ltd, better known to Singaporeans as the Waraku chain of restaurants, is the first in Asia to leverage on R&amp;D to develop pasta that cooks in a mere 15 seconds, as compared to 10 minutes.&nbsp; As a result, this has cut down the waiting time for customers significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with Mr Teo and Mr Singh that SMEs and startups should have access to various programmes aimed at promoting company-level innovation and R&amp;D.&nbsp; In fact, we share the belief that SMEs and startups are amongst the best places for the new innovations to sprout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spread the benefits of R&amp;D findings of our Research Institutes, the Technology Innovation Programme (TIP) has seconded 31 A*STAR researchers to SMEs.&nbsp; To encourage SMEs to undertake outsourced R&amp;D, SPRING has established Centres of Innovation (COIs) in four sectors, including Food and Precision Engineering to provide technology consultancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh commented that in commercialising our RIs' research findings, the relevant departments should not have profit-maximisation as their goal.&nbsp; We agree.&nbsp; In the case of Exploit Technologies, we want to assure Mr Singh that its goal is to make A*STAR's technologies as widely accessible to the industry as possible.&nbsp; This is in line with <p align=left>Column: 1657<p>the objective to derive economic benefits from our R&amp;D investments.&nbsp; The issue though is not of licensing fees being unrealistically high.&nbsp; The main qualm for many SMEs has been their wanting to have full IP&nbsp;right or exclusive licensing in return for their partial cost-sharing.&nbsp; As such, A*STAR finds it difficult to accede to such requests as it would like to proliferate its technologies to as many enterprises as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second prong to grow innovative enterprises is to create a broad entrepreneurship community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mdm Ho Geok Choo that the entrepreneurial ethos needs to be cultivated from young.&nbsp; Starting in schools, we need to infuse students with an entrepreneurial zeal.&nbsp; SPRING&rsquo;s Entrepreneurship Talent Development Fund (ETDF) provides monetary support to young budding entrepreneurs in our universities and polytechnics to start their ventures.&nbsp; To date,&nbsp;this fund has invested $1.4 million&nbsp;in 44 student startups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting entrepreneurship cannot be the Government's responsibility alone.&nbsp; Our entire society must embrace the values of self reliance, resourcefulness and tenacity.&nbsp; For entrepreneurship to take root, our people must learn to take risks, think out of the box and tolerate failures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realising this, the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) has sought to build a community of people passionate in and committed to entrepreneurship development.&nbsp; ACE reaches out to a wide sector of the business circle, including entrepreneurs, financiers, lawyers, consultants and educationists.&nbsp; Through the ACE Speakers' Circuit, for instance, successful entrepreneurs share their experiences to inspire students and youths on entrepreneurship.&nbsp; So far, more than 150 Speakers' Circuit sessions have been held, reaching out to about 30,000 students and teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1658<p>Finally, the third prong is to grow innovative startups.&nbsp; Today, we are happy to see many of our SMEs, such as Hyflux, OSIM, Inter-Roller and Breadtalk, establishing themselves regionally&nbsp;and internationally.&nbsp; These companies were once small.&nbsp; But because they are resourceful and innovative, they get to where they are today.&nbsp; New startups are important to us for they may be just a startup today,&nbsp;and could well become a Starbucks, Facebook, Google or YouTube tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thank Mr Singh for his suggestion of looking into financing for growth-stage enterprises. I would, however, add that the Government is also mindful not to intervene in the market unless there is a clear market failure.&nbsp; It is our belief that direct investments into companies are best left to the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh has also pointed out the gap which innovative companies in Singapore face: between taking an idea from concept to commercialisation.&nbsp; He also cited the apparent success of the Small Business Innovation Research (or SBIR) programme in USA in commercialising new technologies.&nbsp; We will study his suggestions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Still on the subject of helping startups in R&amp;D, SPRING intends to support the establishment of&nbsp; \"full service\" incubators in our RIs and the private sector.&nbsp; These incubators could provide startups with a one-stop service for mentorship, business connections, technology matching services, capital and access to other resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to the topic of consumer protection.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Lim Biow Chuan both touched on the CPFTA.&nbsp; Sir, allow me to provide an update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPFTA was reviewed in late 2006 by a taskforce led by CASE and <p align=left>Column: 1659<p>MTI.&nbsp; The taskforce submitted various recommendations, which my Ministry had accepted.&nbsp; We conducted a public consultation in October last year and are now finalising our proposals, taking into account the feedback received.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will elaborate on some of the main proposals under consideration.&nbsp; First, financial services, such as banking and insurance, are currently excluded from the CPFTA.&nbsp; We are working to remove this exclusion, which would give consumers the option of seeking redress through the CPFTA.&nbsp; Consumers will also benefit from additional protection in areas, such as undue pressure on consumers during sale, which are currently not covered by the financial services-related legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, businesses sometimes send goods or provide services to consumers without their prior consent, and subsequently demand payment from them,&nbsp;or goods or services may also be provided on a free trial basis, placing a burden on consumers to opt out from the arrangement.&nbsp; We will introduce new regulations to allow consumers to treat all unsolicited goods and services as unconditional free gifts from the businesses, unless the consumer has acknowledged in writing his willingness to accept and pay for them.&nbsp; For goods and services provided on a free trial basis, the regulations will require businesses to remind consumers that the trial period is ending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, motor vehicle dealers often package the purchase and financing of the vehicle together, and then collect a deposit from the consumer.&nbsp; There has been feedback that some dealers have been confiscating the deposits, citing a failed loan application as the reason, but without showing any proof.&nbsp; We will introduce new regulations to require dealers to disclose their deposit policies <p align=left>Column: 1660<p>clearly in their sales contracts, so that consumers can make informed decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, specified bodies, namely CASE and STB, can take various actions against errant businesses to court.&nbsp; Currently, the specified bodies have to do so within a timeframe of one year.&nbsp; In light of experience gained, we will extend the timeframe to provide them with sufficient time to perform their due diligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, the CPFTA's prescribed limit is currently set at $20,000.&nbsp; We will increase this to $30,000 to take into account larger consumer transactions over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will enhance the level of consumer protection provided by the CPFTA, strengthen CASE's efforts and, ultimately, improve consumers' welfare.&nbsp; We intend to make the necessary legislative changes this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI shares CASE's concern over the number of complaints against the timeshare industry.&nbsp; We will therefore strengthen the CPFTA's regulation of timeshare products.&nbsp; The CPFTA currently allows consumers to cancel their timeshare contracts within a three-day cooling period. We intend to extend this to five days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to caution against rushing to regulate any industry that shows its first sign of consumer disputes.&nbsp; First, legislation adds to compliance cost; and over-legislation can also stifle new and innovative business formation. &nbsp;Second, the principle of \"caveat emptor\" or \"buyers beware\" remains the cornerstone of the consumer protection framework in Singapore.&nbsp; For it is in exercising their judgment, including rejecting shoddy goods, that our consumers could develop a sharp instinct in differentiating quality offerings and&nbsp;bogus claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1661<p>Let me now move to other consumer issues.&nbsp; Products with latent defects are known colloquially as \"lemons\".&nbsp; Consumers today already enjoy a certain level of protection against such goods, as they can reject these products and seek damages.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we welcome Mr Yeo's suggestion to jointly study the feasibility of a lemon law in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumer protection is not just about mandating rules.&nbsp; We must take a balanced approach that seeks to safeguard the interests of consumers without imposing an onerous regulatory burden on the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of Government prescribing standards all the time, we will encourage industry-accreditation and self-regulation to the highest standard possible.&nbsp; We will also continue to work with CASE on the best ways to educate consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to summarise in Mandarin.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>): [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to</I> &nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080303/20080303VS_102032.pdf\"\"><I>Appendix A</I></a> <I>*.</I>] Sir, the SME sector is an important pillar of our economy. For the past three years, the value-add growth of 160,000 SMEs has outpaced the overall GDP growth of 7.7%. At the same time, it has created an additional 330,000 new jobs.&nbsp; To create a pro-business environment to nurture the SMEs, the Government will continue to improve the operating environment of SMEs, and cut down the unnecessary red tape. To assist SMEs to raise their competitiveness, MTI will invest in the four pillars, namely, financing, manpower training, capacity building and helping SMEs internationalise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our economic outlook and overall competitiveness does not rely on the number of MNCs, but rather it depends on the SME sector which accounted for 99% of the corporate sector, and whether these SMEs can successfully transform <p align=left>Column: 1662<p>their business model, that is, to step out of conservative and low efficiency models, and shift towards knowledge-based industries. This shift in business model is critical to our future economic development and it is a major concern for the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, our Government has urged SMEs to do their best to learn, absorb new knowledge and be innovative. SMEs should build up their core competencies and develop unique operating models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope that the small enterprises will spring up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and bigger enterprises will grow and flourish, and that we will have a vibrant and prosperous SME sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, if we can focus on developing long term capabilities of our SMEs, with unyielding determination, hard work, innovation and continue to strive for excellence, our SMEs will be able to overcome the short-term difficulties and move towards a brighter future.</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We had a dialogue session with our resource panel and industry experts who had raised this as a very major issue.&nbsp; Although the quotas have been released,&nbsp;they cannot get it from the traditional sources, and had asked for diversification of their sources of labour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second problem that they highlighted was the IR.&nbsp; To staff the IRs, companies have been poaching from our local hotels, which is creating a vacuum.&nbsp; So we are going to create a vacuum somewhere, if we do not suddenly bring in a whole source of workers from outside and, specifically, the issue of the <p align=left>Column: 1663<p>Philippines not being a qualified source for workers working in the IR.&nbsp;

On the whole, we do realise that, with the economy growing so strongly, manpower is one of the key constraints holding back further growth.&nbsp; We have been working very closely with the Ministry of Manpower and, to their credit, they have relaxed the quotas, they have expanded S-Passes and, as I have explained in my speech, we look at each cluster and we try to tackle the manpower needs of each cluster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, take the example of the IRs.&nbsp; We do recognise that, with the two IRs and the many plans that we have in place for tourism, we are generating some 60,000 jobs over the next few years.&nbsp; When we see this in the context of the 180,000 jobs in the tourism sector, we are talking about a 30% increase&nbsp;over two to three years.&nbsp; So we have been working with all the stakeholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not describe it as poaching, but there will have to be some reshuffling of the manpower assets.&nbsp; We cannot have all the new employees in the IRs just coming from new sources.&nbsp; So they will be employing some of the people from existing hotels, and existing hotels, for example, would have to have recruit new people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Minister&nbsp;of State&nbsp;Iswaran explained just now, we have, in fact, been working very closely with the stakeholders to put in place a very comprehensive plan covering all the vocations needed.&nbsp; We have worked down to great details what are the vocations.&nbsp; Members might be interested to know that the biggest challenge is really animal trainers because, with the IRs, and especially Resort World with seaworld and marine world, they are <p align=left>Column: 1664<p>looking for animal trainers, and the only people today employed as animal trainers are really at our zoo.&nbsp; So we have to work with all the various entities to make sure that, for every vocation, we train the people ahead of time.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Sir, as Minister of State&nbsp;Iswaran explained, R&amp;D is a very long-term effort and we need to harness all available talent, both overseas and Singaporeans.&nbsp; We cannot embark on a R&amp;D strategy that is anchored on Singaporean talent alone.&nbsp; If we do so, I think we are shortchanging ourselves.&nbsp; If you visit any R&amp;D institution anywhere in the world, and you go to any of these research laboratories, the first thing that strikes you is the number of nationalities that the researchers come from.&nbsp; So we will be shortchanging ourselves if we just concentrate on Singaporeans and we do not draw in foreign talents.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our intention is that, out of the whole R&amp;D pool that we have, 50% will be Singaporeans and, out of the Singaporean pool, half of them would be PhD-qualified.&nbsp; We are using that framework and we are providing the scholarships and the opportunities.&nbsp; As Mr Iswaran said, the <p align=left>Column: 1665<p>scholarships that we offer, we encourage the people who take them up to take up Singapore citizenship before they come back and work.&nbsp; So, eventually, all those who take up our scholarships, when they sign the bond, they will be Singapore citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole research effort covers the whole spectrum.&nbsp; We have previously been very successful at research working with the companies, what we call the mission-oriented research, related to the industry.&nbsp; We realise that, going forward, we need to build up a stronger basic science base, both in our universities as well as in our research institutions.&nbsp; At the same time, we also need to cover the other end of the spectrum, which is the applications research that will benefit our SMEs.&nbsp; So, if you look&nbsp;at our whole research strategy, we have been quite successful and quite good in the middle area working with the big companies, both MNCs as well as the local big companies in mission-oriented research where we give them research grants, we work and collaborate jointly.&nbsp; In fact, we set up a research institute for each one of the strategic cluster that&nbsp;we have in Singapore.&nbsp; And this has been a very successful strategy.&nbsp; But going forward, we need to go upstream into our universities and to basic sciences, and we need to go downstream into our polytechnics, into providing researchers to our industries, first to the industry associations as well as to the companies.&nbsp; And I think the answers that Mr Iswaran has given cover all these areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have a fairly comprehensive research strategy.&nbsp; The results will only show itself, I am afraid, over the medium and long term.&nbsp; But this requires us to maintain this very sustained effort and to build up our resources from bottom-up.&nbsp; In the meantime, if we do not attract foreign talent, the so-called whales, I think we will be taking a far longer time to reach the end stage that we want.&nbsp; So by <p align=left>Column: 1666<p>incorporating foreign talent, we shorten the time for us to build up the capability and, we hope, as Mr Low Thia Khiang described it, the guppies that we nurture will eventually also become world-class renowned scientists.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

First of all, it is a competitive sector.&nbsp; The Government does not interfere with the price-setting.&nbsp; We believe there is enough competitive pressure among the key players.&nbsp; We encourage the posting of prices and discounts so that motorists know what they are paying before they enter the petrol kiosks.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, we have been tracking the petrol prices.&nbsp; They have gone up as oil prices go up, and they have come down, albeit with a bit of a lag, when oil prices come down.&nbsp; So I believe the petrol sector reflects the competition that is already existing there.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it is possible to sustain a market for solar power, may I just ask whether MTI is doing enough to create that market?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; We can see that tax credits and rebates are used in so many instances, eg, green cars, which will be quite expensive <p align=left>Column: 1667<p>without rebates.&nbsp; This means that the use of tax credits and rebates is clearly a reflection of priorities.&nbsp; So may I ask why subsidising the use of&nbsp;renewable&nbsp;energy is not so important for MTI for now?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Iswaran:</B> Sir, I thank Ms Olsen for the clarification sought.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTI is really not in the business of trying to create a market for solar power.&nbsp; We look at it as we create economic activity and invite more investments and economic activities to Singapore, and the demand for energy is a consequence of that effort.&nbsp; We then seek to meet that demand by diversifying our sources and making sure that we have adequate supply.&nbsp; So solar energy is really just one part of that.&nbsp; Today, as you have already heard, a significant portion of our energy needs are met through piped natural gas and, eventually, liquefied natural gas.&nbsp; We also use fuel oils at peaks, and solar and other sources would become additions to that array.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other question is on reflection of priorities, as evidenced by subsidies and so on.&nbsp; I think Ms Olsen is going back to her point about why we cannot subsidise or do feed-in-tariffs.&nbsp; There is a fundamental difference.&nbsp; When we talk about energy subsidies, energy is a very basic commodity that cuts through the entire economy.&nbsp; The question to be asked is what do we gain by subsidising solar power.&nbsp; This is because the true cost of solar power is indeed higher.&nbsp; If the intention is to promote the industry, then the right strategy is to help the industry get to a position of competitiveness <I>vis-a-vis</I> existing supplies of energy.&nbsp; That is why we are investing in R&amp;D and other technology measures in order to help solar reach that stage, as indeed any other sector that we are able to support.&nbsp;&nbsp;But to subsidise is to distort <p align=left>Column: 1668<p>the market in terms of production&nbsp;and consumption decisions, and we do not think that is the right thing to do.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Indeed, over the last few years, we have seen significant improvements in our healthcare system, which have made our lives better even as we grapple with the issues of rising costs due to an ageing population, new medical technology and higher expectations.&nbsp; MOH should be commended for these changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to note that the MOH&rsquo;s budget for this year has increased by 19%. This is a good sign as our national healthcare expenditure of 4% is way below that of many developed countries and, with an ageing population, it will be difficult to&nbsp;maintain even&nbsp;the current level of healthcare service and quality without any increase in the budget.&nbsp; The burden cannot be completely shifted to individuals who are already contributing 41%&nbsp;to the total&nbsp;national healthcare expenditure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would like to ask the Minister where these additional health dollars will be channelled to? What improvements and changes in healthcare can we expect with this increase? How will the increased budget improve the lives of patients in the polyclinics and hospitals?&nbsp; How would the quality of healthcare in Singapore improve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1673<p> I would also like to ask the Minister, how have we prepared our healthcare system to meet the challenges of a rapidly ageing population&nbsp;and whether part of the increased budget will be used to further develop the infrastructure, systems and services for the elderly.&nbsp; This is a serious problem as our population aged 65 years and above will increase from 8% today to 18% by 2030.&nbsp; The elderly will use between three to five times more healthcare services compared to the younger population and each episode amounts to about&nbsp;two times more than the average cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In dealing with the elderly, the current focus of our healthcare system appears to be still on how to manage episodes of acute illness with intensive treatment.&nbsp; But this is not well suited to manage the medical problems of the elderly.&nbsp; The elderly need continuous low intensity medical or nursing care to manage their chronic illness and to enable them to live good quality lives even if they&nbsp;have age-related disability.&nbsp; New alternative types of cost-effective community-based long-term care, including hospice and home care, will have to be further integrated with health-care financing. I hope to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response on this as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singaporeans are concerned about rising medical costs. Last year, medical inflation went up by 6.2%, almost three times&nbsp;the rate of the&nbsp;general inflation rate.&nbsp; Over the last two years, the average hospital bills have gone up by 10% to 30%, and it was the C class wards which had the highest percentage increase. &nbsp;Those who stayed in the C class wards now pay an average of $1,112, 30% more than the 2005 average of $858.&nbsp; Last year, a Tan Tock Seng Hospital survey among 200 patients with chronic conditions found that one in five among them failed to keep up with their medication because they cannot afford it.&nbsp; A 2007 of <I>The New Paper</I> poll among 125 people aged 18 to 65 years revealed <p align=left>Column: 1674<p>that two-thirds worry about medical costs for serious illness or accidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, addressing these concerns of Singaporeans are important.&nbsp; Equally important is how to help Singaporeans better plan for and manage&nbsp;their own healthcare needs.&nbsp; One great lapse in planning is the absence of&nbsp; insurance coverage or insufficient coverage by many Singaporeans.&nbsp; 200,000 housewives, for instance, are not covered under MediShield and a significant number are under insured as far as MediShield is concerned.&nbsp; This is certainly one area that we need to pay greater attention to in the years ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what steps are being taken to control increases in medical costs. Efforts are being made to control demand for medical services through means testing and co-payments, for instance, and the supply of medical services, such as through the control of the number of doctors, but the public also need to know what is being done to control medical costs. For even if medical services are highly subsidised, if the portion that people have to pay keeps on increasing, the overall cost to them will continue to go up.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Health Care Costs</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan):</B> Sir, while one can discern lifestyle factors like poor diet, stress and lack of physical exercise as the causes behind sicknesses, ill health can strike anyone, male or female, young or old, rich or poor.&nbsp; Hence, healthcare strikes an uneasy chord with everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, many baby boomers, like myself, now have aged parents who are suffering from some chronic or critical illness.&nbsp; Soon, I too will enter the exalted ranks of senior citizenship.&nbsp; I also need to worry about the state of my own health.&nbsp; What is the <p align=left>Column: 1675<p>use of a long life if it is not lived healthily and what is the use of a lifelong annuity if so much of it goes towards paying medical bills.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recent changes to MediShield to reduce co-payment by patients and Medisave to cover&nbsp;outpatient treatment of various chronic diseases are welcome.&nbsp; Nonetheless, more needs to be done to further reduce co-payment by patients.&nbsp; We should also examine ways to allow claims for other chronic and debilitating diseases, such as dementia and Alzheimer, which strike many elderly and exact a large toll on caregivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that drugs prescribe to treat these ailments are not subsidised at all, even for Class C patients.&nbsp; Moreover, means testing will soon be introduced.&nbsp; The Health Minister's assurance that MOH will err on the side of generosity has yet to completely allay the fears of the middle-class who expect to be most affected by it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While many are relieved that they will be allowed to choose the ward class they desire and still enjoy some subsidy, albeit a reduced one for Class C and B wards, they nonetheless&nbsp;have concerns about the actual implementation details.&nbsp; The biggest concern are for those who stay in private property and earn a salary above the maximum qualifying income to enjoy the full subsidy, but who may actually have many dependants and financial commitments.&nbsp; In practice, they may not always be&nbsp;better off than their compatriots staying in public housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is, how compassionate and flexible would the hospital be in handling such cases?&nbsp; Can an independent appeals board be set up to look into such cases on appeal?&nbsp; For consistency, these appeals board could handle cases from all public hospitals.&nbsp; To allay unnecessary anxiety of the patient and his or her <p align=left>Column: 1676<p>immediate family, the appeal should be expeditiously resolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, as a <I>Straits Times</I> article suggested, a fund for bridging loan could be set up for families adversely affected by hefty medical bills and yet do not qualify for Medifund.&nbsp; This will allow them temporary reprieve to sort out their financial problems.&nbsp; There is also feedback of unsympathetic rules relating&nbsp;to transfer of patients from one class ward to another.&nbsp; Recently, a friend of mine shared that his mother-in-law who was suffering from advanced stage cancer was warded in Class C.&nbsp; Towards the end, they transferred her to Class A and then they were told that all their bills for non-ward charges had to be backdated based on Class A ward.&nbsp; The question is, why should&nbsp;the non-ward charges be backdated since they&nbsp;had, prior to the upgrade, not enjoyed any of the high class services and it was only out of convenience for the family members that they had decided to upgrade?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Healthcare Financing</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080303/20080303VS_102750.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</i> ]&nbsp; Medical cost and medical expenses have become a cause of concern of our people. Our Health Minister has already announced that this year, he is going to extend the MediShield protection to cover 80% of the high hospitalisation expenses. We hope this can be implemented quickly.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody needs healthcare protection. So everyone must be insured, including their family members, and it is good that our medical insurance is an important part of our social security net. We must let all workers understand the importance of insurance.&nbsp; Therefore, I propose that NTUC, CASE and GIA promote awareness about the medical insurance through a national medical insurance education, and also to insure <p align=left>Column: 1677<p>themselves and their families as early as possible. Because of ageing and changing medical conditions, one day our people may become uninsurable and they will be rejected by an insurance company. Also, we must include the housewives under the MediShield scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the Singapore Fire Service, they have adopted a different strategy, that is, they have changed their strategy from extinguishing fire to preventing fire.&nbsp; Similarly, in our healthcare financing, we should shift our focus to promote healthy lifestyle and preventive healthcare measures, because prevention is better than cure.&nbsp; Therefore, it is more effective for us to promote healthcare development and let our people watch out for their health, rather than increase the number of hospital beds and increase the subsidy.&nbsp; So we must help our people monitor their health risk and advise them to be careful of their physical health. According to statistics, the number of diabetes cases has risen from 4.7% in 1975 to 8.2%. Therefore, we should help our people stay healthy so that they will not cause a burden to the society.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1801-1802.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Means Testing</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.30 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, the problem is not with means testing <I>per se</I>, but with the implementation.&nbsp; I urge the Minister to ensure that the implementation of means testing will be equitable, efficient and effective.&nbsp; Let me touch on three points.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the cut in the subsidy levels for different categories of patient and ward classes should be fair and affordable.&nbsp; Here, I urge the Minister to err on the side of generosity when he decides on where to draw the line, to ensure that the majority continues to receive the same level of subsidies as they do today and will not be affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1678<p> Second, ensure that the entire process is seen to be fair and transparent.&nbsp; It should not discriminate against the disadvantaged and add to the financial burden of those in poor health.&nbsp; Rules should be flexible in marginal and exceptional cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the testing mechanism should be administratively simple and not time consuming and costly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even as the Ministry of Health focuses on means testing for better cost recovery and allocation of scarce resources, I urge the Ministry to also look at other areas to control cost and ensure that healthcare remains affordable.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to pay special attention to housewives as 200,000 of them are not covered under Medishield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to give us an update on means testing, particularly the details such as the income levels and levels of subsidy for the different categories of patients and ward charges.

&nbsp;Somebody has to pay for this and, more likely than not, the patient will end up paying for it.&nbsp; Would it not be prudent for MOH to manage expectations rather than to raise them and increase cost unnecessarily?&nbsp; I believe most patients in Class B2 or C wards will understand why they will not <p align=left>Column: 1680<p>be getting the same comforts or are not able to choose their doctors, unlike those in other wards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been argued that means testing is already implemented in public housing.&nbsp; So, why not for hospitalisation?&nbsp; There is a significant difference.&nbsp; Households earning $3,000 or less are entitled to a 3-room flat, while those earning under $8,000 qualify for a 5-room flat.&nbsp; Those with higher incomes get less subsidies, but their flats are bigger which they can also monetise and sell for more.&nbsp; Public housing is touted as a way to build up wealth for the future.&nbsp; Thus, means testing for public housing based on market subsidies is still quite acceptable to people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the root of this means testing should be about whether there are some baseline expectations which Singaporeans should have of the Government.&nbsp; What essential services should we expect to be available to everyone equally, regardless of means?&nbsp; For instance, when it comes to education, all Singaporeans can have their children educated in the mainstream schools.&nbsp; Education too is a heavily subsidised item, but everyone, rich or poor, pays the same fees for basic primary or secondary education.&nbsp; Why is the Government not pushing for means testing in mainstream education then, with children paying fees on a sliding scale, depending on household income?&nbsp; Could it be because the Government sees education as an investment while hospitalisation is seen as a liability?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To paraphrase the words of the Health Minister, everyone needs healthcare most towards the latter part of his life, when he or she is not at the peak in earnings.&nbsp; Means testing for hospitals will create a lot of uncertainties for many citizens at a time in their lives when affordability of healthcare is most critical.&nbsp; Singaporeans should not be subject to such anxieties.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)--><p align=left>Column: 1681<p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, MOH will be introducing means testing this year.&nbsp; I strongly support the principle of subsidies being channelled such that those who need more help will get more.&nbsp; This is a sound principle.&nbsp; It is fair and equitable, and must be beyond question.&nbsp; But as with all things, the devil is in the details.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to touch on two aspects.&nbsp; Firstly, the proposed method for assessing income.&nbsp; To keep things simple, MOH intends to use personal income for those who are working and housing type for those who are not.&nbsp; Sir, I touched on this when I spoke on the Budget Statement.&nbsp; This will effectively penalise households with a low per capita income, in particular, higher income earners with big families and multiple dependants. The Minister has said that the implementation will be flexible and will allow for special deserving circumstances.&nbsp; For instance, hospital medical&nbsp;social workers will review the cases of those with a large number of dependants.&nbsp; But this results in uncertainty and delay, which are the very drawbacks that the simple system was supposed to address.&nbsp; I think most people would agree that, in principle, household per capita income is a better indicator of neediness than personal income or housing type, and I believe that this can be implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, IRAS records data on declared wages as well as all tax reliefs claims.&nbsp; The tax reliefs claim by a person would be objective evidence of the dependants in that household.&nbsp; The declared incomes of all persons with the same address can then be aggregated and used to calculate the per capita for that household.&nbsp; IRAS can do this and maintain a back end system storing the means tested status of Singaporeans, which hospitals can then access to ascertain&nbsp;patients' means tested status.&nbsp; For those who do not file returns or pay taxes, they can be asked to file returns to claim the dependant's tax <p align=left>Column: 1682<p>reliefs they are eligible for, for purposes of means testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would now like to touch on the savings from means testing will be used.&nbsp; It does not seem that the current subsidies for Class C and B2 wards will be increased.&nbsp; Instead, the Minister intends to upgrade the quality of these wards.&nbsp; I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider that decision.&nbsp; Do we really need to close the gap between the different classes of wards so much?&nbsp; I think most Singaporeans would prefer to maintain the current gap between Class C and B2 wards over having means testing.&nbsp; Instead, I think there is a strong case for increasing the subsidy for Class C wards for the lowest income.&nbsp; Using the cost savings to give more help to the neediest Singaporeans is a much stronger justification for introducing means testing.&nbsp; Just as there will be a sliding scale of decreasing subsidy for those above the 50th percentile, we can also introduce a sliding scale of increasing subsidy for those below, say, the 25th percentile for Class C wards.&nbsp; Or if it is difficult to get accurate data for these income groups to identify their percentiles, then perhaps we can simply provide a higher subsidy for those living in HDB rental flats or 1- or 2-room flats.&nbsp; This will maintain the economic principle of co-payment while ensuring that those who need the most help do get it.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, I declare my interest as an employee of a step-down care hospital.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the Health Ministry's plan to implement means testing in the restructured hospitals to better allocate limited healthcare resources. However, from all that have been reviewed, the new model of means testing in restructured hospitals will be substantially different from that currently used in the step-down care setting of community hospitals, chronic sick hospitals and nursing homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1683<p> The proposed new model for restructured hospitals will be more generous to allow high income patients from the top 20% to remain heavily subsidised if they choose B2 or C wards, whereas anyone with per capita household income of more than $1,000 now is not subsidised at the step-down care.&nbsp; The new model will have a gradual sliding scale of subsidy with reduction in 1% point from 80% to 65% in a C Class ward, and from 65% to 50% in a B2 ward.&nbsp; Whereas the reduction in the step-down care now is much bigger, at 25%, and the subsidy is set at 75%. 50%, 25% or 0%.&nbsp; The new model will be based on the patient's declared income as the sole criterion,&nbsp;whereas the step-down care currently looks at the income of patients and all immediate family members as well as the ownership of major assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we can see that the new model is simpler, easier to implement and more generous, but yet it remains fair to some extent.&nbsp; Therefore, I urge the Ministry to consider using the new model, if possible, or something similar to this model that we are talking about, for both restructured hospitals and step-down care facilities. This will minimise confusion to the public who see the two hospital systems as one and the same of a public healthcare system.&nbsp; Having one model will also mean that patients need to be tested only once and, hence, reducing duplication or administrative work at the step-down care.&nbsp; One model will also prevent the occurrence of situations where a patient could qualify for subsidy in restructured hospitals but not in the step-down care.&nbsp; When such a situation arises, the patient may refuse to be transferred to the step-down care facilities, and it will result in choking and wastage of acute hospital beds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what has been revealed so far about means testing at the restructured <p align=left>Column: 1684<p>hospitals has allayed some of the initial public anxieties.&nbsp; The Ministry should now follow through to make sure that the means testing system in our healthcare system is simple, clear and unambiguous, a system that is seamless and allow patients to move between restructured and step-down care facilities easily and readily, and means tested only once.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I> ): [<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080303/20080303VS_102435.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</i>]&nbsp; Sir, during the 2006 General Election, I asked the Government whether it would implement means testing.&nbsp; The Health Minister's answer then was that he had not thought about the question.&nbsp; However, he has now decided to implement means testing.&nbsp; The questions we should focus on are:\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; As a matter of principle, is it correct? Hospitalisation is a critical need of the people when they fall sick, which must be assured.&nbsp; It is just like defence which is the security safeguard critical to the people.&nbsp; Thus, all male citizens have to fulfill National Service duties.&nbsp; Regardless of whether one perceives himself to be fit enough or to have the capability to become a soldier, he will be enlisted into NS.&nbsp; Similarly, the Government has the same obligation, based on the same principle to provide a medical safety net to the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Who should decide the affordability level of medical expenses?&nbsp;&nbsp; Means testing deprives Singaporeans of the right to determine for themselves what they can afford for hospitalisation.&nbsp; This is a fundamental change.&nbsp; Currently, patients evaluate their&nbsp; own financial situation to decide which class of hospital ward to be admitted to, as the Government subsidies are simply based on different classes of hospital ward .&nbsp; With means testing, even if a patient feels that he cannot afford the medical expenses and decides to be admitted to&nbsp; C class ward, the Govern<p align=left>Column: 1685<p>ment will use means testing to prescribe his capacity to pay and determine that he&nbsp;pays higher medical fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; What is the motive for implementing means testing?&nbsp; The purpose is to allow the Government to justify reducing healthcare subsidies in the name of charging patients based on affordability. The outcome must be that some patients or, in the future, perhaps most patients who are admitted to Class C and B2 wards would be paying higher medical fees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, a patient can decide which class of ward to be admitted to during hospitalisation and the Government subsidies are in accordance with different classes of hospital ward. This is the last line of defence in our social safety net and a critical safeguard in healthcare for Singaporeans Implementation of&nbsp; hospitalisation means testing will surely increase Singaporeans' anxiety over the lack of social security in life.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1803-1804.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>): [<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080303/20080303VS_102332.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</i>]&nbsp; Mr Chairman, I want to suggest the repositioning of the means testing survey for the Class C patients.&nbsp; Class C is the focus of the means testing survey.&nbsp; Under Class C, there are basically three groups.&nbsp; For the first group, the Government will subsidise 80%.&nbsp; For the second group, they will be subsidised 66-79%.&nbsp; For the third group, they will only be getting 65% subsidy.&nbsp; So this is a new system and grouping distribution.&nbsp; The Minister has conducted a lot of seminars and dialogues to share with our people the long-term plan, and he managed to get the people's understanding and support.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the Ministry has to reposition the Class C wards.&nbsp; They must have a comprehensive and fair distribution method, in order for people to use it practically and adopt this Class C policy.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1686<p>I suggest that the name \"C Class\" be changed to \"E Class\" in order to improve its overall image and to get better support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To some of us, the Class C ward is all right but some patients and their family members are very superstitious and sometimes they do not even mention the letter \"C\".&nbsp; Recently, I met an old lady whose husband was sick and had to be hospitalised. &nbsp;I asked which ward he was staying in because I might be able to visit him if I had time.&nbsp; She said in <I>Teochew</I>, \"A lot of people stay together in the ward.\"&nbsp; So I said, \"Oh, it is a C class ward.\"&nbsp; She said, \"Don't talk about it.&nbsp; The letter \"C\" in dialect is bad luck.\" &nbsp;In fact, the implication of this letter \"C\" in our Oriental society, especially Singapore, is very sensitive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Japanese car name, like Honda Concerto, in <I>Hokkien</I>, it means \"company collapse\".&nbsp; Therefore, the businessmen do not buy it and the Alpha Romeo 164 model in <I>Hokkien</I> means \"die all the way\".&nbsp; Therefore, nobody dares to buy it.&nbsp; Later on, they changed the name to Alpha Romeo 168.&nbsp; It means \"prosperity all the way\".&nbsp; Similarly, after changing the name, if the cars are selling like hot cakes, it shows that people are generally affected by the names.&nbsp; It is business and cultural sensitivity and we must suit their need and change their mindset.&nbsp; Therefore, I suggest that we change the name \"C Class\" to \"E Class\", just like the Economy Class in an aeroplane.&nbsp; So, these are the three categories. It can be set as E1 Class, E2 Class and E3 Class, and each category receives different amounts of subsidies.&nbsp; If you choose a good name for the class, it may help reduce the psychological burden and worries of the patient.&nbsp; If the name is right, people will feel good and it may help them recover faster.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1805-1806.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

If he is not working, the criterion will be the housing type.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as for the&nbsp;reduction in subsidy for higher income earners for B2 and C wards, one wonders whether this will really deter them.&nbsp; The overall reduction in cash terms may not deter those in the top 20th percentile of income earners, though it may deter those between the 20th and 50th percentile.&nbsp; Perhaps a better gauge of financial ability would be the household income per head.&nbsp; This would be&nbsp;more accurate in determining if a subsidy is necessary.&nbsp; A patient earning $3,000 a month, for example,&nbsp;may have children and parents to feed as well.&nbsp; He may not even have medical insurance.&nbsp; To deprive him of subsidies because he is not in the bottom half of all workers&nbsp;will be counter-productive to the aims of the subsidies in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another problem relates to the choice of criteria for means testing for the unemployed.&nbsp; Housing type may not be the best indicator because some Singaporeans&nbsp; may be asset rich but cash poor.&nbsp; These Singaporeans may also need help from subsidies to get by.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, healthcare costs are rising at a time when we are implementing a means testing system.&nbsp; Can the Ministry conduct a study on the cost breakdown in healthcare for us to better understand what are the contributing factors to healthcare costs and formulate cost-cutting measures accordingly?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The framework should clarify the assumptions of what the extent of State responsibility is.&nbsp; How does Government decide when means testing becomes applicable for what are considered traditionally basic State responsibilities?&nbsp; How can Singaporeans be assured that with similar rising&nbsp; costs, other essential services such as education, defence, security and use of public amenities&nbsp;will&nbsp;not one day be subjected to means testing?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the different ways by which means testing is applied in the various public programmes should also be rationalised and made clearer.&nbsp; Currently, each Ministry decides when and how means testing is applied.&nbsp; Hence, for public housing, only those earning below a total household income of $8,000 are eligible.&nbsp; For MCYS' social services programmes, different per capita income criteria are applied and now the Health Minister has mentioned at a public forum that he is looking at a more lenient income range.&nbsp; Sir, lest it be mistaken that it is up to the imagination of each Minister, a formula by which eligibility and corresponding subsidies are fixed should be developed and communicated in the means testing framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Sir, whilst I appreciate the Health Minister's desire to keep the means test simple, it must not be so simplistic that it ignores&nbsp;important considerations.&nbsp; The Minister has&nbsp;mentioned about the use of a simple means test that looks at the&nbsp;patient's average&nbsp;salary in the last&nbsp;12 months or his housing type.&nbsp;&nbsp;Social service experts have long found that means testing based on per capita household income is a fairer formula.&nbsp; For example, the financial burden on a Singaporean with a monthly income of $5,000 supporting three children is clearly heavier than if he is childless or has only one child.&nbsp; Also, on behalf of the disabled community, I&nbsp;ask <p align=left>Column: 1689<p>that extra marks be given in the means test to young and old Singaporeans who are disabled and are not eligible for any medical insurance relating to their disabilities.&nbsp; They should not have to suffer the double whammy of being excluded from medical insurance related to their disabilities and then undergo means testing as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to pilot the administration system first before implementing the means test system.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But equally urgent is the need to make sure that we are adequately covered for our medical needs during our old age.&nbsp; A person could&nbsp; have a retirement&nbsp; income but&nbsp;&nbsp;that will do him little good if medical bills erode all his savings.&nbsp; This will surely happen if he does not have an insurance covering him beyond 85 years of age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clearly incongruent, in my view, for us to worry about someone's retirement income after the age of 85 but to be less concerned&nbsp;over whether or not he can afford to pay his bills after that age.&nbsp; In fact, a recent Ministry&nbsp;study shows that while Singaporeans are living longer, they will also spend the last eight years of their&nbsp;life in poor health.&nbsp; So, Sir, I urge&nbsp;the Ministry to remove the age cap of 85 years on MediShield.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)--><p align=left>Column: 1690<p>\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I realise there are already efforts going on to bring back some of our own medical students and doctors trained overseas.&nbsp; These projected numbers of doctors will become important in the coming 10 to 20 years as we deal with a population that is ageing rapidly, living longer and with a higher incidence of chronic illnesses as well.&nbsp;

As announced in the 2008 Budget, we are investing $900 million over the next five years to improve the infrastructure and facilities.&nbsp; In addition&nbsp;to that, we have also allocated another $1 billion to be spent over the next five years for the recruitment and training of healthcare professionals in the public sector.&nbsp; I believe this is a step in the right direction, especially when we know that the life expectancy of Singaporeans continues to increase.&nbsp; We have to be ready with infrastructure and medical professionals to handle the increase&nbsp;in the&nbsp;senior population.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1691<p> The elderly have many medical needs of varying dimensions and their care requires a multi-disciplinary healthcare team.&nbsp; Our ageing population would have serious implications for the number of healthcare professionals required.&nbsp; In 2003, when the proportion of Singapore's population aged 15 years and below was 21% and that above 65 years was 8%, there were 184 pediatricians and only 32 geriatricians.&nbsp; However, by the year 2015, both Singapore's population aged below 15 and above 65 is projected to be around 19% each, making the proportion of younger persons to older persons equal.&nbsp; This means that we will have a higher demand for geriatricians, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, dieticians and medical social workers.&nbsp; Are we doing enough to recruit and train the medical professionals to meet this demand.&nbsp; Are our local universities conducting the post-graduate courses in these relevant fields?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned that the booming health tourism industry will result in the migration of doctors, specialists and other healthcare professionals from the public to the private sector either within Singapore or internationally.&nbsp; The needs of public healthcare professionals have to be looked at seriously to avoid a shortage in the future.&nbsp; In addition to providing attractive remuneration, we should also look at their career path, training and development needs to retain the professionals within the public sector.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B> Sir, last year, Er Lee Bee Wah nearly brought the House down with a colourful <I>Hokkien</I> proverb.&nbsp; She wanted to stress the importance of forward planning and preparing for the future.&nbsp; In ancient China, the Prime Minister of the State Qi (<I>chun qiu shi qi qi guo</I> ), Guan-Zhong put it strategically:&nbsp; <I>\"yi nian zhi ji, mo ru shu gu, shi nian zhi ji, mo ru shu mu, zhong shen zhi ji, mo ru shu ren.</I>\"&nbsp;&nbsp; Guan-Zhong's political thought is that public policies must look far beyond one or even 10 years as affairs of the state impact people's lives and one important public policy is to nurture talent and cultivate people.&nbsp; I try to bring this philosophy into my work.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Health Minister, my job is to look at healthcare, not just for today or tomorrow, but over a much longer timeframe.&nbsp; Within a few years, I would be retired and potentially become a customer of healthcare providers for the subsequent 20 years, like Dr Amy Khor.&nbsp; To me, health policies are not drawn up in a vacuum or just about focusing on numbers.&nbsp; Health policies are about creating a good healthcare system that is sustainable and relevant to real people, like you and me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some advantage of a long association with the Health Ministry.&nbsp; I had the opportunity to study other healthcare systems and think through <p align=left>Column: 1693<p>many issues.&nbsp; There is no perfect healthcare system, but there are positive elements in some which can be incorporated, just as there are clear pitfalls we must avoid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health policies need a long lead time to see results.&nbsp; And as healthcare is an emotive subject, we need to consult the people widely&nbsp;and patiently with every policy change.&nbsp; So a radical, big-bang complete overhaul approach to healthcare reform is not advisable.&nbsp; Instead, it is through a series of deliberate, carefully considered incremental policy changes over many years that we can build a sustainable healthcare system.&nbsp; And that is how we have built up our 3Ms framework over 25 years and how we are continuing to make it stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, Singaporeans can be proud of our healthcare system.&nbsp; It is far from perfect.&nbsp; But the World Health Organisation has rated it No. 6 in the world.&nbsp; It has enabled Singaporeans to enjoy the high standard of care.&nbsp; With less abuse in the system, our health spending at below 4% of GDP is the lowest among developed countries.&nbsp; And we should try to retain this ranking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, we continue to build for the future.&nbsp; Last year, I announced a 10-year capital development plan, costing $2 billion.&nbsp; This will expand our capacity further.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are busily implementing this plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mdm Halimah, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Dr Amy Khor, I worry a lot about rising healthcare costs.&nbsp; Our population is expanding and rapidly ageing.&nbsp; New technology is generating more sophisticated treatment which is almost always more costly.&nbsp; There is a big debate&nbsp;right now in US and UK over this new drug calls Avastin, which is for treating late-stage breast cancer.&nbsp; It is not a cure but some studies show that it could prolong the life of a patient by about a couple of months.&nbsp; But it comes <p align=left>Column: 1694<p>at a huge price tag: US$100,000.&nbsp; Many families will be financially ruined just to try to extend the life for a few weeks, with much suffering for the patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;But two weeks ago, US FDA against expert advice approved the drug for late-stage breast cancer.&nbsp; Immediately, on the same day, the share price of the company went up 8% against this current sub-prime concern and possible economic recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back here, in Singapore, we know we need to improve the doctor-to-patient ratio to allow enough time for each patient.&nbsp; Our doctors and healthcare professionals are over-worked, and they need a life too.&nbsp; I know our Director of Medical Services, Prof. Satku, is sleeping less and less, juggling between his surgeries at NUH, meetings at MOH and with international counterparts.&nbsp; And the situation is the same with the other senior consultants&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Prof. Tan Ser Kiat at&nbsp;SGH, Prof. Philip Choo at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and&nbsp;Prof. Benjamin Ong at NUH.&nbsp; But it is not just the senior consultants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young doctors too are also working day and night to meet the needs of increasingly more demanding patients and relatives.&nbsp; I am sure Dr Fatimah Lateef, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Dr Lam can testify to this.&nbsp; And some of the parents of these young doctors are in this House too.&nbsp; I doubt you see much of them at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctors like everybody else would like to enjoy a better worklife balance but the patients just keep coming,&nbsp;and not just local patients.&nbsp; An increasing number of foreigners are coming here for treatment.&nbsp; This is good for the economy, for the hotels, and a testament to our high standard of care,&nbsp;but it does put pressure on manpower.&nbsp; At least two new private hospitals will open in three years' time.&nbsp; We will face a worsening staff shortage.&nbsp; Our specialists are trained at top centres around the world and they are much sought after.&nbsp; We need to ensure our remuneration packages are competitive to retain this key talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1695<p>And it is not just our doctors we try to retain.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a point that Mayor Zainudin mentioned.&nbsp; The booming hospitality sector driven by the IRs will put great pressure on other manpower.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are poaching not only from the zoo,&nbsp;but poaching from the hospitals too.&nbsp; Healthcare workers are going to have other opportunities outside healthcare. &nbsp;And we need to keep them at least to retain&nbsp;a fair share of them in healthcare with comparable pay and working conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I have sought a substantial increase in budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by Mdm Halimah, this Health budget will go up by 19% over the last budget, a significant increase of $421 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will fund both hardware and software and more initiatives to improve clinical outcomes and increase productivity.&nbsp; Our bed-to-population ratio will go up from 1.6 to 1.8 (per 1,000 population) by 2015,&nbsp;but it will still be lower than the rates in other developed countries today.&nbsp; We will also watch over our average length of stay in the acute hospitals which, at 5.3 days, is among the lowest in the world and must remain so.&nbsp; This means that a patient who is medically fit for discharge must vacate his bed to go home or to a nursing home, if necessary.&nbsp; Over the break, I had an interesting conversation with Mdm Cynthia Phua over&nbsp;an incident of a friend or relative who was being asked by&nbsp;a hospital to&nbsp;go home.&nbsp; And this is the reason.&nbsp; We need to price our hospital facilities correctly, so as to discourage unnecessary prolonged hospitalisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah and Mr Zainudin stressed the importance of getting more manpower to cope with rising demand, and I fully agree.&nbsp; That is why we are spending $1.9 billion over the next five years to expand our pool of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, <p align=left>Column: 1696<p>physiotherapists and other allied health professionals by 40%.&nbsp; We are actively recruiting from abroad to supplement the local pool, and we have some success to report.&nbsp; Last year, for example, NUS graduated 230 doctors.&nbsp; But we recruited 438 doctors, almost double,&nbsp;who graduated overseas, largely from our approved list.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are good medical schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased budget will also allow us to double the number of scholarships for the allied health professionals to 120 this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are starting a new scholarship to sponsor some graduates from Nanyang Polytechnic to pursue a one-year degree conversion course overseas.&nbsp; Many are doing physiotherapy diploma and they want to&nbsp; go to Australia, one year conversion course,&nbsp;and come back with a degree.&nbsp; So I thought, let us offer&nbsp;the best students&nbsp;scholarships each year, say,&nbsp;a dozen or two and we can always ramp up the number later.&nbsp; We can bond them to&nbsp;return to work in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These increases should lead to better service levels, but they will also add to our costs.&nbsp; Our health spending will go up from 4% of GDP to 5% or 6% in the medium term.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also fuel healthcare inflation, which Mdm Halimah, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and others expressed a lot of concern about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous Parliament sitting, I have explained the high healthcare inflation in Singapore in the past one year.&nbsp; At 6.3%, updated to 7.4% recently, it was exceptional to the norm of about 2% per annum for several years.&nbsp; And there were several contributing factors to this exceptionally high rate.&nbsp; Huge imported cost increases were a major factor, pushing up prices of medical supplies and medicine, both western as well as traditional Chinese medicine.&nbsp; Those of you who are familiar with cordyceps \" <I>dong chong cao\"</I> will know how much it has gone up&nbsp;&ndash; mind boggling!&nbsp; It just reflects the rise of the middle class in <p align=left>Column: 1697<p>China itself so that there is strong demand for this limited supply, and prices go up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imported cost increase have affected the private sector.&nbsp; Last week, I heard Dr Ahmad Magad relating a personal experience when his daughter was hospitalised.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He said he almost fainted when he received the bill&nbsp;&ndash; more than $2,200 for a two-day stay.&nbsp; I did some mental calculations.&nbsp; It cannot be a public hospital.&nbsp; So I queried him during the break and asked him, \"Which hospital did she go to?\"&nbsp; \"A private hospital\", he said.&nbsp;Public hospitals are not spared such imported inflation.&nbsp; But part of the cost increases is also due to higher public expectation and their demand for higher-end care.&nbsp; Just now, Ms Sylvia Lim said that&nbsp;we should not raise public expectations.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; As a strategy, I would be the last one to want to fan up public expectations.&nbsp; But I cannot ignore rising public expectations.&nbsp; Her message to me just now was to keep still.&nbsp; Enough Class C, remain like today, or even scale back so that it is absolutely no frills, very basic.&nbsp; Do you think Singaporeans&nbsp;will agree and say, \"All right,&nbsp;let us do it, scale back, and we go back to the Class C of 1970s\"?&nbsp; I do not think that would be the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, while we should be the last one to want to fan up public expectation and will constantly&nbsp;remind Singaporeans: please moderate your expectations because the higher&nbsp;your expectation, the higher must be the cost.&nbsp; While we will bear most of the cost, you have to co-share, too.&nbsp; So, it cannot be just keep on raising public expectation and demand without wanting to pay something for the additional cost that will be incurred.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give Members an example: attendances in our Emergency Department.&nbsp; I have been tracking this number <p align=left>Column: 1698<p>because it has been worrying me for quite some time.&nbsp; Last year, the number went up 11%, a very high rate.&nbsp; In the previous three years, the rate of increase was 7%, which had already alarmed us because it was higher than the previous 10-year average of 4.5% per annum.&nbsp; What is happening?&nbsp; Our population is not growing at 7% or 11%.&nbsp; Are Singaporeans getting sicker?&nbsp; Are we getting into more accidents?&nbsp; Or are we now rushing to Emergency Departments too readily and perhaps unnecessarily?&nbsp; There is therefore a need to price our services properly so that we do not inadvertently attract non-emergency patients to our Emergency Departments.&nbsp; Non-emergency patients should go to their family GPs.&nbsp; Every Singaporean must have a family GP to whom they consult all the time, who knows their whole family well.&nbsp; They should not rush to Emergency Departments and compete for the resources which are really meant for the critically ill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will do our best to manage cost escalation, difficult as it is, and during this period of high inflation, our public hospitals will be particularly careful.&nbsp; They cannot freeze their charges, because imported inflation will have to be passed through.&nbsp; So for expensive drugs -&nbsp;unfortunately, the tender price has gone up - the fees have to go up.&nbsp;But they will not add to other cost increases unnecessarily.&nbsp; They will also play their part by promoting greater use of generics instead of brand name medicines, and standard medical supplies instead of non-standard appliances like stents or implants.&nbsp; And they will help the patients to get treated at the right settings.&nbsp; For these, our hospitals require the cooperation of our patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, in healthcare, patients have a big part to play.&nbsp; How?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, stay within our 3Ms framework.&nbsp; Contribute to Medisave.&nbsp; All employees <p align=left>Column: 1699<p>do, because it is compulsory.&nbsp; Otherwise, we will take the employers to task.&nbsp; But many self-employed and casual workers are still not regular contributors to Medisave or are not contributing enough.&nbsp; We must persuade them to do so and do more for their own good and the good of their families.&nbsp; And let us not forget the housewives too.&nbsp; Husbands should help contribute to their Medisave accounts.&nbsp; CPF Board has a voluntary contribution scheme and, now, there are some tax incentives that go along with it.&nbsp; I urge all husbands to top up their wives' Medisave accounts, especially if they are full-time homemakers.&nbsp; I think this must be one of the basic duties of husbands, and we should remind them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, subscribe to MediShield.&nbsp; I totally agree with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that all Singaporeans should subscribe to MediShield.&nbsp; It is as simple as that.&nbsp; Every one should have MediShield at least.&nbsp; Nearly 80% of Singaporeans do, fortunately.&nbsp; But what about the remaining 20%?&nbsp; They must come in too.&nbsp; Big numbers of uninsured are young kids.&nbsp; So, last December, we changed the rule.&nbsp; Now, all newborns are automatically covered.&nbsp; We are working with the&nbsp;CPF Board and the Ministry of Education, and we will proceed to sign on all the students who are in schools.&nbsp; In addition, we are working with NTUC, especially with Mdm Halimah, to get workers to buy MediShield for their spouses.&nbsp; This is the second basic duty of husbands.&nbsp; Get them MediShield.&nbsp; Through these efforts, we aim to raise MediShield coverage, first,&nbsp;to 85%, and when we arrive, we will&nbsp;shoot for 90%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the middle and high-income Singaporeans should top up their basic MediShield with riders.&nbsp; Basic MediShield is not enough for the middle and upper-income group.&nbsp; So, buy MediShield but also top up with a private rider, which is <p align=left>Column: 1700<p>provided by so many private insurers, because that will then enable you for admission to private hospitals, Class A/B1 wards.&nbsp; MediShield is designed only for Class B2/C.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not designed for private wards.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans are still under-insured, probably due to inertia or possibly ignorance.&nbsp; So we&nbsp;will continue to educate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, of course, will do its part.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we are strengthening Medifund and Eldercare Fund.&nbsp; This year, the&nbsp;$600 million top-up to these funds&nbsp;will provide our hospitals, community hospitals and nursing homes with more funds&nbsp;to help patients who need additional assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I am finalising the details of the next reform to MediShield, to further improve its coverage of large B2/C bills.&nbsp; I welcome Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's strong support for the proposed reform.&nbsp; This is taking some time as we are trying to keep premium increases as affordable as possible, while increasing the payout to cover, I hope,&nbsp;nearly 80% of large bills.&nbsp; But these are&nbsp;two contradictory objectives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of the age groups, balancing these objectives is not too difficult.&nbsp; But for the very old, especially those above 80, this is simply not feasible.&nbsp; We are making our actuarial consultants earning their consultancy fee by doing many iterations.&nbsp; I want to see whether&nbsp;we can find an optimal&nbsp;point for the&nbsp;trade-offs.&nbsp; But no matter what, the&nbsp;old will have to face a larger premium increase.&nbsp; To help them cope with this, the Government will be topping up the Medisave Accounts of elderly Singaporeans.&nbsp; With this top-up, combined with the MediShield loyalty discount, an affordable package may be possible.&nbsp; I target to finalise the details next month.&nbsp; We will time the Medisave top-ups to precede the implementation of the MediShield reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1701<p>Mdm Halimah suggested that we raise the maximum coverage age for MediShield.&nbsp; It was raised to 85 in 2006.&nbsp; We will review this periodically.&nbsp; But we do need time to gather more local data to correctly establish the premiums for those in higher age groups, taking into account the prevailing life expectancy.&nbsp; Later, during clarification time, if Mdm Halimah would like to, we can have some discussions over this very difficult topic.&nbsp; It is not simple.&nbsp; It is not straightforward like, \"Let us just raise the maximum age.\"&nbsp; It has to do with critical size, ie, the size of the risk pool.&nbsp; When the risk pool is too small, the premiums will have to be very high.&nbsp; I have checked the numbers.&nbsp; Those who are more than 80 today, in MediShield, number&nbsp;only a few thousands&nbsp;and they are largely the very sick ones.&nbsp; That is the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, the main strategy to help lower-income Singaporeans cope with rising healthcare cost is our heavy subsidies for Class B2/C patients.&nbsp; At 65% or 80% of cost, these are very large subsidies.&nbsp; Last year, direct subsidy for these patients was $1.5 billion.&nbsp; This year,&nbsp;very&nbsp;likely, it should&nbsp;exceed $1.7 billion.&nbsp; Indeed, the bulk of the budget increase will go towards caring for subsidised patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: who should constitute \"subsidised patients\"?&nbsp; Who are&nbsp;Class B2/C wards created for?&nbsp; I put these questions forward during my public dialogues recently.&nbsp; The vast majority of the participants were clear in their reply:&nbsp; Class B2/C should serve the bottom 20% or at most&nbsp;30% of Singaporeans.&nbsp; In fact, this used to be the case when I started my career in the Ministry of Health exactly 30 years and three days ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we first started, Class C beds were clearly for the poor, at the bottom 10% or 15% of Singaporeans, and they were furnished as such.&nbsp; But over the years, with rising public expectations,&nbsp;we <p align=left>Column: 1702<p>improved Class C wards and services, more lower-middle income patients choose them.&nbsp; Today, the bottom half of Singaporeans form the bulk of Class C and B2 patients.&nbsp; It is now a very different scenario from the days when Class C and B2 wards were first conceived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And budget permitting, I would like to continue to upgrade the subsidised wards in response to rising expectations.&nbsp; But as we raise their service levels and narrow the differences between the subsidised and the private wards, we must expect more and more higher-income Singaporeans to be attracted to them, because there is&nbsp;no barrier to entry.&nbsp; Today, any Singaporean who wants a B2/C ward can just put up their hands and they would be admitted to&nbsp;Class B2/C and they would enjoy&nbsp;the high subsidy.&nbsp; This must mean greater competition for the same health subsidy.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp;rationale why we need to introduce means-testing in the subsidised wards now.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over many dialogues, I have explained this to a good cross-section of Singaporeans.&nbsp; The concerns raised by various MPs&nbsp;were similar to those I have heard during the dialogues.&nbsp; I am heartened by the people's understanding and support for this policy, after hearing my explanation and clarification.&nbsp; I have assured Singaporeans - and I give them my word - that we will take a practical approach to means-testing.&nbsp; We will be flexible at the margins to help those who may appear to be&nbsp;high-income but who may have exceptional financial liabilities, either because of large families or maybe some family members with congenital complex illnesses.&nbsp; We have decided to set the criteria more loosely so as to mitigate the impact on those who may be affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clerk of Parliament will now distribute the parameters which will define our means-testing framework.&nbsp; [<I>Copies of <p align=left>Column: 1703<p>Annex A* distributed to hon. Members.</I> ]&nbsp; Please refer to Annex A of the handout.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notice that the criteria and income thresholds are more generous than was discussed during the public dialogues.&nbsp; As Members can see, the vast majority of patients will not be affected by means-testing.&nbsp; All those who earn below $3,200 per month - individual income, not household income -&nbsp;will continue to enjoy the full subsidy.&nbsp; All housewives, retirees and children, in other words, non-working,&nbsp;living in HDB flats and lower-Annual Value private properties will similarly be unaffected.&nbsp; We have taken such an approach after taking into account the feedback from several MPs, including Mdm Halimah, Dr Amy Khor, Dr Lam Pin Min, Ms Jessica Tan, Dr Maliki, Dr Fatimah Lateef and Mayor Zainudin, who have helped me to conduct some of the public dialogues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked if means-testing will deter the higher-income patients from continuing to use B2/C.&nbsp; I will not be able to forecast how individual patients will respond to the change.&nbsp; But what I hope will happen is a greater awareness on the part of Singaporeans that we all should subscribe to MediShield, and that those who earn more than, say, $3,000 or $4,000 per month, should top up with a rider which would enable them to use the higher ward classes.&nbsp; And if they do so,&nbsp;there is no reason for them to go to&nbsp;Class B2/C to&nbsp;compete with the poor&nbsp;patients.&nbsp; So, this means-testing is as much about getting Singaporeans to get a proper level of medical insurance.&nbsp; That, to me, is the key motivation and a very important motivation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong suggested even more subsidy, higher than 80%, for the very needy patients.&nbsp; In fact, we do so today.</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\"><p>*Cols. 1797-1798.</p>\r\n<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Many end up paying nothing&nbsp;- we just waive the whole bill&nbsp;- which means a subsidy of 100%.&nbsp; But, of course,&nbsp;they have to be properly means-tested.&nbsp; So there is nothing wrong with the concept of means-testing in healthcare at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">3.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now working out the implementation details and we are confident that implementation can be automated and hassle-free.&nbsp; Like Mdm Ho Geok Choo, we want to keep the cost of implementation low.&nbsp; Some cost in computerisation has to be incurred, but the incremental cost should be manageable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mdm Halimah that we should simplify implementation.&nbsp; That is why we adopt a simplified approach to means-testing, just by looking at personal income, rather than per capita household income.&nbsp; I agree totally with Mdm Ho, Ms Denise Phua&nbsp;and Mr Siew Kum Hong that per capita household income is a more correct gauge of financial ability, but implementing such a scheme for acute hospitals with very high turnover, large numbers of patients, short stay,&nbsp;will be&nbsp;extremely costly and, of course,&nbsp;intrusive to every patient, when the majority will actually not be affected by means-testing.&nbsp; So you are subjecting people to a lot of hassle for nothing.&nbsp; However, if specific patients feel that the simplified approach has been&nbsp;unfair to them, we will then do a thorough means-testing on such patients upon their appeal.&nbsp; So, in a way it is a hybrid system, a simplified approach -&nbsp;a first cut for everybody - and for those who feel aggrieved, we will look at them individually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong asked: why not have this seemingly better means-testing approach extended to the stepdown care?&nbsp; He comes from the stepdown care sector, <p align=left>Column: 1705<p>so he knows how intrusive this more correct per capita approach is, which Mr Siew Kum Hong and a few others are advocating.&nbsp; It is troublesome, but I do not believe that there should be one common formula that applies across the board, for the simple reason: what are we trying to achieve?&nbsp; We&nbsp;are trying to make sure that fees are affordable to different income groups.&nbsp; And whether fees are affordable or not depends on what is the quantum of the fee.&nbsp; If it is just $10, $20, or&nbsp;less than $100, it is quite different from if it were a few hundred&nbsp;or a few thousand dollars.&nbsp; And I generally would err on the side of generosity for large bills. &nbsp;That is why, although we&nbsp;say Class C ward subsidy is 80%,&nbsp;in ICU, the subsidy actually&nbsp;is way above 95%, as a rule, because I know very few people, except Bill Gates, can afford unsubsidised ICU charges.&nbsp; And that is also why regularly, when patients get into serious trouble in private hospitals who requires prolonged ICU stay, especially babies, neo-natal premature babies, we take them, because we know they just cannot afford those charges unsubsidised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;any standard approach to means-testing that is applied across the board, may get&nbsp;the patients&nbsp;into trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;The charges will then be either&nbsp;too high for many or unnecessarily low for those with small bills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang made some comments about means-testing.&nbsp; He mentioned it during the last General Election, which is true.&nbsp;&nbsp;The media approached me and&nbsp;I gave my reply&nbsp;and said, \"Yes,&nbsp;it is not urgent on my agenda\".&nbsp; That was&nbsp;the last GE&nbsp;in 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;I said it was not urgent on my agenda because I had got so many urgent issues to do and I listed some of them: I wanted to further reform Medisave&nbsp;for out-patients and I wanted to reform the MediShield to allow a larger payout.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those were the urgent issues that&nbsp;I wanted to do and they were hot on&nbsp;top of my head.&nbsp; So I said, \"Well, at some stage, <p align=left>Column: 1706<p>we will probably do means-testing but it is certainly not urgent (then).\"&nbsp; I think I might have even offered an answer to say that I do not see myself implementing it during the first year.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in&nbsp;2006, and \"the first year\" would have been 2007;&nbsp;this is now the second year, 2008.&nbsp; And we have decided that we will implement the simplified approach as set out in Annex A in January 2009.&nbsp; So I have not contradicted what I said during the GE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made a second point, which is that means testing is unfair because you would then deprive Singaporeans of choices.&nbsp; Are we?&nbsp; Are we depriving them of choices?&nbsp; I am not saying that if you are in the higher income group,&nbsp;middle or upper middle income group, you cannot access Class C wards.&nbsp; Nobody said that.&nbsp; If you look at Annex A carefully, everybody,&nbsp;so long as you are a Singaporean, put up your hand,&nbsp;if you want Class C wards, you&nbsp;may be admitted to Class C ward.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we are saying is that&nbsp;it is fair of you, because of your high income, that your subsidy does not have to be as high as somebody who is earning a fraction of your income.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the finalised subsidy rate, it is still a very heavy subsidy.&nbsp; So somebody earning $10,000 a month, high income group, if he insisted on going to Class C,&nbsp;we will treat him there and the subsidy is 65%.&nbsp; So he only needs to pay one-third of our cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a thorough man.&nbsp; We went through several rounds of simulation of bills to assess the high income patients: their Medisave balances and the bill sizes, not only average but also 90th percentile&nbsp;large bills.&nbsp; And I can confidently say that, despite the reduced subsidy for the upper middle income group who&nbsp;go to Class C, it is totally affordable.&nbsp; In fact, if their medical conditions are not serious, they do not even need to use their MediShield, their Medisave will be able to pay for it.&nbsp; Even basic MediShield without rider, they <p align=left>Column: 1707<p>could pay for it, without having to pay out of pocket, and this is what I expect largely will happen when we implement it early next year.&nbsp; So, bills will remain totally affordable to all different income groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we are asking Singaporeans is: if you are lucky, you belong to&nbsp;the higher income group, perhaps you should accept a lower subsidy than those who are much poorer than you.&nbsp; And, better still, check your CPF statement: have you bought MediShield?&nbsp; If you do not have MediShield, please subscribe to one and, if you are earning more than $4,000 per month, please, buy a rider immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng mentioned C Class ward as he is unhappy with the title \"C\", because <I>Hokkien</I> means \"dead\" or \"dying\".&nbsp; This is not the first time that we named it as Class C: it has been around for&nbsp;40-odd years.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;this is the first time I received such a feedback.&nbsp; We are not using it for means testing to scare away people from Class C!&nbsp; If anything, the Class C ward is over-crowded and there are many patients who do not mind this.&nbsp; But I thought most patients, if their relatives asked,&nbsp;will talk about their ward number, eg, ward 32 or ward 36.&nbsp; They really do not&nbsp;ask in terms of&nbsp;whether they are in a Class A or&nbsp;Class B ward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Budget will raise our heath spending to a new level.&nbsp; It will improve clinical care and go towards meeting part of the higher public expectations for shorter waiting time.&nbsp; It will raise cost for both patients and the society.&nbsp; We should be mindful that this does not trigger further expectations, and here on this point, I totally agree with Ms Sylvia Lim, and hence greater cost escalation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing expectations and moderating expectations require&nbsp;full understanding&nbsp;by Singaporeans.&nbsp; At the clinical level, what is standard healthcare can be <p align=left>Column: 1708<p>more objectively determined.&nbsp; There are established norms for, say, how diabetes ought to be managed, how speedily heart attacks ought to be handled.&nbsp; To keep cost affordable, we have experts who advise us on what constitutes standard care, what constitute standard drugs and what are non-standard.&nbsp; And&nbsp;if patients demand non-standard treatment when standard medicine or appliances are available, we will have to ask them to pay for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for the non-clinical aspects of healthcare, say, the number of days or weeks of waiting by non-emergency patients for a new clinic appointment or waiting time to see a doctor at the clinic, clinical care is unaffected by improvements in such service standard.&nbsp; If such enhancement is pursued too vigorously by Singaporeans, it must lead to huge increases in health spending.&nbsp; We have to be cautious on this front.&nbsp; Our 19% increase in health spending this year will bring about some enhancement in such non-clinical service standard, but we should be realistic that it will not be on-demand service like what you get in five-star or even four-star hotels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will do my part to ensure that Singaporeans will continue to enjoy healthcare that is among the best anywhere in the world.&nbsp; But higher spending often does not guarantee better health.&nbsp; Indeed, as noted by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, it is the basics that we must continue to focus on which will bring about healthcare improvement: prevention and better management of chronic diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as an example, please refer to Annex B of the earlier handout.&nbsp; It shows the rapidly-growing obesity problem in the US and in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;The colour&nbsp;chart: as the colour&nbsp;darkens, it means that the population there is getting more obese.&nbsp; As Asia modernises and embraces fast food, we will not be spared.&nbsp; Obesity is <p align=left>Column: 1709<p>becoming a global epidemic.&nbsp; In terms of human cost, it is worse than SARS.&nbsp; It will kill many more but in a silent way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans like to eat, so we are vulnerable.&nbsp; We are not yet&nbsp;as obese as the Americans or Europeans, but we may soon be, if we are not careful.&nbsp; If you look at the chart: how quickly a population can become obese within&nbsp;10 years,&nbsp;15 years.&nbsp; After cigarettes, obesity is the most important cause of global mortality and morbidity, and like cigarettes, it is preventable.&nbsp; We did a good job fighting cigarettes and our smokers&rsquo; rate is among the lowest in the world.&nbsp; We should try to beat obesity like we beat smoking.&nbsp; We must win this war against obesity and, yes, we can!</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Kalyani K Mehta (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Chairman, the concept of age-friendly primary health care was developed by the World Health Organisation in 2002.&nbsp; An international research was conducted using focus group methodology in the following countries - Australia, Canada, Jamaica, Malaysia and the Philippines.&nbsp; According to their report, which I have here, published in 2004, <I>Active Ageing Towards Age-Friendly Primary Health Care</I>, the general principles guiding the practice of age-friendly community-based practice were described in detail.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore participated in the second half of the study when doctors and nurses were interviewed for their views.&nbsp; The Tsao Foundation represented Singapore in this study.&nbsp; There are three major categories included in these general principles:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Information, education and training.&nbsp;&nbsp; All clinical staff should receive basic training in core competencies of elder care;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Community-based health care management.&nbsp;&nbsp; All relevant stakeholders, <p align=left>Column: 1713<p>including older persons, should be part of participatory decision-making mechanisms regarding the organisation of committee-based care systems; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Physical environment, safe and affordable transport to the health care centre should be available for all, including older persons whenever possible, by using a variety of community-based resources, including volunteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The importance of primary health care in an ageing society today is an under discussed topic, especially at national levels.&nbsp; Global ageing has shown the prevalence of chronic diseases over infectious diseases.&nbsp; World wide, it is estimated that 60% of all deaths are attributed to chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, stroke and dementia.&nbsp; Compared to neighbouring countries, Singapore has a higher prevalence of diabetes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, recently, an expert in geriatrics, Prof. Bergman, visited Singapore, and he said in one of his presentations that \"the daunting challenges of adopting health care systems to the complexity of managing and tracking chronic diseases requires a multi-dimensional approach.&nbsp; More resources have to be pumped into&nbsp;primary health care as prevention is better than cure.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;His opinion was that the Singapore primary health care system is fragmented and could be strengthened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary health care system in Singapore consists of ageing polyclinics and GPs.&nbsp; The private GPs handle 80% of the bulk of primary care while polyclinics handle the rest.&nbsp; Other players are the community-based day rehabilitation centres, mobile health clinics, senior activities centres and free clinics run by religious and ethnic-based organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HPB has done many programmes, such as oral health promotion and so on.&nbsp; However, preventive education is a <p align=left>Column: 1714<p>marathon task.&nbsp; Hence, it has to be undertaken by all the players in the primary health care system in a planned and systematic manner.&nbsp; Since MOH is the central policy making body, it is important for MOH to ensure that all the players move in a similar direction for preventive health care as we are facing an ageing population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I move on to another study conducted in Singapore, and I would like to declare my interest here as a principal investigator of this research.&nbsp; Older people and care givers were asked about their views on the primary health care system, and their suggestions for improvements.&nbsp; This primary care study revealed barriers faced by older persons in accessing health services.&nbsp; These were: (1) distance - here, primary care partnership scheme helps but it has many conditions; (2) cost; and (3) physical access.&nbsp; The last was emphasised by frail, dependent and physically disabled elders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recommendations included shorter waiting time, choice to see the same doctor on every visit to the polyclinic.&nbsp; The recent move by MOH to introduce the scheme of family physicians does meet the last recommendation to some extent.&nbsp; However, the increase in cost is a barrier to many.&nbsp; Sir, I wish to ask the reason for this extra charge.&nbsp; Is it really necessary?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctors and nurses mentioned two main issues.&nbsp; Doctors who were interviewed expressed their focus on curative medicine rather than preventive medicine.&nbsp; They regretted that they did not have more time to spend with older patients due to the work load at polyclinics.&nbsp; The social workers and case managers voiced the lack of integration between health and social care services.&nbsp; An example: community health care providers could not access medical data of patients.&nbsp; Hence, the delay in helping clients in critical conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1715<p> Some suggested solutions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Assign older patients to a particular day in the week for polyclinics, eg, Fridays.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that there is a pilot scheme in Delhi doing this, and realistically rostering their appointment times, such as 10 minutes or 15 minutes instead of the standard&nbsp;five minutes; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Obtain the permission from patients to share their medical data with community-based health care providers for an added level of efficiency in meeting their needs.&nbsp; It would mean time saved and less frustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Health Minister whether MOH has any plans to promote age-friendly practices in the polyclinics.&nbsp; There are older persons who cannot keep an appointment because they have no one to escort them.&nbsp; I would like to suggest perhaps a resource help line to be maintained by polyclinics.&nbsp; If a patient calls, say, two days ahead of time that he or she needs such an escort, a health senior volunteer from a nearby senior activities centre could provide the service with a small transport allowance.&nbsp; In addition, not all polyclinics are accessible to wheelchair-bound patients, eg, Clementi Polyclinic.&nbsp; Can I request the Health Minister to look into this important issue?&nbsp; Addressing this barrier could lead to more&nbsp;elderly patients keeping their appointments as well as disabled patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would recommend that the holistic approach be adopted to ensure an integrated age-friendly health care system, looking at hardware and software that prevail in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term gerontology training could be given to all staff in community-based agencies serving older people in the community.&nbsp; This would help them understand the needs of older people and appreciate their strength.&nbsp; With technology, such a training <p align=left>Column: 1716<p>could be even done on a website, and GPs could be encouraged to also do this training.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is further exacerbated by the limited access to Medisave for home-based medical care.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to rethink the current strategy as it seems to be designed at keeping the elderly in the hospital rather than at home, as it disincentivises those who opt for home-based care.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking care of a sick elderly person is a serious physical, emotional and financial strain on families, particularly for those with limited resources.&nbsp; Small wonder then that we often hear that the elderly occupy a lot more of the subsidised hospital beds and also stay long, which is a cost to our society because hospital care is expensive.&nbsp; Although one may argue that the elderly stay longer in hospital because they are sicker, it could also be because families with little support at home drag their feet in bringing home their elderly relatives.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to consider granting subsidies for home-based care of the elderly, so as to ease the burden of families and to help to keep more of the chronic sick at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Extend Subsidies for Treatment at Private GP Clinics</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, I now move on to my second cut.&nbsp; Judging from the long queues, polyclinics are finding it difficult to cope with the increasing number of patients. The problem&nbsp;will not go away even if we build more clinics and deploy more manpower.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1717<p>Conversely, an SMA survey shows that GPs now have fewer&nbsp;patients and face higher costs, forcing some GPs into aesthetic medicine resulting in 20 of them being scrutinised by the Ministry arising from complaints of botched cosmetic jobs.&nbsp; This is the kind of supply generated medical service that we can do without, as it causes health care expenditure to balloon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On average, a doctor in a big polyclinic sees about 62 patients per day, which is much higher than the average of 40 patients per day at a busy private GP clinic.&nbsp; From a national perspective, this mismatch in capacity and demand between polyclinics and GPs is&nbsp;an inefficient allocation of resources.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry to consider allowing GPs to claim the same amount of subsidies for treating subsidised patients as that given to polyclinics, subject, of course, to conditions or protocols to prevent abuse.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The rate of population ageing in Singapore is among the fastest in the world.&nbsp; The elderly will use between three and five times more healthcare services compared to the younger population.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the 3Ms are intended to increasingly cover&nbsp;a larger share of the health financing pie, the fact remains that they cover only less than half of overall national expenditure at present, leaving still a large portion of expense as out-of-pocket payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, any reduction in healthcare cost will lessen an individual's cost substantially.&nbsp; Could MOH look into the policy of reducing the burden of healthcare of Singaporeans in the following areas:\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Promoting active elderly citizenry based on Okinawa's population on healthy living;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Sir, last week, I came across an article with a seductive promise: \"Five easy steps to living long and well\".&nbsp; It is a serious article quoting the evidence gathered from a study on more than 2,300 healthy men over many years.&nbsp; When the study began in 1981, their average age was 72.&nbsp; At the end of the study, 970 men or 41% had survived into their 90s.&nbsp; The study was published last month in <I>The Archives of Internal Medicine.</I> &nbsp; \"The take-home message\", said Dr Laurel Yates, a geriatrician at Brigham and Women's Hospital who led the study, \"is that an individual does have some control over his destiny in terms of what he can do to improve the probability <p align=left>Column: 1720<p>that not only might he live a long time, but also have good health and good function in those older years.\"\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prescribed&nbsp;five easy steps are: abstain from smoking, manage weight, control blood pressure, regular exercise and avoid diabetes.&nbsp; I score 5 out of 5, but I believe that good genes and good <I>karma</I> play an important part too.&nbsp; The study focused on men but the prescription is probably applicable to women as well.&nbsp; In fact, in the same issue of the journal I read another study which monitored 500 women and 200 men ranging in age from 97&nbsp;&ndash; so the youngest was 97 &ndash; &nbsp;to 119.&nbsp;&nbsp; This study showed that a large proportion of people who lived that long, with minimal or no assistance, did so despite long-term chronic illnesses.&nbsp; In other words, some of the oldest of the old survive not because they avoid illness, but because they were able to delay or even prevent disability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As life expectancy grows, there will be many more such studies and articles.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo mentioned Okinawa and&nbsp;how they deal&nbsp;with longevity.&nbsp; I went there last year and I spent several days there.&nbsp; I visited a village called <I>Ogimi</I> with 3,500 villagers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventeen of them are above the age of 100: 16 female, one male. And the man, with dementia, lying in a nursing home, I visited him.&nbsp; I have never, in one sitting, met so many over-90 years of age, mostly ladies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have met many Singaporeans in similar age groups here, but they are largely in nursing homes&nbsp;or chronic sick hospitals.&nbsp; The Okinawans&nbsp;are different.&nbsp; They are active,&nbsp;they are busy, they are happy, fun loving.&nbsp; I did folk-dancing with them. And they&nbsp;live independently. They still cook their own meals.&nbsp;Very few are bed-ridden in nursing homes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they do have nursing homes&nbsp;there&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but when I spoke to them, they&nbsp;said they came from other villages, not from this&nbsp;village.&nbsp; And they were quick to share their secrets <p align=left>Column: 1721<p>with me.&nbsp; Less scientific and more anecdotal, their prescription is:&nbsp;sleep well, meaning have a good night's sleep, not necessarily at night,&nbsp;it&nbsp;could be during the day, but have a good sleep.&nbsp; Be happy, eat lots of vegetables, very important,&nbsp;and they eat fruits too, but they treat fruits like vegetables, they cook their&nbsp;fruits into their dishes&nbsp;and, of course, stay active.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are some positive aspects of ageing.&nbsp; But ageing of the population is not all bed of roses.&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min's comment on dementia is just one illustration.&nbsp; Indeed, the ageing of the population is the greatest challenge confronting healthcare systems around the world.&nbsp; Just look at the US.&nbsp; They&nbsp;spent 16% of their GDP on healthcare and you look at the component called Medicare which funds the medical care of the elderly, anybody more than 65 years, that&nbsp;takes up 3% of the US GDP. So 3% of US GDP just to look after those who are more than 65, and we spent 4% treating everybody.&nbsp; And one quarter of Medicare spending goes towards supporting the&nbsp;last year of &nbsp;the patients' lives. And, of course, this naturally raises many questions about the appropriateness of such spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason is that current healthcare systems largely skew the practice of medicine towards high-tech medicine,&nbsp;a point Prof. Mehta&nbsp;made just now, and therefore&nbsp;at great financial cost and often&nbsp;poor quality of life for the patients.&nbsp;Someone&nbsp;showed me this book,&nbsp;\"Slow Medicine\"&nbsp;written by a geriatrician&nbsp;at Dartmouth Medical School. He promotes a different approach and I quote him,&nbsp;\"a family-centred, less expensive way\", as he puts it.&nbsp; He felt that for many elderly patients, \"modern medicine in its hospital-based, medication-obsessed, high-tech impersonality may hurt more than it helps\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has many practical tips for children of elderly parents and they are worth <p align=left>Column: 1722<p>sharing.&nbsp; First, while the parent is still vital and lively, children must not fool themselves that this happy situation will last forever.&nbsp; This is the time to re-insert themselves back into the parent's life, to accompany them to doctors' visits, and at the right moment raise unpleasant topics like the advanced medical directive or living will.&nbsp; And I see a cut on this by&nbsp;a Member later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few more years,&nbsp;this&nbsp;geriatrician&nbsp;said, it is time for the children to address the \"can you still manage at home?\"&nbsp;issues and to help create routines that compensate for the elderly's slipping memory and slightly wobbly balance.&nbsp; And then, inevitably, medical crises will&nbsp;arise.&nbsp; The children should then be vigilant to protect and \"rescue the elderly from standard medical care\".&nbsp; By that, he meant medical care should, all the while, favour the tried-and-true, over the high-tech.&nbsp; For example, instead of a yearly mammogram, a manual breast examination for the very old may suffice.&nbsp; And home tests for blood in the stool may replace the draining routine of a colonoscopy.&nbsp; Very practical tips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He added that the pace of care should be slowed to a crawl, and hence the title of his book.&nbsp; For doctors, that means starting the medications at low dosage and increasing them gradually.&nbsp; And for children, that means learning not to panic and yell for an ambulance on every apparent bad day. Though both comforting and worrying, it is a valuable contribution to the global discussion on ageing and how best should families cope with it.<br>\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, modern healthcare systems are not well-designed for the demands of ageing.&nbsp; They are geared towards acute care in hospitals, that is, treatment for only brief but severe episodes of illness, sometimes requiring high-tech care.&nbsp; But insufficient thought has been given to long-term chronic care.&nbsp; Good models are <p align=left>Column: 1723<p>rare and far-between anywhere in the world.&nbsp; Proper chronic care should be carefully designed for the long term, with appropriate level of resources, usually low-tech care, and most critically with strong cooperation, participation&nbsp;by patients and their families.&nbsp; Chronic care is a very different care regime from acute care.&nbsp; But when high-tech acute care is mindlessly extrapolated to cover long-term chronic care for the elderly, it is not at all surprising that problems in the US and&nbsp;the&nbsp;West&nbsp;have arisen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone is searching for a better model to handle long-term chronic care of the elderly.&nbsp; We too are evolving our model.&nbsp; So I agree with Mdm Halimah that there are gaps, many in our current step-down care sector, and we must fix them.&nbsp; Fixing them, however, requires careful thought.&nbsp; Some elements or operating philosophies are better researched and appear sound, but we cannot be sure until they are tested through time and actual experience.&nbsp; This calls for carefully-planned experimentation and small-scale pilots, close monitoring and review, and if proven, scaling up.&nbsp; Such initiatives include, among many others:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;Greater emphasis on preventive medicine;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;Better management of chronic diseases at outpatient level;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;Better integration of care between hospitals and step-down care facilities; and<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;Right-siting of patient care in more appropriate and lower-cost settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members have shared their thoughts on this important subject and I thank them.&nbsp; I have noted Dr Lily Neo's comments on possible public-private-<p align=left>Column: 1724<p>people partnership as a model of providing eldercare.&nbsp; And indeed, we should widen participation, both in provision as well as in funding.&nbsp; Ageing of the population is a growing problem, and we should not underestimate its impact.&nbsp; The Japanese are well-known for doing very careful research and wide consultation before they launch any&nbsp;new scheme.&nbsp; Yet, when they launched their national long-term insurance scheme just a few years ago, they found that their initial projection of demand and funding needs were off by a wide margin,&nbsp;just after one year of implementation!&nbsp; They have since been trying to curtail demand and raise premiums.&nbsp; I think this is a very &nbsp;important lesson for us who are involved in the planning of eldercare services.&nbsp; Do not underestimate&nbsp; demand, especially if it is going to be subsidised generously.&nbsp; And make a strong distinction between demand and what is genuine need. Demand does not equal need. If service is provided, heavily subsidised or provided for free, demand will grow, much more than&nbsp;the actual need. Better think through, start small, test the market, rather than rashly committing to any long-term financing that our society may not be in a position to afford.&nbsp;Let us discuss some of the points raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I agree with Dr Lily Neo that we must promote healthy living and healthy ageing.&nbsp; But Singaporeans must participate actively in order to benefit.&nbsp; This is a continuous and often uphill endeavour.&nbsp; But we persevere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthy living starts with awareness.&nbsp; This year, HPB will roll out the nurse educator programme. This is a new programme which we are starting. We will place some of these nurse educators at community centres where they can hold classes for patients and their families on how to manage their chronic conditions. We will work with PA and the grassroots to promote these programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1725<p> We will leverage on screening.&nbsp; Many MPs, I remember during the early&nbsp;years Dr Lily Neo actively championed community screening,&nbsp;and a lot of work has been done promoting this.&nbsp; We are consolidating the programme and we will raise it to a new level.&nbsp; From this year, HPB will roll out what we call an Integrated Screening Programme.&nbsp; All Singaporeans above the age of 40 will receive a letter from us, a reminder to go for screening for some of the major chronic diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are embarking on preventive efforts to promote healthy ageing.&nbsp; Last year, we embarked on a pilot \"Wellness Programme\" at&nbsp;six constituencies.&nbsp; This came under the framework of the committee chaired by Mr Lim Boon Heng.&nbsp;We are trying out at six constituencies, and if it works, we will scale it up. This includes a platform for health agencies and service providers to encourage positive changes in seniors' lifestyles and health behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I agree with Prof. Mehta, that when medical care is needed, primary care is the best first point of contact for the chronically ill and elderly patients, unless of course, it is genuine emergencies. Good primary care is particularly essential to meet the chronic disease challenge.&nbsp;Medisave can now be used for outpatient treatment of&nbsp;four chronic diseases.&nbsp; As noted by Dr Fatimah, half of GP clinics are now participating in this scheme.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, we are pleased with the progress.&nbsp; So, from next month, we will extend the scheme to the remaining two major chronic diseases:&nbsp;&nbsp;asthma and&nbsp;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we will extend it under&nbsp;similar terms.&nbsp; This will benefit up to 180,000 more Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1726<p> Dr Fatimah asked if we would extend this scheme to other illnesses, for example, mental illness.&nbsp; We keep our options open,&nbsp;but for the moment, we focus on the key chronic diseases with established treatment protocol and measurable clinical outcomes.&nbsp; We also must not forget that Medisave at current contribution rates&nbsp;are only designed for inpatient care.&nbsp; It was never designed for outpatient care.&nbsp; Extension to expensive outpatient care is an exception, and we should resist any temptation to broaden its use liberally, or it will surely be depleted prematurely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah proposed that we extend&nbsp;the Primary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS) to cover some chronic diseases.&nbsp; Currently, it does not.&nbsp; It only covers acute care, coughs and colds, but chronic care, it does not.&nbsp; Any extension to chronic care will raise the risk of over-consumption and over-servicing.&nbsp; But a case for extension can be made if we can manage the potential problem of abuse.&nbsp; So I am studying this very carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min and Dr Fatimah described the problems faced by caregivers of patients with dementia.&nbsp; And it is a real problem.&nbsp; Talking to them in nursing homes, you cannot help not to&nbsp;be affected when the loved one can no longer recognise them.&nbsp; Sometimes, it is easy for outsiders to say, \"You terrible children: never visit your parents in the nursing home after dumping them there.\"&nbsp; But when you go there, one month, two months, three months and then six months, the patient cannot recognise you at all.&nbsp; It is heartwrenching.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for caregivers, we will try to support them as much as we can in a professional way, in a technical way, how to cope with all these difficult problems, forming them into support groups so that they can support each other.&nbsp; But whether we should pay them, I think let us think <p align=left>Column: 1727<p>through this carefully.&nbsp; This is part and parcel of the children's duty, this is family duty.&nbsp; I think if the Government steps in to turn children into employees,&nbsp;we are walking backwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, I agree with Mdm Halimah, Dr Lily Neo and Dr Fatimah that we must better integrate the healthcare system with the community to provide appropriate care for the elderly.&nbsp; From next month, we will upgrade the Integrated Care Services into what we call Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)&nbsp;with upgraded capabilities.&nbsp; Starting with Changi Hospital and National University Hospital,&nbsp;the AIC will equip our hospitals with additional resources, including additional care coordinators.&nbsp; This will cost us $20 million over the next four years.&nbsp; These coordinators will help ensure that patients who are fit for discharge but, who have multiple complex care needs, are transferred to appropriate step-down care providers and that they will receive the necessary medical or social services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another key focus for MOH is to ensure patients get the most appropriate treatment in the right place, or what we call \"right-siting\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah and Dr Lily Neo suggested&nbsp;that we subsidise home-based care for the elderly, including home hospice care.&nbsp; I think we do but of course we can always do more.&nbsp; But we have to study the implications: what does it mean?&nbsp; Last year, the Ministry of Health provided $3 million in funding these providers.&nbsp; We will do more, but we are taking a careful approach,&nbsp;as the direct home care model actually is very expensive.&nbsp; So I am at a dilemma.&nbsp; We know that the elderly prefers to age at home. &nbsp;And to strengthen family bond,&nbsp;treatment should be at home, instead of in an&nbsp;institution even if&nbsp;it is a day-care <p align=left>Column: 1728<p>facility.&nbsp; But between the two, it is a lot cheaper to do it at&nbsp;an institutional level because you can have economies of scale, rather than at home.&nbsp; So these are the balancing acts that we have to do.&nbsp; We need to study the underlying patient needs carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah commented on ElderShield.&nbsp; We have enhanced it last year, as she noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who require more payouts, they can subscribe to supplements.&nbsp; Unfortunately, partly because the product is not an easy product to market and public awareness is not good,&nbsp;only a single percentage point of ElderShield policy holders top up with the ElderShield supplements.&nbsp; But we will study this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course, we will have to expand the step-down care infrastructure.&nbsp; Much of this may be care that is not medical in nature.&nbsp; In fact, in this area, we should be careful that we do not \"over-medicalise\".&nbsp; If it is just simple care, just keep it at that level.&nbsp; We will work&nbsp;with MCYS to see how we can develop new services here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min commented on the manpower strategy to cope with a rapidly ageing population.&nbsp; And I agree with him that the current numbers will not be sufficient.&nbsp; We will study and we will try to increase them.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier speech, I mentioned about wanting to step up the training as well as recruitment of many of these allied health professionals.&nbsp; In this sector, really, they are the most important resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everyone wants to live long and live well, without being a burden to the family.&nbsp; In Okinawa, the ladies told me, when I asked them what is their top wish: <I>\"pokkuri shinu\"</I>.&nbsp; It is a Japanese word.&nbsp; <I>Pokkuri</I> means pop, like bubble that&nbsp;pops.&nbsp; In other words, they want their lives to be like a bubble&nbsp;&ndash; bubbly, active, happy and then, one fine day, in the sleep,&nbsp;just \"pop\" and die in the sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1729<p>My father led such a life.&nbsp; He worked hard, loved the family, had no vices, and one night, in front of the TV, went into a coma and drew the last breath a few hours later.&nbsp; I missed him by an hour because I was not in Penang.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not everyone is so lucky.&nbsp; My mother suffered nearly three years of cancer pain.&nbsp; We had to try high-tech medicine first.&nbsp;When the poor prospects became clear, we went for \"slow medicine\".&nbsp; She was able to die peacefully at home in&nbsp;familiar surroundings.&nbsp; This time round, I was able to return to Penang in time and be there as a loved one passed on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we busy ourselves with our work and our family, we should sometimes take a pause and reflect on how people spend their last moment.&nbsp; Death is not a taboo subject to be left unspoken.&nbsp; In fact, the more we think seriously about death, the more likely we will know how to live life to the fullest and to make each moment&nbsp;and each day the most meaningful possible.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There is also an over reliance on institutional care and insufficient attention given to community-based care, which can play an important role in the treatment and care of mental <p align=left>Column: 1730<p>illness as it helps in the integration of the individual and is less expensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for a review of the current framework and to put in place a more holistic and comprehensive healthcare framework for the treatment of mental illness.&nbsp; I would also like to ask for an update on the $88 million fund that was set up last year.&nbsp; Could the Minister enlighten this House on what was this fund utilised for and how has it benefited and helped to improve the lives of those suffering from mental illness?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, I would like to suggest that the Ministry consider the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;Extend MediShield to cover mental illness;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;Develop more trained manpower such as psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors and medical social workers, to deal with the increasing number of people suffering from mental illness;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;Do more to educate and raise public awareness about mental illness, as a recent study found that one in three people believe that the mentally ill are dangerous and half the population thinks that the public should be protected;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;Expand more community-based step-down care services for the mentally ill to help them re-integrate into society; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;Review the funding support given to VWOs who are running facilities or providing care and support for the mentally ill, such as the Action Group for Mental Illness and those providing residential care, such as the Singapore Association of Mental Health.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, according to some of these associations, there are now more numbers <p align=left>Column: 1731<p>of people being picked up from the streets by the Police and being referred to them because as the population ages, those who are mentally ill are also ageing but, unfortunately, their caregivers are not in a position to take care of them, especially they themselves are growing much older.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, of course, a tremendous strain for caregivers also, as they&nbsp;financially have to take care of the needs of the mentally ill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a resident in my area, for instance, who lives with his mother and only the two of them are living in the house.&nbsp; The son has to go to work and the mother has no one at home to take care of her.&nbsp; And the problem with people with mental illness is that when they feel a bit better, they do not take&nbsp;their medication, and&nbsp;that is when they start having problems.&nbsp; Neighbours begin to complain.&nbsp; But when they speak to the son, he says, \"I have to work.&nbsp; If I don't work, I stay at home to take care of my mother to make sure that she takes her medicine regularly.&nbsp; There will be two mental patients and not one.\"&nbsp; So I think that really points to the fact that we need a lot of support in the community for those suffering from mental illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to urge for more support to be given to caregivers who suffer physically, emotionally and financially in taking care of their loved ones who are mentally ill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It is shocking to note that despite public awareness campaign about the disease, one third of the 705 survey respondents said&nbsp;they believe HIV can be transmitted through&nbsp;mosquito bites and kissing.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of the survey respondents also said they did not know HIV can be transmitted through breast milk.&nbsp; The survey also found that one in 11 people said he or she would not take an HIV test even if being HIV positive was a possibility.&nbsp; The findings of the survey worry me.&nbsp; Knowing how much effort we have put in to educate and create awareness about the disease, there is still so much ignorance about it in the public.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This led me to think about the effectiveness of current healthcare awareness programme and the ones that we held in the past.&nbsp; We have to look at the effectiveness of the current efforts, especially those dealing with health promotion and disease prevention.&nbsp; I know that the Health Promotion Board is currently doing a lot in these areas.&nbsp; But are we actually getting better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, based on what I see on the ground, I also observe that Singaporeans, young and old, are more obese and prone to health problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is obesity preventable, it could lead to multiple other conditions and could place a large burden on healthcare use and cost.&nbsp; We all know that prevention is the key to controlling obesity.&nbsp; Furthermore, the treatment of <p align=left>Column: 1733<p>obesity is often difficult and frustrating to the patient and doctor and if weight loss is difficult, maintaining it is even more difficult.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

While the prevalence of obesity in Singapore has not reached such alarming levels, it is still a matter of concern, as statistics have shown that the prevalence of primary school children with obesity is about 12%-14%.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 32-year study published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> reports that obesity spreads within social circles.&nbsp; Interestingly, we base our idea of appropriate body size on people we trust.&nbsp; We have a 100% increase in our risk of obesity if we have an obese best friend, 44% if our brother is obese, and 37% if&nbsp;our wife is obese.&nbsp; Therefore, the latest doctor's advice is - choose your friends carefully!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our looks-obsessed society, lots of people think that being overweight is only an appearance or aesthetic issue.&nbsp; But being overweight is actually&nbsp;a medical concern because it can seriously affect a person's health, both physically and psychologically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1734<p> The association between obesity and cardiovascular diseases is well established.&nbsp; Other health problems that can affect obese individuals include arthritis, diabetes, depression and lower self-esteem.&nbsp; In addition, European researchers report in a recent study also link obesity with certain cancers, such as thyroid and kidney, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prevention is one of the best strategies to address the long-term effects and high costs of treating the co-morbidities of obesity.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; What measures or programmes are put in place to educate Singaporeans the ill effects of obesity?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Is the Ministry working closely with MOE and MCYS to prevent obesity at its early stage, in the childcare centre and in the schools?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Can the Ministry implement incentives to encourage Singaporeans to stay trim, such as lower premiums for health insurances, something to the likes of no claim bonus in motor insurance?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me switch from fat to sex now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Teenage Abortion</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our teenagers' cavalier attitude towards pre-marital sex is a cause for concern.&nbsp; According to some of the surveys conducted, it is a matter requiring immediate attention.&nbsp; \"It just happened,\" said one teenage girl who engaged in unprotected sex after one drink too many with a casual friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teenagers are adopting a more liberal attitude towards sex.&nbsp; A poll of youngsters between 16 and 23 years found 13% of them were sexually active.&nbsp; A survey conducted by pharmaceutical company Bayer Schering, Pharma Singapore and Youth.sg, an online portal, <p align=left>Column: 1735<p>revealed 23% did not use any form of contraception.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first nine months of last year, 657 young people sought help for sexually-transmitted diseases.&nbsp; In addition, the rising number of teenage abortions strongly suggests that sex education amongst our teenagers is inadequate.&nbsp; Of the 12,000 abortions in 2006, teenage abortion accounts for 11%, with 19 cases performed on girls under the age of 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abortion should not be used as a form of contraceptive.&nbsp; Frequent abortions can result in possible medical complications, such as womb infection, bleeding problems and even sub-fertility.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the increasing number of young people engaging in pre-marital sex has resulted in more teenage abortions, teenage pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sex education has been shown to be&nbsp;effective to correct the ills of pre-marital sex and teenage pregnancies and abortions.&nbsp; Teenagers should be educated on the moral values and virtues of abstinence from pre-marital sex.&nbsp; However, I understand that times have changed and the society and younger Singaporeans take a more liberal view about sex.&nbsp; It is, therefore, more important to educate teenagers on the importance of safe sex.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what additional efforts will be put in place to address the issues of teenage abortions in Singapore, and what indicators or targets will be used to monitor the effectiveness of such initiatives.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This issue is relatively obscure, and for good reason.&nbsp; The issue of concern is that many people&nbsp;do not know that there are not enough skin donors in Singapore.&nbsp; Skins are donated when we die and,&nbsp;last year, only one person did so.&nbsp; Every year, the average number of skin donors in Singapore is between two and four people.&nbsp; This is way below other developed countries.&nbsp; For example, Australia has 57 donors in the first eight months of 2007.&nbsp; In the New York metro area alone, there were 173 skin donors in 2006.&nbsp; Each year, up to 20 people in Singapore die because there is not enough skin to save them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, skin is not covered under the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA).&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1737<p>Nurses and doctors have to ask families of the person who has died whether they would like to donate the skin.&nbsp; Very often, they&nbsp;are turned down.&nbsp; Perhaps people are just leery of this topic.&nbsp; They may think that their loved ones will be stripped of all their skin, leaving behind a muscled raw mass for burial.&nbsp; But this is simply not true.&nbsp; For skin donations, doctors shaved about 0.25 mm to 0.4 mm from flat surfaces like the thighs and back.&nbsp;And the body still has a layer of skin remaining.&nbsp; The affected areas will appear slightly pale and, when fully clothed, should not affect the donor's appearance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens to the skin after that?&nbsp; They are harvested in pieces and packed individually.&nbsp; Unlike organs, donated skin can last for a long time.&nbsp; After harvesting, they are frozen at -196 degrees Celsius and can be stored up to five years in this condition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may be wondering why&nbsp;I&nbsp;am talking about this topic.&nbsp; Are skins a matter of life and death?&nbsp; In a word, yes.&nbsp; We would probably remember that, last year, seven Singaporean soldiers were injured in a foreign place when a fighter jet crashed into the room they were in.&nbsp; This accident killed three Singaporeans and injured the rest.&nbsp; One of the injured was flown back to Singapore for treatment.&nbsp; He suffered 45-degree burns on his hands and body.&nbsp; Donor skin probably saved his life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has to import skin from Australia, US and the Netherlands.&nbsp; And Singapore has the only comprehensive burns unit in this region and, in the event of terrorist attacks, we are likely to receive many patients.&nbsp; For example, after the Bali bomb blast in 2002, SGH received and treated 16 patients.&nbsp; After the Jakarta bomb blast in 2004, SGH treated 15 patients.&nbsp; And if the terrorist attacks&nbsp;had happened in Singapore, the number of patients would be much, much higher.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1738<p> Sir, it is time that we took greater note of this medical resource and encourage Singaporeans to donate their skin on death.&nbsp; I myself have signed up and pledged my skin to be used after my death.&nbsp; And I will take this as a final spa treatment before embarking on the next journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like organs, skins are truly a gift of life to our fellow human beings.&nbsp; I hope that one day it can be included in HOTA when the idea of skin donation has become much more widely accepted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to continue my speech in Mandarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080303/20080303VS_123113.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I> *.] Sir, first let me quote a Chinese saying:&nbsp; \"&#20154;&#27515;&#30041;&#21517;&#65292;&#35961;&#27515;&#30041;&#30382;\".&nbsp; It means that when a man dies, he leaves behind a good name, a leopard leaves behind its skin. I would like to ask:&nbsp; why can a man not leave behind his skin when he dies?&nbsp; In Singapore, we have almost about 20 burns victims dying of complications every year and, many times, these victims die because they are not able to undergo skin transplantation.&nbsp; Every year, the Singapore General Hospital's Burns Unit treats about 300 burns patients.&nbsp; These victims are warded because of industrial or family accidents.&nbsp; About 15% of the patients suffer extensive burns and 30%-40% of the bodies are severely burnt.&nbsp; So, if these patients do not receive skin transplants, their lives would be in great danger.&nbsp; We often say that money is not everything.&nbsp; We do not bring it to this world when we are born, therefore, we cannot bring it with us when we die.&nbsp; This is the same for our physical body.&nbsp; Therefore, why not treat it as a good deed?&nbsp; When we die, leave behind our skin and give it to those who need a skin transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human values are not constant.&nbsp; Our value system changes according to the&nbsp;times.&nbsp; Therefore, in today's context, it is <p align=left>Column: 1739<p>necessary to review our traditional values.&nbsp; The ancients said:&nbsp;\"&#20154;&#27515;&#30041;&#21517;&#65292;&#35961;&#27515;&#30041;&#30382;\".&nbsp; It means that when a man dies, he leaves behind a good name, the leopard leaves behind its skin.&nbsp; So, in today's context, maybe we should consider changing this idiom to \"&#35961;&#27515;&#30041;&#21517;&#65292;&#20154;&#27515;&#30041;&#30382;\"&nbsp;&ndash; when a leopard dies, it leaves behind a good name, a man leaves behind his skin.&nbsp; We say, \"&#25937;&#20154;&#19968;&#21629;&#65292;&#32988;&#36896;&#19971;&#32423;&#28014;&#23648;\"&nbsp;&ndash; to save a life, it is better than building a seven-storey Buddhist pagoda.\"&nbsp; If we can leave behind our skin when we die, it is also a blessing to be able to give and this shows self-reliance and, at the same time, rendering help to others.&nbsp; It is something worthwhile for us to promote in the society.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1807-1808.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The figures are staggering and, to illustrate this clearly, it has been estimated that the amount generated by medical tourism worldwide will amount to about US$92 billion by 2012.&nbsp; Every practitioner in the private medical industry wants a slice of this growing pie.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is no exception.&nbsp; Singapore Medicine was launched five years ago with the goal to attract one million medical tourists by 2012.&nbsp; Our share of the medical tourism market has been steadily climbing too.&nbsp; Achieving our target by 2012 would generate about S$2.4 billion in healthcare expenditure as well as 13,000 jobs.&nbsp; This is good for Singapore in more ways than one.&nbsp; It is also a goal that we can achieve, given the good reputation of the Singapore medical profession, both in the public and private sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as it is, the world is facing a shortage of medical professionals.&nbsp; This <p align=left>Column: 1740<p>has resulted in a brain drain not only between countries but also between the public and private healthcare sectors.&nbsp; Singapore is not spared of this phenomenon as well.&nbsp; It is common knowledge that our professional healthcare givers in the restructured hospitals and polyclinics are usually overworked and some may even conclude that they are under-remunerated.&nbsp; It is thus not surprising to see an exodus of healthcare professionals from the public to private healthcare sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the average Singaporean, with the increased arrival of tourists competing for medical services, they fear that they may be sidelined.&nbsp;

Thus, holistic care for mental illness should, besides institutional care facilities and medication, also include access to behavioural therapy, community facilities and social support services. We believe that this will help patients recover and reintegrate into society faster and better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, therefore, expanding our efforts to inject new capabilities into the community over the next five years.&nbsp; The inter-Ministry working group on Mental Health, chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of&nbsp;Health, is overseeing this.&nbsp; Its efforts include wellness promotion, public education, early detection and treatment, and reintegration into society.&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment and social needs are also examined.&nbsp; In strengthening the links between social care and medical support, we hope to reduce the need for hospitalisation and improve the chances for patients to regain their mental health, and to work and live&nbsp;well within the community and enjoy&nbsp;peace of mind.&nbsp; Let me update the House on four specific areas of improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will strengthen mental health care in the community, with customised approaches for children, youths, adults and the elderly.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are doing this with our partners&nbsp;&ndash; VWOs, and community partners in the workplace and schools.&nbsp; For example, the Adult Community Programme will monitor patients with mental illnesses to ensure compliance with medication and provide psychosocial support to the patient and the family. &nbsp;A network of interested GPs is also&nbsp;being identified and trained to care for patients in the community, and to complement the existing Community Wellness Clinics in polyclinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1742<p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">5.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will press on with public education on mental health, and encourage people to seek treatment earlier.&nbsp; This will help deal with the onset of conditions better.&nbsp; The Mind Your Mind programme, a mental wellness programme for school children, will be expanded to cover tertiary institutions. HPB launched the Workplace Mental Health Programme, &ldquo;Treasure Your Mind&rdquo; (TYM) in October last year, and 95 organisations have registered under the programme.&nbsp; Last year&rsquo;s National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign was centred on having a &ldquo;Healthy Mind, Happy Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; This year, a media campaign will be conducted,&nbsp;focusing on building positive relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will invest more in manpower development for mental health. &nbsp;We will train more psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses and allied health professionals such as psychologists, medical social workers, and occupational therapists by increasing specialist training places and scholarships.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will translate into better care for the patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we will facilitate more research into mental health so that we are able to plan and care for our patients better. &nbsp;The National Mental Health Evaluation Programme, led by researchers from the Institute of Mental Health, seeks to better define the extent of mental disorders in our population, to identify barriers to mental health care in Singapore, and to study social, cultural and economic factors associated with major mental disorders, and then from there to transfer those research findings into treatment and health options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on preventive healthcare.&nbsp; Various Members suggested that we increase the focus on&nbsp;health promotion and preventive healthcare.&nbsp; Mr Zainudin Nordin asked about how we&nbsp;have done in&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1743<p>our level of health in the population.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo is concerned about how we can reduce the time spent in poor health as we live longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are living longer, and we all want to live long and to live&nbsp;well.&nbsp; Thus, it is right that we pay attention to prolonging our healthy years, and shortening the unhealthy ones.&nbsp; Dr Neo noted from the recent article in the <I>Straits Times</I> that Singaporeans on average suffer&nbsp;eight years of poor health. I do&nbsp;wish to clarify that this does not necessarily&nbsp;mean that we spend&nbsp;eight years of our life hospitalised or severely disabled. The figure of&nbsp;eight years refers to the gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy or HALE.&nbsp; HALE is the average number of years of &ldquo;healthy life&rdquo; a person can expect to live. But living in less than full health might be due to illness of varying severity and duration.&nbsp; So it is a broad definition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, the point remains that we must continue to work at increasing our HALE years, so that we may indeed be hale and hearty for as long and as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp; Mr Zainudin Nordin asked about nutrition of Singaporeans. The diet of adult Singaporeans is generally adequate. The mean intakes of energy, protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals of Singaporeans met at least 70% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances levels. &nbsp;Between 1998 and 2004, the proportion of Singaporeans who eat more fruits and vegetables has also increased&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;in the case of food consumption&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;from 20% to 28%, and in the case of vegetables, from 15% to 43%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent MOH study showed that the main causes of ill-health in Singapore, and as pointed out by Dr Lily Neo,&nbsp; are cancers, heart disease, stroke, diabetes <p align=left>Column: 1744<p>and mental disorders.&nbsp; We believe that prevention is the key to reducing ill-health and disability arising from diseases, and we can do it in three ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, by preventing and delaying the onset of illness and disability&nbsp;through a healthy lifestyle&nbsp;like eating well, exercising regularly, not smoking and practising mental wellness and having a good sleep;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, by detecting illness, especially chronic diseases and cancers early, through regular screening; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, by minimising disease complications, through taking medication as prescribed and following up with the doctor promptly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help get the message across to the people, MOH and HPB have done many media campaigns. &nbsp;Examples include the National Healthy Lifestyle Programme, the National Anti-Smoking Programme.&nbsp; Screening programmes such as Breastscreen and Cervicalscreen (for breast cancer and cervical cancer respectively)&nbsp;have also been introduced to facilitate early detection of these cancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole, Singaporeans have become healthier.&nbsp; The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and smoking has fallen. &nbsp; Between 1998 and 2004, the prevalence of hypertension had dropped from 27.3% to&nbsp;24.9% and that for&nbsp;diabetes came&nbsp;down from 9% to 8.2%.&nbsp; The smoking prevalence rate&nbsp;had also decreased from 15.2% in 1998 to 12.6% in&nbsp;2004.&nbsp; So, if you look at these figures, more Singaporeans are&nbsp;adopting healthier lifestyles.&nbsp; The proportion of Singaporeans who exercise regularly, for example, had increased from 17% in 1998 to 25% in 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proportion of women aged 40-69 years who had gone for mammography at least once before had increased from 27% in 1998 to 51% in 2004.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1745<p>Much work lies ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the percentage of our people who exercise regularly at 25%, I think, is still too low.&nbsp; More people should be exercising.&nbsp; And if you think that&nbsp;one in&nbsp;eight of the population still smoke, then, again, there is more to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, about half of our diabetic population did not know that they had diabetes, and about 40% of hypertensive people did not know they had hypertension. About&nbsp;one in&nbsp;four diabetics had poor blood sugar control and&nbsp;one in&nbsp;two hypertensives had sub-optimal control of blood pressure.&nbsp; So we must press on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, we used mass media messaging and in recent years, we moved to more segmented messaging focus.&nbsp; For example, we partnered community stakeholders to bring across messages about anti-smoking. &nbsp;We also customised programmes for specific target groups.&nbsp;As an example, we targeted young women in our anti-smoking campaign through messages about how smoking causes accelerated ageing.&nbsp; As a further example, &ldquo;kebayarobics&rdquo; was an exercise programme developed for Malay women. So&nbsp;moving forward, we hope to individualise these messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;With these examples and the experiences, and the more&nbsp;we can focus and individualise, we believe that we can reach out better and be able to get the message across and affect behaviour more.&nbsp; The earlier example&nbsp;of the nurse health educator programme which the Minister mentioned&nbsp;provides individualised health messages on diet and physical activity. In addition, HPB is developing an online health portal that sends specific advice to individuals based on their submitted health details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on obesity.&nbsp; We share Dr Lam and Mr Zainudin&rsquo;s concerns about obesity. The prevalence of obesity among adult Singaporeans is rising.&nbsp; It increased from 5.1% in 1992 to 6.9% in the year&nbsp;2004.&nbsp; Obese people are more at risk to diseases such as diabetes and heart attacks. &nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1746<p>Although our rates are still lower than those in many developed countries (and they have reached double digit figures),&nbsp;their experience has shown that obesity rates can increase very quickly, as could be seen&nbsp;from the chart just now.&nbsp; Therefore, we must act early to contain the deterioration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been promoting healthy eating and physical activity for many years. Together with MOE, HPB implemented school-based programmes to control obesity, such as the model school tuck-shop programme which provides healthier food choices in school tuck-shops.&nbsp; The other measures were targeted physical activity programmes and also referring children who are severely overweight for medical assessment and management. The total proportion of overweight and obese students (ie, overweight plus obese together) in the&nbsp;primary and secondary schools and junior colleges&nbsp;fell from 11.1% in 1994 to 9.5% in 2007. &nbsp;So, that broad category of overweight plus obese fell.&nbsp; Unfortunately, within that encouraging drop, the percentage of obese students increased from 2.8% in 1994 to 3.6% in 2007.&nbsp; HPB will continue to work closely with MOE to address this issue through various initiatives such as the counselling and medical referral programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For adults, we will strengthen current efforts to prevent obesity through promoting regular exercise and healthy diets. We will also create a supportive environment by increasing the availability of reduced-energy and healthier foods in supermarkets and food outlets and making exercise and fitness facilities more easily accessible for all Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, we will mount a campaign to increase awareness that obesity is a major health&nbsp;risk factor for diabetes, and to encourage Singaporeans to maintain a healthy weight in order to reduce their risk of diabetes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, we will campaign <p align=left>Column: 1747<p>against obesity directly.&nbsp; MOH will be forming an obesity prevention taskforce to explore strategies to address this issue among the young and the adults. We will study how other countries are approaching the problem, learn from them, and&nbsp;adapt to our local setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Controlling obesity in the population is tough. Campaigns can only do so much, and we need to move beyond healthy eating and regular exercise messages. &nbsp;As with other chronic medical conditions, improvements at the population level will generally be seen only in the medium term. It clearly calls for collaboration amongst various agencies and stakeholders, and the individual must take responsibility for his own health.&nbsp; We will study the scientific evidence to see what more can be done, and also learn from the promising initiatives elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the message is quite clear, at the end of it, there is no short cut to keeping slim and the only sustainable way is to control our diet and&nbsp;to&nbsp;exercise regularly.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are some people who choose quick-fix procedures such as liposuction to improve their appearance by removing the&nbsp;excess fat.&nbsp; We do not recommend such an approach.&nbsp; Liposuction carries risks and, if improperly done, can result in life-threatening complications such as bleeding and infection, and, in some cases, even death.&nbsp; Major complications and deaths arising from liposuction have been reported in the US and in Europe.&nbsp; Nearer home,&nbsp;in a neighbouring&nbsp;country, there has been a report of a patient who underwent an eye-bag surgery, a tummy tuck and liposuction.&nbsp; She developed complications, went into coma and remains in coma.&nbsp; Singaporeans should be aware of this.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my Ministry has also begun to receive unconfirmed feedback of liposuction being done in some outpatient clinics that have led to problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1748<p> Let me stress that liposuction should be done by properly-trained doctors and in properly-equipped and staffed operating theatre facilities.&nbsp; Doctors have a duty of care to their patients, and they should practise only within their competence.&nbsp; For those customers who insist on undergoing liposuction, they should seek qualified and experienced doctors to do this for them in accredited surgical facilities.&nbsp; Otherwise, they risk their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now on HIV.&nbsp; Mayor Zainudin cited some statistics from a survey to express his concern about the public awareness on HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; The statistics remind us that we need to continue working hard with new strategies to address these misconceptions, improve knowledge and, more importantly, change behaviours so that HIV can be better prevented and diagnosed earlier. Another area that needs to be addressed is the stigma against people living with HIV and AIDS.&nbsp; HPB has specially targeted education programmes for youths, parents, high-risk heterosexual men, men-who-have-sex-with-men and single women.&nbsp; The programmes are carried out in schools, in higher educational institutions, workplaces, entertainment spots as well as within the community. To support&nbsp;the expanded efforts, we have secured an additional $10 million for HIV education over the next&nbsp;two years.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On teenage abortions, our data showed that teenage abortions have not been on the rise.&nbsp; In fact, the number of abortions has declined from a peak of about 1,700 annually in the&nbsp;year 2000/2001 to about 1,300 in&nbsp;the year 2005/2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;But still it is a significant number, and therefore, we agree with Dr Lam that it is important to educate our youth on safe sex to prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, and we will continue to monitor closely the abortion rates among <p align=left>Column: 1749<p>teenagers. HPB works closely with the MOE and MCYS in this effort.&nbsp; Today, all our secondary schools offer sexuality education&nbsp;that teaches the consequences of sex and how to say \"no\" to sex.&nbsp; Contraception and STI are included in the curriculum.&nbsp; HPB complements this with an STI/AIDS prevention programme called \"Breaking Down Barriers\".&nbsp;&nbsp;This programme has an interactive, multi-media mass education session that covers topics like abstinence and condom use, and a class-based component that teaches skills like responsible decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation skills on saying no to sex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HPB is also taking the fight beyond the schools.&nbsp; It recently developed the \"Love Them. Talk about Sex\" Programme, in collaboration with MCYS.&nbsp; This is conducted in workplaces, schools and community venues and provides information and tips on how to broach and discuss sexuality issues with their children.&nbsp; The programme is supported by a toolkit, a helpline and a website.&nbsp;&nbsp; HPB is also working with Family Service Centres and other youth organisations to reach out to youth-at-risk and equip them with the life-skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dr Fatimah has pointed out, in our society, people are generally reluctant to think about or talk about death or issues related to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has thus far adopted a cautious approach in promoting Advanced Medical Directive (AMD). We acknowledge that&nbsp;it is a very personal decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, although medical technology can sometimes struggle to delay death in the final stages of a terminal illness by very invasive and intrusive methods of treatment, it remains true that death cannot ultimately be avoided.&nbsp; The aggressive methods may also cause the terminal patients to suffer more rather than less.&nbsp; The living will or Advanced Medical Directive&nbsp;gives terminal patients <p align=left>Column: 1750<p>with no prospect of recovery the ability to pass on in peace and dignity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although my Ministry has undertaken public education about the AMD since its introduction in 1997 to explain its value for both individuals and&nbsp;families, to reassure about the treatment safeguards and to allay fears about the process, to date fewer than 9,000 people have made an AMD.&nbsp; We will increase our education efforts to improve social awareness and understanding of AMD and end-of-life issues, especially when our population is rapidly aging.&nbsp; We will also review and simplify the administrative processes to reduce difficulties for those who choose to make an AMD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank Mr Sam Tan for bringing up this subject to help increase public awareness about skin and organ donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently,&nbsp;the Human Organ Transplant Act&nbsp;(HOTA) only allows for kidney, heart, liver and cornea donations. When the HOTA was enacted in 1987, it only included kidney donation and&nbsp;in 2004, the Act was amended to include liver, heart and cornea donations and was done&nbsp;after extensive public consultations showed that the majority of Singaporeans supported such inclusion. Because organ donation under the HOTA runs on an opt-out system, we have ensured that the inclusion of organs in the Act has public support and address the more urgent transplant needs of Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although skin donation is not covered under the HOTA, Singaporeans can pledge to donate their other organs including the skin through the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act.&nbsp; This does not affect their decisions under HOTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skin donations are no less important than kidneys in saving lives. From 1998 to 2007, the National Skin Bank managed to receive over 100,000 square <p align=left>Column: 1751<p>centimetres of skin grafts from 50 donors after their death.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has benefited more than 100 Singaporean patients, mostly suffering from extensive burn injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sam Tan thought that each year, up to 20 burn victims die because there is not enough skin to cover their burns. From our data, for the past five years&nbsp;an average of&nbsp;eight deaths per year come from severe burn injuries. This figure includes both Singaporeans and foreigners. Most of these patients die not because there&nbsp;are not enough skin grafts available, but because of their other very severe injuries.&nbsp; Our Skin Bank maintains a good reserve of skin grafts.&nbsp; However, in exceptional situations, we have the ability to tap the assistance of overseas Skin Banks for additional grafts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we intensify our public awareness efforts on organ donation over the next few years, we hope that more members of the public will consider pledging their skin&nbsp;as well as other organs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min was concerned about the impact of medical tourism on healthcare for Singaporeans.&nbsp; My Ministry will ensure that Singaporeans have access to good and affordable healthcare.&nbsp; My Minister has earlier explained how we will be investing to further improve the quality of our healthcare for our citizens.&nbsp; Indeed, it is the high quality of our healthcare that attracts foreign patients to our shores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although foreign patients can choose to go to our restructured hospitals as unsubsidised patients, they make up less than 2% of admissions in our restructured hospitals currently.&nbsp; That said, MOH understands the concern that Dr Lam has described, and will ensure that Singaporeans are never disadvantaged even as foreign demand for healthcare services here grows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1752<p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And to do so,&nbsp;we&nbsp;will build more&nbsp;restructured hospitals&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;add more beds, and this has&nbsp;been explained also by my&nbsp;Minister.&nbsp; Next, we are facilitating the private sector's building up of medical infrastructure to meet increased foreign demand. Third, we are strengthening our healthcare manpower pipeline&nbsp;&ndash; both local and foreign.&nbsp; Together, these measures will increase our capacity to meet the anticipated healthcare needs in Singapore.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mdm Chair, I have three questions to ask.&nbsp; Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister with regard to medical tourism and manpower development. Now that we are focused on attracting one million medical tourists by 2012, how will that impact on the Ministry's manpower situation, particularly since now we are already seeing quite a critical shortage in some areas like specialists, and so on?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is that in the Ministry's projection as well?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to ask, now that we have got means testing in place, and it will be implemented in January 2009, whether the Ministry will be allocating more resources to the B2 and C class wards, particularly in reviewing some of the areas where currently subsidies are not given or lesser subsidies are given, for example, the list of standard and&nbsp;non-standard medicines.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some medicines are non-standard and prescribed by doctors because they are more effective,&nbsp;but they are still considered non-standard in the B2 or C class treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, I would like to ask how much of the $88 million that has been given to help in developing mental resilience has gone into supporting community-based mental groups,&nbsp;that are helping to provide shelter and other forms of assistance to those suffering from mental illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;I would say that I am very happy with the Minister's announcement <p align=left>Column: 1753<p>on means testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really most welcomed and I think it would allay a great deal of the fears of Singaporeans.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> I thank Mdm Halimah for the three queries.&nbsp; For&nbsp;medical tourism, the projected million more tourists coming to Singapore, yes, surely as I explained in my earlier reply, all this must impact&nbsp;the supply on the&nbsp;manpower side, particularly at the specialist level.&nbsp; The key, I think, is not to stop them from coming, but&nbsp;to make sure that we ramp up supply at the same time.&nbsp; So part of the big increase in the health budget this year will go towards enlarging our manpower pool, as I elaborated earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;On local training, we will always be short, and that is why it is&nbsp;crucially important&nbsp;that we continue to tap on external sources as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my&nbsp;earlier reply, and I think it is worth repeating,&nbsp;last year, while we graduated slightly more than 200 doctors here, we recruited more than 400 from overseas with&nbsp;recognised degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the approach that we will take on this particular subject.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for means testing and&nbsp;standard drugs list,&nbsp;we have a medical committee of experts to advise us&nbsp;and they regularly review the standard drugs list.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, they will add some but there is&nbsp;hardly any year when they withdraw some.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will&nbsp;top up the list as and when they have better evidence of the cost-effectiveness of the new drugs and I stand advised by the medical professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;a key theme that ran through my earlier speech&nbsp;&ndash; which is also the point&nbsp;that Mdm Halimah&nbsp;shared with us just now&nbsp;&ndash; is moderating public expectation.&nbsp; The easiest thing in the world is to keep on expanding the standard drugs list.&nbsp; In fact, why have a list?&nbsp; All drugs should be allowed. Then you have Avastin, the example that I gave,&nbsp;but it is&nbsp;US$100,000 per drug, per patient.&nbsp;So while we keep on increasing our health budget, if the economy is doing well, there is always a <p align=left>Column: 1754<p>limit to things, and that is why it is so important how&nbsp;we target our subsidy, so that those who genuinely need it will get it, and those who can afford to pay more,&nbsp;they should co-pay more.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that Mdm Halimah finds the parameters that we have finalised on, which is in Annex A, an acceptable scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the&nbsp;$88 million fund for mental health, how much of it will go into community groups, I do not carry those figures on top of my head.&nbsp; I do not know whether Mr Heng does.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Heng Chee How:</B> On the $88 million, I would just like to say that $55 million out of the $88 million is actually earmarked for developing community themes as well as manpower development for use in this area. &nbsp;I do not have&nbsp;the detailed breakdown in terms of whether or not it goes into those organisations that&nbsp;she has&nbsp;mentioned, but certainly this $55 million is targeted in that direction.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Madam, first I would like to clarify that I did not say Singaporeans are denied the choice of class of wards in the hospitals, as what the Minister has said earlier.&nbsp; The point I made was that Singaporeans are now denied the right to decide for themselves what is affordable to them&nbsp;upon hospitalisation&nbsp;and the&nbsp;patients decide which class of ward they would like to get admitted to. The affordability is now decided by the Government by means testing, as the percentage of subsidy to C class ward is based on that. This is a&nbsp;fundamental change.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I would like to clarify with the Minister: does the Minister not agree that the outcome of means testing would be for the not-so-rich to pay more? &nbsp;The very rich will go to a private hospital. Is the Government unable to afford providing&nbsp;healthcare without implementing means testing? Madam, I am alarmed by the Minister's statement that if we do not <p align=left>Column: 1755<p>implement means testing, our C class ward standard might degenerate to standard in the 70s.&nbsp;Are we that poor&nbsp;now as a nation, that we need to do that, poorer than in the 70s as a nation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I refer now to the Annex distributed by the Minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of subsidy for C class wards is stated in the Annex.&nbsp; I would like to know from the Minister how long will this percentage last. What is the commitment of the Government to the long-term subsidy percentage of C class wards based on the income level that is listed here?&nbsp; I note that the $3,200 income level which would qualify for the C class ward subsidy of 80% is higher than what was intended to,&nbsp;as reported in the press.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what is the basis on which&nbsp;he decides on what income level&nbsp;he will subsidise 80%.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, what level of subsidy can we expect after means testing is implemented?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>and, in the hospitals, at the admission counter, we have been doing this for many years now, what we call financial counselling, because we also want to make sure that the patients choose the right class of wards.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the point of admission, once we know&nbsp;what are the patient's medical conditions, we can counsel the patients.&nbsp; We have a lot of statistics, average figures and percentiles, to tell us that for this particular condition, there is a likelihood that you will stay six days and if you go to class A, this is the bill size; if you go to class B2, this is the bill size; <p align=left>Column: 1756<p>and C.&nbsp; The&nbsp;patient can&nbsp;then make an informed choice.&nbsp; So that freedom remains.&nbsp; Means testing allows us,&nbsp;once&nbsp;we know your salary level and which subsidy band,&nbsp;to churn out similar tables accordingly and customise it to the particular illness the patient is being admitted for,&nbsp;the patient then makes&nbsp;his or her&nbsp;choice.&nbsp; That is how it will work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low's point is that means testing will hurt the middle class.&nbsp; Yes, potentially.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower class, the low-income group, has no means testing and precisely because of this, that is why if you look and study carefully&nbsp;Annex A, we have purposely&nbsp;\"erred on the side of generosity\"&nbsp;&ndash; I used those words &ndash; and I think nobody can fault me for not doing so.&nbsp; That we have deliberately included a substantial number of the lower-middle and the middle-middle and perhaps even part of the upper middle-income group.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at $3,200, it is almost 60% of the Singaporean working&nbsp;population.&nbsp; And so for those 60%, full subsidy remains and even then, if you cross that one, it is a graduated scale&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;which happens to be a suggestion that came in from the public which we then incorporated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the key point is this&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;which was a question that I posed in my earlier speech&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;what are class C and B2 wards built for?&nbsp; That is a fundamental question.&nbsp; Is it built for every Singaporean?&nbsp; In other words, 100%&nbsp;all go to class C, which is really the British National Health System.&nbsp; One class&nbsp;&ndash; rich or poor, millionaire or pauper, you go into that one class, take it or leave it.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;then there is no choice.&nbsp; Here we&nbsp;provide full freedom of choice.&nbsp; You can go to a private hospital, or you can go to different classes in a public hospital.&nbsp; So that is the way we handle it.&nbsp; But things, as I have said,&nbsp;have now developed in such a way that today, the situation is quite different from 30 years ago.&nbsp; We cannot unwind the clock.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started my career, class C ward was really for the very poor, and I spent <p align=left>Column: 1757<p>time walking the ward floor, and I talked to patients&nbsp;who were clearly the poor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years later, today, it is very different.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the poor, some of them, remain in class C, but many do not look poor to me at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the current situation which I think is not a bad development,&nbsp;in a sense,&nbsp;because over the years, the economy does well, so we share out the economic growth with all strata of the Singaporean population.&nbsp; So even the poor can see their service level improve over time and, over the next 10&nbsp;to 15 years, I hope we can continue to do so, so that&nbsp;no matter how poor you are, your healthcare continues to rise up in accordance with the economic status of the whole country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that is the approach we take.&nbsp; But if you&nbsp;do not put in this filter, which is the means testing, and if you keep on doing that,&nbsp;today, it is all right, only less than 10% of the top 20% stays in class C.&nbsp; But&nbsp;without means testing, do you think it will stay at 10%?&nbsp; Surely not,&nbsp;unless, as suggested by Ms Sylvia Lim, we freeze: no more development of class C wards.&nbsp; But I think that will be unfair to the poor in 10 to 15 years' time, and they may not agree that today's current standard of class C will be&nbsp;adequate by the year 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem we are trying to resolve here, and&nbsp;I think it is a very practical way forward.&nbsp; So all patients, rich or poor,&nbsp;you are eligible to go into class C, and if you look at the subsidy for the rich, it will still&nbsp;be very heavy.&nbsp;&nbsp;At class C, you only pay one-third of the cost, and for those who are earning $8,000 to $9,000, you can well afford it.&nbsp; I have checked the Medisave balances of all those of the higher-income group&nbsp;&ndash; largely $28,000, $27,000, more than $25,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is enough money in their Medisave, even&nbsp;if they are not insured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1758<p> But my key message remains the same.&nbsp; Means testing is not&nbsp;to deliberately upset people&nbsp;or that&nbsp;we want to means test you and charge you more.&nbsp; Means testing is to remind Singaporeans that, going forward, please think about hospitalisation and, therefore, buy insurance.&nbsp; Everyone must buy basic MediShield, and if you are of the middle-income group, let us say you earn more than $4,000, please top it up with a rider.&nbsp; And if you do, you do not have to go to class B2 or&nbsp;C because if your insurance entitles you to class B1 stay, and, of course, you go to class B1.&nbsp;&nbsp;So why go there (B2/C) and compete with the poor?&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the more we tightly implement means testing, the more we can do for the really poor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that&nbsp;the standard drugs list which Mdm Halimah talked about expands so slowly?&nbsp; It is because&nbsp;many can&nbsp;afford&nbsp;to pay for&nbsp;the more expensive non-standard drugs and they should be paying out of their&nbsp;pocket or get their insurance to pay for&nbsp;them.&nbsp;Without means testing, they can easily go to class C and they know they will be entitled to these very heavily subsidised expensive drugs.&nbsp;But it is the same limited budget.&nbsp; Of course, every year, we grow that budget but when more people are putting their hands in for these drugs, surely, each will get less.&nbsp; This was similar to our family planning slogan many years ago&nbsp;&ndash; \"more mouths to feed, so less to each\".&nbsp; This is the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;So,&nbsp;let us be&nbsp;practical.&nbsp; This is the reality: between demand and need,&nbsp;there is a wide gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, let us take a realistic and practical approach to this.&nbsp; Face the fact and the way I am doing it is extremely gentle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked how long will Annex A stay as it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;It depends because situation will evolve and income group adjusts.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economy grows and&nbsp;income profiles change,&nbsp;we will adjust with time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp;whether it is PA's rates, or whatever means testing criteria for housing and education, they are&nbsp; adjusted <p align=left>Column: 1759<p>periodically and, surely, whoever is the Health Minister prevailing at that time will do that kind of adjustments too.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the fundamental policy remains, that health subsidy is limited.&nbsp; So let us see&nbsp;how we can share it out as fairly as we can but, at the margin, be flexible, so that those we think are of the high income group, if they have genuine difficulty, if they are not able to buy an insurance because of some complicated&nbsp;congenital illnesses, I am sure whoever is the Health Minister, or the hospitals running it, will take a flexible approach to that.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

One is with regard to retaining medical health professionals in the public sector. We understand that there is always an efflux of top surgeons or specialists&nbsp;into the private sector because it is always more lucrative in terms of monetary factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the last time we had a pay revision in the public sector, it&nbsp;was&nbsp;probably umpteen years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Minister whether there is a feasibility of benchmarking the pay of public healthcare workers to those in the private sector.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is with regard to incentives to stay trim. One of my suggestions is whether we could incentivise&nbsp;by lowering&nbsp;the medical premium for health insurance for people who keep trim and fit. We can actually use the BMI as a standard to measure health, maybe even a lucky draw for people who remain healthy or thin for that matter.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> The&nbsp;resignation of public sector doctors to the private sector is a problem that we have to manage day by day, year by year,&nbsp;because so long as the private sector exists and they pay <p align=left>Column: 1760<p>better,&nbsp;some of our staff will be tempted to go there.&nbsp; Therefore, we have to be competitive in our remuneration terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lam mentioned about some adjustments \"umpteen years ago\"&nbsp;&ndash; those were the words he used&nbsp;&ndash; but that&nbsp;was&nbsp;not quite right.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;been adjusting and last year, for example,&nbsp;there were some adjustments, and I am quite sure this year we will&nbsp;look at&nbsp;it again.&nbsp; Maybe the KK Hospital did not make an adjustment, but I believe that we certainly provided budget for the hospitals to make such adjustments.&nbsp; But the key point remains that we must compete with the market and we have to retain them.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;always&nbsp;grateful that we have so many&nbsp;very good doctors. They could have easily crossed the road and make&nbsp;more money, but they stay because they know that the bottom half of Singaporeans have no choice, that if they do not stay, their expertise will be lost to this bottom half of Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are truly grateful to them.&nbsp; But being grateful is not enough, we should also pay them properly, which we will.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On staying trim and the incentives for doing so, I have been watching this development with interest.&nbsp; Many insurers talk about it. When I probe more deeply, it is fluff.&nbsp; The theory is easy&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;if you engage in healthy lifestyle and, therefore, your health should be better,&nbsp;I reward you. The difficulty is always this&nbsp;&ndash; how do you certify?&nbsp; Everybody will put up their hands and say, \"Yes,&nbsp;I exercise three&nbsp;to four times.\"&nbsp; What&nbsp;am I going&nbsp;to do? Put a CCTV and watch&nbsp;their movement?&nbsp; Impossible.&nbsp; Check BMI&nbsp;but&nbsp;there will be many&nbsp; people who will say, \"I am born, for some reason, fat.&nbsp; The fat cells are more and therefore I am fat.&nbsp; It is very unfair.\"&nbsp; So these are the problems that we will face, but I think we should try to keep it on our mind and see&nbsp;if they are practical to do, we will.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Instead of the 50th percentile announced publicly, it is now the 60th percentile of salary level.&nbsp; And, secondly, between the 60th and the 80th percentiles, it&nbsp;is not going to be a steep incline but it is going to be incremental&nbsp;and gradual.&nbsp;&nbsp;These two amendments have been made as a result of extensive public consultation, which I am glad the Ministry has taken into account and also because of the feedback given by some of&nbsp;our MPs.&nbsp;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head&nbsp;M of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking, first, at efficiency.&nbsp; The goal must be the optimal use of public money in running of the Government.&nbsp; I understand that the Manpower Management Framework was implemented in 2004 in line with the Government's policy of keeping the public sector \"lean and trim\".&nbsp; Along with manpower reduction, the Government wanted to encourage the outsourcing of non-core operations to the private sector with the following objectives.&nbsp; First, to allow the private sector to perform jobs that it could perform better than the public sector.&nbsp; Second, to allow the Government to trim the wage bill for Ministries and Government departments,&nbsp;while helping them to focus on their core areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I understand that the goal of 3% annual manpower reduction from 2004 to 2006 was implemented for all Ministries.&nbsp; In many areas, reduction goals&nbsp;were&nbsp;achieved through corporatising departments and subcontracting work out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, this encouraged reductions in the official staff strength, without necessarily too much&nbsp;emphasis on the productivity of Ministries.&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether, in terms of dollar amount spent on payments to cover the costs of these outsourced functions, did we enjoy productivity gains?&nbsp; In other words, have we trimmed staff on the one hand only to bear increased services costs on the other?&nbsp; Reducing headcount with resulting higher costs might not make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to highlight&nbsp;a common problem that accompanies <p align=left>Column: 1765<p>outsourcing.&nbsp; And this is the temptation to go for the cheapest tenderer&nbsp;versus&nbsp;fierce competition among private sector companies that may unwittingly drive salaries of Singaporeans lower, especially of the corporatised organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also have specific questions with regard to a few increases&nbsp;which I noticed in the Budget Book.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Elections Department has increased its budget,&nbsp;by almost 100% from $14 million to about $28 million; MEWR, 107% to $13 million; and MOH's bill went up by 443% to $402 million plus.&nbsp; Could the Minister please explain these increases?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government is now correctly focusing on R&amp;D, especially for SMEs for our long-term competitiveness.&nbsp; We&nbsp;need a coordinated push in Government for this to succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can learn from the US. &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1944, the then President Franklin D. Roosevelt started the process by getting his wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development to find&nbsp;ways to mobilise science in times of peace, among other things, for the creation of new enterprises and bringing in&nbsp;new jobs.&nbsp; The resulting report was one called \" <I>Science: The Endless Frontier\"</I>.&nbsp; It led to a tremendous focus in the US for more active government role in funding research in the private sector as well as to engage the private sector in Government research work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, therefore, many government agencies have budgets to fund research by&nbsp;or together with the private sector with a particular focus on smaller&nbsp;companies.&nbsp; An example is the programme called&nbsp;Small Business Innovation Research, or SBIR, where government agencies are required to reserve parts of their funds for small businesses, typically funding the critical startup and development stages and also in innovating <p align=left>Column: 1766<p>new products,&nbsp;whether outside or within government.&nbsp; In the US,&nbsp;government as well as private sector big companies&nbsp;do not shy away from partnering startups for high-risk development work.&nbsp; We need to develop such a culture here and the Government can start this process for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, recently, the position of a Chief Innovation Officer (CIO)&nbsp;was announced, in fact, in the Budget. The type of person engaged in this role is very important.&nbsp; The Civil Service's reward structure may not incentivise long-term efforts such as R&amp;D and capability development.&nbsp; The reward structure therefore needs to be reviewed if we want success.&nbsp; The CIO has to be someone, I believe, with substantial private sector experience if we want this to succeed.&nbsp; Also, key performance indicators should not just be pegged to the number of projects implemented but the number of projects undertaken, even those that failed.&nbsp; Otherwise, we will likely just see betting on winners and just big companies and Government officers shying away from risky but worthwhile projects.&nbsp; Could the Minister please elaborate on the intended role of the CIO?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Manpower Planning<br>\r\n</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Madam, MOF and PSD are joining hands to promote greater efficiency in the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Headcount numbers have been falling since 2004 as a result of the&nbsp; implementation of the&nbsp;Manpower Management Framework Reduction plan.&nbsp; This manpower reduction has been partly achieved through outsourcing specific services.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp;what is&nbsp;the profile of those who have been asked to leave, eg, age, skills, and the cost-effectiveness of this approach.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been suggested that&nbsp;outsourcing is being implemented not to just private sector firms, but to GLCs and statutory boards.&nbsp; While there is no indication that <p align=left>Column: 1767<p>this is the case,&nbsp;it has been suggested that some functions that used to fall within the ambit of MINDEF have been transferred to&nbsp; DSTA.&nbsp; Could the Government clarify how rationalisation and outsourcing&nbsp; has helped to raise&nbsp;cost-efficiency&nbsp;in the Government?&nbsp; It has been suggested that&nbsp;public money is just moving from one hand to another, that is,&nbsp;there has not been a serious revisitation of how we can make our Government leaner, not just in terms of manpower size but also in terms of cost.&nbsp; Can the Minister also elaborate on the Manpower Management Framework in the Civil Service and how this contributes to making the Government more efficient?&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Government E-services</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Madam, Singapore has been ranked top internationally in terms of provision of Government services online.&nbsp; This is indeed a great achievement, in line with worldwide trend and increasing computer literacy of our population.&nbsp; As a user myself, I enjoy the convenience provided by the SingPass.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand Ministries and Government departments are assessed on the availability of their services online and their utilisation rate.&nbsp; To boost the utilisation rate, I am not sure if services are only made available online and other channels are removed.&nbsp; Is this&nbsp;a key performance indicator in the public service?&nbsp; Are there services to date which have been removed or made inaccessible through other means?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the GST Offset Package registration period last year, thousands of Singaporeans thronged CPF offices during the last few days.&nbsp; According to a <I>Zaobao</I> report, many of them are senior citizens.&nbsp; They have chosen to queue up at the counters personally, some even with <p align=left>Column: 1768<p>walking difficulties, to sign up or just to confirm that they have signed up.&nbsp; I suspect among the 4% of eligible citizens who have signed up then, as reported, or about 100,000 of them, a fair proportion of them are computer illiterate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how Internet-savvy Singaporeans become, as with any society, there will always be a group of people, either elderly, disabled, poor or lowly educated who will not use the Internet, or will not find using the computer an accessible and convenient experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They will need human service personnel to help them.

The first concerns risk management and MOF's oversight over GIC and Temasek, while the second concerns how both of them can take a leadership role in the changed environment that SWFs operate in.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister responded to my earlier questions in Parliament some months ago that MOF does not want to micro-manage GIC and Temasek.&nbsp; I understand his reason.&nbsp; Lately, however, we have seen both GIC and Temasek adopting different investment models when investing in banks and other companies with different results and I feel <p align=left>Column: 1769<p>that MOF needs to establish certain minimum standards for investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current hands-off approach has resulted in both GIC and Temasek investing heavily in banks&nbsp;&ndash; a total of more than $30 billion, with a further investment of $14 billion being&nbsp;injected to GIC which was announced on 28th February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While for each of the GIC and Temasek funds their portfolio may make sense individually,&nbsp;does&nbsp;the Minister not think that if we look at Singapore as a whole, the Singapore portfolio may be too over-invested in financial institutions?&nbsp; These massive investments are over and above Temasek's substantial stakes in DBS and Standard Chartered Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that MOF needs to better manage the&nbsp;two SWFs to protect our reserves.&nbsp; Instead of investing all in banks given the circumstances, would it not have been beneficial from both a balanced portfolio consideration and also&nbsp;the fact that commodities and food prices will continue to rise for GIC and Temasek to perhaps invest part of the money into agricultural type of companies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point is that some rationalisation needs to be made for both GIC and Temasek to have some coordinated pattern of investment and MOF is best positioned to do this.&nbsp; One way, for example, could be, if MOF makes an assessment that a portfolio of, say, X%,&nbsp;$20 billion is appropriate for total investment into banks by both entities, then MOF could monitor the investments made by each of GIC and Temasek at their own pace, based on their own investment rules.&nbsp; And when the total investments of the two reach close to a limit of $20 billion set, MOF could alert and pay closer scrutiny on further investments, and perhaps even require both GIC and Temasek to operate on <p align=left>Column: 1770<p>different rules when this happens and get MOF's approval for these investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, recently, we have also seen a changing environment for SWFs and there is a need for greater scrutiny and the operating environment is rapidly changing.&nbsp; In fact, we are seeing discussion of this every day in the press.&nbsp; There are calls for greater transparency of all SWFs.&nbsp; The fears around the world are of SWFs investing to serve the national interest, instead of just on commercial principles on the basis that governments might also reject&nbsp;major investments&nbsp; based on this fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, we saw fierce resistance of DP World's bid to acquire port interests in the US and the mistrust sweeping the world with regard to investments by Chinese funds to secure energy resources, and generally by Arab-based funds.&nbsp; We have also seen similar</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I am not calling for them to disclose all that they do.&nbsp; This is <p align=left>Column: 1771<p>impractical and unnecessary and does not serve any interest.&nbsp; We can, however, take a leadership role in the present debate by coming up voluntarily&nbsp;with perhaps the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The major objectives of the funds;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; A transparent set of guidelines on their investment principles; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To assess the transparency of SWFs, Edwin Truman, Senior Fellow at the Pearson Institute for International Economics, came up with a scoreboard for Sovereign Wealth Funds in October 2007.&nbsp; He and his team assessed 32 SWFs, including our GIC and Temasek, on whether systematic, public information was given on the fund's structure, governance, transparency,&nbsp;accountability and behaviour.&nbsp; Out of 32 funds, Temasek <p align=left>Column: 1772<p>came out 11th, while GIC was third from the bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Domestically, there is a high public interest element in keeping Singaporeans informed about the management and returns on funds under the charge of GIC and Temasek, which are collectively estimated to be between US$200 billion and US$500 billion.&nbsp; While more is known about Temasek, 10 other SWFs still scored better than it on the Truman scoreboard.&nbsp; The GIC scored poorly in all categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 2008, Minister Mentor spoke to the media as Chairman of GIC&nbsp;and said&nbsp;that the International Monetary Fund was looking to Singapore, among others, to set disclosure benchmarks for SWFs.&nbsp; He said that this would lead GIC to become more transparent about its activities, \"but we are not going to disclose just how much year by year we make or lose because that is none of their business.&nbsp; What they want to know is: are we manipulating the market.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, even if it is none of their business to know how much GIC makes year by year, surely it is the business of Singaporeans to know this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This means an organisation's main aim is to reap the profits at the end of a year that can be published proudly in its annual report.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is an area where the mindset should be changed.&nbsp; We are living in a new enlightened economy where the <p align=left>Column: 1773<p>bottomline is not only financial responsibility but environmental and social as well.&nbsp; This change of mindset will help the masses and indeed live up to the spirit of public service by showing their genuine concern and sincerity in helping the people rather than show the company's profitability.&nbsp; They must fulfill a social responsibility and look out for those from lower-income groups in times of difficulty.&nbsp; They need not be apologetic for their lack of surplus numbers but remember that they were set up with public funding and public patronage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, urge the Ministry to look into the terms of reference for quasi-Government bodies to temper the over-zealous focus on surplus at the expense of public interest.&nbsp; These companies include those that provide basic necessities, such as food, transport, water and power supply.&nbsp; Instead, I propose that these quasi-Government organisations or companies put emphasis on increasing societal support and be more transparent in any decision-making process and be benchmarked against their ability to deliver public service.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This was because PA did not provide audited financial information on its more than a thousand grassroots organisations (GROs) in its financial statement.&nbsp; The auditor is unable to assess the financial impact&nbsp;on the financial statement of the PA arising from the non-inclusion of the financial statements of the GROs.&nbsp; These qualifications are in relation to non-compliance with Singapore's Financial Reporting Standard 24 as well as FRS 27, consolidated and separate financial statements.&nbsp; I understand that this arises from the Ministry of Finance allowing statutory boards to be <p align=left>Column: 1774<p>exempted from certain disclosure requirements of related parties through its minutes or circulars.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Tax Changes</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Madam, I have some tax-related suggestions for individuals and companies.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the NOR scheme for Singaporeans.&nbsp; The Not-Ordinarily-Resident scheme has been successful in attracting talented high-earners to base themselves here, in particular, if they travel frequently.&nbsp; This is applicable only to foreigners.&nbsp; There has been feedback by Singaporeans who <p align=left>Column: 1775<p>travel frequently that they should not be treated differently from foreigners.&nbsp; Specifically, some of them are asking to be included under the NOR tax incentive scheme, by apportioning their tax liability for the time that they spend in Singapore.&nbsp; This will encourage more of them to take up opportunities in the region and will catalyse them to internationalise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to suggest that, to assist businesses with the cost crunch, we levy a concessionary rate of property tax for commercial or industrial properties that are owner-occupied, quite like the owner occupancy concessions for property tax we have on residential properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, the foreign-sourced income received by a resident company that satisfies the qualifying conditions is not taxable.&nbsp; This is narrower than the exemption given to individuals for foreign-sourced income, which is not taxable outside some specific exceptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that we equalise the two rules for companies and individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to industry feedback that my GPC got, the present system for companies does not allow them an easy way to decide whether their foreign-sourced income is indeed exempt.&nbsp; They have to go through a very onerous application process, following which a decision will be made on the subject income by IRAS.&nbsp; This is presently retarding the consolidation of group accounts and resulting in income being managed out of Singapore but not consolidated here.&nbsp; There is a lot of benefit for us to streamline this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to mitigating inflation, I hope that we can review our tax brackets and, if needed, adjust them, since people's nominal income may have been growing but their real income may not <p align=left>Column: 1776<p>have been keeping pace with inflation, so they may end up in a higher tax bracket with a higher tax liability while at the same time earning a smaller real income due to higher costs.&nbsp; An alternative to this is what I suggested during the Budget debate, ie, to have higher reliefs for self, children or elderly parents to keep up with the costs that have gone up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I want to repeat the point made by Mr Banerjee regarding the implementation of the R&amp;D incentives which could pose some problems.&nbsp; I also agree with him that the definition of R&amp;D is quite narrow and supports high-technology product companies.&nbsp; I ask the Minister to review the definition to allow more companies, especially service companies, to benefit from innovation-driven activities.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But, so far, we have emphasised more on building economic and social security resilience.&nbsp; This is insufficient.&nbsp; Real resilience must come from within our people and the good news is that we already have it, and that is what helped the human species survive for so long.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I urge urgent investment into a climate to bring out our natural resilience so that we can become a nation of navigators rather than victims of change.&nbsp; Here, three conditions are needed:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; A warm and supportive environment to turn challenge into opportunity;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Encourage high expectations; and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Offer rain-making opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1777<p> Madam, we can leverage on the passion of the non-profit sector to build national resilience.&nbsp; We could inject resources to NGOs, NPOs and self-help groups.&nbsp; We could do a few things:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Update our current tax and legal infrastructure to favourably nurture the 3rd and 4th sector economy;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Provide land, secondment of manpower from public to people sector, tax credits for private sector and secondment or <I>pro bono</I> services;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Last but not least, we cannot expect everyone to be a rainmaker, but the key is to increase these numbers.&nbsp; When we have a critical mass of resilient citizens, we can then make systemic changes and weather any storm.&nbsp;

Members for their comments and suggestions.&nbsp; The issues they have raised fall under the following five broad categories:<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) &nbsp;Public sector performance and accountability;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Budgeting for national resilience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1778<p>Madam, our public sector continues to be rated highly for efficiency and trust.&nbsp; We were recently ranked second in the world, after Denmark,&nbsp;for government effectiveness by the World Bank,&nbsp;and our public sector expertise is highly sought-after by other countries.&nbsp; We have managed this while keeping our public sector small, compared to other developed countries, through various measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mdm Ho Geok Choo have asked whether one of our measures, ie,&nbsp;the Manpower Management Framework (MMF),&nbsp;is cost-effective and whether the manpower cuts are merely passed on to the statutory boards or to the private sector through outsourcing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MMF is imposed on a Ministry Group basis, ie, Ministry-HQ, Departments and statutory boards.&nbsp; There is no headcount reduction at the public sector level if the staff were merely moved from the Ministry-HQ to its statutory board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector achieved a reduction of almost 4,000 officers or 5%, between the years FY2004 and FY2006.&nbsp; This excluded manpower cuts due to corporatisation.&nbsp; The reduction was achieved through, firstly, outsourcing of non-core functions only when market-testing indicated better value for money and, secondly, from internal restructuring through job redesign and process streamlining.&nbsp; Outsourcing accounts for about a third of the 4,000-odd headcount reduction.&nbsp; There was also natural attrition through resignations and retirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders and quotations are called for outsourcing projects.&nbsp; It is done in the usual open and transparent manner, with no advantage given at all to any company, and regardless of whether the Government is a shareholder.&nbsp; Mr Singh has asked if Government has tended to choose the cheapest tenderer in its outsourcing.&nbsp; Let me assure Mr Singh that <p align=left>Column: 1779<p>the Government is mindful not to turn Best Sourcing into cheap sourcing.&nbsp; In fact, for the record, about a third of all Government tenders last year were not awarded to the lowest bidders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since FY2004, 70% of the non-core functions that were considered for Best Sourcing have been outsourced, resulting in total contracts worth $2.1 billion.&nbsp; The remaining 30% continued to be done in-house after market testing.&nbsp; The profile of officers affected by outsourcing varied.&nbsp; For example, in the outsourcing of car-park enforcement by URA, mostly junior level positions were affected.&nbsp; For the outsourcing of Government chalet operations, those affected included Division 1 positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would like to assure Mr Singh that productivity gains were achieved through outsourcing of non-strategic functions.&nbsp; For instance, the outsourcing of carpark enforcement by URA and HDB has resulted in annual savings of about $3.8 million, while ensuring the performance of the service provider remains satisfactory and desired outcomes are achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal restructuring has also led to productivity gains.&nbsp; One such example is the setting up of Vital.org to provide shared services for 38 public sector agencies.&nbsp; This has resulted in manpower savings of 33 headcount or annual cost savings of $1 million since FY2006.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The somewhat small reduction number belies the actual achievement.&nbsp; It does not take into account the increased workload and new functions that our agencies have been undertaking.&nbsp; For example, MFA has established new missions in regions such as the Middle-East, whilst CAAS has added the Budget Terminal and T3 to their operations at Changi Airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 1780<p>\r\n<p>6.15 pm&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is a limit to how much more we can pare down manpower in the public service.&nbsp; In view of the growing needs of the economy and the population, as well as increasingly complex issues that the service has to deal with, MOF has reviewed the MMF framework.&nbsp; Ministries and statutory boards will now be allowed to grow their manpower but in line with the overall growth rate of the resident labour force.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The specific cost increases that Mr Singh has cited are due to the following reasons, but should he require more details, I would encourage him to file the necessary Questions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of course, the Elections Department annually sets aside sufficient funds to hold a General Election as it is the Prime Minister's prerogative to call for one at any time.&nbsp; At the revised estimates stage last year, the Elections Department may have assessed that&nbsp;the likelihood of an election being called was low, and reduced its revised estimates accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main increase in MEWR's projected costs was due to the ongoing demolition of the 33 pumping stations and the reinstatement of land occupied by these stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increase in the Ministry of Health's bill for supplies and services is&nbsp;largely due to new initiatives to enhance healthcare manpower capabilities, hardware and software to improve clinical outcomes which are consistent with the objectives that the Minister for Health has just elaborated on earlier.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, efficiency and productivity alone is not enough.&nbsp; The public sector has to innovate and find creative and better ways to deliver quality service to <p align=left>Column: 1781<p>its customers.&nbsp; Mr Singh has commented on the importance of R&amp;D and innovation.&nbsp; Indeed, the public sector would be more active both in adopting innovation in providing better public service and helping to catalyse private sector innovation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned in the Budget, a new Public Service Innovation Framework enhances previous efforts to bring about breakthrough public services.&nbsp; The emphasis would be on experimentation and innovation with the recognition that many creative ideas can come from small and nimble companies besides the large firms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh has also commented on the ideal Chief Innovation Officer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The post of Chief Innovation Officer is currently being filled by senior officials&nbsp;within Ministries who have ample policy experience and who have a broad view of Government's operations that transcend Ministry or&nbsp;agency lines.&nbsp; Many are Deputy Secretaries.&nbsp; I believe they are well qualified and well placed to facilitate&nbsp;the development of more innovative public services.&nbsp; Within the Public Service Innovation Framework, other stakeholders such as the industry development agencies, the research institutes, and of course the private sector companies themselves will provide valuable perspectives on market trends and technology directions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Madam, on e-services.&nbsp; Putting public services online can provide greater convenience to our customers.&nbsp; Customers can then transact with the Government 24/7 and on the go, without having to visit Government counters in person.&nbsp; According to the&nbsp; e-Government Customer Perception Survey, which was carried out last year, nine out of 10 customers had transacted with the public sector electronically at least once.&nbsp; Of these, 93% were pleased enough with the experience to recommend others to transact with the public sector by electronic means.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1782<p> As Mr Baey has noted, such e-services have recently gained approval of the business community as well; with Singapore being regarded as the most business friendly economy by the World Bank.&nbsp; Accenture&nbsp;has also rated Singapore very favourably in its 2007 e-Government ranking which focuses on leadership in customer service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Baey has asked, however,&nbsp;if many of the elderly, disabled, poor and lowly-educated Singaporeans would face difficulty gaining access through the traditional offline channels.&nbsp; Let me assure Mr Baey that we are mindful that a small segment of the society may be less IT-savvy or not have Internet access, and we have therefore implemented several initiatives to complement the appropriate amount of offline service channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, 28 CitizenConnect centres have been set up; conveniently located all across the island at community centres and clubs, and Government agencies such as CPF and IRAS.&nbsp; Trained officers are around to help.&nbsp; In 2007, more than a hundred thousand individuals have used such centres.&nbsp; Eighty per cent&nbsp;of them expressed confidence that they will use the Internet to transact with the public sector in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, beginning November 2007, IDA will be investing some $43 million in&nbsp;programmes to help the elderly, the disabled, the poor and the less educated acquire IT literacy.&nbsp; Apart from basic computer and Internet skills, they are also taught digital lifestyle skills, such as how to make video calls over the Internet, and how to access Wireless@SG.

Mr Inderjit Singh and Ms Sylvia Lim have touched on <p align=left>Column: 1783<p>whether the Government has sufficient oversight of GIC and Temasek.&nbsp; Mr Singh has also asked whether the Government should set some broad guidelines which&nbsp;GIC and Temasek should abide by.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, let me explain how the Government relates to GIC and Temasek.&nbsp; GIC and Temasek operate independently of each other and of the Government.&nbsp; Their mandates are to maximise the overall returns of their investments within their respective risk tolerance limits.&nbsp; GIC's and Temasek's performance is assessed and monitored on the basis of the overall returns of the respective portfolios.&nbsp; Up to now, as Members would know, they have done creditably, with GIC averaging an annual return of 9.5% in US dollar terms over a period of 25 years to March 2006; and Temasek's total shareholder return by market cap since 1974 has averaged over 18% annually in Singapore dollar terms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both have achieved these good returns because they have professional management teams drawn from all over the world and without interference from the Government.&nbsp; They do their jobs with the single objective of maximising the long-term returns on the portfolios, without any political agenda whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, it does not mean that the Government has no responsibility to ensure these institutions continue to be managed well.&nbsp; The Government ensures that both GIC and Temasek have competent boards who oversee their performance and risk management frameworks.&nbsp; The Government regularly reviews reports from GIC and Temasek on the overall investment performance, the portfolio risks profile and risk management.&nbsp; This is the right balance when exercising oversight.&nbsp; The danger of any higher level of oversight is that the Government could end up micro-<p align=left>Column: 1784<p>managing.&nbsp; It would give others the mistaken notion that the Government influences the individual investment decisions of GIC and Temasek, and will raise even more concerns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know Mr Singh, like many others, is understandably curious about the recent high profile investment made by the two agencies.&nbsp; He should be assured that these investments were made after very thorough assessments of the market developments, risks and potential&nbsp;returns including factoring in the opportunities and risks that they can afford to take in a down market.&nbsp; GIC and Temasek are long-term players out to seek long-term returns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, Mr Singh's advice on diversifying their investments would no doubt resonate with GIC and Temasek.&nbsp; GIC already manages a diversified portfolio across a wide range of asset classes in markets worldwide, including publicly-listed equities, fixed income instruments, commodities, real estates, private equities and across different industries and different geographies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek, too, has a substantially diversified portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent high profile investments by GIC and Temasek do not signal any shift in their investment strategies.&nbsp; As they have stated, they made these investments because the current financial situation in US and Europe offers unique and unprecedented opportunities for long-term investors.&nbsp; As long-term&nbsp;investors, they are able to take calculated risks in the short to medium term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh suggested that the Government has some level of coordination between the investments by GIC and Temasek so as to limit the risks for Singapore as a whole.&nbsp; The Government does not coordinate GIC's and Temasek's investments, but does look at the risks in totality to ensure that, firstly, <p align=left>Column: 1785<p>they are within the Government's overall risk&nbsp;threshold and that, secondly, GIC and Temasek are likely to be able to provide Government with good long-term returns on their overall portfolios.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, it is absolutely critical that GIC and Temasek remain strictly independent of each other in their strategies and execution, and that the Government does not get involved in managing the investments.&nbsp; The role of the Government in the investment process is clear&nbsp;&ndash; it is to ensure that the right structures, processes, systems and controls are in place to fulfill our objectives.&nbsp; We set our expectations and constraints for the investment agencies; but these agencies make&nbsp;their own independent commercial and operational decisions.&nbsp; Both GIC and Temasek are well regarded in global markets as savvy and reputable long-term investors, and their track records stand as testimony.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Mr Singh and Ms Sylvia Lim have suggested that our investment agencies work towards more transparency and accountability.&nbsp; We already have a clear accountability framework in place; and&nbsp;one which has&nbsp;worked well thus far.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government, as shareholder&nbsp;in Temasek's case, and as fund owner in GIC's case, holds the respective Boards of Directors accountable for delivering good overall financial returns.&nbsp; In turn, the Boards oversee the respective management teams which are responsible for each company's investment and operational decisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also constitutional&nbsp;safeguards for the protection&nbsp;of reserves under which GIC and Temasek are additionally accountable to the Elected President.&nbsp; The Elected President serves as a check, independent of the Government.&nbsp; The Elected President is empowered under the Constitution to obtain information to enable him to <p align=left>Column: 1786<p>monitor these reserves and he must concur with the appointment or re-appointment of any person to the Boards of GIC and Temasek.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, Mr Singh has asked how we are tackling the sovereign wealth funds debate, or the SWF, which has gained significance recently.&nbsp; We would like to assure him that we are not passive observers in the debate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIC and Temasek's long-standing and good track records, that are referred to earlier on, have given the markets as well as&nbsp;the recipient countries assurance of their commercial orientation.&nbsp; However, MOF as&nbsp;well as the two agencies are actively engaged in dialogues with the investment recipient countries, including the US which is where the SWF debate is most prominent.&nbsp; The major recipient countries have had a high degree of respect for both GIC and Temasek, and an understanding of the commercial orientation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also a consensus to date amongst the major countries on the importance of an open investment environment that does not discriminate against SWF as compared to the other players.&nbsp; Singapore is also viewed by many as being in a good position to advance the development of voluntary best practices for the SWFs.&nbsp; This will ease international concerns about their operations.&nbsp; We are supportive of the IMF's effort to develop a set of voluntary guidelines and are open to sharing of views at the appropriate&nbsp;platforms.&nbsp; In fact, last year, we participated in the SWF Outreach Dinner with the G7 Finance Ministers as well as IMF Roundtable of Sovereign Asset and Reserve Managers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards Edwin Truman's&nbsp;Scoreboard that Ms Sylvia Lim referred to, that is actually a work-in-progress and, in fact, Mr Edwin Truman has been seeking our inputs.&nbsp; It is a useful process.&nbsp; MOF is <p align=left>Column: 1787<p>currently still in touch with the US authorities as they regard us highly and would want us to be intimately involved in setting the guidelines.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

On the specific issue of transparency and public disclosure, I agree with Mr Singh's comments that this must be practical and serve a purpose.&nbsp; In particular, this should be aimed at ensuring that GIC and Temasek continue to be commercially oriented, be professional investors, and be credibly perceived as such.&nbsp; At the same time, the type of disclosure should not compromise the competitiveness of our investment agencies&nbsp;relative to other global market players.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temasek has published an annual <I>Temasek Review</I> since 2004, which gives an overview of their investment strategy and governance framework along with the group's activities and performance.&nbsp; Temasek has also obtained Triple-A credit ratings by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, and has issued a global bond.&nbsp; GIC has already disclosed information on its website relating to its investment process, long-term performance, strategies of the various investment groups and investment highlights.&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance is in discussion with GIC on a public document that will further clarify the processes, governance and purposes for its investments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, let me now move on to Ms Lee Bee Wah's cut.&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah has asked&nbsp;whether the GLCs that provide basic services relating to food, transport, water and power supply should look beyond&nbsp; surplus achievement and shareholders' interest to social obligations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1788<p> First, let me clarify that Government-linked companies are not in any way \"quasi-government\".&nbsp; They are totally independent of the Government,&nbsp;which maintains strict arms-length relations with them for sound&nbsp;corporate governance reasons.&nbsp; All companies, regardless of&nbsp;ownership, must operate on an economically viable and sustainable basis.&nbsp; In this regard, companies which have the Government&nbsp;or Temasek as their shareholder have to operate on commercial principles and are no different from private sector companies in terms of focusing on the financial bottom line.&nbsp; This is critical for their long-term survival as they do not enjoy any advantages from the Government and are subjected to the same regulations and competitive market forces as any other company.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, it would be wrong for the Government to impose any social obligations on the management strategy or operations of any company regardless of ownership.&nbsp; It also places unfair obligations on the company's board of directors who have the fiduciary duty to act in the company's interest, and not in the interest of some other groups.&nbsp; It could, in addition, distort market pricing and affect competition in the marketplace.&nbsp; The way to keep prices of essentials affordable is not for Government to place social obligations on companies but to promote a competitive marketplace, or where there is market failure, to put in place a transparent regulatory framework.&nbsp; For Singaporeans who need help, the Government will provide targeted assistance so that they have access to essential goods and services, eg, the Government has given out U-Save rebates instead of requesting Singapore Power to lower its prices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, many companies do discharge their social responsibility voluntarily.&nbsp; For example, in 2007, the transport operators contributed public <p align=left>Column: 1789<p>transport vouchers to help the lower-income households cope with the fare increase.&nbsp; Likewise, NTUC has also given out&nbsp;$1 million worth of food vouchers to lower-income families.&nbsp; It is encouraging to see such voluntary practices of corporate social responsibility amongst our local companies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, let me now move on to Mr Low's cut on the statutory boards.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked for the reasons for change in disclosure requirements for statutory boards and comments by auditors on the People's Association's accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before November 2007, MOF, through the Accountant-General's Department, issued finance circulars to prescribe the accounting standards for statutory boards.&nbsp; The key guiding framework used has been the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards, or the SFRS.&nbsp; However, these standards are designed primarily for profit making entities in the private sector.&nbsp; Therefore, the relevance and the appropriateness of each standard to statutory boards has to be examined first before they can be adopted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November 2007, this House passed the Accounting Standards Bill, and the Act came into effect, empowering the Accountant-General to prescribe accounting standards for statutory boards.&nbsp;&nbsp; A committee of independent members with representatives from the Auditor-General's office, the statutory boards, the academic&nbsp;community&nbsp;and the public accounting firms, has been formed to advise the Accountant-General.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New SFRS&nbsp;and amendments to standards will continue to be examined for their relevance and appropriateness to the&nbsp;statutory boards.&nbsp; As such, there has been no&nbsp;change in the substance of&nbsp;preparation and presentation of accounts by statutory boards.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp;has there <p align=left>Column: 1790<p>been any move to change the disclosure requirements of statutory boards.&nbsp; Our arrangements are similar to the UK&nbsp;where the Treasury prescribes the&nbsp;standard for public sector entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards PA's non-consolidation of grassroots organisations' accounts, the auditor, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, has qualified the financial statements of People's Association on the basis&nbsp;that the accounts of the grassroots organisations were not&nbsp;consolidated.&nbsp; PA's view is that the accounts of grassroots organisations should not be consolidated for the following reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly,&nbsp;the funds in these accounts belong to the grassroots organisations.&nbsp; Secondly, the Government grants and the cost of staff support are already accounted for in PA's financial statements.&nbsp; Thirdly, the grassroots organisations are operationally self-funding through revenues from activities, courses and donations.&nbsp; Fourthly, the grassroots organisations decide on how their money should be spent for the benefit of the residents.&nbsp; And, finally, proper procurement procedures, financial control and good corporate governance practices apply to the&nbsp; grassroots organisations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to clarify that this adverse opinion pays more emphasis to the FRS27, than&nbsp;to the FRS24, which is the general exemption granted to all statutory boards on account of the onerous work that would otherwise be involved in the disclosure of related party transactions.&nbsp; This is because related party transactions are much more onerous for statutory boards compared to private sector entities due to the wide range of Government related entities.&nbsp; I should also add that other countries have similarly found a need to depart from the FRS24.&nbsp; For example, Australia fully exempts its not-for-profit public entities from such disclosures as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Accountant-<p align=left>Column: 1791<p>General's Department and the Ministry of Finance are discussing this FRS27 issue with PA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, let me now move on quickly to the issues relating to our tax regime.&nbsp; Mr Singh has asked if the Not-Ordinarily-Resident, or NOR, scheme results in unequal tax treatment between Singaporeans and expatriates, and asked if we could accord time apportionment to the Singapore-sourced income of Singaporean employees based on their time spent outside Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, it is important to note that the NOR scheme is not intended to give a protracted tax concession to individuals who newly base themselves in Singapore over those who are permanently resident here, especially our own citizens, for equity reasons.&nbsp; The tax benefit expires after five years as the aim is to encourage individuals to settle&nbsp;down here thereafter.&nbsp; We do not intend to do away with this&nbsp;five-year limit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh has also asked the Government to consider granting a concessionary property tax rate for owner-occupied commercial and industrial properties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the same tax rate of 10% of the Annual Value is applied to all properties irrespective of whether the property is owner-occupied or rented out.&nbsp; We only make the exception for owner-occupied residential properties where a concessionary tax rate of 4% is granted as part of the Government's policy to encourage home ownership.&nbsp; For commercial and industrial properties, it is a business decision whether a business chooses to buy or to rent a property.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no policy reason to favour one over the other.&nbsp; Giving a concessionary tax rate for owner-occupied commercial or <p align=left>Column: 1792<p>industrial properties will only distort business decisions and unwittingly put SMEs at a disadvantage since they are less likely to buy their own properties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh also suggested equalising rules on foreign-sourced income for individuals and companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most countries in the world continue to tax worldwide income of corporations.&nbsp; This includes countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland.&nbsp; In Singapore, locally-sourced income and only foreign-sourced income remitted from abroad are subject to tax.&nbsp; For foreign-sourced&nbsp;income remitted,&nbsp;active income, which includes branch profits, service income and dividends, are exempted if they are earned in countries&nbsp;where the&nbsp;headline tax rate is at least 15% so as to encourage our companies to venture and operate abroad.&nbsp; However, foreign-sourced income like interest income is generally passive and, therefore, not exempted.&nbsp; So, if we were to do so, this will entail significant revenue loss.&nbsp; However, to make our regime more friendly to the repatriation of foreign-sourced income, the recent Budget 2008 extends unilateral tax credit to all income including interest income earned in non-treaty countries.&nbsp; So companies will not be doubly taxed when they remit such income regardless of whether the income is earned in treaty or&nbsp;non-treaty countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh has also asked if we could review our tax brackets or raise the amount of personal income&nbsp;tax reliefs as a permanent fix for our middle-income groups who face rising cost of living.&nbsp; Madam, our personal income tax system is already very progressive.&nbsp; About two-thirds of our resident labour force do not pay taxes due to our $20,000&nbsp;income exemption threshold and various reliefs&nbsp;and rebates.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I should also add that our reliefs are not meant to offset expenditures and, hence, are not pegged to inflation.&nbsp; Rather they are given in support of our social policies, for example, parents and child relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing reliefs or adjusting the tax brackets will tend to benefit the higher income group as the lower and middle income groups already&nbsp;pay little or no taxes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just&nbsp;clarify that our R&amp;D definition for income tax purposes is consistent with that used in countries such as Ireland and the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would cover both&nbsp;downstream and upstream R&amp;D, and is applicable to both companies in the manufacturing and services sectors.&nbsp; We recognise the need for simplicity in implementing the R&amp;D incentives, and we will&nbsp;be working with IRAS to issue guidelines to clarify the operation of the R&amp;D incentives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on Miss Penny Low's cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low has rightly pointed out that real resilience must come from within our people.&nbsp; Madam, the Government has always adopted a \"Many Helping Hands\" approach with self-help and mutual help as central philosophies.&nbsp; The community, Voluntary&nbsp;Welfare Organisations, grassroots organisations and self-help groups play a very important role in this approach, reaching out to the needy to help them achieve self-reliance while building up a strong community spirit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government supports these efforts in many ways.&nbsp; Just to clarify, today, charities are exempt from income tax and property tax for premises used exclusively for charitable purposes.&nbsp; Donors to IPCs can also claim a double <p align=left>Column: 1794<p>tax deduction for their donations.&nbsp; We have restricted this to IPCs so that we can target the tax concession at organisations whose causes benefit the Singapore community as a whole, as opposed to those with&nbsp;sectional or commercial interests.&nbsp; Apart from the favourable tax treatment, there are other measures which, I believe,&nbsp;MCYS would be addressing&nbsp;in greater detail in its COS, following the recommendations of the Social Enterprise Committee.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to summarise, the Government has provided substantial support towards the people sector organisations and we will continue to work closely with them.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
