Mr Speaker, Sir, this announcement  has\r\n\r\ncome  as  a piece of very good news to the hawkers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. The life of a hawker is  very  hard\r\n\r\nindeed.  This is particularly so for those hawkers\r\n\r\nwho  have  a big family to support. Rain or  shine\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  go out in the streets  to  earn  a\r\n\r\nliving.  Their livelihood is a very difficult  and\r\n\r\nprecarious  one. Some of them have been  \"illegal\"\r\n\r\nhawkers  for 10 to 20 years. They are not sure  of\r\n\r\nthe  next  meal, so to speak. Most of the  present\r\n\r\nhawkers  in  Singapore became  hawkers  originally\r\n\r\nbecause of the unemployment situation in the past.\r\n\r\nAlthough  many new factories have been established\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  after  the  implementation  of  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme and thus provide  many\r\n\r\njob   opportunities,  these  hawkers   cannot   be\r\n\r\nabsorbed into the factories because they  are  not\r\n\r\nskilled  workmen. Moreover, they have big families\r\n\r\nand  the wages paid in these factories are too low\r\n\r\nto maintain a big family. The wages are only three\r\n\r\nto  four  dollars a day. Our hawkers are indeed  a\r\n\r\nsocial problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics supplied by the\r\n\r\nHawkers'  Department,  there  are  about   25,000\r\n\r\nhawkers  in Singapore. About 56 per cent of  this\r\n\r\nnumber,  that  is  14,000 have been  issued  with\r\n\r\nlicences  and they thus become licensed  hawkers.\r\n\r\nThe  balance of 44 per cent are still  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers  and  they  ply  their  trade  at  street\r\n\r\ncorners, in back-lanes or on mobile vehicles.  We\r\n\r\ncannot  allow them to sink or swim by themselves.\r\n\r\nWe  should shoulder the responsibility of looking\r\n\r\nafter their welfare, particularly those who  have\r\n\r\nfamilies to look after. We must first start  with\r\n\r\nthe  registration  of  all  genuine  hawkers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and issue them with licences,  so  long\r\n\r\nas the places in which they operate are not areas\r\n\r\nscheduled for redevelopment and they do not cause\r\n\r\ntraffic  obstruction.  In  this  way,  all  these\r\n\r\nhawkers  will  be given licences and  thus  their\r\n\r\nmental   torture   will  be  ended.   They   can,\r\n\r\ntherefore, earn their living with peace of  mind.\r\n\r\nThis is an urgent task at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the urban renewal scheme,\r\n\r\nI  think the Hawkers' Department should go a step\r\n\r\nfurther  and make a survey of all the hawkers  in\r\n\r\nthe  various constituencies. It can get in  touch\r\n\r\nwith all the Members of Parliament in the various\r\n\r\nconstituencies and, in conjunction with the State\r\n\r\nand  City Planning Department, work out a  scheme\r\n\r\nfor  the  allocation of proper vacant  places  in\r\n\r\nareas  to  be used as markets and hawker centres.\r\n\r\nThe scheme will thus help to resettle our hawkers\r\n\r\non    a    rational   and   island-wide    basis.\r\n\r\nConsequently,  all the hawkers in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  do their business at  ease  in  the\r\n\r\nproper centres provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is gratifying to note that\r\n\r\nthe  Government, in conjunction with the  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development  Board, will build  more  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres  and  let  out the stalls  at  subsidised\r\n\r\nrentals.  The  hawkers will thus be  able  to  do\r\n\r\ntheir  business  better and in an attractive  and\r\n\r\nclean   environment.   However,   I   think   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should go one step further in  looking\r\n\r\nafter the family and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  children  of  the hawkers,  particularly  in\r\n\r\nregard to their long-term welfare. It must try to\r\n\r\nform  a hawkers' association on a national  basis\r\n\r\nfor  all the 25,000 hawkers in Singapore. Perhaps\r\n\r\nassistance  can be obtained from some experienced\r\n\r\nunionists  in  the  N.T.U.C, in  organising  the\r\n\r\nhawkers  into a national association for hawkers.\r\n\r\nA dollar a day can perhaps be collected from each\r\n\r\nhawker. In this way, an insurance policy  can  be\r\n\r\ntaken  up  or a savings account opened for  them.\r\n\r\nThey  will  thus  be able to form a  co-operative\r\n\r\nsociety  through which they can buy  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats under the home  ownership\r\n\r\nscheme.  In this way the survival of the hawker's\r\n\r\nfamily will be assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past few years,\r\n\r\nindustrialisation has succeeded in providing many\r\n\r\njob  opportunities  in  Singapore.  However,  the\r\n\r\nwages  paid are low and they are only enough  for\r\n\r\nmeals, refreshment and transport expenses of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  The unemployed people are not attracted\r\n\r\nby  the  low  wages paid because  they  have  big\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pioneer industries are protected by tariff\r\n\r\nlaws. They also have the legal provision to  stop\r\n\r\nthe  workers  from asking for higher wages.  They\r\n\r\nalso   have  priority  concession  of  the  local\r\n\r\nmarket.   In   spite  of  all  this  preferential\r\n\r\ntreatment,   the   products  of   these   pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries  are  still being sold  at  very  high\r\n\r\nprices.  This is indeed a pity, in spite  of  all\r\n\r\nthat  we  have done. The prices of local products\r\n\r\nare  going  up  with the setting  up  of  pioneer\r\n\r\nindustries. This generally increases  the  burden\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore tax-payers. The cost of living\r\n\r\nis increased to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's speech, it is also stated that  early\r\n\r\nnext  year  when  a comprehensive assessment  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  of  the full effect  of  the  British\r\n\r\nmilitary withdrawal, the Government will  make  a\r\n\r\nreview   of  its  wage  policy.  This  is  indeed\r\n\r\nnecessary,  particularly so in  regard  to  those\r\n\r\npioneer industries and companies which have  made\r\n\r\nvery high profits over the past few years. We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  allow them to treat labour as a  commodity\r\n\r\nto  be  purchased at a very cheap price.  We  must\r\n\r\nrecover  the oriental traditional concept  of  the\r\n\r\nsanctity of labour, and raise the minimum standard\r\n\r\nof wages so that labour in Singapore will have the\r\n\r\nrespect  due  to it. We must accord our  labour  a\r\n\r\nfair  share  of good living for the  family  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of our national prosperity and our economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to avail myself of this\r\n\r\nopportunity to stress another point in  regard  to\r\n\r\nthe daily-rated workers in the Government or semi-Government  organisations. There are  about  7,500\r\n\r\ndaily-rated   workers  in  the  public   cleansing\r\n\r\nservice  and in the Public Health Division.  About\r\n\r\n17 per cent of them are provided with quarters. In\r\n\r\nthe Public Works Department, there are about 2,800\r\n\r\ndaily-rated workers, and only 36 per cent of  them\r\n\r\nare  provided with quarters. In the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities  Board, there  are  about  6,600\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  workers,  and about  24.2  per  cent,\r\n\r\nnamely, 1,600 of them, are provided with quarters.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the  case of the Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard, which has 2,200 daily-rated workers, 54 per\r\n\r\ncent  of them are provided with quarters. In  view\r\n\r\nof this, a great number of the daily-rated workers\r\n\r\nin  Government  and semi-Government  organisations\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay rent for their private accommodation\r\n\r\nat  $30 to $40 per room. On a small monthly salary\r\n\r\nof  $120  to  $130,  they have to  spend  quite  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  portion  on  rentals.  The  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  has been rising in recent years, and  this\r\n\r\nhas proved quite a burden to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard  is  building better accommodation  for  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Even  the  daily-rated  workers  in   the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board have been given good\r\n\r\naccommodation at subsidised rentals.  This  is  in\r\n\r\nfact  a  step  in the right direction  and  is  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with  our  policy  of  providing   better\r\n\r\naccommodation  for the poor people  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut  how is it that the daily-rated workers in the\r\n\r\nother  Government departments and statutory bodies\r\n\r\nare  not given the same privilege? We should  give\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto them so long as they are Singapore citizens. We\r\n\r\nshould  not discriminate against them. They should\r\n\r\nnot  be  made to watch the daily-rated workers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board enjoy this kind\r\n\r\nof  treatment when they themselves are  not  given\r\n\r\nthe  same treatment. I would like to appeal to the\r\n\r\ndepartments and authorities concerned to work  Out\r\n\r\na  scheme with the Housing Board and the State and\r\n\r\nCity Planning Office to provide better housing for\r\n\r\ntheir own daily-rated workers. They can also build\r\n\r\nlow-rental  high-rise flats  in  the  suburban  or\r\n\r\nrural areas so that all the daily-rated workers in\r\n\r\nGovernment service and in the statutory boards may\r\n\r\nbe  provided with proper accommodation. We  should\r\n\r\nallocate  some  funds  for  such  a  purpose.   If\r\n\r\nnecessary, the rentals can be subsidised  so  that\r\n\r\nthese daily-rated workers and their families  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to live in a more congenial environment.\r\n\r\nThis  is  necessary because many of these  workers\r\n\r\nare  living  in  squalor.  When  the  workers  are\r\n\r\nresettled  in  modern  high-rise  flats,  all  the\r\n\r\nshacks  and attap houses in which they were living\r\n\r\ncould be demolished and the land could be acquired\r\n\r\nfor   building   better  buildings  and   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment beneficial to the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the time is not ripe yet to raise\r\n\r\nthe  wages of workers generally as it will  affect\r\n\r\nour  economic  growth, we should be able  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the  lot  of  the  daily-rated  workers  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service  and the statutory  boards  in\r\n\r\nterms  of wages now. There are some who are  given\r\n\r\nonly  a  five-cent rise in wages after five years'\r\n\r\ncontinuous service. All this is really a  heritage\r\n\r\nfrom the colonial days. We should pay attention to\r\n\r\nthis point and give serious considerations to  the\r\n\r\nrationalisation  of  wages  for  the   daily-rated\r\n\r\nworkers. According to my own survey, most  of  the\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  workers  in Kampong  Kapor  have  big\r\n\r\nfamilies  to support and are in debt. So in  order\r\n\r\nto  make  ends  meet, they have to undertake  some\r\n\r\nother  tough job in the evening after a hard day's\r\n\r\nwork in order to make more money to maintain their\r\n\r\nfamilies. Sir, all this hard work throughout these\r\n\r\nyears is actually a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribution towards our national economy. So why\r\n\r\ndeny  them  the opportunity to enjoy a share,  in\r\n\r\nthe  form  of  wage increase, in  the  prosperity\r\n\r\narising out of our economic growth to which  they\r\n\r\nhave contributed? Perhaps they can he given a  10\r\n\r\nper cent rise in their wages so that they will be\r\n\r\nso pleased that they will work even harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President has also stressed in his\r\n\r\nspeech  that  we  must unite all  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and since stability and security  are\r\n\r\nassured  for  several years ahead, we  must  make\r\n\r\nfull  use  of  this time to consolidate  our  own\r\n\r\ndefence  capability. We must  build  up  our  own\r\n\r\nexpertise,  produce our own engineers, managerial\r\n\r\nand  marketing personnel in order to promote  and\r\n\r\ncope  with  a faster and higher rate of  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth,  and  be  our  own  masters.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nguideline  for our country in future.  Only  then\r\n\r\nwill  we be able to raise the standard of  living\r\n\r\nof  our  people. Only then can our children  have\r\n\r\nbetter  schools and a better environment to  live\r\n\r\nin and enjoy better amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on behalf of the people of Kampong\r\n\r\nKapor,  let  me express my felicitations  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident on our future prosperity that is  bound\r\n\r\nto come under his judicious guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I rise to join my  colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthanking  the  President for his  speech  at  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the  Second Session  of  the  Second\r\n\r\nParliament on the 21st of last month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to examine with you the\r\n\r\ninternal situation we are in today. I am  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch  concerned with the political  and  economic\r\n\r\naspects,  important  as they  are,  as  with  the\r\n\r\ncomposition  of  our society.  We  are  multi  in\r\n\r\nalmost   everything.  We  have  a  diffusion   of\r\n\r\ncultures,  a diffusion of languages, a  diffusion\r\n\r\nof   religions   and   so  on,   and   the   very\r\n\r\nheterogeneous nature of our society, open  as  it\r\n\r\nis to the influence of Western\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nideas,  makes  it imperative for  all  of  us  to\r\n\r\nunderstand   fully   the   implications   of   an\r\n\r\nuncritical adoption of certain aspects of Western\r\n\r\nculture.  I  am  not saying that  some  of  these\r\n\r\naspects  of Western culture are decadent,  but  I\r\n\r\nmust say that some of them do not conduce to  our\r\n\r\nefforts  to consolidate our people into a  viable\r\n\r\nand  rugged nation. The Chinese, the Indians  and\r\n\r\nthe  Malays, each has a distinct form of  culture\r\n\r\nin  which,  in its various ways, is prescribed  a\r\n\r\ncode  of ethical behaviour that has more or  less\r\n\r\nwithstood  the test of time. Each has a  built-in\r\n\r\nsystem  of  dynamic  growth, and  throughout  the\r\n\r\ncenturies,  the cumulative effects of  succeeding\r\n\r\nchanges  have  made our respective  cultures  the\r\n\r\nfloating-buoys to which we have clung,  and  from\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  derived our basic strength.  Our\r\n\r\nreligions  preach the brotherhood of  man,  extol\r\n\r\nthe   qualities  of  the  human  mind,  make  the\r\n\r\nachievement of peace the supreme pursuit of life,\r\n\r\nand   frown   upon  irrationalism  in   all   its\r\n\r\nmanifestations. In truth we have, each one of  us\r\n\r\nhere,   a   clearly-defined  rule   of   conduct,\r\n\r\nadherence to which can ensure our survival  as  a\r\n\r\nunited and strong people. We have nothing  to  be\r\n\r\nashamed  of,  and  yet today we  see,  among  our\r\n\r\nyouths,  almost a total disregard for the  values\r\n\r\nwhich  we have accepted without question. We  see\r\n\r\nbefore us the collapse of traditional values. Non-conformity, anti-collectivism, anti-establishment\r\n\r\nand  divergent thinking - whatever that may  mean\r\n\r\n-would  seem to be the order of the day.  We  see\r\n\r\nmanifestations  of these in the outlandish  dress\r\n\r\nof  some of our youths, the taking of drugs,  the\r\n\r\nreading  of  pornographic literature. Existential\r\n\r\nphilosophy  from  Soren  Kierkegaard  to  Jacques\r\n\r\nMaritain has been perverted to mean the denial of\r\n\r\nGod  and  the ridiculing of all existing cultures\r\n\r\nand  the  mocking of social values  dear  to  the\r\n\r\nolder  generation. Art for the sake  of  art  has\r\n\r\nbeen  venerated at the expense of the social ends\r\n\r\nthat  art  is  supposed to sub serve. Traditional\r\n\r\nfaith and values no longer serve for some of  our\r\n\r\nyouths  as  the  guide-lines of  their  life  and\r\n\r\npointers to their conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be pertinent, at this juncture, to\r\n\r\nexamine the root causes of this apparent weakening\r\n\r\nof  our moral fibre and to think of ways and means\r\n\r\nof  overcoming it by providing our youths with the\r\n\r\nappropriate alternative moral and ethical  values,\r\n\r\nlest we plunge our society into chaos. We must  at\r\n\r\nall costs, prevent the degeneration of our society\r\n\r\ninto  one  that is effete and is immersed  in  the\r\n\r\npursuit of material and sensual pleasures. We must\r\n\r\nthink of alternatives to a society that thinks  of\r\n\r\nhumility,  a society that thinks of pity  for  the\r\n\r\nweak and incompetent as vices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world that emerged from the Second World War\r\n\r\nhad  very  little  resemblance to  the  dreams  of\r\n\r\nidealists  before  the outbreak of  the  conflict.\r\n\r\nThere  was hunger, fear, hopelessness, misery  and\r\n\r\nunprecedented  violence. The hopes of  people  for\r\n\r\npeace  and  security  were rudely  shattered.  The\r\n\r\nrevival of power politics, the fear of the  spread\r\n\r\nof  nuclear  war,  and the use of  bacteriological\r\n\r\nmeans of destruction, the outbreak of conflicts in\r\n\r\nSouth-east  Asia,  the  Middle  East   and   South\r\n\r\nAmerica, all these had their deleterious effect in\r\n\r\nmoulding the thoughts of our thinking youths.  The\r\n\r\nold  order  is simply not strong enough to  ensure\r\n\r\npeace  and understanding among nations. The  great\r\n\r\nreligions  of  the world have been found  wanting,\r\n\r\nand,   as   established  institutions,  they   had\r\n\r\napparently  served their purposes.  Some  idealism\r\n\r\nwas still left behind. The spectacular advances in\r\n\r\nscience,   the  achievement  of  independence   by\r\n\r\nvarious  countries which were former  colonies  of\r\n\r\nthe  imperialist powers, the emergence  of  newly-independent nations in Africa, the United  Nations\r\n\r\nOrganisation lent a ray of hope to a  sick  world,\r\n\r\nbut apparently these did not contribute enough  to\r\n\r\nsustain  the  idea that peace and  plenty  was  at\r\n\r\nhand. Reactions of the most extreme kind began  to\r\n\r\nmake  themselves apparent all over the world.  The\r\n\r\nspread  of education through the mass media merely\r\n\r\naccelerated  the development of these  deleterious\r\n\r\ntrends    and    not   even   the    authoritative\r\n\r\npronouncements  of church and of Government  could\r\n\r\nput a stop to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem.  Overnight, certain countries that professed\r\n\r\ndemocracy  chucked it overboard and  imposed  upon\r\n\r\ntheir  peoples the most authoritarian of  regimes.\r\n\r\nThe  world saw the rise of societies that insisted\r\n\r\nupon  rigid  conformity to the officially-preached\r\n\r\ncode  of conduct and of others that permitted  and\r\n\r\nallowed  the  growth  of  irrationalism  in  their\r\n\r\nmidst.  In these fluctuations, the youths  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  have  been the main casualties.  They  feel\r\n\r\nalienated  from society, whether authoritarian  or\r\n\r\notherwise, and this feeling of alienation has  led\r\n\r\nthem  to  adopt the more nihilistic principles  of\r\n\r\nlife. The destruction of the old order - economic,\r\n\r\npolitical,   cultural  and  religious   -   became\r\n\r\nparamount, no matter what the succeeding situation\r\n\r\nmight prove to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore have not escaped from the\r\n\r\noutbreak of such irrational rashes as those  which\r\n\r\nare  plaguing Europe and America today. We do  not\r\n\r\ndiffer  in  kind but in degree only. We  see  such\r\n\r\naberrations as the adoption of the hippie  way  of\r\n\r\nlife among certain sections of our youths. We  are\r\n\r\nnow  hearing of drug-taking by our boys and girls.\r\n\r\nWe  see  other  manifestation of  this  nihilistic\r\n\r\nphilosophy  in our midst today. The propensity  to\r\n\r\nindulge  in  the pleasures of the senses  for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  enjoying such pleasures,  the  ceaseless\r\n\r\nsearch for material comforts at the expense of the\r\n\r\nless  tangible modes of life, the quest for quaint\r\n\r\nmethods  of  escaping from the grim  realities  of\r\n\r\nlife  are  all too real, and, given a  measure  of\r\n\r\npermissiveness,  one  never knows  how  far  these\r\n\r\ntrends might develop for the worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would attribute the collapse of many of our\r\n\r\ntraditional   beliefs   and   practices   to   the\r\n\r\nindulgence  of parents towards their  offspring's.\r\n\r\nWhen  a  certain  firmness is  necessary,  such  a\r\n\r\nquality, when it is most needed, is found  grossly\r\n\r\nwanting. One thing leading to another, it is  such\r\n\r\nwant  of  firmness that tends to lead our children\r\n\r\nto become undisciplined and disrespectful to us. I\r\n\r\ndo not advocate a return to the days when the cane\r\n\r\nwas  the  principal instrument for the enforcement\r\n\r\nof discipline at home. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  do  wish that parents would exercise a  greater\r\n\r\nfirmness in deciding what is essentially good  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children. An understanding of  their  needs\r\n\r\nwould  be  necessary  but, at  the  same  time,  a\r\n\r\nclearer  realisation of the goals  they  have  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children would, in no small  measure,  help\r\n\r\nthem to show the correct path for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was in London last year, a British\r\n\r\nnewspaper  published a picture taken at Hyde  Park\r\n\r\nshowing a girl stripping off her clothes until she\r\n\r\nwas  completely naked. I did make a press  cutting\r\n\r\nof  the  picture so that I can produce it here  or\r\n\r\nanywhere as an illustration, but unfortunately, my\r\n\r\ntravelling  colleague, the Member for Mountbatten,\r\n\r\nto  whom I had given the picture, told me  he  had\r\n\r\nlost  it somewhere. It was reported that the  girl\r\n\r\nstrolled   through   the   park,   unashamed   and\r\n\r\napparently  oblivious  of the  crowd  around  her.\r\n\r\nStrange  to  say, the crowd in the  park  on  that\r\n\r\nsummer day did not pay much attention to the naked\r\n\r\ngirl.  I was, to say the least, rather abashed  at\r\n\r\nthis   display  of  defiance  of  the  established\r\n\r\netiquette of social conduct, and it was a surprise\r\n\r\nto  me  that such a thing should have been allowed\r\n\r\nat all. I fail to understand the social clime that\r\n\r\ncould sanction such indecencies as this. I visited\r\n\r\nvarious other places in England and Scotland,  and\r\n\r\nit  would seem to me that many of the things  that\r\n\r\nthe  English  and Scottish youths  did  in  public\r\n\r\ncould  not  be condoned here, but it  is  possible\r\n\r\nthat  as  a result of the permissive attitudes  of\r\n\r\nthe  English and Scottish parents such  things  as\r\n\r\nthose  I have mentioned were everyday occurrences,\r\n\r\nand  were  accepted as such by them. Our  oriental\r\n\r\nheritage would frown upon an excessive display  of\r\n\r\naffection  in public because we believe  that  the\r\n\r\ndisplay  of  such affections can be made  at  more\r\n\r\nappropriate  places. We see here,  therefore,  the\r\n\r\nexistence of differing standards of measuring  and\r\n\r\nevaluating  conduct. It must be pointed  out  that\r\n\r\nsuch  evaluation of conduct has validity  only  in\r\n\r\nthe context of where it occurs, how it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccurs, what personalities are involved and  under\r\n\r\nwhat   social   circumstances  such   conduct   is\r\n\r\ndisplayed.  In an oriental society  we  would  say\r\n\r\nthat a departure from the accepted norms of sexual\r\n\r\npractices  is  contrary to our customs  and  would\r\n\r\nconsequently produce harmful effects on  us,  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we would insist on conformity  in  such\r\n\r\nmatters as I have mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our island state, strategically placed as it is\r\n\r\nat  the  cross-roads  of the East  and  West,  has\r\n\r\nbecome  almost a melting pot for various races  to\r\n\r\nmix  and  rub  shoulders.  We  now  enjoy  a  mild\r\n\r\neconomic   boom,  but  apparently  the  Republic's\r\n\r\neconomic  success  has gone  to  the  heads  of  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable segment of our more affluent  youths.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these are the youths  who  set  the\r\n\r\ntrends  and  the  pace  which  are  too  willingly\r\n\r\nimitated   by  our  less  affluent  youths,   with\r\n\r\ndisastrous consequences. I say so because the more\r\n\r\naffluent youths of our society are, on the  whole,\r\n\r\nbetter  educated and consequently are in a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to apprise their actions than  the  less\r\n\r\naffluent  youths.  The  former  are  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to recover from their misdeeds and  more\r\n\r\nquickly  than  could  the  latter.  That   is   my\r\n\r\nassessment.  I must say that there are  more  less\r\n\r\nfortunately placed youths than the rich ones,  and\r\n\r\nwhatever  these  youths do might  have  more  far-reaching  repercussions  upon  our  society.  They\r\n\r\nmight  not  be trend-setters or pace-setters,  but\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that they uncritically ape and  imitate\r\n\r\nthe ways of the less inhibited affluent youths  is\r\n\r\nan  indication of the trends towards a society the\r\n\r\nprincipal    characteristic    of     which     is\r\n\r\npermissiveness.   These  youths,   I   feel,   are\r\n\r\nalienated   from  society  due  to   a   lack   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  their  roles.  This   lack   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of their roles, in my  opinion,  is\r\n\r\nattributed in a large measure to some deficiencies\r\n\r\nin  our society. The people that count-parents and\r\n\r\nteachers,  community leaders  and  certain  public\r\n\r\nfigures  in industry and commerce-have  failed  to\r\n\r\nimbue in our youths the feeling that living  in  a\r\n\r\ndeveloping society such as ours would need them to\r\n\r\nsacrifice their pleasures and devote much of their\r\n\r\ntime  and energy towards more constructive efforts\r\n\r\nrather\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan the mere pursuit of mundane pleasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr C. V. Devan Nair, the N.T.U.C. Secretary-General, had occasion last year to mention the\r\n\r\ndanger  of becoming complacent about the  economic\r\n\r\nand  social success of Singapore. He mentioned the\r\n\r\nincreasing  proneness to insular  smugness,  self-satisfaction   and  self-centredness   which   was\r\n\r\ncompletely  unjustified because Singaporeans  live\r\n\r\nin  one of the hottest trouble spots of the world.\r\n\r\nAs   a   remedial  measure  to  ensure  that  such\r\n\r\ncomplacency is shattered, he suggested that \"large\r\n\r\ntherapeutic doses of geopolitical realism was  the\r\n\r\nonly  way the distorted and self-satisfied insular\r\n\r\nperspectives could be corrected. Only then can we,\r\n\r\nas  a  people, get our priorities right.\" I cannot\r\n\r\nbut  agree with what has been said by Mr Nair.  It\r\n\r\nwould  seem  to me that only the most concentrated\r\n\r\nefforts on our part are necessary to instil in our\r\n\r\nyouths  the  need  for  an  understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nrealities  of  our situation. We must,  if  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  jolt  our people into  a  serious  and\r\n\r\nthoughtful mood. We must ask ourselves if  we  can\r\n\r\nsurvive  as  a  nation without the ingredients  of\r\n\r\nnational  survival,  national unity  and  national\r\n\r\nprogress. We must ask ourselves how the  poor  can\r\n\r\nbe  uplifted from their poverty, and how  everyone\r\n\r\nof  us here can be secure in our society. We  must\r\n\r\nask  ourselves how we can ensure that  the  racial\r\n\r\nsensitivities of our people are not hurt, and  how\r\n\r\nwe  can  inculcate  in  our youths  a  feeling  of\r\n\r\nloyalty  to  this  country. These  are  imperative\r\n\r\nquestions  and our answers to them  pave  the  way\r\n\r\neither to progress and prosperity, or to chaos and\r\n\r\ndestruction.  An  awareness of all  these  in  our\r\n\r\nyouths  may conceivably lead to a shedding of  the\r\n\r\nfetishes they have so uncritically taken from  the\r\n\r\nmore irrational aspects of Western culture. In  my\r\n\r\nopinion, in the interest of our survival, governed\r\n\r\nas  we  are  by the imperatives of the moment,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  set  up the machinery to re-educate  our\r\n\r\nyouths  in the ways that point to our survival  as\r\n\r\nan  entity. Such practices as the sporting of long\r\n\r\nhair,  the smoking of ganja, the taking of  drugs,\r\n\r\nthe wearing of outlandish sartorial fashions and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  like are alien to our way of life and  cannot\r\n\r\nfill the cultural and spiritual vacuum that we are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to experience today. In other words,  we\r\n\r\nmust  have our priorities right, and to do  so  we\r\n\r\nmust develop in ourselves a capacity to understand\r\n\r\nthe day-to-day implications of the significance of\r\n\r\nevents  that  move around us, around  our  nation,\r\n\r\naround  our people and around our region. We  must\r\n\r\nbe  proud  of  our own respective  cultures,  only\r\n\r\ndrawing   upon  other  sources  that  enrich   and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  them.  We must discard  anything  that\r\n\r\ntends  to  enervate and encourage  the  growth  of\r\n\r\nothers that give new impetus to the development of\r\n\r\nour  own. In this way, we can not only ensure  the\r\n\r\ncontinued survival of our cultures, but also their\r\n\r\nstrength,  so that they become the source  of  our\r\n\r\nown  power, the fountain of our creative  energies\r\n\r\nand  the guarantor of our civilization. Our youths\r\n\r\nmust  be  made aware of this, as such an awareness\r\n\r\nis the catalyst to pride and joy in being nurtured\r\n\r\nto  full manhood, through an appreciation  of  the\r\n\r\nachievements   of   our   forefathers,   of    the\r\n\r\ntribulations they underwent, and of their triumphs\r\n\r\nin the face of great adversities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Asia today is poised for great changes.\r\n\r\nWe  are part of these changes and we are in  them.\r\n\r\nIf  the  sixties have given us much, we can expect\r\n\r\nmore  from the seventies but we need to develop  a\r\n\r\nmaturity of understanding so that, in anticipation\r\n\r\nof  these  great  changes, we are not  looking  at\r\n\r\nthings  through  the perspective  of  a  stagnant,\r\n\r\nbackward  and un-progressive society. The dynamics\r\n\r\nof  survival  in a turbulent corner of  the  world\r\n\r\nshould  serve  as  a  spur  to  us  to  accelerate\r\n\r\nperformance  in all the fields of human  endeavour\r\n\r\nso that, in a world torn by strife and dissension,\r\n\r\nwe can serve as a beacon, as a light for others to\r\n\r\nemulate and to follow. Our youths must know  this,\r\n\r\nand  they  must  realise that the  imperatives  of\r\n\r\nsurvival  are  paramount and must take  precedence\r\n\r\nover  all else. The alternative to this awareness,\r\n\r\nI think, is stagnancy and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have already spoken at some length on\r\n\r\nthe  inherent  dangers  that permissive  attitudes\r\n\r\nhave   or  dangers  that  can  result  from  being\r\n\r\npermissive. I have now to go a little further into\r\n\r\nthe  matter. By being non-permissive, it must  not\r\n\r\nbe construed that I am advocating that our society\r\n\r\nshould  be a closed one. There is always the  fear\r\n\r\nthat  if  one  is  not  permissive,  then  one  is\r\n\r\nlogically authoritarian. This does not necessarily\r\n\r\nfollow if we understand that in being disciplined,\r\n\r\none  proceeds  in a manner socially acceptable  in\r\n\r\ngoing about one's business, and that none of one's\r\n\r\nactions are outside the framework of the norm. The\r\n\r\nquestion of permissiveness does not arise here, as\r\n\r\nwhat one is doing is within the accepted framework\r\n\r\nof   social   conventions.   For   instance,   all\r\n\r\nlegitimate intellectual endeavours must  not  only\r\n\r\nbe  sanctioned  but  encouraged  and  nurtured  as\r\n\r\nfurthering  our own cause. In matters of  cultural\r\n\r\npursuits,  any  that  does  not  conduce  to   the\r\n\r\nfurtherance of our culture should he frowned upon.\r\n\r\nA body of ideas, be they philosophical, religious,\r\n\r\npolitical  and economic, which do not run  counter\r\n\r\nto  the  general welfare of the masses,  that  is,\r\n\r\nthey  are not inimical to the state, ought  to  be\r\n\r\nsupported. That is my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, a pragmatic approach to\r\n\r\nthe  complex mechanics of survival should  be  the\r\n\r\ncriterion  with  which we judge our  actions.  Our\r\n\r\nyouths  should  be  critically  discriminating  in\r\n\r\ntheir   choice  of  Western  ways.  The  perennial\r\n\r\nquestions to ask are: Are these useful to  us?  Do\r\n\r\nthey  conduce  to the overall development  of  our\r\n\r\nstate? Do they lift us to a higher stage of  life?\r\n\r\nIf  the  answers  are in the negative,  we  should\r\n\r\ninstantly reject such ways and be emphatic in  our\r\n\r\ndenunciation  of  them. Any  protagonist  for  the\r\n\r\nadoption of such ideas must be out of his mind and\r\n\r\nhe  must quickly be put right before the youths of\r\n\r\nour   state  are  corrupted.  After  all,  certain\r\n\r\naspects  of our life have a more permanent  value:\r\n\r\nrespect  for  our  elders,  personal  honesty  and\r\n\r\nintegrity are universal qualities. On the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother hand, such qualities can be mocked at and be\r\n\r\nlooked upon as quaint survival of a past age,  but\r\n\r\nwhat  substitutes can we have for  them?  Can  the\r\n\r\ntransitory    pleasures   of   the    pipe,    the\r\n\r\nirrationalism of hippie behaviour and  psychedelic\r\n\r\nmusic  replace  the more lasting  satisfaction  of\r\n\r\nhaving  honestly done a day's work?  Only  a  sick\r\n\r\nsociety  can  permit itself to  be  permissive  in\r\n\r\nmatters that mean the difference between life  and\r\n\r\ndeath.  Only  a sick nation can be indifferent  to\r\n\r\nthe  destructive forces that are in its midst. And\r\n\r\nonly  a  nation  that has ceased to  struggle  can\r\n\r\ntolerate a philosophy that extols the qualities of\r\n\r\nnegativism. We live in a state of constant change,\r\n\r\nof  tension, of an incessant urgency to  improvise\r\n\r\nand innovate. Surely the more reasonable approach,\r\n\r\nand  perhaps  the  only logical  approach  to  our\r\n\r\nproblems,  is  the cultivation of the  virtues  of\r\n\r\nleading a more Spartan life. The vital question is\r\n\r\nto  know our priorities. Here we cannot be in  two\r\n\r\nframes of mind. We know in which direction we  are\r\n\r\nheading,  and this awareness should determine  the\r\n\r\npace and the trends of our developmental patterns.\r\n\r\nOur  priorities will dictate our policies and they\r\n\r\nwill, taking precedence over all others, determine\r\n\r\nthe shape of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we gather once again to examine  the\r\n\r\npast and to plan for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a democracy, Parliament has a solemn duty to\r\n\r\nthe  people, as the decisions made in this Chamber\r\n\r\nwill  gravely  affect their livelihood.

This will guide us in our work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me thank the Government for\r\n\r\nassuring us that, as soon as we can ascertain  and\r\n\r\novercome  the  overall  effects  of  the   British\r\n\r\nmilitary  withdrawal, we will rethink  and  adjust\r\n\r\nour  existing wage policy. I hope and believe that\r\n\r\nthis is not an electioneering tactic, but a clear-cut acknowledgment of our workers' contribution to\r\n\r\nour  country's economic growth. In the  past,  our\r\n\r\nworkers   have  worked  hard,  accepted   stricter\r\n\r\ndiscipline  and contributed much to  our  nation's\r\n\r\neconomic  progress.  Foreign and  local  investors\r\n\r\nhave  obtained good returns for their investments.\r\n\r\nIt  is  now time for us to consider rewarding  our\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to make a rethink of our policy to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  we are able to distribute the fruits of  our\r\n\r\nprogress more fairly and equally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that our people, especially\r\n\r\nthose  in  the  front line of the \"battle\"  -  our\r\n\r\nworkers  - can now relax. Far from it. We have  to\r\n\r\nwork harder to get better results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a progressive society, our immediate task is\r\n\r\nto  afford  better and up-to-date  facilities  for\r\n\r\nworkers  to  learn  and acquire better  skills  in\r\n\r\nkeeping   with   the  progress  in   science   and\r\n\r\ntechnology. This is one sure way of increasing our\r\n\r\nworkers'  productivity  and  contributing  to  our\r\n\r\ncountry's  future progress. This will  be  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the people as a whole and  they  can\r\n\r\nmake further and greater contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot hope to continue for long to attract\r\n\r\nforeign investments by providing cheap labour with\r\n\r\nthe blood and sweat of our workers. We have to  be\r\n\r\nproud of our right-thinking workers who are better\r\n\r\nequipped  and  skilled in attracting  foreign  and\r\n\r\nlocal  investors and in carrying out the  task  of\r\n\r\nensuring our survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider it to be unwise to attach too much\r\n\r\nemphasis on widening the gap between the rich  and\r\n\r\nthe poor as conducive to economic growth. This may\r\n\r\nbe  applicable to countries dependent  on  foreign\r\n\r\naid  where many economic theorists gain honour for\r\n\r\nadvocating  such  thinking.  Such  thinking   will\r\n\r\ninevitably  strengthen the roots of a  society  in\r\n\r\nwhich  man  will  exploit man. It  advocates  that\r\n\r\nhuman  beings  should  worry only  about  material\r\n\r\ngains  and discard the higher ideals of  life.  It\r\n\r\nconverts  society  into  a  gathering  place   for\r\n\r\nmonsters  and  walking dead.  It  denies  man  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to develop normal relations  with  his\r\n\r\nfellowman,  and,  in  so doing,  affords  economic\r\n\r\naggressors    the    opportunity    to     exploit\r\n\r\ncontradictions  between  men.  Finally,  it   will\r\n\r\ndegrade  the  poor working-class to the  level  of\r\n\r\nlabouring  tools  for  the  rich,  who  are   only\r\n\r\nconscious  of  their ability to work and  produce.\r\n\r\nThe  end  result  of  their hard  work  will  only\r\n\r\nenhance the growth of the pyramid of wealth of the\r\n\r\nrich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think this is agreeable to hon.

In order\r\n\r\nto  achieve  a higher growth rate of our  GNP,  we\r\n\r\nhave  not paid enough attention to the more subtle\r\n\r\n\"social   cost\"  involved.  This  is   regrettable\r\n\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to look boldly at the problems,\r\n\r\nand the following are basic guide-lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We have not reached the stage of some of the\r\n\r\nmore affluent countries. To a certain extent,  our\r\n\r\npeople  are  still  preoccupied  with  the   basic\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  daily subsistence.  We  have  to\r\n\r\ndepend  on further economic growth to elevate  the\r\n\r\nstandard   of  living  of  our  people.   However,\r\n\r\neconomic progress and the protection of a gracious\r\n\r\nliving  environment need not be  contradictory  if\r\n\r\nproper policy planning is made of the use of  land\r\n\r\nand the distribution of population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No environmental planning should run\r\n\r\ncontrary to the intellectual requirements of  man.\r\n\r\nWe    should   primarily   consider   the   proper\r\n\r\ndevelopment of interrelations between communities,\r\n\r\nand between man and his fellowman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) No plans that will curtail the full\r\n\r\ndevelopment of individual potential and add  undue\r\n\r\nstress  and  strain  on the individual  should  be\r\n\r\napproved without sufficient reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We have to emphasise the intangible \"social\r\n\r\ncost\"  involved in the evaluation of any  economic\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The public must have sufficient say in any\r\n\r\nplans affecting their living environment. We  have\r\n\r\nto  encourage public participation in our planning\r\n\r\nprocess  and  not  be  solely  dependent  on   the\r\n\r\ntechnocrats and experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, urban renewal is meant partly to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  living  conditions  of  our  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  our urban renewal planning  should  be\r\n\r\nmade to suit the needs of the people. The best way\r\n\r\nto  do  this  would be constantly to  consult  and\r\n\r\nlisten to the views of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) As problems relating to the environment and\r\n\r\nanti-pollution   measures   are    involved    and\r\n\r\nextensive, we have to rely on the co-operation  of\r\n\r\nthe   more   advanced  countries  for   up-to-date\r\n\r\ntechniques in these fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) In any anti-pollution measure, we have to\r\n\r\nstress more on the educational aspects than depend\r\n\r\nheavily  on the enforcement of the law. I  believe\r\n\r\nwe will make progress in these fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of anti-pollution measures reminds me of\r\n\r\nour water problem. I think we have to try to solve\r\n\r\nit from three directions, namely, by:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) increasing our sources of water supply and\r\n\r\nensuring that these sources are not polluted;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) strengthening our water management\r\n\r\ntechniques,  and employing up-to-date  methods  in\r\n\r\nthe case of water management; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) educating our citizens on the value of\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any programme aimed at increasing our\r\n\r\nsources of water supply is expensive. Very careful\r\n\r\nconsideration must therefore be given to prevent a\r\n\r\nwrong decision being taken. Most of the scientific\r\n\r\nmethods of water purification and desalination are\r\n\r\nstill  in  the  experimental stage, although  much\r\n\r\nresearch  and  progress have  been  made  in  this\r\n\r\nfield. I agree we should not attempt to adopt  any\r\n\r\nscheme  that  has not been tried on an  industrial\r\n\r\nscale elsewhere. We cannot afford to experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the P.U.B, has assigned specialists to\r\n\r\nstudy the water problems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  as  not to make any grave mistake. Any mistake\r\n\r\nwe  make  in  this  respect will cause  us  severe\r\n\r\nfinancial losses and we may not have the  time  to\r\n\r\nmake good our losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of water management, I think we\r\n\r\nshould send some of our younger technicians to the\r\n\r\nmore  advanced  countries  to  study  and  acquire\r\n\r\nexpertise.   Water   management   techniques   are\r\n\r\nprogressing  at a fast pace. We cannot  expect  to\r\n\r\ntackle these problems by staying stagnant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of our security, and in ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  our  future generation will  have  a  better\r\n\r\nchance  of  survival, we cannot fail. We  have  to\r\n\r\neducate  actively our people to preserve and  care\r\n\r\nfor  our water supplies. Within limits, incentives\r\n\r\nmust  be given to those who are exemplary in  this\r\n\r\nrespect. I think the Government must work harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-racial country like Singapore, anyone\r\n\r\nwho,   wittingly  or  unwittingly,   ignores   the\r\n\r\npotential  danger  of  fooling  around  with   the\r\n\r\nlanguage issue is looking for trouble. Anyone  who\r\n\r\nwants  to stir up communal frustration is  playing\r\n\r\nwith  a time-bomb which, when exploded, will  hurt\r\n\r\nthe  player first. This will do nobody  any  good.\r\n\r\nWhen  an  individual or group  displays  any  such\r\n\r\ntendency, it is the duty of the Government to  put\r\n\r\na stop to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has pledged to treat equally all\r\n\r\nthe  four languages, religions and races.  In  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  people,  we  have  to   support\r\n\r\nunreservedly  the  Government's  efforts  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.   Of   course,  we  also   expect   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  demonstrate,  in   concrete   and\r\n\r\ntangible form, this policy of equality for all the\r\n\r\nraces, languages and religions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of the governing party, I call on\r\n\r\nthe   Government   leaders  and   those   directly\r\n\r\nconnected  with  us  to  demonstrate  unreservedly\r\n\r\ntheir faith in this policy. No one irrespective of\r\n\r\nhis  position, must be allowed to be  hypocritical\r\n\r\nabout  this  and make statements contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's proclaimed policy. Otherwise we  will\r\n\r\nonly  increase our enemy's firing power and weaken\r\n\r\nour own camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not we can produce in as short a time\r\n\r\nas  possible  a good number of young  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nconversant in two or more than two languages  will\r\n\r\ndetermine  to  a  large  extent  our  chances   of\r\n\r\nsurvival  as  a sovereign country. Of  course,  we\r\n\r\nwill  require  the younger generation  to  receive\r\n\r\ntheir  education first in their mother tongue  and\r\n\r\nthen  learn  a  second, or even a third  language.\r\n\r\nHistory  has shown that through the \"mother-tongue\r\n\r\neducation\",  we  have been able to  produce  hard-working  and  proud  \"sons of Singapore\".  In  our\r\n\r\nhistory,   the  majority  of  those   who   fought\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and  stayed  at  the  front  line  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  on the factory  floor  are  the\r\n\r\nproducts of the \"mother-tongue education\". Without\r\n\r\nthem, we would not be here today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language problem is a sensitive one. When\r\n\r\ntrying  to  examine  the  problem,  no  amount  of\r\n\r\nhysterical outcry will help. Similarly,  to  clamp\r\n\r\ndown  on  the  discussion of the problem  is  also\r\n\r\nunwise   as  this  will  only  sweep  the  problem\r\n\r\nunderground temporarily. Both these methods can be\r\n\r\nexploited by our enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take as an example the case of one of our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries. They have mismanaged their\r\n\r\nlanguage  problem.  At one stage  they  encouraged\r\n\r\nopen  and  unreserved discussion.  They  got  into\r\n\r\ntrouble and many people were killed. They then had\r\n\r\nto stop the discussion by force and ultimately had\r\n\r\nto impose a constitutional clamp on discussions of\r\n\r\nsuch   issues.  Their  mismanagement  had   caused\r\n\r\nirreparable damage to their own country!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider the best way to solve the question is\r\n\r\nby   a   concrete  and  tangible  policy  and   to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  our faith and belief  that  a  multi-racial approach is the only workable solution.  We\r\n\r\nhave to be sober and alive to the problem from the\r\n\r\nlong-term point of view and interest. This  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  a  simple problem, otherwise there  would  not\r\n\r\nhave been so much bloodshed all over the world  on\r\n\r\nsuch  issues. However, it is a problem  that  will\r\n\r\ndecide our survival and we have to face up to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn my attention to the problems of\r\n\r\nour youth. This is also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelated  to  the  problems of  continuity  in  our\r\n\r\nleadership. No government can escape this problem.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the Government to lead our youth\r\n\r\nalong the path of righteousness and pro, vide  our\r\n\r\ncountry with vitality so that our progress can  be\r\n\r\nfurther enhanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us admit that our young people are no\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  others. They are never  satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the present realities of life. They ask  for\r\n\r\nchanges  which may be considered extreme. If  they\r\n\r\ndo    not    have   ways   of   expressing    such\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction,   they   will   develop   certain\r\n\r\ntendencies    that   might   well   destroy    the\r\n\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, in view of our material prosperity\r\n\r\nand   also   because   of  the   overemphasis   on\r\n\r\nmaterialistic  achievements, such youthful  desire\r\n\r\nfor  changes may not be apparent. However, is  not\r\n\r\nthe  path  taken by the youth in some of  the  so-called advanced countries an eye-opener to us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This temporary phenomenon, which runs contrary\r\n\r\nto human nature, will soon come to pass. Our youth\r\n\r\nwill  soon  wake  up.  No  one  has  succeeded  in\r\n\r\nsuppressing the problems of youth by force or  the\r\n\r\nerosion  of their enthusiasm by harmful  cultures.\r\n\r\nThis can only exacerbate their resentment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with young people being\r\n\r\nenthusiastic  and  idealistic.  It  is   precisely\r\n\r\nbecause members of our present Government in their\r\n\r\nyoung days were prepared to be \"action-packed\" and\r\n\r\nwilling to fight for their ideals that we have the\r\n\r\nSingapore of today. Therefore, we have to call  on\r\n\r\nour young people to be prepared to make sacrifices\r\n\r\nfor  the cause of high ideals. Then and only  then\r\n\r\ncan  they  contribute  and  bring  us  to  greater\r\n\r\nheights of achievements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just what do we see? Our society is one of\r\n\r\nglorifying  in greater materialistic  achievements\r\n\r\nand of encouraging achievements without regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  rightness  of the means employed  to  achieve\r\n\r\nthem.  There  is a lack of ideals and respect  for\r\n\r\nthe  better  side  of  human  life.  We  have  not\r\n\r\nprovided our youth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  right atmosphere and infrastructure  to\r\n\r\nconstructively bring about changes for the better.\r\n\r\nIn  their  upbringing, as it were,  we  have  only\r\n\r\ninculcated  in them the ability to listen  and  to\r\n\r\nfollow,  and not the ability to question and  find\r\n\r\nout the truth. Are we moving backwards? It is time\r\n\r\nfor us to ponder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, quite a few years have passed\r\n\r\nwithout  any opposition in this House.  Obviously,\r\n\r\nthe  people  will pass judgment on our performance\r\n\r\nunder  these  circumstances.  The  surest  way  to\r\n\r\ndestroy  Singapore  is to deny  the  people  their\r\n\r\nrights  under  a  democracy.  Our  task  as  loyal\r\n\r\nBackbenchers  is  made more than  difficult  under\r\n\r\nexisting  conditions. Luckily, both the Government\r\n\r\nand  we  ourselves possess sufficient  courage  to\r\n\r\naccept   criticism  and  are   willing   to   make\r\n\r\nadjustments where necessary in the interest of our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the recent announcement by the\r\n\r\nGovernment to increase the compensation for  those\r\n\r\naffected  by  resettlement and  new  measures  for\r\n\r\ntackling the hawkers' problems are laudable.  They\r\n\r\nmust not be taken to be electioneering tactics but\r\n\r\na demonstration of the Government's will to submit\r\n\r\nto  the wishes of the people, and the Government's\r\n\r\nprofound    understanding    of    the    people's\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years to come, the Government will have\r\n\r\nto  strengthen  its resources in ascertaining  the\r\n\r\nviews  of the people to ensure that they  will  be\r\n\r\nattended  to.  This will enhance  our  chances  of\r\n\r\nsurviving as a united nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporters and editors of the press must know\r\n\r\ntheir  obligations  to the people  under  existing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   Similarly,   I   call   on    the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  through its Ministry of  Culture,  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the social status of our journalists  and\r\n\r\nwriters,  They  are able, to a  great  extent,  to\r\n\r\nreflect  and  bring forward the  thinking  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  We  ask them to fulfil their obligations.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  must also recognise  their  social\r\n\r\nstatus.  This  is  one  of  our  basic  tasks   in\r\n\r\nprotecting   and  enhancing  the  principles   and\r\n\r\npractice of democracy in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will be naive enough to deny the inevitable\r\n\r\nreturn of opposition to this Chamber. But we  must\r\n\r\nannihilate  all those who are working for  foreign\r\n\r\ninterests   and  wish  to  gain  ground   in   cur\r\n\r\nconfusion.  We  should also not  allow  anyone  to\r\n\r\ndisrupt the unity of our people on the pretext  of\r\n\r\nairing democratic views but with sinister motives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, people of all descriptions have been\r\n\r\nbusily  organising  political parties.  Some  pro-labour  intellectuals  are even  airing  the  view\r\n\r\nthat, as they are uncertain of the political stand\r\n\r\nof  the successors to the present Government, they\r\n\r\npropose  that  at  some  opportune  time   a   new\r\n\r\npolitical  party  should be organised  to  protect\r\n\r\nlabour  interest.  All these  are  adding  colour,\r\n\r\nconfusion   and  complications  to  the  political\r\n\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come what may, the Government must fearlessly\r\n\r\ncarry  out  its  policies in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\nbasic  interest of our people. In the  end,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure our people will solidly give their support to\r\n\r\nthose who are working in their interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an era when President Nixon, the leader\r\n\r\nof  a nation proud of its military might, will  be\r\n\r\nvisiting  China,  a country that  thrives  on  the\r\n\r\nsheer  will of her people. In such an era  let  us\r\n\r\nkeep  reminding  ourselves that no  other  country\r\n\r\nowes it to us that we should survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only we ourselves can ensure our own chances of\r\n\r\nsurvival, and if we fail there will be no  one  to\r\n\r\nregret our destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion moved by the\r\n\r\nMember for Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to refer to a particular statement  in\r\n\r\nthe  President's  speech, and generally  voice  my\r\n\r\nthoughts on it. The President has declared, \"If we\r\n\r\nare   to   remain  a  cohesive  people,  we   must\r\n\r\nconcentrate on the factors which bind us together,\r\n\r\nand not those which will divide us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us view some possible areas in the life\r\n\r\nof our people wherein we may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhighlight those factors which tend to unite us. We\r\n\r\nmay then decide to stress the development of those\r\n\r\nunifying features of our society. Perhaps  we  can\r\n\r\ndiscern  more clearly such areas of common purpose\r\n\r\nif  we bear in mind the aspiration and striving of\r\n\r\nour  people for a better and ever better  life  in\r\n\r\nall  ways.  One  such  important  area  of  common\r\n\r\nstriving is the area of the economic life  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At work, Sir, co-operation between workers and\r\n\r\nmanagement  continues to be  crucial  to  economic\r\n\r\nprogress.  One  significant  way  in  which   such\r\n\r\ncooperation  can be fostered is in  the  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  through  which  the  quality  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nproducts   may  be  ensured,  thus  resulting   in\r\n\r\nincreased productivity. To do this, the experience\r\n\r\nof  our  workers  will have to be married  to  the\r\n\r\nskill of our managers and technologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I therefore welcome the\r\n\r\ndeclaration  in  the addendum to  the  President's\r\n\r\nspeech  related  to the Ministry  of  Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology  to  the effect that  among  incentives\r\n\r\nbeing   considered  to  stimulate   research   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  industrial  sector  is   the\r\n\r\npossible  provision of tax relief for  expenditure\r\n\r\non  equipment  and  technical  manpower  used  for\r\n\r\nquality control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management should take advantage of such\r\n\r\nincentives  when  they are offered.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  after  management has been  persuaded  into\r\n\r\nintroducing  quality control and  maintaining  it,\r\n\r\nthe  benefits of increased productivity should  be\r\n\r\npassed   on   to  workers,  who  will  also   have\r\n\r\nincentives  to co-operate in the progress  of  the\r\n\r\nenterprise  they  work  in.  Here,   it   may   be\r\n\r\ninteresting to note the success of quality control\r\n\r\ncircles  in  Japan  where such circles  have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced.  It would appear that the Q.C, circle\r\n\r\nis  \"a group of workers and their supervisor,  who\r\n\r\norganise themselves for the purpose of working  on\r\n\r\na  specific quality control problem related to the\r\n\r\nwork of their section of the plant.\" (I am quoting\r\n\r\nfrom  page  1 of a little publication  called  The\r\n\r\nQuality  Control  Circle by  a  Professor  Niland,\r\n\r\npublished in 1971, in collaboration with the Asian\r\n\r\nProductivity Organisation.) I notice from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  perusal  of this little book that great  praise\r\n\r\nhas  been lavished on the achievement of the  Q.C.\r\n\r\nCircle  movement. Perhaps, Sir, we should  take  a\r\n\r\ncloser look at this concept of co-operation to see\r\n\r\nif it will work in our own industrial situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another machinery of industrial cooperation is\r\n\r\nthe  Works  Council.  I understand  that  a  Works\r\n\r\nCouncil   is   intended  to  bring  about   direct\r\n\r\ncommunication  between workers and management  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of promoting understanding and better\r\n\r\nindustrial  relaxations between the  two  parties.\r\n\r\nEvery support and encouragement should be given to\r\n\r\nsuch   consultative  bodies  aimed  at   promoting\r\n\r\nharmonious    relations   between   workers    and\r\n\r\nmanagement,   as  such  a  relationship   conduces\r\n\r\ntowards  industrial efficiency, and is yet another\r\n\r\nintegrative feature in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area in which we can, and indeed must,\r\n\r\ngenerate  attention to the factors which  bind  us\r\n\r\ntogether  is the area of urban living.  Very  soon\r\n\r\nhalf  our people will be living in flats and high-rise   dwellings   built  by   the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. In such dwellings multitudes of\r\n\r\nour  people  live  in  dense  proximity,  not  the\r\n\r\naverage 8,000 to a square mile, but 20,000 or even\r\n\r\n30,00()  to a square mile. We have to arrange  for\r\n\r\nthese people to feel happy where they live, to own\r\n\r\na  sense  of  belonging to their particular  local\r\n\r\ncommunity, to adjust to this way of living and  to\r\n\r\nadapt themselves to one another. Our President has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  approach of  the  Singaporean  to\r\n\r\nproblems  is generally practical and tolerant.  It\r\n\r\nis in the circumstances of close urban living that\r\n\r\nwe have indeed to make the resort to the practical\r\n\r\nand  tolerant  solutions to  problems,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  affecting  human relations,  ingrained  and\r\n\r\nspontaneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we do this? Our various campaigns to keep\r\n\r\nSingapore clean and green, and pollution free, and\r\n\r\nto  conserve water will have tended to make people\r\n\r\nmore  conscious of their responsibilities  one  to\r\n\r\nanother.  We should constantly remind  our  people\r\n\r\nwho live\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrowdedly close to one another that they  have  to\r\n\r\nshow  fraternal consideration for one  another  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  noise,  litter,  cleanliness  and   a\r\n\r\ngeneral   sense   of  community  well-being,   the\r\n\r\nunderstanding of one another's sensitivities,  and\r\n\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember having occasionally watched a T.V.\r\n\r\nprogramme  in Chinese which depicted  episodes  in\r\n\r\nthe lives of some who lived in H.D.B, flats. Would\r\n\r\nthat  we  had  writers of plays  who  could  aptly\r\n\r\nportray  the  comedy  and drama  of  life  in  our\r\n\r\nhousing  estates.  Not with gauche  propaganda  or\r\n\r\nwith clumsily concealed exhortation, but with  art\r\n\r\nand   subtlety  conveying  the  nuances  of  human\r\n\r\ninteraction. Do not the circumstances of living in\r\n\r\nthe housing estates provide material for satirical\r\n\r\nor  for more serious presentation, so that we  may\r\n\r\nbe  moved to laugh at or ponder over the comedy or\r\n\r\ndrama  of our way of life? Our choreographers  and\r\n\r\nartists  -  could  they  not  be  concerned   with\r\n\r\nincorporating in their creations features that may\r\n\r\nmake  us  sensitive to our circumstances? For  our\r\n\r\nlife - life soon for one out of every two people -\r\n\r\nwill be life in a housing estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, while we are waiting for our poets\r\n\r\nand  artists to get cracking, let us encourage the\r\n\r\nformation of residents' associations in  order  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate   co-operation   and   adjustment    in\r\n\r\ncommunity   living.   Our  Citizens   Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees   and  the  management  committees   of\r\n\r\ncommunity centres are rendering sterling  service.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  a  community, however,  cannot  leave\r\n\r\naction  for  community benefit in the hands  of  a\r\n\r\nfew. It is good for as many people as possible  to\r\n\r\nbe  involved  in  looking after  their  community.\r\n\r\nResidents'  associations will give  a  chance  for\r\n\r\npeople  to  come forward and make their  community\r\n\r\ncontributions, each in his own way. The  only  way\r\n\r\nfor  a  community to develop is through self-help.\r\n\r\nSelf-help  will generate confidence,  self-respect\r\n\r\nand a sense of belonging to a community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the ancillary help of residents'\r\n\r\nassociations   our  community   centres   may   be\r\n\r\nrevitalised.  There are many useful services  that\r\n\r\ncan be mobilised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough   the   community   centre   organisation.\r\n\r\nSupervised study can be arranged for children  who\r\n\r\nwould  otherwise  be  distracted  by  the  crowded\r\n\r\nconditions  in  which they live.  Such  supervised\r\n\r\nstudy  may  be held at a school near the community\r\n\r\ncentre  and near the housing estate, in  the  same\r\n\r\ncircumstances   as  supervised   study   sessions,\r\n\r\nopportunities may be provided for children to have\r\n\r\noral practice in their second language. One of the\r\n\r\nreasons   why  second-language  studies   are   so\r\n\r\nretarded  today is the dearth of opportunities  to\r\n\r\nhave oral practice in the second language. For the\r\n\r\npurpose of both supervised study as well as second-language  practice, the resources of a  particular\r\n\r\ncommunity  may  well  be sufficient  for  its  own\r\n\r\nneeds.  Office workers, older students,  teachers,\r\n\r\nretired people - all sorts of people living  in  a\r\n\r\ncommunity  may  be persuaded to volunteer  a  very\r\n\r\nmodest bit of their time. But a sense of community\r\n\r\nmust be developed to sustain these contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop a sense of identity with a\r\n\r\nlocality,  perhaps a judicious  sense  of  rivalry\r\n\r\nwith  other  localities could  also  be  generated\r\n\r\nthrough  games, friendly matches, debates, raising\r\n\r\nof  scholarships to send children or residents for\r\n\r\nspecial  or higher education, and so on.  Anything\r\n\r\nthat can give a distinctness to a community should\r\n\r\nbe   fostered.  But  never  a  sense  of   jarring\r\n\r\ncompetition!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the possibilities are adequately exploited,\r\n\r\nresidents'  associations could well  be  a  social\r\n\r\ninstitution  of  some significance  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAlready   we   have  had  examples  of  residents'\r\n\r\nassociations organising for security in precincts,\r\n\r\nor to protest against an increase in property tax,\r\n\r\nto help the consumers' movement, to arrange events\r\n\r\nfor the children of residents, and so on. What  is\r\n\r\nneeded is a sustained life of such associations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allied with close living is the problem of\r\n\r\nrecreation,  in our society there is a  grave  and\r\n\r\nnecessary emphasis on work orientation. There  has\r\n\r\nnot  been, in my view, adequate realisation of the\r\n\r\nimportance  also of leisure. Ours has  been  to  a\r\n\r\nfair extent a Spartan emphasis. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuseful  to note that as long as the Spartans  were\r\n\r\ngeared for strife they flourished, but as soon  as\r\n\r\nthey   experienced  prosperity   they   began   to\r\n\r\ndegenerate. I think it was Aristotle who said that\r\n\r\nthe  Spartans were secure as long as they were  at\r\n\r\nwar.  But  they  collapsed when they  acquired  an\r\n\r\nempire. Sebastian de Grazia, author of a, I think,\r\n\r\ndefinitive  work  on leisure, has  stated  that  a\r\n\r\ncitizenry  unprepared for leisure will  degenerate\r\n\r\nin prosperous times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining leisure very simply (I hope this is not\r\n\r\nan  over-simplification), I would  equate  leisure\r\n\r\nwith the time for healthy recreation. I think  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  recreation  is basic  to  man's  nature\r\n\r\ninasmuch as he needs to relax from the effort  and\r\n\r\ntension  of  work  and thus preserve  a  physical,\r\n\r\npsychological  and  spiritual harmony.  There  are\r\n\r\ncertain   aspects  of  compulsion  in   our   work\r\n\r\nsituation.  Recreational activities and  interests\r\n\r\nare  chosen  freely and thus they meet more  fully\r\n\r\npeople's  needs and predispositions. Work  is  not\r\n\r\nalways  compatible with temperament and the hidden\r\n\r\ncravings  of  the worker. Recreation as  a  safety\r\n\r\nvalve is thus essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important is the fact that recreation\r\n\r\nprovides all sorts of opportunities for our people\r\n\r\nto  come  together in the social  and  integrative\r\n\r\natmosphere of recreational activities. When people\r\n\r\nare  living  in close proximity, their  collective\r\n\r\ninstincts   seek   expression.   A   desire    for\r\n\r\nassociation      is     enhanced.     Recreational\r\n\r\nopportunities    are    therefore,     in     such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, not merely desirable but essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another argument for greater urgency to be given\r\n\r\nto  the  provision of recreational  facilities  is\r\n\r\nthat    cultural   interaction,   tolerance    and\r\n\r\nbroadmindedness  all  result from  the  influences\r\n\r\nthat people exert on one another. I have heard  of\r\n\r\nplans  to  organise recreation on  a  constituency\r\n\r\nbasis. It is important that such plans are brought\r\n\r\nto  early  fruition. I am sure  various  Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative    Committees,    community    centre\r\n\r\norganisation's and associations of residents and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouse-owners  in  Housing  and  Development  Board\r\n\r\nestates  could  be  got  to  co-operate  in   such\r\n\r\nenterprises  yielding yet another opportunity  for\r\n\r\ncollaboration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we must have are more areas set aside\r\n\r\nfor  recreation - for basketball courts, badminton\r\n\r\nhalls,  swimming pools and the like.  1  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  look a little more closely at our  current\r\n\r\nprovision  of golf courses to see if  this  is  an\r\n\r\neconomic use of land for recreational facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the provision of possibly more\r\n\r\noptimally  used  facilities,  and  with   specific\r\n\r\nreference to my own constituency. I wonder if  the\r\n\r\nspace  enclosed  by the bend of  Mountbatten  Road\r\n\r\nopposite Fort Road may be looked into as  a  venue\r\n\r\nfor  recreation  for  the  people  living  in  the\r\n\r\ncrowded  Tanjong Rhu Housing Estate. When I  think\r\n\r\nof the swimming pools in Queenstown, the badminton\r\n\r\nhall  in Mountbatten and other amenities in  other\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  I feel extremely  envious  and  I\r\n\r\nfeel  impelled  also  to make  representation  for\r\n\r\nadded facilities for those in my constituency  who\r\n\r\nneed  these provisions. At the same time, I  would\r\n\r\nhope  that the pedestrian bridge that I have asked\r\n\r\nto  be  erected  in the vicinity of  the  Tun  Sri\r\n\r\nLanang  School be erected with greater  expedition\r\n\r\nthan  seems  to be demonstrated at present.  Other\r\n\r\nless crowded vicinities have had this facility.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  why  there  should  be  a  delay  in   the\r\n\r\nprovision of this facility in this instance.  This\r\n\r\nbridge  is  necessary also in order to get  people\r\n\r\nacross to recreational facilities which 1 hope may\r\n\r\nbe provided soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another sphere in the organisation of the\r\n\r\nlife   of   our   community,  important   to   its\r\n\r\nintegration,  is  the sphere of  adult  education.\r\n\r\nWhen  people attend adult education classes,  they\r\n\r\nare  united  in  their purpose of improving  their\r\n\r\nlife's  situation.  They experience  an  encounter\r\n\r\nwith   different  views.  They  acquire  a  deeper\r\n\r\nrespect for democratic exchange. They become  more\r\n\r\ndisposed to resort to rationality; yet they imbibe\r\n\r\na pro-founder cultural awareness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More emphasis must be given to adult education,\r\n\r\nespecially    through   our    community    centre\r\n\r\norganisation.  Of  course, the atmosphere  in  the\r\n\r\nadult  education  situations  that  the  community\r\n\r\ncentre  may  provide will be less  formal  than  a\r\n\r\nclassroom  situation, but the  provision  will  be\r\n\r\nvaluable  all  the  same. I suggest  that  regular\r\n\r\nprogrammes   of  community  education   talks   be\r\n\r\nscheduled  at  community centres.  I  have  myself\r\n\r\nhelped  to  get speakers (in Hokkien and  Mandarin\r\n\r\nand  a  coming  one' in Malay) for  talks  at  one\r\n\r\ncommunity   centre.  I  think  these  talks   have\r\n\r\nresulted  in  a worthwhile social and  educational\r\n\r\nexperience for those who attended them,  including\r\n\r\nthe  speakers. The situation that prevails, so far\r\n\r\nas  I  have  noticed up to the present,  is  quite\r\n\r\nunlike that in a classroom, where these talks  are\r\n\r\nconcerned. For one thing, the mothers have brought\r\n\r\ntheir children along. For another, other- children\r\n\r\nhave come along, for the fun of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers have to be provided with\r\n\r\nmicrophones and loudspeakers, and have to  be  the\r\n\r\nbest  available for the topics concerned. We  must\r\n\r\nexpose  the  community to experts. Those  who  are\r\n\r\nacademically disposed are given a chance  to  come\r\n\r\nto grips with Singapore at grass-roots level. I do\r\n\r\nnot  think it beyond the ingenuity of the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  to  get speakers  for  its  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  if  this  idea  of  community  education\r\n\r\nstrikes it as worthwhile pursuing. One thing about\r\n\r\nsuch  talks  as  1  have described,  they  do  not\r\n\r\npossess  a \"campaign\" atmosphere. They are  not  a\r\n\r\nvehicle for propaganda. They are educational.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with these talks and in view of\r\n\r\nthe  growing  necessity  to  get  our  people   to\r\n\r\nunderstand   better   the   operations   of    our\r\n\r\nbureaucracy, I suggest getting the co-operation of\r\n\r\nsenior  civil  servants for  occasional  talks  at\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres,  in  the  situations  I   have\r\n\r\ndescribed, on the work, policy and aims of various\r\n\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another possible use of adult education for\r\n\r\ncommunity  development is the organisation  of  TV\r\n\r\nviewing  groups. This would, of course, depend  on       \r\n\r\nTV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  being  able to provide programmes  that\r\n\r\nwould    lend    themselves   appropriately    for\r\n\r\ndiscussion. At the community centre level, a group\r\n\r\nis organised to watch the programme and to discuss\r\n\r\nthe programme topic further, or even the programme\r\n\r\nitself  if  it  happens  to  be,  for  example,  a\r\n\r\ndramatic presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another area in which a sense of a united\r\n\r\npeople  is  generated is in the area  of  national\r\n\r\nservice.  Not only does the establishment  of  our\r\n\r\ndefence  credibility ensure internal security  and\r\n\r\noffer  a  force that will co-operate readily  with\r\n\r\nothers  to  ensure stability in  our  region,  but\r\n\r\nnational  service also gives opportunity  for  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  be trained together, to work together,\r\n\r\nto  eat  together, and to live together.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  our young people who are called up learn  to\r\n\r\nrub  off,  the  rough  edges of  their  ethnic  or\r\n\r\ncultural   affiliation   and   adjust   themselves\r\n\r\nsmoothly  to the ways and behaviour of  others.  I\r\n\r\nagree with what has been stated in the addendum to\r\n\r\nthe Presidential speech related to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs,  that  a prerequisites  for  our\r\n\r\nsurvival  as  a  distinctive  people  is  national\r\n\r\ncohesiveness, and this cohesiveness  is  certainly\r\n\r\ndeveloping in national service and finds  national\r\n\r\nservice a most appropriate arena to develop in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I come to that humble\r\n\r\narea   of   community   service   in   which   the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  backbencher  operates.

The debate  has\r\n\r\nbeen  lively  and thought-provoking. Although  the\r\n\r\nMembers  in  this  House all belong  to  the  same\r\n\r\nparty,  however,  we,  the Backbenchers,  are  not\r\n\r\nforgetting our role as such. We have been able  to\r\n\r\nmake  certain frank and constructive criticism  of\r\n\r\nthe  implementation  of policies  and  of  certain\r\n\r\naspects of the policies. As the Member for  Katong\r\n\r\nhas  just  said,  many of the  original  views  of\r\n\r\nBackbenchers have been incorporated in the  policy\r\n\r\nspeech. This shows that our Government is able  to\r\n\r\naccept   and  follow  the  views  of  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament,  namely,  those  of  the  people.  Our\r\n\r\nGovernment is elected by the people and its policy\r\n\r\nhas  to be based on the wishes of the people. This\r\n\r\ngoes without saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy speech has inspired and enlightened\r\n\r\nus  and has given us a lot of food for thought. It\r\n\r\nhas  filled us with confidence for the  future  of\r\n\r\nour country, which is the most important aspect of\r\n\r\nit.  It is gratifying to note that after six years\r\n\r\nof independence we have been able to make progress\r\n\r\non  all fronts. However, we must avoid a sense  of\r\n\r\ncomplacency permeating our society. We are just at\r\n\r\nthe initial stage of nation-building. Although  we\r\n\r\nhave  been able to surmount many difficulties  and\r\n\r\nproblems, the tasks ahead and the problems  facing\r\n\r\nus  are still enormous and thorny. They await  our\r\n\r\nresolute  solution,  especially  so  when  we  are\r\n\r\nliving in this region of super-power politics.  As\r\n\r\na  small  island-state, we should he cautious  and\r\n\r\nprudent in our policy and in our actions in  order\r\n\r\nto ensure our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurvival.  Hence, national interest  should  take\r\n\r\npriority   over   everything  else.   Any   force\r\n\r\nthreatening our survival, whether from inside  or\r\n\r\noutside,  should be countered vigorously  by  all\r\n\r\nour people in unison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the inadequacies of our natural\r\n\r\nresources  is  the  limited land  we  have.  This\r\n\r\ncannot be overcome in a short time. Although  our\r\n\r\nreclamation schemes are being carried out day and\r\n\r\nnight,  they take years to complete. In order  to\r\n\r\nkeep  on  progressing and developing, we have  to\r\n\r\nacquire more land to development. On these lands,\r\n\r\nproperties and the means of livelihood, etc, will\r\n\r\nhave  to be resettled elsewhere. It is gratifying\r\n\r\nto  note that the Government could appreciate the\r\n\r\ndifficulties and hardships of the people affected\r\n\r\nby  resettlement.  Recently, the  Government  has\r\n\r\nannounced that higher rates of compensation  will\r\n\r\nbe  awarded to those affected by resettlement. As\r\n\r\nthere  will be financial losses and inconvenience\r\n\r\nresulting  from  resettlement,  those   who   are\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  the  resettlement  scheme  should,\r\n\r\nwhere possible, see that the settlers should  not\r\n\r\nsuffer  any unnecessary hardship. They should  be\r\n\r\nhelped  to  tide over their difficulties  in  the\r\n\r\ntransitional  period to resume their  livelihood.\r\n\r\nThey  should  abide  by these principles  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the last ten years the resettlement\r\n\r\nscheme   has  been  smoothly  carried  out,   the\r\n\r\nResettlement Department, which can boast  of  its\r\n\r\nefficiency,  has  assumed a very  burdensome  and\r\n\r\nonerous  task because of rapid development.  This\r\n\r\nseems to be difficult for the department to  cope\r\n\r\nwith, thus affecting the settlers adversely.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  Jurong,  when  a  certain  area  is\r\n\r\nearmarked  for development, the farmers  in  that\r\n\r\narea  would  like  to move out  to  a  new  place\r\n\r\nquickly,  because  if the period  of  waiting  is\r\n\r\nlong,  they would not be able to carry out  their\r\n\r\nnormal  activities, thus resulting in a reduction\r\n\r\nin  their  income, Also, because  of  reclamation\r\n\r\nwork  around  the  area, some of  the  roads  are\r\n\r\nblocked  out  causing  difficulties  in  traffic.\r\n\r\nBecause of the fleet of lorries conveying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearth  from one place to another, even the  wells\r\n\r\nfrom  where the farmers get their drinking  water\r\n\r\nare polluted. However, these are not the worst of\r\n\r\ntheir  problems.  The  most  distressing  problem\r\n\r\nwhich  is causing the deepest anxiety among  them\r\n\r\nis  that  the ditches and drains are  silted  and\r\n\r\nchoked, causing floods whenever there is a  heavy\r\n\r\ndownpour.  Their  chicken-pens and  pigsties  and\r\n\r\neven  their  dwellings would then  be  soaked  in\r\n\r\nwater,  and  their  crops destroyed.  The  losses\r\n\r\ncould be quite considerable. I have been to  such\r\n\r\nareas and I personally have seen that the ditches\r\n\r\nand  the  drains have been silted and  choked  to\r\n\r\nsuch  an extent that dredging them is impossible.\r\n\r\nThe  only\\ solution to their problems is to  help\r\n\r\nthese farmers resettle in a resettlement area  as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few months ago, when making an\r\n\r\nadjournment  speech in this House. I  touched  on\r\n\r\ncertain   problems   relating  to   resettlement.\r\n\r\nHowever,  these problems have not  been  entirely\r\n\r\nsolved  up to now. The authorities have not  been\r\n\r\nable  to  give  speedy and adequate  compensation\r\n\r\nonce  and for all to the ground squatters in  new\r\n\r\nresettlement  areas.  This  has  given  rise   to\r\n\r\ndisputes   and  confusion  between   the   ground\r\n\r\nsquatters  and  the  new settlers  and  has  thus\r\n\r\nslowed down the resettlement scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, the Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  very shorthanded. Unless  it  can\r\n\r\nrecruit enough personnel, it would not be able to\r\n\r\ncope  with  our  rapid development.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will take note of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Jalan Kayu said that\r\n\r\nthe   Government  should  pay  attention  to  the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  and welfare of resettled  people.\r\n\r\nAt  the very least, they should be provided  with\r\n\r\nsuch  social amenities and services as they  used\r\n\r\nto  get before they were resettled. I fully agree\r\n\r\nwith what the Member said. However, what puts  me\r\n\r\nin  a  daze most is that whenever the authorities\r\n\r\nintend to carry out certain resettlement schemes,\r\n\r\nno  provision is given to the building of schools\r\n\r\nas  part of the resettlement blue-print. Thus the\r\n\r\nfarmers who are affected by resettlement are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworried by the prospect that their children  would\r\n\r\nnot  be able to get places in the schools. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  no need for  me  to  stress  the\r\n\r\nimportance of education here. To the poor  farmers\r\n\r\nin  particular, it is very important  that  their\r\n\r\nchildren  should get a good education. This  is  a\r\n\r\nmeans  to improve their economic position  whereby\r\n\r\nthey can bridge the gap between the haves and  the\r\n\r\nhave-nots.  It  is  regrettable  to  say  that  no\r\n\r\nprovision  or  consideration  is  given   by   the\r\n\r\nauthorities concerned for the building of  schools\r\n\r\nin   resettlement  areas.  For  example,   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency, Loke Yang School was asked  to  make\r\n\r\nway  for  development. After so many appeals,  the\r\n\r\nschool   could   only   get   about   $30,000   as\r\n\r\ncompensation and a piece of land in  the  Lim  Chu\r\n\r\nKang  resettlement area from the authorities. That\r\n\r\nis  the  end  of it. The farmers are  expected  to\r\n\r\nbuild  the  school  by themselves.  Although  many\r\n\r\nfarmers  are very keen on donating to the building\r\n\r\nof  a  school, however, as settlers, they are  not\r\n\r\neconomically  strong enough, though  their  hearts\r\n\r\nare  willing.  Even  with the donations  they  get\r\n\r\nadded to the compensation given by the Government,\r\n\r\nthey  still would not be able to build a standard-type  school.  If a substandard school  is  built,\r\n\r\nwith  lack  of equipment and facilities,  how  are\r\n\r\nthey  going to raise the standard of education  of\r\n\r\nthe  pupils?  In  the addendum to the  President's\r\n\r\nspeech,  mention  is made of the  raising  of  the\r\n\r\nquality  of education. How are we going to achieve\r\n\r\nthis?  I hope the Minister will remember that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   labels  itself   as   a   socialistic\r\n\r\ngovernment.  When the farmers have been  resettled\r\n\r\nelsewhere, the educational needs of their children\r\n\r\nshould  be well looked after. I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  personally take the initiative to see to  it\r\n\r\nthat in the resettlement areas, enough schools are\r\n\r\nbuilt,  for which he will be amply thanked by  the\r\n\r\nresettled people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about building schools, let me deal\r\n\r\nwith  certain  questions of  education.  From  the\r\n\r\npolicy  speech, we  know that  there  will  be  a\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility in the field of education  so\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  child will be given an opportunity to learn\r\n\r\ntwo  languages.  Thus, in the  coming  years,  our\r\n\r\npublicised multilingual system with four  official\r\n\r\nlanguages  will be given a true meaning  and  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  bright  future. Sir,  in  the  past,  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  bilingualism  centred  on  the   time\r\n\r\navailable  for  the  teaching  of  the  languages.\r\n\r\nHowever, the number of subjects remains the  same.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  are now stressing the importance  of\r\n\r\nlearning   a  second  language,  the  total   time\r\n\r\navailable for teaching is the same. We have  rigid\r\n\r\nlesson plans which cannot be changed. We know that\r\n\r\ncertain  subjects, whether  in  primary  schools,\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools or pre-university classes,  are\r\n\r\nrepetitious  in  nature.  No  doubt  the   subject\r\n\r\ncontents  have been progressively graded. However,\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is not necessary to go  deeper  into\r\n\r\nthese  subjects repetitiously, and we  should  not\r\n\r\nspend so much time on the same subjects. I hope in\r\n\r\nthe  new  curricula for the primary  schools,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will give recognition to this. We realise\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  educational  experts  engaged   in\r\n\r\nresearch  into the new curricula, and the  success\r\n\r\nor  failure  of [his reform will affect  both  our\r\n\r\npresent  and  future generations and our  national\r\n\r\nfuture.  So  1  hope  the Government  will  invite\r\n\r\neducationists from the various educational  bodies\r\n\r\nin  the communities to participate In more of such\r\n\r\nresearch  and  to give their views. I  agree  that\r\n\r\nmore  time  should  be spent on  the  teaching  of\r\n\r\nsecond languages in the primary schools. Bilingual\r\n\r\neducation should commence when children are in the\r\n\r\nprimary  schools. No doubt, this will  be  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  certain  other  subjects.  But  these\r\n\r\nsubjects  could be taught later on to  allow  more\r\n\r\ntime  for teaching second languages. However,  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum should be properly planned and balanced\r\n\r\nby our experts. Otherwise, our pupils will acquire\r\n\r\nonly a superficial knowledge of languages, lacking\r\n\r\nin  certain important information. This  will  not\r\n\r\nhelp  meet our social requirements. More  flexible\r\n\r\nsubjects  such  as  physical education,  the  fine\r\n\r\narts, handicraft and music might he taught in  the\r\n\r\nsecond language to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide  more  scope  for our pupils  to  practise\r\n\r\ntheir second languages. This will help raise their\r\n\r\nproficiency in the second language. However,  when\r\n\r\nimplementing   this  policy,   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation should not be too hasty. It must  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the status and position of teachers are  not\r\n\r\naffected  and  changed.  The  characteristics  and\r\n\r\ntraditions of the various language-stream  schools\r\n\r\nshould be preserved. It is important to have  more\r\n\r\nlanguage periods. On the other hand, we must  also\r\n\r\nensure  that essential information, necessary  for\r\n\r\nchildren growing up, is imparted to them. One good\r\n\r\nfeature  about Chinese education is that character\r\n\r\ntraining  and  ethics are taught  right  from  the\r\n\r\nbeginning in the primary schools. This feature  is\r\n\r\nworth preserving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, education is a long-term\r\n\r\nprocess. The effectiveness of our education policy\r\n\r\nwill  largely affect the future of our nation.  We\r\n\r\nshould  therefore be cautious in implementing  any\r\n\r\nnew  policy. We should not be too hasty if we want\r\n\r\nto get good results. Experiments and pilot schemes\r\n\r\nshould  be  carried out to test  whether  the  new\r\n\r\ntheory is workable before implementation. Thus  it\r\n\r\nwould involve many facets of education. Whether or\r\n\r\nnot our education policy will be successful mainly\r\n\r\ndepends   on  the  Teachers'  Training   College's\r\n\r\nefforts in producing efficient teachers. There  is\r\n\r\na  saying that if you want to do a thing well, you\r\n\r\nmust sharpen the tool first. The effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nthe T.T.C, will have very far-reaching effects  on\r\n\r\nwhether our education policy will he successful or\r\n\r\nnot.  I  believe that in our educational  reforms,\r\n\r\nthe  T.1'.C, should  play a  more  effective  and\r\n\r\nimportant role. In fact, it should become a centre\r\n\r\nfor theoretical studies and research. The findings\r\n\r\nof  the  centre could then be implemented  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education with full participation  by\r\n\r\nall  the  schools.  In this way,  the  effects  of\r\n\r\neducational reforms will be more beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the enrolment of Primary T pupils in\r\n\r\nthe last few days we can see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a  very good sign. This  shows  that\r\n\r\nparents   are   deeply   concerned   about   their\r\n\r\nchildren's future. They were pre, pared  to  queue\r\n\r\nup  day  and night am! even went without  food  in\r\n\r\norder  to  get  a  place for their children.  This\r\n\r\ndeserve  our commendation. On the other  hand, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  ask ourselves this question: why  should\r\n\r\nparents queue up to get places for their children?\r\n\r\nThis is not desirable. If foreign tourists were to\r\n\r\npass  by  these schools, they would be  under  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that there was an influx  of  refugees\r\n\r\nfrom other countries. What is more serious is that\r\n\r\ncertain  unscrupulous  characters  exploited   the\r\n\r\nsituation  by occupying some places in  the  queue\r\n\r\nand  selling them at exorbitant prices to  waiting\r\n\r\nparents.  I feel the Ministry of Education  should\r\n\r\nnot  shirk its responsibility any more. It  should\r\n\r\nmake  an overall review of the registration system\r\n\r\nfor Primary I classes to stop similar occurrences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I associate myself with the Member for Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan in thanking the President for his speech to\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> I rise to speak\r\n\r\nin   support  of  the  motion  of  thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident's speech to this Parliament.  The  first\r\n\r\npoint which I wish to comment upon represents  one\r\n\r\naspect  of  the rapid rate of development  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  industry in Singapore. We are all  proud\r\n\r\nof  the  fact that the success of the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  can be  clearly  seen  in  the\r\n\r\ntowering  blocks of flats which,  in  some  cases,\r\n\r\nstand  on  formerly  swampy ground  or  wasteland.\r\n\r\nStatistical  evidence of such  success  is  to  be\r\n\r\nfound in the fact that approximately one-third  of\r\n\r\nthe population of Singapore is accommodated in the\r\n\r\nvarious  housing units put up by the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board.  It  is  also  a   matter   of\r\n\r\ncongratulation  that,  with  the  policy  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government to allow C.P.F, contributions\r\n\r\nto  be  used  for  the purchase of  Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats, a substantial portion of residents in  such\r\n\r\nflats  are  owner-occupier.  The  desirability  of\r\n\r\nresiding in or owning a Housing Board flat is one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthing,  but the ability to do so is another thing.\r\n\r\nSuch  is  the demand for Housing Board flats  that\r\n\r\nthe  procedure  governing the allocation  of  such\r\n\r\nfiats  has to be strictly adhered to, in order  to\r\n\r\nensure fair play for everyone concerned, not least\r\n\r\nthe applicants themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that only persons who\r\n\r\nare  victims  of  a  fire  or  any  other  natural\r\n\r\ncatastrophe, or persons who are affected by  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal   schemes   involving  the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board or the Government, may be  given\r\n\r\npriority in the allocation of these flats. In  all\r\n\r\nother  cases,  the applicants have to  take  their\r\n\r\nturn in accordance with the order of registration.\r\n\r\nThere  is, however, a substantial group of persons\r\n\r\nwho  are not fortunate enough to be classified  as\r\n\r\nfire   victims,  or  persons  displaced   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's urban renewal scheme, but who are  in\r\n\r\nthe same and equally desperate position in respect\r\n\r\nof  housing as that of other persons. I  refer  to\r\n\r\nthose  persons  who  have been  staying,  in  some\r\n\r\ncases, for two or three decades in areas which are\r\n\r\nnow   acquired  by  private  developers  with  the\r\n\r\nintention of putting up blocks of luxury flats  or\r\n\r\nshopping  complexes. It is true that some  private\r\n\r\ndevelopers pay out fairly liberal sums of monetary\r\n\r\ncompensation to those persons who have been served\r\n\r\nwith  quit notices. There are developers  who  pay\r\n\r\nonly   a  token  sum  in  order  to  obtain  early\r\n\r\npossession of the site. I have been approached  by\r\n\r\na number of such persons who seek my assistance in\r\n\r\nobtaining Housing Board flats. It appears that  by\r\n\r\nfar the greater majority of such persons prefer to\r\n\r\nutilise  the  monetary  compensation  to  purchase\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats. Such persons are confused and\r\n\r\npuzzled  by  the  predicament in which  they  have\r\n\r\nfound  themselves through no initiative  of  their\r\n\r\nown.  The  alternative  housing  which  they   can\r\n\r\nafford,  and  for which there is  a  long  waiting\r\n\r\nqueue, seems to be the monopoly of the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board. On the other hand, their  homes\r\n\r\nhave been demolished by the private developers  to\r\n\r\nmake  way  for luxury blocks of flats or  shopping\r\n\r\ncomplexes which are beyond\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir means, even with the monetary compensation\r\n\r\nprovided by the private developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the authorities to do something for these\r\n\r\nunfortunate people. Granted that a certain  amount\r\n\r\nof  suffering and inconvenience cannot be  avoided\r\n\r\nin  the process of economic development, but it is\r\n\r\nalso  equally  true that it is the policy  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   minimise  such   suffering   and\r\n\r\ninconvenience  as far as is practicable.  This  is\r\n\r\nevidenced by the recent decision of the Government\r\n\r\nto  increase  the  rate  of compensation  paid  to\r\n\r\npersons  affected by resettlement. In the  present\r\n\r\ncase,  perhaps  some  arrangements  can  be   made\r\n\r\nbetween  the Government and private developers  to\r\n\r\nprovide  persons rendered homeless as a result  of\r\n\r\nprivate   development  with  alternative  housing,\r\n\r\nwhether  put  up  by the Housing  and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard or otherwise, which is within their means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of labour, I\r\n\r\nwish  to support the sentiments expressed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Bukit Ho Swee. An early review of  the\r\n\r\nwage   restraint  imposed  on  labour  should   be\r\n\r\nconsidered.  It  is heartening to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is conscious of the fact  that  labour\r\n\r\nhas,  in  no small way, contributed to  the  rapid\r\n\r\neconomic growth of Singapore. Unfortunately, there\r\n\r\nare  still  some  employers who prefer,  for  some\r\n\r\nreason  or  other, to ignore this. The payment  of\r\n\r\nadditional  bonus is one example.  Although  there\r\n\r\nare  indications  that they have made  substantial\r\n\r\nprofits,  these  employers  are  not  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider any additional payment of bonus to  their\r\n\r\nemployees.  The  quantum of  bonus  negotiable  is\r\n\r\nrestricted  to one month's salary. Any payment  in\r\n\r\nexcess   of  this  amount  is  governed   by   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Employment Act. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nunions  are not in a position to make any  further\r\n\r\nclaims on the employers even though they are quite\r\n\r\ncertain  that such employers have made substantial\r\n\r\nprofits.  In  this  respect,  I  would  urge   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to consider providing some avenues  for\r\n\r\nthe   unions   to   bring  up   such   cases   for\r\n\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the accelerated rate of\r\n\r\nwithdrawal by the British Armed Forces,  thousands\r\n\r\nof  our  citizens will be left without jobs.  From\r\n\r\nexperience, we find that not all of these  workers\r\n\r\ncan  be re-trained for alternative technical jobs.\r\n\r\nBecause of age and educational qualifications,  it\r\n\r\nis  also  difficult for them to  find  alternative\r\n\r\nemployment in the private sector. I would ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to consider whether these workers  can\r\n\r\nbe  absorbed  in Government departments,  the  Car\r\n\r\nPark  Division, the Postal or Hawkers' Department,\r\n\r\nor   as  lift  attendants  in  public  or  private\r\n\r\nbuildings. It is a common sight to see many of our\r\n\r\nable-bodied young men and women working in the Car\r\n\r\nParks Division and as lift attendants in public or\r\n\r\nprivate  buildings.  Surely these  youths  can  be\r\n\r\ndiscouraged from taking up such employment and  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to work in the industries where  their\r\n\r\nyouth and energy can be better utilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's speech, it is mentioned that there are\r\n\r\nplans  to restructure the existing w e if  a  r  e\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and  that  new  facilities  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided. Here, I would like to seek f u r t h e r\r\n\r\nclarification f r o m the Government whether  such\r\n\r\nplans  include the extension of these  facilities,\r\n\r\nsuch as homes for the aged and infirm, to our non-destitute  senior citizens. There are in Singapore\r\n\r\na  number of such senior citizens who could not be\r\n\r\nadmitted to the existing institutions because they\r\n\r\ndo  not  meet the qualifications imposed by  these\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  Due  to family  considerations  and\r\n\r\nother  problems,  many of these people  cannot  be\r\n\r\ntaken  care  of  by their children  or  relatives.\r\n\r\nMembers of their families are prepared to pay  for\r\n\r\nthe  services provided if such facilities are made\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Government will look\r\n\r\ninto the problems raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the second session of  the  Second\r\n\r\nParliament was solemnly opened by the President of\r\n\r\nSingapore on the 21st of last month.
