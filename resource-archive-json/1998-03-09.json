The SRP is targetted  at\r\n\r\nless educated workers in their 30s and 40s, who may face greater\r\n\r\ndifficulty seeking re-employment.  Government's support is up to\r\n\r\n80%  of course fees to be paid by the Productivity and Standards\r\n\r\nBoard (PSB) from the Skills Development Fund (SDF) and up to 70%\r\n\r\nof  absentee payroll subject to a maximum of $4.20 per  trainee-hour, paid by EDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been informed that to date, 1,230 workers have\r\n\r\ngone  through or are undergoing certifiable training  under  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme.  Of these workers, more than 50%\r\n\r\nare  above  the  age  of  40 and approximately  70%  have  below\r\n\r\nSecondary 2 education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance is also granted to the retrenched workers under\r\n\r\nthe  tripartite \"Back to Work\" Programme launched  in  September\r\n\r\n1996 by my Ministry together with the Productivity and Standards\r\n\r\nBoard,  the  National Trades Union Congress  and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational Employers Federation. The assistance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincludes  helping the retrenched workers find suitable jobs  and\r\n\r\nencouraging  employers to employ retrenched  workers  through  a\r\n\r\ntraining grant which enables the workers to undergo Core  Skills\r\n\r\nand Job Skills Training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core Skills Training includes confidence building, personal\r\n\r\neffectiveness and basic computer literacy. The training is fully\r\n\r\nsupported  by the SDF which provides a flat grant  of  $350  per\r\n\r\ntrainee  including an allowance of $100 to each trainee to  help\r\n\r\ndefray his meals and transport expenses. Job Skills Training  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose  of  helping the workers to  acquire  specific\r\n\r\nskills  required  for  the  jobs. For such  training,  SDF  will\r\n\r\nprovide  enhanced  funding up to 80%  of  the  course  fees  for\r\n\r\nexternal  training programme or $4 per trainee hour for  on-the-job training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in anticipation of more retrenchments in the coming\r\n\r\nmonths as a result of the regional financial crisis and slowdown\r\n\r\nin  the  economy, my Ministry has recently set up  a  Tripartite\r\n\r\nPanel on Retrenched Workers comprising representatives from  the\r\n\r\nEDB, NTUC, SNEF, PSB and my Ministry itself to assist retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  seek  re-employment.  The  Panel  will  also  encourage\r\n\r\nemployers to take advantage of available training incentives  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  skills of their workers during  the  lull  period.\r\n\r\nWorkers, on the other hand, are urged to take training and skill\r\n\r\nupgrading   seriously  so  that  they  can   remain   employable\r\n\r\nespecially during an economic slowdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

In fact,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nmention  that  in this report of 6th March, it was  stated  that\r\n\r\nthey have signed up quite a large number of employers under  the\r\n\r\nnew  phase to launch further Skills Redevelopment Programme  for\r\n\r\ntheir  workers  and  currently, a  total  of  76  companies  are\r\n\r\nparticipating and 5,000 workers are involved in the scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEASURES TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST MASSIVE BLACKOUT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr S Iswaran</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry\r\n\r\nwhat  measures already exist, and what additional  measures  are\r\n\r\nneeded,  to  safeguard  against  the  occurrence  of  a  massive\r\n\r\nblackout  like  that  which  recently  affected  Auckland,   New\r\n\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> The cause of the recent cable failures in\r\n\r\nAuckland,  New Zealand, has yet to be established. According  to\r\n\r\nsome  reports, they were probably caused by the abnormal  drying\r\n\r\nup  of the soil surrounding the cables due to the prolonged  hot\r\n\r\nand  dry summer. Consequently, heat could not be conducted  away\r\n\r\nfrom   the   heavily  loaded  cables  fast  enough.  The   cable\r\n\r\ntemperature   could   have   risen   well   above   its   design\r\n\r\nspecifications, leading to the cascading cable failures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such form of cable failure is unlikely in Singapore as\r\n\r\nPowerGrid  Ltd, the electricity network operator  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nhas instituted the following measures:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Firstly, PowerGrid has built a strong transmission\r\n\r\nnetwork.  For example, the CBD network is supplied  by  multiple\r\n\r\n230 kV sources and is interconnected to provide contingencies to\r\n\r\ntake care of unforeseen cable failures or damages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Secondly, PowerGrid's 230 kV transmission cables are\r\n\r\ninstalled  with  backfill  designed  to  ensure  efficient  heat\r\n\r\ndissipation and avoid thermal overloading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Thirdly, with advances in technology, Distributed\r\n\r\nTemperature Sensing (DTS) cables are now available which  enable\r\n\r\nreal-time monitoring of the actual cable temperature.  PowerGrid\r\n\r\nhas  installed  such DTS cable on a 400 kV  cable  and  will  be\r\n\r\ninstalling it on two additional 400 kV cables and future 230  kV\r\n\r\ncables.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PowerGrid has a rolling 10-year development plan to expand\r\n\r\nand renew the network to meet Singapore's electricity demand  in\r\n\r\na reliable, secure and timely manner.  For example, PowerGrid is\r\n\r\ncurrently  developing  a  new 230 kV substation  at  Peng  Nguan\r\n\r\nStreet  to  reinforce the network in anticipation of  the  CBD's\r\n\r\nrising demand in the years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ELECTRONIC ROAD PRICING</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Deferment of implementation)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nwhether he will defer the implementation of the Electronic  Road\r\n\r\nPricing (ERP) system after 1st\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 1998, in view of the current difficult economic conditions\r\n\r\nwhich will impact local businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  road pricing is a major pillar in our  long-term\r\n\r\nstrategy  to  keep our roads  free-flowing. Our  roads  are  our\r\n\r\neconomic arteries. If they get clogged, transport costs will  go\r\n\r\nup, businesses will lose time and money, and the productivity of\r\n\r\nour workers will suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road pricing has been implemented in Singapore since 1975\r\n\r\nwith  the  Area  Licensing Scheme, and recently  with  the  Road\r\n\r\nPricing  Scheme on our expressways.  It has been  successful  in\r\n\r\nmanaging  the traffic on our roads.  But more needs to  be  done\r\n\r\nbecause  on one hand our vehicle population is growing,  yet  on\r\n\r\nthe other hand our land area remains constant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) will replace both the ALS\r\n\r\nand the RPS schemes.  It is more flexible, more efficient and in\r\n\r\nthe long run, more cost effective. It marks a shift in emphasis,\r\n\r\nfrom  charging for vehicle ownership to charging for usage.   It\r\n\r\nwill   encourage  more  judicious  usage  and  keep  our   roads\r\n\r\ncongestion free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason to delay the start of ERP on 1st April\r\n\r\nbecause  of the current economic situation. In fact, the current\r\n\r\nslow-down should spur us to implement policies to strengthen our\r\n\r\nadvantages, like our transport system, in order to maintain  our\r\n\r\neconomic  competitiveness.  The ERP  and  the  new  vehicle  tax\r\n\r\nstructure revealed on 4th March serve this objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tax structure and the package of ERP rebates\r\n\r\nbenefit  most motorists in general and businesses in particular.\r\n\r\nFor example, Additional Registration Fee (ARF) for tourist buses\r\n\r\nwill  be  reduced from 55% of Open Market Value (OMV) to  5%  of\r\n\r\nOMV, Registration Fee (RF) for goods vehicles will be reduced by\r\n\r\nas  much as $13,000, and ARF for engineering plant vehicles will\r\n\r\nbe waived.  The annual road tax of most commercial vehicles will\r\n\r\nalso  be  reduced  substantially, by as much as  $2,000.   Where\r\n\r\ntaxes have been increased, we will phase in the increase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover  three years.  To help businesses adjust to the ERP system,\r\n\r\nwe  will  phase-in  the ERP charges for all commercial  vehicles\r\n\r\nover  the  next  three to four years.  In effect,  many  vehicle\r\n\r\nowners  will pay lower road pricing charges than what  they  pay\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial vehicle owners and fleet operators will benefit\r\n\r\neven  more if they exercise their ingenuity and discretion. They\r\n\r\ncan   reduce  their  ERP  bill  by  planning  their  routes  and\r\n\r\nscheduling their delivery times carefully, and pooling transport\r\n\r\nresources where possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether his Ministry has done any studies or comparison\r\n\r\nfor  companies  that  are involved in the transport  trade,  ie,\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  are  going  to  use  a  lot  of  vehicles   for\r\n\r\ntransportation?   What would be the impact of  the  ERP  on  the\r\n\r\ntotal  expenses before and after the implementation of  the  ERP\r\n\r\nprogramme?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for companies that are\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  transport and logistics like  freight  forwarding,\r\n\r\nthere  will be a substantial reduction in their upfront cost  as\r\n\r\nwell  as in their road tax.  But on the other hand, the ERP will\r\n\r\nadd  cost to the usage of the roads.  How much additional  costs\r\n\r\nthey  will incur as a result of ERP is difficult for us  to  say\r\n\r\nbecause  it  depends very much on their usage.  But  ultimately,\r\n\r\nERP  is a tool for us to help businesses to readjust the way  of\r\n\r\ndoing  business  and  to encourage them to use  the  roads  more\r\n\r\njudiciously,  as  I said.  In the long run, if they  succeed  in\r\n\r\ndoing  so,  it  will even be more beneficial to  them.   Indeed,\r\n\r\ncompanies  like  the bus companies and the taxi  companies  have\r\n\r\nalready  started to make use of technology, to make use  of  new\r\n\r\nways  of operating their business in order to adjust to the ERP.\r\n\r\nIn  so  doing, they will reap not only the full benefits of  the\r\n\r\nupfront  tax reductions but they will also help to reduce  their\r\n\r\nERP bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> May I also ask the Minister that since\r\n\r\nthe ERP programme is going to be revenue neutral over the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlonger  term,  in effect, would it not actually be loading  more\r\n\r\nonto  companies that have to be involved in the transport  trade\r\n\r\ncompared to what they are now, because they are even now  loaded\r\n\r\nagainst in terms of usage?  But after the implementation of  the\r\n\r\nERP, the loading could even be heavier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, as I said, if everything\r\n\r\nremains  the same, if transport companies continue to run  their\r\n\r\nbusiness in the same way without making any adjustment, then the\r\n\r\nanswer is yes, there would be additional cost to them.  But this\r\n\r\nis  precisely  the reason why we are implementing a  new  system\r\n\r\nwhich  is charging for usage rather than charging for ownership.\r\n\r\nBecause there is now a rebalancing of the structure and there is\r\n\r\nnow  a shift of charges from ownership to usage, there will  be,\r\n\r\nat  the very beginning, upfront savings for these companies that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  talks  about.  It is now a question  of  how  those\r\n\r\ncompanies adjust their business in order to try and keep as much\r\n\r\nas possible of those savings that have been given to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Will the Minister agree that motorcycles\r\n\r\nare used by the working class and people with low incomes to get\r\n\r\nto  work?

Indeed  as a result of the massive tax rebates\r\n\r\nthat  have  been  given  to businesses, particularly  businesses\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  transportation,  freight  forwarding  and  so  on,\r\n\r\nhopefully  there will be some passing back of those  savings  to\r\n\r\nthe consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, since the Minister\r\n\r\nintends to implement the system anyway, can I can ask why do  we\r\n\r\nnot bring the implementation date forward to the 1st April?  The\r\n\r\nscheme  has already started to create a lot of confusion to  the\r\n\r\nmotor  traders.   Since we plan to implement it, why do  we  not\r\n\r\nimplement it on 1st April?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> May I ask the Member what confusion he is\r\n\r\ntalking about?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Especially in the area of commercial\r\n\r\nvehicles,  with the registration fee coming down  by  a  drastic\r\n\r\namount,  a lot of companies that have placed orders for vehicles\r\n\r\nare  waiting  or  cancelling their orders.   This  has  actually\r\n\r\ncreated  problems for motor traders, and there is a wait-and-see\r\n\r\nattitude.  In my opinion, since we have decided to implement the\r\n\r\nscheme, we  could  bring forward the implementation date.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the package of tax reductions and the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  ERP  was done as a total  package.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  implementation  of ERP  is  actually  going  to  be\r\n\r\neffective  in a very small way on 1st April, a very  small  way,\r\n\r\nbut in a more widespread way from 1st September.  Therefore, the\r\n\r\nLTA  formulated  this package of measures to also  be  effective\r\n\r\nfrom 1st September.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards motorists holding back their purchases, as far\r\n\r\nas  those  who already have COEs in hand are concerned,  what  I\r\n\r\nwould term old COEs, there is really no reason for them to  hold\r\n\r\nback  their  purchases because those with old COEs will  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  register their vehicles under the new  tax  regime.\r\n\r\nThat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  be unfair to those who have already registered using  the\r\n\r\nold  COEs.   Old  COEs already available   have to  be  used  to\r\n\r\nregister  vehicles using the old tax regime.  So there is  still\r\n\r\nbusiness to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards people holding back purchases of new vehicles,\r\n\r\nthe  Motor  Traders  Association and  other  parties  have  made\r\n\r\nrepresentations  to  the LTA.  The LTA  is  now  studying  these\r\n\r\nrepresentations  and  it  will  consider  these  views  and   an\r\n\r\nannouncement will be made one way or another very soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Minister aware\r\n\r\nthat  motorcyclists will eventually pay higher charges for  road\r\n\r\nusage?  The fact is that they will have to pay much higher  road\r\n\r\ntax after the phasing in of road tax after five years.   In view\r\n\r\nof  the motorcyclists' income, is the Minister of the view  that\r\n\r\nthe system is equitable to them?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The Ministry has looked at the position of\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists very carefully because we realise very  well  that\r\n\r\npeople  who own motorcycles are people who generally  belong  to\r\n\r\nthe lower income group and who need to use their motorcycles for\r\n\r\nbusiness.  The fact is that more than 80% of motorcyclists today\r\n\r\ndo not pass through any ALS or RPS point.  This finding is based\r\n\r\non  surveys  as well as on the sale of ALS and RPS coupons.   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  86% of motorcyclists do not pass through  any  of\r\n\r\nthese points.   What that means is that any rebates and any  tax\r\n\r\nsavings  that  will arise as a result of this  package  will  be\r\n\r\nbeneficial  to  them.   It  will go straight  to  their  pockets\r\n\r\nbecause they do not have to pay anything upfront.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another 10% of motorcyclists pass through the ALS\r\n\r\nor  RPS  points once.  So, if we implement ERP and if the  rates\r\n\r\nare  more or less the same as what they are today, again,  there\r\n\r\nis  really no difference from what the situation is today.   And\r\n\r\nany  rebates  that  they  get will also  go  straight  to  their\r\n\r\npockets.  So it is the very small group of people, about  5%  or\r\n\r\nso,  who use the RPS and ALS very often, yes, they will have  to\r\n\r\nincur  higher cost.  But as I said, this is the purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nroad pricing scheme.  This is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurpose  of electronic road pricing which encourages  people  to\r\n\r\nsave  and  penalises people who use our roads  during  congested\r\n\r\nhours more heavily.  It is precisely for that reason that we are\r\n\r\nimplementing ERP.  It is not to make the scheme revenue  neutral\r\n\r\nfor  each and every motorist or motorcyclist.  Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nincumbent on companies and motorcyclists to now  relook  at  the\r\n\r\nway  they  are doing business.  That is the whole  idea  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme.   It is not meant to be a painless scheme for everybody.\r\n\r\nIf that were the case, we might as well not have implemented it,\r\n\r\nbecause  this scheme is meant for people to change their driving\r\n\r\nhabits.   But  in the formulation of the scheme, we  have  taken\r\n\r\npains to make sure that the pain for motorcyclists is minimised,\r\n\r\nand we have done so in several ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have looked at the PCU ratings. We have looked at how\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists  should be taxed in relation  to  cars.   We  have\r\n\r\ntaken  the smallest number to compute their road tax.   We  have\r\n\r\nlooked  at small motorcycles as opposed to big motorcycles.   We\r\n\r\nhave looked at the motorcyclist who owns a 200 cc motorcycle and\r\n\r\nbelow  and taxed him differently from somebody, say, who owns  a\r\n\r\nHarley  Davidson, and we phase in the increases,  if  any,  over\r\n\r\nthree  years.  All this, taken together with the road tax rebate\r\n\r\nand  phase-in,  means  that  effectively  99%  of  motorcyclists\r\n\r\nactually do not pay any more taxes.  In fact, if you look at the\r\n\r\ncalculations  which we have done, motorcyclists owning  vehicles\r\n\r\nbelow  350 cc actually will pay zero road tax over the  new  few\r\n\r\nyears.  Five years later, they would have adjusted.  But,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid, this scheme is not meant to be a standstill for motorcycle\r\n\r\ntaxes.  That I must admit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, if I may revert to the Minister's reply\r\n\r\nto  my  question on delaying the implementation of the  ERP  for\r\n\r\nmotorcycles, would he agree that his answer is really no answer?\r\n\r\nBecause  in  the  case  of road tax, they  might  probably  have\r\n\r\nalready  paid or it may not be due for some time.

There  is  a\r\n\r\nwhole  range of vehicles registered on our roads today,  680,000\r\n\r\nof  them, ranging from very small 100 cc bikes, all the  way  to\r\n\r\nvery heavy goods vehicles, the semi-trailers and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are starting off, as I said, with a blank sheet of\r\n\r\npaper.  We are looking at the right tax that each vehicle should\r\n\r\npay based on (1) traffic considerations; and (2) based on what I\r\n\r\nwould call social equity considerations, meaning if you drive  a\r\n\r\nbigger  car, you should actually be paying a higher tax  than  a\r\n\r\nsmaller  car.   If you ride a bigger motorcycle, you  should  be\r\n\r\npaying  more than a smaller motorcycle.  We put all these things\r\n\r\ntogether  and  we  came up with a basis for  charging  different\r\n\r\nvehicles.   In the process, we realised that for some  vehicles,\r\n\r\nthey  should be paying lower tax, eg, goods vehicles.  For other\r\n\r\nvehicles, they should be paying higher tax.  For example, motor-cycles.   Motorcycles'  tax has not been  changed  for  decades.\r\n\r\nSome  of  them  pay $20 a year in tax, which also has  not  been\r\n\r\nchanged for decades.  But that is where we are today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we go from where we are today to what each vehicle\r\n\r\nshould  rightly  pay based on traffic and social considerations?\r\n\r\nFor  all  those who are going to pay less, there is no  problem.\r\n\r\nIt is a question of charging the new rate for them and they will\r\n\r\nenjoy the savings.  Good luck to them.  But those who are paying\r\n\r\nmore,  we  have taken the decision that we will phase  in  these\r\n\r\nincreases  where  there  is an increase, and  the  motorcyclists\r\n\r\nbelong  to this category that they will have to pay higher  road\r\n\r\ntax.   That is a fact based on their contribution to road  usage\r\n\r\nand other considerations like social equity and so on. So a 1600\r\n\r\ncc bike or a 1200 cc bike will pay $620 a year instead of $300 a\r\n\r\nyear for those big luxury bikes.  A 400 cc bike will pay $180  a\r\n\r\nyear  instead of $80 a year, an increase of $100 a  year.    The\r\n\r\nsmallest bike, say, the Honda 125 cc , instead of paying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$30  a year, will have to pay $100 eventually.  So motorcyclists\r\n\r\nshould  be paying $100, $180 and $620 relative to other vehicles\r\n\r\non the road.  That is how we derive the new tax structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise the pain and to phase in the increases, we have\r\n\r\ndone it over three years.  On top of that, we are giving the ERP\r\n\r\nrebates.  You put all these things together, as I said, the  net\r\n\r\nresult is that motorcyclists and many other vehicle owners  will\r\n\r\nover  the next couple of years actually be paying less road  tax\r\n\r\nthan  what they are paying today. Of course, yes, this  will  be\r\n\r\nphased in.  Motorcyclists will have to adjust to these increases\r\n\r\nover  three years in paying the new taxes.  But that is because,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, under the new tax regime, this is what they  should\r\n\r\nrightly be paying.  We have not adjusted the tax rates for many,\r\n\r\nmany  years.  This is the overall review that we are undertaking\r\n\r\nand  this  is  the  net  result of that  review.   But  we  have\r\n\r\nrecognised  that  motorcyclists  belong  to  several   different\r\n\r\ncategories.  The bulk of the motorcyclists in Singapore are  200\r\n\r\ncc  and  below.  For them, we are actually charging them  a  tax\r\n\r\nwhich  is less than what they should actually be paying.  So  we\r\n\r\nhave  also shifted that downwards.  For 1000 cc bikes and above,\r\n\r\nwe have made no adjustments.  No special consideration for them.\r\n\r\nThey  are  paying the correct taxes for motorcycles relative  to\r\n\r\ncars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with these adjustments, with the phasing in, and with an\r\n\r\nappropriate  choice  of the PCU unit, we believe  that  we  have\r\n\r\nadopted  a  fair, consistent and rational basis  for  taxes  for\r\n\r\nmotorcycles  as  well as for all other vehicles.   This  is  the\r\n\r\ntotal package that we are implementing together with the ERP.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  seek  a  clarification from the Minister  for  Communications\r\n\r\nregarding revenue neutrality for this exercise.  I read from the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance's Statement that overall  the  Government\r\n\r\nexpects to achieve revenue neutrality for this exercise in about\r\n\r\neight years.  Is this the target set and whether in fact the new\r\n\r\ncharges  levied  will  be  reviewed and increased  or  decreased\r\n\r\ndepending on the target set in terms of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neight  years?   Also  on  the question  of  revenue  neutrality,\r\n\r\nwhether in fact that should be a target by itself or whether  it\r\n\r\ncannot  be  based  on a formula of net gain for  road  users  if\r\n\r\ntraffic usage on the road is under better control.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> When we formulated the new tax structure,\r\n\r\nwe  had to have some idea of what revenue impact this would have\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are talking about changes in not only  annual  road\r\n\r\ntaxes  but also upfront taxes.  In establishing the new  regime,\r\n\r\nwe  took  into  account the basic principles, which  is  what  I\r\n\r\nexplained in Parliament earlier where we are shifting taxes from\r\n\r\nownership  to  usage,  where  we  are  taxing  cars,  buses  and\r\n\r\nmotorcycles  relative to road usage, where we are talking  about\r\n\r\ngiving concessions to public transport vehicles and so on and so\r\n\r\nforth.   But  the most important principle for us was  the  last\r\n\r\nprinciple of revenue neutrality.  Because without that principle\r\n\r\nwe  are  not able to arrive at numbers.  We can only talk  about\r\n\r\nprinciples, but we have to arrive at new numbers, new taxes, for\r\n\r\ndifferent classes of vehicles.  It is not a target.   It  is  an\r\n\r\nindication of what our intention is for this exercise, ie, it is\r\n\r\nnot  an  exercise  to raise revenue, but it is  an  exercise  in\r\n\r\nchanging  the  way we use and charge for the use  of  our  roads\r\n\r\nwith the intention that this new regime will keep our roads free-flowing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that basis, we have made the shift. We have reduced\r\n\r\nupfront taxes.  We have put it into ERP and usage charges.   But\r\n\r\nhow much to charge?  We have to get the calculations done.  That\r\n\r\ncalculation was done on that basis of revenue neutrality over  a\r\n\r\nperiod of five to eight years. Why five to eight years?   It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the current estimate is that with this new package,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  revenue  negative for the next five years,  which  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  has said, to the tune  of  slightly  over  $1\r\n\r\nbillion.  So $200 million negative every year, even taking  into\r\n\r\naccount the increased ERP revenues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it going to be neutral? It is going to be neutral\r\n\r\nif  we  can,  and  I  certainly hope we can,  issue  more  COEs.\r\n\r\nBecause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none of the benefits of this scheme is that we are able to, if we\r\n\r\ncan  spread  the load and get motorists to use the  roads  less,\r\n\r\nactually increase the allowable COEs over and above the 3%.   If\r\n\r\nthat  happens,  then the additional revenues and the  additional\r\n\r\ntaxes as a result of that will help to offset this package.  But\r\n\r\nit  is  not a target.  The ERP charges will be levied  based  on\r\n\r\ntraffic   conditions.   It  will  not  be   based   on   revenue\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, the LTA has declared that\r\n\r\none of the objectives of the ERP is really to free up the school\r\n\r\nbus market and that there will be more competition so that there\r\n\r\nwill  be no possibility of cartels fixing prices at unreasonably\r\n\r\nhigh levels.

One main reason is that because of the  region's\r\n\r\nfinancial turmoil and the resultant economic slowdown, there  is\r\n\r\nmuch  public  expectation of the Budget.  The second  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  while the region is indeed in turmoil, Singapore has  held\r\n\r\nup  quite well.  We are not in a recession.  At least, not  yet.\r\n\r\nHence,  the   Government cannot portray a picture  of  doom  and\r\n\r\ngloom,  and talk ourselves into a recession.  In fact, the  most\r\n\r\nstriking  feature of the Budget is what it is not!  Unlike  many\r\n\r\nother countries in the region, ours is not a crisis Budget.   It\r\n\r\ndoes not have the word \"crisis\" written all over it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of gathering views and reactions from the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community, our GPC for Finance and Trade and  Industry\r\n\r\nhad meetings with members of our Resource Panel, representatives\r\n\r\nof  the  International, Chinese, Malay and  Indian  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce,   and   trade  associations  such  as  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nConfederation of Industries, Singapore Association of Small  and\r\n\r\nMedium  Enterprises,  Singapore Hoteliers  Association  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Retailers  Association.   They  have  given  us  very\r\n\r\nvaluable feedback and I wish to thank them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the various groups have suggested that there\r\n\r\nshould have been pre-Budget consultations, in addition to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  post-Budget meetings.  This is a good suggestion.   I  feel\r\n\r\nthat the relevant Ministries should consider this idea of having\r\n\r\npre-Budget feedback meetings with selected industry groups.   On\r\n\r\nour  own,  our GPC has decided that we shall conduct  pre-Budget\r\n\r\nmeetings  for  next year's Budget and convey the views  received\r\n\r\nfrom the industry groups to the appropriate Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main message we received from our meetings with the\r\n\r\nvarious industry groups is that, while it is not unwise for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to be prudent and cautious, they would have liked  to\r\n\r\nsee  a more stimulative Budget.  They are disappointed that  the\r\n\r\nBudget  does not offer enough measures to help companies to  cut\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has predicted the 1998 GDP growth rate to be\r\n\r\nbetween  2.5%-4.5%.  However, many people in business felt  that\r\n\r\nthe  economic slowdown is already here, and many individuals and\r\n\r\ncompanies   are  facing  severe  financial  difficulties.    The\r\n\r\nreaction  is that the Government has chosen to adopt a wait  and\r\n\r\nsee  attitude.   The reality of the situation is that  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes  have arrived.  Many companies are facing the double  blow\r\n\r\nof shrinking business and credit squeeze.  The Government should\r\n\r\nnot  adopt a reactive stance, but rather a proactive one.   Most\r\n\r\nprefer the Government to take a bolder and anticipatory approach\r\n\r\nby  introducing  more serious measures now to  help  revive  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  I share their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To verify and substantiate their positions, the Singapore\r\n\r\nConfederation  of  Industries (SCI) and  the  Singapore  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) have conducted surveys\r\n\r\namong  their members.  The results they obtained was that  about\r\n\r\n60%  of SCI members and 54% of SCCCI members (in both cases more\r\n\r\nthan  50%)  felt  that their businesses would be badly  affected\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same reaction is more or less felt by the man-in-the-street. People are concerned that with the economic slowdown,\r\n\r\ntheir take-home pay will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmaller.   Some are fearful of the prospects of retrenchment  or\r\n\r\nprolonged  unemployment.  To make matters worse, some are  faced\r\n\r\nwith the problem of higher family expenses and other costs, such\r\n\r\nas  higher  interest  costs  for mortgage  loans.   When  people\r\n\r\ntighten  their belts, the contraction effect will ripple through\r\n\r\nthe economy.  The slowdown will be further aggravated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the business and ordinary people are saying is: why\r\n\r\nnot recognise the problem now and introduce stimulative measures\r\n\r\nimmediately.   The  comforting point is that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance has specifically said that he would introduce off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures, whenever necessary, to tackle problems that may  arise\r\n\r\nor when the economy worsens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to elaborate on some specific\r\n\r\nmeasures  which I feel the Government could have  considered  or\r\n\r\nintroduced  in this year's Budget or consider them as off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the individuals, the following measures could have been\r\n\r\nlooked into:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Higher income tax rebate</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people are puzzled why the Government has reduced the\r\n\r\nincome  tax rebate from 10% to only 5% this year.  The resultant\r\n\r\nhigher  tax  payable means that people will have less disposable\r\n\r\nincome.   They  will spend less, which in turn will  affect  the\r\n\r\nretail and other consumer trades.  Lower consumer spending means\r\n\r\nthat  the slowing economy will be further depressed.  The retail\r\n\r\nindustry has been facing poor business in the last three  years,\r\n\r\nand the outlook for them for the next one to two years would not\r\n\r\nbe better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, during the mid-80s recession, the Government\r\n\r\nactually gave a 25% rebate on income tax in the 1986 Budget.   I\r\n\r\npresume  the objective then was to offer various tax reliefs  to\r\n\r\nindividuals  and  companies to help stimulate the  economy.   We\r\n\r\nwonder why the Government took the reverse tack this time round.\r\n\r\nWhy not retain the 10% level of rebate?  Better still, if it can\r\n\r\nbe increased to 15%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Relief on mortgage interests</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent budget announced by Hong Kong's Finance\r\n\r\nSecretary,   a  new  tax  relief  of  HK$100,000  (approximately\r\n\r\nS$20,000) was introduced to help individuals get tax reliefs for\r\n\r\ntheir interest payments on mortgage loans.  This tax relief  was\r\n\r\nwelcomed  by  the  Hongkongers as it was targeted  to  help  the\r\n\r\n\"sandwiched\" or lower-middle income earners who are  faced  with\r\n\r\nhigh interest costs for housing loan mortgages.  As Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  also  facing the same problem of rising interest  rates  on\r\n\r\ntheir  housing loans, I would like to propose that  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  could  consider  a similar  tax  relief  for  interest\r\n\r\npayments  on mortgage loans.  This tax relief  will be of  great\r\n\r\nhelp to the younger families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents of HDB estates may have less need for this relief\r\n\r\nas  they get loans from the HDB at low preferential rates.   For\r\n\r\nyoung  families  that  recently  ventured  to  purchase  private\r\n\r\nproperties,  they will benefit from this tax relief.   Moreover,\r\n\r\nwhile  they  are paying substantial income taxes, they  are  not\r\n\r\nenjoying  the rental and S&C rebates given to HDB  dwellers.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge the Finance Minister to consider introducing\r\n\r\nthis tax relief as an off-Budget measure, when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the measures that can help the business sector, I\r\n\r\nhave the following suggestions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reduction in JTC/HDB rentals</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to freeze JTC/HDB rentals.\r\n\r\nWhile companies are relieved to hear this, they would have liked\r\n\r\nto  see  an actual reduction of, say, 10 to 15% in the  rentals.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it  could be argued that the impact of the  reductions\r\n\r\nwould be minimal on a company's overall costs, I would say  that\r\n\r\nany savings would be helpful during difficult times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reduction in CPF contributions</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1986 Budget, the Government made a 15% point cut in\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF contribution, by suspending the 4%  contribution\r\n\r\nto  the  Special Account and a massive 11% cut to  the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount.  For this year's Budget, I feel that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  have  considered  a  cut  in  the  employer's\r\n\r\ncontribution to the Special Account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that it will not be wise at this juncture to cut\r\n\r\nthe  employer's CPF contributions to the Ordinary  and  Medisave\r\n\r\nAccounts.  Otherwise, the reduction in the CPF contributions  to\r\n\r\nthese  Accounts will adversely impact the employees'  needs  for\r\n\r\nhousing and medical expenses.  However, a short-term cut of  the\r\n\r\n4%  contribution  to  the Special Account will  not  affect  the\r\n\r\nemployees'  CPF receipts which are meant to meet  their  housing\r\n\r\nand  medical  expenses.  The amount of savings to the  employers\r\n\r\nfrom this 4% cut to the Special Account will be substantial and,\r\n\r\nin fact, will offer them much relief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My GPC members will have other suggestions to add to those\r\n\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development of local talents</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to move on to another topic that I\r\n\r\nfeel  is also very important.  It is on the development of local\r\n\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced its intention to source for\r\n\r\nforeign talents to supplement the local pool.  Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  objective  as  commendable,  as  it  will  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  achieve a higher plane of growth.   Especially\r\n\r\nduring  this period of turmoil in the region, there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number  of capable and hardworking foreign professionals,\r\n\r\nR&D  personnel  and technicians who wish to seek  employment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We shall benefit from their contributions if we  can\r\n\r\nattract them to come and work here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singaporeans are concerned about the competition\r\n\r\nfrom  these foreign talents.  The answer, I feel, is that  while\r\n\r\nwe  wish  to  attract  foreign talents, we must  not  forget  to\r\n\r\ndevelop and maximise the potential of the locals.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nsupport  the  provisions  in the Budget  to  continue  to  spend\r\n\r\nsubstantial sums on education and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Naming of the bond-breakers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean is a rare resource. The Government has\r\n\r\nset up several scholarship schemes to send our best students\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverseas to study.  Upon their return, they can better serve the\r\n\r\ncountry.   While we frown upon scholars who broke  their  bonds,\r\n\r\nthe   statutory  boards,  such  as  the  EDB,  should  not  have\r\n\r\npublicised the names of these bond-breakers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students break their bonds for various personal reasons.\r\n\r\nMany  successful  local leaders, including MPs such  as  myself,\r\n\r\nhave  broken our scholarship bonds, but we continue to work  and\r\n\r\nserve  in Singapore.  I object to publicising the names  of  the\r\n\r\nbond-breakers because it is an insensitive move that could  lead\r\n\r\nto  the  alienation  of the entire body of scholarship  holders,\r\n\r\ntheir families and friends.  Worse, if these scholars chose  not\r\n\r\nto  return  to Singapore, there will be a greater  loss  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   In  addition, such a callous practice does  not  jell\r\n\r\nwith  the  image of an enlightened Government and  a  cultivated\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Moving ahead - Striving for a speedy recovery</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current meltdown of the regional economies offers many\r\n\r\nlessons.   As  stated by Mr Claude Smadja, managing director  of\r\n\r\nthe World Economic Forum, every government in this region has to\r\n\r\nlearn  how  to deal with a new animal in front of us,  which  is\r\n\r\n\"the  Global  Economy\".   He  said  that  because  of  the   new\r\n\r\ninformation   technology  age,  with   instantaneous   flow   of\r\n\r\ninformation  and funds world-wide, the New World  Order  demands\r\n\r\nconstant  up-to-date information with transparency of  rules  in\r\n\r\nthe  operating countries.  Singapore has stood up very  well  to\r\n\r\nthe  test of the turmoil as we have an efficient, effective  and\r\n\r\nhonest  Government with a high level of transparency  of  rules.\r\n\r\nThe  regional  turmoil  demonstrates that  countries  with  less\r\n\r\ntransparency of rules have suffered badly by the massive erosion\r\n\r\nof confidence and outflow of both foreign and local funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are threats, but the current regional turmoil also\r\n\r\noffers  many  opportunities.  It is  said  that  there  will  be\r\n\r\nabundant investment opportunities in the companies in the region\r\n\r\naround  us.   However,  we must remember that  major  MNCs  from\r\n\r\nEurope and America are also\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthinking of capitalising on the situation.  They have large cash\r\n\r\nhoards, and will be scouting around for good buys in the region.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  there will be other healthy and  strong  regional\r\n\r\ncompanies which will also be looking for good investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One disadvantage we are facing is that the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  and  the local firms are pulled down by the  famous  or\r\n\r\ninfamous  contagion  effect.   We have  to  rapidly  revive  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  economy  and  restore  confidence.   We  should   pick\r\n\r\nourselves  up  as  quickly  as  possible.   We  must  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to move ahead - while the companies in  the  region\r\n\r\nare  still trying to regain their balance but have not gained  a\r\n\r\nfoothold.   I  wish to quote a prominent local  businessman  who\r\n\r\nputs  it  graphically in Hokkien: \"Pak lang puat lok  long  kow,\r\n\r\ngoon  nang  em  tang  teh yi nang puat lok gi\".   It  means,  in\r\n\r\nEnglish,  \"Our neighbours have fallen into the drain, we  should\r\n\r\nnot be careless and jump into the drain ourselves\".  I feel that\r\n\r\ninstead  of trying to walk gingerly across a plank to cross  the\r\n\r\ndrain,  the  Government should help to put out  as  many  spring\r\n\r\nboards  as  possible, to enable Singaporeans and local companies\r\n\r\nto leap over the drain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be able to source for investment opportunities in the\r\n\r\nregion,  our companies must first be able to get their shops  at\r\n\r\nhome  in  order,  build  cash reserves, then  they  can  venture\r\n\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I conclude by congratulating the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister for preparing and presenting such  a  detailed\r\n\r\nand  comprehensive Budget.  Having heard the many feedback  from\r\n\r\nthe ground, I cannot help but to urge the Government that it  is\r\n\r\nnot  time to be faint-hearted, it is not time to hesitate.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  watch  the situation very  closely,  and  have\r\n\r\nregular  dialogues with industry groups and local organisations.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  need arises, off-Budget measures should be introduced\r\n\r\nbefore it is too late.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put on our spurs. The first runner off the mark\r\n\r\nwill win the race.  The early bird catches the worm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing\r\n\r\nme  to join in the debate on the Budget proposed by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, during the Budget debate, many Members made\r\n\r\na  call to the Minister to address issues related to the cost of\r\n\r\ndoing  business  in Singapore and in particular,  to  give  more\r\n\r\nconsideration to the manufacturing sector and to the  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprises.  At that time, when the interim Budget  was\r\n\r\nannounced,  the business community did express the  difficulties\r\n\r\nthey  were  facing, but we were all hoping that this year,  when\r\n\r\nthe  full  Budget was announced, all their concerns  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen adequately addressed by an all-rounded Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can understand the Government's long-term vision\r\n\r\nand  plan to make Singapore the financial and logistics  hub  in\r\n\r\nthis region, I feel the Minister missed out a few very important\r\n\r\nsectors  of  the  economy, especially the manufacturing  sector,\r\n\r\nsmall  and  medium  enterprises,  the  tourism  and  the  retail\r\n\r\nsectors.  The biggest disappointment, in my opinion, is that the\r\n\r\nMinister  did  not  do much for the manufacturing  sector  which\r\n\r\ncontributes about 25% to the Singapore GDP.  This and the  other\r\n\r\nsectors I have mentioned, have seen continual pressures for  the\r\n\r\nlast  two years and are expected to be badly hit this year  when\r\n\r\nthe full effect of the regional crisis is felt by our businesses\r\n\r\nand our companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in my opinion, the Budget is narrowly focused in the\r\n\r\nareas  that  the  Government wants to grow and  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nintention  is  not  to shrink the other important  sectors.   I,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  would  have  expected a telescopic  focus  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister,   looking  at  the  bigger  picture  rather   than   a\r\n\r\nmicroscopic  focus that ignores those sectors that fall  outside\r\n\r\nthe scope of focus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that there is a perception gap between what the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in Singapore are seeing and what the Government  has\r\n\r\nprojected  for the next one year.  In his speech,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nstated that the electronics sector in the west, particularly  in\r\n\r\nthe USA, is set for recovery and growth and therefore he expects\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  electronics-manufacturing sector in  Singapore  will  grow.\r\n\r\nHowever,  many  companies, including large  multinationals,  are\r\n\r\nseeing the exact opposite.  In fact, the semiconductor industry,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  one  of  the largest components  of  the  electronics\r\n\r\nsector,  is  starting  to see book to bill ratios  coming  down,\r\n\r\nwhich  means that orders are coming down.  Similarly,  the  disk\r\n\r\ndrive industry is seeing a slowdown.  The Commerce Department in\r\n\r\nthe  USA  recently published, just a few days ago, figures  that\r\n\r\nshowed  a  drop of about 2.6% in January for electronic products\r\n\r\nshipped  out of the USA.  Factory inventories were  also  up  by\r\n\r\nabout 0.1%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore am a little worried that we may not be aligned\r\n\r\nand  hence  the  Budget may have been drawn based on  statistics\r\n\r\nthat  may  not  be up to date, especially in this fast  changing\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has projected a 2.5% to 4.5% growth for the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy.  In my opinion, although this may turn out to\r\n\r\nbe  so  for the overall economy, certain sectors of the  economy\r\n\r\nmay,  in  fact,  go into recession later this  year.   This  may\r\n\r\nhappen   in  the  manufacturing  sector,  especially   for   the\r\n\r\nelectronic  products area.  The retail and tourism  sectors  are\r\n\r\nset to see one of the worst times in the last 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the Government have done? In my opinion, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance could have been a little more proactive  to\r\n\r\nanticipate  a  possible sudden downturn rather than  waiting  to\r\n\r\nreact  when  it happens.  In this environment of rapid  changes,\r\n\r\nwhy should we wait for a crisis to happen?  We must have learned\r\n\r\nfrom our neighbours that when it starts to fall, it will be  too\r\n\r\nlate  to reverse things. As Mr Leong Horn Kee has stated,  there\r\n\r\nare  surveys  done  by  the Chambers of Commerce  and  also  the\r\n\r\nConfederation of Industries that about 50% to 60% of  businesses\r\n\r\nexpect  to  see a drastic fall in sales and profits  this  year.\r\n\r\nAlso  in the last few days, from the newspaper reports, we  have\r\n\r\nseen  very  disappointing corporate results.  So in my  opinion,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  could  have given the benefit  of  doubt  to  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses and the feedback that they have given about the tough\r\n\r\ntimes ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my contention that at worst, we over stimulate the\r\n\r\neconomy a little should the situation not be as bad as predicted\r\n\r\nand  at  best,  we could have avoided a crisis  by  acting  very\r\n\r\nearly.  In either case, Singapore would have gained tremendously\r\n\r\nshould  the Budget have been more generous in helping businesses\r\n\r\naddress   competitiveness  and  the  regional   crisis   issues.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  Minister mentioned the possibility of  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures, I hope that he can clarify how fast he would  be  able\r\n\r\nto  react  and  how will this be done.  Businesses  need  to  be\r\n\r\nassured  that  the help will come on time when  they  needed  it\r\n\r\nmost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manufacturing Sector, SMEs and Regionalisation Drive - The Cost of Doing Business</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the cost of doing business in Singapore becomes an\r\n\r\neven  more  critical issue as the currencies of  our  neighbours\r\n\r\nhave  devalued  and thus making these countries more  attractive\r\n\r\nfor  investors because of the cheaper land and labour costs.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore feel that the Budget did not adequately address  these\r\n\r\nissues  and in particular, it did not address the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and the small and medium enterprises sectors, as I\r\n\r\nhave pointed out earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the rationale for the lack of attention to\r\n\r\nthese sectors, but I fear we may be giving the wrong signals  to\r\n\r\ncurrent  businesses  and  potential  new  investors  as  to  the\r\n\r\nimportance they have to our overall economy.  While the  overall\r\n\r\neconomy  has slowed down and as competition from our  neighbours\r\n\r\nincreases,  business costs in Singapore still remain  high.   As\r\n\r\nour  neighbours become more competitive and increase their focus\r\n\r\non the sectors of the economy which we are neglecting, they will\r\n\r\nbe  successful  in attracting investments that  otherwise  could\r\n\r\nhave been brought into Singapore.  Worse, we may see flights  of\r\n\r\ninvestments out of Singapore to our neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small and medium enterprises form an important pillar\r\n\r\nof  our  economy, employing a large percentage of our workforce.\r\n\r\nThe regional crisis has a bigger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpact on them because these companies get jerked around due  to\r\n\r\ntheir  smallness.  These companies need special help, especially\r\n\r\nfor  those  who have regionalised in the last few years.   While\r\n\r\nthere  are  many Government schemes to help them,  the  feedback\r\n\r\nthat we have got from most of them is that these schemes are  so\r\n\r\ncomplex that they just give up trying to apply.  We need  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  organised in helping the small and medium enterprises more\r\n\r\neffectively.   Currently,  I  feel that  the  bigger  companies,\r\n\r\nespecially  multinational companies, are  the  ones  that  truly\r\n\r\nbenefit from these schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of regionalisation, once again, I feel that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has been too quickly distracted by its narrow  focus\r\n\r\non  a few sectors.  Our long-term directions should still be  to\r\n\r\nregionalise  and  to  further develop the  second  wing  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   I  therefore expected more to be  done  to  encourage\r\n\r\nregionalisation,  especially this is a  good  time  for  bargain\r\n\r\ninvestments in our neighbouring countries.  Therefore, the  lack\r\n\r\nof  new  initiatives in the Budget to encourage  regionalisation\r\n\r\nwas  a  let  down.  Furthermore, for companies that had  already\r\n\r\nregionalised  in  the  last two years, the regional  crisis  has\r\n\r\nbadly  impacted them in terms of loss of value of assets in  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries as well as due to inability  to  collect\r\n\r\ndebts.  I was hoping for some temporary relief measures to  such\r\n\r\ncompanies to tide over these tough times, such as provisions for\r\n\r\nlosses  in  computing their taxes here in Singapore on  a  group\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to refer the Minister for Finance to an\r\n\r\narticle that appeared in the Straits Times on 28th February 1998\r\n\r\nthat  analysed  why the Taiwan economy was able to  weather  the\r\n\r\nregional  turmoil while strong economies like  South  Korea  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia collapsed.  In the final analysis, among other  things,\r\n\r\ntwo  of  the  most significant reasons are, first  of  all,  the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness   of  the  Taiwan  economy   is   due   to   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector and, in particular, the electronics and the\r\n\r\nsemiconductor industries which have grown from a  mere  2.5%  in\r\n\r\n1990 to 37.5% of the economy in 1997.  Secondly, Taiwan was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfocused  on  many small and medium sized businesses rather  than\r\n\r\nconglomerates  or  big  companies,  thus  giving   the   economy\r\n\r\nflexibility compared to other countries who were focused on  its\r\n\r\nlarge companies.  While I am not suggesting that we emulate  the\r\n\r\nTaiwanese economy, I do believe that there are many lessons that\r\n\r\nwe can learn from them  and apply to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strong Dollar/Rising Interest Rates and Financing Problems</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, while the Singapore dollar has depreciated only\r\n\r\nslightly  against the OECD currencies, those of  our  neighbours\r\n\r\nhave  drastically  devalued.  Therefore, more than  before,  the\r\n\r\nstrength   of  Singapore  dollar  becomes  a  bigger  issue   in\r\n\r\nattracting  investments and in competing in the  export  of  our\r\n\r\ngoods.  I believe that Singapore needs to re-assess the level at\r\n\r\nwhich  our dollar should be, compared to other currencies around\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to moderate interest rate increases which have\r\n\r\ngone  up  about three times in the last six months.   Banks  are\r\n\r\nalso  tightening credit financing, thus making it very difficult\r\n\r\nfor businesses that can still grow and be successful in the long\r\n\r\nterm  in  getting loans.  With losses made worse by the regional\r\n\r\ncurrency crisis, many companies are facing short-term cash  flow\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this area, I would like to urge the Finance Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  providing temporary measures to help  those  countries\r\n\r\nthat  are  willing to restructure and by independent  assessment\r\n\r\nare  companies  capable of growing and competing effectively  in\r\n\r\nthe  world  markets.   These  are  companies  which  are  facing\r\n\r\ntransient  problems, not permanent problems, and  they  need  to\r\n\r\nsurvive through the next two years or so.  I would like to  make\r\n\r\none suggestion, and I will be talking about the details when  we\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the  various Ministries, and that  is,  to  provide  an\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  an  IMF  bailout package  that  was  offered  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia, for our own businesses here.  This package can be  in\r\n\r\nthe  form  of  bank loans with some Government backing.   Others\r\n\r\ninclude\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvarious types of rebates that have already been mentioned.   The\r\n\r\ntemporary  measures  need  not be  handouts,  but  one-off  type\r\n\r\nassistance  that  will  not  impact the  long-term  measures  or\r\n\r\npolicies of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Property Sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one area where I feel that the Government has done\r\n\r\ntoo  much.   As  I  recall, the general tone of  our  Government\r\n\r\npolicy  has always been that we should let market forces  decide\r\n\r\nthe  property  prices.  However, in the last few years,  I  have\r\n\r\nnoticed  that many incidences of Government interventions  where\r\n\r\nsometimes we tempered with the demand and sometimes we  tempered\r\n\r\nwith  the  supply  in  a seemingly uncoordinated  and  piecemeal\r\n\r\nmanner resulting in the sector being jerked around many times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to encourage the Government to go back to the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  `letting  the market forces  decide'  and  to  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  only  setting general directions  and  fundamental\r\n\r\nstrategies and then let go.  While we have made mistakes in  the\r\n\r\npast  in  allowing asset price inflation in Singapore and  hence\r\n\r\nproperty prices being out of control, and while I can understand\r\n\r\nthe  undesirable  impact on our economy if the  property  market\r\n\r\nbubble  bursts, I hope that no new measures would be put  in  to\r\n\r\nprop  up  the  market.  In May 1996, we had put in  measures  to\r\n\r\nremove  speculations  in  the property market.   The  objectives\r\n\r\nshould  not  change now.  We should never allow  speculation  in\r\n\r\nland  scarce Singapore.  These measures must therefore stay even\r\n\r\nif prices slide downwards a little more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote Mr Chiang Pin-Kung, not in Mandarin\r\n\r\nbut  in  English,  the  Chairman of  the  Taiwanese  Council  of\r\n\r\nEconomic  Planning and Development, who said  \"A  lot  of  money\r\n\r\nborrowed in South-east Asia went not into manufacturing but into\r\n\r\nthe  stock and property market\", when he analysed the causes  of\r\n\r\nthe regional turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, while we know of people being unhappy\r\n\r\nof  the  income tax rebate being reduced by 5%, I would like  to\r\n\r\nhighlight that a majority of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  got many other rebates like rental, utilities  and\r\n\r\nS&C  rebates.  I am sure this will help many of them, as we know\r\n\r\nabout  70% of Singaporeans do not in fact pay income  tax.   The\r\n\r\nother  area that I would like to compliment the Minister  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  area  of  development expenditures that have gone  up  this\r\n\r\nyear.   This  reflects the long-term thinking of the  Government\r\n\r\nand  willingness  to  invest in our future.   We  will  see  the\r\n\r\nresults many years from now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude, once again, by urging the\r\n\r\nGovernment to be more pro-active and not reactive in determining\r\n\r\npolicies, as this Budget has indicated.  In this case, we cannot\r\n\r\nwait  for  companies  to  collapse  before  we  step  in.    The\r\n\r\naccelerated loss of confidence if this happens cannot be  easily\r\n\r\nrecovered  as  we  recently learned from what  happened  to  our\r\n\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I applaud the Government for focusing on the finance\r\n\r\nsector  for our long-term good, I feel that we should  not  have\r\n\r\nneglected  the other important sectors of our economy.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe   Government  will  show  more  signs  to  substantiate  its\r\n\r\ncommitment  in making manufacturing and services the engines  of\r\n\r\ngrowth for our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I welcome the\r\n\r\nBudget  presented  by  the  Finance  Minister.   It  calls   for\r\n\r\ntripartite cooperation among the business sector, the Government\r\n\r\nand  the people to overcome the financial crisis before us.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  I  would like to commend  the  Government  for\r\n\r\ngranting  rebates  and  a whole series  of  assistance  for  the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  to overcome the present difficulties brought  about\r\n\r\nby  the currency crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the South-east Asian countries, 1998 is going to be a\r\n\r\nvery  difficult and painful year.  The political factors in  the\r\n\r\ncountries around us are uncertain and their economies are  still\r\n\r\nvery  unstable.  In such circumstances, I am of the opinion that\r\n\r\nthis  Budget  is  prudent and balanced.   It  could  ensure  the\r\n\r\norderly development of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I personally feel that in this Budget, the\r\n\r\nGovernment appears to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo optimistic about the impact of the regional financial crisis\r\n\r\non  Singapore.   According to information  I  gathered  from  my\r\n\r\nfriends in the business sector, the impact of this crisis is far\r\n\r\nreaching.   Recovery is unlikely in the next one to  two  years,\r\n\r\nespecially  for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs).   These\r\n\r\npeople feel that the impact this time is much greater than  what\r\n\r\nis   being  reflected  in  the  statistics  of  the  Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  fear that the Government has  not  sent  a  clear\r\n\r\nsignal to the people. It may well give them the wrong impression\r\n\r\nthat  the  regional financial crisis is merely a  \"flu\"  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Finance Minister has indicated that if the\r\n\r\neconomy  should  suddenly take a downturn, the  Government  will\r\n\r\nconsider  taking  off-Budget measures to  cushion  the  problem.\r\n\r\nBecause  the Government has all the resources to deal  with  any\r\n\r\nunexpected  event,  many Singaporeans feel that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  give a more definite and specific indication on  how  it\r\n\r\nwill  deal with this crisis, in terms of the impact and the long\r\n\r\nlasting  effect  on  our  economy, and take  more  comprehensive\r\n\r\nmeasures  to prepare for any rainy days ahead.   This is  better\r\n\r\nthan  taking  some temporary measures  only when  something  has\r\n\r\ngone  wrong.  Prevention is better than cure.  I feel that under\r\n\r\nthe  able leadership of the Government, we will be able to  take\r\n\r\nmore positive measures to deal with this crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long-term interest, the Government has provided more\r\n\r\nfor  the education of our young, a substantial increase by  some\r\n\r\n30%.   I  am  very  happy about it because despite  the  present\r\n\r\neconomic  uncertainties, the Government has not  overlooked  the\r\n\r\nlong-term investment for the long-term interest of our  country.\r\n\r\nI think this is very good.  The Government is always emphasizing\r\n\r\nthe  fact that our only natural resource is our talented people.\r\n\r\nFor  this  reason, more money should be  devoted  to  education,\r\n\r\ntraining and opportunities for the upgrading of our people.   We\r\n\r\nmust  ensure  that our education system remains world-class,  to\r\n\r\ndevelop and nurture our young\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalents.  At the same time, the Government wants to recruit more\r\n\r\ntalents  from  all over the world to develop Singapore  into  an\r\n\r\noasis  of talents, with foreign talents supplementing our  local\r\n\r\ntalents,  to  ensure that we remain in front, to deal  with  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  ahead of us.   To show its support,  the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  granted  double tax deduction for recruitment cost incurred\r\n\r\nby  companies  which  recruit  professionals  and  experts  from\r\n\r\noverseas.  The Government is also committed to studying  how  to\r\n\r\nimprove the \"heart-ware\" simultaneously with the improvement  to\r\n\r\nthe  hardware,  so that the imported talents can integrate  into\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   society,  thereby  remaining  permanently   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  make a contribution towards the  development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This intention is good and well thought of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think that while it is good to introduce foreign\r\n\r\ntalents to Singapore,  we should also make the best use  of  our\r\n\r\nlocal  talent  pool.  While attracting foreign  talents,  if  we\r\n\r\noverlook  the problem of brain-drain from Singapore  or  if  the\r\n\r\nproblem  is  not  properly dealt with,   it  may  give  rise  to\r\n\r\nnegative results.  The people may get the wrong impression  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is adopting a double standard in  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nsituation, and unintentionally undermine the confidence and self-respect of our local talents, thereby causing them to migrate to\r\n\r\nother  countries.   This will be a serious  loss  to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhere our human resource is very precious to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, three scholars who broke their scholarship bond\r\n\r\nhad  their  names  published by the EDB and NCB.  This  practice\r\n\r\nhas  indeed shocked the public and created a controversy.  There\r\n\r\nwere a few articles written by the readers and published in  the\r\n\r\nLianhe  Zaobao  over  the past few days  on  this  matter.    Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it  is not right for overseas scholars to  break  their\r\n\r\nbonds.  We should take measures to review the situation.  But to\r\n\r\npublish  the  names of the bond breakers in order to  achieve  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent effect, is something really worth re-considering.   To\r\n\r\nthe  public, the breaking of bonds is only a breach of contract.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not a criminal offence per se.  It should be dealt  with\r\n\r\naccording to the terms and conditions in the contract or the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbond.  If payment has been made for breaking the bond, including\r\n\r\nthe  interest  incurred  and perhaps some  form  of  penalty  or\r\n\r\ncompensation, then the matter should be closed.    EDB  and  NCB\r\n\r\nhave  chosen  to publish the names of the bond breakers  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers and this seems to rank them among the criminals.    I\r\n\r\nthink  this is unreasonable and unfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote from the article published in the\r\n\r\nLianhe  Zaobao.   Mr Loo Ching Koon said in the article that  we\r\n\r\nshould consider four key issues: Firstly, on what basis are  the\r\n\r\nscholarships  established?  Secondly, why are the recipients  of\r\n\r\nscholarships  required to sign a bond?  Thirdly,  what  are  the\r\n\r\nreasons for them to break their bonds?  Fourthly, why the  names\r\n\r\nof  the  bond  breakers have to be published?  Will  this  be  a\r\n\r\npractice from now on and do the bond breakers still need to  pay\r\n\r\ncompensation for breaking the bond?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the purpose of setting up scholarships is to\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  talents, so that they will  return   to  work  and\r\n\r\ncontribute to our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article also says that we should be magnanimous by\r\n\r\nlooking at the world as a whole and to understand that there are\r\n\r\nrapid  changes  whether in terms of concepts   or  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ntechnology.  We cannot remain static all the time.  If  we  stay\r\n\r\nwhere  we are, we will be lagging behind and will eventually  be\r\n\r\neliminated.   We will not be able to compete in the  world.   We\r\n\r\nshould   change  our  attitude  towards  scholarships  and   the\r\n\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDB spokesman has also pointed out, as reported in the\r\n\r\nLianhe Zaobao on 27th February,  that in future, applicants  who\r\n\r\ncome from well-to-do families will be asked probing questions on\r\n\r\nwhy  they  are applying for the scholarship when they  can  well\r\n\r\nafford  to go on overseas studies on their own means.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  will  worry   the  well-to-do families.   They  feel  that\r\n\r\nscholarship is different from bursaries.  Applicants  apply  for\r\n\r\nscholarship  on their own merits in fair competition.   If  they\r\n\r\nare  selected, they are selected on the basis of merit,  not  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  poverty or wealth.  Regardless of  their  family\r\n\r\nbackground, so long as the children have good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresults  and  good  merit,  they  are  eligible  to  apply   for\r\n\r\nscholarships  and they should be treated equally.   They  should\r\n\r\nnot be discriminated against and they should not be subjected to\r\n\r\nsuch  acute  and probing questions.  If we consider  the  family\r\n\r\nbackground of the applicants in awarding the scholarships,  then\r\n\r\nit  will lose the true meaning of these scholarship awards.  Our\r\n\r\nscholarships should not be turned into bursaries or study loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way the EDB and NCB handled the matter of these three\r\n\r\nbond breakers  is very regrettable indeed. It  gives people  the\r\n\r\nwrong  impression that while, on the one hand,  we  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  attracting foreign talents to come to Singapore  to  work\r\n\r\nand  to  settle down by giving them all kinds of privileges,  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  we are punishing our own local  talents  just\r\n\r\nbecause  they break their bonds, by publishing their  names  and\r\n\r\nshaming  them  in  public.    I  think  this  will  lead  to   a\r\n\r\ncentrifugal  tendency among our local talents, causing  them  to\r\n\r\nstay  away  from Singapore.   They may just remain overseas  for\r\n\r\ngood.   This  will  be  against  Singapore's  motto  that  human\r\n\r\nresource is the best resource that we have. It is also  a  waste\r\n\r\nof our investment in education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the free flow of talents is a world-wide trend. All\r\n\r\ncountries  are competing for the best talents to work for  them.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we should become more enlightened, more flexible  in\r\n\r\nhandling the question of overseas scholarships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's budget debate, I mentioned that the number\r\n\r\nof years for a bond should be reviewed for overseas scholarships\r\n\r\nso  that  our best talents can be attracted to stay here.   Now,\r\n\r\nwith  this practice of shaming the bond breakers, I feel that  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  our young talents will turn to scholarships offered  by\r\n\r\noverseas  universities, many of which are provided  without  any\r\n\r\nbonds  attached. Therefore, we should review our  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nbond  to make them more attractive.  For those who return  after\r\n\r\ncompleting their courses of study under the scholarship schemes,\r\n\r\nso  long as they come back to Singapore to work for the country,\r\n\r\nwhether they work for the Government or in the private sector, I\r\n\r\nthink it is acceptable.  As Mr Leong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHorn  Kee has already mentioned, he himself had broken the  bond\r\n\r\nbut he is still serving  Singapore.  So if you feel that this is\r\n\r\ntoo  liberal, then we should consider shortening the  period  of\r\n\r\nthe  bond.   After  two  years of service  in  the  ministry  or\r\n\r\nstatutory  board concerned, I think they should  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nserve  in  another capacity, as long as it is in  Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nthink   this   arrangement  is  better,  because  the   eligible\r\n\r\ncandidates will not be compelled to go for overseas scholarships\r\n\r\nand  stay overseas.  If the scholars want to extend their  study\r\n\r\nperiod  overseas,  they  should  also  be  given  more  flexible\r\n\r\narrangements so that they will be able to complete their  higher\r\n\r\nstudies before coming back to Singapore to serve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Public Service Commission would take the lead in\r\n\r\nstudying this issue together with other Government agencies.   I\r\n\r\nthink this will have far-reaching effects when we enter the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the Government will pay special attention\r\n\r\nto  the  attitude  of  senior Government officers.    When  they\r\n\r\nannounce  certain policies or when they receive  feedback  which\r\n\r\nare  contrary  to the Government policy, they seem  to  be  very\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  and  very arrogant.  When members  of  the  public\r\n\r\nreflect the views of the people, the senior officers should  not\r\n\r\nstick  to  their  own  views  and become  very  discourteous  to\r\n\r\nMembers.   I  think this is wrong.  They must  not  forget  that\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament are representatives of the people.   They\r\n\r\nmust  speak for the people.  The senior Government officers  are\r\n\r\nGovernment servants.  So they should not put the cart before the\r\n\r\nhorse.   They should not think that they are Ministers and  they\r\n\r\nare  masters of the people.  It will be very regrettable if they\r\n\r\nthink so.  I hope  the Government will pay attention to this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in this budget, the Government has decided to\r\n\r\ngrant an across-the-board 5% income tax rebate  and  to increase\r\n\r\nthe  interest  for the Special Account in the CPF.    There  are\r\n\r\nalso  rebates for public utilities, SC&CC to help the people  to\r\n\r\novercome their difficulties.  All these show that in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nface  of  the economic uncertainties, the Government  can  still\r\n\r\ncontinue to care and share with the people, especially the lower\r\n\r\nincome  group. I am very happy about this.  I hope that  in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of a financial crisis, the Government should continue  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the people to go global.  In Chinese, the  two  words\r\n\r\nfor   crisis   are  wei  ji,  literally  meaning:   danger   and\r\n\r\nopportunities. So long as we are careful and prudent in handling\r\n\r\nthe situation, the dangers can be reduced, the opportunities can\r\n\r\nbe  increased. We must seize the opportunities and this is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, although the economic turmoil in the world has not seen its\r\n\r\nend as yet, the Budget presented by the Minister for Finance, Dr\r\n\r\nRichard Hu, has been able to provide the people with a number of\r\n\r\nreliefs  and  rebates which are very well received, particularly\r\n\r\nthose that touch or concern their pockets.  Although the amounts\r\n\r\nmay  be  reduced such as the 5% tax rebate which  is appreciated\r\n\r\nby  the  people  who  are appreciative of  the  efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I think in giving the reliefs and rebates,  perhaps\r\n\r\nthere  might  be a more equitable means which we  can  apply  to\r\n\r\nensure that those who truly need the rebates and reliefs receive\r\n\r\nthe  assistance provided.  I am referring to the  rebates  given\r\n\r\nfor  the  greatest majority of Singaporeans who live  in  public\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced by Dr Richard Hu, the Government will be\r\n\r\ngranting rebates to HDB flat owners, including those who live in\r\n\r\nthe  larger  flats, ie, 4- and 5-room flats.   The  4-room  flat\r\n\r\nowners,  for instance, will be receiving all the rebates  except\r\n\r\nrental  rebates, and this is appropriate because  there  are  no\r\n\r\nrental  4-room flats.  5-room HDB flat owners will be  receiving\r\n\r\nthe  S&C   rebates.  In my opinion, a fairer and more  equitable\r\n\r\nmeans,  although it might be more complicated, would be to  give\r\n\r\nthe  rebates based on the per capita income of each family,  and\r\n\r\nnot  on  the flat size.  This will enable us to provide a better\r\n\r\nmeans of assistance to those who truly need them.  I do not mean\r\n\r\nto  say  that  we should not provide rebates to those  who  earn\r\n\r\nhigher incomes.  They should be entitled to such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrebates.   But  I think a more accurate picture of  ascertaining\r\n\r\nthe financial ability of Singaporeans would be through their per\r\n\r\ncapita income. Surely, we realise the ability of Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nown  cars  when  we notice that our public housing  estates  are\r\n\r\nalways  congested with cars owned by the residents in the  area.\r\n\r\nThese  vehicles include not only the small cars  such  as  Mazda\r\n\r\n1.5, etc., but also luxury cars such as Mercedes and BMW.  These\r\n\r\nluxury vehicles can also be seen in 4-room flat precincts in our\r\n\r\npublic  housing estates.  So a relief based on per capita income\r\n\r\nis  more  appropriate  as a criterion for providing  rebates  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is on the personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax relief. This concerns the relief provided  to  those\r\n\r\nwho  are looking after their parents and disabled siblings.   In\r\n\r\nour effort to encourage children to continue to look after their\r\n\r\nparents,  we should perhaps also extend the relief to  the  four\r\n\r\nparents, ie, one's own parents and parents-in-law.  In this way,\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  helping  to  prevent and  reduce  misunderstanding\r\n\r\nbetween parents and parents-in-law because they are given  equal\r\n\r\nattention  by  their  children and  children-in-law.   The  same\r\n\r\nrelief  can  also be given not only to just one's  own  disabled\r\n\r\nsiblings but also disabled siblings-in-law and relatives who are\r\n\r\nunable to go out to earn their own living.  I believe this  will\r\n\r\ngo   a  long  way  towards  strengthening  family  values  among\r\n\r\nthemselves,  whether between parents and their own children,  or\r\n\r\nbetween parents-in-law and relatives in the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I would like to touch on is our state of\r\n\r\npreparedness in facing the economic turmoil in this  region.  We\r\n\r\nhave  often  heard how the people in neighbouring countries  are\r\n\r\nforced  to  scramble in order to obtain their daily  necessities\r\n\r\nsuch as rice and sugar which obviously have fallen far short  in\r\n\r\nsupply.  I  believe  the  Government has taken  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  prepare  ourselves  for  any  possibility  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  situation getting worse.  But what are these measures?\r\n\r\nCan these measures ensure that in Singapore we will not be faced\r\n\r\nwith a shortage of basic necessities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to touch on the Government's support\r\n\r\nfor  the  training of our workers so that they can  continue  to\r\n\r\ncompete  in  this  challenging world.   In  my  opinion,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  Government to  provide  as  much  financial\r\n\r\nsupport as possible to ensure that our workers will continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  able to compete.  In this respect, we all realise that Malay\r\n\r\nworkers  form  the largest group of workers who are  lacking  in\r\n\r\nskills.   I fear that the concerns which have been raised  about\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment recently will affect more Malay workers.\r\n\r\nIf more financial support could be provided for this purpose,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  more active efforts can be carried out to  assist  this\r\n\r\ngroup of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.05 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the financial policy of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Fortune magazine in its 12th January 1998 issue\r\n\r\nfeatured  \"The 100 Best Companies to work for in  America\".   In\r\n\r\nthis  feature, there are a number of characteristics which  make\r\n\r\nthe  100  companies good employers.  First and  foremost,  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  work  hard to retain their best  workers.   Employees\r\n\r\ntalk  of  their companies as fun places to work. These companies\r\n\r\nexercise flexibility and balance the employee's work and family.\r\n\r\nMoney,  though  important, is not the  criterion  why  employees\r\n\r\nremain  in  those  organisations.  In short, these  corporations\r\n\r\naccentuate  the positive and place a premium on their employees.\r\n\r\nTalent is a very valuable resource in the 100 best companies  to\r\n\r\nwork  for  in  America.   Contrast  this  with  what  we  do  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we say very much the same thing. In the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister's Budget, he speaks of \"human talent has always\r\n\r\nbeen  our  most precious resource, and will become  increasingly\r\n\r\ncritical as we develop into a knowledge-based economy\".  He went\r\n\r\nso  far as to offer double tax deduction for approved relocation\r\n\r\nand  recruitment  expenses for hiring talent  from  abroad.   In\r\n\r\nother words, there is a Government subsidy for bringing in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforeign  talent.  This, I support.  Yet, Sir, on the  very  same\r\n\r\nday,  on the front pages of our major newspapers, two Government\r\n\r\nagencies, the EDB and NCB, announced the names of three scholars\r\n\r\nwho  terminated their bonds.  Their crime seems to be that  they\r\n\r\nhave  decided  to  return the monies they have  spent  in  their\r\n\r\nacademic  pursuit. They terminated their contracts and  returned\r\n\r\nthe monies with interest and penalties.  No Government subsidies\r\n\r\nhere,  but a rather heavy penalty for being talented.   Have  we\r\n\r\nbeen  too  harsh?  Contrast this approach with that of  the  100\r\n\r\nbest corporations in America.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which this issue was handled, one cannot help\r\n\r\nbut  feel sorry for Mrs Janet Yee, the mother of Hector Yee, one\r\n\r\nof  the  scholars named. As a mother who sees her  son's  future\r\n\r\nbeing  potentially ruined, she has every right to use  the  word\r\n\r\n\"wicked\"   on  these  two  organisations.   Her  very  interview\r\n\r\nreported  in the Straits Times on the same day made the agencies\r\n\r\nlooked vindictive and small.   How have we come to this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the joint statement, the EDB and NCB claimed that naming\r\n\r\nthose who terminated their bonds is not to shame these scholars.\r\n\r\nThis sounds disingenuous.  If splashing the names of scholars in\r\n\r\nsuch  statements is not meant to shame or scare  other  scholars\r\n\r\nfrom  thinking or doing likewise, then what is the very  purpose\r\n\r\nof  doing  so?  It may be argued that the use of terms  such  as\r\n\r\nbond-breaker  and breaking bond are emotional terms  similar  to\r\n\r\nlaw-breaker and breaking the law.  Anything you break cannot  be\r\n\r\nright.  Perhaps it is calculated to be so.  Singaporeans take  a\r\n\r\nserious  view of names being flashed by those in authority.   In\r\n\r\nthe  context of bond termination, surely the purpose must be  to\r\n\r\nstrike  fear.  In the Straits Times of 1st March 1998,  page  3,\r\n\r\nthe  heading of the box article was headlined \"THE NAME  SHAME\".\r\n\r\nHere, it is the press calling a spade a spade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote two of the interviewees. One said\r\n\r\n\"Singaporeans  are afraid of embarrassment, so publishing  names\r\n\r\nis like the Corrective Work Order\".  Another\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomment  \"EDB's and NCB's actions would turn people  off.   They\r\n\r\nare  using  it  as a threat.  But if the future employer  trusts\r\n\r\nyou, this measure is ineffective\".  Sir, the operative phrase is\r\n\r\n\"if  the  future  employer trusts you\".  Singapore  is  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry when it comes to the work place.  It is not uncommon  to\r\n\r\nhear  of employers who shun from employing Singaporeans who have\r\n\r\nincurred  the displeasure of Government or Government  agencies.\r\n\r\nAlthough this perception is not true, employers do not wish   to\r\n\r\ntake chances on doing the wrong thing.  Hence, public naming  of\r\n\r\nscholars has very deep repercussions.  We can understand Mrs Yee\r\n\r\nwhen  she said that she is afraid that her son may not come home\r\n\r\n-  home to an uncertain future.  Some form of disapproval can be\r\n\r\nexpressed, Sir, in the case of those who terminated their bonds,\r\n\r\nbut have we gone too far?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the joint statement, EDB and NCB stated, and I quote,\r\n\r\n\"Accepting a scholarship implies a moral responsibility to  work\r\n\r\nwith  the sponsor upon graduation\".  Certainly, scholars do have\r\n\r\nan  obligation other than legal to serve their bonds.  We cannot\r\n\r\nencourage  scholars  to  terminate  their  bonds.   Moreover,  a\r\n\r\nscholarship in Singapore brings much honour and prestige to  the\r\n\r\nscholar  and the family.  Hence, terminating a bond  must  bring\r\n\r\nwith it some dishonour.  At the same time, with  this very heavy\r\n\r\nhanded approach, is there not a moral responsibility on the part\r\n\r\nof these Government agencies to protect Singaporeans like Hector\r\n\r\nYee,  Teo Hoon Ping and Huang Yian Teik, whose crime is to incur\r\n\r\nthe wrath of some Government officials?  They do so by returning\r\n\r\nmonies  advanced  to them - and this action is  contemplated  in\r\n\r\ntheir  contracts, and then have themselves shamed.  This is  not\r\n\r\nin  the contract.  Some form of displeasure must be attached  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  terminate their bonds.  However, when  a  Government\r\n\r\nagency uses the moral argument, it must remember that it owes  a\r\n\r\nhigher  moral duty through its sheer size, influence  and  clout\r\n\r\nnot  to overuse its power  on individuals it comes into contract\r\n\r\nwith.  The exercise of moral responsibility is never\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeant to be one sided.  Hence, I agree with Tan Sai Siong of the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  when she said  that two wrongs  do  not  make  a\r\n\r\nright.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Straits Times of 1st March 1998, it was reported\r\n\r\nthat  in the case of the PSC, only 4% of the scholars terminated\r\n\r\ntheir bonds in the last five years.  The URA has reported in the\r\n\r\nsame article that none of its overseas scholars terminated their\r\n\r\nbonds - a very enviable record.  Obviously, Sir, the PSC and the\r\n\r\nURA  must  be  doing something right.  Why is the  situation  so\r\n\r\ndifferent in the EDB and the NCB?  Sir, going by press  reports,\r\n\r\nperhaps  these two organisations should examine their  attitudes\r\n\r\nand inflexibility of approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, Sir, I have an experience which lends weight to\r\n\r\nthis  point.  On 12th October last year, I made a public  speech\r\n\r\nagainst naming of scholars who terminated their bonds.  This was\r\n\r\nreported  in the Straits Times and Zaobao on 13th October  1997.\r\n\r\nIn that address, Sir, I suggested that whilst the Government was\r\n\r\ntrying  hard to bring in foreign talent to increase  our  talent\r\n\r\npool, shaming scholars ran counter to this objective.  We should\r\n\r\ninstead increase the number of scholarships by anticipating  the\r\n\r\nsmall number who may terminate their bonds.  Moreover, Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  the financial resources to do so.  The other reason I  gave\r\n\r\nthen was that as long as the scholar continued to contribute his\r\n\r\nservices  to  Singapore, as my friend, Mr Leong  Horn  Kee,  has\r\n\r\nmentioned, the country has lost little.  Whether in the  private\r\n\r\nsector or public sector, a scholar can contribute to Singapore's\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this did not go down well with EDB. I was invited to\r\n\r\na  breakfast  meeting in January this year with the most  senior\r\n\r\nofficers of EDB and NCB.  I was shown a draft statement of their\r\n\r\nintention  to  name three scholars who terminated  their  bonds.\r\n\r\nAmongst  many  things said to me at this breakfast meeting,  the\r\n\r\nmost  senior  gentleman in the group accused me of  sharing  the\r\n\r\nvalues of these scholars and he said that if I shared the values\r\n\r\nof  these scholars I should resign from public office.  In other\r\n\r\nwords, a civil servant telling an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMP  to  resign.  Despite this, Sir, I tried to keep a cool head.\r\n\r\nI  tried to debate the issue but to no avail.  We must always be\r\n\r\non the lookout for such intolerant attitudes, especially of some\r\n\r\nin the apex of Government.  We cannot value human resource if we\r\n\r\nare not able to win over those who do not see our point of view.\r\n\r\nI  bring  up  this episode not with personal affront,  but  with\r\n\r\nsadness because today  the PERC Report says Singapore has one of\r\n\r\nthe best civil service in this part of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of scholarship bonds should not be encouraged.\r\n\r\nSignificant  resources other than money have  been  invested  in\r\n\r\nthose  scholars.   In some cases, the award of  the  scholarship\r\n\r\nenables the scholars to gain admission into the most prestigious\r\n\r\ninstitutions  overseas.  As the large majority  of  scholars  do\r\n\r\nserve  their bonds on completion of their studies, the situation\r\n\r\nis  probably not getting out of hand.  Even though the  regional\r\n\r\neconomies  are in turmoil, I believe that the demand for  talent\r\n\r\nwill  continue.  Hence, there should be a review of this  issue.\r\n\r\nThere must be more creative solutions to this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, since we are on the lookout for talent, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   should  allocate  more  financial   resources   for\r\n\r\nscholarships.  As an example, a million dollars will see  to  at\r\n\r\nleast five scholars a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, perhaps we should consider providing scholarship\r\n\r\nloans which may be converted into service bonds.  Such a scheme,\r\n\r\nwhich  comes  with a small `penalty' like a longer bond  period,\r\n\r\nwill  give  the scholarship holder the flexibility of making  up\r\n\r\nhis  or  her mind after a few years of studies, bearing in  mind\r\n\r\nthat the scholar has taken up a scholarship at a very young age.\r\n\r\nIf  the  scholar chooses to continue further studies,  then  the\r\n\r\nloan  must  be  paid up.  If the scholar chooses to  return  and\r\n\r\nserve a Government agency, the bond is of a longer duration than\r\n\r\nthe norm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the terms of the bond should be liberalised\r\n\r\nfurther.  The recent announcement of a shortening of the  period\r\n\r\nis a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly,  perhaps  there should be a class of  scholarships  with\r\n\r\nbonds  which  may not be terminated.  In other words,  the  bond\r\n\r\nmust  be fulfilled.  The period may be shortened further.   This\r\n\r\nlatter  scholarship  will  go some way  towards  addressing  the\r\n\r\nconcerns  of those Government agencies which have earmarked  the\r\n\r\nscholars for certain positions in the establishment.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  ways  to  vary  the  terms of employment  to  achieve  our\r\n\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, in the wider context of increasing our\r\n\r\ntalent pool, nurturing talent and attracting talent from abroad,\r\n\r\nthe  public  shaming of scholars who terminate their bonds  must\r\n\r\nnot  be part of the grand design.  Putting such scholars on  the\r\n\r\nsame  class as road bullies, Corrective Work Order offenders  or\r\n\r\nthose  who choose to use our lifts as public toilets is  not  in\r\n\r\nthe  best interest of Singapore.  The natural progression, I ask\r\n\r\nmyself, is that if this does not work, what will EDB and NCB do?\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the next logical step is to paste the faces of scholars\r\n\r\non lift landings.  Sir, I think we need more creative solutions,\r\n\r\nand I think we are better than the loan-sharks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nofficial GDP forecast for this year has a very wide range,  2.5%\r\n\r\nto 4.5%.  This is understandable because of the uncertainties in\r\n\r\nthe  regional environment.  However, there is a large difference\r\n\r\nbetween  a  growth  rate  of  2.5%,  and  that  of  4.5%.   This\r\n\r\ndifference  in growth rates could be translated into significant\r\n\r\ndifferences  in retrenchments, in bankruptcies and  in  economic\r\n\r\nhardship in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four main features of this year's Budget. First,\r\n\r\nit  is a conservative budget aimed at achieving a small surplus.\r\n\r\nSecond,  there  are  no  major tax cuts.   Third,  there  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease in development expenditure.  And fourth, there are  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  to  promote the development of specific  industries,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the finance sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the budget surplus should be reduced during a\r\n\r\nyear of projected economic slowdown.  This is in part due to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in development expenditure from 6.3%  of  GDP  in\r\n\r\nfiscal  year 1997 to 7.5% in fiscal year 1998, which is entirely\r\n\r\nappropriate  at  this time, for three reasons: to  continue  our\r\n\r\nefforts   in   improving  our  medium  to   long-term   economic\r\n\r\ncapabilities; to take advantage of cheaper prices, for  example,\r\n\r\nin  land  reclamation; and in light of the expected slowdown  in\r\n\r\nprivate fixed capital formation, to boost investment expenditure\r\n\r\nby  means  of  public  sector capital  formation.   The  current\r\n\r\nemphasis now is to further develop the financial sector, without\r\n\r\nat  the same time reducing the importance of manufacturing,  and\r\n\r\nthe  fiscal  incentives  offered for  such  activities  as  fund\r\n\r\nmanagement are in line with this strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most significant aspect of the Budget is that\r\n\r\nthere are no major tax cuts to stimulate the sagging economy and\r\n\r\nto  help  businesses.   The  business  community  has  expressed\r\n\r\ndisappointment regarding this, particularly since  the  recently\r\n\r\nannounced  Hong Kong budget contained a wide range of tax  cuts,\r\n\r\nincluding  a  reduction  in the corporate  income  tax  rate,  a\r\n\r\nfreezing  of  most government fees, a reduction in property  tax\r\n\r\nand  in stamp duty on share transactions.  And all this when the\r\n\r\nforecast for the Hong Kong economy is 3.5%, which is exactly  in\r\n\r\nthe middle of the range forecasted for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that there is no need for major tax cuts, but\r\n\r\nprovided  growth  is within the upper half of  the  range.   If,\r\n\r\nindeed,  the  growth rate this year is about 4% or even  higher,\r\n\r\nthen  a reduced, small budget surplus with no major tax cuts  is\r\n\r\nentirely  appropriate.  A 4% growth rate  will  mean  that  some\r\n\r\ncompanies will be forced to downsize, retrench, merge  or  adopt\r\n\r\ndrastic  consolidation measures.  But that is part of commercial\r\n\r\nrisk.   There  are upsides and there are downsides in  business.\r\n\r\nBusinesses  experienced a very good bull run  since  1987.   And\r\n\r\nthese  two  years  -  1998, maybe 1999 -  can  be  viewed  as  a\r\n\r\nconsolidation  phase  after  10  years  of  uninterrupted  solid\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the growth rate for the economy is heading\r\n\r\ntowards 2.5% or lower, then I do believe that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment should adopt more measures to stimulate the  economy.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, the Budget can remain as it is.  But  where  I\r\n\r\ndiffer  with the Government is the threshold for the  activation\r\n\r\nof  off-Budget measures to stimulate the economy.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance seems to imply that major stimulus initiatives will\r\n\r\nonly  be  contemplated if there is an actual  recession,  ie,  a\r\n\r\ndecline  to  negative  growth.   I  would  argue  for  a  higher\r\n\r\nthreshold.   In other words, a positive but low growth  rate  of\r\n\r\n2.5%  or  below should be sufficient to implement  further  off-Budget measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons for doing so. First, I do not see\r\n\r\nthe  need  to go through a 2.5%, or even a 2% growth this  year,\r\n\r\nbecause it would be due largely to the contagion effect  of  the\r\n\r\nAsian  financial  crisis,  and not  to  weaknesses  in  our  own\r\n\r\ndomestic economic fundamentals.  Yes, I agree, and I quote, that\r\n\r\n\"our  tax rates remain competitive and no major tax changes will\r\n\r\nbe  made  against a background of declining revenue  collections\r\n\r\nand   rising  development  expenditures.\"   But  no  amount   of\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness in tax rates and rising development expenditures\r\n\r\ncan solve the immediate business problems of high interest rates\r\n\r\nand  low  demand, and possibly, the inability to  collect  trade\r\n\r\ncredit  from neighbouring countries; and because businesses  are\r\n\r\nin trouble, employees get retrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Minister has further stated that it is\r\n\r\nimportant to have a budget surplus in order to continue building\r\n\r\nour  financial reserves.  I totally agree with this  philosophy.\r\n\r\nBut I see no harm in further reducing the surplus this year,  in\r\n\r\norder  to  bolster the economy.  To put things  in  perspective.\r\n\r\nThe  estimated revenue loss of the 5% income tax rebate is  $130\r\n\r\nmillion.  The revenue loss from the 15% property tax rebate  for\r\n\r\ncommercial  and industrial properties is estimated  to  be  $145\r\n\r\nmillion.   Suppose  these rebates were to be doubled,  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, you have a further 5% income tax rebate and a further 15%\r\n\r\nproperty tax rebate.  The additional revenue loss would be  less\r\n\r\nthan $300 million.  The estimated budget surplus is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$2.68  billion.   In short, as the Minister has  said,  we  have\r\n\r\nenough resources to activate further off-Budget measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The off-Budget measures that the Government could adopt to\r\n\r\nstimulate  the economy and help businesses include: a  corporate\r\n\r\ntax rebate, a further individual income tax rebate, the granting\r\n\r\nof further concessions in property tax, for example, in the form\r\n\r\nof  rebates, reduction of stamp duty, or a rebate, for  property\r\n\r\npurchases  and  share  transactions.   Needless  to   say,   the\r\n\r\nmagnitude of the cost-cutting off-Budget measures will depend on\r\n\r\nthe severity of the downturn.  The more severe the downturn, the\r\n\r\ngreater the cost-cutting measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another aspect to consider, and that is, when\r\n\r\nwould   these   off-Budget  measures  occur?   Would   they   be\r\n\r\nimplemented  fast enough?  Or would it be a case of too  little,\r\n\r\ntoo  late?  The Minister has stated that \"the situation will  be\r\n\r\nclosely  monitored.\"  This is of utmost importance in  the  next\r\n\r\nfew  months.  Mr Inderjit Singh has alluded to a perception  gap\r\n\r\nbetween the Government's forecast on the one hand, and the views\r\n\r\nin  the business community on the other.  By the time the  first\r\n\r\nquarter  economic results come out, it could well be  too  late.\r\n\r\nThe  Department of Statistics might need to work doubly hard  to\r\n\r\nchurn  out  monthly  statistics fast enough in  order  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  keep track of the pulse  of  the  economy.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to  hard  statistical  data,  extensive  and  frequent\r\n\r\nconsultations with various sectors of the business community are\r\n\r\nin  order,  so  that  the  Government  is  ready  to  act,  when\r\n\r\nnecessary.  Let us not be caught flat-footed again, as  we  were\r\n\r\nin 1985.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of whether off-Budget measures are implemented\r\n\r\nor  not, the Government should implement an immediate freeze  on\r\n\r\npublic sector cost increases.  Government rates and fees are one\r\n\r\nimportant  component of business costs.  Consider, for  example,\r\n\r\nthe unit business cost index of manufacturing.  It is noteworthy\r\n\r\nthat  of  its three components (unit labour cost, services  cost\r\n\r\nand  Government rates and fees), it is the Government rates  and\r\n\r\nfees component which has increased the fastest since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1988.   While  the  unit  business cost index  as  a  whole  has\r\n\r\nincreased  by  26%,  Government rates and  fees,  which  include\r\n\r\nproperty tax payments, increased by 93%, or nearly doubled since\r\n\r\n1988.   While  businesses are all scrambling to cut  costs  this\r\n\r\nyear, Government charges should not contribute to costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In as much as wages still constitute a major portion of\r\n\r\ndomestic  cost,  the NWC recommendations this year  become  even\r\n\r\nmore  important in cost determination.  The decision  to  freeze\r\n\r\nthe  salaries  of  Ministers  and  top  civil  servants  was   a\r\n\r\nsignificant gesture in this regard, both politically  and  as  a\r\n\r\nsignal for caution and restraint in wage increases this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's estimated budget invariably errs on the\r\n\r\nconservative side.  In other words, except for 1996, the  actual\r\n\r\nbudget surplus, since the new system of accounting was published\r\n\r\nfrom  1990,  has been larger than the estimated budget  surplus.\r\n\r\nIn  today's  context, this is not a welcome trend.  The  economy\r\n\r\ndoes not need any additional fiscal contraction from larger-than-anticipated budget surpluses.  I would urge the Government to be\r\n\r\nmore  accurate in its budgeting this year.  If the economy grows\r\n\r\nfaster  than  anticipated  in the budget  planning  and  revenue\r\n\r\nincreases,  then the Government should correspondingly  increase\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   Otherwise, actual budget surplus  could  well  be\r\n\r\n2.5% or even 3%, well above the estimated surplus of 1.7% simply\r\n\r\nbecause  of  budgeting inaccuracy.  It has occurred since  1990,\r\n\r\nexcept  for the year 1996, and I would urge the Government  that\r\n\r\nit does not happen for this particular year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is that one of the major lessons that we can\r\n\r\nlearn  from  this slowdown is the need to develop resilience  in\r\n\r\nthe face of international economic shocks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current slowdown is a painful reminder that there is no\r\n\r\nguarantee  of  economic growth in any economic  system,  whether\r\n\r\ncapitalist  or  planned.  The global economy  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nexhibit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncycles  of  booms and recessions.  It will also occasionally  be\r\n\r\nsubject to shocks, which by definition are unanticipated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy has experienced an economic slowdown\r\n\r\nonly  twice since independence - in 1975, where growth was 4.1%,\r\n\r\nand in 1985, with a growth rate of  -1.6%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world recession which began in 1974 worsened in the\r\n\r\nfirst  half  of 1975.  The OECD growth rate for 1975  was  -2\ufffd%.\r\n\r\nWorld  trade  in  real terms declined by 12% in  1975,  and  the\r\n\r\nvolume of imports by OECD countries fell by 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet in spite of the world recession, the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  grew  by  4.1%.   This was in large  part  due  to  the\r\n\r\ndiversification of the economy.  While manufacturing declined by\r\n\r\n2%,  the services sectors, in particular, transport, storage and\r\n\r\ncommunication;   and  finance  and  business  services   sector,\r\n\r\nprovided 88% of the growth in GDP in 1975.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in this current economic slowdown, it is\r\n\r\nexpected that those sectors with final output destined  for  the\r\n\r\nUS  and  Europe,  namely, manufacturing will  fare  better  than\r\n\r\nsectors which are regionally-oriented, namely, services such  as\r\n\r\ntourism,  retail and healthcare.  The lesson we learn from  this\r\n\r\ncomparison  is the importance of diversification,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nsectors   and  markets.   Just  like  an  investor,   an   undue\r\n\r\nconcentration in any one sector or market could cause us  to  be\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to upturns and downturns in that sector  or  market.\r\n\r\nIn  this context, I am happy to note that the Minister for Trade\r\n\r\nand  Industry has announced that we would continue to  emphasise\r\n\r\nthe continued development of both manufacturing and services  as\r\n\r\ntwin  engines of growth.  Within each sector, there should  also\r\n\r\nbe  sufficient diversification in terms of industries and export\r\n\r\nmarkets in order to develop resilience in our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985, the world economy grew by 3% as did the growth in\r\n\r\nworld  trade.  The US economy slowed down compared to 1984,  but\r\n\r\nstill  grew  by  2.4%.  In other words, in  1985,  the  external\r\n\r\nenvironment  was  not  unfavourable.   But  in  spite  of  that,\r\n\r\nSingapore suffered a recession.  One main\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason  was  because  of the 43% increase in  unit  labour  cost\r\n\r\nduring  1980-1984  which  caused an erosion  of  competitiveness\r\n\r\ndomestically  and  this  coincided with the  slump  in  external\r\n\r\ndemand  in  the  key  oil  and  marine-related  industries.   In\r\n\r\naddition, fiscal policies had a contractionary effect, and there\r\n\r\nwas a slump in the property market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson we learn from the 1985 recession is the\r\n\r\nimportance of sustaining domestic competitiveness.  The 43% rise\r\n\r\nin  unit  labour  cost in 1980-1984 was one major  factor  which\r\n\r\ntipped  the scales and caused the recession instead  of  a  mere\r\n\r\nslowdown as occurred in 1975.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the recipe for developing resilience is sustained\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness combined with diversification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, while I agree with the main thrust of the\r\n\r\nBudget,  I hope that the Government will indeed not hesitate  to\r\n\r\nrespond  with  off-Budget measures if the need arises.   I  also\r\n\r\nhope  that the Government will not consider 2.5% growth too high\r\n\r\nto  activate such off-Budget measures.  There is no need for  us\r\n\r\nto suffer unnecessarily this time around.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget emphasises on education and our educational\r\n\r\nsystem is moving towards creative thinking and creativity.

Actually,  on\r\n\r\ntop  of  that,  he (EDB Chairman)  mentioned two  other  points.\r\n\r\nSince this subject has cropped up, I should mention that when he\r\n\r\nshowed me the statement, he threatened that my name would be put\r\n\r\ninto  the  statement  because  I  supported  those  three  named\r\n\r\nscholars  by speaking publicly against the issue.  My  name  was\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be  included in the statement.  He also  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  I  should send my speech (the speech which I made on  12th\r\n\r\nOctober  1997) to him for vetting.  I want to assure Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  that in all my years as a Member of Parliament,  no\r\n\r\nMinister or office-holder has ever asked me for my speech before\r\n\r\nI speak on any subject.

I think we should confine our debate to the Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  and at other times, raise a motion to have  it  fully\r\n\r\ndebated  as to whether or not we should publicise the  names  of\r\n\r\nthe  bond-breakers.

With 45 MPs\r\n\r\nsqueezing  into two days and if we just divide by the number  of\r\n\r\nhours  that we have, I think each MP will have very little  time\r\n\r\nto  speak.

But  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest to Dr Tan that he should confine it as much as  he\r\n\r\ncan  within  the  context  of  the financial  statement  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  Dr Tan, you may proceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I think\r\n\r\nthis subject is important because we are allocating funds to the\r\n\r\nvarious   Ministries   and   organisations,   and   of   course,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would like to know the funds we allocate  to  these\r\n\r\norganisations.   They  must also be accountable  to  this  House\r\n\r\nwhether in terms of their financial performance or the way  they\r\n\r\nhandle matters, and I still strongly believe that I have a right\r\n\r\nto speak on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, as an elected Member of this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I  cannot be a bystander when my Parliamentary colleague\r\n\r\nis  insulted in this manner.  I cannot allow the episode to pass\r\n\r\nby  without  expressing my concern.  I suppose my  Parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues would have done likewise.  We are the representatives\r\n\r\nof the people.  We are here in this House to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nair  the  views and concerns of the people.  Many of us in  this\r\n\r\nHouse have spoken strongly against the Government policies.   We\r\n\r\nwere reprimanded by the Ministers and we were taken to task even\r\n\r\nby  the Prime Minister, but we are still not embarrassed because\r\n\r\nwe  have spoken out honestly and frankly what we believe in  and\r\n\r\nalso  to  let the Government know how the people at  the  ground\r\n\r\nfeel.  Despite our differences in views, we were never asked  by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister to resign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, my Parliamentary colleague was offering a\r\n\r\nview  that was different from the EDB Chief and because of this,\r\n\r\nhe was asked to resign.  His reasons are: (1) he is a Government\r\n\r\nMP; and (2) naming bond-breakers is a Government policy.  Let me\r\n\r\nstate  my stand on bond-breaking.  I think it is not gentlemanly\r\n\r\nand should be discouraged, but not by naming them in public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to continue because I have to paint\r\n\r\nthe  picture to this House why this subject is important.  After\r\n\r\nhe  asked Chng Hee Kok to resign, he stormed out of the meeting.\r\n\r\nShould  a  man  of his standing do such a thing  to  an  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentative who refused to agree with his views?   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  our  Prime  Minister has ever done that.   It  is  not  a\r\n\r\ngentleman's  behaviour.  We want to build a more  civil  society\r\n\r\nand we must behave like one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add insult to injury, he wants Chng Hee Kok to let him\r\n\r\nknow  the names of those MPs who share Chng Hee Kok's views  and\r\n\r\nhe  does this by way of a letter, signed not by him but  by  his\r\n\r\nHead  of Human Resource Division, a Mr Timothy Sebastian, asking\r\n\r\nthese  MPs  to meet and discuss with him.  Since he has  already\r\n\r\nconcluded  that  those who disagree should resign,  there  would\r\n\r\nhave  been no civilised discussion.  And I presume the MPs  will\r\n\r\nbe  told  off, similarly, the way he told Chng Hee Kok, and  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  their resignation will be asked.  Let me  read  the\r\n\r\nletter that was faxed to me by Chng Hee Kok:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dear Mr Chng,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your meeting on the 19th January 1998 with our Chairman Mr\r\n\r\nPhilip  Yeo  refers.  During the meeting, the issue of  scholars\r\n\r\nterminating  their  scholarships was  discussed.   It  was  also\r\n\r\nmentioned that there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  MPs  who have differing views from our Chairman  on  this\r\n\r\nissue.   Our Chairman would like to meet with these MPs to  hear\r\n\r\ntheir  views and further discuss the issue with them.   In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  we would appreciate if you could let  us  have  the\r\n\r\nnames  and contact details of the relevant MPs so that a meeting\r\n\r\ncan be arranged.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, has he the right to summon MPs for a\r\n\r\nmeeting  to answer to him why they disagree?  Is he getting  too\r\n\r\nbig  for  his  shoes?  And this is not the  first  time  he  has\r\n\r\ndisplayed such an attitude towards elected leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I discussed this with my Members of\r\n\r\nParliament,  I was shown a copy of a newsletter called  Pioneers\r\n\r\nof  Computing  where he was featured as IT  champion.   In  this\r\n\r\ninterview, he had expressed views contrary to Government policy.\r\n\r\nFor example, he questions Government upgrading of our HDB flats.\r\n\r\nHe is quoted as saying, and I quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We spend millions of dollars renovating HDB apartments for\r\n\r\npeople.  What for?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he disagreed with this major Government policy.\r\n\r\nNo  one  asked  him to resign.  Yet, he wants Chng  Hee  Kok  to\r\n\r\nresign and other MPs to also resign.  On what matter, on a minor\r\n\r\nissue - a departmental issue on bond-breaking.  He obviously has\r\n\r\nhis own views as to who should lead Singapore.  I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When we were a young country in the 1960s, we were\r\n\r\ncreators, Lee Kuan Yew, Howe Yoon Chong [referring to all in the\r\n\r\nfrontbench]. Now, we have the era of the CFOs.  [I will  explain\r\n\r\nwhat  \"CFO\" stands for.]  This is where Singapore is right  now.\r\n\r\nNow we have to see if we go up or down.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must get rid of these people. These people should\r\n\r\nnever be allowed to be No. 1, because they are not creators.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you judge for yourself. Is this not a\r\n\r\nreference  to the present leadership, as no more than uncreative\r\n\r\nCFOs,  which stands for chief financial officers?   Earlier,  in\r\n\r\nhis  interview,  he  equates CFOs as  bean  counters.   Are  our\r\n\r\nMinisters bean counters?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the naming of bond breakers a Government policy? No, it\r\n\r\ncannot  be.   It is a departmental policy.  As Members  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse must have read in the papers that even PSC, the body  that\r\n\r\nawards  prestigious scholarships, is not naming the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscholars.  Therefore, he is not being fair to Mr Chng  Hee  Kok,\r\n\r\nand  was  hiding behind the Government to push his own view  and\r\n\r\nbelief.   He  then has the audacity to ask Mr Chng  Hee  Kok  to\r\n\r\nresign as an elected MP and, as I said, on what issue?  A  minor\r\n\r\nissue, a different approach to management of bond breakers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok's electorate, those who voted him in, will\r\n\r\nbe  wondering  why they  have to lose their MP.  Maybe  the  EDB\r\n\r\nchief  should  go to Mr Chng's constituency and explain  to  the\r\n\r\nconstituents why their MP should go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked of a lack of leaders with creativity in his\r\n\r\ninterview with Pioneer IT.  I think Members must read this.   It\r\n\r\nis  a  very   important  paper and  I  will  ask  the  Clerk  of\r\n\r\nParliament to circulate this later on.  And I quote him:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They are preoccupied with auditing, counting, making sure\r\n\r\nthat  every  chair and table is there.  They are so  preoccupied\r\n\r\nwith  the material part, they forget that the most important  is\r\n\r\nthe creative part, the people.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all that is well said, but you ask\r\n\r\nyourself: how to be creative when the leader of a company has no\r\n\r\nroom  for differing views?  All this talk of creativity in  that\r\n\r\ninterview is just lip service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a serious matter, because I see his action as\r\n\r\nan  affront to the office of the elected Members of this  House,\r\n\r\nby  a  member  of the Administrative Service.   May  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister what he intends to do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the budget. I am very impressed by the\r\n\r\nNominated  Member's discussion on the budget.  She  did  a  very\r\n\r\ngood  job.

There is strong  confidence\r\n\r\nin Singapore's banking system and the viability of the financial\r\n\r\nservices  industry.  Even then, we are not spared from  the  ill\r\n\r\neffects of the meltdown in the  regional economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international financial community is a very important\r\n\r\nconstituency.   Our  Government recognises  this  and  tries  to\r\n\r\naddress the issues and concerns of the foreign fund managers and\r\n\r\nforeign  players  in  the international capital  markets.   Some\r\n\r\nregional  countries have blamed their sad state  of  affairs  on\r\n\r\n\"international  conspiracy\"  of the  currency  speculators  that\r\n\r\nstarted  and fuelled the currency crisis.  If indeed  there  are\r\n\r\nareas  that  foreigners  can create  problems  on  the  domestic\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  have to be careful that the rights of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  decide their own destiny are not jeopardised.  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nalready  a  very  open economy.  Foreigners are  already  owning\r\n\r\nassets and shares in Singapore.  These foreigners will next want\r\n\r\nto  seek  control over \"blue chip\" Singapore banks and companies\r\n\r\nwhich  are  strategic  to our national interest.   We  ought  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  foreigners do not take over  control  of  key\r\n\r\nsectors  of our economy which pose dangers and security risk  to\r\n\r\nour country.  We should continue to open our economy so long  as\r\n\r\nthere  are  benefits to be obtained from as diverse a  group  of\r\n\r\nforeign investors as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has taken active steps to support our neighbours.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  to help restore confidence and bring the economies  of\r\n\r\nour  neighbours  back to an even keel.  We have  not  been  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful  so  far because of domestic circumstances,  but  the\r\n\r\nmessage  and signals from Singapore have been clear.   Singapore\r\n\r\nwants to be helpful during this period of currency turmoil.  Our\r\n\r\nnational  interest  and  prosperity  is  tied  to  that  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours.

A  stable\r\n\r\nand prosperous ASEAN is indeed beneficial to all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main thrust of this year's budget is to prepare\r\n\r\nSingaporeans for the tough years ahead but, more importantly, to\r\n\r\nprepare  ourselves  for  the  recovery  that  will  come,   with\r\n\r\nSingapore emerging even stronger than we did in the aftermath of\r\n\r\nthe  1985 recession.  How long this economic slowdown will take,\r\n\r\nno  one can predict because of the volatility and uncertainty of\r\n\r\nthe  situation.  One thing is certain: the recovery  will  come.\r\n\r\nWhat  is needed is for us to continue with the prudent long-term\r\n\r\npolicies.  Singapore, under the PAP Government, has consistently\r\n\r\npursued sound policies with strong fundamentals that provide for\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  good of our people.  We are prepared  and  stand\r\n\r\nready for difficult times ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has once again placed top priority in\r\n\r\neducation.   The hefty 30% increase provided for expenditure  on\r\n\r\neducation is very significant as it constitutes 3.6% of GDP  and\r\n\r\none-fifth  of  total Government expenditure.  The investment  in\r\n\r\neducation  has  always been proved to be worthwhile.   The  high\r\n\r\nstandards  of  education given to our young  has  paid  handsome\r\n\r\ndividends in the quality of our manpower.  Our well-educated and\r\n\r\nhard  working workforce has given Singapore the competitive edge\r\n\r\nand contributing to strong economic growth and development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government could have given working adults\r\n\r\nmore  financial  help  to encourage them  to  pursue  continuing\r\n\r\neducation  programmes.  In difficult times, many  employers  are\r\n\r\nnot   likely  to  provide  additional  funds  for  training  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment of their officers and staff.  Company training tends\r\n\r\nto  suffer during times of belt tightening and cost containment.\r\n\r\nAlso,  there  is likely to be more retrenchments this  year  and\r\n\r\nthose  who are out of work could go for further training  whilst\r\n\r\nlooking   for  alternative  employment.   Perhaps   the   Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund could review its policy to be more generous  in\r\n\r\nproviding  the  necessary help to employers and individuals  who\r\n\r\nseek to attend training\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourses to upgrade themselves and enhance their competencies  to\r\n\r\nremain employable and perform their jobs better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of economic slowdown, many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwould   be  losing  their  jobs  through  retrenchment   because\r\n\r\ncompanies   are   facing  financial  difficulties.    We   have,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  to be judicious and impose stringent standards  when\r\n\r\napproving the employment permits for foreigners who want to work\r\n\r\nand settle down in Singapore.  In fields where local talents are\r\n\r\nin  short  supply,  for example, in information  technology  and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications, there would be less repercussions.   But  it\r\n\r\nis still vague as to what constitutes \"talent\".  Should we allow\r\n\r\nthe  employers  only  to decide?  Are our bureaucrats  competent\r\n\r\nenough  to  assess the true foreign talent?  The Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission  scrutinises  all top talents  that  join  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.   Is there not a need for an independent panel  set  up\r\n\r\nunder  the  Ministry  of  Manpower to ensure  that  the  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  employed  in the private sector are  indeed  assets  to\r\n\r\nSingapore?   We  want  to  be  fair  to  Singaporeans   in   the\r\n\r\ncompetition for suitable employment and that the foreign talents\r\n\r\nselected are indeed of very high quality for the long-term  good\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, HDB sold shops and hawker stalls to the\r\n\r\nsitting tenants.  In recent times, the businesses of these shops\r\n\r\nand   stallholders  have  been  adversely  affected.   With  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn  and  the decline  in  business,  the  higher\r\n\r\ninterest  rates  have made it difficult for some  businesses  to\r\n\r\nservice  the  loans from banks.  Is there any way in  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  help to alleviate the situation  of  affected\r\n\r\nowners  of HDB shops and hawker stalls?  Will HDB continue  with\r\n\r\nits sale of shops programme in the new areas?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the macro level, the general economic situation appears\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  However, at the individual firm level, there  are\r\n\r\nserious  challenges  and difficulties faced  by  our  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium-sized businesses.  The manufacturing and services sectors\r\n\r\nemploy  a  large number of workers and contribute a  substantial\r\n\r\namount to our GDP.

I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  timely  measures would be taken for if they  come  in  too\r\n\r\nlate,  many otherwise good businesses that we wish to help would\r\n\r\nhave gone asunder and would have become casualties.  We have  to\r\n\r\ntry  our  very best to save as many jobs as possible.   I  think\r\n\r\njobs will be important in the coming years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional economic crisis is certainly taking its toll\r\n\r\non  everybody.  We are facing a period of uncertainty.   Indeed,\r\n\r\nthis is so even to predict the economic outlook for Singapore in\r\n\r\nthe  months ahead.  It is therefore prudent for the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance in his Budget Statement to have said, \"we are keeping  a\r\n\r\ntight lid on operational expenditure\".  In this context, Sir, it\r\n\r\nis  a  good  opportunity  for  us to  redouble  our  efforts  at\r\n\r\nefficiency and economy.  I would like to draw attention to  this\r\n\r\nin  terms of healthcare cost in the future and the need for  its\r\n\r\ncontainment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continual escalation of healthcare cost, real or\r\n\r\napparent,  is of much concern to most Singaporeans  today.  And,\r\n\r\nalthough our country has not faced excessive hikes in healthcare\r\n\r\ncost,  as  in  the United States, for instance, we  need  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for  cost-related problems to contend with.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  so  in  terms of secondary-level and  tertiary-level\r\n\r\nhealthcare requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is as good a time as any to review our system and\r\n\r\nlook  for  ways to contain further rapid increases in healthcare\r\n\r\ncost  and to maintain the high-quality care we now have.   There\r\n\r\nis no simple solution.  We should be prepared to re-evaluate our\r\n\r\npresent  system  with a different mindset  and  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\ntackle  the  problems with new perspectives and  through  multi-approach ways.  What follows are some aspects in our system that\r\n\r\nmerit our immediate attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. There should not be plans for more new restructured\r\n\r\ngeneral  hospitals for a while yet; we certainly have sufficient\r\n\r\nof  them  now.   Building more new ones will only cause  further\r\n\r\nduplication of the various disciplines which frequently leads to\r\n\r\nwastage   of   resources.   Sir,  the  likes  of  our   existing\r\n\r\nrestructured general hospitals are both expensive to  build  and\r\n\r\nexpensive to run.  A small country like ours should not need any\r\n\r\nmore  of  them.   We  should, however, look into  building  more\r\n\r\ncommunity hospitals instead.  They will be cheaper to build  and\r\n\r\ndefinitely cheaper to run.  These hospitals will be much  needed\r\n\r\nto  treat  the  increasing numbers of elderly sick  who  usually\r\n\r\nrequire  longer  hospitalisation because of  chronic  illnesses.\r\n\r\nThese  community  hospitals will be  more  accessible  and  more\r\n\r\nsuited  to provide better and cheaper care to the chronic  sick.\r\n\r\nIf  we have sufficient beds to cater for these chronic sick,  we\r\n\r\nwill   not  waste  the  expensive  acute  beds  in  the  general\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. There should be enhanced collaboration amongst\r\n\r\nhealthcare  personnel  and  increased  cooperation  between  the\r\n\r\nvarious  restructured general hospitals.  This is important  for\r\n\r\nprevention of excessive duplication of under-utilised facilities\r\n\r\nand  personnel.  Wastage of resources in terms of equipment  and\r\n\r\nof  doctors and other personnel becomes significant when we have\r\n\r\nmultiple  centres for each and every speciality  or  discipline.\r\n\r\nThe  problem  of  finding medical staff to run all  the  general\r\n\r\nhospitals,  especially when we are continually facing  shortages\r\n\r\nof  trained manpower, can become insurmountable.  The fact  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  just  not  enough  case  material  in  some  of   the\r\n\r\nspecialities  or  disciplines  to  go  round  at  any  one  time\r\n\r\ncompounds  the  problems.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  competition  for\r\n\r\nexcellence is desirable, but \"fighting\" for patient-load is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We should look for more practical and prudent ways to\r\n\r\nintegrate  and  tap  all  sectors of  our  available  healthcare\r\n\r\nfacilities.   We should induce the primary level care  providers\r\n\r\nto  cater  for  the increasing numbers of the elderly  and   the\r\n\r\nchronic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsick.  Perhaps they can work more closely with the hospitals  in\r\n\r\nshare-care  schemes  and  remunerated by  the  Government  in  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  and controlled manner to ensure affordability.   The\r\n\r\nadvantages from such schemes would be the significant savings on\r\n\r\ncost,  the decreased demands on the hospitals in terms  of  beds\r\n\r\nand  medical staff,  but more importantly, the positive  effects\r\n\r\nof  having  patients continuing to stay in their own homes  with\r\n\r\ntheir  loved  ones.   Thus,  some sort  of  managed-care  scheme\r\n\r\nbetween the general practitioners and the Government may be  the\r\n\r\nway to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Preventive medicine as the key to maintaining good\r\n\r\nhealth  in  any  population  cannot be  over-emphasised.   This,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  is  one  area  we can ill-afford  to  cut  back  on.\r\n\r\nInstead,  we  must  seek out all avenues  to  help  the  healthy\r\n\r\nmaintain their well-being for as long as possible.  In the  long\r\n\r\nrun, it will be the ministry of continuous and concerted efforts\r\n\r\nin   promoting  preventive  medicine  that  would  contain   the\r\n\r\nescalating  cost  of  healthcare.   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is\r\n\r\nespecially so when there are increasing numbers of elderly folk.\r\n\r\nNow,  for this group of citizens, I would like to again  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  for the best results, \"preventive care\" should be  started\r\n\r\nas soon as possible and through centres utilising a \"total-care\"\r\n\r\nconcept.  In other words, these  Centres of Activity for Retired\r\n\r\nand Elderly (CARE) should cater for the physical, the mental  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the social well-being of each elderly.  For the general\r\n\r\npopulation, I would like to suggest that we increase mass public\r\n\r\neducation  on preventive healthcare and enable easier access  to\r\n\r\nregular  health  screening tests. We have to reach  out  to  the\r\n\r\npeople and increase their awareness for this need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The attitude and the mindset of our people in relation\r\n\r\nto  affordable healthcare in Singapore has to be reviewed in the\r\n\r\nlight  of our increasing affluence and expectations.  And, if we\r\n\r\nhave  to  address the need for change in order to  cope  with  a\r\n\r\nlitigious public, it is likely that affordable healthcare may be\r\n\r\njeopardised.   When doctors and other healthcare  providers  are\r\n\r\ngiven to over-investigating and to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover-treating  the patients because of pressures  from  patients\r\n\r\nand  because  of  fear  from litigation,  healthcare  cost  must\r\n\r\nincrease  and  affordable healthcare, as we  know  it,  will  be\r\n\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that we are very fortunate here in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe have the means to afford a world-class healthcare service for\r\n\r\nour people.  Indeed, we do have an abundance of what the medical\r\n\r\nworld  can  offer  and  we  do  have  some  very  good  hospital\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Let us make sure we get the mileage from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the annual Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, this year, the\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus has shrunk to about $2.7 billion,  showing  that\r\n\r\nbusiness  shall be bad again this year.  Last year, all  sectors\r\n\r\nshowed  a  decline,  the  stock market plummeted,  the  finance,\r\n\r\nproperty,  tourism, manufacturing, retail sectors, all declined.\r\n\r\nDespite  the  poor business showing, the Government  refused  to\r\n\r\nlower  corporate  tax by one or two percentage  points.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  corporate tax is about 26%.  Businessmen  expected\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to reduce the corporate tax  by  at  least  one\r\n\r\npercentage point to 25%.  But that expectation was not met.  The\r\n\r\nexcuse  given by the Government was that it already had  reduced\r\n\r\nthe tax low enough and that if the corporate tax were reduced to\r\n\r\n25%,  Singapore shall be deemed to be a tax haven.  I say  these\r\n\r\nare  all  lame  excuses.  I think the true reason  is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is waiting for the 5-year moratorium for  the  Goods\r\n\r\nand Services Tax at 3% to expire next year, and then we will see\r\n\r\nthe  reduction of corporate tax.  But, of course, we  expect  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the GST from next year onwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the shrinkage of the budget surplus, the Government\r\n\r\nshall  have less money to be transferred to the Edusave  account\r\n\r\nand  to  Medifund.  I hope with this transfer of less  money  to\r\n\r\nthese   two   funds,  the  Government  shall   not   hold   back\r\n\r\ndisbursements on these funds, especially to needy pupils and the\r\n\r\npeople who need them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can remember that in 1984-85, the opposition were\r\n\r\ncalling for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployees'  CPF contributions to be reduced so that  they  could\r\n\r\nhave  a  bigger take-home pay.  But at that time the  Government\r\n\r\nasserted  that the CPF contributions are sacrosanct.   They  are\r\n\r\nthe  workers' salary.   They belong to the workers.  They cannot\r\n\r\nbe  cut.  But when the economy went really bad, to a minus  1.6%\r\n\r\ngrowth,  the  Government went back on its word and  allowed  the\r\n\r\nemployers'  component of the CPF to be reduced  by  a  hefty  15\r\n\r\npercentage points, from 25% to 10%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with such a precedent, I believe that workers are\r\n\r\nworried today.  Despite the fact that flexi-wage system has been\r\n\r\nintroduced,  they  are still worried that the  Government  shall\r\n\r\nallow  the  CPF rate again to be slashed downwards.   Doubtless,\r\n\r\nshould  the CPF rate be reduced again, the workers shall  suffer\r\n\r\ngreater  hardship this round because HDB flat prices have  risen\r\n\r\nmuch higher than those in the 1985-87 period.  The financing  of\r\n\r\nthese flats is higher today and HDB flat purchasers have to  pay\r\n\r\nmuch higher monthly loan instalments.  I urge the Government  to\r\n\r\ndo everything possible and prevent the recurrence of another CPF\r\n\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another aspect of the CPF is that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  allow retrenched workers to draw on their  own  CPF.   I\r\n\r\nremember  that  in the 1985-87 recession, the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTampines  GRC,  Mr  Yatiman Yusof, called on the  Government  to\r\n\r\nallow  a  retrenched worker to withdraw $200 per month from  his\r\n\r\nCPF  account.   I  would now suggest that the  Government  allow\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers to draw up to $300 per month  from  his  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings subject to, of course, the amount of CPF he has  in  his\r\n\r\naccount.    The  Government  should  look  into  this   proposal\r\n\r\nseriously  because  the  number  of  retrenched  workers   shall\r\n\r\nincrease.  The expected number of workers retrenched  is  to  be\r\n\r\nabout 15,000 workers and some expect this number to increase  to\r\n\r\nas high as the 1985-87 level of 20,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, a survey recently carried out by two international\r\n\r\nconsultancy firms showed that 62% of our workers' savings cannot\r\n\r\nlast  them more than three months should they be out of  a  job.\r\n\r\nAnother 22%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  workers interviewed said that their savings could  last\r\n\r\nonly  up  to six months.  The survey also revealed that most  of\r\n\r\nthese  workers have low education and they are employed as blue-collar workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of these workers are also not young. There is\r\n\r\nmerit for the Government to allow CPF savings to be drawn out by\r\n\r\nretrenched workers, especially if there are sufficient funds  in\r\n\r\ntheir CPF accounts.  After all, it is the workers' own money and\r\n\r\nthey should be allowed to use it when they are out of a job  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  unable to find alternative employment  or  they  have\r\n\r\ndependants to support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been announced that the Government is not going to\r\n\r\nfully keep its election promise to upgrade HDB flats since there\r\n\r\nis  going to be a downturn in the economy.  The upgrading of HDB\r\n\r\nflats programme is going to be slashed down this year from 15 to\r\n\r\n10  precincts.   The question is: should the economy  get  worse\r\n\r\nnext  year, is the Government going to further cut down  on  the\r\n\r\nHDB  upgrading programme?  I would think so.  We have  seen  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  going back on its promise before.   The  problem  is\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  last  election, the Government thought  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy  shall  be  forever  on  the  upward   trend,\r\n\r\naccumulating  surpluses year after year, more  than  $5  billion\r\n\r\neach year.  Under such an illusion, it promised voters that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment shall carry out upgrading of their flats should  they\r\n\r\nsupport the Government policies, ie, in plain language, vote the\r\n\r\nPAP.    Well,  they  have  voted the PAP and  returned  all  PAP\r\n\r\ncandidates to Parliament except two.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens now? One-third of the voters may have to wait\r\n\r\na very long time for their flats to be upgraded.  The Government\r\n\r\ntells  them  now,  \"The economy is bad.  We do not  have  enough\r\n\r\nfunds.\"  What is surprising is that the Government does not have\r\n\r\nenough funds in its coffers, yet it made a bold election promise\r\n\r\nto  the  people.   Indeed, the Finance Minister  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  does not think that the upgrading of HDB flats  is  a\r\n\r\npriority.  The Budget does make special\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovision  for education, defence, economic infrastructure  like\r\n\r\nthe  reclamation  of  land at Jurong island,  but  there  is  no\r\n\r\nmention at all of HDB flats to be upgraded on a priority  basis,\r\n\r\nalthough an election promise was made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the Budget also has not mentioned\r\n\r\nabout retraining of retrenched workers.  In fact, the Government\r\n\r\nonly  spends  money on pre-employment training  in  schools  and\r\n\r\nvocational  institutes.  The only source  of  funds  for  worker\r\n\r\nretraining  is  from  the  Skills Development  Fund,  which  are\r\n\r\ncontributed  by  employers.   The  Budget  this  year  has   not\r\n\r\nspecifically  put any money aside for retraining  of  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers.  This only shows how caring the Government is  for  the\r\n\r\nplight  of retrenched workers.  I know it is not right to pamper\r\n\r\nour   workers   unnecessarily.   But  in   times   of   economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties, the Government must show some compassion  to  take\r\n\r\ncare of our workers who are out of job and not rely entirely  on\r\n\r\nthe  business concerns to retrain our workers.  Business  people\r\n\r\nare never altruistic.  They are only profit-motivated.  As such,\r\n\r\nthey  may even take advantage of the economic downturn  and  use\r\n\r\nthe attract foreign talent policy to employ cheap foreign labour\r\n\r\nand  to  train them with skills so that they can take over  jobs\r\n\r\nfrom  Singaporeans.  In the end, many of the top-paying jobs  in\r\n\r\nour  workforce  may be taken over by foreigners  -  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere Singapore workers cannot accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income tax rebate this year is only 5% compared to the\r\n\r\nprevious  year's  when  10%  rebate  was  given.   Although  the\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax rate this year has not increased,  the  net\r\n\r\neffect  is that Singaporeans are paying more income tax  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that rebates have been sliced by one-half.   The  10%\r\n\r\nrebate  should  have  been  maintained  because  only  a   small\r\n\r\nproportion  of the population is carrying the bulk  of  the  tax\r\n\r\nburden.   Since there are no tax reliefs this year, the Minister\r\n\r\nshould maintain the 10% rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebates and grants given to HDB flat dwellers in the 1-room to 4-room flats should be increased by at least one-half.\r\n\r\nThe Government is spending $72 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  these  grants and rebates, which is only about 2.7%  of  the\r\n\r\nexpected accumulated surplus.  The Government should double this\r\n\r\nspending  because,  firstly, many of the HDB  flat  dwellers  or\r\n\r\nmembers  of  their families may be retrenched.  Secondly,  these\r\n\r\ngrants  and  rebates  are  only  sufficient  to  cover  for  the\r\n\r\nincreased  charges  in S&C and the increase in  electricity  and\r\n\r\nwater  conservation rates.  The HDB flat dwellers at most  shall\r\n\r\nbe  put  in  a  neutral  position as regards  payments  for  the\r\n\r\nutilities and S&C charges.  They shall not gain by these  grants\r\n\r\nand  rebates.

The  pricing mechanism appears to  be  particularly\r\n\r\neffective in regulating demand and supply of goods and services,\r\n\r\nexcept  where there are monopolies, duopolies and cartels.   The\r\n\r\nprice  mechanism is, in fact, such an efficient tool  to  modify\r\n\r\nSingaporean  behaviour  that its wide  use  has  earned  us  the\r\n\r\ndubious  reputation of being a \"fine\" city.  Every  unacceptable\r\n\r\nsocial  behaviour has its price, from littering to  spitting  to\r\n\r\nsmoking in public places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For better or worse, monetary disincentives do hurt our\r\n\r\npockets   and  monetary  incentives  do  cheer  up  the  masses,\r\n\r\nespecially  in these increasingly hard times - and  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  responded accordingly.  So we jack up university  fees  in\r\n\r\narts  courses so that people will go into engineering;  Accident\r\n\r\nand Emergency clinic charges so that people with non-emergencies\r\n\r\nwill  turn  to  other  clinics;  and  increase  taxi  fares  and\r\n\r\nAdditional  Registration Fees so that people  who  do  buy  cars\r\n\r\nreally  do  so because they need to.  In this way, we curb  high\r\n\r\ndemand  for  limited  resources and  channel  demand  to  under-utilised  facilities  in the national interest  and  to  promote\r\n\r\nGovernment priorities, and I think that is a good thing.  In  so\r\n\r\ndoing,  however,  I believe we have become too trigger-happy  in\r\n\r\nusing  price  mechanisms.   It  has  become  the  Jack  of   all\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  Master of all civil servants.   Some  of  these\r\n\r\nincentives  are present in this year's Budget.  I  am,  however,\r\n\r\nnot  criticising  any  of them specifically,  but  I  am  merely\r\n\r\nraising a matter of broad principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monetary disincentives are painful but, I submit, not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  the  most effective measure to  deal  with  certain\r\n\r\nmatters, such as the overuse of services with inelastic demand - some  would say that would include A&E services - or to  channel\r\n\r\nuniversity students to do courses in which they have no aptitude\r\n\r\nnor  interest.  Policy makers should not just go for the easiest\r\n\r\nroute but should look to more creative, non-monetary options  if\r\n\r\nthey  wish  to modify Singaporean behaviour along the  lines  of\r\n\r\nwhat they have determined are good for the public at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money as a policy tool may often be effective but is always\r\n\r\nuncreative.   It can become the panacea and \"easy way  out\"  for\r\n\r\nall  sorts  of  things  that Government wants  to  encourage  or\r\n\r\ndiscourage.    In  so  doing,  we  invariably  create   a   very\r\n\r\nmaterialistic  and,  if  I might say so, uncouth  society  where\r\n\r\n\"only money talks\", because, in this case, the Government is the\r\n\r\nunchallenged leader\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  trend-setter.  Is that good ultimately for our society\r\n\r\nwhen we are all trying our level best to produce more volunteers\r\n\r\nand promote a more civic society?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money is too blunt a tool even if it is effective. We\r\n\r\nshould  perhaps  ban  all Government officials  from  suggesting\r\n\r\ndirect  fiscal solutions till they have proposed  at  least  two\r\n\r\nother  non-monetary options first.  If monetary  incentives  and\r\n\r\ndisincentives are indeed the only justifiable option, we  should\r\n\r\nrequire our officials and the Government to spend a little  more\r\n\r\ntime garnering public support and culling public feedback before\r\n\r\nthe  policy  is  cast  in stone.  This way, Government  is  more\r\n\r\nvisibly  accountable to the people and public  feedback  is  not\r\n\r\nseen as merely post-policy (or post-Budget) chipping away at the\r\n\r\npolicy's  edges.  There  will be no more  unthinking  resort  to\r\n\r\nmonetary  mechanism as a first, rather than as a  last,  option.\r\n\r\nSurely,  there  must be plenty of alternatives always  -  albeit\r\n\r\nthese alternatives may require patience, time, gentle persuasion\r\n\r\nand tedious education efforts.  I surfed the Internet discussion\r\n\r\ngroups,  for  example, during the A&E fees furore and  found  at\r\n\r\nleast  seven sensible non-monetary suggestions on resolving  the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if these methods are time-consuming to implement, we\r\n\r\nshould not totally discount them.  Not every policy needs to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  overnight and we can explore these options  slowly.\r\n\r\nWe  took  one year to persuade Singaporeans to accept  GST.   We\r\n\r\nhave  six months to educate them on the benefits of the ERP.   I\r\n\r\nknow  the Ministry of Communications has been working very  hard\r\n\r\nto  win support from the public and has been working behind  the\r\n\r\nscene  with  special  groups to justify and  fine-tune  the  ERP\r\n\r\nplans.   Like them, I hope other Ministries will not  stinge  on\r\n\r\nthe efforts to educate the public on their own future policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with increased A&E charges, it later appeared (as the\r\n\r\ndebate heated up last year) that the proposed increased fees  to\r\n\r\ndeter excessive use of A&E for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-emergency  cases  was  actually  justifiable   because   the\r\n\r\nincreases  were  lower than the costs that  the  hospitals  were\r\n\r\nincurring.  If that were so, why did not the Ministry take  them\r\n\r\nthrough to the public in the first place, painstakingly perhaps,\r\n\r\nso  as to win the hearts and minds of the public?  Why could not\r\n\r\nthey  do  it upfront rather than as a kind of afterthought?   We\r\n\r\nhave an increasingly educated and sophisticated electorate -  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  think  that all this explanation is  unproductive  or\r\n\r\nwasteful  or will indeed go over their heads.  Let us  all  have\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of knowing all the deep thinking and sound analysis\r\n\r\nthat  went into each Government policy and not just be  told  to\r\n\r\naccept   unquestioningly  the  eminent  conclusions  they   have\r\n\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us work together towards being a society that responds\r\n\r\nmore  caringly and sensitively to matters of Government  policy,\r\n\r\nrather  than to always turn to the over-ready financial  beating\r\n\r\nrod.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Budget Statement be proceeded with\r\n\r\nbeyond  4.30 pm and the proceedings thereon be exempted at  this\r\n\r\nday's  sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 until\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\nBudget  comes at a time of economic uncertainty.   It  is  clear\r\n\r\nthat Singapore will be affected by the regional downturn.  It is\r\n\r\nalso clear that the present downturn is unlike any other we have\r\n\r\nfaced, quite different and potentially deeper than what we  have\r\n\r\nseen  in  the mid-1980s.  What is less clear is the  extent  and\r\n\r\nduration of the downturn and the particular sectors that will be\r\n\r\nhardest   hit.   But  also  has  to  be  decided  which  sectors\r\n\r\nGovernment  will intervene to help and which it  will  leave  to\r\n\r\ntheir own means, for better or worse.  For those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsectors  where Government intervenes, the method and  extent  of\r\n\r\nintervention have also to be seen.  Against this background, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has set three priorities:  (1) to rally the  people;\r\n\r\n(2) to help resolve the regional crisis; and (3) to plan for the\r\n\r\nfuture,  so that Singapore will emerge from the crisis  stronger\r\n\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Budget seems to focus on (3) to plan for the\r\n\r\nfuture.  It gives a wide range of incentives for newer, emerging\r\n\r\nindustries that Government wishes to foster.  For other sectors,\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  gives  less relief than many had  hoped  for.   The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has emphasised that the Government believes\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  immediate need for bailouts and  that  off-Budget\r\n\r\nitems  would  be held in reserve if things turn for  the  worse.\r\n\r\nThis  seems a confident and prudent approach.  It is an approach\r\n\r\nthat,  however, postpones potentially harder economic  questions\r\n\r\nthat  this present economic crisis may yet require us to answer.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government holds other measures of help in reserve,  it\r\n\r\nremains  to be seen how well and how timely the Government  will\r\n\r\nread  the needs on the ground and shape its response.   What  we\r\n\r\nneed,  at  this  juncture, is a promise of close monitoring  and\r\n\r\nthat the Government would remain open to calls for assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present Budget, while the emphasis seems to be on\r\n\r\nincentives  rather than bailouts, as I have said, one  exception\r\n\r\nstands  out.  This is the measure to forgo property tax on  land\r\n\r\nunder  development.  This measure will cost the Government  some\r\n\r\n$200 million in revenues forgone.  This is a considerable amount\r\n\r\nto  assist one particular sector, property developers.  The last\r\n\r\ntime  this measure was taken was in the mid-1980 recession.   In\r\n\r\ncontrast,  Sir, measures to help other sectors, such  as  hotels\r\n\r\nand  retailers,  are scant, if not, non-existent.   Measures  to\r\n\r\nhelp the individual taxpayer with a 5% rebate, while useful, are\r\n\r\nnot  as  ample  as they were last year where a  10%  rebate  was\r\n\r\ngiven.  The present rebate seems even smaller when we compare it\r\n\r\nto the 25% given during the recession year of 1985.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we compare the assistance given to property developers\r\n\r\nwith  the  5%  rebate,  we must note that the  relatively  small\r\n\r\nnumber  of developers will receive some $200 million, as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  while all taxpayers will in total receive the lesser  sum\r\n\r\nof about $130 million from the rebate.  Two questions arise from\r\n\r\nthese  comparisons.  First, is it the Minister's view  that  the\r\n\r\nproperty  developers are in a situation akin to that  which  was\r\n\r\nwitnessed in the mid-1980s and, by comparison to the help  given\r\n\r\nto  them,  is  it the Government's view that other sectors  like\r\n\r\nhotels  and  retailers and individuals are not so badly  hit  at\r\n\r\npresent?  The second question is how much must other sectors and\r\n\r\nindividuals  be  affected before Government  will  assist  in  a\r\n\r\nlarger way?  What yardsticks will Government use to measure when\r\n\r\nit will be timely to bring in its reserved off-Budget assistance\r\n\r\ninto play?  In asking this, I note that the business sector  has\r\n\r\nperceptions that things are already bad.  Among some individuals\r\n\r\nI  also know there have been already reports of distressed sales\r\n\r\nof  property  and  even  some suicides apparently  triggered  by\r\n\r\neconomic  woes.   We  have  a reactive  Budget.   The  important\r\n\r\nquestion  is  that it should be clearer when the  threshold  for\r\n\r\nreaction will come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in bad times of uncertain growth, many will look to\r\n\r\nthe Government for assistance.  It is not of course that all who\r\n\r\nask  must  get what they ask for, not even Singapore's  reserves\r\n\r\nare  large enough for everyone's wish-list.  But in deciding who\r\n\r\nto  help,  when  and how much, there has to be a legitimate  and\r\n\r\nfair basis for decisions and just as important, transparency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have suggested that this Budget focuses on the third\r\n\r\npriority  to plan for the future so that Singapore would  emerge\r\n\r\nfrom  the  crisis stronger than before.  While I  agree  largely\r\n\r\nwith  this policy, I think it is also important that this Budget\r\n\r\ngives  equal  expression  to the first priority,  to  rally  the\r\n\r\npeople.   In  good times, many would be proud of  Singapore,  of\r\n\r\nbeing Singaporean.  The more severe test of this pride is during\r\n\r\nbad   times.   Will  the  people  rally?   Does  Singapore  have\r\n\r\nsufficient heartware to pass the test of bad times?  This  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion that follows from the Prime Minister's speech  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJune  last  year  about  Singapore of  the  21st  century.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 Committee, of which I am a Member, and I declare my\r\n\r\ninterest,  Sir, will undertake its work on Singapore's heartware\r\n\r\nduring  the course of this budget year.  There is a real danger,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  some will think that the relevance of  heartware  is\r\n\r\nsidelined by economic exigencies.  I hope that many more will be\r\n\r\npersuaded  that,  to  the contrary, the  question  of  heartware\r\n\r\nbecomes  even more important this year.  It is precisely  during\r\n\r\nthese  testing times that the heartware becomes vital and people\r\n\r\nhave an opportunity to unite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does heartware and the priority of rallying the people\r\n\r\nfind expression in this present Budget?  I am encouraged by  the\r\n\r\nfarsighted and generous provision for education.  There is every\r\n\r\nneed  for  a long-term and sustained commitment to the education\r\n\r\nof  our youth.  Additionally, Sir, I believe more can and should\r\n\r\nbe done for heartware in terms of charities and the arts.  These\r\n\r\ntwo subjects are of course very different.  But they connect  to\r\n\r\nheartware, how we take care of the less fortunate in our society\r\n\r\nand  how we give expression to ourselves as Singaporeans.   Both\r\n\r\ncharities  and  the  arts  also  need  long-term  and  sustained\r\n\r\ncommitment  and  they  both  share the  prospect  of  diminished\r\n\r\nfinancial support during the coming hard year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic uncertainties of 1998 will likely cause\r\n\r\nbusinesses and individuals to cut back on their contributions to\r\n\r\ncharities and the arts.  Some arts groups I have spoken to  have\r\n\r\nalready  seen or anticipate a drop of about a quarter  of  their\r\n\r\nsupport.   The  Government's emphasis  has  been  on  the  `many\r\n\r\nhelping  hands' approach.  The Government is not to be the  sole\r\n\r\nprovider  but  businesses, individuals and the people  sector  - societies,  clubs and others -  must also help.  I  do  not  ask\r\n\r\nGovernment to change the `many helping hands' policy.  I do  not\r\n\r\nask  them  to step in with more money where private  sector  has\r\n\r\npulled  back,  although of course there seems to  be  more  than\r\n\r\nample surplus for this.  What I do ask is for Government to keep\r\n\r\nits  contribution to charities and the arts constant, as far  as\r\n\r\npossible.  If there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncuts  by  this  Government, this would be read  by  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  that the Government accepts that these matters  are  not\r\n\r\npriorities.   Then  they too will cut back.  The  other  helping\r\n\r\nhands will take their signal from Government.  In this way,  our\r\n\r\n`many  helping hands' policy means that a cut of a single dollar\r\n\r\nby  Government  must be multiplied by the corresponding  cut  of\r\n\r\nother helping hands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also ask Government to recognise that even if their\r\n\r\ncontribution to charities and the arts remains constant, the cut-back by the private sector will be felt.  That is to say, in the\r\n\r\n`many helping hands' approach, the pulling back of any one  hand\r\n\r\nwould  destabilise  the  charity or the  arts  in  question.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  ask  Government to consider  if  there  are  ways  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  private sector hand to remain constant  even  in\r\n\r\nthese coming hard times.  One measure, it seems to me, is to use\r\n\r\nthe tool of double deductions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we currently allow contributions to approved charities\r\n\r\nand  the arts to be deducted from taxable income on a one-to-one\r\n\r\nratio.   My  suggestion  is  that  this  ratio  be  doubled.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  a  double deduction is already  available  for  some\r\n\r\ncontributions  under  the National Heritage  Board,  mainly  for\r\n\r\ndonations  made  to  museums.   I  would  encourage  its   wider\r\n\r\napplication during the current downturn.  I reiterate that  this\r\n\r\nis not for Government to give more money or to give up the `many\r\n\r\nhelping  hands'  approach,  rather  my  suggestion  is  to  find\r\n\r\nincentives for private sector hands not to waver in hard  times.\r\n\r\nThis  would help maintain the consistent support that is  needed\r\n\r\nfor both the charities and the arts.  For charities, especially,\r\n\r\nit should not be the case, that in hard times, the recipients of\r\n\r\ncharity  who  can least help themselves would be  those  hardest\r\n\r\nhit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the Budget is not just a question of\r\n\r\ndollars  and  bottom lines.  It represents our priorities  as  a\r\n\r\nnation.   In bad times as much as in good, or even more  so,  we\r\n\r\nmust  prioritise not just big businesses and heartware but  also\r\n\r\npeople and heartware.  I urge the Minister to consider the needs\r\n\r\nI have pointed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the Minister has a\r\n\r\nparticularly  difficult task this year.  The groups  which  seek\r\n\r\nhis  assistance are many.  If the Minister accedes  to  all  the\r\n\r\nrequests,  we  will be well and truly on our  way  to  financial\r\n\r\nruin.   On the other hand, he cannot completely acknowledge  all\r\n\r\nrequests.   The  difficulty is always in identifying  and,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  defending his choices as being  legitimate.   This\r\n\r\nyear, in particular, there has been a chorus of complaints about\r\n\r\nthe  budget  due  partly  at  least  to  the  unreasonably  high\r\n\r\nexpectations of handouts aired publicly before the budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we assess the budget and to what extent are the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  legitimate?   I  would, as  a  point  of  reference,\r\n\r\nconsider  three  factors.   The  first  is  the  macro  economic\r\n\r\npicture.  Does the budget serve to retain investor confidence in\r\n\r\nSingapore and show the world that we are rational people who set\r\n\r\na  steady  course and do not steer away from it?  By that  test,\r\n\r\nthe  budget scores extremely well.  It tells the world  that  we\r\n\r\nare  in a strong position, that there is no reason to panic  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  are no U-turns.  By going for budget  surplus  even\r\n\r\nthis year and by refusing to accede to most of the requests  for\r\n\r\nhelp,  the  Minister has produced what I would call a  \"crunchy\"\r\n\r\nbudget.   It is a word I borrowed from a journal which uses  the\r\n\r\nyardstick  of crunchiness to test government policy, crunchy  as\r\n\r\nopposed  to being soft.  It is a crunchy budget which recognises\r\n\r\nthat  there will be pain, and rightly recognises that  generally\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot  ameliorate that pain.   The  Government  has\r\n\r\nsucceeded until now by being crunchy and not by being soft.   It\r\n\r\nshould continue on that course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of reference that I would use is to\r\n\r\nconsider  the  extent  to which the Government  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nconsider  or  create  a  macro economic environment  which  will\r\n\r\nprovide  the  framework for sectors of the  economy  to  thrive.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Minister has to be commended for recognising the need\r\n\r\nfor creating the right environment for the banking and financial\r\n\r\nsectors  to  grow.  People complain that this is a  Shenton  Way\r\n\r\nbudget.  That criticism appears to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverlook  two  points:  first,  that  the  manufacturing  sector\r\n\r\nalready  has several tax breaks and incentives and that  perhaps\r\n\r\nthis budget simply tries to equalize that position vis-a-vis the\r\n\r\nbanking  sector.   Secondly,  the  criticism  really  fails   to\r\n\r\nrecognise  the  great potential there is for  Singapore  if  the\r\n\r\nfinancial sector's full potential is recognised and realised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point of reference that I would refer to I will\r\n\r\ncall  the  cost  of business issue.  It is not the  Government's\r\n\r\nbusiness to do micro economic tinkering or molly coddle specific\r\n\r\nsectors.   The  Government should broadly aim to  provide  macro\r\n\r\neconomic  stability, keep taxes low and provide its services  at\r\n\r\nmarket rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the Government do about the services that it\r\n\r\nprovides?   The  Minister  has heard over  the  years  the  same\r\n\r\ncomplaint - the costs of doing business are too high -  and  his\r\n\r\nreply  has  also  been  the  same.  I would  suggest  perhaps  a\r\n\r\nslightly   different  way  of  considering  the  problem.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  provides  various  services  and  charges  for  such\r\n\r\nservices.  The private sector complains that the charges are too\r\n\r\nhigh.   The Government, on the other hand, says that the charges\r\n\r\nare  at market rates and such charges are also sometimes imposed\r\n\r\nto  try and achieve certain socio-economic goals.   Having heard\r\n\r\na Member of the GPC who heard representations from the industry,\r\n\r\nall  I  would say to the Minister is that there is a substantial\r\n\r\ngulf in the perception between the Government and private sector\r\n\r\nas  to whether the charges are at market rates and whether  they\r\n\r\nare  fairly reflective of the market rates.  This year, in  view\r\n\r\nof  the  economic  situation, the Government should  review  its\r\n\r\ncharges and the cost of its socio-economic policies, bearing  in\r\n\r\nmind that often it is a monopoly provider of such services.  And\r\n\r\nit  should  carefully  review and, where possible,  the  charges\r\n\r\nshould be in line with the  prevailing economic conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, one other point is that the Minister must\r\n\r\nknow  that  the retail sector has been suffering for years,  but\r\n\r\nconsistent with what I said earlier, I am not herer to plead the\r\n\r\ncase  for the retail sector or any other sector.  But this year,\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsector  faces even more challenges, and this is a year when  the\r\n\r\nindividual   Singaporean  is  likely  to  have  less  liquidity.\r\n\r\nMortgage  rates are higher.  Incomes are going to  be  squeezed.\r\n\r\nOne  should  consider whether this is the year when tax  rebates\r\n\r\nshould in fact be reduced from 10% to 5%.  It appears a peculiar\r\n\r\nmove.  It will mop up what liquidity there might otherwise  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in the market.  The Minister may reply by saying that  the\r\n\r\nrebate is a bonus anyway and that it is at the discretion of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  And my short reply to that would be that as far  as\r\n\r\npossible,  more  money  should be left with  the  individual  to\r\n\r\ndecide how he or she wishes to spend it, rather than mopping  it\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  during these difficult economic times, it is prudent  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  still plans to achieve a budgetary  surplus  of\r\n\r\n$2.7  billion.  Some people have said that the Government should\r\n\r\npropose  a very expansionary budget, and even chalk up a  budget\r\n\r\ndeficit, in order to pump-prime the economy which may enter into\r\n\r\nrecession soon.  I believe, however, that what characterizes our\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic  problems, and makes  it  different  from  our\r\n\r\nprevious  recessions, is our vulnerability to external  economic\r\n\r\nshocks.  The fall-out from Indonesia's deepening crisis may  hit\r\n\r\nus much harder than we can currently anticipate and, if it does,\r\n\r\nwe  may well need a mid-year mini budget which may advocate some\r\n\r\ndeficit  spending.  But at this current state of uncertainty,  I\r\n\r\nsupport a policy of conservative prudence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reassuring to know that the Government is spending on\r\n\r\nlong-term investments on education, infrastructure and  defence,\r\n\r\nwhich truly underpin our economic success.  We cannot just  talk\r\n\r\nabout  our economic fundamentals;  we must continually  reinvest\r\n\r\nin  honing and sharpening these fundamentals, which this  budget\r\n\r\nhas done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is disappointment, however, about the lack of\r\n\r\nimmediate palliative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  to help small and medium enterprises in their business\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  Many SMEs feel that the Government could have cut\r\n\r\nmore  levies,  fees,  charges  and taxes  and  increased  public\r\n\r\nspending  in  more  sectors  of the economy,  thereby  improving\r\n\r\ncashflow and business prospects in the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may not think that the conditions are\r\n\r\nserious  enough,  but a survey done by the  Chinese  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  in  January 1998 indicated that 94% of the respondents\r\n\r\nwere  adversely affected by the regional financial  turmoil.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  authorities  will monitor the situation  closely  and\r\n\r\nprepare  in  time  contingency  measures  to  deploy  off-Budget\r\n\r\nexpenditures to assist struggling enterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the need\r\n\r\nto   spend  more  in  areas  which  I  think  are  important  to\r\n\r\nSingapore's long-term development.  I shall confine  my  remarks\r\n\r\nto  the  community service sector.  I would like to propose  six\r\n\r\npriorities for budgetary expenditures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, more spending on social development projects because\r\n\r\nprevention  is  better  than cure.  In the budget's  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  FY  98, the Ministry of Community  Development\r\n\r\n(MCD)   is  given  the  lowest  priority  among  all  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries.  It is just 0.11% of GDP, with the exception of  the\r\n\r\nnewly-created   Manpower  Ministry  which  has  no   development\r\n\r\nexpenditure at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I recognise that development projects for other\r\n\r\nMinistries are equally worthy of our attention and support, I am\r\n\r\nconcerned and curious to know why a Ministry such as MCD,  which\r\n\r\nhandles  family  support  services  and  community  intervention\r\n\r\nprogrammes to promote families and prevent their disintegration,\r\n\r\nhas less need for development projects than other Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I observe some disturbing social trends which were recently\r\n\r\nreported  in our newspapers: increasing youth crimes,  teenagers\r\n\r\nnot  confiding  in  their parents, rising  divorces,  increasing\r\n\r\nsingle  households'  problems,  declining  `O'  and  `A'  levels\r\n\r\nresults  and  low esteem among those who did not  fare  well  in\r\n\r\n1997, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may well accept that the Ministry of Home Affairs with\r\n\r\nall  its  responsibilities will be given  a  development  budget\r\n\r\nwhich  at  $900  million is more than  five times  greater  than\r\n\r\nMCD's development budget, which is $178 million only.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is perhaps a little lopsided, however, is the fact\r\n\r\nthat  MHA's  Police programme alone, which is $240  million,  is\r\n\r\ngiven  a  development budget which is 45% more  than  the  total\r\n\r\ndevelopment  budget of the entire MCD.  The equivalent  is  $240\r\n\r\nmillion for the Police programme and $116 million for the entire\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure for MCD.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if there is a correlation between an expanded\r\n\r\nPolice programme and family instability, ie, the more unstable a\r\n\r\nfamily,  resulting  in  family  abuse,  runaway  kids  and  drug\r\n\r\naddiction and other concomitant problems, the more the need  for\r\n\r\npolicing  activities  to  keep  crime  rates  down  and  restore\r\n\r\ncommunity security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an argument that in the long-run, it is a more\r\n\r\neffective  and  sustainable strategy  to  invest  and  encourage\r\n\r\npreventive  programmes  in neighbourhood  FSCs  (Family  Service\r\n\r\nCentres)  by  MCD than having to spend on remedial  institutions\r\n\r\nlike  the  Police  Force, drug centres,  prisons  and  detention\r\n\r\nhomes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar vein of thinking, more development expenditure\r\n\r\nby  the  Government  on  family  life  education  programmes  in\r\n\r\npromoting  family  relationships will prevent spousal  violence,\r\n\r\nchild  abuse  and juvenile delinquency, creating  less  need  to\r\n\r\ndeploy  police  officers  and health  officers  in  clinics  and\r\n\r\nhospitals  in the management and rehabilitation of the violence.\r\n\r\nThe  dollars  wasted in the time and energy  spent  in  managing\r\n\r\nfamily  conflicts is not inconsequential.  Some  countries  have\r\n\r\nshown  that the aggregated resources spent represented a sizable\r\n\r\npercentage of the GDP.  It may be worthwhile for us to attempt a\r\n\r\nsimilar  evaluation exercise.  If MHA were to focus on  remedial\r\n\r\nrather  than  preventive programmes, then perhaps MCD  could  be\r\n\r\ngiven a larger development budget to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nundertake   preventive  programmes.    The   increase   in   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure for MCD, however, is only 7%  which  is\r\n\r\n$12  million over the last fiscal year, whereas for  the  Police\r\n\r\nprogramme, the increase is 38%, which is $66 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, spend to build a body of knowledge in our community\r\n\r\nservice  delivery system.  A more serious concern  is  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  MCD  will  spend only $7.5 million or 1.4%  of  its  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  about $532 million on research and  information\r\n\r\ntechnology.   And  in MHA, there is not even  any  provision  on\r\n\r\nresearch  at  all.  How much of MCD's research  and  information\r\n\r\ntechnology budget will actually be spent on research  on  family\r\n\r\nand community issues, I do not know.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to emphasise the importance of having\r\n\r\ncontinuously  updated, integrated data on families  at  risk  to\r\n\r\nhelp   policy  makers  from  various  Ministries  define   their\r\n\r\nmanagement  strategies  and operational procedures.   A  one-off\r\n\r\nnation-wide survey on families which MCD is currently engaged in\r\n\r\nmay  be  necessary  and useful for identifying  demographic  and\r\n\r\nfamily relationship patterns, but it does not substantively  add\r\n\r\nto  our enforcement officers' operational knowledge which should\r\n\r\nbe  grounded by case analysis, informed by research  inputs  and\r\n\r\ntested by practices uniquely adapted for our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without building up a research department within the\r\n\r\nMinistries,  handling family cases or providing the  budget  for\r\n\r\nsuch efforts to be undertaken by other academic institutions for\r\n\r\nthe  Ministries, we will find our enforcement officers less  and\r\n\r\nless  equipped  with effective intervention and  family  therapy\r\n\r\nmethods and able to identify the necessary social programmes  to\r\n\r\nenhance service standards among our frontline workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, spend to set up a Neighbourhood Continuum of\r\n\r\nServices for all ages.  It is an important item on my wish  list\r\n\r\nto see more but small, efficiently run old folks homes, children\r\n\r\ncentres, youth hang-out joints, family service centres, day-care\r\n\r\nrehabilitation centres for the old and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisabled,   special  programmes  for  physically  and   mentally\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged in more schools in every constituency.  As to  how\r\n\r\nmany  of  these  services need to be set up in relation  to  the\r\n\r\npopulation base in the constituency, what optimal size  will  be\r\n\r\nideal to achieve best performance, the number of workers and the\r\n\r\nkind  of social work skills we require, these are key issues  to\r\n\r\naddress, and I do not think we really know.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, spend to identify national manpower needs in the\r\n\r\nsocial  service sector.  Without guided research data to  inform\r\n\r\nus  exactly  what are community service needs, we  may  be  busy\r\n\r\nbuilding  more  development  projects,  but  unable  to  clearly\r\n\r\nevaluate  their  relevance, impact and  sustainability  for  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  which  needs our services.   How  do  we  even  start\r\n\r\nmapping  the needs of the community and determine the  continuum\r\n\r\nof services and skills to be set up?  It will be the public, the\r\n\r\nvulnerable  victims  and  dysfunctional  families  who  will  be\r\n\r\nshortchanged  due  to incompetent service  standards.   It  also\r\n\r\nresults in economic wastage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By comparison, our Government seriously identified the need\r\n\r\nfor  skills upgrading in our workforce and a large sum of  money\r\n\r\nis  put aside by the Ministry of Manpower to retrain our workers\r\n\r\nin  the industrial sector after research into skills retraining.\r\n\r\nWe  all  agree  to  this  pro-worker and pro-business  directive\r\n\r\nbecause  it  enhances our competitiveness and fuels  our  growth\r\n\r\nengines  in the economy.  In a similar manner, I argue  that  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  commit  priority  time  and  resources  to  critically\r\n\r\nevaluate community  service delivery programmes, identify  where\r\n\r\nthe  needs are, train our social workers and volunteers with the\r\n\r\nnecessary  skills  to offer the public value-added  service  and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation treatment so that as healthy and well  integrated\r\n\r\nfamilies,  we help to build the social foundation for  Singapore\r\n\r\nto cope with the challenges of the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, budget for fitting the puzzles of Inter-Ministry\r\n\r\nmanagement and integration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another component which I think should be included in a\r\n\r\nbudget  is  programme  management and evaluation  expenses.   In\r\n\r\ncases of juvenile delinquency and drug offences, violence in the\r\n\r\nhome  involving young children and other family disputes,  their\r\n\r\nmanagement  is  very often beyond the boundary of one  Ministry.\r\n\r\nTake  a  family  violence case, for example.   It  involves  the\r\n\r\nintervention efforts of MOH, MCD, MHA, MOE, the Courts and FSCs.\r\n\r\nI take an example of  spousal violence case.  MOH will determine\r\n\r\nthe  extent of abuse through medical examination; MCD offers the\r\n\r\nsocial support through FSCs and protects the child by taking her\r\n\r\nor him to a place of safety; MHA offers protection and safety to\r\n\r\nthe   victims  and  directs  abusers  for  rehabilitation;   MOE\r\n\r\nidentifies cues and signs of abused children or child  witnesses\r\n\r\nin  schools  to  intervene early before  their  traumas  deepen.\r\n\r\nRecognising  that  case management has to be  multi-disciplinary\r\n\r\nand involves multiple parties from different Ministries, we need\r\n\r\nto  study,  pilot  and evaluate intervention and  rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this argument, I would like to propose that the\r\n\r\nMinister set aside a special budget to pay a team of consultants\r\n\r\nto  re-engineer a cross boundary integrated study  in  community\r\n\r\nmanagement.  It is time to take a fresh look and review as  well\r\n\r\nas  recommend  how  Ministries can and should  work  effectively\r\n\r\ntogether to solve social problems.  Models from  other countries\r\n\r\nand their experts can be consulted for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last budget proposal is for a Central Registry of\r\n\r\nvictims   and  perpetrators  for  fast  response  and  efficient\r\n\r\nintervention.  In most countries, a Central Registry is  set  up\r\n\r\nto  capture victims' information in computers so that front-line\r\n\r\nagencies  like the police, the courts, the hospitals,  FSCs  and\r\n\r\nHelplines are electronically linked up to better able  to  track\r\n\r\noffenders and victims and adopt appropriate prevention  measures\r\n\r\nbefore crimes are alerted.  A national priority must be given to\r\n\r\nsetting  this up for the purpose of promoting quick alert,  fast\r\n\r\nresponse, efficient referrals and cross-checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have highlighted six budget priorities for the community\r\n\r\nservice  sector  which I hope the Minister will  look  into  and\r\n\r\nconsider  giving  off-Budget expenses for their  implementation.\r\n\r\nIf  we give $3 million to start up each of these programmes, the\r\n\r\ntotal  will  only be $18 million, which is a small drop  of  the\r\n\r\nexpected  surplus of $2.7 billion.  The return on investment  in\r\n\r\ndollars  spent  in  this  sector, unlike  in  business,  is  not\r\n\r\nimmediately  calculable,  but  as  in  education,  its  rational\r\n\r\nreinforcement only helps to refine our social service network of\r\n\r\ninstitutions  and  expertise and restore to  the  community  its\r\n\r\nsense of well-being.  A sense of well-being felt by Singaporeans\r\n\r\nis arguably a most competitive human resource which we can bring\r\n\r\nto  the  economy  and  this country.   That,  for  me,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\npriceless and enduring.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in spite\r\n\r\nof  this year's budget being dubbed a prudent one, I am glad  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  many  MPs who have spoken before  me  are  generally\r\n\r\nsupportive  of  it.  The Budget Statement is in  line  with  our\r\n\r\nlarger  goals  of  preserving our long term competitiveness  and\r\n\r\nachieving  a  stable growth pattern as we position ourselves  to\r\n\r\nbecome a developed economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is impressive is the Finance Minister's ability to\r\n\r\nshow  a  surplus  of $2.7 billion or about  1.7%  of  GDP  in  a\r\n\r\ndifficult  and  uncertain  year.   This  is  important   as   it\r\n\r\ndemonstrates   to  fellow  Singaporeans  and  the  international\r\n\r\nbusiness   community  that  in  spite  of  the  financial   woes\r\n\r\nenveloping  the region, and to some extent our economy,  we  are\r\n\r\nstill intent on building our reserves even though it may be  the\r\n\r\nlowest in years.  The financial crisis has certainly proven  the\r\n\r\nimportance   of  building a strong and healthy reserve,  without\r\n\r\nwhich  we  would  have suffered the same fate  as  some  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours did in the regional currency battering.  For the year\r\n\r\nahead  of us, what is even more important is the fact that  this\r\n\r\nvery surplus will become available immediately for infusion into\r\n\r\nthe  economy  should  there  be a need  for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nimplement  off-Budget  measures,  as  already  promised  by  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister, Dr Richard Hu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as stated by several Members already, the financial\r\n\r\nservices sector is once again the major beneficiary of the  host\r\n\r\nof  incentives unveiled in the Budget Statement.  As this sector\r\n\r\nis  one of the key propellants of our economy and the fact  that\r\n\r\nit  is also tied to our goal to be a global financial centre and\r\n\r\na  regional business hub, it is therefore appropriate  for  this\r\n\r\nsector to be given a further boost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, I am pleased to note that there is no softening\r\n\r\nin the allocation of funds for education, although we could have\r\n\r\ndone  better  in  setting  aside  more  funding  for  Continuing\r\n\r\nEducation  and  Training  (CET)  in  the  wake  of  the  current\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis.  I am sure several of my labour MP colleagues\r\n\r\nwill  touch on this subject at length.  In spite of the need  to\r\n\r\nbe  prudent in crafting the Budget during this unstable  period,\r\n\r\nwe  must  continue  to  build on the philosophy  and  wisdom  of\r\n\r\n\"teaching  a  man  how  to  fish\".  Inculcating  creativity  and\r\n\r\nthinking  skills  in  our  school  children  will  provide   the\r\n\r\nfoundation  for  them  not only to survive  in  an  increasingly\r\n\r\nchallenging world but will also shape their mental framework  to\r\n\r\novercome adversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in the wake of our expected growth slowdown\r\n\r\nand the full impact of the regional economic crisis expected  to\r\n\r\nbe felt this year, it is fair for the business community to also\r\n\r\nanticipate  a budget that would offer them some relief  to  help\r\n\r\nthem tide through the current difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As already stated by Mr Leong Horn Kee, Chairman of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Parliamentary  Committee  for  Finance,  Trade   and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  and  also being a member of the Committee  myself,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  echo  the  disappointment  expressed  by  the  various\r\n\r\nChambers  of  Commerce  and Industry and the  trade  groups  and\r\n\r\nassociations  the Committee met with after the  announcement  of\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  Statement.  They  strongly  felt  that  the  budget\r\n\r\nprimarily benefited certain segments of the financial sector and\r\n\r\nfailed to provide sufficient reprieve in lowering business costs\r\n\r\nin the current difficult and challenging business environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the financial crisis afflicting the region,\r\n\r\nmany  of  our local businesses are experiencing various setbacks\r\n\r\nand  are  cash  strapped due to their exposure in  the  regional\r\n\r\nmarkets,  especially Indonesia, Malaysia and  Thailand.   Demand\r\n\r\nfor  the  products  they  sell to these  countries  has  sharply\r\n\r\ndecreased  due to the exchange rate situation, and at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime their imports from these countries are finding fewer buyers\r\n\r\nas   Singaporeans  tighten  their  belts  on  spending.    Sales\r\n\r\ncontracts  made  before the currency crisis and  denominated  in\r\n\r\nregional  currencies are resulting in drastic  exchange  losses,\r\n\r\nand  to  make matters worse, payments are coming in slower  than\r\n\r\never before, thereby contributing to cash flow difficulties.  On\r\n\r\nthe  local front, interest rates are higher and banks  are  more\r\n\r\nconservative in extending credit.  Many businesses are therefore\r\n\r\nconfronted  with  tight cash flow, reduced turnover,  relatively\r\n\r\nhigher costs, and potentially higher bad debt exposure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent widening of the scope of the Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS) is indeed the sparkle in  the\r\n\r\nBudget  for our local businesses, especially for the  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  It will help to alleviate cost\r\n\r\npressures  on  businesses.  However, some groups  expressed  the\r\n\r\nconcern  that  the  enhancement will  primarily  benefit  larger\r\n\r\ncompanies  which will be viewed more favourably by the financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in their lending considerations,  whether  or  not\r\n\r\nthey are prepared to co-share the lending risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that some attention be given by the\r\n\r\nadministrating   body   of  the  scheme,   ie,   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nProductivity  and Standards Board (PSB), to deserving  companies\r\n\r\nwhich may have difficulty in securing working capital loans from\r\n\r\nthe financial institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the wide range of Government assistance schemes\r\n\r\navailable  for  companies  to  take  advantage  of,  the   local\r\n\r\nenterprises  continue to feel that there  is  room  for  further\r\n\r\nsimplification of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe procedures.  Many are turned off by the amount of paper work\r\n\r\nrequired  to  apply  for the schemes.  I  hope  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies administering the various schemes could look\r\n\r\ninto this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the 15% tax rebate for commercial and\r\n\r\nindustrial properties, while this directly benefits the property\r\n\r\nowners, there is concern that many private owners will not share\r\n\r\nthis concession with their tenants.  I suggest that some form of\r\n\r\na  concession-sharing formula be considered to require landlords\r\n\r\nwho  rent  out their properties to share the rebate  with  their\r\n\r\ntenants.  Only then will this concession benefit a wider  cross-section of the business community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the extension of rent freeze by the JTC and HDB, it\r\n\r\nwas  strongly felt that the freeze did not offer anything  extra\r\n\r\nto  lower  operating costs, as both agencies  had  frozen  their\r\n\r\nrentals  since the middle of last year.  As rent in  most  cases\r\n\r\nrepresents  the  second highest component of  business  cost,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that this area be closely looked at as a possible  off-Budget action, should the situation worsen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On corporate tax reduction expected by certain quarters, I\r\n\r\npersonally  feel that it would not make much of a difference  to\r\n\r\nbusinesses in a year where profits are expected to be  generally\r\n\r\nlower or where there are no profits to be made at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do hope that some form of a multi-tier corporate\r\n\r\ntax  system for local SMEs as proposed by Mr Lew Syn Pau in last\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget  debate is being considered by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.   As  an example, Mr Lew suggested that  the  first  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  in  taxable income could be taxed at 15%, the  next  $3\r\n\r\nmillion at a higher rate of 20% and amounts above $5 million  at\r\n\r\nthe long term rate of 25%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a move will help local SMEs grow faster as the savings\r\n\r\nin  corporate tax could be ploughed back into the business.  One\r\n\r\nway  to  ensure that the money is reinvested is  to  make  it  a\r\n\r\ncondition that companies could only enjoy the scheme if the  tax\r\n\r\nsavings are retained in the business for re-investment purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the 5% one-off tax rebate for\r\n\r\nindividuals,  while  I  do  understand  the  rationale  for  the\r\n\r\nreduction  from  the 10% one-off given last  year,  I  wish  the\r\n\r\nMinister  could  have been more generous in  the  light  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic gloom.  The relief could have helped  make  up\r\n\r\nfor  the declining disposable income anticipated this year as  a\r\n\r\nresult of lower variable bonuses and salary increases because of\r\n\r\nmore  difficult business conditions.  The spare cash  could,  in\r\n\r\nturn,  be  channelled back into the economy to help  the  ailing\r\n\r\nretail sector which is experiencing a serious slowdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is important in this rapidly changing and\r\n\r\nevents-driven economic environment for the Government to closely\r\n\r\nfeel  the  pulse  of the business community  and  economy  on  a\r\n\r\nregular basis to ensure that off-Budget measures could be  taken\r\n\r\nswiftly before the situation becomes very difficult to contain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe there is\r\n\r\nan  urgent  need  for  businesses  to  learn  that  they  cannot\r\n\r\ncontinually  look up to the Government to solve  their  business\r\n\r\nproblems.   They  need to be educated on the  realities  of  the\r\n\r\nharsh  and fiercely competitive business environment which calls\r\n\r\nfor   responsiveness  to  changing  circumstances  and  customer\r\n\r\nexpectations in the smallest possible lapse of time.  They  must\r\n\r\nbe  made  to  understand that survival today  means  effectively\r\n\r\nmanaging perpetual motion or risk becoming obsolete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, amidst the gloom hovering over us, it is\r\n\r\nimportant also for us not to be obsessed with the negatives  and\r\n\r\nforget  about the opportunities abound in the region.  With  the\r\n\r\nstrength   of   the  Singapore  dollar  relative   to   regional\r\n\r\ncurrencies, there are tremendous opportunities to acquire or buy\r\n\r\ninto companies which are in dire need of capital infusion in our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy in the\r\n\r\nname of the Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I move on to speak\r\n\r\non the Budget, may I just say a few words about how refreshing I\r\n\r\nfound Dr Tan Cheng Bock's outburst on,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  I guess, an attempt to silence even an MP speaking up.   I\r\n\r\ndo  hope  that Dr Tan Cheng Bock would accept the invitation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Leader  to  move  a motion in the House  that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould not be admonished or stepped down for speaking up, and he\r\n\r\nwill  find in me a ready supporter.  I await the motion from  Dr\r\n\r\nTan Cheng Bock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you wish to give way to Dr Tan?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No, Sir.

May I move on to the\r\n\r\nBudget  because  we  are allowed half an  hour  for  the  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make a few introductory remarks\r\n\r\nabout  the Budget before I come to the specific concerns  of  my\r\n\r\nParty on this Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.35 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that, reading it, it sounded to me more like the 1997 Budget.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a rehash of the 1997  Budget.   It\r\n\r\nread more like the 1997 Budget than a Budget for this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other observation that I wish to make is that, as has\r\n\r\nbeen  mentioned  by  a  number  of  speakers,  the  Government's\r\n\r\nassessment of the impact of the financial turmoil in the  region\r\n\r\non  Singapore  seems  to  be different  from  that  outside  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Government would appear to take the  view  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should come off quite well without getting  hurt  too\r\n\r\nbadly.  But that does not appear to be the view of the people in\r\n\r\nthe  business community and outside.  We only had the  statement\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore National Employers' Federation on 4th  March,\r\n\r\nreplying to the head of the NWC saying that there should  be  no\r\n\r\ncuts  in the basic pay.  The Federation's reply was that it  was\r\n\r\ntoo early to say pay cuts were not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary and that some companies had already taken the step  to\r\n\r\ncut  the  pay of their executives.  This is something  that  was\r\n\r\nlost  on the Deputy Prime Minister when he replied to my  motion\r\n\r\nabout  six weeks ago.  Because he seemed to think there were  no\r\n\r\npay  cuts outside the Government and Government should not  move\r\n\r\nin first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are these conflicting views. And as has been\r\n\r\nexpressed,  this  Budget would appear to be  not  alive  to  the\r\n\r\nseriousness of the economic crisis that faces us.   I  get  that\r\n\r\nimpression.  It seemed more alive in the 1985 Budget but not  in\r\n\r\nthis Budget.  A thought passed my mind and that was whether  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  was perhaps getting a bit too  old  in  being\r\n\r\nFinance Minister, or getting tired of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. You shall not be personal with\r\n\r\nyour remarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Sir. I am sorry. But may I\r\n\r\nalso  then move on to the other observation that I wish to make,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  this.   He  says in his Budget  speech  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  keeping a \"tight lid\", a cap  on  operating  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditures.  And he goes on to say elsewhere  that\r\n\r\nit  was  the Government's \"deliberate policy to keep the  public\r\n\r\nsector  lean and trim\".  Having said that, if one looks  through\r\n\r\nthe Budget, one finds that the operating expenditure has gone up\r\n\r\nby $1.12 billion over 1997, and that is, after the Minister says\r\n\r\nit  will be the policy of this Government to keep a tight lid on\r\n\r\nexpenditures,  particularly operating expenditure.   I  have  no\r\n\r\nquarrel  with  the increase in the development expenditure,  but\r\n\r\nthis operating expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at the expenditure for the Prime Minister's Office.\r\n\r\nAnd  I see the operating expenditure there has gone up this year\r\n\r\nby $7.55 million.  I also read what was the work programme under\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's portfolio.  And if I may  read  from  the\r\n\r\nBudget book, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The work areas under the Administration programme include\r\n\r\nproviding  administrative support to the Prime Minister,  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  and Deputy Prime Minister, administering the Singapore\r\n\r\nState Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, allocation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  state  cars as well as matters relating to National  Honours\r\n\r\nand  Awards.  The Elections programme covers the production  and\r\n\r\npublic  exhibition of the registers of electors, maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthe  electoral database and conduct of elections in an  election\r\n\r\nyear.   The  Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau investigates\r\n\r\nallegations  and complaints of offences under the Prevention  of\r\n\r\nCorruption Act, maintains records of persons investigated by the\r\n\r\nBureau and provides screening services to public authorities and\r\n\r\nauthorised organisations.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To administer this programme which, as I have read,\r\n\r\nincludes, among other matters, administering the State Arms  and\r\n\r\nFlag,  the  National Anthem Rules, allocating  state  cars,  the\r\n\r\nelections  programme  and  the Corrupt  Practices  Investigation\r\n\r\nBureau,  we  are told that the operating expenditure  should  be\r\n\r\nraised by another $7.55 million.  And we are told also that this\r\n\r\nprogramme  is  administered by no less than four Ministers,  one\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister  (this post has been vacant for  the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears but apparently it is considered necessary to have a Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  as well, besides the four Ministers), one Minister  of\r\n\r\nState,   one   Parliamentary   Secretary   and   two   Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries.   Really,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  do  we  need   six\r\n\r\nMinisters to administer the work programme that I have just read\r\n\r\nout?   And  I  see  that,  of  the  increase  in  the  operating\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  it  is  the expenditure on political  appointments\r\n\r\nthat  has gone up by $4.4 million from 1997, and it has gone  up\r\n\r\nby  $7.4  million from 1996.  I see the Prime Minister has  left\r\n\r\nthe  House,  but  I  was hoping we would  hear  from  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, because the Finance Minister may not be in a  position\r\n\r\nto  answer  this.   Why  do  we  need  all  these  Ministers  to\r\n\r\nadminister this programme?  Is this, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  a\r\n\r\ncase  of  Parkinson's law in operation?  And do  we  still  need\r\n\r\nnannies  for  the  Ministers to oversee what the  Ministers  are\r\n\r\ndoing  in their own Ministries?  I say this because it seems  to\r\n\r\nme  that  not  enough  thought has been given  to  what  we  are\r\n\r\nspending  on  the  administration.   I  have  taken  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office as an example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, may I move on, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to my Party's\r\n\r\nconcerns  in this Budget.  Several speakers have spoken  of  the\r\n\r\nconcern  of the business sector.  I am not here to say  that  we\r\n\r\nshould not take care of the business sector.  They are most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant.   But at the same time, I think one must  not  forget\r\n\r\nthat  labour  has an equal part to play in the  economy  and  in\r\n\r\nattempts to resuscitate the economy.  And as I said, my Party is\r\n\r\nconcerned  about the effect on the workers.  Before  I  come  to\r\n\r\nthat, may I also mention something which I have overlooked,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the total absence in this Budget of any cost  cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures  on  the part of the Government.  Mention  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  made  of  no announcement of JTC and HDB decreasing  their\r\n\r\nrental  charges  or  that  they have any  intention  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nNeither  is  any mention made of the amount of revenue  that  is\r\n\r\ncollected by the Government in fees and licences.  Do  we  still\r\n\r\nhave  to  maintain these high fees and licence charges when  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses are finding it difficult to make their ends meet?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move on to the Party's concern. The Minister\r\n\r\nsays again, in his Budget, that our priority this year should be\r\n\r\nto  protect  jobs.  We say amen to that.  But look  through  the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement and we see no word at all of how the Government\r\n\r\nproposes  to protect the jobs of the workers.  As was  mentioned\r\n\r\nby   the  Singapore  National  Employers'  Federation  in  their\r\n\r\nstatement  on 4th March, the rate of unemployment has  increased\r\n\r\nthis  year and several speakers have mentioned this.  I was told\r\n\r\nthe  other  day, when I was at Ang Mo Kio, of a company  telling\r\n\r\none  of its workers that either he took a pay cut or face losing\r\n\r\nhis  job.   How is the Government going to protect the  workers'\r\n\r\njobs?   Has  the  Government any plans to  stop  employers  from\r\n\r\ntaking  advantage of the recession to terminate the services  of\r\n\r\nworkers  who have been with them for years and employing cheaper\r\n\r\nlabour?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last sitting of this House, when there was a\r\n\r\nquestion  from  my  Party Member to the  Minister  about  paying\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits to workers who have worked for  more  than\r\n\r\n10  years, the Minister of State said that there was no need for\r\n\r\nany  legislation.  May I tell the Minister for  Labour  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  if there had been some legislation  protecting\r\n\r\nthe  workers'  rights by requiring employers to pay compensation\r\n\r\nfor unfair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntermination, employers would not be trigger-happy, to  use  that\r\n\r\nterm, to lay off their workers.  But we do not have any such law\r\n\r\nand, as I said then, our workers are completely at the mercy  of\r\n\r\nthe  employers.   What is the position of our workers  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nforeign  workers?   Are  they  going  to  lose  their  jobs   in\r\n\r\npreference to foreign workers?  Sometime ago, I thought  I  read\r\n\r\nabout  the Secretary-General of the NTUC, who is also a  Cabinet\r\n\r\nMinister,  saying that it would not be right to expect companies\r\n\r\nto  keep  Singapore workers and only get rid of foreign  workers\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Causeway, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I see the\r\n\r\ngovernment has announced its intention to keep strict  watch  on\r\n\r\ncompanies  laying off workers by requiring them to  explain  the\r\n\r\nproposed retrenchment.  Does the Government here propose  to  do\r\n\r\nanything like that?  Then there is the question of retraining of\r\n\r\nworkers.   I  had asked the Minister for Labour to let  me  know\r\n\r\nwhat  is  being  done  by the Government on retraining  and  his\r\n\r\nprivate  secretary rang up to say, \"You can't have it now.   The\r\n\r\nMinister will be giving an answer in the House on Monday and you\r\n\r\nwill  have  it  then.\"  I have not been able then to  study  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  plans on retraining.  So it is very difficult  for\r\n\r\nme  to  speak on that.  But I think Mr Chiam has already touched\r\n\r\non  it slightly, and that is, it does not seem really to provide\r\n\r\nfor the situation that we are facing at the moment.  A lot of it\r\n\r\nis  left  to  the  employers  or the agencies  outside  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment itself is not controlling the retraining of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister went on to speak about the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  rolling back on welfare.  I think the  Minister  was  a\r\n\r\nlittle unfair.  If he had studied what the Labour Government  in\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom has planned, he will find that it is not just\r\n\r\nrolling back welfare payments for workers but has prepared  well\r\n\r\nthought-out  plans  and  schemes to find  employment  for  those\r\n\r\nbetween  18 and 25 and for those who are over 25 who  have  been\r\n\r\nunemployed.   There  are  booklets  available  and  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMinister   should  look  at  them.   Why  cannot  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment do something on those lines?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the relief or help for those who lose their\r\n\r\njobs.   All the Minister can offer is the rent rebates  and  the\r\n\r\nservice and conservancy rebates and the utilities rebates.   But\r\n\r\nthe  rent rebates and S&C rebates are lower this year than  what\r\n\r\nthey  were  last  year.  For 1- and 2-room  flats,  the  S&C  is\r\n\r\nreduced  by one month.  For a 3-room flat, it is reduced  by  1\ufffd\r\n\r\nmonths.   For a 4-room flat, it is reduced from one month  to  _\r\n\r\nmonth and for a 5-room flat, it is reduced from one month  to  \ufffd\r\n\r\nmonth.   Is  that all the help that the Government  proposes  to\r\n\r\ngive  to people who are going to find themselves without  a  job\r\n\r\nand  are unable to make their ends meet?  Is there nothing  else\r\n\r\nthat  this Government can do?  There was a wonderful opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister and for the Government to do  something,  not\r\n\r\njust for the wealthy but for the entire country, and that was to\r\n\r\nsuspend  the  Goods  and  Services Tax for  the  period  of  the\r\n\r\nrecession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we were opposed to the Goods and\r\n\r\nServices Tax.  We called it an evil tax, an unfair tax.  But the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proceeded, and the result was an immediate  increase\r\n\r\nin prices of everything.  Of course, retailers and manufacturers\r\n\r\nhad  to  put up their prices if they have to pay the  Goods  and\r\n\r\nServices Tax.  And I see that it is now a good earner in revenue\r\n\r\nfor  the Government.  For 1998, it is estimated at $1.95 billion\r\n\r\nand  it has gone up by $90 million over 1997 and it is the third\r\n\r\nbiggest earner in tax revenue.  I was curious to see that  there\r\n\r\nwas another item \"Other Taxes\" which brought in $2.3 billion.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  the Minister would explain  what  these  \"Other\r\n\r\nTaxes\"  are.   And  again,  the fees  and  services  collections\r\n\r\naccount  for a very significant portion of the revenue.   May  I\r\n\r\nask  the Minister: was suspension of the GST ever considered  at\r\n\r\nall?   Even if it was not thought possible to suspend the  whole\r\n\r\nGST,  was  any  thought given to exempting the  tax  from  basic\r\n\r\nnecessities like food and clothing and education?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the water tax? Was any thought given to\r\n\r\nsuspending  the  water  tax and other taxes  on  basic  services\r\n\r\nprovided to the people?  We were told that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason  for the water tax was because there was a threat to  cut\r\n\r\noff  our  water  supply.   But now, we have  been  told  by  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  government that it has no intention to  cut  off  the\r\n\r\nwater  supply.  So will the Minister consider waiving even  that\r\n\r\nlittle  bit,  cutting  off the water tax, because  that  affects\r\n\r\nalmost every household in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Budget should address all\r\n\r\nsections  of the community.  As I said, we have no quarrel  when\r\n\r\nit  addresses  the concerns of the business community.   But  it\r\n\r\nabysmally  fails to address the concerns of the workers  and  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  not well-to-do.  And it is, Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  many ways a very disappointing Budget.   As  has  been\r\n\r\nmentioned,  the  business  community is  not  exactly  clapping.\r\n\r\nNobody  is clapping at this Budget.  It is unfortunate that  the\r\n\r\nMinister has missed the many opportunities that were open to him\r\n\r\nand  to  the Government to show that it was concerned about  the\r\n\r\neconomy  and  its effects on the people and that it  would  take\r\n\r\ninto  account the hardships of our people and that is why I call\r\n\r\nthis  a  most  disappointing Budget we have had for  many,  many\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I heard a very\r\n\r\nrefreshing and interesting speech by my parliamentary colleague,\r\n\r\nDr  Tan  Cheng  Bock, but not the speech and viewpoints  of  the\r\n\r\nNCMP.   That aside, I know that you are functioning  on  a  very\r\n\r\ntight  schedule.   So I shall be very precise and  raise  a  few\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to state that this year's budget is\r\n\r\nrather  prudent  and  I expected some giveaways  for  low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies,  but  there are less giveaways  this  year.   This  is\r\n\r\nunderstandable as the economic situation is expected to be tight\r\n\r\nfor the next few years.  However, I would state that it would be\r\n\r\nbetter  to maintain a status quo in terms of the budget,  rather\r\n\r\nthan  to increase other  related charges because there were off-Budget  charges  which  had  been implemented  earlier  such  as\r\n\r\nelectricity, medical and property charges.  The increases  which\r\n\r\nhave   been   announced  by  some  Ministries  and  restructured\r\n\r\nGovernment bodies have increased the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nburdens  of  the  households  and  companies.   These  increased\r\n\r\ncharges  should be reviewed as they were implemented before  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn.   I  hope the Minister,  in  his  off-Budget\r\n\r\nproposals,  would  take  this  into  consideration.   Sir,  such\r\n\r\npractices  should  be carefully monitored  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nbudget is not jettisoned out of course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on a number of issues. First,\r\n\r\nis  the  plight of the low income pensioners.  The pleas of  low\r\n\r\nincome  pensioners have been heard by the Minister many a  time.\r\n\r\nI hope he will not just hear but act to bring some relief to the\r\n\r\npensioners.   It  is high time that we revised the  pensions  of\r\n\r\nvery low income pensioners, particularly those whose pension  is\r\n\r\nvery low and meagre, much lower than the public assistance rate.\r\n\r\nThese  pensioners have given sterling services to the Government\r\n\r\nduring  their  time and it is about time that we  gave  them  an\r\n\r\nuplift  their life and their shoe-string income.   And  this  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  the case for those without children and  immediate\r\n\r\nrelatives.  I think they do deserve our attention and we  should\r\n\r\nprovide  the  best  of  support we  can  give  for  this  group.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there  is  an  argument that there  is  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAllowance,   I  do not think that the allowance   together  with\r\n\r\ntheir  meagre pension would reduce their burden at all.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat the Minister should give very close attention to this group\r\n\r\nof low income pensioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue is to look at the effects of\r\n\r\ncorporatisation.   In  the  last  five  years,  Government   has\r\n\r\ncorporatised  various public sector services.  The  question  we\r\n\r\nshould  ask ourselves is whether the corporatised public  sector\r\n\r\nservices are achieving their objectives.  Are these corporatised\r\n\r\nbodies efficient and effective?  I think it is very important to\r\n\r\nreview their performance at this stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of public sector services such as health\r\n\r\ncare,  telecommunications, power and gas, and broadcasting  have\r\n\r\nmade  their  presence felt in the last number of  years  through\r\n\r\ncorporatisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  restructuring.  They set charges and  commit huge expenses.\r\n\r\nA  lot  of  them spend millions of dollars.  All these decisions\r\n\r\nhave  implications on the consumers, namely, cost and efficiency\r\n\r\nof  services.   In  short, one cannot ignore that  these  public\r\n\r\nservices  must be affordable to the majority of the  population.\r\n\r\nSir,  I must say that there is always the temptation that  these\r\n\r\ncorporations strive to make high and mindless surpluses, as they\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  to  show up as inefficient.  When  this  happens,\r\n\r\nconsumers  would  have to carry the brunt as they  have  limited\r\n\r\nalternatives to purchase services, other than telecommunications\r\n\r\nwhere  there has been competition in telecommunication services.\r\n\r\nA  number  of operators have come in.  Prices have been  reduced\r\n\r\nand I am sure you would agree with me that it would be a welcome\r\n\r\nchange  to  have  a number of other operators to provide  public\r\n\r\nservices  so that they can give the monopolistic private  sector\r\n\r\nservices a run for their money.  I must say that the interest of\r\n\r\nthe  consumers must be protected and regulatory bodies  must  be\r\n\r\nestablished to make them accountable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read with much concern the comments of the Public\r\n\r\nAccounts  Committee which  stressed for more  accountability  of\r\n\r\ncorporatised public services and statutory boards.  It  is  high\r\n\r\ntime  that the Government imposed some controls on them so  that\r\n\r\nthe interests of the consumers are safeguarded.  I think this is\r\n\r\nvery  critical at this stage of growth and there is  a  need  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  there  is good accountability from  these  various\r\n\r\ncorporatised public service bodies.  I want to find out from the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether these corporatised public service  bodies  are\r\n\r\nefficient  in  making surpluses or cost effective  in  providing\r\n\r\nservices.   This is essentially a very important issue  that  we\r\n\r\nwould have to review and  examine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on incentives for savings, we have to encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to save more, and not to spend  money that they can\r\n\r\nsave.   The  spend  culture  will  make  us  more  indebted  and\r\n\r\neconomically  vulnerable.   We cannot  expect  to  be  a  strong\r\n\r\nsociety  if  we  have low reserves.  I would like  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to give incentives or rebates to those who save.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  will have to encourage a more saving culture so that we will\r\n\r\nbe  more  consolidated and  be able to manage even in  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of training for workers, particularly\r\n\r\nolder workers, companies that have older workers should be given\r\n\r\ntax  rebates  for training of their workers besides the  funding\r\n\r\nfrom  the Skills Development Fund.  The Skills Development  Fund\r\n\r\nis  not  comprehensive to cover various grades of  workers.   An\r\n\r\nadditional tax rebate for companies which take active  steps  to\r\n\r\nretrain   older  workers  should  be  considered.   The  present\r\n\r\nincentives  are cosmetic and not serious enough to step  up  the\r\n\r\ninterest  to  train our workers.  It is important  to  encourage\r\n\r\nsome  of these companies to think about more innovative ways  to\r\n\r\nretrain  older workers.  And I am sure the Minister could  be  a\r\n\r\nbit  more  liberal and provide grants and support  to  companies\r\n\r\nwhich   are  more  positive  and   prepared  to  undertake   the\r\n\r\nretraining of older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore is facing financial and economic difficulties.     How\r\n\r\nlong  the difficult situation will continue or how deep it  will\r\n\r\nsink  is  still  uncertain.  But what we can see  is  that  many\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are faced with a stagnated market and  serious  cash\r\n\r\nflow problems.  Many people are faced with a reduction in income\r\n\r\nor  even unemployment.  Everybody is trying to adjust or  adapt,\r\n\r\nbut  they soon discover that the options open to them to  adjust\r\n\r\nor adapt are not many.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the business community, many items of operational cost\r\n\r\nsuch  as  rent, wages and various Government charges  are  fixed\r\n\r\nexpenditures.   The  little  bits  of  rebates  offered  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot effectively bring down the  operational  cost\r\n\r\nfor  them to pull through.  As for the ordinary citizens who are\r\n\r\nunemployed  or have suffered a reduction in income,  they  still\r\n\r\nhave   to   pay  the  instalments  for  their  mortgage   loans,\r\n\r\neducational  fees, GST and the various charges  that  have  been\r\n\r\nraised again and again over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate last year, I pointed out that the\r\n\r\nescalation  of  the  various  service  charges  such  as  public\r\n\r\ntransportation, refuse collection fees, university  fees,  water\r\n\r\nconservation  tax  and  the  selling  price  of  HDB  flats  was\r\n\r\nworrying.  I also warned the Government that if it was unable to\r\n\r\nresolve  the problem of business cost resulting in the  workers'\r\n\r\nsalaries  being  stagnated or the factories closing  down,  then\r\n\r\nthe pressure on the people would be mounting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, many people are already facing this\r\n\r\npressure.  The Government should review the price mechanism that\r\n\r\nit  has  been  employing  all the time  to  achieve  its  policy\r\n\r\nobjectives.  The side effect from the price mechanism  principle\r\n\r\nis  higher  cost  of  living  and higher  operational  cost  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   When times are good, and business  is  good,   the\r\n\r\nvarious costs and charges would go up.   Once the economy  takes\r\n\r\na downturn, income is reduced,  and they will face a big problem\r\n\r\nbecause the fixed expenditure cannot be changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the business community, when the economy is good, the\r\n\r\ncosts  of  materials and operations will go up.  When sales  are\r\n\r\ngood,  they  could still manage to pull through.  But  once  the\r\n\r\nsituation  is  bad, when their sales drop, they would  not  make\r\n\r\nenough  money  and they will have a serious cash  flow  problem.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this high cost of operation, the profit  margin  is\r\n\r\nlow,  and they could not save enough for a rainy day.  Once they\r\n\r\nface  difficulties  and are caught in the  midst  of  instalment\r\n\r\npayments,  there  is  no way they would  adjust  or  trim  their\r\n\r\noverhead expenses to tide over.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this budget, it is apparent that the Government feels\r\n\r\nthat  the  economic situation faced by Singapore is not  serious\r\n\r\nenough.   But  the  survey by the Singapore Chinese  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry  reveals that  more  than  half  of  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are facing cash flow problems.  A global  securities\r\n\r\ninstitution,  Morgan Stanley, has predicted that  Singapore  may\r\n\r\nface  zero  growth in its economy.  I hope that the Government's\r\n\r\njudgment this time is correct.  I hope that it would not  repeat\r\n\r\nwhat it did in 1985 when it waited until\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany companies had closed down and the economy was well battered\r\n\r\nbefore  they resorted to contingency measures.  What  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  is that when the Government levy taxes, they  always\r\n\r\nsay  that we have to provide for a rainy day.  But when  we  are\r\n\r\nhaving  difficult  times, when the people are  tightening  their\r\n\r\nbelts  and  not  knowing  whether they  could  tide  over,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not come to their rescue.   All  they  say  is,\r\n\r\n\"wait  and  see\".   When the people are faced with  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblems,   the   Government's  policy  is   to  enhance   their\r\n\r\nemployability  so  that  they could resolve  their  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.   If  you  can find a new job that pays  you  the  same\r\n\r\nwages,  it is well and good.  But if you cannot get a  job  that\r\n\r\ngives  you  the same pay or you cannot even get a new job,  then\r\n\r\nwhat is going to happen?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we face an economic depression, when people are facing\r\n\r\na long unemployment situation and if the Government is unable to\r\n\r\nattract  new investments to create job opportunities, then  what\r\n\r\nprotection  can we give to our workers?  What I am more  worried\r\n\r\nis  that, with the financial crisis in this region, the value of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore dollar may be affected.  Our imported goods would\r\n\r\nbe  more expensive and our people will face serious problems  of\r\n\r\ninflation.   Under  such  circumstances,  would  the  Government\r\n\r\npromise to suspend the collection of  GST?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also said that if the economy takes a\r\n\r\nturn  for  the  worse,   it  will  consider  reducing  the   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates  or allowing people  to  withdraw  some  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings to tide over.  But the problem is how much money do  our\r\n\r\npeople  have  in their ordinary accounts in the  CPF?   The  HDB\r\n\r\nflats are getting more and more expensive. Under the new policy,\r\n\r\nthe  people   have  to withdraw everything they  have  in  their\r\n\r\nordinary accounts before they could obtain a loan from HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that many Singaporeans have only enough CPF savings\r\n\r\nto  pay  for their loan instalments. What happens if one day  we\r\n\r\nsuffer  a very serious depression and many people are unemployed\r\n\r\nand  faced with serious inflation, what can our people rely  on?\r\n\r\nWhen the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic situation is good, the Government feels that the people\r\n\r\ncould  afford it and they keep on increasing charges.  When  the\r\n\r\nbudget  is  released, the rebates given to  the  people  are  so\r\n\r\nsmall.   It is just like trying to put out the fire of a burning\r\n\r\ncart-load of wood with a cup of water.  When salaries are frozen\r\n\r\nor incomes are reduced, the Government does not provide anything\r\n\r\nfor  them.   To  the Government, it is a situation  whereby  the\r\n\r\n\"horses  will continue to be raced, and the taxes will  continue\r\n\r\nto be levied.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, during the Budget debate last  year, the MP for Hougang\r\n\r\nused  the  analogy of \"wool coming from the back of the  sheep\".\r\n\r\nThis  year,  he switched to the horse, saying \"the  horses  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be raced, and the taxes will continue to be levied\".\r\n\r\nThis   being  the  \"Year  of  the  Tiger\",  I   think  the  most\r\n\r\nappropriate  animal  to  be used as an analogy   should  be  the\r\n\r\ntiger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial and currency crisis this time is like a\r\n\r\ntiger.  When  the  tiger  is around,  we  will  have  difficulty\r\n\r\nclimbing the mountain.   I think the Government should play  the\r\n\r\nrole  of  the legendary hero Wu Song.   In the episode from  the\r\n\r\nChinese classic The Water Margin,  Wu Song drank three big bowls\r\n\r\nof  strong liquor to gather enough courage to go to the mountain\r\n\r\nwhere  he  encountered the fierce tiger and killed it  with  his\r\n\r\nbare  fists.  Our Government can play the role of Wu Song,   but\r\n\r\nit  relies  on prudent financial policy rather than  alcohol  to\r\n\r\ndefeat the \"tiger\".   We must go to the mountain, face the tiger\r\n\r\nsquarely  and  defeat it, for the benefit of not  only  our  own\r\n\r\npeople but the people around us as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget is presented in the midst of a regional\r\n\r\nfinancial   and  currency  crisis.  It  hits  our   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  like Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand,  and  we  are\r\n\r\nalso affected.  Our Singapore dollar is also affected.  However,\r\n\r\nI feel the impact of the currency turmoil has not been fully and\r\n\r\nadequately  reflected  in  this Budget.   Perhaps,  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister wants us to remain unruffled.  He does not want  us  to\r\n\r\nbe unduly worried.  He only indicated that if the situation gets\r\n\r\nworse, he   will take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noff-Budget  measures to assist the people.  I hope that  in  his\r\n\r\nreply  tomorrow,  he can enlighten us  on what  measures  he  is\r\n\r\ngoing to take to pull us through the difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, some companies are beginning to downsize or\r\n\r\nrestructure and many workers are affected.  I feel that this  is\r\n\r\na  very  important lesson to learn. At a time when  we  want  to\r\n\r\nattract foreign talents, we should also help our own workers  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  skills.  However, there is  no  mention  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget  of  any specific measures to promote  job upgrading  for\r\n\r\nour workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businessmen feel that this Budget has not provided\r\n\r\nadequate  help  to  the small and medium enterprises.   Although\r\n\r\nthere  are existing packages to help them, they feel that it  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which \"you can see but cannot enjoy\".  The government\r\n\r\nofficials, on the other hand,  say \"You do not see it, thus  you\r\n\r\ndon't  enjoy  it.\"   So there is a perception  gap  between  the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  and the bureaucrats.  I feel that  we  should  have\r\n\r\nmore dialogues between the SMEs and the authorities so that  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community can understand what facilities are available\r\n\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, some people feel that owners of 5-room HDB flats\r\n\r\nshould  be entitled to the same rebates as those living  in  the\r\n\r\nsmaller   flats,  because  living  in  bigger  flats  does   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean that they are better off than their  neighbours\r\n\r\nin the smaller flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these observations, we can see that people are more\r\n\r\nconcerned  with their own interest.  Of course, we cannot  fault\r\n\r\nthem  for looking after their interest.   But at a time when  we\r\n\r\nare faced with this regional financial crisis, we should have  a\r\n\r\n[                          ] \"sense of crisis\" rather than the [\r\n\r\n]  \"sense of self-interest\".  I feel that in this budget we have\r\n\r\nnot  fully  made  use of this opportunity to  inculcate  in  our\r\n\r\npeople  a  sense of crisis.  Let us reflect on what happened  at\r\n\r\nthe  SilkAir accident. After the crash, many people came forward\r\n\r\nand  signed  the  book  of condolence and  attended  the  public\r\n\r\nmemorial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservice.   It is a very valuable lesson.  Singaporeans are  more\r\n\r\nunited  and  have  more human touch because  of  this  incident.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should make use of this regional financial  crisis\r\n\r\nto  unite our people so that we have a sense of crisis and  have\r\n\r\nless sense of self-interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also encourage the people to upgrade themselves.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past few years, many Singaporeans have been  upgrading.\r\n\r\nThey  have been upgrading in terms of their housing.  When  they\r\n\r\ncan  afford  it,  of course, it is well and  good  for  them  to\r\n\r\nupgrade.   Unfortunately,   there  are  many  people   who   are\r\n\r\nupgrading  even  when they could not afford it.   They  upgraded\r\n\r\nfrom  a small flat to a big flat, and then from a big flat to  a\r\n\r\nbigger  unit.   Now,  because of this crisis,  many  people  are\r\n\r\nchanging  from the bigger flats to the smaller flats.  They  are\r\n\r\ndowngrading!    In  fact, the people should be    encouraged  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their skills rather than their flats.  In the past,  we\r\n\r\nsaid that a skill in hand can benefit you for a whole life time.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the present context, one skill is just not enough.   We\r\n\r\nmust be multi-skilled so that we will not be caught in the wrong\r\n\r\nfoot in the face of an economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Government's policy to curb property\r\n\r\nspeculation.   I  feel that we should encourage our  workers  to\r\n\r\nupgrade themselves.  Not only the workers, but even the managers\r\n\r\nand CEOs should also upgrade their skills.\r\n\r\nOf course, this financial crisis has some negative effect on us,\r\n\r\nbut it has also brought to us some revelation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we have a very stringent and highly transparent\r\n\r\nmonetary  policy.  It is because of this that  we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nwithstand  the  impact  of  this  recent  regional  turmoil  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are beginning to understand this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our people are beginning to realise that they\r\n\r\ncannot keep raising their expectations indefinitely.  They  must\r\n\r\nhave the ability to adjust to changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, whether it is investment or speculation, we have\r\n\r\nto  face risks.  Although for investment the rate of return  may\r\n\r\nnot be very high, if you speculate you may lose your last penny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I feel Singaporeans should have more sense of crisis and\r\n\r\nless  sense of self-interest.  I hope the Minister will give  us\r\n\r\nmore  details on the off-Budget measures he proposes to take  if\r\n\r\nthings get worse,  when he replies tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for giving me this opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I proceed with the Budget proper, I hope you\r\n\r\nwill  allow  me to comment on the point raised by Dr  Tan  Cheng\r\n\r\nBock, and state my view to this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with him and the other Members that no civil\r\n\r\nservants   should  undermine  the  confidence  of   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  and  their  standing  in  public  as  well   as   in\r\n\r\nParliament.   However, Sir, when we discuss  the  conduct  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  is  outside  this House,  we  should  be  cautious,\r\n\r\ntemperate in our language, and we should see that in no  way  do\r\n\r\nwe  cast  aspersion of the civil service as a whole  because  no\r\n\r\nmatter  how  strong the political leadership is,  if  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants  are  not committed to carry out the work,  goods  will\r\n\r\nnever be delivered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a Member wants to speak on the conduct of a civil\r\n\r\nservant, he should at least file a proper motion.  Dr Tan  Cheng\r\n\r\nBock,  in fact, spoke more on the Chairman of EDB than  on  this\r\n\r\nBudget.  I think it is proper that we, the Members, should abide\r\n\r\nby  the  Standing Orders.  I especially remember reading in  the\r\n\r\npapers  some  years  back  when an hon.  Member  of  this  House\r\n\r\ncriticised  somebody outside this House and Members  took  great\r\n\r\nexception.   I  think we should re-express the  same  sentiments\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we examine the Budget presented by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance with the background of the turmoil that  is  facing\r\n\r\nmany South East Asian countries, we can say that this has been a\r\n\r\nBudget without pain.  The Budget is positive, prudent and, if  I\r\n\r\nmay say so, promising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our priorities are right. Defence and education have been\r\n\r\ngiven  top  priority and they should be so.  I am glad  that  no\r\n\r\nMember so far, either opposition or from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government  backbenchers or the NMPs,  has  questioned  the\r\n\r\nspending on defence and it is important because we are living in\r\n\r\na  turbulent world.  Defence and stability cannot be  taken  for\r\n\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a very pragmatic budget. This did not come\r\n\r\nabout  because  of the planning just of last year.   It  is  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  careful  finance balancing  and  planning  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has taken over the years.  Some Singaporeans take  it\r\n\r\nfor  granted that this is a natural process.  Some believe  that\r\n\r\nthere will always be some surpluses.  Sir, while talking of  the\r\n\r\nsurplus, I am a little disappointed that the Minister could have\r\n\r\nbeen  a bit more charitable by giving less surplus and the money\r\n\r\ncould  have been channelled to areas which I am going to discuss\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a stable, open, transparent, honest Government which\r\n\r\nis  committed  to improving the life of the people  has  brought\r\n\r\nabout  this Budget.  Even the Government's worst critics  cannot\r\n\r\ndeny  the  Government's sound fiscal policy.   In  any  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, the people have a pivotal role to play. So  is  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  our  economy and our people.  The people must  undergo\r\n\r\nsome  sacrifice  now  for a better future.   All  of  us  should\r\n\r\nupgrade  our  skills  even if it may mean  some  change  in  our\r\n\r\nlifestyle.  Here, I agree with Mr Seng Han Thong that we  should\r\n\r\nall,  irrespective of what our position in economic life,  train\r\n\r\nourselves.  Some temporary loss would yield gain in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to share some concerns shown by the\r\n\r\nprivate property owners.  They are concerned that the prices are\r\n\r\nfalling, distressed sales are on the rise.  The bottom  line  is\r\n\r\nyet  to come.  It is reassuring to note that the glut in private\r\n\r\nproperty  would not increase as the Government will control  the\r\n\r\nrelease  of  land.  I urge the Minister to review  the  position\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time to see that the property market does not fall\r\n\r\ndramatically.   I  believe a long slump in the  property  market\r\n\r\nwill not be good for the economy.  But having said that, let  me\r\n\r\nadd  a  word  of  caution, Sir.  I share the  sentiments  of  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh.  We must not allow the free\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket  forces  to  be  stifled.  While we  must  see  that  the\r\n\r\nproperty market is protected, we must not allow the free  market\r\n\r\nto be flouted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am a little disappointed, and I\r\n\r\nshare the sentiments by some Members of this House, that despite\r\n\r\nthe  urgent need for skills training, the Minister has not  been\r\n\r\nvery  generous in this area.  No special fund has been allocated\r\n\r\nfrom the Budget to train the workers.  All we have is a previous\r\n\r\nset-up  under the Skills Development Fund.  I urge the employers\r\n\r\nto  take  more interest in skills training.  Wherever  possible,\r\n\r\nthey   should  not  wait  for  retrenchment  or  wait  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  call  for  skills training.   They  on  their  own\r\n\r\ninitiatives  should  try  to  find  out  which  area  of  skills\r\n\r\ndevelopment will help them.  The Government could in some  cases\r\n\r\noffer financial assistance to small enterprises so that they can\r\n\r\ntake  full  advantage of the workers' training.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\npresent system is not adequate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is encouraging that our\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector  is being reorganised and I  congratulate  the\r\n\r\nMinister for the various tax incentives in this area.  I am sure\r\n\r\nthis area will further grow, and let us hope that we will become\r\n\r\nthe best financial sector in the Far East.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage more fund managers and financial\r\n\r\nexperts  to  settle  down in Singapore.  Therefore,  I  have  no\r\n\r\nhesitation in supporting the Government's move to allow talented\r\n\r\npeople  to  come  and work here.  Singapore would  benefit  from\r\n\r\nthese people.  Our diplomatic missions abroad should promote the\r\n\r\npolicy as other countries are equally interested in wooing these\r\n\r\npeople.  They are in short supply.  We must not miss them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no doubt that the Government will not allow\r\n\r\nthese  talented personnel who have come here to take  away  jobs\r\n\r\nfrom  our people.  The simple truth is that we do not have  such\r\n\r\npeople  in  our midst.  Even developed countries are  trying  to\r\n\r\nattract  these talents.  We need them more than they.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhy even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA,  with  a  highly successful workforce,  is  trying  to  get\r\n\r\ncomputer  engineers  from Asia.  Similarly, medical  specialists\r\n\r\nare  in  high demand both in USA and UK.  I support, and I  hope\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean support this move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, where we do not have any natural resources,\r\n\r\nwe  are  depending  on  our manpower and our  location.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore very vital that we attract top talented people.   They\r\n\r\nwill  enrich  our workforce.  They will add high  value  to  our\r\n\r\neconomy  in  the end.  The whole economy will benefit.   And  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  be  shortsighted,  as  some  people  think  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  neglecting its own people.  The  truth  is  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  is concerned about Singapore citizens  and  we  will\r\n\r\nalways be concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government in allowing these people to settle is going\r\n\r\nto  help  the  workforce.  However, Sir, I have one caveat,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  important caveat.  We must try to  persuade  these\r\n\r\nskilled  people  to  train our workforce, to  train  our  senior\r\n\r\nechelon in the area of speciality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make an extra effort and sell to these people our\r\n\r\nsound  fundamentals and sound educational system.  We have  very\r\n\r\ngood  local  as well as international schools.  We  are  a  safe\r\n\r\nhaven where they can come and work and settle here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members are disappointed that the tax rebate has\r\n\r\nnot  been increased.  I am one of the minority who says that the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  been  very prudent.  The 5%  is  a  fair  figure,\r\n\r\nbearing in mind that the people who are going to pay these taxes\r\n\r\nare  those  who are in a higher bracket.  However, I would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  happier if some of the savings from the 5% could have been\r\n\r\nallocated  to  skills training.  I am hopeful that the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould look into this area when reviewing this, and when the need\r\n\r\narises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we look at the totality of the\r\n\r\npicture  and  not some areas, we are in a better  position  than\r\n\r\nmany  countries  of the world.  There seems to be  a  fear  that\r\n\r\nbecause  of the problems facing our neighbours, we may be  in  a\r\n\r\nlong  period  of economic recession.  I agree with the  Minister\r\n\r\nthat there will be no recession\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  our  fundamentals are very strong.  Our growth may be  slow,\r\n\r\nbut there will be some growth.  It is better to have a period of\r\n\r\ncooling-off.   An overheated economy can burn our  pockets.   We\r\n\r\nhave  overcome worse economic conditions.  We can do so provided\r\n\r\nwe are united in our resolve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, some Members have said that the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  failed  to  stimulate  the  economy.   Artificial\r\n\r\nstimulation,   whether  in  the  economy   or   in   any   human\r\n\r\norganisation,  can  never  be  satisfactory.   Let  the  natural\r\n\r\nprocess  take  its place, and only when we have  a  need  do  we\r\n\r\nintroduce stimulative measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification from\r\n\r\nthe Member?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Nominated Member says in his\r\n\r\nspeech  that  he  is glad to note that no Member of  Parliament,\r\n\r\nincluding   Opposition   MPs,  raised   questions   on   defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   I  would  like  to ask  him:  what  is  wrong  in\r\n\r\nquestioning defence expenditure and whether the Budget debate is\r\n\r\nnot  for  the purpose of questioning and scrutinising Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure, be it defence or any other Ministry?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I was\r\n\r\ntrying to state is that we all support the defence policy.

We  know  where   our\r\n\r\npriorities   lie.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the economic turmoil in the region has brought to  us  the\r\n\r\nrealisation that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  may  not  be  the master of  its  own  destiny.   The\r\n\r\neconomies  of  the  region are interlinked  and  interdependent.\r\n\r\nProsperity or misery felt by one may equally be felt by  others,\r\n\r\nalthough  the  dosage of bitter medicine may differ.   For  many\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans  who  have known only  prosperity  in  their\r\n\r\nworking  lives,  the crisis is surprising and frightening.   The\r\n\r\nusual response is: We are doing well.  Why are we affected?  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance is to be complimented for giving a detailed\r\n\r\naccount  of  the crisis, although we may need an update  as  the\r\n\r\nsituation changes even as we speak, such as the delay by the IMF\r\n\r\nin   paying   the  next  tranche  to  Indonesia,  and  Indonesia\r\n\r\nresponding    by   saying   that   the   IMF's    demands    are\r\n\r\nunconstitutional.   The  Minister  has  presented   a   careful,\r\n\r\nrestrained   Budget,  recognising  the  need  to   help   ailing\r\n\r\nbusinesses to promote certain desirable businesses and the  need\r\n\r\nto  continue  to  strengthen  the infrastructure  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that in terms of macro-economic planning,  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  introduced in the Budget would go some way to  meeting\r\n\r\nthe challenges posed by the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the young working population, however, the crisis\r\n\r\ntranslates  itself  not in terms of the IMF,  Central  Bank,  or\r\n\r\nmacro-economic policies.  To these young workers, the  questions\r\n\r\nare:   Does the wife have to go back to work?  Where can we  put\r\n\r\nthe  children, if she does that?  And what else  can  we  do  to\r\n\r\nservice  the  debts that we have accumulated.  Every  last  cent\r\n\r\ncounts.   This is typified by one young constituent who said  to\r\n\r\nme: Why only 5% rebate when we need every cent we can earn?   He\r\n\r\nknows  about the crisis.  He knows that one needs to be  prudent\r\n\r\nbut  he nonetheless is concerned that he cannot make ends  meet.\r\n\r\nIt is in this context that I have to ask whether the measures of\r\n\r\nrelief  to taxpayers, the 5% rebate, and the rebate on  HDB  S&C\r\n\r\ncharges,  are  sufficient to cater to the needs  of  many  young\r\n\r\nfamilies who are facing a year of uncertain wage policies.   The\r\n\r\nspectre  of retrenchment, of bankruptcy also may loom large  for\r\n\r\nsome.   Paradoxically,  at a time when  there  are  fewer  jobs,\r\n\r\nhousewives who did not contemplate an early return to work now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  have  to in order to buttress the family income.  But  they\r\n\r\nare  constrained by factors such as the lack of child  care  and\r\n\r\npre-school  facilities.   This  is  an  issue  that  should   be\r\n\r\naddressed in the current Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key pillars of Government policy is to invest in\r\n\r\nthe  young.  There is no doubt that much has been done  in  this\r\n\r\nregard,  especially in relation to the building of  schools  and\r\n\r\nthe  roll  out  of  the IT Master Plan for schools.   But  I  am\r\n\r\ntalking  about  the care for the very young - the pre-schoolers.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the provision of child care centres is within the\r\n\r\naegis  of the Ministry of Community Development while pre-school\r\n\r\nfacilities  are  undertaken by the PAP Community Foundation  and\r\n\r\nother  private agencies.  There is an acute shortage of  trained\r\n\r\nminders  and teachers in relation to the provision of facilities\r\n\r\nfor  the  pre-schoolers.  We do not have the quantity,  and  the\r\n\r\nquality  can  always be improved.  It seems  to  me  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be provision in the Budget for several measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to provide for institutions to train more child\r\n\r\nminders  and teachers for the pre-schoolers.  Second, to provide\r\n\r\nconcessions  or  subsidies  to  those  who  are  providing  such\r\n\r\nservices  so  that they can employ better teachers and  minders.\r\n\r\nAnd  third, to provide incentives or subsidies for the  training\r\n\r\nand  retraining  of teachers and minders for the  pre-schoolers.\r\n\r\nThere  is no provision for such measures in the current  Budget.\r\n\r\nThe  provision for child care in the MCD budget is a small  one,\r\n\r\nrelatively speaking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child care services and pre-schooling are taken very\r\n\r\nseriously in advanced countries.  For example, in France,  98.8%\r\n\r\nof  three-year olds and 100% of four-year olds are enrolled  for\r\n\r\npre-primary schooling.  In West Germany, the figures  are  30.8%\r\n\r\nand  68.5%  respectively.  In the US, the figures are 28.5%  for\r\n\r\nthe  three-year olds and 53% for the four-year olds.  The source\r\n\r\nis from the OECD: `Education At A Glance', published in 1995.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the industrialised economies\r\n\r\nmove  from  brawn  to  brains, it is never too  early  to  start\r\n\r\ncultivating the minds of our young.  The Minister has  mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  excellent  achievements of our  students  in  international\r\n\r\nsurveys.   That is a cause for happiness and congratulations  to\r\n\r\nour educators.  I believe, however, that studies have also shown\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  child care and pre-schooling  in  the  pre-primary  years.  A study in the United States that  took  nearly\r\n\r\nthree  decades to complete revealed that the group under  review\r\n\r\nwho  participated in pre-primary schooling had excellent results\r\n\r\nin terms of social discipline, in avoiding undesirable behaviour\r\n\r\nand  in  doing  well  in college.  This motivated  in  fact  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Government to spend about $3 billion  a  year  on  such\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   Admittedly, of course, the situation is  different\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  but  it certainly deserves more  attention.   We,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, do not have figures for Singapore which in itself\r\n\r\nis  a cause for concern.  As Singapore moves towards its goal of\r\n\r\nbecoming a developed country, such facilities grow in importance\r\n\r\nand should be provided on a larger scale.  It is hoped that such\r\n\r\nmeasures may be considered in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in these times of economic turmoil, all of us\r\n\r\nwould do well to remember that when times are hard, the need  to\r\n\r\nshow  character and regard for others is paramount.   No  doubt,\r\n\r\nthe  need to earn a comfortable wage is always uppermost but one\r\n\r\nmust be careful not to sacrifice principle for pay.  One of  the\r\n\r\nmost unfortunate incidents that has been mentioned in this House\r\n\r\nthat has come to light is the conduct of scholars in relation to\r\n\r\ntheir bonds, that is, the so-called bond-breakers.  Scholars are\r\n\r\nrole  models  for their younger counterparts who  are  still  in\r\n\r\nschool.  They shoulder not just legal obligations but moral ones\r\n\r\nas well.  Now these scholars have redeemed their bonds, have not\r\n\r\ncommitted  any  offence  or  civil wrong.   However,  the  moral\r\n\r\nresponsibility rests on them to fulfil what they promise to  do.\r\n\r\nMoral  responsibility  and a good sense  of  long-term  interest\r\n\r\nshould guide these scholars who are role models for our young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has provided us with a Budget\r\n\r\nthat  seeks to fuel investment confidence at a time of  economic\r\n\r\nuncertainty.  It is to be especially welcomed in this regard and\r\n\r\nI  hope  that the Minister will consider more measures  for  the\r\n\r\nyoung families that may face hardship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I strongly support the Minister in his\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  speak in support of the motion standing in the name  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, without doubt, the region in the last 10 months went\r\n\r\nthrough  a crisis that proved to be most challenging and perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  most  unnerving since the Second World War.   Never  before\r\n\r\nhave  we  seen  such relentless pressures on our  economy.   The\r\n\r\nregional currencies lost much value because of the sell down  by\r\n\r\nthose  who  lost  confidence.  Companies simply went  under  and\r\n\r\nunemployment  ballooned.  The mood soon  became  despondent  for\r\n\r\nmany.   This  proved to be the right recipe for  social  unrest.\r\n\r\nThe  disaffected and hungry took to the streets in violent anger\r\n\r\nwhile  governments most affected tried desperately to  stem  the\r\n\r\ntide  of  events.   The problems soon shifted from  an  economic\r\n\r\ndimension  to a political one in some cases, which  resulted  in\r\n\r\nthe erosion of confidence in government leadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, stable as it may be, by no means escaped\r\n\r\nfrom  the forces that affected the region.  As the Minister  has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  the  region's financial crisis  had  a  contagion\r\n\r\neffect  and  put a damper on the economic outlook for Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  growth  prospect for the economy seems  less  promising  as\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  began to brace themselves for a tough  year  ahead.\r\n\r\nIndeed  the  growth  estimate  of our  GDP  for  financial  year\r\n\r\n1998/1999  at approximately 2.5% to 4.5% from our GDP growth  of\r\n\r\nabout  7.8% in financial year 1997 projects a cautious  mood  on\r\n\r\nour  part  in  assessing the future.  In real terms,  all  major\r\n\r\nbusiness sectors, with the exception perhaps of some sectors  in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and construction, would see some weakening of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rightly, therefore, in view of the poor economic\r\n\r\noutlook  for the region and Singapore, in particular, that  this\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget  should  be  a prudent one.   Public  expenditure\r\n\r\nshould  be  trimmed  when necessary and Singaporeans  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged  where  possible  to be  constantly  mindful  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficult times that loom ahead.  While most people would accept\r\n\r\nthe  underlying  basis of our Budget this year, there  are  also\r\n\r\nmany  who  feel  that  this Budget does not  go  far  enough  to\r\n\r\nadequately  prepare  them for the conditions  ahead.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nlooking  at  the present Budget, it was felt that more  can  and\r\n\r\nshould  be  done to help the citizens in coping with the  rising\r\n\r\ncost  of living brought upon to some extent by the weakening  of\r\n\r\nour  currency.   There  are many who are disappointed  that  the\r\n\r\nrebate given is pegged at 5%, and not 10%.  It is arguable  that\r\n\r\nthe  rebate of 10% should be given to taxpayers to cope with the\r\n\r\ndifficult  conditions.  Even if the majority of Singaporeans  do\r\n\r\nnot pay taxes, maintaining a tax rebate at 10% would have sent a\r\n\r\nstrong signal support to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the majority of Singaporeans who do not pay taxes,\r\n\r\nwhich  speaks a lot about their annual income, I would urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  consider a greater rebate  on  the  service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy  charges  and utilities.  A greater  rebate  on  the\r\n\r\nservice and conservancy charges and utilities will go a long way\r\n\r\nin helping these citizens cope with the pressures of rising cost\r\n\r\nof  living in Singapore.  For the businessmen who have  invested\r\n\r\nin  the region, they are, I am told, disappointed that there  is\r\n\r\nno  additional  assistance from the Government  in  the  present\r\n\r\nBudget.   The  current financial crisis has  had  a  significant\r\n\r\nimpact on the operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, going regional is to a large extent\r\n\r\nencouraged and initiated by the Government.  To the extent  that\r\n\r\nour  businessmen  have responded to the call to  invest  in  the\r\n\r\nregion, the Government should actively assist these companies to\r\n\r\ncope with the present difficulties.  Additional tax reliefs  for\r\n\r\nthese  companies  in respect of their regional operations  would\r\n\r\nprovide the much needed moral support required at this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstage.   In the current financial crisis, the systemic  weakness\r\n\r\nof the business and financial institutions has often been blamed\r\n\r\nas  one  of  the  causes.   It  is often  said  that  the  close\r\n\r\nrelationship  enjoyed between the private  business  sector  and\r\n\r\nthose  closely  linked  with the establishment  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  some economies in the region went into difficulty.\r\n\r\nSuch  companies were extremely influential and as a  consequence\r\n\r\nwere  able  to  leverage on the connection which they  enjoy  to\r\n\r\nprocure financial institutions to lend monies on very soft terms\r\n\r\nand often not adequately securitised.  There was often no proper\r\n\r\nassessment  of  creditworthiness of  the  project  being  funded\r\n\r\nthrough the loans.  The banks found themselves in a position  of\r\n\r\nnot  being  able  to  recall  the loans  when  economic  weather\r\n\r\nchanged.  There was a lack of transparency in the system and  it\r\n\r\nresulted    in   much   institutional   weakness   and    hidden\r\n\r\ninefficiencies in the affected economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through it all, the regional crisis has also paid much\r\n\r\ncredence  to  a  cardinal principle that  government  should  be\r\n\r\ntransparent   as   far   as   possible.    Transparency   begets\r\n\r\naccountability which in turn controls the conduct of  those  who\r\n\r\nare  held  to  account.   In  every government,  the  degree  of\r\n\r\ntransparency  is  a  matter of calibration.   It  is  a  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  need to maintain confidentiality because  national\r\n\r\ninterest demands it and the need to keep the people informed  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  better exercise their right to vote.   How  the\r\n\r\ncalibration is to be made is dependent on the Government of  the\r\n\r\nday  who  enjoys  the  mandate of  the  people.   In  the  final\r\n\r\nanalysis, there is an increasing expectation these days  towards\r\n\r\ngreater transparency and accountability, where possible,  rather\r\n\r\nthan to have less of it.  How is this applicable to us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, we have come to accept Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies  (GLCs) as playing a strategic role in developing  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  As the Minister has said at the last sitting, the GLCs\r\n\r\nhave  moved into areas which are of strategic interest and where\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs in Singapore have limited resources to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nventure  into  or have no knowledge of.  In recent  years,  GLCs\r\n\r\nhave grown, both in number and size.  Today, there are few areas\r\n\r\nof  business  the  GLCs  have  not gone  into.   Their  business\r\n\r\ninterests  range from telecommunication, banking and finance  to\r\n\r\naerospace  and  property development.  The market capitalisation\r\n\r\nof these companies runs into hundreds of millions of dollars and\r\n\r\none  would  not  be wrong to say that the performance  of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies is a barometer of the state of the Singapore economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, GLCs, the way in which they are owned, managed and\r\n\r\nrun,  are  often  distinguished from ordinary  companies  for  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  reasons.  Firstly, these are companies  wherein  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has sizable equity interest in, either  directly  or\r\n\r\nindirectly, through such holding companies as Temasek  or  GSIC.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  a  substantial  number  of  officers  who  run  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  came  from the civil service.  And  thirdly,  a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  these companies have substantial business  relations\r\n\r\nwith the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by any measure, the GLCs have contributed in no small\r\n\r\nway  to  Singapore's profile as an industrial economy  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  given  us a place in the world economy that we  would  not\r\n\r\nhave  otherwise  got if we had just allowed the economy  develop\r\n\r\nits  own course without the GLCs.  However, as the GLCs grow  in\r\n\r\nsize and number and the value of the equity holding expands over\r\n\r\nthe  years, we must ensure that there is an adequate  system  in\r\n\r\nplace to provide for the accountability for the conduct of these\r\n\r\ncompanies.  At the moment, the scope of public accountability of\r\n\r\nthese  companies, both in relation to corporate  disclosure  and\r\n\r\ngovernance,   is   limited.   Presently,   officers   of   these\r\n\r\ncorporations  are  accountable under law to shareholders.   They\r\n\r\nowe a duty principally to the company.  However, in the case  of\r\n\r\nordinary  shareholders  who  own  shares  in  listed  companies,\r\n\r\nparticipation  at shareholders' meeting is often given  a  miss.\r\n\r\nEven if they are inclined to do so, the ordinary shareholders do\r\n\r\nnot  have  the necessary technical expertise to analyse  reports\r\n\r\nand hold directors to account by asking relevant questions.   In\r\n\r\nother words, there is usually very little\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknown   beyond  the  audited  accounts  about  these  companies.\r\n\r\nControl  of  these  companies is  often  in  the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nmanagers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, GLCs by virtue of the status, have very strong\r\n\r\nbargaining power in business dealings.  In a government that  is\r\n\r\nas  disciplined  as ours, we can be assured that  the  GLCs  are\r\n\r\ntightly  run and managed and that they are not likely  to  abuse\r\n\r\ntheir  privileged  position.  However, we cannot  always  assume\r\n\r\nthat  our system of Government and political culture will remain\r\n\r\nunchanged.  In a weak government, control over the GLCs may  not\r\n\r\nbe  firm.   There  will  always be a  danger  of   mismanagement\r\n\r\nwithout  a  proper system of control.  The consequences  may  be\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  that  which confront the countries  in  the  region\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, GLCs essentially provide a\r\n\r\ncorporate   vehicle   for  Government  to  go   into   business.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, because the Government is in business, there is  an\r\n\r\nexpectation that the forum of accountability of these  companies\r\n\r\nshould be wider than just a shareholders' meeting.  I share  the\r\n\r\nsentiment expressed by my colleague earlier wherein he said  the\r\n\r\nGLCs  perform essential functions within the economy.  In  these\r\n\r\ndays,  we  can  expect corporatised entities to provide  utility\r\n\r\nservices,  services  to  people  who  are  users,  who  are  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  shareholders in a company.  And in the  context  of\r\n\r\nthese people who have to depend on these companies for services,\r\n\r\nI  think  there  is  something to be said  about  holding  these\r\n\r\ncompanies to some extent accountable to the consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Public Accounts Committee feels, and I agree, that\r\n\r\nit  is important to ensure that public money invested in GLCs is\r\n\r\nwell  spent and decisions are made under the best circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe  call  is for greater accountability and through appropriate\r\n\r\ndisclosure,  information may be given as to the  performance  of\r\n\r\nthese  companies.  I would like to ask the Minister whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in addition to the measures which we  have  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  is  considering other measures to provide  for  greater\r\n\r\ntransparency and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisclosure in the GLCs.  Such a move, Sir, would strengthen  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the public in the management of our GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, when the Finance Minister was formulating the  new\r\n\r\nBudget  for  this year, many countries in Asia were  facing  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis and Singapore, to a certain extent,  has  been\r\n\r\naffected by this.  Therefore, in formulating the new Budget  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is bound to be prudent in its attitude.  When the new\r\n\r\nBudget  was disclosed, we knew that the Minister was adopting  a\r\n\r\nmoderate and prudent strategy to cope with the financial crisis,\r\n\r\nand   to   make   adequate  preparation  in  case  the   turmoil\r\n\r\ndeteriorates so as to cope with the difficult years ahead.   The\r\n\r\nMinister also ensures that we have a balanced budget in order to\r\n\r\nmaintain   our   long-term  economic  competitiveness   and   to\r\n\r\naccumulate massive surplus so that we will move forward when the\r\n\r\nfinancial  turmoil subsides.  I believe this is  a  correct  and\r\n\r\nfarsighted Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when our neighbouring countries are\r\n\r\nurging their people to donate money and other valuables to  help\r\n\r\ntheir countries weather the economic crisis,  our Government has\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  provide  tax rebates  and  rebates  on  S&C  and\r\n\r\nutilities  charges to the people so as to lighten the burden  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.   During this critical period, the  Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen able to provide assistance to the people.  Although this is\r\n\r\nnot  a big red packet, it nevertheless is something we are happy\r\n\r\nabout.   There are some taxpayers who say that the  tax  rebates\r\n\r\nhave  been reduced from 10% to the present 5% and they are quite\r\n\r\ndisappointed.   Tax rebate is normally given  only  during  good\r\n\r\ntimes.   It  is  a measure to return some of the wealth  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   But because of this year's economic slowdown  and  the\r\n\r\ntightening of our monetary policy, the budget has been  reduced.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to  be  expected.  But taxpayers feel that  their  tax\r\n\r\nreturn  was  based on 1997 income and yet they have to  pay  tax\r\n\r\nfrom  this  year's  income.   This year,  they  are  faced  with\r\n\r\neconomic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecession and there will be a reduction in their income.   Hence\r\n\r\nthis  is  an  increased burden on them.  So they hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, during this economic slowdown, would give them  more\r\n\r\ntax  rebates in order to lighten their burden, especially  those\r\n\r\nbusinessmen who fail in their business or those workers who have\r\n\r\nbeen  retrenched.   I  hope the Minister would  explain  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  why  such tax rebate has been reduced  by  5%.   If  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  understand the rationale for such a  reduction,  they\r\n\r\nwill support the Government's policy and be more united in order\r\n\r\nto work for a better future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a commercial and\r\n\r\nfinancial centre.  Our Government's policy has been to encourage\r\n\r\nour  local  enterprises to be more enterprising.   At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  attract  foreign investors to come here  and  invest.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the  twin engines for our growth.   This  year,  our\r\n\r\nbudget  has  provided  for certain beneficial  measures  to  the\r\n\r\nfinancial   and  property  sectors,  so  that  they   can   grow\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  even  in  the  midst  of  a  financial   crisis.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  is  little assistance for  the  industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial  enterprises.   Because  of  the  regional  financial\r\n\r\nturmoil  and  the slowdown in the economy, many  companies  have\r\n\r\nreceived  less orders from the region.  However, their  cost  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  has  not come down.  Therefore, these   companies  are\r\n\r\nfaced with dwindling orders and they have cash flow problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce's survey,\r\n\r\nabout  54%  of the companies said that their business  has  been\r\n\r\naffected and about 45% of the companies said that they are faced\r\n\r\nwith  cash flow problems.  In order to help these businesses  to\r\n\r\ntide over this period, I would recommend certain measures to the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   First, the JTC and HDB should consider  curtailing\r\n\r\ntheir rental on land and factories to reduce their cost of doing\r\n\r\nbusiness.  At present, JTC and HDB rental is based on the rental\r\n\r\nthey  formulated three years ago when times were good,  the  so-called  market rental.  But in the present situation, the market\r\n\r\nrental has gone down.  For example, the tender\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprices  for the two pieces of land offered for sale by URA  have\r\n\r\ngone   down  by  many  times  as  compared  to  those  in  1996.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  during  this critical period, the Government  should\r\n\r\nadjust  the rental for land and factory spaces, so that  a  more\r\n\r\nreasonable rental could be formulated.  I suggest that  JTC  and\r\n\r\nHDB  should consider reducing rental by 10% for two  years.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way, they could directly help to bring down business  cost\r\n\r\nin order to enhance their competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they should liberalise the subletting of factory\r\n\r\nspace.   During an economic recession, many tenants need  lesser\r\n\r\nfactory  space.    Therefore,  the authorities  should  consider\r\n\r\nletting  these tenants to have more flexibility to sublet  their\r\n\r\nfactory  spaces in order that the usage of their  factory  space\r\n\r\ncould  be  maximised.   This will also  reduce  their  operating\r\n\r\nexpenses, and more optimum use can be made use of such space and\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I suggest that JTC and HDB should consider\r\n\r\nincreasing the ratio for subletting from 50% to 75%.   This will\r\n\r\neffectively help the tenants to tide over this period  and  also\r\n\r\nhelp those who want to launch new businesses to find the factory\r\n\r\nspace.  This will provide good opportunities for those  who  are\r\n\r\ninterested in entering  the manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Finance would consider my\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, much\r\n\r\nhas  been  said  about the regional currency  turmoil  that  has\r\n\r\nresulted in the slowdown of economic growth in virtually all the\r\n\r\ncountries  in South East Asia.  The Finance Minister is  prudent\r\n\r\nto  refrain from forecasting growth for Singapore or,  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter, for other countries in the region.  We are, I think,  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  agreement, save for a few other Members in this  House,\r\n\r\nthat, at best, things are likely to remain bad and they may  get\r\n\r\nworse.  There is little doubt in my mind that we are heading for\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  times for at least the  next  1-2  years.   The\r\n\r\nquestion is not so much whether there is going to be a recession\r\n\r\nnow, but how deep it will be and what our responses should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time we had a recession was in 1985. At that\r\n\r\ntime,  the  regional economies were growing well.  We  ourselves\r\n\r\nwere  plagued by high costs caused partly by the necessary  move\r\n\r\nto  higher technology industries and a tight labour force.  Once\r\n\r\nwe  have  improved our competitiveness and set the  fundamentals\r\n\r\nright,  we  were  able  to get out of the  recession  relatively\r\n\r\nunscathed.  There were no drastic retrenchments and no  loss  in\r\n\r\nreal income.  For the next decade, we were able to capitalise on\r\n\r\nthe  boom times in the region, especially with the emergence  of\r\n\r\nChina as an economic power and the revival of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time round, the issues are different. The currency\r\n\r\nturmoil  and  other difficulties have caused a loss of  investor\r\n\r\nconfidence  that has affected investment flows  into  the  whole\r\n\r\nregion.  Countries have to battle against the difficult task  of\r\n\r\nreviving  their  economies to create jobs.  They  also  have  to\r\n\r\ntackle  the  prospect  of  increasing  inflation  and  for  some\r\n\r\ncountries,  even shortages of essential foodstuff and materials.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, we cannot depend on the region as  we  did  in\r\n\r\n1985.   Even  if we manage to retain and sharpen our fundamental\r\n\r\nstrengths, we cannot escape the adverse effects of recession  in\r\n\r\nthe region.  Take the simple example of tourism.  A great number\r\n\r\nof tourists originate from the other ASEAN countries.  We should\r\n\r\nbe  lucky if half the number who visited Singapore show up  this\r\n\r\nyear.   With  recession in these countries and their depreciated\r\n\r\ncurrencies, we cannot really blame them for not coming.  Tourist\r\n\r\narrivals are likely to fall sharply this year, maybe as much  as\r\n\r\ndouble  digit.  And if the haze comes a bit earlier  this  year,\r\n\r\nthe  drop  may be more precipitous.  This will have  a  rippling\r\n\r\neffect  on  the retail sector that depends on tourism, including\r\n\r\nhotels,  restaurants, shopping centres and  transport  services.\r\n\r\nTaxi drivers are going to find fewer fares.  This fall in demand\r\n\r\nis  not  likely to be compensated by Singaporeans who will  also\r\n\r\ntighten  their belts.  Even if we cut prices for these services,\r\n\r\nthere  may  not  be sufficient customers.  The effects  of  this\r\n\r\nslowdown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  permeate to a wide cross-section of our economy.  Everyone\r\n\r\nwill in one way or another be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be our response then? It is fair to say that\r\n\r\nwe  in Singapore have been having it good for many years.   High\r\n\r\neconomic  growth has translated into rapid rise in  real  income\r\n\r\nand  better  well-being for everyone.  The Government  has  been\r\n\r\nable  to  record surpluses every year in the past  decade.   The\r\n\r\ntimes  are so good that many Members in this House have remarked\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  making too much money.  Our people's expectations\r\n\r\nhave also soared at the same time. HDB flats have now given  way\r\n\r\nto  Executive Condominiums and private condominiums in districts\r\n\r\n9,  10 and 11.  IUPs are not quite enough.  Our people want more\r\n\r\nMUPs.   On  the  whole, our people's tolerance  level  has  also\r\n\r\nlowered.   At  the  slightest  inconvenience,  there   will   be\r\n\r\ncomplaints  to  the  MPs  and to the press.   Increasingly,  our\r\n\r\npeople  are  beginning to think of themselves  rather  than  the\r\n\r\ncommunity as a whole.  Many of our young and successful citizens\r\n\r\nare  coming  to the view that it is their right to be  rich  and\r\n\r\npowerful,  without  realising that  their  ascent  to  fame  and\r\n\r\nfortune  has been helped by the nation's progress with  everyone\r\n\r\npitching in their effort.  More important, just as dinners  will\r\n\r\nnot  last  forever,  good times too would  not  last.   We  must\r\n\r\nprepare  ourselves  for the ups and downs that  will  inevitably\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we should first look at what we ourselves can do\r\n\r\nrather  than just asking the Government for more hand-outs.   It\r\n\r\nwould  be reasonable for us to do so if we have been responsible\r\n\r\nfor   the  slowdown  as  in  1985.   The  present  problems  are\r\n\r\nexternally  generated  and  in many instances  are  out  of  our\r\n\r\ncontrol.   It  comes with the ups and downs of business  cycles,\r\n\r\nalthough much of the present problems are man made.  There is  a\r\n\r\nChinese  saying  that \"when the horse dies, get off  and  walk.\"\r\n\r\nThere  is nothing we can do if we  stay on the horse, especially\r\n\r\nif it is a dead one.  If we look back the last 30 years, this is\r\n\r\nprecisely  what the Government and our people did  when  we  got\r\n\r\ninto  trouble.  We did not ask for charity.  Instead, we adapted\r\n\r\nourselves to the situation at hand and made adjustments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  running  away  from  the  painful  effects  of  a\r\n\r\nrecession.   This  time  round, the recession  is  going  to  be\r\n\r\npainful.   Those  of  us who lived through some  recessions  can\r\n\r\nvouch  for  the  fact that in certain cases,  the  pain  can  be\r\n\r\nconsiderable.   However,  if we are strong  and  have  a  higher\r\n\r\nthreshold  of  pain,  we  will be able  to  survive  and  become\r\n\r\nstronger.  The question now before us is: are we prepared?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sustained economic growth for the past two decades,\r\n\r\nallowing  for  the minor setback in 1985, may  have  lulled  our\r\n\r\ncitizens,  especially the younger ones among  us  who  have  not\r\n\r\nlived   through   recessions,  into  believing   that   economic\r\n\r\nprosperity will go on forever.  The good times that we have been\r\n\r\nhaving   have   lowered  the  threshold  of  pain  considerably.\r\n\r\nContinued success has also bred individualism, selfishness  and,\r\n\r\nworse,  greed.   We  can find examples of these  traits  in  the\r\n\r\nworking  places,  restaurants, shopping centres  and  even  golf\r\n\r\ncourses.   The  arrogance with which some young  and  successful\r\n\r\npeople flaunt their wealth and power is evident in the way  they\r\n\r\nspend  and the way they treat those who serve them.  I was  told\r\n\r\nof an incident in which a member of an exclusive golf club, when\r\n\r\nhe  failed to get satisfactory service from the waiter, reminded\r\n\r\nthe latter in no uncertain terms that he had paid a princely sum\r\n\r\nto  join  the  golf club and expected that he should  be  served\r\n\r\nproperly.   In  another incident, a member of a golf  club  took\r\n\r\nlegal action to intimidate the club on a very minor disagreement\r\n\r\nbecause he thought that it was a \"matter of principle.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower threshold of pain will see our people yelling for\r\n\r\nblue  murder  when  conditions deteriorate just  a  little  bit.\r\n\r\nWorse,  it may lead to panic and recourse to expedient  measures\r\n\r\nthat  will  not solve the longer term problems. The attitude  of\r\n\r\n\"every man for himself\" will erode community's ability to  fight\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to brace ourselves for the difficult times ahead.\r\n\r\nWe  must  increase our threshold of pain to ensure that  we  can\r\n\r\npull through and become fitter and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrimmer  at  the  end  of  these bad  times.   Given  our  sound\r\n\r\nfundamentals,  we  should be able to achieve  this  target.   By\r\n\r\nworking  together, we can face the problems  head  on  and  seek\r\n\r\nstrength through unity of purpose.  In doing so, there  will  be\r\n\r\nthose  amongst us who are weaker and will need help.  We  should\r\n\r\nextend  all  possible  assistance to help them  tide  over  this\r\n\r\ndifficult  period.   This help should not  only  come  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  but also come from those of us who are in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to  help.    I  would  especially  urge  our   younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  those successful ones, to help our  country  sail\r\n\r\nthrough  these difficulties.  For those who may be afflicted  by\r\n\r\nthe symptoms I have mentioned, I hope there will be a change  of\r\n\r\nmindset  so  that  they  can  work together  with  their  fellow\r\n\r\ncountrymen.  For those who are not, I can only appeal to them to\r\n\r\ncontinue  their good work and reinforce their fine efforts.   In\r\n\r\nthe coming months, we will need to work even closer together and\r\n\r\nsurvive  the  storms that will surely and inevitably  sweep  our\r\n\r\nshores.  I appeal once again to all our fellow citizens, let  us\r\n\r\nstay tight together and overcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  has allowed companies  to  claim  double  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction  for  approved  relocation  and  recruitment  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred  in  the hiring of talents from abroad so  as  to  help\r\n\r\noffset the extra costs which these companies will have to  incur\r\n\r\nin  employing  such  talent to supplement our  local  workforce.\r\n\r\nSuch  a policy move is indeed encouraging.  As mentioned by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister at last year's National Day Rally, human talent,\r\n\r\nwhether  in  the form of new immigrants or foreign nationals  on\r\n\r\nwork-stints  of a few years, will be the key factor in  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat Singapore stays economically competitive and successful  in\r\n\r\nthis  information  age.  While I do believe that  the  budgetary\r\n\r\ninitiative  will undoubtedly strengthen the positive factors  in\r\n\r\nattracting foreign talent, I would like to put forward, for  the\r\n\r\nMinister's consideration, a few additional points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of the double tax deduction scheme primarily\r\n\r\naccrue to companies which recruit overseas talents, I would like\r\n\r\nto suggest that assistance should also be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrendered  to the talents themselves.  As such, I would  propose,\r\n\r\nfirstly, that a unit, known as Foreign Talent Unit, be set up in\r\n\r\nthe  newly  named  Ministry of Manpower to centralise,  develop,\r\n\r\nimplement  and  oversee Government policies  pertaining  to  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of  overseas  talent.   This  unit  should   gather\r\n\r\ninformation  and  feedback  from  foreign  nationals   currently\r\n\r\nworking  in  Singapore so that we can tap upon their experience,\r\n\r\nand  understand  from  them  the particularistic  problems  that\r\n\r\nnationals from particular countries face when working and living\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   This  unit will serve  as  a  nerve  centre  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate what I believe must be a multi-pronged approach,  and\r\n\r\nwhich  will  necessarily involve both Governmental institutions,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  HDB  and  our  schools,  and  private  companies   and\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major difficulties faced by foreign nationals working\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  are  most  importantly  housing,  and  thereafter\r\n\r\nschooling  for their children.  Housing is expensive  here,  and\r\n\r\nrentals  high.  The Government has already worked out  a  scheme\r\n\r\nfor  JTC to buy and own a stock of HDB flats which are to be let\r\n\r\nout  entirely to foreigners.  This will certainly alleviate  the\r\n\r\nhousing problem to some extent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to schooling, the problem has not been totally\r\n\r\nsolved.    High-ranking  expatriate  staff  have  the  schooling\r\n\r\nexpenses  of  their  children paid  on  their  behalf  by  their\r\n\r\nemployers.   However,  middle management expatriate  staff  will\r\n\r\nhave to bear such expenses themselves, and many are not able  to\r\n\r\nafford   the   fees  charged  by  international  schools.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment should, through assistance offered by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation,  encourage them to send their  children  to  a  local\r\n\r\nschool  instead, and special arrangements can then be  made  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children to continue learning their own languages, be  it\r\n\r\nGerman,  French  or Tamil. Moreover, a small number  of  foreign\r\n\r\nchildren  studying  in  our schools will  also  promote  greater\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  foreign cultures and  facilitate  interaction\r\n\r\nbetween our students and those from other countries.  This  will\r\n\r\nbe beneficial in broadening the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontacts  and  outlook  of  both parties,  and  in  the  process\r\n\r\nenriching the educational experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Talent Unit should also selectively screen and\r\n\r\nentice qualified expatriates and skilled labour from overseas to\r\n\r\nbecome  immigrants.  This will add to the pool  of  skilled  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  labour here, a favourable development  which  will\r\n\r\nenhance the quality of our workforce and strengthen our economic\r\n\r\nfundamentals  on  a  permanent basis.  However,  the  successful\r\n\r\nintegration of new immigrants into our society will  be  a  pre-requisite  before  their inherent potential  can  be  unleashed.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the Government should tap on the resources  of  both\r\n\r\nGovernmental  institutions  and private  enterprises  to  render\r\n\r\nadequate assistance to immigrants to enable them to adapt better\r\n\r\nto   local  working  conditions  and,  more  generally,  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore way of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are trying to attract foreign nationals to work in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  should  not lose sight of Singaporeans  who  are\r\n\r\nstaying  overseas.  For one reason or another, some Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmay  choose to work overseas and they form a part of our  useful\r\n\r\noverseas  network.  However, some of them may wish to return  in\r\n\r\nthe future, and we should attempt to make it easier for them  to\r\n\r\nreintegrate  into  our  community.  In this  instance,  suitable\r\n\r\ninitiatives that can be considered include special assistance to\r\n\r\nenable  them  to purchase HDB flats and efforts  to  ease  their\r\n\r\nchildren back into the Singapore education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all aware that a high quality workforce is the only\r\n\r\ntangible  resource Singapore possesses.  Hence, we  have  to  do\r\n\r\nmanpower  planning  carefully to satisfy our  future  needs.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  support  the  Minister's proposal  to  introduce  the\r\n\r\ndouble tax deduction scheme in connection with the recruiting of\r\n\r\noverseas  talent and hope that the Government will  consider  as\r\n\r\nwell the suggestions that have been put forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the motion moved by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would first like to compliment the Finance Minister  on\r\n\r\nthe prudence with which the Budget was assembled. There is merit\r\n\r\nin  conservatism in times of uncertainty and there is  merit  in\r\n\r\nensuring the Budget reflects consistency at the policy level.  I\r\n\r\nfully   support  the  measures  introduced  to  facilitate   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the financial services sector as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nrange  of  rebates to help lower income families.  However,  the\r\n\r\nmarket  reacted unenthusiastically in the following  days  after\r\n\r\nthe  Budget announcement.  The corporate world appears to  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  Budget is insufficient for these trying times.   Many\r\n\r\nindividuals  are  also disappointed in that the  current  Budget\r\n\r\noffers  only  5%  personal  income tax  rebate  across-the-board\r\n\r\ncompared  to  last year's 10% in the face of the most  turbulent\r\n\r\nyears since confrontation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to reason out why the public reacted this\r\n\r\nway.  I would think that since the Budget has to be presented in\r\n\r\nlate  February,  it is understandable that the Finance  Ministry\r\n\r\nwould  have  used information that was good up  to  the  end  of\r\n\r\nDecember.   But  if  it is so, it happens that  the  significant\r\n\r\neconomic events that affected our economy took place in  January\r\n\r\nand  February this year.  So the important question is:  is  the\r\n\r\nBudget catering to our current needs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I would like to raise today correlates to\r\n\r\nthe questions I posed in the last two parliamentary sittings  on\r\n\r\nthe  loan  exposures  of  local  institutions  to  the  regional\r\n\r\neconomies.   In his reply to my query in January, DPM  Lee  said\r\n\r\nthat the local banks' exposure to the region was small.  Then in\r\n\r\nFebruary, we were updated with the report that the local  banks'\r\n\r\nexposure  to the region has increased and that had not  affected\r\n\r\nour  banking system much.   Yet, in the last few days, barely  a\r\n\r\nmonth  from  the  second report, Tat Lee  Bank  announced  heavy\r\n\r\nlosses  to the point that an unprecedented move by the  MAS  was\r\n\r\nneeded  to allow Tat Lee Bank to re-value its assets in order to\r\n\r\nshore  up its balance sheets.  Most of the other big four  banks\r\n\r\nhave  also reported huge provision for losses.  To top that,  we\r\n\r\nhave heard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial  reports  of  banks  across  the  causeway  sustaining\r\n\r\nmassive losses.  All these reports show that local banks with an\r\n\r\nexposure of more than $20 billion to Malaysian businesses may go\r\n\r\non to suffer more and more losses in the coming months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sums up my concern for the timeliness of information\r\n\r\nused  in  these fast changing economic times.  It is  only  with\r\n\r\ntimely and accurate information that we can react fast.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  public's  lack-lustre response to the  Budget  announcement\r\n\r\nsends  the  message  that the Government is  not  reacting  fast\r\n\r\nenough  and  not  providing the leadership that the  people  are\r\n\r\nyearning for in this crisis.  I think the Government can do more\r\n\r\nthis  time  by  stimulating the economy with a more expansionary\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been reported by many Members of this House that a\r\n\r\nsurvey  conducted by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce shows  that\r\n\r\nmore  than  50% of its members have been affected badly  by  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.  Many complained about credit squeeze and the high  cost\r\n\r\nof  running business.  Yet other than the LEFS Scheme, no  other\r\n\r\nsignificant  measures have been introduced in  this  regard.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to call on the Government to work closely  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  trade associations to feel the pulse and the health  of\r\n\r\nthe  local enterprises and, at this point, I would like to  echo\r\n\r\nMr  Leong's call for the pre-Budget consultations to take  place\r\n\r\nin the next Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I remind the House that for years the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance  in  Japan has reacted slowly to their growing  economic\r\n\r\nproblems.    Now  it  seems  that  it  has  become  increasingly\r\n\r\ndifficult for Japan to propel itself to full recovery.   I  only\r\n\r\nhope that we would not go the same way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister not to allow the current economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties to deflect our long term infrastructure development\r\n\r\nplans  and,  hopefully, it would not affect the construction  of\r\n\r\nour  underground road system and the facilities needed  to  push\r\n\r\nour vital economic sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

As a result, they operate as labour suppliers\r\n\r\nand  bring  in foreign workers, receive commission,  default  on\r\n\r\nlevy  payments and even abandon the workers, resulting in a host\r\n\r\nof social problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stem this abuse, the Ministry had decided in December\r\n\r\n1997  to refer subcontractors' work permit applications to  main\r\n\r\ncontractors  for verification and hold main contractors  jointly\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  any workers abandoned by their subcontractors.\r\n\r\nThis   encouraged   main   contractors   to   scrutinise   their\r\n\r\nsubcontractors'  work permit applications.  It  also  emphasised\r\n\r\nthe  important  role of main contractors to  ensure  the  proper\r\n\r\nemployment   of   foreign   construction   workers   by    their\r\n\r\nsubcontractors.  The measure has met with some  success.   Since\r\n\r\nits  implementation,  approximately 25% of  the  subcontractors'\r\n\r\napplications  had  not been endorsed by main  contractors.   The\r\n\r\nmain contractors' involvement has helped to reduce the incidence\r\n\r\nof abuse to some extent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once foreign workers are brought in by the subcontractors\r\n\r\non  the support of main contractors, the subcontractors and main\r\n\r\ncontractors  would  be  accountable for  the  accommodation  and\r\n\r\nplacements  of  foreign  workers  should  they  be  subsequently\r\n\r\ndisplaced.  Main contractors have the resources to house workers\r\n\r\nabandoned  by their subcontractors, or transfer their employment\r\n\r\nto  other  subcontractors within the same project  or  in  other\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus not true that main contractors have no control over\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  workers  employed by  the  subcontractors.   These\r\n\r\nforeign workers were brought in to work on their projects in the\r\n\r\nfirst  instance.  Therefore, requiring main contractors to share\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility with their subcontractors  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\navoid abuses and illegal practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SWIMMING AND LIFE-SAVING LESSONS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education (a) how\r\n\r\nmany  schools conduct swimming and life-saving lessons for their\r\n\r\npupils; (b) how frequent these lessons are conducted and what is\r\n\r\nthe duration of each lesson; and (c) whether there are any tests\r\n\r\nof proficiency for these lessons.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swimming is not a compulsory component of the Physical\r\n\r\nEducation  (PE)  syllabus.  However, schools are  encouraged  to\r\n\r\nconduct various forms of swimming programmes for their pupils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently only six schools (one junior college, four\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools and one primary school) have swimming  pools.\r\n\r\nThese  schools conduct swimming lessons during the  PE  lessons.\r\n\r\nSchools   situated  near  public  swimming  pools  also  conduct\r\n\r\nswimming lessons.  Simple rescue techniques, but not lifesaving,\r\n\r\nis taught as part of the swimming programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These swimming lessons are usually conducted once a week\r\n\r\nfor  10 weeks.  Each lesson is of about 45 minutes' duration and\r\n\r\npupils may take a proficiency test at the end of the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the primary level, most schools conduct the Learn-to-Swim programme for their P4 and P6 pupils after the P4 streaming\r\n\r\nexamination and after the PSLE respectively.  This programme  is\r\n\r\nfor beginners and consists of 12 swimming lessons.  Each lesson,\r\n\r\nwhich  is conducted during curriculum time, lasts for  about  45\r\n\r\nminutes. Pupils generally take a proficiency test at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe programme.  From 1994 to 1997, a total of 44,800 pupils took\r\n\r\npart  in the programme. The number of schools involved each year\r\n\r\nranges from 90 to 124.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from swimming done as an element in the PE\r\n\r\nlessons, swimming is also promoted in the school ECA  programme.\r\n\r\nPresently,  145  primary school (74%) and 70  secondary  schools\r\n\r\n(43%)  have swimming in their ECA.  In 1997 alone,  about 20,000\r\n\r\npupils  received the National Swimming Survival Award  conducted\r\n\r\nby  the Singapore Sports Council. While pupils are taught simple\r\n\r\nrescue techniques as part of the PE programme, lifesaving is not\r\n\r\nincluded in the syllabus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TERTIARY COURSES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Education whether\r\n\r\nhis   Ministry   has  any  accreditation  system  or   licensing\r\n\r\nrequirements to control the quality of full-time, part-time  and\r\n\r\ndistance   learning  tertiary  courses  (diploma,   degree   and\r\n\r\npostgraduate  programmes) conducted by private  institutions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different overseas tertiary institutions\r\n\r\noffering a wide variety of courses of study in Singapore.
