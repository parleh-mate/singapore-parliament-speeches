Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB records show that from 2003 to June 2007, there are about 11,500 first-time buyers of HDB flats who chose not to take a concessionary loan from HDB, but instead opted for a mortgage loan from commercial banks at market interest rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 3%, or 320, of these cases faced difficulties in servicing their bank loans and had to give up their flats in mortgagee sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;Flat buyers who take bank loans to finance their flats are informed that they would be subject to the mortgage financing policies of the banks.&nbsp; Banks have their own financial assistance measures.&nbsp; Mortgagors who have problems servicing their bank loans should approach their banks for help.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 320 cases whose flats were repossessed by the banks, they have generally been able to find alternative accommodation on their own.&nbsp; In a small number of cases, about 30, HDB has acceded to their appeals to be allocated a HDB rental flat, in view of their extenuating circumstances.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Apart from that, many flat buyers rely on their housing agents to help them with flat purchases.&nbsp; One of the most important things is to make sure that housing agents also play their role in informing their clients with regard to information that is relevant to them, whether they are eligible for loans and grants, and so on.&nbsp; What is important is for the flat buyers, apart from getting all this information, to make informed decisions with regard to what they are capable of buying.&nbsp; We always encourage financial prudence to make sure that they buy within their means.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has also put in place several measures.&nbsp; So when&nbsp;flat buyers first come in, at the point of first appointment, HDB officers will look through a checklist and make sure that&nbsp;flat buyers are aware of their eligibility and that they are informed of what are their eligibility as far as loans are concerned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to why they choose bank loans, it is market forces, independent of what they choose to take up.&nbsp; At some point, the market rates given by the banks are a lot more attractive.&nbsp; So we leave it to the flat buyers to make the decision, so long as we make sure that they have made their decisions with the relevant information that is being given to them.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The most important lesson for flat buyers is to make sure that they understand the commitment that they have made with the banks.&nbsp; They are aware as to what are the obligations they have when they take on the bank loans.&nbsp; Like I mentioned in my earlier reply, the banks have got their own financial assistance measures.&nbsp; They should go back to the banks and try to get assistance from the banks.&nbsp; As far as possible, HDB will try to help those who are really in financial difficulties.&nbsp; Sometimes, we assist them.&nbsp; We waive the minimum occupation period for them to sell their flat to resolve some of their issues.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, it is not wise for HDB to take over loans that are not well serviced by the banks.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I think we have discussed this policy before.&nbsp; By and large, the assumption behind the policy is one where we want to encourage upgraders.&nbsp; So, first-time buyers are eligible for a concessionary loan and, as they improve their lives, we want to encourage them to upgrade, and therefore we facilitate their upgrading with another concessionary loan.&nbsp; However, we understand that downgraders may require certain assistance.&nbsp; But not all downgraders require financial assistance.&nbsp; This is because sometimes when they monetise or sell their assets, they do make sufficient proceeds, and we believe that the proceeds are sufficient for them to purchase a smaller flat.&nbsp; For cases that require assistance, HDB will look at them on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; But we want to discourage people from downgrading, making proceeds from the downgrading, and then getting another concessionary loan, because these are subsidised loans from the Government.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:PURCHASE OF HDB FLATS--><p align=left>Column: 1178<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:PURCHASE OF HDB FLATS:::1181--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Those who do not qualify for concessionary loans include private property owners, high-income households, non-citizen households, those who have previously taken&nbsp;two HDB loans, as well as those who have already enjoyed one concessionary loan and are not upgrading in their current flat purchase.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a wide variety of commercial loan packages available in the market.&nbsp; Generally, HDB flat buyers who have a stable household income and are buying a flat within their means should be able to secure a bank loan to finance their flat purchase.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is a small group of flat buyers who are unable to secure a bank loan for various reasons, even though they may have the financial means to service a mortgage at commercial rates.&nbsp; They include those with poor credit histories or are undischarged bankrupts.&nbsp; To help meet the needs of this group of flat buyers, HDB has recently implemented an assistance measure to provide them with mortgage loans at commercial interest rates.&nbsp; As with other HDB loans, credit assessment will be applied to ensure financial prudence on the part of the flat buyer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to clarify and emphasise that HDB is not re-introducing market rate loans as a mortgage financing option for flat buyers.&nbsp; This is a limited assistance measure extended to a select group of buyers who face difficulty in obtaining a bank loan to finance their flat purchase.&nbsp; HDB will assess appeals for these loans on a case-by-case basis, and we reserve the right to reject cases that do not meet our guidelines.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

HDB will expedite such appeal cases.&nbsp; But, fundamentally, we would like, as much as possible, to encourage these buyers to explore the commercial market first.&nbsp; As I have clarified, it is not HDB's intention to re-enter this market with a loan at market rate.&nbsp; We are only there to help very exceptional cases and, in most cases, we have to be thoroughly assessing the situation and we have to satisfy ourselves that indeed they do not have any access to the bank market before we grant a loan.&nbsp; Concessionary rate loans are heavily subsidised, especially if we think about it over the loan period.&nbsp; Therefore, we&nbsp;view these as a subsidy.&nbsp; For us to offer another loan at market rate is really just to help the very few cases who we think genuinely have problems with access to bank market to find financing for their home.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Not all downgraders are not given access to financial market.&nbsp; Many of them, despite the need to downgrade, can access the bank loan market and, therefore, should do so.&nbsp; I would say that what we are doing now is to limit to a very small subset that not only could be looking at downgrading as an option but, because of their past problems - it could be&nbsp;bad credit histories or that they may be involved in litigation - that has basically barred them from accessing the commercial loan market.&nbsp; So this is really a small subset.&nbsp; I agree with the hon.

In addition, MOE is encouraging the polytechnics to link up with Foreign Specialised Institutions to offer degree programmes in niche disciplines.&nbsp; For example, Ngee Ann Polytechnic has tied up with Wheelock College from the US to offer a degree programme in early childhood education, for which Wheelock has a strong reputation.&nbsp; These specialised degree programmes will provide our students with more opportunities to pursue university education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are progressively moving towards the current target of providing subsidised<p align=left>Column: 1183<p> university education for 25% of each cohort of local students.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As I mentioned in my reply, the polytechnics are also developing degree programmes in collaboration with specialised institutions that offer niche programmes that are in demand by the industry today in Singapore.&nbsp; I think we provide many routes of advancement for our students to realise their aspirations and to allow them to pursue their education opportunities.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MASS RAPID TRANSIT DOWNTOWN LINE--><p align=left>Column: 1186<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:MASS RAPID TRANSIT DOWNTOWN LINE:::1190--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>MASS RAPID TRANSIT DOWNTOWN LINE</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Expediting of construction--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Expediting of construction)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng</B> asked the Minister for Transport if the construction <p align=left>Column: 1187<p>of the MRT Downtown Line can be expedited.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6. <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B> asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether the Ministry will consider expediting the construction of the Bukit Timah corridor of the Downtown Line as 2015 is too long to wait for its completion; and (b) what are the criteria used in determining how the stations along this line will be located.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Transport (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, with your permission, can I take Question Nos. 5 and 6 together as they are related?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp; Yes.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is committed to ensuring the timely completion of the Downtown Line (DTL).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DTL is a 40-kilometres&nbsp;rail line that will connect the north-western and eastern areas of the island to the CBD and the Marina Bay area. It will be built in&nbsp;three stages. The first stage, or DTL 1, which serves the new developments in the Marina Bay, such as the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort and the new Marina Bay Financial Centre, is targeted for completion in 2013.&nbsp; The second stage, serving the Bukit Timah corridor and Bukit Panjang area, is scheduled for completion in 2015.&nbsp; The final stage, which serves areas such as Bedok Reservoir and Tampines, is expected to be completed in 2018.&nbsp; By implementing the project in phases, commuters can enjoy the benefits of the DTL even before the entire line is completed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In working out the implementation schedule, LTA took into account the need to meet strategic transport needs and <p align=left>Column: 1188<p>demand as well as economic and financial viability considerations. The scheduling of the project also took into account the scale and complexity of the project as well as the resources required to manage and execute the project safely. The DTL is the longest underground rail project to date and runs through built-up corridors.&nbsp; LTA has already started preparatory work for the first two stages of DTL.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to how the locations of the stations are determined, LTA takes into consideration the need to maximise the stations' accessibility and connectivity to population and employment centres.&nbsp; Where feasible, interchanges will be built to link the DTL with existing RTS lines, to connect the DTL to the rest of the RTS network. Engineering requirements and site conditions also affect station locations. LTA is still in the process of finalising the details of station locations.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I understand from the Minister that the DTL will take up to&nbsp;2018 before final completion.

The Member pointed out that it takes up to 2018 to build a rail line, so what happens in the meantime. So where necessary, in a particular area, where it is getting very congested,&nbsp;we look towards increasing bus capacity. This could be in terms of increasing bus service frequencies or new bus routes, ie, new buses coming on stream.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 1189<p><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, we heard the Minister's explanation that it depends on scale, complexity and various other reasons in determining the schedule.&nbsp; But I think the Minister has still not directly answered the question why the building of the line cannot be hastened. I hope the Minister will&nbsp; answer that question.&nbsp; My second point is whether the Ministry will also take into account when it constructs the MRT line, how to also ensure connectivity to the other transport contact points, ie, the buses and other public transport amenities, because this is always a perennial problem, that the lines are built but there is not much connection to the other public transport systems.

The answer is yes. This is what we will do. We will ensure that the DTL connects with the Compass line, which is the present,&nbsp;East-West and the North-South lines and also the Circle Line that we are building.&nbsp;We will ensure that this is the case and, where possible, like she has said,&nbsp;with bus interchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her first question was:&nbsp; can we hasten it and bring it forward?&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do this as expeditiously as possible. As I have said, preparatory work has already started. Once the approval has been given by Cabinet, we have moved.&nbsp; So preliminary engineering works are done.&nbsp; But the scale and complexity is something that I think Members understand. This is the longest underground line that we are building.&nbsp; So, it is time-intensive. Even as we want to do it as fast as possible, because it goes through built-up areas, we have to minimise disruptions to traffic, and, over and above that, we have to ensure that we do it safely.&nbsp; So we are on the same page. We like to do it as fast as possible but we have to take into account these considerations.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the policy we take with regard to air transport&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1190<p>is an excellent one.&nbsp; Before Terminal 2 was actually chock-a-block, we started with Terminal 3 construction.

Retirement and healthcare needs will therefore correspondingly increase.&nbsp; However, only about 40% of current active CPF members turning 55 are able to meet their CPF Minimum Sum.&nbsp; So I think our priority should be to&nbsp;help members set aside more CPF savings in the future, instead of allowing withdrawals for&nbsp;expanded purposes.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy asked&nbsp;whether the CPF Education Scheme could be further liberalised.&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular scheme&nbsp;was introduced in 1989 and was a concession for the use of CPF monies and intentionally limited to only full-time local tertiary education courses at approved publicly funded tertiary institutions, because these&nbsp;are heavily subsidised by the Government.&nbsp; We have allowed it and we will continue to allow it.&nbsp; But even then, 13% of students who had borrowed from their parents' CPF accounts for tertiary education have not been able to pay the monies back despite CPF Board's enforcement efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to better prepare for the needs of an ageing population, we should not extend the use of CPF for more educational purposes. There are other existing avenues through which students can obtain financial assistance if they are needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The real issue is whether we should expand and allow more students to draw from their parents' accounts.&nbsp; I am sure there are very good reasons for that.&nbsp; Education is an investment and&nbsp;when the students get their university degrees, they will repay their parents.&nbsp; As I said, I do not argue with the positive aspects of having a high education.&nbsp; Our current challenge is an ageing population and&nbsp;smaller family sizes.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;the CPF Board and the Ministry of Manpower are actually the last gate.&nbsp; I am sure if the scheme is liberalised, most parents would, because they are good parents.&nbsp; I would rather act as that very firm gate-keeper, so that the parents' CPF funds are not depleted.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee</B>: Sir, first, let me say that it is not true that newly married foreign spouses are only granted Short Term Social Visit Passes and are unable to obtain long-term immigration facilities to remain in Singapore.&nbsp; A foreign spouse may apply for a Long Term Social Visit Pass (LTSVP) or permanent residence (PR) status and each application will be considered on its own merits.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last&nbsp;two years, on average, about 13,000 applications for Long Term Social Visit Passes for foreign spouses of Singaporeans and permanent residents were approved each year.&nbsp; There is no quota on such passes issued each year.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our immigration policies take into account the preservation of family unity, while striking a balance in ensuring that foreigners do not become a burden to the State.&nbsp; Generally, the Immigration&nbsp;and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will try to provide applicants with the reasons for rejection, to help them understand what they can do to improve their eligibility when they reapply.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the small percentage of foreign spouses who do not qualify for Long Term Social Visit Passes, ICA will consider granting a one-time extension of stay to allow them to seek legal employment so that they may remain in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in short, ICA's guidelines governing the grant of long-term immigration facilities to foreign spouses are sufficiently flexible and compassionate to allow deserving spouses to stay in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Dr Lam Pin Min's question, over the last&nbsp;five years, on average, about 2,700 foreign spouses of Singapore<p align=left>Column: 1195<p> citizens have been granted Singapore citizenship&nbsp;each year.&nbsp; For the same period, about 5,400 and 12,000 foreign spouses of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents were granted permanent residence&nbsp;status and Long Term Social Visit Passes respectively annually.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not know exactly why some foreign spouses do not apply to become Singapore citizens.&nbsp; Some of them may hail from countries more developed than Singapore, or still have roots in their native country.&nbsp; Some may also be retaining their foreign citizenship to enjoy certain privileges such as medical benefits or the eligibility to own property or businesses in their native country.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the Government, through the formation of the National Population Committee,&nbsp;chaired by DPM&nbsp;Wong Kan Seng, has been examining these issues and exploring how to attract and encourage foreigners who are suitable to take up PR status and Singapore citizenship.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (for the Minister for National Development)</B>:&nbsp; Mr<p align=left>Column: 1200<p> Speaker, Sir, AVA has put in place a comprehensive and integrated food safety system to ensure that food imported into Singapore is safe for human consumption.&nbsp; The system is science-based, and underpinned by constant vigilance to identify food safety problems as well as rigorous analysis of the potential hazards associated with the problems identified.&nbsp; Let me explain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consignments of imported food are subject to systematic inspection and laboratory monitoring for pathogens, contaminants and residues to ensure that the food products are safe for consumption.&nbsp; Such surveillance also enables AVA to maintain a database of useful information on the safety level of food originating from the different sources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AVA also keeps a close watch on the global food safety situation to ensure that our policies and control programmes stay current.&nbsp; Where there are specific or emerging concerns, AVA may introduce additional programmes or intensify checks, if necessary.&nbsp; These could include checks on the presence of banned substances or contaminants such as malachite green or Sudan red, or viruses like the avian flu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure the House that AVA maintains stringent checks on food imports from all sources, including China.&nbsp; AVA has a long working relationship with the regulatory authority in China, and Singapore's regulatory requirements and stringent checks on food imports are well known in China.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, AVA has provided regular feedback to the Chinese authorities to facilitate their monitoring of China's food exports to Singapore.&nbsp; This has resulted in general improvements in the safety of vegetables and farmed freshwater fishes imported from China.&nbsp;&nbsp; AVA will continue to remain vigilant to ensure the safety of food products<p align=left>Column: 1201<p> imported from all sources, including China, and intensify checks and controls, where necessary.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It cannot be complete.&nbsp; I am just wondering whether AVA actually&nbsp;goes abroad to inspect the source of the food.&nbsp; Secondly, does AVA collaborate with other like-minded agencies, such as the FDA of the US, and share database with like-minded organisations in Europe as well?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</B>&nbsp; Let me take the second question first.&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; AVA monitors the world's food health situation daily through relevant Internet websites.&nbsp; Food authorities from other countries as well as Australia and New Zealand also keep AVA informed of food recalls or other warnings of that nature.&nbsp; So the answer is, yes, we work very closely with all the different agencies from the different countries for food warnings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of surveillance and monitoring, I think there are different categories of food that AVA monitors.&nbsp; AVA accredits overseas meat establishments, for example, and processed egg establishments.&nbsp; So, as far as fresh food products are concerned, they accredited the food sources.&nbsp; There are two levels of accreditation: first,&nbsp;they assess the country's system in terms of the animal health and food safety.&nbsp; In that sense, animal disease status, for example, foot-and-mouth disease, bird flu, and other food system, microbiology, antibiotic residue control programmes, will be considered for evaluation.&nbsp; Once the country's system has been evaluated, then AVA will look into the specific establishments within the country.&nbsp; So, they go into the specific establishments to<p align=left>Column: 1202<p> assess their control measures to make sure that they are safe for exports.&nbsp; That is for fresh food and meat products.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For other products, like processed food, for example, the responsibility lies&nbsp;with the importers where high-risk food products such as&nbsp;preserved foods, vegetables, soya bean products, minimally-processed vegetables, flour, starches, and so on, are subjected to strict import control.&nbsp; So, importers of these products are required to submit documentary proof that they are from regulated sources and health certificates or laboratory reports to certify their safety. Also, samples are also collected for testing to ensure that these products comply with our food laws.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC TREES--><p align=left>Column: 1202<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC TREES:::1204--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC TREES</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11. <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B> asked the Minister for National Development in light of the recent incident when a tree in Bukit Batok Nature Park fell and killed a jogger, whether the National Parks Board has sufficient checks in place to ensure that trees planted in Singapore are well maintained and do not pose a risk to people.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien (for the Minister for National Development)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, NParks has sufficient checks in place to ensure that our trees do not pose a safety hazard to the public.&nbsp; Its team of arborists undertakes a rigorous tree inspection regime to ensure the health and condition of the trees under NParks' charge.&nbsp; With the help of the latest technology, the arborists are able to detect conditions such as cavities and decay that are not visible to the eyes.&nbsp; They also prune our trees regularly to remove weak, dry or overgrown branches.&nbsp; This reduces the weight of foliage in the tree crown and improves stability.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NParks has benchmarked its tree expertise against international best<p align=left>Column: 1203<p> practices.&nbsp; Its arborists are certified under a curriculum set by the International Society of Arboriculture.&nbsp; NParks offers the same certification to tree care professionals in the private sector and other public agencies.&nbsp; NParks also advises public agencies and other land owners on tree-care standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NParks' tree maintenance programme has reaped positive results over the years.&nbsp; It currently maintains more than one million trees along roadsides, in parks and on vacant lands.&nbsp; The annual number of fallen trees and branches has reduced considerably from about 4,000 in year 2000 to about 1,000 in 2006.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is not possible to eliminate tree-related accidents altogether.&nbsp; While tree diseases can be diagnosed and brought under control, there are elements of nature that are beyond our control.&nbsp; The recent incidents at the Bukit Batok Nature Park and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve were cases in point.&nbsp; The incidents were caused by a combination of strong winds and heavy rain.&nbsp; In addition, it is also a challenge to maintain trees in nature areas because of limited accessibility and the need to strike a balance with conservation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NParks will continue to improve its tree maintenance programme.&nbsp; It will take measures to increase public awareness on avoiding forested areas during inclement weather.&nbsp; It will also look into additional safety measures, such as increasing the number of rain shelters and instituting periodic closing of trails for maintenance.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B>:&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister of State, when there are strong winds and heavy rain during such periods and the soil around the trees is loosened,&nbsp;whether additional checks are being done by NParks and also what precautions are then given to residents<p align=left>Column: 1204<p> and passers-by when they come close to such trees.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</B>:&nbsp; NParks has a regular programme on checking the trees.&nbsp; Where periods of continuous rainfall or strong winds have happened, we have also taken measures to close the nature park, if necessary.

First of all, the operator would have to brief the kayakers on the dos and don'ts when in the water, and of course they have to help them&nbsp;put on the life vests,&nbsp;they have to inform them that they have to make sure that the life vests have to be on at all times as well as&nbsp;they have to stay within the designated area which is&nbsp;clearly demarcated.&nbsp; In addition, the operators&nbsp;on shore also have binoculars,&nbsp;whistles,&nbsp;air horns, and so on, <p align=left>Column: 1208<p>to alert kayakers if they see them straying out of the designated kayaking area.&nbsp; But I think, ultimately, the responsibility to ensure the safety of the users really lies upon themselves.&nbsp; They have to exercise individual responsibility.&nbsp; They have to adhere to the rules and make sure that, when in the water, they do not take any action which will endanger their lives.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

These include introducing wheelchair accessible buses, making our MRT stations barrier-free, and implementing barrier-free routes within 400 metres radius of all MRT stations. Besides catering to the less mobile, these barrier-free routes also have decision tactiles and contrasting colour strips to guide the visually impaired at crossings and pedestrian overhead bridges. The bus stops, road kerbs and other road facilities are also being upgraded to enable senior citizens and others with mobility difficulties to get around more easily.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is crucial to put in the necessary infrastructure for the elderly and commuters with special needs, the support of other commuters is just as important. Hence, the public transport operators have regularly implemented public education initiatives, such as courtesy programmes, roadshows and school talks to promote gracious behaviour among commuters.&nbsp; For example, SBST and LTA launched a public education programme to seek commuters' understanding and patience when the bus driver helps wheelchair bound passengers to board and to alight from the buses.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, the LTA will continue to enhance our land transport system to meet the varied needs of the population as we move towards a more socially inclusive society.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> &nbsp; Sir, I applaud the Ministry and the public transport operators' messages to the commuting public to be patient and to accept that the disabled and the elderly have&nbsp;to integrate into society and to<p align=left>Column: 1213<p> participate actively.&nbsp; My supplementary question is whether our economy would be better served if,&nbsp;instead of enabling barrier-free accesses on the public transport network,&nbsp;we&nbsp;provide dedicated transport links or services&nbsp;reserved for the elderly and the disabled because the former would obviously come with a cost to&nbsp;the general economy, slowing down the public network for example.

If you look at, say, what the National Council for Social Services is doing, for instance, they provide various forms of assistance in terms of transport, eg, subsidies for contract&nbsp;buses to take care of some of these people.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is a balance.&nbsp;

Many of them participate actively in chatrooms and they listen frequently to podcasts.&nbsp; The pervasiveness of new media poses both an opportunity and a challenge for educators.&nbsp; MOE encourages our teachers to leverage on such technologies to make learning more interesting and engaging.&nbsp; At the same time, we have adopted proactive measures to ensure that our students are educated on the safe and responsible use of these technologies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools have integrated elements of cyber-wellness into the curriculum to build a strong cyber culture.&nbsp; The Civics and Moral Education syllabus for primary and secondary schools includes topics on Internet use and cyber-safety.&nbsp; The dangers of Internet Relay Chats are highlighted to them.&nbsp; The Social Emotional Learning framework that was launched in 2005 also helps students make responsible decisions and exercise self-control over their own behaviour and actions in real and virtual space.&nbsp; In the new English syllabus to be implemented in 2009, students will be formally required to evaluate the reliability of sources and to cite the information sources that they use.&nbsp; Internet content that is accessible within MOE and schools is also scanned to filter out websites with content that is not suitable for our students, such as those containing pornographic materials. &nbsp;Skills on the&nbsp;ethical and legal use of ICT are also included in the set of baseline ICT standards which all students need to acquire at the end of their primary and secondary education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some schools have introduced additional programmes to educate students on cyber-wellness and cyber-responsibility to help them better<p align=left>Column: 1220<p> understand the potential dangers of the use of this technology.&nbsp; For example, Ang Mo Kio Secondary has incorporated 11 lesson modules for all of its students into the Civics and Moral Education framework.&nbsp; These modules cover topics ranging from Internet addiction, cyber bullying, Internet gambling to intellectual property and hacking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools will continue to engage parents as partners in guiding our students on the use of new technologies.&nbsp; For example, many schools already leverage on existing Parent Support Groups to inform parents on the issues surrounding the use of new technologies, and to actively work with parents to monitor, supervise and advise their children.&nbsp; Schools, such as Junyuan Secondary, have also conducted workshops for parents on Internet gaming, blogging and instant messaging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On plans to help students without access to computers at home, all of our schools are provided with ICT grants for them to acquire a wide range of ICT resources to support their educational programmes, and schools are given the autonomy to use these funds to integrate ICT into their teaching and learning approaches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have&nbsp;taken steps to ensure that no student is disadvantaged because he has no computer at home.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, our schools provide free access to computers in open areas, eg, computer labs and school libraries, where students can use the computers after school hours to complete their assignments.&nbsp; In addition, some schools have notebook computers that are available on loan for students to use for assignments and research at home and in&nbsp;school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, schools have financial assistance schemes in place to help students from low-income families to acquire a home computer.&nbsp; The Infocomm<p align=left>Column: 1221<p> Development Authority (IDA) offers the NEU PC Plus Programme to help students from needy families to acquire personal computers.&nbsp; With this scheme, students can purchase a personal computer complete with three years of broadband access at a subsidised price of $285.&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor students can have their co-payment further subsidised by the Opportunity Fund.&nbsp; This means that, in some instances,&nbsp;they pay even less than $285.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FutureSchools@Singapore initiative leverages on ICT on a school-wide level to bring about more engaged learning for all our&nbsp;students in those schools.&nbsp; Like all schools, our&nbsp;FutureSchools will ensure that their needy students too will have access to ICT and be able to&nbsp;tap on the Opportunity Fund and other sources of funding to help them purchase computers for use at home where necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

During the Parliamentary sitting yesterday, after my main answer to Question Nos. 3 and 4, I responded to a supplementary question from Ms Sylvia Lim when she asked about the timing of the compensation offer to Mr Dickson Tan and whether the urgency was brought about by a threat of&nbsp;lawsuit against the Government.&nbsp; When I answered her, I said I did not have the detailed choronology&nbsp;on that aspect.&nbsp;[<I>Please see <p align=left>Column: 1222<p>report on 16th July 2007.**</I> ]&nbsp;Yesterday evening, I checked with officials from the Attorney-General's Chambers. The facts are that a letter was received by the Prisons from Mr Dickson Tan's mother on 30th May asking for compensation and an apology, and containing a threat of legal proceedings.&nbsp; However, I am informed that well before the receipt of the letter, in mid-April, the Attorney-General's Chambers and the Subordinate Courts had already been in discussion on what could be a fair settlement sum after the Attorney-General had ascertained that an error was made. At the end of April, the Attorney-General's Chambers liaised with the Prisons and Subordinate Courts to meet up with Mr Dickson Tan to discuss a settlement offer.&nbsp; As he would be released on Home Detention Scheme on 17th May, the Attorney-General's Chambers felt that it would be better to meet him after he was placed on Home Detention Scheme. Prisons then sought to arrange a meeting for the parties to meet.&nbsp; The Attorney-General's Chambers confirmed the date of the meeting to be on 5th June and the meeting took place then. This confirmation, Sir, was given before the Attorney-General's Chambers received the letter from Mr Dickson Tan's mother.</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">**Col. 1005, 16th July 2007.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:BILLS-->      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:COMMODITY TRADING (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 1222<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:COMMODITY TRADING (AMENDMENT) BILL:::1226--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>COMMODITY TRADING (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.07 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Objective</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commodity futures trading is currently regulated under the Commodity Trading Act (CTA) by IE Singapore, while financial futures trading is regulated by MAS under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and<p align=left>Column: 1223<p> the Financial Advisers Act (FAA).&nbsp; Accordingly, commodity futures and the associated markets, clearing facilities, brokers and advisers are regulated under the CTA while their equivalents in respect of financial futures are regulated under the SFA and FAA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As markets converge and institutions participate in both financial and commodity futures markets, the presence of multiple regulators increases regulatory costs.&nbsp; To enhance Singapore's business environment and streamline regulations, we propose that legislative amendments be made to transfer regulatory oversight of commodity futures trading from IE Singapore under the CTA, to MAS under the SFA and FAA. The consolidation of the regulation of financial and commodity futures under a single regulator, the MAS, is a strategic step that will facilitate Singapore's growth as a futures trading hub. This would streamline licensing and compliance procedures. For example, firms broking both commodity futures and financial futures would only need to hold a single licence from MAS, as opposed to the current requirement of obtaining two separate licences from MAS and IE Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IE Singapore and MAS have consulted the public and industry players on the proposed transfer of regulatory oversight. The feedback received indicated support for MAS to be the single regulator for futures trading activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Legislative amendments required to effect the transfer</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the CTA, SFA and FAA to effect the transfer of regulatory oversight of commodity futures, including the associated markets, clearing facilities, brokers and advisers, from IE Singapore under the CTA, to MAS under the SFA and the FAA. &nbsp;The key amendments include:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1224<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Removing all provisions in the CTA relating to commodity futures trading; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Amending the definition of \"commodity\" in the SFA and introducing a definition of \"commodity\" in the FAA such that commodity futures contracts currently regulated under the CTA will be regulated under the SFA and FAA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill also makes a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act to clarify that members of commodity futures markets can continue to qualify for tax incentives after the transfer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these amendments, commodity futures, the associated markets, clearing facilities, brokers and advisers will come within the regulatory ambit of the SFA and the FAA.&nbsp; This will achieve the objective of having a single regulatory framework for commodity futures and financial futures contracts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Transitional arrangements&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed changes will affect those entities and their representatives currently dealing in commodity futures.&nbsp; These include the Singapore Commodity Exchange Ltd (SICOM), SICOM's broking members and their representatives, as well as futures brokers and their representatives who have licences from both IE Singapore and MAS. Where appropriate, MAS will provide transitional arrangements to facilitate their smooth transfer from regulatory oversight under IE Singapore to MAS. To this end, the Bill includes consequential amendments to the SFA and the FAA that will empower MAS to prescribe transitional regulations for the transfer of oversight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Regulatory status of over-the-counter commodity derivatives and spot commodity contracts</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under present legislation, IE Singapore also has regulatory oversight of over-the-<p align=left>Column: 1225<p>counter (OTC) commodity derivatives and spot commodity contracts under the CTA. These were added to the scope of the CTA in 2001 and a licensing framework was introduced, to keep out bucket shops that defraud the public. The intention was not, however, to impede legitimate dealing in OTC commodity derivatives and commodity spot broking. To this end, IE Singapore has granted exemptions from the licensing requirement to <I>bona fide</I> players operating in institutional markets. As the current regime continues to serve its purpose, we do not propose any changes to the regulatory framework for OTC commodity derivatives and spot commodity contracts under the revised CTA. We will continue to monitor market developments and ensure that our regulatory regime is kept relevant and effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments under the Commodity Trading (Amendment) Bill are necessary to effect the transfer of regulatory oversight of commodities futures from the CTA to the SFA and FAA. This will consolidate regulation of commodities and financial futures trading under MAS. As a result, there will be a more efficient and streamlined regulatory framework under which trading players can operate and conduct their futures trading activities in Singapore. This demonstrates the commitment of the Singapore Government to continually enhance the business operating environment in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In our situation, unlike many other countries, we have&nbsp;left the practice of optometry and opticianry unregulated.&nbsp; This&nbsp;has been&nbsp;historical.&nbsp; But several&nbsp;years ago, the Health Ministry decided that we should bring the practice of optometry and opticianry under regulation and started to prepare the industry for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1994, we took the first major step when the Singapore Polytechnic launched a diploma course in optometry and certificate courses in ophthalmic dispensing.&nbsp; This was to provide the industry with well-trained optometrists and opticians to help raise the standard of eye care by these allied health professionals.&nbsp; Over the years, the Singapore Polytechnic has graduated about 600 optometrists and provided training for about 300 opticians.&nbsp; We now have an active market in such eye care practices with competitive prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1995, we took the second major step when the Contact Lens Practitioners<p align=left>Column: 1227<p> Act was introduced to regulate contact lens practice.&nbsp; This was a priority to ensure public safety by allowing only properly trained practitioners to fit and dispense contact lenses.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are now ready to take the third major step by bringing legislation to bear on the remaining practices of optometry and opticianry, which fall outside of the Contact Lens Practitioners&nbsp;Act.&nbsp; This is an important piece of legislation particularly because myopia is rather common in Singapore.&nbsp; Our prevalence rate for myopia is high at 40% among Chinese adult Singaporeans&nbsp;over 40 years old, as compared to, say, 15% among Australians and 27% among Americans in the same age group.&nbsp; The problem will grow as our population ages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several reasons why we need to regulate the practice of optometry and opticianry.&nbsp; First, the public will then be better assured of high standards of primary eye care, refraction and optical aid dispensing.&nbsp; Second, practitioners will be required to maintain high standards in their professional practice through mandatory continuing professional education.&nbsp; Third, errant practitioners may be disciplined for, amongst other things, professional misconduct or negligence, or any improper act or conduct which brings disrepute to&nbsp;the profession, arising from a complaint brought by an aggrieved patient or client.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Our approach to regulation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The regulation of optometrists and opticians is, however, not straight-forward.&nbsp; In most other countries, there is a clear division of labour between optometrists and opticians, depending on their training.&nbsp; Optometrists are trained to perform refraction and basic eye examination procedures, such as examining eyeball pressure, visual field and retina.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1228<p> On the other hand, opticians are trained to prepare, adjust and fit optical aids and perform other retail duties.&nbsp; However, in Singapore, there is much overlap between the practices of these two groups of eye care professionals, with opticians doing refraction and optometrists dispensing optical aids.&nbsp; As a result, our public has become accustomed to having both refraction and dispensing provided by the same optical service provider rather than being served by separate providers, as is the case in many other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In developing our regulatory framework, our principal objective is to ensure that optometry and opticianry services are safe for our public.&nbsp; While we want to regulate the optometrists and opticians as two distinct professions, we want also&nbsp;to take into account market realities and to avoid unnecessary disruption to the way that the public uses the services of these professionals.&nbsp; Our legislation will therefore enable opticians to continue to perform refraction provided that they are properly trained.&nbsp; But we propose to exclude children under 8 from the persons whom an optician may refract.&nbsp; Young children are more difficult to refract and may have eye anomalies that opticians are not trained to detect.&nbsp; With our legislation, refraction services for such young children will require the higher skills of an optometrist.&nbsp; In addition, optometrists will be formally recognised for their ability to perform basic eye examination procedures and diagnose certain eye problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are mindful that regulation may cause some disruption to the practices of some existing optometrists and opticians, and we seek to minimise this as far as possible.&nbsp; Some opticians currently only perform dispensing and have no intention to learn refraction.&nbsp; We will register such opticians to perform only dispensing so as to allow them to continue their practice.&nbsp; Nonetheless, there is a competing need to ensure that opticians attain a reasonable level of competence.&nbsp; To achieve this <p align=left>Column: 1229<p>balance, existing opticians will be registered under the Act according to their experience, qualifications and competence.&nbsp; Those who do not satisfy certain minimum requirements will be required to undergo upgrading courses in order to qualify for registration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on this approach, we have drafted the Optometrists and Opticians&nbsp; Bill which is now before this House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Main features of Bill</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now go through the main features of this Bill.&nbsp; First, we have defined the acts constituting optometry and opticianry in the Schedule.&nbsp; Only persons who are registered as optometrists or opticians are allowed to perform the respective activities listed in the Schedule.&nbsp; However, exemptions will be made in subsidiary legislation to allow health professionals, such as medical practitioners and orthoptists, to continue performing eye examination procedures which are part of their scopes of practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part II of the Bill establishes the Optometrists and Opticians Board.&nbsp; The Board will be represented by members from the optometry, opticianry and ophthalmology professions, public officers from&nbsp;the Ministry of Health&nbsp;and the Ministry of Education&nbsp;as well as some lay-persons.&nbsp; The main functions of the Board are to approve or reject applications for registration, accredit courses in optometry and opticianry, and determine guidelines for the professional conduct and practice of optometrists and opticians.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part III sets out the role of the Registrar in maintaining the registers of optometrists and opticians, and the powers of the Board to take disciplinary action against registered optometrists or opticians, including the cancellation or suspension of the registration of such <p align=left>Column: 1230<p>persons, and the imposition of monetary penalties.&nbsp; It also provides for a right for any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board to appeal to the High Court.&nbsp; Part III also requires optometrists and opticians to apply for practising certificates, which will be made renewable, subject to mandatory continuing professional education to be specified in subsidiary legislation.&nbsp; This is to ensure that the practitioners continue to maintain a high level of competence so as to provide quality and safe primary eye care to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part IV provides for offences in regard to the unlawful engagement in optometry and opticianry and fraudulent registration.&nbsp; A person who practises optometry or opticianry without registration or a valid practising certificate will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $25,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding&nbsp;six months for a first offence, and a fine not exceeding $50,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months for subsequent offences.&nbsp; Under clause 29, the Board may also compound any offence prescribed as a compoundable offence under the Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part V, clause 31, allows for the appointment of Inspectors to investigate into offences under the Act, and complaints against registered optometrists and opticians.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, under Part VI, clause 39, the Contact Lens Practitioners Act will be repealed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Implementation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on implementation.&nbsp; To minimise the impact of regulation on contact lens practitioners licensed under the current Contact Lens Practitioners Act, licensed practitioners will be automatically registered as opticians and <p align=left>Column: 1231<p>granted practising certificates in respect of opticianry when the Act comes into operation.&nbsp; Furthermore, contact lens practitioners with the appropriate qualifications and experience may also apply to be registered as optometrists.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For optometrists, those with recognised qualifications and at least&nbsp;one year of optometry experience will be fully registered.&nbsp; Optometrists with less than&nbsp;one year of experience will be provisionally registered, and will have to work under supervision for&nbsp;one year before they become fully registered.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For opticians, those with work experience of at least&nbsp;five years will be fully registered as opticians if they pass a competency test.&nbsp; Those with between&nbsp;two&nbsp;and five years of experience will need to undergo a part-time modular upgrading course.&nbsp; There may be some opticians who do not intend to do any refraction but wish to do only dispensing; they will need to undergo a competency test or failing which, an upgrading programme but without the refraction component.&nbsp; In this way, we&nbsp;will ensure that they can uphold safe standards in dispensing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opticians with less than&nbsp;two years' experience and all new entrants to the profession will need to attend a certificate course in opticianry in order to qualify for registration. Singapore Polytechnic has organised a course to cater to these opticians.&nbsp;&nbsp;The course can be completed&nbsp;between nine and&nbsp;24 months, depending on the frequency of attending the modules.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further details of the registration of optometrists and opticians will be spelt out in subsidiary legislation to be enacted at a later date.&nbsp; My Ministry will be reaching out to existing optometrists and opticians through the media, seminars and other efforts&nbsp;to inform the practitioners on<p align=left>Column: 1232<p> the procedure for registration, including details on the competency tests and upgrading courses that are necessary for registration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In preparing this Bill, the Ministry has consulted persons who will be affected by this new legislation and,&nbsp;in particular, the key representative groups of the professions, such as the Singapore Optometric Association, the Singapore Opticianry Practitioners and the Singapore Polytechnic Optometry Centre.&nbsp; These stakeholders have been supportive of the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to consult them as we develop the subsidiary legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, we are ready now to regulate the practice of optometry and opticianry.&nbsp; The existing Contact Lens Practitioners&nbsp;Act has laid the ground for us to take this step, and years of training optometrists and opticians have created a sufficiently competitive market to support this move.&nbsp; I seek the House's support for this Bill to ensure that the public continues to enjoy high standards of eye care, in relation to the practice in optometry and opticianry in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.28 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill to regulate the practice of optometry and opticianry in Singapore is necessary and is long overdue.&nbsp; Singapore has one of the highest incidences of myopia in the world.&nbsp; A local study shows that by age seven, about 28% of children are myopic.&nbsp; And as the Minister of State has pointed out, 40% of Chinese adults above the age of 40 years suffer from myopia, which is a high prevalence rate for our adult population.&nbsp; Yet, the practice of optometry and opticianry has long<p align=left>Column: 1233<p> remained unregulated, leaving the public to make important decisions about their eyesight without any legal control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation is vastly different in many developed countries, such as the US, Canada, UK and Australia, which have long regulated the practice of optometry and opticianry in order to protect the public. But it is better late than never and I strongly welcome this Bill, which I hope will bring about the kind of improvement in standards that we have seen in the developed countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Bill, optometrists and opticians will now have to be registered, and they will also have to continuously upgrade their skills and capabilities to keep pace with new developments, thus ensuring that they maintain high standards of professionalism.&nbsp; In this way, the public can expect to have better standards of eye care, and optometrists and opticians will in turn be better recognised as healthcare professionals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, there is not enough recognition of optometry and opticianry as a profession, let alone as part of healthcare profession.&nbsp; Often, optometrists and opticians are regarded as merely retailers of eye care products.&nbsp; Hopefully, this Bill</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>will help to enhance the image of our optometrists and opticians and generate a better understanding of their role in helping Singaporeans to improve their eye health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The importance of this Bill and the need for standards to improve cannot be overemphasised.&nbsp; Years ago, when I needed a new pair of glasses, I picked up one from an optician.&nbsp; Unfortunately for me, the optician was poorly trained and ill-equipped to do a proper eye examination before prescribing the glasses.&nbsp; As a result, I had to endure a few months of terrible headaches which I did not realise was due to the poorly-fitted prescribed glasses until I went for a<p align=left>Column: 1234<p> proper eye check and was prescribed the correct glasses.&nbsp; I learned a painful lesson, but I am glad that there was no lasting damage.&nbsp; But we can never tell how many more people could have experienced the same problem and what is the extent of the damage to their health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to raise three issues with regard to this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, in many developed countries, as the Minister of State had correctly pointed out, a distinction is maintained between the role of optometrists and opticians.&nbsp; In a nutshell, these countries do not allow opticians to do refraction, that is, basic eye examination procedures such as examining eyeball pressure, visual field and retina.&nbsp; The Minister of State has also explained that the reason why there is no such distinction under the current Bill and opticians can continue to perform refraction, which they are currently doing, is because of the considerable overlap in the practice of optometry and opticianry in Singapore.&nbsp; And the Ministry does not want to disrupt the way the public uses the services of these professionals.&nbsp; I am not sure that this is a sufficient ground for continuing with the status quo.&nbsp; The primary consideration should&nbsp;be what is in the interest of the public and whether it is in their interest to continue to allow opticians to do refraction.&nbsp; A lot also depends on the kind of training that opticians undergo which we heard from the Minister of State will now be enhanced.&nbsp; But the question remains whether this is sufficient and extensive enough for them to do refraction, considering that some countries, like Australia&nbsp;and the US, even require a degree before someone can practise optometry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trained optometrist doing a comprehensive eye examination will not only be able to evaluate a person's vision for spectacles and contact lens, but the optometrist can also check the person's eye health through screening for eye <p align=left>Column: 1235<p>diseases such as glaucoma, cataracts, lid disorders, conjunctivitis and retinal disorders.&nbsp; As we have one of the highest rates of myopia in the world, which has just been confirmed by the Minister of State, a rapidly ageing population and an estimated one million people suffering from chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, hypertension, strokes and other chronic illnesses, obviously proper checks on eye health&nbsp;are important to prevent blindness and other debilitating eye disorders that will cost more to the Government and the individual to correct later on.&nbsp; For example, one optometrist shared with me about a 50-year-old man who wanted to get a pair of spectacles.&nbsp; The man claimed that he was in good health and not on any medication.&nbsp; However, when the optometrist did an internal eye examination, he noticed that there was bleeding in his retina.&nbsp; The optometrist referred him to an ophthalmologist who subsequently diagnosed diabetic retinopathy.&nbsp; The patient was an undiagnosed diabetic.&nbsp; His vision and life were saved because of a proper eye examination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am aware that opticians are already doing refraction and perhaps the Ministry's concern could be that we do not have enough optometrists today to separate the two functions.&nbsp; There may also be the concern about how this would impact on the livelihood of existing opticians.&nbsp; These are valid and practical concerns.&nbsp; One way to address these concerns is to allow existing opticians to continue to perform refraction and impose restrictions only on the new entrants to opticianry.&nbsp; This is also the suggestion, I believe, that has been made by the Singapore Optometrist Association which, I understand, has also voiced some concerns on this issue.&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry of Health could give us a better insight on why it decides to maintain the <I>status quo</I> and not take this opportunity, particularly considering the critical posi-<p align=left>Column: 1236<p>tion that we are in - myopia, ageing and the number of chronic illness are very high -&nbsp;to upgrade and impose higher standards by ensuring that gradually, over time, refraction is only done by trained and competent optometrists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point, Sir, is to ask&nbsp;how this Bill is going to be enforced once it becomes law.&nbsp; The Bill provides for the appointment of inspectors to ensure that the law is complied with and only registered optometrists and opticians can do eye examinations and prescribe glasses.&nbsp; Once registered, the Optometrists and Opticians Board could ensure that they go for continuing education before they will continue to be issued with the licence to practise, an important point to ensure that our optometrists and opticians continue to maintain high standards.&nbsp; And I want to&nbsp;really&nbsp;applaud the Ministry of Health as I think this is a very important and positive development.&nbsp; However, Sir, the real challenge lies in the implementation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that since 1996, we have had the Contact Lens Practitioners Act to regulate the contact lens practice, and to ensure that only properly trained practitioners are allowed to fit and dispense contact lens.&nbsp; Of course, this Act will now be subsumed under this Optometrists and Opticians Act.&nbsp; But, today, we can still find instances of contact lens being dispensed by untrained people in optical shops. I would, therefore, like to ask the Ministry of Health how it intends to enforce this Act, as there are now about 800 optical retail outlets in Singapore, a large number that would require a large enforcement machinery for this Bill to be properly enforced once it becomes law. A much wider issue, of course, is the sense of responsibility of businesses involved in this trade that they are not just selling a product, but a health accessory which, if badly fitted, can have a tremendous impact on the health of the user.&nbsp; But if this sense of responsibility is not yet <p align=left>Column: 1237<p>deeply ingrained, then we do need an effective enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance and to improve standards of eye care in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point is on the need to educate the public.&nbsp; There is generally a low level of awareness in Singapore about the importance of eye health and ensuring regular and proper eye checks.&nbsp; With more Singaporeans suffering from chronic diseases and with&nbsp;a rapidly ageing population, compounded by the onslaught of new technology such as the Internet and computer games, it is important for people, particularly those who are at risk, to have regular eye checks and to understand the importance of maintaining proper eye care.&nbsp; In this regard, I note that the Singapore Eye Research Institute, together with the NUS, has undertaken a study to examine the cause of the high myopia rates among infants and youngsters in Singapore. This is, indeed, an important move which, hopefully, could shed more light on why we have become a country with one of the highest number of myopics in the world and what other measures we can put in place to prevent a further deterioration of public health in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly hope that more researches of this nature could be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest, Sir, that we devote more resources and efforts to educate the public on the importance of regular eye checks and proper eye care, particularly among the young, in order to prevent myopia or to arrest the problem more effectively.&nbsp; There could be more concerted programmes in schools targeted at children and programmes in the HDB heartlands targeted at adults, particularly the elderly and those at risk.&nbsp; The elderly is, of course, a creeping problem now and I think the need for eye care health should also be addressed.&nbsp; A more pervasive programme on the proper use of computers at work would also be beneficial, particularly for workers who have to spend a lot of time doing <p align=left>Column: 1238<p>computer work.&nbsp; I do urge the Ministry to look into this and&nbsp;work with our schools, grassroots bodies, employers, workers and other relevant organisations to have a more effective public health outreach programme.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I think this is a very important and good Bill, and I fully support it.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.39 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Speaker, I rise in support of the Optometrists and Opticians Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vision is arguably one of the most important and valued of our human faculties.&nbsp; It is important for learning, working, moving about and enjoying human endeavours.&nbsp; In Singapore, many patients turn to optometrists and opticians whenever they experience visual problems.&nbsp; Optometrists and opticians can therefore play an important role as primary eyecare providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myopia is one of the most common eye conditions in Singapore and is also one of the most common causes of poor vision.&nbsp; Poor vision from myopia affects about 30% of our primary one students and about 65% of our primary six students.&nbsp; Interestingly, Singapore has the dubious honour of having one of the highest myopia incidences in the world.&nbsp; In fact, we are also known as the myopia capital of the world.&nbsp; The problem of myopia is also affecting Singaporeans at a much younger age.&nbsp; This \"myopia epidemic\" has caused much concern and attention nationally as sub-optimally managed myopia and severe myopia can result in amblyopia or lazy eyes and potentially blinding complications respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the decreasing total fertility rate and the rapidly ageing population in Singapore, one in five Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above by the year 2030.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1239<p> The prevalence of chronic systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension and eye conditions such as glaucoma, aged-related macular degeneration and cataracts, will see a significant rise with the increasing ageing population.&nbsp; It is envisaged that the role of primary eye care providers is even more important as early detection and management of these eye conditions will result in better visual prognosis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike most developed countries, Singapore currently does not regulate its optometrists and opticians, other than those involved in the practice of contact lens fitting and dispensing.&nbsp; In most developed countries, like Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, United Kingdom and the United States, the practice of optometry and opticianry is tightly regulated.&nbsp; In these countries, only those with the appropriate qualifications can register and practise as optometrists and opticians.&nbsp; In general, optometrists function as primary eyecare providers, performing refraction, eye screening and basic eyecare while opticians dispense optical aids.&nbsp; Errant practitioners can be disciplined by the respective regulatory agencies.&nbsp; However, this is not so in Singapore currently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, practitioners learn their role through apprenticeships and only a small number was trained overseas.&nbsp; The situation has started to change in the 1990s when Singapore Polytechnic started conducting courses in optometry. It is prudent to maintain high standards in the optometry and opticianry profession as many people turn to them whenever they have visual problems, commonly blurring of vision.&nbsp; Improper optometry and opticianry practices can pose a health risk to the public.&nbsp; Hence, although the intent and purpose of this Bill has been mooted for sometime now, it is timely and necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1240<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Up until now, the optometry and opticianry industry is a low entry barrier industry.&nbsp; It requires little or no formal training for one to set up a practice in the private sector.&nbsp; Few or almost nobody demand to see the qualification of the optometrists and opticians that they visit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill provides for the setting of a proper footing for the primary eyecare industry.&nbsp; It will definitely raise the standard of primary eyecare providers through the requirement of formal training for the optometrists and opticians.&nbsp; This is an important step in the right direction. The registration of optometrists and opticians would bring the industry practice in line with other healthcare professionals.&nbsp; Mandating continued professional education as a prerequisite for subsequent renewal of the practising certificates is important as such a requirement will ensure that these primary eyecare providers keep up to date with new developments in their fields and also to maintain a high level of competency so as to provide quality and safe primary eyecare to the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I strongly support Part II of the Bill which calls for the establishment of the Optometrists and Opticians Board.&nbsp; With the setting up of the Optometrists and Opticians Board, under the new statutory regulatory framework, professional guidelines, including the training requirements for admission to the register, accreditation of courses and disciplinary actions against errant practitioners will be set.&nbsp; This would go towards raising the optometrists and opticians' professional standards and also instill a higher level of patients' confidence.&nbsp; In addition, in order to protect the interest of Singaporeans, I would like to suggest the imposition of provisional registration for foreigners or locals with overseas training should they want to practise in Singapore.&nbsp; This would allow the Board to assess the competency level of these practitioners before they receive<p align=left>Column: 1241<p> their full registration.&nbsp; This practice is similar to those of other professional healthcare providers, like doctors and dentists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Schedule sets out the acts or activities contributing to the practices of opticianry and optometry.&nbsp; However, there is ambiguity in Part II of the Schedule on whether</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Such pharmaceutical eyedrops can give rise to local as well as systemic side effects or adverse reactions, and therefore must only be used with proper medical supervision and guidance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the Bill has many positive elements and is worth supporting, it is indeed like a duck floating in a pond.&nbsp; While we see the duck floating gracefully, we need to also be conscious of the duck's struggle below the water.&nbsp; The introduction of the Bill to regulate the industry would also cause disruption to the existing primary eyecare practitioners.&nbsp; The Ministry should strive to be as fair and as reasonable as possible in managing the current group of primary&nbsp;eyecare practitioners.&nbsp; It is estimated that, amongst these existing practitioners, about 40% are without any formal training.&nbsp; Requiring them to go for formal training, passing the test and then be registered with the new Board&nbsp;seems to be the right and logical thing to do.&nbsp; However, there are quite a sizeable number of them with decent on-the-job training and many years of experience, but may lack the linguistic capability to pass the necessary qualifying examinations for registration.&nbsp; They may therefore unwittingly be forced out of the industry altogether and lose their only livelihood.&nbsp; This would be unfair and very unfortunate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1242<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, one of the perennial concerns of regulating any industry is the added cost as a result of compliance.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to closely monitor the situation with the implementation of this Bill and to reassure the public that the Bill would not lead to spiralling of costs in the primary eyecare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on that note, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp;

With our open and global market economy, the industry will see more partnerships, joint ventures, international patrons and also cross border collaboration and interaction.&nbsp; One very recent example of this would be NeuroVision, a Singapore-based eyecare specialist partnership with Essilor International, a world leader in optical products.&nbsp;With more such opportunities, we have to be prepared and adapt as well as evolve.&nbsp; Our standards have to be on par with the rest of the&nbsp;First World.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 11th&nbsp;October 1953, a group of dispensing opticians met in Kentucky, USA, and the elected&nbsp;office bearers formed the society of dispensing opticians with a membership&nbsp;fee of only US$10 each.&nbsp;They formed it because, and&nbsp;I<p align=left>Column: 1243<p> quote, \"to promote increased efficiency and higher qualifications of dispensing opticians by state law providing licences only to properly qualified persons.\"&nbsp; That was in 1953.&nbsp; We are now in 2007.&nbsp; It is more than half a century, and it is indeed time for regulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economic theory suggests that in the absence of regulation, certain health personnel may provide lower quality service at higher quality prices to uninformed consumers.&nbsp; Thus, regulation will help to improve services and protect consumers and Singaporeans are indeed high consumers of eye services and products.&nbsp; What with four out of five young adults being myopic before the age of 21 years, where one-fifth of our young myopics have a high degree of myopia being of greater than 600 degrees and where the current trend shows a higher rate of myopia starting at the pre-school levels.&nbsp; Regulation will certainly set the minimum standards of education, qualification and experience.&nbsp; It would also help to specify permissible boundaries of practice as there is frequent overlap in the job description of the optometrists and the opticians.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulation will help enhance professionalism as well. Professional ethics must be adhered to strictly. And with this, there must be a formalised programme of continuing professional development to help continuous enhancement of technical and practical proficiencies.&nbsp; This would require an appointed Secretariat working with the proposed Board to set minimum standards and required hours of attendances.&nbsp; For those in the profession, who are specialised or sub-specialised, there may have to be a separate requirement for that as well.&nbsp; And I note the details given by the MOS on this in his earlier speech.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example for us to consider would be, in Hong Kong, the register of <p align=left>Column: 1244<p>optometrists is divided into two different&nbsp;parts.&nbsp; Part I is where the optometrist who is registered under this Part can practise without any restriction.&nbsp; And for Part II, certain stipulated restrictions are there but Part&nbsp;II registered optometrist can be registered as Part I, if he fulfils certain training and experiential requirements.&nbsp; Documentation and checking system, preferably electronic, would also be required for ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a study in 1986 in the district of Columbia and it found that increasing the restrictiveness of optometrist's licensing examination had a positive and statistically significant impact on the price of eye examination and eye glasses but need not have a significant impact on the quality of eye examination measured by the thoroughness of the examination.&nbsp; We hope that the prices will certainly not be too much affected by the regulation that we are setting upon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The setting up of the Optometrists and Opticians Board is essential and indeed very timely.&nbsp; However, I would suggest dialogues and sessions to meet up and reach out to those affected, to gather&nbsp;feedback and hear their inputs before formalisation.&nbsp; Perhaps, a team can be set up to randomly visit some of these existing optical and eyecare shops to assist with relevant explanation,&nbsp;get feedback and checks through engagement of these personnel.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

That is a very low number indeed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note with delight that there will at least be one person on the proposed Board who will not be a doctor,&nbsp;optician or&nbsp;optometrist, and this will usually be from the consumer.&nbsp; This is a positive step for the consumer to give feedback and also sit on the Board.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1245<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also glad to hear that there will be allowance for the Board to set up an appropriate committee, when necessary, for special duties and projects.&nbsp; This is relevant, as those with valuable skills and inputs must be invited to come forward and contribute.&nbsp; Examples would be physicians, legal representatives and also consumers when necessary.&nbsp; The Board may also want to consider mandating display of certification.&nbsp; This is because with the current status, there are eyecare product shops a dime a dozen in most malls and also in heartland areas.&nbsp; Thus, for the public to know that the premises are registered and&nbsp;recognised, there must be some form of identification which the public can identify.&nbsp; As we know, there are many so-called opticians and optical shops that are available widely in Singapore, and some of them are actually very old shops that have been passed down from generation to generation where many of the people who run these shops are performing refraction and also optical procedures are not highly qualified and do not have formal education.&nbsp; So we may have to give them a bit of time to adjust to this new regulation as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board will also have to decide on the duration of validity for the certification of practice.&nbsp; Usually, for most other professions, this is stipulated at about two to three years, and there is a reason for that.&nbsp; This is because, beyond that, usually you would need to be upgraded and updated in terms of information.&nbsp; So, that is something for us to consider as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the line between an optometrist and ophthalmologist with respect to detecting and treating eye diseases is also blurring.&nbsp; In places without therapeutic pharmaceutical agent law for optometrist, such as in Singapore, they must still refer patients to ophthalmologists for treatment where eye diseases are being detected or are present.&nbsp; With respect to contact lens<p align=left>Column: 1246<p> dispensing, too, there is a need to define the job scope further for clarity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more area for the Board to consider will be that of the recruitment of foreign-trained optometrists and opticians.&nbsp; As we see more foreigners in our midst, we must have an allowance for their recruitment as well.&nbsp; What will be the policy in terms of recognition of foreign certification or their entry criteria for a job in Singapore?&nbsp; Let me share with you an example from country X, where the professional and ethical standards for practice states:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Foreign reciprocity:&nbsp; No foreigner shall be admitted to the Optometric Board Examinations unless he proves in a manner prescribed by the rules of court the country of which he is a citizen, subject or national either admits our citizens to the practice of optometry without restriction or allows them to practise after an examination on terms of absolute or strict equality with citizens, subjects and nationals of the said country.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We may not be taking a course along these lines but it is certainly&nbsp;something for us to consider.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of complaints, I hope there can be some design to facilitate the resolution of complaints at the lowest and most appropriate level possible and also to avoid duplication of complaint resolution processes.&nbsp; There must, however, be some flexibility in handling the complaints system.&nbsp; Options may include taking no action at all, a decision that an action is unnecessary or inappropriate, referral to an advocate or a provider for resolution, or calling a mediation conference without a need for formal investigations.&nbsp; Investigations will be reserved for more serious cases, certainly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, of course, the stiffer penalties that are stipulated in these current guidelines are something which hopefully will serve as a deterrent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1247<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;first, I would like to declare my interest as an eyecare professional, an ophthalmologist.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has one of the highest myopia rates in the world and an ageing population, which has been alluded to by my parliamentary colleagues earlier.&nbsp; This has resulted in an ever-increasing demand for quality vision correction, especially&nbsp;for myopia and&nbsp;presbyopia.&nbsp; The optometrists, opticians and ophthalmologists are the main eyecare providers to cater for vision correction and eye health provision for the entire population and&nbsp;the foreigners who are staying here. &nbsp;The optometrists and opticians form the&nbsp;primary eyecare layer, while the&nbsp;ophthalmologists provide the secondary and tertiary eyecare which is mainly interventional, be it medical or surgical.&nbsp; In this respect, the three eyecare providers work together to form a seamless eyecare continuum to provide the best eyecare possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of the Optometrists and Opticians Bill will provide the legal framework to recognise our&nbsp;optician and optometrist colleagues&nbsp;as professionals, an equal partner in doing their job.&nbsp; In doing so, the public will benefit with the assurance of a standard of professional care by the opticians and optometrists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have three&nbsp;concerns regarding this particular Bill, two of which have been mentioned by earlier speakers as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Will the older members of the trade be given ample time and opportunities to get the necessary certification?&nbsp; As the Ministry has dealt with the traditional Chinese medicine registration, I am <p align=left>Column: 1248<p>confident that&nbsp;that experience will be well used in this case as well.&nbsp; Some of the older&nbsp;opticians learned their trade through apprenticeship over many years.&nbsp; Although they are experienced, they&nbsp;lack the necessary qualifications.&nbsp; I hope the new Board formed will take this into consideration and provide them with ample time, opportunities and training to allow them to register so they can continue their practice but without compromise on the standard of care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Will the registration and recertification process result in an increase in the cost of eyecare to consumers?&nbsp; I think the likely answer is, yes.&nbsp; With this Bill, the optometrists and opticians will be licensed and they&nbsp;will need regular recertification to ensure currency of their knowledge and skills.&nbsp; While all these will ensure quality eyecare, they also mean an increase in cost.&nbsp; I hope the new Board will keep registration, training and recertification costs to a minimum, so that the increase in eyecare cost for consumers will be minimised.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) This is my chief concern - will this Bill result in an unhealthy competition and a division in&nbsp;the eyecare sector similar to what is seen in some states in the USA?&nbsp; I would like to highlight the dangers that this Bill may be&nbsp;divisive to the eyecare industry.&nbsp; I was in America about two years ago for&nbsp;the American Association of Ophthalmologists' (AAO) meeting.&nbsp; This is a very big annual meeting attended by about 20,000 ophthalmologists and, at that particular meeting, there is a standard clause there.&nbsp; They&nbsp;deny the attendance of all their instruction courses as well as lectures&nbsp;by any optician and optometrist.&nbsp; This is because some of the opticians and optometrists have overstepped their clinical&nbsp;competence and performed ophthalmic intervention procedures, including surgical procedures, on their clients.&nbsp; The optometrists have lobbied through their individual state legislature to allow them<p align=left>Column: 1249<p> to perform ophthalmic surgery, such as Lasik, using the training certificate issued by AAO as proof of proper training.&nbsp; Such practice, as we know, is unethical and is detrimental to the standard of eyecare for the public.&nbsp; I hope the new Optometrists and Opticians Board will ensure and maintain the highest standard of optometry and opticianry care for the public.&nbsp; There is definitely a need for close continuous&nbsp;consultation between the new Board and the Chapter of Ophthalmologists in the Singapore Academy of Medicine to ensure close collaboration between all eyecare providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that&nbsp;at least, on the Board, one of them is an ophthalmologist.&nbsp; In order&nbsp;to ensure that there is close collaboration and consultation, may I suggest that this particular ophthalmologist appointed to the new Optometrists and Opticians Board could perhaps be a board member of the Chapter of Ophthalmologists in the Singapore Academy of Medicine.&nbsp; With that arrangement, I hope the new Optometrists and Opticians Board will work very closely with the&nbsp;Chapter of Ophthalmologists&nbsp;to provide the best eyecare to the public.&nbsp; I hope that&nbsp;in this way&nbsp;they will really work together and see eye-to-eye and not work against one another, an eye-for-an-eye.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of providing eyecare, I do agree to some point with Mdm Halimah Yacob in the sense that opticians should be provided some leeway, but I do not agree that they should not be allowed to do refraction.&nbsp; I think it is a matter of training.&nbsp; With proper training, I think the optician should be allowed to do refraction.&nbsp; The key thing is for the new Board to decide and to make sure that their training is adequate to ensure that the opticians are able to meet the mark of standards to provide the best eyecare possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second portion that I wanted to bring up is what Dr Lam brought up<p align=left>Column: 1250<p> regarding the use of eyedrops.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is a great concern.&nbsp; To some of our ophthalmologist colleagues, they may see the use of eyedrops becoming&nbsp;an intervention.&nbsp; However, in performing their duties in eye examination, sometimes these eyedrops may be necessary.&nbsp; There are certainly dangers to&nbsp;the use of these eyedrops because there are side effects.&nbsp; I think, with proper training and certification, the optometrists may be allowed to use, but that I would leave it to the Board to decide, as well as in close consultation with the Chapter of Ophthalmologists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this Bill,&nbsp;optometry and opticianry in Singapore will no longer be just an optical trade, but a profession - a profession that has a role in looking after the vision health of the entire population and beyond.&nbsp; I sincerely look forward to an exciting new era in eyecare in Singapore with optimism and enthusiasm.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.26 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak on the Optometrists and Opticians Bill.&nbsp; Please allow me to start with these facts as a layman.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myopia is the most common eye problem among children in Singapore.&nbsp; One in four seven-year-olds in Singapore is myopic, compared to about one in a hundred in Australia.&nbsp; Every other 12-year-old Singaporean suffers from myopia.&nbsp; Over 80% of our 18-year-olds are shortsighted.&nbsp; These figures rank the country as having one of the highest rates of myopia in the world.&nbsp; If poorly treated, this medical condition can lead to irrecoverable loss in vision or, worse still, sometimes blindness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such an alarming rate of myopia in the country, it is worrying to know that<p align=left>Column: 1251<p> apart from the Contact Lens Practitioners Act of 1985, the eyecare industry is currently self-regulated.&nbsp; While we have first-class research and education expertise at the Singapore National Centre, a comprehensive cost-effective primary care structure is lacking.&nbsp; For instance, optometry, as a profession, is not really recognised.&nbsp; Practically, anyone can set up an optical shop, do a so-called eye test and issue prescription spectacles.&nbsp; In these cases, without the proper qualification and training, myopia and common eye diseases in children and adults will go undetected, poorly treated and, eventually, could lead to irrecoverable loss in vision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, we must realise that people who visit the optical shops are not merely \"customers\" seeking cool shades.&nbsp; They are actually patients seeking a diagnosis and treatment of visual deficiencies and eye health from someone whom they perceive as an \"eyecare professional\".&nbsp; Unfortunately, under the current circumstances, this might not necessarily be the case.&nbsp; Sometimes, our vision is blurred by the appearances, especially when we enter a shop and are greeted by people in a crisp white coat and a shiny nametag.&nbsp; While there are opticians or optometrists who are truly qualified out there, there are also some who are merely \"optical illusionists\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to enhance our capacity for competent and cost-effective eyecare, the Ministry of Health has rightly introduced a statutory regulatory framework to regulate the practice of optometry and opticianry in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In essence, the general public has a lot to benefit from the proposed changes.&nbsp; I am confident, Madam, that the new regulation will raise the overall standard of eyecare by ensuring a certain level of competence, standards of practice and<p align=left>Column: 1252<p> accountability by a certified eyecare professional.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a patient goes to see an optician or optometrist, he can be assured that the person he meets is a properly qualified, trained and recognised optometrist or optician.&nbsp; The patient will also know that the skills and knowledge of these practitioners are continually kept up-to-date with the latest developments in their field through a systematic professional education programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The effectiveness of regulating the eyecare industry can be seen in many developed countries, such as the US, UK and Australia, who already have similar legislation in place. In most cases, statutory regulation has proven to improve the quality of eyecare for the patients and also develop experts and professionals in the practice of optometry.&nbsp; This also leads to an expanded scope of practice and career development.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, qualified optometrists and opticians have an important role to play in patient education.&nbsp; Optometrists who are academically qualified are commonly regarded as the general practitioners of eyecare. For example, in the United States, Canada and the Philippines, very often, the practising optometrists are highly qualified and he carries the title of \"Dr of Optometry\" as he provides professional primary eyecare.&nbsp; And, at times, the combined assessment by an eyecare professional together with the relevant medical specialists can lead to early detection of systemic manifestations such as anemia, diabetes, hypertension, neurological problems such as tumours and minor strokes, not to mention many primary eye conditions.&nbsp; For maximum effectiveness, the Government needs to embark on a continuous public education programme to help patients better understand the field of optometry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans need to see the differences<p align=left>Column: 1253<p> between opticians and optometrists and the capabilities of each professional.&nbsp; Only then can members of the public help to weed out the errant practitioners.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before seeking treatment, patients should approach their practitioners eyeball-to-eyeball and demand that they provide their qualifications and relevant certifications.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mentioned earlier that myopia is the most common eye problem amongst children in Singapore.&nbsp; I believe that we are all very concerned with this trend.&nbsp; I am also encouraged to see that in the 2007 Budget, $86 million has been set aside for health education and promotion initiatives including the National Myopia Prevention Programme.&nbsp; I have been following the National Myopia Prevention Programme organised by the Health Promotion Board since it started in 2001 and would like to enquire on the public response and effectiveness of the programme.&nbsp;Are we doing enough to raise awareness on myopia amongst the students and parents?&nbsp; Can we include in&nbsp;the proposed legislation a programme with all the eyecare professionals to support the national programme, especially in&nbsp;patient education?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the problem of myopia in our younger population, we also face the problem of blindness in the young. Could we also enlist the support from these eyecare professionals to screen for conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration and refractive errors which can affect the vision of the elderly?&nbsp;&nbsp;While patients with refractive errors can be treated by the optometrists, those found to have age-related macular degeneration, which is a leading cause of blindness in developed world, or glaucoma or cataracts, should be referred to the&nbsp;ophthalmologists for proper treatment.&nbsp; If left untreated, the patients may be unaware of its seriousness and treatment may no longer be effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1254<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, the introduction of this Bill is both timely and necessary.&nbsp; I strongly believe that the proposed framework will benefit both patients and the profession.&nbsp; Patients can be assured of access to eyecare that is affordable and of high standards whilst practitioners will be accorded their deserved professional development, recognition and protection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.33 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Heng Chee How:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, first, I thank the Members who have spoken - Mdm Halimah, Dr Fatimah Lateef, Dr Lam Pin Min, Dr Lim Wee Kiak as well as Mr Zainudin Nordin for their very constructive views and for their strong support for this Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very happy that we all agree and see very clearly the key intentions of this Bill which&nbsp;are that eyecare is a very important part of well-being and, as a country, we must do our utmost to safeguard and promote it and that optometrists and opticians play an integral and important role in this entire care spectrum.&nbsp; So the regulation of these two professions, properly done, will enhance the national objectives. What are these objectives?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be that we want our population to have access to quality, high standard and safe eyecare at prices that are affordable,&nbsp;and&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;in a way that takes into account the market realities, without compromising safety and standards, to move forward with minimum disruptions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have grouped some of the comments by the Members into several parts and I will take them in turn now.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah was of the opinion that&nbsp;we adopt the situation in many other countries where<p align=left>Column: 1255<p> you draw a clear line in the area of refraction -&nbsp;let the optometrists do the refraction and do not let the opticians do it, because it is something that is specialised.&nbsp; Some of the other Members have mentioned that we ought to take into account the fact that there are already opticians in Singapore who have been doing refraction adequately, and for years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak has also pointed out to us that&nbsp;it is not a question of who gets to do it but whether or not the person who is doing it is competent to do it.&nbsp; And on this point, I agree with him, namely,&nbsp;it is a question of safety and&nbsp;standards. So, therefore, in this process of regulating, what we are going for is not to say that whoever is an optician and&nbsp;decides to do refraction,&nbsp;that he can just carry on and do it, but that there will be a competency test.&nbsp; And those who want to do refraction as opticians will have to pass this test.&nbsp; And if they pass, they will be certified&nbsp;that they meet the standards and then they can do so safely for their customers.&nbsp; And if they do not pass, then they go through an upgrading programme in order to make sure that they are competent before they are certified to practise. Then, for opticians who do not want to practise refraction - they just want to do dispensing -&nbsp;they will be certified to do dispensing.&nbsp; In that way, we separate between the groups of opticians and make sure that only those who are competent and certified to do refraction do&nbsp;refraction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also asked&nbsp;how&nbsp;we intend to go about enforcing this&nbsp;Bill once it is passed.&nbsp; I think, as in all legislation, enforcement is key in order for it to be credible. Yes, there are many hundreds of optical shops out there and it will not be possible to station a checker or an inspector in every shop all the time to ensure that nothing goes wrong.&nbsp; But the<p align=left>Column: 1256<p> same could be said of any other kind of business.&nbsp; In the end, it would be&nbsp;through a combination of opening up the channels for feedback, collecting information and intelligence of where sub-standard service,&nbsp;incompetent service or unlawful servicing might be going on as well as through regular and surprise inspections, and taking to task those who have been found to be in breach of the regulations.&nbsp; Through this combination of efforts, I think we can send a very strong signal to the industry that, on the one hand, we provide upgrading paths as we want to ensure standards and, on the other hand, that those who do not comply with the regulations would have to face the music. By doing so, we would make sure that nobody in this industry goes off with the wrong impression that&nbsp;they can continue in any way to remain unprofessional and get by with it and, in a way, cheat the customer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must also say that industry associations can play a very important role here. These associations have members who are opticians or optometrists and it is in their professional interest that they encourage their members to comply fully with those regulations as well as to take full advantage of all upgrading opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah raised the point&nbsp;that even as&nbsp;we enforce and&nbsp;there may be complaints, the flipside of it is how&nbsp;we resolve these complaints without making the process&nbsp;too cumbersome. If they are the simple ones, can they not be resolved as simply as possible at the lowest possible level?&nbsp; I think that is a good suggestion.&nbsp;We have to see it in the context of the entire mechanism of dealing with these complaints and investigations, to grade the different types of complaints.&nbsp;Those that are suitable for resolution at the lowest level,&nbsp;the simplest possible level, should be&nbsp;so resolved.&nbsp; But, at the same time, I think&nbsp;it should also be very clear to people that&nbsp;if there is<p align=left>Column: 1257<p> wrongdoing,&nbsp;it will be fully investigated and there are regulations to provide for that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of public education, including educating the public to go for regular eye screening and so on,&nbsp;we&nbsp;completely agree, and&nbsp;this is something that we have to step up and maintain our efforts simply because good vision is very important to our population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the point of whether regulation would drive up business cost, we will put it this way.&nbsp; Obviously, if you do not have to comply with anything compared to if you have to comply with something,&nbsp;a certain amount of attention has now to be paid.&nbsp; As far as the Optometrists and Opticians Board (OOB) is concerned, I am very sure that it will not be in its interest nor will it be its intention to drive this cost up unnecessarily.&nbsp; I would say that it will regulate only as necessary and not make that an issue that would hamper the practitioners and, ultimately, have the cost&nbsp;passed on to&nbsp;customers and undermine one of the fundamental objectives, which is affordability.&nbsp; So it is a question of balancing.&nbsp; But the intention must be to keep it to the minimum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of those practitioners, especially the opticians who have been doing so for many years but who may lack the language abilities or the formal education, under the implementation process, the idea is that for those with more than five years' experience, they will be put through a competency test.&nbsp;It is a practical test, so&nbsp;they are not placed at a disadvantage&nbsp; if, for example,&nbsp;they cannot speak English.&nbsp; And if&nbsp;they have experience and&nbsp;they know how to do it,&nbsp;that test will reveal&nbsp;their competency and&nbsp;they will be certified for it.&nbsp; Even for those who do not pass it the first time, there will be another attempt and&nbsp;there will be a course for those who have to go through&nbsp;upgrading.&nbsp; So I want to assure the House that every effort will be made to enable people with the competence to be so<p align=left>Column: 1258<p> certified but they must demonstrate that competence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of the respective roles and the synergies that can come out of the three groups - the ophthalmologists,&nbsp;optometrists and&nbsp;opticians,&nbsp;which Dr Lim Wee Kiak brought up - if we do it properly, we can indeed derive those synergies that he talked about and that must indeed be our aim.&nbsp; I am very sure that the OOB, in&nbsp;its establishment, will make that a priority.&nbsp; It will be aided by the fact that its composition would have representatives from all three groups and more.&nbsp; And Dr Lim Wee Kiak's suggestion that a&nbsp;particular nominee comes from the Chapter of Ophthalmologists is something that the OOB can take into account.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were inputs from Dr Fatimah&nbsp;as well as Dr Lam Pin Min on what&nbsp;we can do with regard to the conditional registration of foreign practitioners. Again, I thank them for their inputs and we will take this into consideration in&nbsp;drawing up the regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the specialist eyedrops, which is that line between the optometrist and the ophthalmologist, I think the general response will be the same as that for&nbsp;refraction, which is between the opticians and optometrists which is that, ultimately, it is the science of it, the competence of it, that safety is of primary concern, and we will make sure that in regulating this, we will not subject our population to risks that they ought not&nbsp;be exposed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a suggestion on the display of certificates so that&nbsp;a member of public, who does not know who is whom,&nbsp;can actually look at the certificate and feel confident that if&nbsp;he comes into the shop, he will get good standards and safe eyecare. This is a very good idea.&nbsp; I believe this will be taken up.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This programme was started in 2001 and it was done in partnership with the Ministry of Education and MCYS.&nbsp; The aim of the programme was to delay the onset and reduce the progression of myopia in children.&nbsp; The prevention strategies include public education targeted at parents, teachers and children to inculcate good eyecare habits, such as adopting correct posture when reading, ensuring adequate lighting and having regular outdoor activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HPB also introduced a vision screening programme in primary and secondary schools, and a Spectacles Fund to help children from needy families buy spectacles.&nbsp;&nbsp; On this, HPB works closely with kindergartens/childcare centres to extend the vision screening to pre-schoolers.&nbsp; The aim is to identify children with early myopia and the lazy eye problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; About one in seven pre-schoolers have defective vision and they are referred to refraction clinics in the polyclinics for further assessment and management.&nbsp; For children with the lazy eye condition, early treatment can prevent the development of functional blindness.&nbsp; These are serious ongoing efforts, but we also recognise that bringing down the myopia rate is an uphill task.&nbsp; We will continue to put in our efforts in this area to slow down the progression, even if we may not able to reverse the rate in the short term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin has also suggested that the HPB work more closely with the different eyecare professionals to enlist their help in this programme.&nbsp;

The first clarification I would like to ask the Minister of State is whether he agrees<p align=left>Column: 1260<p> that by having two Registers&nbsp;-&nbsp;one for optometrists and the other for opticians - there is already a recognition that there are different levels of competencies residing in these two categories of professionals, and that even with the enhanced training, this dichotomy remains.&nbsp; If this is the case, should we not then, as we are trying to internationalise our medical hub and as we are trying to aspire for higher standards, also try to align our practice with&nbsp;international practice or the practice that exists in the developed countries?&nbsp; We may not aspire today but we can certainly aspire for the future, in the sense that existing opticians&nbsp; - I know there are over 1,500 of them -&nbsp;certainly, we do not want to break their rice bowls and affect their livelihood.&nbsp; But should we not consider&nbsp;better standards for the future?&nbsp; Because we are already recognising this by having two Registers with different competency levels.&nbsp; Should we not move higher in line with the developed countries?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second clarification is: in MOH's view,&nbsp;how do we help the public so that they will not be confused when we now have opticians who can do refraction and opticians who cannot do refraction?&nbsp; They already have a big difficulty trying to assess whether those who are dispensing spectacles and contact lenses are competent or not, but now in addition to that, there are sub-set opticians and optometrists and there are opticians who can do refraction and those who cannot.&nbsp; Could the Minister of State clarify and enlighten how we do not further confuse the public?&nbsp; What are the blind sights of this particular strategy that you are having?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Heng Chee How:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, on the first question of having two Registers&nbsp;-&nbsp;one for optometrists and the other for opticians - that is correct, because we are not saying&nbsp;that they are the same.&nbsp; They are not the same.&nbsp; Yes, optometrists can definitely do refraction, <p align=left>Column: 1261<p>but&nbsp;optometrists are not just opticians who can do refraction.&nbsp; They can do other things as well.&nbsp; So it is a spectrum.&nbsp; What we are saying here is that&nbsp;some opticians in Singapore over all these years are already doing refraction, and there are opticians who are just doing dispensing.&nbsp; Opticians who are doing refraction, subject to being tested and certified to&nbsp;demonstrate their competence,&nbsp;can carry on to do refraction.&nbsp; This does not make them optometrists.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For opticians who can do refraction and want to become optometrists, they must then take on other skills&nbsp;in order to qualify for registration as optometrists.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have&nbsp;two Registers.&nbsp; Even if an optician&nbsp;can do refraction, he&nbsp;is not an optometrist.&nbsp; That is number one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her second question is whether we will further confuse the public when&nbsp; the Act comes into force, in the case of a person who&nbsp;walks into a shop and&nbsp;sees some opticians who can do refraction and some who cannot.&nbsp; The reality today is, with&nbsp;or without this Act,&nbsp;there are opticians in Singapore who are doing refraction and there are opticians&nbsp;who are&nbsp;not doing refraction.&nbsp; This is the current situation.&nbsp; What we are doing here is&nbsp;through a process of certification, and what Dr Fatimah Lateef has suggested, namely, the display of&nbsp;certificates, and through&nbsp;public education, ie, what types of eyecare professionals are there and what&nbsp;they do respectively.&nbsp; So it will take time, as the public gains more awareness of the different types of eyecare professionals and who they should see and for what.&nbsp; This is a process that will go on and, through time, people will&nbsp;be more aware of&nbsp;it.&nbsp; But the point is that when the Act comes into force, nobody walking into a&nbsp;shop of an optical&nbsp;service provider&nbsp;will be subjected to unsafe eyecare.&nbsp; That is the point.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

My point is that we are trying to make ourselves into an international/regional medical hub.&nbsp; And, obviously,&nbsp;we therefore want to align&nbsp;ourselves with international standards, especially that of developed countries.&nbsp; In developed countries, refractions are done by optometrists, and not opticians, which means that they have moved to higher standards.&nbsp; Should we not also be thinking about that, not immediately?&nbsp; I recognise that there is a dearth or insufficient&nbsp;opticians to provide for the needs of the population at the present moment.&nbsp; There are over 1,500&nbsp;opticians and it is not&nbsp;right to break their livelihood.&nbsp;

In the history of our nation-building, a few pioneering individuals and&nbsp;corporations have been strong and consistent supporters of education.&nbsp; Ngee Ann Kongsi is one such pioneer that has made significant contributions to our education system.&nbsp; The Kongsi established the Ngee Ann College in 1963.&nbsp; Some four decades later, with the funding and support of both the Government and Ngee Ann Kongsi, the college has grown to become&nbsp;the Ngee Ann Polytechnic, an institution of&nbsp;higher education that is well respected by employers and reputed internationally.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1264<p> Ngee Ann Kongsi has not only contributed money to help fund student programmes, but also provided much of the land for the polytechnic's campus.&nbsp; Generations of students have benefited from the Kongsi&rsquo;s unwavering support for education.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ngee Ann Kongsi was incorporated by the Ngee Ann Kongsi (Incorporation) Ordinance of 1933 to administer its income and properties for various worthy causes, including the support for education.&nbsp; The Ordinance originally required the Kongsi to donate 50% of its income or $100,000 annually, whichever is higher, to Ngee Ann College in perpetuity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in 1972, Ngee Ann Kongsi proposed to develop its property along Orchard Road.&nbsp; The Government felt that the gains from the appreciation of property value were a result of the overall development of the Orchard Road area and therefore a larger portion of such gains should benefit the society at large.&nbsp; The Ordinance was then amended to increase the Kongsi's contribution to Ngee Ann Polytechnic to 75% of its income, in return for land development rights for its property along Orchard Road.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><I>Need for amendment</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been significant changes over the years.&nbsp; For example, Ngee Ann Kongsi's annual income has grown substantially from $0.5 million in 1972 to $23 million in 2006 mainly due to dividend income earned through its interests in the Ngee Ann City development.&nbsp; Ngee Ann Kongsi's contribution over the years has allowed Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Endowment Fund to be accumulated to $119.3 million as at end of FY2006.&nbsp; It is therefore both appropriate and timely to amend the Ordinance with a view to giving the Kongsi more flexibility in its contributions so that a wider spectrum of society can benefit from them.</p><p align=left>Column: 1265<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now highlight the key clauses of the Ngee Ann Kongsi (Incorporation) (Amendment) Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key clauses of Bill</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><I>Scope of contribution of income by Ngee Ann Kongsi</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, we want to preserve the original intent of&nbsp;Parliament when it last amended the Ordinance in 1972 that 75% of Ngee Ann Kongsi's income should benefit the society at large.&nbsp; However, we should give the Kongsi more flexibility to decide on the beneficiaries of its donations.&nbsp; Clause 10 of the Bill will amend the Ordinance to allow the Kongsi to contribute 25% of its income to Ngee Ann Polytechnic, 40% to other educational institutions and 10% to other charitable causes, maintaining a total of 75%.&nbsp; Giving the Kongsi greater flexibility in its income contributions will benefit more types of educational institutions and charitable causes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, the scale of the Kongsi's operation has also increased.&nbsp; There is therefore a need to review the way Ngee Ann Kongsi's income is computed.&nbsp; The Kongsi will incur operating expenses and depreciation cost in deriving the income.&nbsp; Such expenses should be deducted in the computation of income, in line with common accounting principles.&nbsp; Clause 10 therefore also clarifies the definition of the term \"income\" to mean net income, ie, the income after deducting operating expenses and depreciation cost.</p><p><br><I>Treatment of proceeds from sale or disposal of Ngee Ann Kongsi's assets</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the present Ordinance requires Ngee Ann Kongsi to donate 75% of all moneys arising from the disposition of any of its property and not just from recurring income.&nbsp; This will dilute the Kongsi's asset<p align=left>Column: 1266<p> base over time and reduce the capacity to generate income for future donations.&nbsp; It is in the long-term interest of potential beneficiaries that we encourage the Kongsi to grow and enhance its asset base, so that it can contribute more to society in the long run.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 10 will amend the Act to allow Ngee Ann Kongsi to re-invest the proceeds from the sale or disposal of its assets by excluding them from the definition of net income.&nbsp; This way, the Kongsi will be able to turn over its assets for better returns.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Management of Ngee Ann Kongsi's subsidiaries</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Ordinance does not specifically address the governance of subsidiary companies set up by the Kongsi.&nbsp; As a case in point, in 1989, Ngee Ann Kongsi transferred its leasehold interests in the piece of land at Ngee Ann City to Ngee Ann Development Pte Ltd (NAD) in exchange for 70% equity stake in NAD.&nbsp; As NAD is a separate independent legal entity from the Kongsi, it does not come under the direct purview of the Ordinance.&nbsp; It may undertake transactions detrimental to the interest of the Kongsi and its beneficiaries.&nbsp; For example, it is possible for NAD to disburse funds to organisations other than those provided for in the Ordinance.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to protect the interests of the educational institution beneficiaries under the Ordinance.&nbsp; The new section 20B, as provided for in clause 10, is designed to do that.&nbsp; We will now require Ngee Ann Kongsi and its appointed directors to exercise their voting rights in the Kongsi's subsidiaries in the interests of these beneficiaries.&nbsp; If this requirement is contravened in the passing of any resolution, then that resolution and any consequential action will be invalid and of no effect.&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1267<p><p><br><I>Composition and procedural issues of the Ngee Ann Kongsi Committee of Management</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the remainder of the Bill amends some composition and procedural issues of the Ngee Ann Kongsi Committee of Management which oversees the Kongsi's operations.&nbsp; These amendments are primarily administrative and procedural in nature and do not have policy implications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;Ngee Ann Kongsi has always demonstrated its unstinting commitment to Ngee Ann Polytechnic and for education in general.&nbsp; We need more of these organisations to step forward to work hand-in-hand with the Government to provide our students with a world-class education.&nbsp; I am confident that the amendment of the Ngee Ann Kongsi (Incorporation) Ordinance introduced under this Bill will allow Ngee Ann Kongsi more flexibility to promote the advancement of education in Singapore and bring about even greater benefits to the larger society.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.05 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the motion to amend the Ngee Ann Kongsi&nbsp;Ordinance.&nbsp; The Bill, steeped in history and moved in 1932 by Teochew migrant merchants who had made their fortunes here, had benefited the students of Ngee Ann Polytechnic for many years.&nbsp; The students have benefited from the handsome donation of 75% from the incomes of Ngee Ann Kongsi that was set up by the Teochew merchants to manage their affairs on a \"proper footing\".<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1268<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is through the vision and public-spirit&nbsp;mindedness of the early Teochew merchants that Ngee Ann Kongsi's fortunes are where they are today.&nbsp; We should also recognise that the fortunes of Ngee Ann Kongsi would not have been possible without the progress and development of Singapore and certainly even less possible without the support of the Singapore Government.&nbsp; For instance, Ngee Ann City, from which the Ngee Ann Kongsi derives much of its income, was originally bought as a burial ground for the Teochew community.&nbsp; The Teochew merchants then had the foresight to ride the growth and progress of Singapore and apply to the Government for a change of use.&nbsp; The Government approved the application and that resulted in the Ngee Ann City of today.&nbsp; Ngee Ann City is a major source of income for Ngee Ann Kongsi which has provided and would continue to provide much financial assistance towards the society.&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, it is timely for this House to put on record now our appreciation of the astute foresight of our generous early Teochew merchants, without which all these would not have been possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tan Cheng Lock, speaking in support of this Bill then, had hoped that other communities in Singapore would take similar steps.&nbsp; I am sure that many of the communal clans, associations and societies have benefited from the recent boom in property prices.&nbsp; Many of these clan associations' financial positions have ridden on the tailwind of progress that the buoyant Singapore economy has provided.&nbsp; I am told that many of these communal clans and associations have contributed to the Singapore society in their own ways with their very much improved financial positions.&nbsp; Although other communal clan associations, unlike the Teochews, who&nbsp;are doing their bit through an Act of Parliament, I am hopeful that they would continue to contribute more to education issues as well as to other charitable causes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1269<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, Ngee Ann Polytechnic has come a long way from its inception as Ngee Ann College in 1963, to Ngee Ann Technical College in 1972, and then to the present-day Ngee Ann Polytechnic.&nbsp; This institute of education has been transformed in more ways than just its name.&nbsp; Ngee Ann Polytechnic has moved from its early days of providing education opportunities to the children of the Teochew community.&nbsp; The student intake of Ngee Ann Polytechnic is now not only representative of the Singapore society but has taken on a cosmopolitan outlook.&nbsp; It now boasts of having international students&nbsp;within its fold.&nbsp; Also, the courses Ngee Ann Polytechnic currently provides have undergone substantial changes.&nbsp; It has now moved from just providing a handful of basic courses to incorporating cutting-edge science and technology courses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the earlier days, there were only two polytechnics: Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Singapore Polytechnic.&nbsp; Today, we have five polytechnics.&nbsp; And with polytechnic education as the preferred choice of post-secondary school students, it is timely the donations from Ngee Ann Kongsi go to benefit a broader student community.&nbsp; Hence, I support the move of 40% to other educational intents and purposes at the approval of the Education Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Education today is very much different from those days when Ngee Ann Kongsi decided to donate 75% of their incomes.&nbsp; Madam, the kind of support that the polytechnics need has evolved.&nbsp; The latest is for a majority of polytechnic students to be sent for overseas training; hence, the students would need more support.&nbsp; I am confident that the Teochew community, in general, and the Ngee Ann Kongsi management, in particular, would embrace this move towards helping students in a broader aspect with the donations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1270<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I also support the move to apportion 10% of the incomes of Ngee Ann Kongsi to benefit other charitable organisations.&nbsp; I firmly believe and am confident that Ngee Ann Kongsi would agree with me on these moves.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I welcome the Ngee Ann Kongsi (Incorporation) (Amendment) Bill, which allows the Ngee Ann Kongsi to channel its profits to other education and charitable causes other than just Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will give Ngee Ann Kongsi more flexibility to decide on&nbsp;the beneficiaries of its donations.&nbsp; However, of the 40% of its net income to other educational institutions, may I know whether it will be decided by MOE or Ngee Ann, and what are the criteria?&nbsp; And if it is decided by MOE, may I suggest that due credit&nbsp;be given to Ngee Ann?

It would not be possible for MOE to guarantee every student with a perfect score a place in his/her first-choice JC/polytechnic course.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, MOE will continue to regularly review the number of places in popular JCs and polytechnic courses, taking into account the aspirations of our students and the needs of our economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:WORKFORCE SKILLS QUALIFICATION SCHEME--><p align=left>Column: 1281<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:WORKFORCE SKILLS QUALIFICATION SCHEME:::1284--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>WORKFORCE SKILLS QUALIFICATION SCHEME</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad </B>&nbsp; asked the Minister for Manpower in respect of the Workforce Skills Qualification Scheme (a) which industries are still lagging in terms of employer participation in the scheme and take-up rates by employees; (b) what other efforts are being taken to encourage more Singaporeans to take up jobs in industries such as precision engineering.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) was introduced in 2004 and officially launched in 2005. It is a national skills certification framework developed by WDA in conjunction with industry and validated by employers. WDA has implemented 12 WSQ frameworks, in industries, such as Food &amp; Beverage (F&amp;B), Finance, Tourism and Precision Engineering, and will be developing WSQ in other sectors, such as the Creative Industries, Human Resources, Aerospace and Process Cluster Industries.&nbsp;<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA has been working closely with NTUC, various economic agencies and industry associations to promote the adoption of WSQ. The take-up has been encouraging. The implementation of WSQ in industries like Tourism and Retail is in full swing and many companies are embracing the WSQ standards. In 2006, over 41,000 workers upgraded their skills through the WSQ system.&nbsp; This increased to over 70,000 by May this year.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1283<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some industries, like Finance and ICT, the delivery infrastructure, such as training programmes, is still being developed so it will be several more months before we can see results. For Precision Engineering, the WSQ framework was launched in August 2006, with the first training intake admitted in April this year. In the first two months, eight workers obtained their WSQ qualification in Precision Engineering. As the Precision Engineering WSQ is relatively new, we will need to monitor and refine the implementation over time.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA is working with agencies, such as SPRING and EDB, to promote careers in Precision Engineering through career &amp; education fairs, as well as scholarship programmes to attract local talent into the industry. This is an industry which presents good job opportunities for locals.&nbsp; For example, an experienced machinist can earn up to $2,500 per month, including overtime pay, after working for a number of years.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA will continue to work closely with industry and NTUC to roll out WSQ in more sectors and encourage companies to adopt it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EMPLOYMENT OF WORKERS IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY--><p align=left>Column: 1283<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:EMPLOYMENT OF WORKERS IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY:::1284--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>EMPLOYMENT OF WORKERS IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Figures for Integrated Resorts and Formula One--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Figures for Integrated Resorts and Formula One)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad </B>asked the Minister for Manpower in light of Singapore's upcoming projects, such as the Integrated Resorts and Formula One (a) whether he will provide an update on the recruitment of workers in services sector jobs; and (b) what are the take-up rates for services sector jobs in the last one year and whether Singaporeans are taking up these jobs.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment in the services sector grew by 33,700 in Q1 2007, accounting for 68% of the 49,400 jobs created for the whole economy in the quarter. For the whole of 2006, 65% (73,700) of the 112,700 jobs created in services went to locals. In fact, four out of every five local job gains in 2006 came from the services sector.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the services sector continues to provide good employment opportunities for locals.&nbsp; To ensure its continued vibrancy, all tripartite partners have to play their part.&nbsp; Workers should upgrade their skills, especially through WDA's Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ), for the services sector. This will make it easier for employers to recognise qualifications relevant to their sector. To further raise standards in the services sector, WDA has built on the Go the Extra Mile for Service (GEMS) movement, launched in 2005, by extending the Customer-Centric Initiative, which originally covered the retail sector, to now include the food and beverage sector. In this tight labour market, employers are encouraged to explore ways of tapping on other sources of local labour, such as older workers or women.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS--><p align=left>Column: 1285<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</P></span></B></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS--><p align=left>Column: 1285<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS:::1286--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Figures on grades--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Figures on grades)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Siew Kum Hong </B>asked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance how many Administrative Officers are on (i) grades MR4 and above; (ii) grades SR9 up to, but excluding, MR4; and (iii) timescale.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Hsien Loong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 1st July 2007, there are a total of 234 Administrative Officers.

SLA and its agent, HDB, have put up 900 signboards at various State land sites. The signboards are placed mainly on sites designated for casual and recreational uses in residential estates, eg, Tanjong Rhu&nbsp;and Stadium Link and at locations where there have been past cases of illegal dumping, eg, Lim Chu Kang and Ponggol.&nbsp; As there are about 3,700 State land sites island-wide with an aggregate land area of 14,000 ha, it would not be practical to place such signs on every piece of State land.&nbsp; SLA has, therefore, concentrated its efforts in putting up signboards in residential estates as these are frequently used by the public.&nbsp; The signboards show the agency responsible for the maintenance of the land and the agency's contact number.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLA also has an up-to-date, one-stop online portal called LandQuery, from which the public can check the agencies responsible for the maintenance of all Government-owned land, including those owned by statutory boards.

As such, there are more than enough heavy vehicle parking spaces. Many of the excess lots are located in workplaces like factories and at designated places outside HDB estates where heavy vehicles are supposed to be parked in the first place.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, heavy vehicle drivers/owners prefer to park near their homes for greater convenience as they are using the heavy vehicles as a means of personal transport to get to and from work. This should not be encouraged as heavy vehicles driven through residential areas or parked close to residential premises create disamenities for residents. Besides being a traffic hazard, such vehicles generate noise and pollution. Hence, there are many complaints against allowing them to be parked near residential areas.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both HDB and URA had, in the past, provided a number of heavy vehicle parks on the outskirts of some HDB estates. It is, however, becoming more and more difficult to provide such facilities near HDB estates because of competing needs for the limited land near HDB estates. Nevertheless, where suitable sites are available and where it is viable to do so, my Ministry will consider providing a few more of such temporary heavy vehicle parks on vacant sites away from residential areas, on a case-by-case basis; and on the understanding that these heavy vehicle parks will have to be removed when the land is needed for future development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P>\t        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><p align=left>Column: 1289<p><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
