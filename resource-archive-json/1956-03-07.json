I  did\r\n\r\nadvise this House in my report on our official visit\r\n\r\nto London that we saw the British Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nat  that meeting indicated to him that we thought it\r\n\r\nmight  be  helpful  if  an  All-Party  Parliamentary\r\n\r\ndelegation  was sent to Singapore to  judge  of  the\r\n\r\nextent   and   genuineness   of   our   desire   for\r\n\r\nindependence.

They are the Rt. Hon. Geoffrey\r\n\r\nLloyd, who is the leader of the delegation, the  Rt.\r\n\r\nHon. H. S. Morrison, Mr G. J. M. Longden, Col.  Sir\r\n\r\nLeonard  Ropner,  Mr  A. J.

As Singapore is seeking the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  an  independent member  of  the  British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth,    the   Government   considered    it\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  invite all Dominion Governments  to\r\n\r\nsend parliamentary delegations, and the term of  the\r\n\r\ninvitation is that they may have the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nacquaint themselves fully on issues which may affect\r\n\r\nthem  arising  out  of our desire  for  independence\r\n\r\nwithin the Commonwealth.

Hart:</b> Sir, I have His Excellency s\r\n\r\npermission  to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has four principal aims: firstly, to\r\n\r\nassist  the mining industry in Malaya; secondly,  to\r\n\r\nafford an additional measure of relief to the rubber\r\n\r\nindustry;  thirdly, to simplify the  provisions  for\r\n\r\nthe   assessment  of  income  from  dividends;  and,\r\n\r\nlastly, to enable the Comptroller to obtain  a  full\r\n\r\ndisclosure of a person's total assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 is intended to give effect to the first\r\n\r\naim.  It  is  introduced in order to  encourage  the\r\n\r\nsearch  for fresh mineral deposits in Malaya.  Under\r\n\r\nthe existing provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance,\r\n\r\nrelief  is  allowable  for moneys  expended  on  the\r\n\r\nsearch   for   mineral  deposits  only  where   such\r\n\r\nexpenditure is incurred; firstly, by a miner  within\r\n\r\nthe  area  of  his  existing  lease,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhether  the prospecting is successful or otherwise;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  where the prospecting is  successful  and\r\n\r\nmining  operations  follow;  thirdly,  by  a  person\r\n\r\ncarrying  on a trade or business of prospecting  for\r\n\r\nmineral  deposits.  The expenditure  for  which  the\r\n\r\npresent  provisions of the Income Tax  Ordinance  do\r\n\r\nnot  give  relief  is  expenditure  on  unsuccessful\r\n\r\nprospecting incurred outside the area of a  miner's\r\n\r\nexisting lease. It is considered that if relief  for\r\n\r\nincome  tax  purposes is given in  respect  of  such\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  the discovery and development  of  the\r\n\r\nmineral  deposits  of Malaya will be  assisted.  The\r\n\r\nclause  is designed to give such relief. It will  be\r\n\r\nseen  that,  to qualify for relief, the  prospecting\r\n\r\nexpenditure   must   be  lawfully   incurred.   This\r\n\r\nrestriction  has been inserted to ensure  that  only\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  duly  authorised  to  engage   in\r\n\r\nprospecting  shall be in a position to claim  relief\r\n\r\nfor their expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the next aim, hon. Members will\r\n\r\nremember  that  one  of the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nmission  of  enquiry  into the  rubber  industry - the\r\n\r\nMudie  Mission - was that all new capital  expenditure\r\n\r\non  estates  should be written off  for  income  tax\r\n\r\npurposes over a maximum period of ten years.  Clause\r\n\r\n4  is intended to implement that recommendation. The\r\n\r\nrelief which may be claimed under the provisions  of\r\n\r\nclause  4  is  available to any  person  engaged  in\r\n\r\nworking  a  plantation.  The  word  \"plantation\"  is\r\n\r\ndefined in Section 2 of the Income Tax Ordinance  to\r\n\r\nmean any land used for the growing and harvesting of\r\n\r\ncrops,  and,  accordingly, the  relief  proposed  is\r\n\r\nequally available to the rubber, oil palm, rice, tea\r\n\r\nand cocoa industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifying expenditure will be divided into ten\r\n\r\nequal  parts, and will be available for  relief  for\r\n\r\neach  of the ten years of assessment following  that\r\n\r\nin  which the expenditure is incurred. Paragraph (3)\r\n\r\nof  the clause makes provision for the allocation of\r\n\r\nthe  relief as between the vendor and the  purchaser\r\n\r\nwhere  land is sold, on which qualifying expenditure\r\n\r\nhas been incurred. Thus, if the whole or part of  an\r\n\r\nestate  is  sold  within any  ten-year  period,  the\r\n\r\npurchaser  is entitled to claim, over the  remaining\r\n\r\nyears  of  the period, the same amount of relief  as\r\n\r\nwas  allowed  annually to the vendor, provided  that\r\n\r\nthe estate or part of the estate purchased continues\r\n\r\nto  be  used  as  a plantation. The relief  afforded\r\n\r\nunder  the  clause is generous, and it is considered\r\n\r\nreasonable that where the whole or part of an estate\r\n\r\nin respect of which relief has been given is sold or\r\n\r\ntransferred  for a consideration, the vendor  should\r\n\r\npay  tax on any sum which he recovers in respect  of\r\n\r\nhis expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proviso to the clause introduces two safeguards\r\n\r\nfor  the  taxpayer where the whole  or  part  of  an\r\n\r\nestate is sold. Firstly, the sum recovered on  which\r\n\r\nthe  vendor is required to pay tax is restricted  to\r\n\r\nthe  amount of the allowances which he has  obtained\r\n\r\nunder  the clause. Secondly, the taxpayer  is  given\r\n\r\nthe option of having any sum so recovered treated as\r\n\r\nincome of the year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  receipt,  or  spread evenly  over  such  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  years  of assessment as are  in  date  for\r\n\r\nadditional assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (2) of the clause provides that capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  the acquisition of land,  machinery\r\n\r\nand  plant shall not qualify for relief. In the case\r\n\r\nof  machinery  and  plant,  the  existing  rates  of\r\n\r\ndepreciation,  which  have been  prescribed  by  the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Board of Income Tax, are considered  to  be\r\n\r\nadequate, but Section 19 of the Ordinance gives  any\r\n\r\ntaxpayer, who is dissatisfied with these rates,  the\r\n\r\nright  to  approach the Comptroller with  a  request\r\n\r\nthat higher rates should be allowed. Land used as  a\r\n\r\nplantation  is  not considered to be a deteriorating\r\n\r\nasset  and, for that reason, is excluded from relief\r\n\r\nunder the clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words on the provisions of paragraph (6) of\r\n\r\nclause 4 may be of assistance to hon. Members. Under\r\n\r\nthe existing provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance,\r\n\r\ncapital expenditure incurred on the construction  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  buildings and structures on  plantations\r\n\r\nqualifies for relief as follows - an initial allowance\r\n\r\nof  ten  per  cent  is  given together  with  annual\r\n\r\nallowances at the rate of two per cent for a maximum\r\n\r\nperiod of 45 years. No relief is due for expenditure\r\n\r\non  clearing new areas or for original planting. The\r\n\r\nwhole  cost of replanting, on the other hand,  which\r\n\r\nmeans  the  replacement of the crop on any  area  of\r\n\r\nland by a similar or by an approved crop on the same\r\n\r\narea  of  land,  is  allowable  as  a  deduction  in\r\n\r\ncomputing   profits  as  and  when   incurred.   The\r\n\r\nprovisions of paragraph (6) of clause 4 of the  Bill\r\n\r\ndo  not  interfere  with the existing  treatment  of\r\n\r\nreplanting expenditure. The provisions do,  however,\r\n\r\nenable  expenditure on clearing  new  areas  and  on\r\n\r\noriginal planting to qualify for relief over a  ten-year  period; furthermore, the provisions  are  more\r\n\r\ngenerous  in  the case of industrial  buildings  and\r\n\r\nstructures in that relief may now be claimed over  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  period  of ten years instead  of  over  the\r\n\r\nexisting maximum of 45 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aim is carried out in clauses 5 and 6 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  Clause  5  is  designed  to  remove  the\r\n\r\ncomplicated     provisions     applicable      where\r\n\r\nshareholdings giving rise to dividends are  acquired\r\n\r\nor  are  sold  by  making all income from  dividends\r\n\r\nassessable  on the basis of the amount  received  in\r\n\r\nthe  preceding year. At present, when a  holding  of\r\n\r\nshares  is  acquired, dividends received during  the\r\n\r\nfirst  or  second year of assessment may be assessed\r\n\r\nto  tax  more  than once, and the tax deducted  from\r\n\r\nsuch dividends by the paying company may require  to\r\n\r\nbe  set off for the purposes of collection or repaid\r\n\r\nto  the taxpayer more than once. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nwhen a holding of shares is sold, the provisions  of\r\n\r\nsubsection  (7)  of  Section 31 of  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance   have  the  effect  that  the   dividends\r\n\r\nreceived in the second last, or the third last, year\r\n\r\nof  assessment are not assessed to tax at all.  Over\r\n\r\nthe   period  during  which  shares  are  held,  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  may be assessed in a greater  amount  than\r\n\r\nthe   aggregate  dividends  he  has  received.   The\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  clause 5 will ensure that  over  the\r\n\r\nperiod during which shares are held the taxpayer  is\r\n\r\nassessed  only  on  the exact  amount  of  dividends\r\n\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 is intended to meet the request of several\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the accountancy profession for  a  more\r\n\r\nsimple  procedure  in  the  deduction  of  tax  from\r\n\r\ndividends   paid  to  shareholders.  The   practical\r\n\r\ndifficulties  encountered in the  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting provisions of Section 40 are referred to in\r\n\r\nthe  Objects and Reasons attached to the  Bill.  The\r\n\r\nbroad  principle underlying the new clause  is  that\r\n\r\nevery company resident in the Colony is entitled  to\r\n\r\ndeduct  tax  from  dividends paid  to  shareholders,\r\n\r\nregardless of whether or not the company itself  has\r\n\r\nchargeable  income  for the year  of  assessment  in\r\n\r\nwhich any dividend is paid, provided that the tax so\r\n\r\ndeducted from the dividends reaches the Revenue. For\r\n\r\nthis purpose, the excess of any tax paid on previous\r\n\r\nprofits   over   the  tax  deducted  from   previous\r\n\r\ndividends  is available, along with the tax  payable\r\n\r\nfor the year of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessment in which the dividend is paid,  to  frank\r\n\r\nthe  tax  deducted  from the current  dividend;  but\r\n\r\nwhere  there is no such excess, the deficiency  must\r\n\r\nbe  made good by a direct payment to the Comptroller\r\n\r\nof Income Tax. In effect, two running totals will be\r\n\r\nkept for each company. One will be the total of  tax\r\n\r\npaid each year on the company's income for all years\r\n\r\nof  assessment from the date of the introduction  of\r\n\r\nincome  tax in 1948. The other will be the total  of\r\n\r\ntax  deducted  from dividends in  the  same  period.\r\n\r\nProvided  that  the total of tax  paid  exceeds  the\r\n\r\ntotal  of  tax  deducted, the  company  will  be  in\r\n\r\nperfect  safety in deducting tax from its dividends,\r\n\r\nand only where the tax deducted exceeds the tax paid\r\n\r\nwill  the  company  be  required  to  make  up   the\r\n\r\ndifference  by a direct payment. This  procedure  is\r\n\r\nperfectly reasonable when one bears in mind that the\r\n\r\ntax  deducted from a dividend is available for  set-off  or for repayment when the relevant dividend  is\r\n\r\nassessed  on  the  shareholder. Furthermore,  it  is\r\n\r\nthought  that  the procedure will  prove  to  be  of\r\n\r\nassistance  to directors and to company secretaries,\r\n\r\nsince they will no longer be uncertain whether  they\r\n\r\nare entitled to deduct tax on paying a dividend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to remove from\r\n\r\nSection 40 the restriction whereby the rate  of  tax\r\n\r\nat  which  a company is entitled to deduct tax  from\r\n\r\ndividends  is  reduced by any Double or  Empire  Tax\r\n\r\nRelief received by the company. The amount of Double\r\n\r\nor  Empire  Tax  received by any single  company  is\r\n\r\ncomparatively small, and the effect of reducing  the\r\n\r\nrate at which companies may deduct tax - at present 30\r\n\r\nper cent - to take account of such relief, is to bring\r\n\r\ninto  existence  percentages, for  example,  29.18%,\r\n\r\n28.97%,   which  are  troublesome  to  compute   and\r\n\r\ndifficult to explain to shareholders. The removal of\r\n\r\nthe restriction will result in the total of tax paid\r\n\r\nby any company receiving Double or Empire Tax Relief\r\n\r\nbeing  correspondingly reduced for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\ncomparison with the total of tax deducted  from  the\r\n\r\ndividends paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four amendments which I have mentioned have\r\n\r\nbeen  considered by the Malayan Board of Income  Tax\r\n\r\nwho have advised that they should be introduced with\r\n\r\neffect   from  the  first  of  January,  1956.   The\r\n\r\nFederation Government has also accepted this  advice\r\n\r\nand  proposes to include the same amendments in  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax Bill which is to be introduced into  the\r\n\r\nFederal Legislative Council this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will no doubt be aware that one or two\r\n\r\npoints have been raised during the past few days  by\r\n\r\nthe   accountancy  profession  in  regard   to   the\r\n\r\noperation of sub-clause (6) of clause 6 of the  Bill\r\n\r\nto which I have just referred. These objections were\r\n\r\nconcerned  with certain results which, it was  felt,\r\n\r\nmight flow where a company had a surplus of tax paid\r\n\r\nas  at  31st  December, 1955. It was  thought  that,\r\n\r\nwhere  dividends had been paid partly out of profits\r\n\r\nwhich  had  not suffered Singapore tax, or  where  a\r\n\r\ndividend  had been paid during the period  when  the\r\n\r\nrate  deductible was 20 per cent only, the provision\r\n\r\nfor grossing up at 30 per cent would have the effect\r\n\r\nof reducing arbitrarily the credit balance of tax in\r\n\r\nhand.  These  points have since been discussed  with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of the accountancy profession,  and\r\n\r\nit  is proposed to amend the sub-clause in Committee\r\n\r\nin  such a way as to remove any possibility of these\r\n\r\ndifficulties arising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of what should be done about companies\r\n\r\nwhich,  in the past, had deducted tax from dividends\r\n\r\nin  excess of the tax paid on their profits was also\r\n\r\nraised,  and  I  am able to reinforce the  assurance\r\n\r\nwhich    has   been   given   to   the   accountancy\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  that no action  be  taken  in  such\r\n\r\ncases.  In  other words, such companies  will  start\r\n\r\nafresh  as  from  the year of assessment  1956.  The\r\n\r\nassurance which I have just given was recommended by\r\n\r\nand agreed to at the meeting of the Malayan Board of\r\n\r\nIncome Tax at which the amendments embodied in  this\r\n\r\nBill were discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section - Section\r\n\r\n6lA - into the Income Tax Ordinance. In the course  of\r\n\r\nthe debate on the Income Tax (Amendment)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill, 1953, a Select Committee was appointed in 1953\r\n\r\nto  examine and report to the Legislative Council on\r\n\r\nthat  Bill. The Select Committee recommended - their\r\n\r\nReport  is in Council Paper No. 73 of 1953 - that  all\r\n\r\nthe  clauses of the Bill should be accepted with the\r\n\r\nexception of clause 8 which sought to introduce  two\r\n\r\nnew  sections  into the Ordinance, namely,  Sections\r\n\r\n61A  and  61B. Clause 8 of the 1953 Bill  containing\r\n\r\nthese sections was accordingly deleted from the Bill\r\n\r\nas  enacted.  It is not intended to reintroduce  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  Section 61B. Government  is  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion, however, that the proposed new Section 61A,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  contained in clause 7  of  the  Bill,  is\r\n\r\nessential  if  the  attack  on  evasion  is  to   be\r\n\r\nseriously  pressed. The clause gives the Comptroller\r\n\r\nstatutory  authority to require from any taxpayer  a\r\n\r\nstatement   containing  particulars  of   all   bank\r\n\r\naccounts,  assets and any other facts  bearing  upon\r\n\r\nhis  income tax liability. The statement is intended\r\n\r\nto  enable the Comptroller to compare the growth  of\r\n\r\nthe  tax-payer's  wealth over  a  period  with  his\r\n\r\ndeclared  income in the same period. I would  assure\r\n\r\nhon. Members that the section will be used only  by\r\n\r\nthe   Comptroller  or  by  senior  officers  of  the\r\n\r\nInvestigation   Unit  in  cases   where   fraud   is\r\n\r\nsuspected.  The section will not be used to  require\r\n\r\nstatements  of wealth from all and sundry,  and  the\r\n\r\nhonest  tax-payer need have no fear that  the  new\r\n\r\npowers  will be used indiscriminately to compel  him\r\n\r\nto supply information about his private affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the provisions of clause 7 in the\r\n\r\npresent  Bill were enacted in the Federation  Income\r\n\r\nTax  (Amendment) Ordinance, 1953,  and  are  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime  omitted  from  the  Singapore  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance  has  proved a source of embarrassment  to\r\n\r\nthe officers working in  the  Investigation Unit in Singapore. This  Unit\r\n\r\nhas  recently been strengthened by the  addition  of\r\n\r\nthree  officers from the Board of Inland Revenue  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom, and I feel sure  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwill  agree  that Government is right in seeking  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  Comptroller  and to  these  officers  the\r\n\r\nweapon  of the additional powers contained in clause\r\n\r\n7 to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  battle  against  tax  evaders  is\r\n\r\neffectively  waged.  As  I have  already  said,  the\r\n\r\nhonest  citizen need have no fear of the  additional\r\n\r\npowers:  only the evader need have cause for  alarm,\r\n\r\nand he is undeserving of the sympathy of Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, with this new clause 61A, it\r\n\r\nmay  possibly be argued that since clause 69 (1)  of\r\n\r\nthe main Ordinance limits the Comptroller's power to\r\n\r\nraise additional assessment to a period of six years\r\n\r\nfrom the year of assessment in respect of which  tax\r\n\r\nis  due,  logically  clause  61A  should  limit  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  s  power to call  for  a  statement  of\r\n\r\nbanking  accounts,  etc. to the  same  period.  This\r\n\r\nargument appears to overlook the fact that clause 69\r\n\r\n(1)   refers,   in   the  main,  to  straightforward\r\n\r\nadditional assessments whereas clause 61A  is  aimed\r\n\r\nat  evaders of tax. It also overlooks the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  proviso to clause 69 (1) already recognises the\r\n\r\nfact  that the Comptroller should have the power  to\r\n\r\npursue  an evader of tax to the limits of the Income\r\n\r\nTax  Ordinance,  that  is,  to  the  first  year  of\r\n\r\nassessment   under   the   Ordinance.    In    these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  no justification  can  be  seen  for\r\n\r\nattempting  to limit the exercise of the Comptroller's  powers under clause 61A to a period of six  years\r\n\r\npreceding  the  year  in  which  evasion  is   first\r\n\r\nsuspected. It must not be forgotten that this clause\r\n\r\nrefers  to evaders of tax and not to honest citizens\r\n\r\nwho  have nothing to fear from this clause. I should\r\n\r\nalso  point  out that a clause similar  to  the  new\r\n\r\nclause  61A  has been in operation in the Federation\r\n\r\nsince 1953, and no need has been felt there to alter\r\n\r\nthe date from 1st January, 1947.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it may be argued that since taxpayers had\r\n\r\nthe  right, under Section 31(1), to choose  1948  as\r\n\r\nthe  basis year for the year of assessment 1948,  it\r\n\r\nshould  be  made  clear  in  clause  6lA  that,  for\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  who  so  opted,  the  critical  date  for\r\n\r\npurposes of clause 61A should be 1st January, 1948,\r\n\r\nand  not  1st January, 1947. Here again, I must  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Comptroller  must have  power  to  pursue\r\n\r\nevaders throughout the whole\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod of the Income Tax Ordinance, and I should  be\r\n\r\nunwilling to agree that any amendment should be made\r\n\r\nin  this  respect.  As I have repeated  before,  the\r\n\r\nhonest  taxpayer  has  nothing  to  fear  from  this\r\n\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, clause 8 provides for certain\r\n\r\nconsequential  amendments to the main Ordinance  and\r\n\r\nthese are described in detail in the Schedule.

Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary to let us know whether\r\n\r\nthis section exists in the United Kingdom Income Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I assume my hon. Friend means Section 61A?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> indicated assent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> My information, Sir, is that such a\r\n\r\nclause  does not exist in the Income Tax law in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom,  but  I  would  say  that  in  this\r\n\r\nparticular respect I see no reason why we should  be\r\n\r\nguided by the practice in the United Kingdom.  After\r\n\r\nall, Sir, the object of this legislation here is  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  needs  of Singapore and  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nevasion of tax in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish  to make it clear that we are not against  this\r\n\r\nBill  in principle. Indeed we welcome any step which\r\n\r\nwould  encourage people to invest in  industry.  The\r\n\r\nmain  object of this Bill is to make our fiscal laws\r\n\r\nmore  in line with those of the Federation, and  one\r\n\r\ncan hardly object to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only doubt that I have in my mind is the\r\n\r\nproposed amendment to Section 61A which the Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary  has  just  mentioned.  No  one\r\n\r\nobjects  to more powers being given to the  officers\r\n\r\nof  the  Income Tax Department in order  to  prevent\r\n\r\npeople from evading payment of their just taxes  and\r\n\r\nmaking a full disclosure of all their properties. We\r\n\r\nwelcome  and warmly support it. But the  point  goes\r\n\r\nbeyond  that.  Under  this proposed  amendment,  the\r\n\r\npower is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  sought  for Income Tax officers to demand  bank\r\n\r\naccounts and a statement of assets up to the 1st  of\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1947, which means, Sir, that as the  years\r\n\r\npass  by - 10 or 20 years - the unfortunate small trader\r\n\r\nor  anyone  may be suddenly called upon to  disclose\r\n\r\nhis full assets. This means, in effect, that it will\r\n\r\nnot be safe for anyone to destroy the records of his\r\n\r\ntransactions  as  from 1947.  This,  I  submit  is  a\r\n\r\ntremendous burden put on the innocent man.  You  are\r\n\r\npenalising  him  as well as the  man  whom  you  are\r\n\r\nchasing for not having paid his taxes. In the normal\r\n\r\ncourse  of  events, I think people  have  relied  on\r\n\r\nSection 69 whereby the Income Tax officer is allowed\r\n\r\nto  ask for six years  assessment, but in this  case\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  limit. You have the  period  of  time\r\n\r\nincreasing,  and because we are giving extraordinary\r\n\r\npowers  to the officers of the Income Tax Department\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not included in the Income Tax  laws  of\r\n\r\nEngland,  where  they have more experience  of  such\r\n\r\nmatters,  then, I submit, Members of  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nmust examine these powers very carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax officer has, at the present moment,\r\n\r\nthe  right  to call for accounts, and non-fulfilment\r\n\r\nof  this  request  or refusal to  comply  with  this\r\n\r\nrequest is not an offence under the Income Tax laws.\r\n\r\nWith  this proposed amendment, it becomes an offence\r\n\r\nnot to submit one's statement of account. The Income\r\n\r\nTax officer can, under the present law, make a heavy\r\n\r\nassessment  on the taxpayer who will  then  have  to\r\n\r\njustify his claim that his income is not as high  as\r\n\r\nhas  been assessed, and to be able to justify  that,\r\n\r\nhe will have to produce his books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the tax laws of the United Kingdom and\r\n\r\nthe  United  States of America, the period  for  the\r\n\r\nComptroller to assess and demand payment of  tax  is\r\n\r\nlimited to six years by Section 69, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where it appears to the Comptroller that any\r\n\r\nperson  liable to tax has not been assessed  or  has\r\n\r\nbeen assessed at a less amount than that which ought\r\n\r\nto  have  been charged, the Comptroller may,  within\r\n\r\nthe year of assessment or within six years after the\r\n\r\nexpiration  thereof,  assess  such  person  at  such\r\n\r\namount or additional amount as according to his judg-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nment ought to have been charged, and the provisions\r\n\r\nof this Ordinance as to notice of assessment, appeal\r\n\r\nand other proceedings... shall apply to such assessment...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in all wisdom, the practice of allowing the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  officer a free hand during this  period\r\n\r\nhas  been going on for hundreds of years in England,\r\n\r\nand  where we are imposing a special law,  I  submit\r\n\r\nthat we should be guided by this section. The period\r\n\r\nshould be fixed - six years or ten years if you  like,\r\n\r\nI do not mind - but I do not feel that a man should be\r\n\r\nheld to ransom in that at any time during the period\r\n\r\nof  his  business life he might be  called  upon  to\r\n\r\ndisclose   his   accounts  which  he  has   probably\r\n\r\ndestroyed. It is intolerable to make a man keep  his\r\n\r\naccount books for the next 10 or 20 years. It may be\r\n\r\nphysically  impossible - he has not got the  space  in\r\n\r\nhis  shop - and  it  may not be possible  for  him  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  decaying influence of time  and  white\r\n\r\nants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the proposed amendment in asking for power\r\n\r\nto  extend to the first of January, 1947,  does  not\r\n\r\nmake  provision for those who have elected  1948  as\r\n\r\nthe  first year of assessment instead of 1947, which\r\n\r\nthey  are allowed under Section 31 of the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nIf he has elected to be taxed on his 1948 account, I\r\n\r\nfail  to  see how he can be called for his statement\r\n\r\nfor  1947.  Also it does not mean that, by  limiting\r\n\r\nthe  Income  Tax officer to a period of six  or  ten\r\n\r\nyears,  that  officer  is debarred  absolutely  from\r\n\r\nfurther action. He still has his right to pursue the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  under the law, as pointed out by the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe  Financial  Secretary. During those  six  years,\r\n\r\nsurely if his work has been done efficiently or  his\r\n\r\noffice  has  been run efficiently, there  should  be\r\n\r\nsome knowledge of wilful non-return of a declaration\r\n\r\nof  assets, and steps should have been taken to call\r\n\r\non  the  man to make a full statement of his account\r\n\r\nand criminal proceedings instituted against him.  If\r\n\r\nyou  institute criminal proceedings and there is  no\r\n\r\ntime bar to that course being taken, then the Income\r\n\r\nTax  officer can apply to the Court for an order for\r\n\r\nthe  books  to  be examined or for  copies  of  bank\r\n\r\nstatements  to be produced by the bank. I therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  give  notice that I shall move  the  requisite\r\n\r\namendment in the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Financial Secretary  has  said  that\r\n\r\nSection  61A, quoted in clause 7 of the  Bill,  does\r\n\r\nnot  exist in the United Kingdom and yet Section 61A\r\n\r\nis being introduced in this Bill. Sir, I am strongly\r\n\r\nagainst  the adoption of this section for Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  Comptroller should not be allowed  to  exercise\r\n\r\nhis  power under this section until he can establish\r\n\r\nprima  facie  evidence  to  prove  that  the  person\r\n\r\nconcerned is evading taxation. We feel that, in line\r\n\r\nwith our concept of personal freedom in a democratic\r\n\r\ncountry,  any  law that attempts to  limit  personal\r\n\r\nfreedom  should  not be enacted  except  under  very\r\n\r\nspecial circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

The Government of this country, Sir,\r\n\r\nhas been cheated every year since 1947, and the bulk\r\n\r\nof  its loss is not on the part of the small traders\r\n\r\nfor  whom  the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr  Lim  Koon\r\n\r\nTeck)  has shown such concern. The bulk of the  loss\r\n\r\ncomes from the people whom we are now seeking to pin\r\n\r\ndown, and they are the very wealthy concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have added to our staff three experts from\r\n\r\nthe British Board of Inland Revenue in the detection\r\n\r\nof  evaders. They are there now and they are set for\r\n\r\nthis  campaign to get back some of the dreadful loss\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have suffered, and also in order  to  see\r\n\r\nthat   in  the  future  that  loss  is  considerably\r\n\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full sympathy with the principles of both\r\n\r\nthe  objections  raised - on the one  hand,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience   of  maintaining  records   over   an\r\n\r\nindefinite  period; on the other hand, the  question\r\n\r\nof the violation of individual liberty without prima\r\n\r\nfacie  evidence. But we have before us, Sir, special\r\n\r\ncircumstances - circumstances which are freely acknowledged - and the\r\n\r\nblame for these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances has been primarily laid at  the  doors\r\n\r\nof  our  own  Income  Tax  Department.

Today, on this small issue of the  proposed\r\n\r\nSection  61A,  under clause 7 of the Bill,  we  have\r\n\r\nclear  evidence - if  evidence is needed - more  than  just\r\n\r\nprima  facie  evidence what particular interests  the\r\n\r\nLiberal  Socialists represent. I am certain that  it\r\n\r\nis  not  just mere coincidence that our  friend  the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) should  find\r\n\r\nhimself  so close to the Members for Paya Lebar  and\r\n\r\nfor Tiong Bahru.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plain fact is this. Everybody says tax evasion\r\n\r\nis bad for the Government. Every accountant has, and\r\n\r\nI should imagine the Hon. the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nhimself  has,  personal knowledge of the  great  joy\r\n\r\nwith  which  this  sport  of evading,  lawfully  and\r\n\r\nlegitimately,  the income tax laws is  indulged  in.\r\n\r\nBut  what  we object to is not the sport of  dodging\r\n\r\nthe  income tax man within his rules and regulations\r\n\r\nbut  of having more than one set of accounts. It  is\r\n\r\nalso common knowledge that many business enterprises\r\n\r\nin  Singapore keep three sets of accounts. I thought\r\n\r\nthere were two. As a matter of fact, I suggested  to\r\n\r\nthe  proprietor of a particularly large concern that\r\n\r\nperhaps what he was offering to the union might  not\r\n\r\nbe  the accounts which he offered to show his  wife,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  or  his brother!  Then,  with  great\r\n\r\nindignation,  he  said that  that  was  the  set  of\r\n\r\naccounts with which he had satisfied the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment! On leaving the premises of the employer,\r\n\r\nmy  union  friend turned round to me and  said,  \"Of\r\n\r\ncourse, you know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  actually has another set of accounts,  and  this\r\n\r\none  he only shows to himself!

But we  are  somewhat\r\n\r\ntaken  aback  when the Member for Tiong  Bahru  (Mr\r\n\r\nWilliam Tan), speaking for the same Party now,  says\r\n\r\nthat he objects to the whole principle of it. \"Prove\r\n\r\nme  a crook first! Give me some prima facie evidence\r\n\r\nthat  I am a crook, and then you can call for  these\r\n\r\naccounts!\" Sir, I thought the whole purpose of  this\r\n\r\noperation is to get prima facie evidence that he  is\r\n\r\na  crook,  or that someone is a crook! The People's\r\n\r\nAction Party says, \"Let the Government have all  the\r\n\r\npowers  to prove as many crooks guilty as  they  can\r\n\r\nget their hands on!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhad  not  intended to speak on this issue  since  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues have already spoken, but my Party  having\r\n\r\nbeen  referred  to by the P.A.P., I think  I  should\r\n\r\ntake  the Floor to make our stand clear.

[Interruption] I\r\n\r\nhave mixed with a large number of small shopkeepers - shopkeepers  with probably a capital  of  $2,000  to\r\n\r\n$5,000,  doing their business as a family affair.  I\r\n\r\nhave  known that tax forms have been sent  to  them,\r\n\r\nand  in  many cases many of these people  have  been\r\n\r\nhauled  up  to  show cause why they  should  not  be\r\n\r\nassessed at a big sum, and later on again to say why\r\n\r\nthey  should  not show their accounts further  back.\r\n\r\nSir,  if  you compare the number of cases where  the\r\n\r\nbig people and the small people have been hauled  up\r\n\r\nby  the Income Tax Department, I think you will find\r\n\r\nthat it is the small people that have been hauled up\r\n\r\nvery much more often. Again I would put this to you,\r\n\r\nSir. In quite a number of cases, a small shopkeeper\r\n\r\nhas  been  hauled up and after his income  has  been\r\n\r\nexamined, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfound  that he is not taxable.

I  feel\r\n\r\nthat when we think about a provision of this nature,\r\n\r\nwhich we hope will affect only the big fish, we must\r\n\r\nalso  make sure that the very small shopkeepers  are\r\n\r\nnot going to be inconvenienced unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I should, perhaps, amplify my remarks.  In\r\n\r\n1952  we  managed to secure the services of  a  very\r\n\r\nsenior  member  of  the Board of Inland  Revenue  to\r\n\r\nstudy and report on the question of evasion. He  had\r\n\r\nserved  upwards of 35 years on the Board  of  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue.  One of his main recommendations  was  that\r\n\r\nthis  particular section should be written into  the\r\n\r\nlaw  of the two territories. There was  man of great\r\n\r\nexperience  of income tax law and procedure  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom recommending that this provision  is\r\n\r\nrequired and is necessary in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, points have been made about the trouble which\r\n\r\nwill be entailed in keeping accounts back to 1947. I\r\n\r\nmyself  do  not see how the anxieties of which  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  have spoken  in the debate can  arise.  Any\r\n\r\nhonest  citizen who keeps his  books in  the  normal\r\n\r\nway and pays his tax when it is due, need do no more\r\n\r\nthan  conduct his business operations in the way  he\r\n\r\nhas always done, destroying the books as and when  he\r\n\r\nthinks fit, because he will be certain in  his  own\r\n\r\nmind  that the Income Tax Department will never,  in\r\n\r\nany  circumstances, have reason  to  call  for   his\r\n\r\naccounts.  The only people who will  be  placed  in\r\n\r\nsome doubt as to what they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  do with their accounts are those people  who\r\n\r\neither  have  evaded tax or who  have  been  on  the\r\n\r\nborders  of  evasion and they certainly should  keep\r\n\r\ntheir  accounts right back to 1947. But  as  regards\r\n\r\nthe  large  body of honest citizens, this provision,\r\n\r\nas far as the keeping of accounts is concerned, will\r\n\r\ncause   no  trouble  whatsoever.  They  will  merely\r\n\r\ncontinue to organise and conduct their business, and\r\n\r\nkeep  and  destroy their accounts in the  way  they\r\n\r\nhave always done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the question has been raised - as I suggested\r\n\r\nin  my  speech that it might be raised - that, because\r\n\r\nthe powers of the Comptroller under Section 69  (1)\r\n\r\nare  limited to a period of six years, logically the\r\n\r\npowers of the Comptroller under this new Section 61A\r\n\r\nshould be limited to a similar period. The argument,\r\n\r\nin my opinion, is fallacious, Sir, because there is\r\n\r\nno   connection   between  the   two   functions - the\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the Comptroller under Section  69  (1)\r\n\r\nand  the functions of the Comptroller under this new\r\n\r\nSection  61A. Under Section 69 (1), the  Comptroller\r\n\r\nmerely  raises  additional assessments  in  a  plain\r\n\r\nstraightforward  manner in plain straight  forward\r\n\r\ncases.  But you will note, Sir, that under  Section\r\n\r\n69  (1)  there  is a proviso which says  that  where\r\n\r\nthere   has  been  fraud  or  wilful  default,   the\r\n\r\nComptroller may pursue his enquiries right  back  to\r\n\r\nthe  beginning of the Income Tax Ordinance. In other\r\n\r\nwords, the Legislature has in the past admitted  the\r\n\r\nright,  in  the  case of evasion or  fraud,  of  the\r\n\r\nComptroller to pursue his enquiries as far  back  as\r\n\r\nhe  may  go.  Correspondingly, when  we  suggest  in\r\n\r\nSection 61A that he may pursue his enquiries back to\r\n\r\nthe  first  of January, 1947, we are doing  no  more\r\n\r\nthan  stating  once  more the  power  which  he  has\r\n\r\nalready been given under this particular section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there is the question - as I again\r\n\r\nsuspected might be raised - that if under Section  31\r\n\r\na taxpayer has opted that 1948 should be regarded as\r\n\r\nthe basis year of assessment, the Comptroller should\r\n\r\nbe precluded from investigating back to the first of\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1947. The answer to that argument,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,  is  that  if there is evasion,  it  should  be\r\n\r\ntracked  down  to  the limits of the  Comptroller's\r\n\r\npower.  That  is  the  crux of the  matter,  Sir - the\r\n\r\nprevention and detection of evasion - and in so far as\r\n\r\nwe here represent honest citizens and not evaders or\r\n\r\nwrongdoers,  this  section of the  Ordinance  should\r\n\r\nreceive  the  full support of the  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.

I think it has been fairly\r\n\r\nwell  debated  and  ventilated so  far.  There  are,\r\n\r\nhowever,  one  or two points that I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is this, Sir. The Hon. the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  has  said that under Section  69,  as  it\r\n\r\nstands  at  present,  there is power  given  to  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  to  pursue any tax-payer  suspected  of\r\n\r\nevasion to the limit. If that is so, I really cannot\r\n\r\nsee  why there is any objection to a limit being put\r\n\r\nhere, where we are giving him excess power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that I want to make is this - that\r\n\r\nunder  my  amendment, the year will not be 1941,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister indicated just now, but it  will\r\n\r\nbe  1949. My amendment says that the power  to  call\r\n\r\nfor  these  accounts  and  statement  of  assets  is\r\n\r\nlimited  to a period of six years prior to the  year\r\n\r\nof assessment. The year of assessment is always\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  12  months  preceding that  year  when  tax  is\r\n\r\nleviable.  Take,  for example, this  year - 1956.  The\r\n\r\nyear  of  assessment is 1955, and a six-year  period\r\n\r\nwill take it up to 1949.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main purpose in asking for a limited period is\r\n\r\nthat  I  feel sure that by such a limit the officers\r\n\r\nin  the Income Tax Department will be kept on  their\r\n\r\ntoes  and  be  very  thorough  and  quick  in  their\r\n\r\nexamination  of accounts, instead of letting  things\r\n\r\nslide   and   taking  them  up  many,   many   years\r\n\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, \"That the words proposed to be\r\n\r\nleft out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

It occurred in my  own  office\r\n\r\nwhere  a person charged with a crime put up a story,\r\n\r\nand I said, \"If this is true, it will help the Court\r\n\r\nimmeasurably  to believe it if you can produce  your\r\n\r\naccounts.\"  And  through my clerk, he  said,  \"Which\r\n\r\nset,  Sir?\" Very naively, I said to the clerk.  \"Oh,\r\n\r\nno,  not  really!  He  does not  have  two  sets  of\r\n\r\naccounts!\" And this, Sir, actually came back through\r\n\r\nthe  clerk,  \"I have three sets - one for myself;  one\r\n\r\nfor   my  partner;  and  one  for  the  Income   Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment!\" That did occur!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very large-scale evasions are taking place.\r\n\r\nGovernment is at the present moment considering  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  publication,  by  authority  of   this\r\n\r\nAssembly, of the names and the income totals of  all\r\n\r\nthe  income  taxpayers in the hope that the  general\r\n\r\npublic,  reading that book, would be able to  assist\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Department in pointing out the under-declarations   therein  indicated.   You   will   be\r\n\r\nsurprised to learn, Sir, that there are,  out  of  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  1,200,000  people  in  Singapore,  20,000\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  and a large proportion are  the  salaried\r\n\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask that the measures which Government\r\n\r\nrequests  of  this House be accorded it  for  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  in order to see to what extent we can succeed\r\n\r\nin  stemming  large-scale  evasions.  It  is  hardly\r\n\r\nprobable  that there will be any abuse of the  small\r\n\r\nman.  I  do not deny that there is a possibility  of\r\n\r\nthe   eventualities  indicated  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon.  The possibility does exist, Sir,  but  I\r\n\r\nsay  that it is hardly probable that the Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment,  which has been called upon  to  tighten\r\n\r\nits  procedure and its methods in collecting  moneys\r\n\r\ndue  to  Government, would waste time with the  very\r\n\r\nsmall trader. I say let us have these measures which\r\n\r\nwe seek of you, and if in the course of the next two\r\n\r\nor three years there are indications of abuse, then,\r\n\r\nby  all means, on evidence thereof, limit them.  But\r\n\r\nif  you ask us to limit now to 1947 - although frankly\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  the proviso is a little  too  vaguely\r\n\r\nworded  to carry out that intention - but if  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  intention,  then you are really  preventing  us\r\n\r\nfrom asking a person, whose guilt is, say, evidenced\r\n\r\nin  transactions  in 1953, to produce  his  accounts\r\n\r\nwhich  we  should  like  to trace  as  far  back  as\r\n\r\npossible.   You   are   quite  unnecessarily   there\r\n\r\nassisting  those who shamelessly refuse to  carry  a\r\n\r\nvery  moderate burden in respect of the  maintenance\r\n\r\nof  the  services of this country. I say, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe  time may well come when the limitations  sought\r\n\r\nby  the hon. Member would be justified, but the time\r\n\r\nis not now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I think there is some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding   about   the   purpose   of   this\r\n\r\namendment.  It  has  been stated, entirely  rightly,\r\n\r\nthat  under  Section  69 of the present  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance there is provision that where there is any\r\n\r\nform of fraud or wilful default, the Comptroller may\r\n\r\nassess  such  person at any time, and therefore  the\r\n\r\namendment  does  not arise in the  case  of  such  a\r\n\r\nperson.  The Government has already had the  powers,\r\n\r\nand  why,  therefore,  is the  Government  concerned\r\n\r\nregarding this amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause 7, as it stands, enables the\r\n\r\nComptroller  to  require  particulars   of   banking\r\n\r\naccounts, etc. from any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperson, not necessarily  fraudulent persons back  to\r\n\r\n1947, which  means, in effect, that  such  accounts\r\n\r\nmust  be  kept  indefinitely by everyone  liable  to\r\n\r\nincome  tax, whether now or in the future, on  the\r\n\r\noff  chance that they may be called upon. It may not\r\n\r\nbe intended, but this is what it states. The purpose\r\n\r\nof  the amendment is quite clear, Sir. Whereas under\r\n\r\nSection 69 of the main Ordinance the Comptroller may\r\n\r\nonly make additional assessment for a back period of\r\n\r\nsix  years, so should he only be permitted  to  call\r\n\r\nfor details of accounts, if necessary, for a similar\r\n\r\nperiod. It is logical. It is reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very well for the Hon. the Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary to assure us that the honest man cannot be\r\n\r\naffected. The innocent have suffered with the guilty\r\n\r\nbefore  now,  and the former deserve the  protection\r\n\r\nwhich  this  amendment  will  afford  them  in  some\r\n\r\nmeasure. The latter, under Section 69, in any  case,\r\n\r\nwill  not  escape,  and we do  not  desire  them  to\r\n\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr C. H.

That section does not\r\n\r\ngive  him  the  powers which the  new  section  will\r\n\r\nconfer upon him. It does not give  him the powers to\r\n\r\ndemand  the  production of accounts, a  statement  of\r\n\r\nassets and so on.

The\r\n\r\nCommission   was  set  up  in   Kuala   Lumpur   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate claims for compensation for war damage,\r\n\r\nand  to  make  payments from the Fund in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith the principles laid down in the law. This work\r\n\r\nhas   continued  steadily  since  1950.

The various clauses  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  will  come  into force  on  dates  to  be\r\n\r\ndetermined by His Excellency the Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides a bar to legal proceedings in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  any claims or awards or  in  connection\r\n\r\nwith the winding up of the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, which deals with the application of the\r\n\r\nFund  and   the  transfer of its  assets,  provides\r\n\r\nthat, in the event of any award being in dispute  at\r\n\r\nthe  date of the commencement of the Ordinance,  the\r\n\r\nCommission may pay the award into Court, or make any\r\n\r\nother provision for payment as it thinks fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides for the ultimate disposal of the\r\n\r\nFund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 prescribes that the accounts of the\r\n\r\nCommission  shall  be audited as  soon  as  possible\r\n\r\nafter  the  application of the Fund. A copy  of  the\r\n\r\naccounts and of the Director of Audit's Report will\r\n\r\nsubsequently be tabled in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides for the disposal of the\r\n\r\ndocuments  of  the  Commission   and  against  legal\r\n\r\nproceedings  arising  from  the  disposal  of  these\r\n\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 provides for the abolition of the\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 provides against proceedings directed\r\n\r\nagainst  Government, the Commission, and any officer\r\n\r\nof these bodies  in respect of war damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 indemnifies Government or any officer of\r\n\r\nthe,  Government against any act done in good faith\r\n\r\nafter the first of January, 1950.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 seeks to amend subsection (1) of Section\r\n\r\n10  of  the War Damage Ordinance. Paragraph (a)  has\r\n\r\nnever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen put into effect, and it is not intended to pay\r\n\r\nthe expenses of the previous War Damage Claims\r\n\r\nCommission out of  the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clause 12, Section 11 (1) of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  confers an absolute right of  payment  in\r\n\r\ncertain cases and, before commencing the winding  up\r\n\r\nof  the  War Damage Fund, it is necessary to  repeal\r\n\r\nthis  subsection.  There are  no  outstanding  cases\r\n\r\ncovered  by  the  subsection which  clause  12  (1)\r\n\r\naccordingly  seeks to repeal. The remainder  of  the\r\n\r\nWar  Damage  Ordinance  will be  repealed  when  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of clauses 8, 9 and 10 of the  Bill  are\r\n\r\nbrought into force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill are straightforward and\r\n\r\nwill,  I  think,  be generally acceptable  to  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers. A similar Bill is being introduced  at  the\r\n\r\nnext meeting of the Federal Legislative Council.  It\r\n\r\nis  hoped  that  the  Fund will  be  wound  up,  the\r\n\r\naccounts  and the Report tabled, and the  Commission\r\n\r\nabolished by June of this year.

If I am to understand that  this\r\n\r\nis  taken to mean the Council of Ministers,  then  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  objection; but if that is not  so,  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter  that the appointments should be made by  the\r\n\r\nCouncil of Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I think it may be that the hon.\r\n\r\nMember moving this amendment has overlooked the fact\r\n\r\nthat  this Committee of Appeal is formed by quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber of authorities. Under Section\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21 (1) (a) of the Cinematograph Films Ordinance, the\r\n\r\nfirst  authority  is that there  are  three  persons\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Governor, and under paragraph  (b)\r\n\r\nthere are three persons appointed by the Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil. Now, it is (b) which the present Bill seeks\r\n\r\nto  change, so that if the Bill, as now worded,  was\r\n\r\naccepted  by  the  Assembly, we  should  have  three\r\n\r\npersons  appointed by the Governor and three persons\r\n\r\nappointed by the Minister. I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member moving the amendment would like to give\r\n\r\nfurther  thought to it. I do not think it  would  be\r\n\r\nsatisfactory drafting to suggest that three  members\r\n\r\nshould  be  appointed by the Council  of  Ministers,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think  I  am right in  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  position is that it  should  be  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  in Council - which is, in fact, the  Council\r\n\r\nof  Ministers - so that his amendment would therefore,\r\n\r\nI  think,  give  us three persons appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor and three persons appointed by the Governor\r\n\r\nin  Council. There are obviously slight anomalies in\r\n\r\nhaving  those  two  in  such  close  association.  I\r\n\r\nshould,  however, like to make it quite clear,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  from the Government side of the House, we have\r\n\r\nno  objection in principle to accepting an amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  will  give  this power  to  the  Governor  in\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  not  to  the  Minister.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nobjection  in  principle at  all.  It  is  merely  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of neatness of wording.

R. Dasaratha Raj, who\r\n\r\nwas  responsible for the introduction of  the  Hindu\r\n\r\nMonogamous Marriage Bill in 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of Hindu marriages and its legal\r\n\r\nrecognition  is not my own idea. Nor  is  it  a  new\r\n\r\nthing  in  Singapore. I do not, for a  moment,  Sir,\r\n\r\nlike  to  take credit for the work which I am  doing\r\n\r\ntoday  in this Assembly. In the previous Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil in 1954, my friend, Mr C. R. Dasaratha Raj,\r\n\r\nintroduced  a Hindu Monogamous Marriage  Bill.  This\r\n\r\nBill,  which came up for its Second Reading in April\r\n\r\n1954, was referred to a Select Committee as some  of\r\n\r\nthe provisions were controversial. I was a Member of\r\n\r\nthis Select Committee and we discussed the matter at\r\n\r\nconsiderable  length,  but it was  unfortunate  that\r\n\r\nthis  Committee was unable to make a Report  to  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Council as it was prorogued prior to the\r\n\r\nGeneral Elections in April\r\n\r\n1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, members of the Hindu community find things\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult  when  disputes  arise  between\r\n\r\nhusband and wife, in particular, disputes in respect\r\n\r\nof maintenance for the wife and inheritance, because\r\n\r\nthe  Courts  of the Colony are reluctant  to  accept\r\n\r\nHindu  marriages  as  valid for  want  of  proof  of\r\n\r\nmarriage. At present. Sir, Hindu marriages performed\r\n\r\nin  the Colony are not required to be registered. It\r\n\r\nis  also  difficult, Sir, to prove  Hindu  marriages\r\n\r\nperformed  outside the Colony. Since 1933  or  1934,\r\n\r\nSir,  several  pleas have been  made  by  the  Hindu\r\n\r\ncommunity in Singapore to the proper authority.  The\r\n\r\nHindu  Advisory  Board also have taken  considerable\r\n\r\ntime  in  expounding this cause and I am  glad  that\r\n\r\nthey have taken up the matter very vigorously at all\r\n\r\nstages.  Hinduism being a religion, members  of  the\r\n\r\nHindu   community  would  prefer  to  have  separate\r\n\r\nlegislation to validate marriages between\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHindus, and matters incidental thereto, just  as  we\r\n\r\nhave the Muslim Marriage Ordinance and the Christian\r\n\r\nMarriage   Ordinance  for  Muslims  and   Christians\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second part of my motion, which requests\r\n\r\nGovernment  to introduce the necessary  legislation,\r\n\r\nis  designed  to  enable the  Bill  to  be  as  non-controversial as possible. At present, I  understand\r\n\r\nthere  are  differences of opinion among  Hindus  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as to the question of certain  provisions\r\n\r\nin  the Hindu Monogamous Marriage Bill. A section of\r\n\r\nthe  Hindu community contends that there is no  need\r\n\r\nfor  the provision of divorce in the Marriage  Bill,\r\n\r\nwhile another section contends that since Hindus are\r\n\r\nmonogamous, there should be provision for divorce in\r\n\r\nthe  Marriage  Bill. That section of  the  community\r\n\r\nwhich  wants  divorce provisions in the Bill  argues\r\n\r\nthat  Government employees who are  members  of  the\r\n\r\nHindu  community  are unable to  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nWidows'   and Orphans'  Fund. There seem to  be  these\r\n\r\ndifferences,  Sir,  and  I  feel  that,  instead  of\r\n\r\nattempting to introduce a Marriage Bill which  again\r\n\r\nwould  be very controversial in nature, I had better\r\n\r\nleave   the  whole  matter  in  the  hands  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  which can iron out the differences  with\r\n\r\nthe  aid  of public opinion in Singapore.  There  is\r\n\r\nalso a section of Hindus in Singapore, Sir, who feel\r\n\r\nthat  marriages should be performed  in  a  reformed\r\n\r\nstyle,  but I feel, Sir, that both the old style  of\r\n\r\nmarriages   and   the  reformed  style   should   be\r\n\r\nrecognised in any Marriage Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why I want the Government to go\r\n\r\ninto  this matter has already been mentioned  by  me\r\n\r\nearlier.  I would suggest, Sir, that the Government,\r\n\r\nif  my  motion is accepted, call a meeting  of   all\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  Hindu  organisations  and  then\r\n\r\nappoint  a working party, with the aid of the  Hindu\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Board, of course, to go into this question\r\n\r\nvery thoroughly, so that whatever little differences\r\n\r\nthey have amongst themselves can be ironed out and a\r\n\r\nBill  which  is  acceptable to  all  Hindus  can  be\r\n\r\nintroduced into this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my motion, as it stands today, is absolutely\r\n\r\nnon-political  in  character and  I  am  placing  it\r\n\r\nbefore the Assembly in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  hope  that Members will rise above their  Party\r\n\r\nlevel and give it the support that it deserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take this opportunity, Sir, of thanking\r\n\r\nthe Hindu Sabhai, the Malayan Tamil Associations  in\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur and Singapore, the Dravagalagam, Mr G.\r\n\r\nSarangapany   (the  representative  of   the   Tamil\r\n\r\nRepresentative Council) and Mr C.

As the mover of the  motion\r\n\r\nhas said, owing to the General Elections, the Report\r\n\r\nof  the  Select Committee was not submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil.  I do not know why this was so.

I have always maintained  that\r\n\r\nreligion  should not come within the four  walls  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly and should not prejudice  us  in  any\r\n\r\ndecision where religion is concerned. I do not  like\r\n\r\nto  discuss the merits or demerits of the motion, as\r\n\r\nit  only  calls  upon Government to  introduce  such\r\n\r\nlegislation as early as possible, but I  would  like\r\n\r\nto  congratulate the Member for Seletar, who is  the\r\n\r\nonly   Hindu  Member  in  this  Assembly   who   has\r\n\r\ninitiative to move the introduction of such a motion\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly  in the social interests  of  the\r\n\r\nHindus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own Division, at least about 30 per cent of\r\n\r\nmy  electorate are Hindus, and when this motion came\r\n\r\ninto my hands after being circulated, I consulted  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of them and they told me that this Bill  had\r\n\r\nbeen   far,   far  delayed.

I  think,\r\n\r\nhowever, that it is only right that I should sound a\r\n\r\nnote of caution on the difficulties that face us  in\r\n\r\nconsidering  the  motion.  I  was  hoping  that,  in\r\n\r\nspeaking  to it, we should get a clear lead  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  is  required, because, with all  respect,  the\r\n\r\nwording  of the motion leaves the issues very  broad\r\n\r\nand very indefinite. We are asked to provide for the\r\n\r\ncompulsory  registration  of  Hindu  marriages  \"and\r\n\r\nother  matters  connected  therewith\",  and  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is to legislate on a matter which is  one\r\n\r\nof   considerable  religious  controversy,   it   is\r\n\r\nimportant  that we should have a clear lead  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  is meant by the \"other matters connected  with\r\n\r\nHindu marriages\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar, in moving his motion,\r\n\r\nreferred  to the desire to have marriages registered\r\n\r\nand   he  referred  to  the  desire  to  have  Hindu\r\n\r\nmarriages made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonogamous.  Now, he did not make  it  clear  to  me\r\n\r\nwhether he was speaking as a member of that religion\r\n\r\nwho  thought  it right that, by statute,  we  should\r\n\r\ncompel  Hindus to be monogamous. That is one of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  important  questions  that  have  got  to  be\r\n\r\ndecided   before   we  can  proceed   to   introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have referred to the fate of a\r\n\r\nprevious attempt to introduce legislation concerning\r\n\r\nHindu marriages, and it has been suggested that  the\r\n\r\nBill  introduced in the previous Legislative Council\r\n\r\nwas unfortunately brought to nought by the expiry of\r\n\r\nthe  time of that Council. As another Member put  it\r\n\r\nrather more colourfully, it was brought to nought by\r\n\r\nreason of the elections - a somewhat strange cause.\r\n\r\nBut, in fact, a contributory cause to the failure to\r\n\r\nget  that Bill on the statute book was that  it  did\r\n\r\narouse  very acute controversy amongst those persons\r\n\r\nwho   profess  the  Hindu  religion,  and   my   own\r\n\r\nimpression of it is that if we are not careful,  the\r\n\r\nsame  fate will befall any new legislation which  we\r\n\r\nmay  introduce. We must try to ensure that  it  does\r\n\r\nnot  founder on acute religious controversy  amongst\r\n\r\nthe very people whom we are trying to help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the present position to be that a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Hindus,  including  the  Hindu  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard, do want legislation to be introduced to  make\r\n\r\nthe  registration of Hindu marriages compulsory;  to\r\n\r\nlegislate that Hindu marriages should be monogamous;\r\n\r\nto make provision for divorce; and to make provision\r\n\r\nfor  the  ages at which Hindus shall be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nmarry.  From the representations we received on  the\r\n\r\nprevious  occasion,  there are  a  number  of  other\r\n\r\norganisations in the Hindu community  some  of  whom\r\n\r\nsupport  some  of  those points  and  some  of  whom\r\n\r\nsupport  only  one; but there is, in particular,  an\r\n\r\norganisation known as the Tamils Reform Association,\r\n\r\nand  that  Association has on two occasions produced\r\n\r\nan  alternative  draft Bill with  the  request  that\r\n\r\ntheir draft Bill, which they claim is a simple Bill,\r\n\r\nshould  be introduced without any further  delay  to\r\n\r\nsettle   the  other  very  much  more  controversial\r\n\r\nissues. In their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndraft Bill, they merely ask that the registration of\r\n\r\nHindu  marriages  should  be  compulsory  and   they\r\n\r\nsuggest  that,  if legislation is provided  to  make\r\n\r\nregistration   compulsory,  that  could   meet   the\r\n\r\ngreatest and the common need of the Hindu community.\r\n\r\nThey  are against embarking on further controversial\r\n\r\nmatters such as provisions for monogamy, for divorce\r\n\r\nand  other connected matters. When those views  were\r\n\r\nproduced   two  years  ago - I  think  it   is   about\r\n\r\nthat - there was very considerable criticism by  other\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Hindu community who said  that  the\r\n\r\nTamils  Reform Association was really an Association\r\n\r\nof  Tamils and not an Association of Hindus, and  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  representative of Hindu  opinion.  Whether\r\n\r\nthat is a valid criticism or not, I am sure I do not\r\n\r\nknow,  but the point I do want to emphasise is  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  matter which has, in the  past,  roused\r\n\r\ngreat  public controversy between persons professing\r\n\r\nthe  Hindu religion, and unless we can get some lead\r\n\r\nwhich  appears to be unanimous or nearly  unanimous,\r\n\r\nit  is  going  to  be  extremely difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  with  the best will in  the  world,  to\r\n\r\ndraft  legislation which will be acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, I think, suggested that there was no way at\r\n\r\nthe present moment in which a Hindu marriage can  be\r\n\r\nregistered.  It is true that there is  no  provision\r\n\r\nfor registering Hindu marriages as such, but I think\r\n\r\nit  is  possible  for Hindus who marry  to  register\r\n\r\ntheir  marriages under the Civil Marriage Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThat,  I know, is not what is asked for but it  does\r\n\r\nprovide some facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make it clear, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has,  as  I think  I  have  said,  great\r\n\r\nsympathy  with this request on behalf of  the  Hindu\r\n\r\ncommunity for legislation to enable their affairs of\r\n\r\nmarriage to be more satisfactorily regulated, and  I\r\n\r\nam  quite  prepared to give an undertaking  that  we\r\n\r\nwill give facilities for legislation; but I think  I\r\n\r\nmust  say that before we can make any real progress,\r\n\r\nit will be necessary for the leading members and the\r\n\r\nleading organisations of the Hindu community to  try\r\n\r\nto reach some measure of agreement on precisely what\r\n\r\nlegislation  would  be acceptable  to  them  at  the\r\n\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided  that the Hindus can make it  clear  to  us\r\n\r\nwhat they want and we can have a reasonable prospect\r\n\r\nof  drafting and introducing legislation which  will\r\n\r\nnot  provoke intense religious controversy,  then  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  you that the Government  will  be  very\r\n\r\nready to examine this question in consultation  with\r\n\r\nHindu public opinion. But we do not wish - and I think\r\n\r\nthe House will agree that it would be ill-advised - in\r\n\r\ntrying  to help the Hindu community to get ourselves\r\n\r\ninvolved in perhaps a bitter religious controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  not a Hindu but I am interested in this problem,\r\n\r\nand  it  seems to me rather amusing that a  bachelor\r\n\r\nlike  the Member for Seletar should be so interested\r\n\r\nin  the question of marriage and divorce. Whether he\r\n\r\nis contemplating marriage in the near future or not,\r\n\r\nhe  has  not informed us. Whether there  is  a  girl\r\n\r\nbehind  the  throne  who  wants  to  compel  him  to\r\n\r\nregister  their impending marriage, he has also  not\r\n\r\ninformed  us.  But  I never like  to  make  anything\r\n\r\ncompulsory.  If  registration of marriages  for  the\r\n\r\nHindus or for any other race is necessary, it should\r\n\r\nbe  voluntary  and not compulsory. The  Hindus  have\r\n\r\ncustoms  as  old as the Chinese or other communities\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, and they may like to stick  to  their\r\n\r\ncustoms  and  not want to register their  marriages.\r\n\r\nSo, on the question of compulsory registration, I am\r\n\r\nnot in favour of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is with\r\n\r\nconsiderable  hesitation that I  voice  my  Party's\r\n\r\nopinion  on this motion. One of the reasons why  the\r\n\r\nBritish  has survived for so long in their  colonies\r\n\r\nis   because  they  never  tamper  with  deep-seated\r\n\r\nloyalties  and prejudices, loyalties to a particular\r\n\r\nreligion,  a  particular mode of life, a  particular\r\n\r\nmode   of   conduct.  This  policy  of  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment, which has worked so successfully in  the\r\n\r\npast,  has led us into curious situations. We  have,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  in Singapore today polygamy  legally\r\n\r\nrecognised  because, at the time  when  the  British\r\n\r\nfirst came here, the people who then lived here  had\r\n\r\npolygamous institutions brought from the country  of\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norigin.  Time has marched on in India and in  China,\r\n\r\nbut  time  has stayed still in British Malaya.  This\r\n\r\nhas  created urgent social problems. Today a Chinese\r\n\r\ncan have ten wives and fifteen concubines in Malaya,\r\n\r\nbut  if  he  were to go back to China, he  would  be\r\n\r\npromptly put into gaol and his wives freed to  marry\r\n\r\nothers who can more satisfactorily look after  their\r\n\r\nwelfare. So it is that the Hindus in Singapore  have\r\n\r\nbeen  allowed to carry on their religious  practices\r\n\r\nwithout any let or hindrance from the Government. So\r\n\r\nlong  as the practice did not hamper the development\r\n\r\nof   rubber  and  tin  and  such  other  useful  and\r\n\r\nprofitable   pursuits,  there  was  no  reason - quite\r\n\r\nrightly,  the British thought - to interfere with  all\r\n\r\nthese human activities. But I am sure time must have\r\n\r\nmoved  on  in  India, and a great deal of  what  the\r\n\r\nIndians   consider   to  be   the   less   desirable\r\n\r\ncharacteristics of Hinduism, like a  widow  flinging\r\n\r\nherself  on  her husband's funeral pyre,  have  been\r\n\r\ncompletely  abolished  in  India.  But  I  think  in\r\n\r\nSingapore - in law anyway - there is nothing to  prevent\r\n\r\na  widow from having a funeral pyre, upon which  she\r\n\r\ncan  immolate herself. So it is that the Member  for\r\n\r\nSeletar  is concerned with the unsatisfactory  state\r\n\r\nof the law relating to Hindus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not versed in Hindu law. It is one of\r\n\r\nthose subjects which I thought too erudite, and I am\r\n\r\nstill in a state of comfortable vagueness about  the\r\n\r\ncustoms of the Hindus. But I do appreciate, from the\r\n\r\npoints  made by the Member for Seletar and supported\r\n\r\nby  the  Muslim Member for Telok Ayer, that  certain\r\n\r\nchanges  have become necessary. But it seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat the policy of separate legislation for separate\r\n\r\nreligions  may raise difficulties. I am  not  saying\r\n\r\nthat  it  is wrong. I am not saying that  we  should\r\n\r\noppose  it.  But we must consider the problem  which\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of legislation would create  for  us  if\r\n\r\nevery   religious   group - Taoists,   Buddhists   and\r\n\r\nConfucians - were  to come before  this  Assembly  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"We believe in cutting a cockerel's neck  when\r\n\r\nwe  take  our  oath in the witness  box.

One of the planks of several of the  women's  sections of political parties represented in this\r\n\r\nAssembly  is the institution of monogamy.  Even  the\r\n\r\nMalay community - I do not know if it is Kaum Ibu, but\r\n\r\nit is some Malay women's organisation - have advocated\r\n\r\nthat  polygamy  be  abolished and  that  the  Malays\r\n\r\nshould  practise monogamy. There has  been  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of male resistance to this suggestion and  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is still unresolved. But for large  sections\r\n\r\nof  the  population, particularly the  Chinese,  the\r\n\r\nposition is thoroughly unsatisfactory and completely\r\n\r\nreprehensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, one has in Singapore the curious spectacle\r\n\r\nof  the  English law of intestacy of the  eighteenth\r\n\r\ncentury  embellished  and  embroidered  to  fit  the\r\n\r\npolygamous  institutions of China of the  eighteenth\r\n\r\ncentury. When a man dies leaving ten wives  and  ten\r\n\r\nchildren, those ten wives can all go to Court to get\r\n\r\nprobate in order that they can share what in English\r\n\r\nlaw  has  been set aside for the widow - one-third  to\r\n\r\nthe widow, two-thirds to the children. The Courts in\r\n\r\nthis  Colony  administering English law  in  such  a\r\n\r\ncurious  position have said, \"One-third to  all  the\r\n\r\nwidows, and two-thirds to all the children.\" This is\r\n\r\na  matter which should receive comprehensive review.\r\n\r\nNo  single political Party could brave the storm  of\r\n\r\nreligious protest and resistance, but if we  made  a\r\n\r\nserious  attempt  to  reconcile religious  practices\r\n\r\nwith  modern-day  needs in a  modern-day  world,  we\r\n\r\nmight  then first decide whether special legislation\r\n\r\nfor  each religion is the answer, or whether omnibus\r\n\r\nlegislation  covering  all  religions,  except   the\r\n\r\nMuslim  religion  which  is  an  almost  established\r\n\r\nchurch in the Federation, might not be a better\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanswer than the proposal of the Member for Seletar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here, Sir, an amendment to move to this\r\n\r\nmotion  which  I  understand is  acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\nmover, namely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this Assembly is of the opinion that a\r\n\r\nCommittee   be   appointed  by  the  Government   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  the  need for and  advisability  of  an\r\n\r\nOrdinance to provide for the compulsory registration\r\n\r\nof  Hindu  marriages in Singapore and other  matters\r\n\r\nconnected  therewith in accordance  with  the  Hindu\r\n\r\nReligion, customs and manners acceptable to all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The rest of the paragraph is left out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

The  original motion put forward  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Seletar  expressed  the  opinion   that\r\n\r\nlegislation  is  desirable,  whereas  we   are   now\r\n\r\nproposing to set up a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee to discover whether or not legislation  is\r\n\r\nadvisable. I am not saying that it is not  a  better\r\n\r\nway  of approaching the problem, but it seems to  me\r\n\r\nto be fundamentally different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I should like to put forward\r\n\r\nfor the consideration of the House is that there  is\r\n\r\nin  existence today, and it has been for many years,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  known  as the Hindu Advisory  Board.  That\r\n\r\nBoard  consists  of  a  number  of  Hindus  who  are\r\n\r\nappointed  for the express purpose of  advising  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  precisely  such  matters  as   this,\r\n\r\nnamely,   matters   affecting  Hindu   customs   and\r\n\r\nreligion. It would appear, at first sight, though it\r\n\r\nmay  not  be the intention of the Assembly, that  by\r\n\r\nappointing  a Committee we indicate that  the  Hindu\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Board  is not the most  suitable  body  to\r\n\r\nadvise us on this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I am really at a loss to know what\r\n\r\nis  in  the mind of the Government. Originally,  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Chief  Secretary stated  that  the  Hindu\r\n\r\nAdvisory Board has made certain recommendations  and\r\n\r\nthe Tamils Reform Association are against them. That\r\n\r\nwould mean substantially that the recommendation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Hindu Advisory Board is not really the view  of\r\n\r\nHindu  public  opinion  in  Singapore.  I  find   it\r\n\r\ndifficult to reconcile the two arguments, and  I  am\r\n\r\ninclined  to  accept the amendment because  of  this\r\n\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I had made a good case for my original\r\n\r\nmotion when I had explained the whole circumstances,\r\n\r\nand  it  would  appear that, because differences  of\r\n\r\npublic opinion among Hindus exist in Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  do  very little  in  the  way  of\r\n\r\npromoting  legislation. Now, I think the  suggestion\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  mover of the amendment clearly  shows\r\n\r\nthat  if  there  are  such differences  and  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot tackle them,  then  it  would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  to appoint a Committee to find  out  what\r\n\r\npublic  opinion is in regard to Hindu  marriages.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  the  Government must accept the situation  one\r\n\r\nway  or  the  other, and I can only  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nalternative suggestion put before the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse, would be accepted by Government,  otherwise\r\n\r\nthey would have accepted my original motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

It seeks at  all   times  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  legitimate requirements of the people  of\r\n\r\nthe  country.  There is no question  but   that  the\r\n\r\nHindu  population,  as I understand it, desire  some\r\n\r\nsort  of legislation but the unfortunate part  about\r\n\r\nthis  motion, and one that has taken us by surprise,\r\n\r\nis  that  it  seems  to  have been  so  inadequately\r\n\r\nprepared.  It is true that legislation is  required,\r\n\r\nbut  the  hon. Member who has proposed it  does  not\r\n\r\nseem to have delved sufficiently into the background\r\n\r\nto  enquire into the possibility that there could be\r\n\r\nany  question of unanimity on the part of the  Hindu\r\n\r\npopulation in respect of the matter which  he  seeks\r\n\r\nto  raise.  Sir, we could introduce  the  Bill,  and\r\n\r\nfairly  soon,  for  the compulsory  registration  of\r\n\r\nHindu     marriages   which   might   find   general\r\n\r\nacceptance,  but the other issues which many  Hindus\r\n\r\nfeel  should  be  tackled  at  the  same  time   are\r\n\r\nextremely difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Hindu Advisory Board has been referred to,\r\n\r\nand so that there should be no misunderstanding that\r\n\r\nit is this Board that the hon.

We  will appoint this  Committee  with\r\n\r\npleasure. We can but hope that it will produce  some\r\n\r\ndegree of unanimity.

But  from  what  I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Sir, it is going to  be  a  matter  for\r\n\r\nprominent members of the Hindu community to try  to\r\n\r\nsink  their  differences if there  is  going  to  be\r\n\r\nanything worth  while produced by Government by  way\r\n\r\nof an Ordinance following on this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Secretary, in replying to the original motion,\r\n\r\nsaid that the last attempt at legislation could  not\r\n\r\nbe   brought  into  being  because  of  the  various\r\n\r\ndifferences  of opinion existing amongst  the  Hindu\r\n\r\ncommunity  and their various bodies. This  amendment\r\n\r\nhas  solved  his  troubles.  The  Government  should\r\n\r\nappoint  a Committee and all these bodies will  come\r\n\r\nbefore the Committee and present their views.  Where\r\n\r\nthey  are  unanimous  on, say, the  registration  of\r\n\r\nmarriages, that may be accepted. Other things,  like\r\n\r\nthe age of the marriage or the divorce, can also  be\r\n\r\ntackled by that Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I can understand, the difficulty really\r\n\r\nis  this - that a married couple require a certificate\r\n\r\nto prove that they were legally married. This is the\r\n\r\nactual trouble that is going on in Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation.  This is actually what is required,  and\r\n\r\nif  the  points  that  these people  give  in  their\r\n\r\nevidence  are unanimous, then the Government  should\r\n\r\nat  least help them by bringing in such legislation.\r\n\r\nI think this amendment solves the question by having\r\n\r\na Committee appointed and this Committee can examine\r\n\r\nall these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> We had the Committee before.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak with\r\n\r\ngreat timidity on this sort of subject because I am\r\n\r\na  religious man myself, and I should hate to  have\r\n\r\nmy  religion  interfered with;  but I feel  that  we\r\n\r\nare  hopefully   looking forward  to  an  increasing\r\n\r\nnational   unity  which  tends  to   mean   national\r\n\r\nuniformity  in behaviour and standards and so  on - that people more  or  less  behave in the same  kind\r\n\r\nof way, which is the Malayan way, and not any other\r\n\r\nkind  of way. But the way  to achieve that sort  of\r\n\r\nnational  unity and national  uniformity is  not  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  get  large-scale  legislation  which  makes\r\n\r\nmassive   changes   rather  rapidly.    That    does\r\n\r\npossibly seem to be implied in this motion. I am not\r\n\r\nsure.  The \"other matters\" are unspecified and  they\r\n\r\nmight  merely be whether you register your children\r\n\r\nas  well or whether you do not do not know what  the\r\n\r\n\"other matters\" might be, but it obviously could  be\r\n\r\nvery  far-reaching  in matters  connected  with  the\r\n\r\nHindu religion particularly almost anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sort of thing that seems to me to be desirable\r\n\r\nis  that we should accept for practical purposes the\r\n\r\nfact  that,  here and there, everybody  accepts  the\r\n\r\nsame law. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary can\r\n\r\ncorrect me if I am wrong, but I think that no matter\r\n\r\nwhat  your  religion is, as far as  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance  goes, you are only allowed one wife.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I do not know whether I am correct or  not,\r\n\r\nbut that is my understanding of it. That seems to be\r\n\r\nthe  way  in  which we should go to work to  produce\r\n\r\nnational uniformity. [Interruption.] If you have  not\r\n\r\ngot a wife, you cannot claim for her as well!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You need a certificate too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> That seems to me the way in which we\r\n\r\nshould go to work.

There  is\r\n\r\nsure  to be some influential society or group  which\r\n\r\nsays, \"No, we think the opposite.\" It is always like\r\n\r\nthat   in  human  affairs,  whether  it  is  Hindus,\r\n\r\nBritish,  or  anybody else, and I  prefer  the  much\r\n\r\nsimpler  motion  \"to study the needs and  wishes  of\r\n\r\nthe  Hindu  community with regard to Hindu marriages\r\n\r\nand  to make recommendations\" which would leave  you\r\n\r\nwithout these rather restrictive clauses about being\r\n\r\nin  accordance with the Hindu religion, customs  and\r\n\r\nmanners acceptable to all Hindus. But I will save\r\n\r\ntime and assume that this will be read in a generous\r\n\r\nlight by the Committee and I will not move a further\r\n\r\namendment to this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nregarding  this question, I think it is better   for\r\n\r\nme,  in  supporting this amendment, not to  add  any\r\n\r\nword,  because, as I understand, this amendment  has\r\n\r\nbeen  actually  brought  up  by   two  of  the  most\r\n\r\nbrilliant Members in the Assembly. I would, however,\r\n\r\nlike   to  point  out  that  the  Government  should\r\n\r\nrecognise  and  admit that such a  Bill  is  already\r\n\r\noverdue and that immediate action should be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the words proposed to be left out\r\n\r\nin  the  original  motion, be left  out,\"  put,  and\r\n\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The words are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"a Committee be appointed by the Government to\r\n\r\ninvestigate   the  advisability   of   enacting   an\r\n\r\nOrdinance to provide for the compulsory registration\r\n\r\nof  Hindu  marriages in Singapore and other  matters\r\n\r\nconnected  therewith in accordance  with  the  Hindu\r\n\r\nReligion,  customs  and manners  acceptable  to  all\r\n\r\nHindus and to make the necessary recommendations  to\r\n\r\nthe Government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to take the\r\n\r\nopportunity of elucidating a phrase which is  in  my\r\n\r\nmotion,   and  that  is,  \"other  matters  connected\r\n\r\ntherewith  in  accordance with the  Hindu  Religion,\r\n\r\ncustoms and manners acceptable to all Hindus\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this motion has been so worded is to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  both sides. If I had only said \"registration\r\n\r\nof  marriages\" and then stopped there,  we  would  be\r\n\r\ngetting a lot of representations from people who also\r\n\r\nwanted some other religious matters incorporated into\r\n\r\nthe  Marriage Bill. So I thought that, side  by  side\r\n\r\nwith having registration of Hindu Marriages, it would\r\n\r\nbe  advisable  for the Government to  consider  other\r\n\r\naspects  connected with Hindu marriages and religion.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   I   added   \"other   matters   connected\r\n\r\ntherewith\". When I said \"therewith\", it does not mean\r\n\r\nHinduism and its law in all aspects, but I only  said\r\n\r\n\"connected  therewith\". That means  only  Hindu  laws\r\n\r\naffecting marriages. So you appreciate, Sir, that the\r\n\r\nquestion   which   the   Hon. the   Minister    for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and  Works has raised  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nHindu  law does not arise. It only affects marriages.\r\n\r\nIn  Hindu  law,  there are only certain  cases  which\r\n\r\naffect  religion,  just  like the  sacred  ceremonies\r\n\r\nwhich  are  held.  One  side says,  \"We  want  sacred\r\n\r\nceremonies to be held.\" Another side says, \"No, we do\r\n\r\nnot  want  any  sacred ceremonies. Just  call  a  few\r\n\r\npeople  and have a feast and then that is the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  marriage.\" That is the main reason, Sir,  why  I\r\n\r\ninserted this particular phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that everybody is agreed on this motion, I do\r\n\r\nnot  wish to say too much on this except to leave the\r\n\r\nwhole matter in the hands of the Committee which will\r\n\r\nconsider the other relevant matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the words proposed to be inserted,\r\n\r\nbe there inserted,\" put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I am certain that the\r\n\r\nRt.  Hon.  Mr  Alan  Lennox-Boyd is  not  altogether\r\n\r\nignorant  of the powerful, if sometimes inarticulate,\r\n\r\ndesire   of   the  people  to  be  rid  of   colonial\r\n\r\ndomination.  However,  a  delegation  is  shortly  to\r\n\r\narrive in Singapore and I hope that we shall all take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the opportunity to bring home to the six\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament the urgency of the problem  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It may be true that both the Labour  Party\r\n\r\nleader of the delegation and the Conservative Party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleader  of  the delegation - the Rt. Hon. Mr  Herbert\r\n\r\nMorrison, P.C., M.P., and the Rt. Hon. Mr  Geoffrey\r\n\r\nLloyd, P.C., M.P. - are persons who have perhaps known\r\n\r\nbetter  political times in their careers, but  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  they  are not altogether without influence  in\r\n\r\ntheir  Parties and we may be able, through them,  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  the  policy  of  their  Parties   towards\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what indeed alarmed me was a news report in the\r\n\r\nStraits Times of the 28th of February. On the  front\r\n\r\npage of that newspaper it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"AUSSIES TO ASSESS MERDEKA PLAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia and New Zealand are expected to join in\r\n\r\nthe  test  to  find out if Singapore  is  ready  for\r\n\r\nMerdeka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Britain, these countries are planning to send\r\n\r\nall-Party parliamentary delegations to the Colony to\r\n\r\nassess Singapore's fitness for independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is unlikely that their delegations will\r\n\r\narrive   here  before  the  Colony's  April   self-government talks take place in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because of the short notice given to the\r\n\r\ngovernments of the two countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The likely acceptance of Australia and New Zealand\r\n\r\nto  participate in the Merdeka test was announced in\r\n\r\nSingapore  last  night  by  their  External  Affairs\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr R. G. Casey (Australia) and Mr T. L.

I can  only  say,\r\n\r\nSir,  that there is no better way than this for  the\r\n\r\nAustralians  and  the  New Zealanders  not  to  make\r\n\r\nfriends  and influence people in South-East Asia.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not understand how a small nation of ten million\r\n\r\npeople  in  an  enormous  continent  can  have   the\r\n\r\nimpertinence and the impudence to come along  in  an\r\n\r\nall-Party  delegation for a few weeks to assess  and\r\n\r\nto  examine my fitness to be my own master in my own\r\n\r\nhome.  We  all  understand that the Australians  are\r\n\r\nanxious  about the position in Malaya, because  they\r\n\r\nare  anxious about their own defence position in the\r\n\r\nPacific. They have joined in a military\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalliance   called   the   South-East   Asia   Treaty\r\n\r\nOrganisation  in  which they have persuaded  certain\r\n\r\nAsian countries to join them. We also know that they\r\n\r\nare extremely anxious to get Malaya and Singapore to\r\n\r\njoin in this South-East Asia Treaty Organisation. In\r\n\r\nfact,  they wanted to send troops to the  Colony  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   until  the  Hon. the  Chief   Minister\r\n\r\nindicated  that it would not be wise.  But,  however\r\n\r\nimperative  their  own need for  a  defence  outpost\r\n\r\nseveral thousand miles away from their own homeland,\r\n\r\nit  is  unforgivable arrogance on their  part, when\r\n\r\nthey  are not even the colonial power in Malaya,  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  they  are coming, like  the  British,  to\r\n\r\nassess Singapore's fitness for independence - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I am sure that he will agree with me that if\r\n\r\nsome  outsider - and an Australian is an  outsider  in\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan  context - comes along and says,  \"I  am\r\n\r\ngoing   to  see  whether  you  are  fit  to   govern\r\n\r\nyourselves independently of Britain\", all that I can\r\n\r\nsay to that Australian is, \"Hands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noff  Asia!

I\r\n\r\nhave  not heard the replies from either the External\r\n\r\nAffairs  Ministers  of  these  territories  or   the\r\n\r\nCommissioners that these Commonwealth countries have\r\n\r\nin  Malaya.  It  would  appear  that  they  have  no\r\n\r\nintention  of  coming  to  assess  our  fitness  for\r\n\r\nindependence.  They, being Asians,  would  know  the\r\n\r\nfeeling,  the temper and the attitude of  a  subject\r\n\r\npeople. On behalf of the Asians in Singapore, I tell\r\n\r\nthe  Australians and the New Zealanders that if they\r\n\r\nthink  they are coming here to share in the colonial\r\n\r\ntutelage  of this country, then they are making  one\r\n\r\nof  their greatest political blunders in the history\r\n\r\nof  the  Pacific. We all know that the British  want\r\n\r\ngently  to  ease  themselves out. Australian  troops\r\n\r\nhave  appeared.  The last time they  appeared  here,\r\n\r\nthey  left in a great hurry, including their  Major-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Shame!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, indeed. But let me tell\r\n\r\nthem this, that if they want to make friends - and  we\r\n\r\nwant to make friends with everybody - then the way  to\r\n\r\ndo  it  is  not to come and assess our  fitness  for\r\n\r\nindependence. \"Come, visit us, be our friends,  send\r\n\r\nus  reconstituted milk plants if you will.  Send  us\r\n\r\nthe  free  powdered  milk to work the  reconstituted\r\n\r\nmilk  plants if you like.\" But if they come to  test\r\n\r\nthe  fitness  of  our people for independence,  they\r\n\r\nwill  not find the friendly response which  as  good\r\n\r\nneighbours they would wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to this report, they\r\n\r\nare  not likely to come before April because of  the\r\n\r\nshort  notice  given to them. I  do  not  know  what\r\n\r\nuseful  purpose would be served if they  came  after\r\n\r\nApril  to  judge  our fitness for  independence.  By\r\n\r\nthen, certain  matters \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  settled between the all-Party delegation from Singapore  and the  British  Government in the Colonial  Office  in\r\n\r\nLondon. If they must send a delegation, let it be  a\r\n\r\ndelegation  to  foster trade between  Australia  and\r\n\r\nMalaya,   to  foster  more  friendliness  and   more\r\n\r\ncontacts between Australians and Malayans,  but  let\r\n\r\nit   have   nothing  to  do  with  our   fight   for\r\n\r\nindependence, because they are not our  masters  and\r\n\r\nwe will have none of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, in our struggle to\r\n\r\nachieve  freedom  from  colonialism  and  to  attain\r\n\r\nindependence, we now and then get sharply pulled  up\r\n\r\nwith   a  shock  by  conduct  which,  to  us,  seems\r\n\r\nincompatible with basic human decency. I  know  that\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore are a peaceable and a decent\r\n\r\npeople.   I   often  wonder  why   some   of   their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives are what they are. I know  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong  Pagar is  one  of  the  ablest\r\n\r\ndebaters, with a tremendous appreciation of his  own\r\n\r\noratory; and I would willingly move that for 29 days\r\n\r\nout of 30 in every month he should have the whole of\r\n\r\nthis   hall  to  himself,  to  speak  to   his   own\r\n\r\ndelectation,  if  we could have  avoided  this  most\r\n\r\nunfortunate, most untimely, most improper  and  most\r\n\r\nunfair   attack  on  neighbours  who   are   seeking\r\n\r\ngenuinely  to be nothing more than our  friends  and\r\n\r\nour  supporters. At a time when we in Singapore need\r\n\r\nevery  one who is a friend to stand by us,  that  we\r\n\r\nshould in this fashion slap them in the face because\r\n\r\nof  a report which does not even report in the first\r\n\r\nperson,  is,  Sir, a gratuitous insult.  Sir,  there\r\n\r\nmight   even   have   been  an   excuse   for   this\r\n\r\nextraordinary  tirade, but I said to  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nthis  morning, in the clearest possible words,  that\r\n\r\nthe   only   term   of  the  invitation   to   these\r\n\r\nCommonwealth countries with whom we aspire to be  in\r\n\r\npartnership was, as Singapore is seeking the  status\r\n\r\nof    an   independent   member   of   the   British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth,  that  the  Government  considered  it\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  invite all Dominion governments  to\r\n\r\nsend parliamentary delegations so that they may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave the opportunity to acquaint themselves fully of\r\n\r\nissues  which  may affect them arising  out  of  our\r\n\r\ndesire for independence within the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the invitation went from this Government, and\r\n\r\nit  is  because we seek to be their equal and it  is\r\n\r\nbecause, in seeking to be their equal, if we  should\r\n\r\nattain  that status, it would affect each and  every\r\n\r\nCommonwealth member, that we thought it only  proper\r\n\r\nto give them the opportunity, should they so desire,\r\n\r\nto  come  here  and  judge of the issues  which  may\r\n\r\naffect  their own status in accepting an  additional\r\n\r\nindependent member of the Commonwealth. No statement\r\n\r\nthat I know of has ever been made by Mr Casey or by\r\n\r\nMr  MacDonald, but the Straits Times  has  reported\r\n\r\nthat  they  are here. The Straits Times  itself  has\r\n\r\nmisunderstood. The purpose of this visit, as I  say,\r\n\r\nmight  have  been the occasion for a  question, but\r\n\r\nafter it had been made clear to this House that  the\r\n\r\npurpose was no more than that these Dominions should\r\n\r\nhave  their  rightful opportunity to  judge  of  the\r\n\r\nissues  which  might affect them  in  taking  in  an\r\n\r\nindependent  member into the Commonwealth, such  an\r\n\r\nattack, Sir, is utterly unreasonable and one that is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmost  unfortunate  in its timing when  we  need  our\r\n\r\nfriends;  most unfortunate in indicating that  there\r\n\r\nis  in this territory a group whose anti-white  hate\r\n\r\ngoes  beyond the bounds of logic and may spill  into\r\n\r\ncompletely unreasonable conduct, an example of which\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  has seen here this  afternoon.
