Owing  to  engineering\r\n\r\ndifficulties encountered in the area  edged  red\r\n\r\nand  the presence of squatters in the area edged\r\n\r\ngreen, the Port of Singapore Authority was  able\r\n\r\nto complete the reclamation of only 64 acres (47\r\n\r\nacres  within  the area edged red and  17  acres\r\n\r\nwithin the area edged green) out of the total of\r\n\r\n116  acres  so far approved under the Foreshores\r\n\r\nAct, leaving about 52 acres yet to he reclaimed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,  the  Port  of  Singapore  Authority,\r\n\r\nfaced by the need to urgently remove earth  from\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  Board's  Telok  Blangah  new  town\r\n\r\npreparatory  site  in order  not  to  delay  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of Housing Board flats  the  demand\r\n\r\nfor which considerably exceeds the supply, has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  forced  to dump fill in that part  of  the\r\n\r\nforeshore  and seabed shown hatched  red  within\r\n\r\nthe   area  shown  edged  purple  on  the  plan.\r\n\r\nApproval   of  this  House  is  now  sought   to\r\n\r\nregularise the reclamation done so far, as  well\r\n\r\nas   to  provide  for  the  reclamation  of   an\r\n\r\nadditional  area within the area  edged  purple.\r\n\r\nThis  will give time for the problems (squatters\r\n\r\nand  engineering difficulties)  to  be  overcome\r\n\r\nwhen  the reclamation of the remaining 52  acres\r\n\r\nalready  approved where reclamation  works  have\r\n\r\nbeen held up, can be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area edged purple, when reclaimed, will he\r\n\r\ndeveloped    for   recreational   purposes    in\r\n\r\naccordance with Singapore's Concept Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with\r\n\r\nsection  4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270),\r\n\r\napproves the reclamation by Government  of  that\r\n\r\nportion  of  the foreshore and seabed  at  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang containing an area of approximately  102\r\n\r\nacres  as  shown  edged in purple  on  the  plan\r\n\r\nmarked  \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO.  3/73\"\r\n\r\nwhich   is   deposited  in  the   Land   Office,\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CIVIL LIST</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of\r\n\r\nthe Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 52),\r\n\r\nresolves that the Schedule to the said Act be\r\n\r\nvaried by deleting the figures \"$48,000\".\r\n\r\n\"$508,620\", \"$108,680\" and \"523,000\" appearing\r\n\r\nin the second column thereof and substituting\r\n\r\ntherefor the figures \"$52,000\", \"$594,010\",\r\n\r\n\"$135,270\" and \"$91,000\" respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision approved under the Civil List is\r\n\r\ninsufficient to meet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreasing  expenses, such as  the  non-pensionable\r\n\r\nannual allowance for staff, revised wages of daily-rated  employees and increasing cost  of  household\r\n\r\nrequisites.

This represents an annual growth of 13 per\r\n\r\ncent,  a  creditable performance  by  international\r\n\r\nstandards, but disappointingly short by 2 per  cent\r\n\r\nof our targeted 15 per cent annual growth rate. One\r\n\r\nobvious  and simple explanation for this  shortfall\r\n\r\ncan  be  given as the loss of earnings from British\r\n\r\n(now   ANZUK)  military  spending  which  was  $216\r\n\r\nmillion or roughly 3 per cent of the GNP less  than\r\n\r\nlast  year.  We shall, however, need to analyse  in\r\n\r\nsome detail the more complex factors, both external\r\n\r\nand  domestic, which prevented gains being made  in\r\n\r\nother  sectors of our economy ready and  sufficient\r\n\r\nto  offset  a loss which had, after all, long  been\r\n\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us look at the external economic\r\n\r\nsituation in 1972. As an open economy. Singapore is\r\n\r\nhighly vulnerable to adverse external events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1972 began with some promise. It was hoped then\r\n\r\nthat the co-operative spirit and ingenuity shown by\r\n\r\nthe world's ten leading economic powers in reaching\r\n\r\nthe   settlement   of   the  Smithsonian   Currency\r\n\r\nAgreement   in  December  1971  could  be   brought\r\n\r\nsimilarly to bear upon the problem of the reform of\r\n\r\nthe  international monetary system.  Meantime,  the\r\n\r\nrecently  concluded  Agreement,  with  its   multi-currency  realignment, ended a period  of  floating\r\n\r\ncurrency  rates  and brought back a  relative  calm\r\n\r\ninto the troubled currency exchange markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calm was short-lived. 1972 turned out to be\r\n\r\na  year  of  high monetary instability. Within  the\r\n\r\nfirst\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfew months, funds started to flow to countries like\r\n\r\nJapan  where  revaluation was thought not  to  have\r\n\r\ngone  far enough, and away from countries like  the\r\n\r\nUnited    Kingdom   with   currencies    considered\r\n\r\novervalued. In June, the Pound Sterling went into a\r\n\r\ncrisis  which  introduced  yet  another  period  of\r\n\r\ninternational   monetary   instability.   It    was\r\n\r\neventually   forced  to  float.  Other   currencies\r\n\r\nsurvived  the  monetary  storm  only  because  they\r\n\r\nadopted  or  had  already  adopted  a  variety   of\r\n\r\nexchange controls, including stiff restrictions  on\r\n\r\ncapital movements, or splitting the exchange market\r\n\r\ninto financial and commercial sectors. Towards  the\r\n\r\nlatter  part  of 1972, however, the  United  States\r\n\r\neconomy  appeared  to  be much  improved,  and  the\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange markets stabilised.  However,  in\r\n\r\nthe  new year when it finally became known that the\r\n\r\nUS trade and payments deficits for 1972 were larger\r\n\r\nthan  had  been previously expected and  might  not\r\n\r\ngreatly  improve  in  1973,  the  situation   again\r\n\r\nsuddenly   deteriorated.  In  recent   weeks,   the\r\n\r\nsplitting of the Lira and the floating of the Swiss\r\n\r\nFranc were the first signs that the US Dollar would\r\n\r\ncome  once again under severe pressure. In a flight\r\n\r\nfrom the Dollar, both the Deutsche Mark and the Yen\r\n\r\ncame  under  attack, culminating in another  Dollar\r\n\r\ndevaluation and consequential adjustments in  other\r\n\r\ncurrency  parities. The basic flaws in the  present\r\n\r\nsystem  have not been resolved and the  spectre  of\r\n\r\nprotectionist  trade measures cannot be  altogether\r\n\r\nexorcised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not to be expected that Singapore could\r\n\r\nremain   totally   unaffected   by   the   monetary\r\n\r\ninstability  and the recurring crises of  the  past\r\n\r\nyear.  With  the floating of the Pound Sterling  in\r\n\r\nJune   last   year  and  restrictions  on   capital\r\n\r\nmovements   within  the  Sterling  area,  Singapore\r\n\r\ndecided  to  change its intervention currency  from\r\n\r\nSterling to the US Dollar. With less need  for  the\r\n\r\nuse  of Sterling, Singapore further diversified its\r\n\r\nreserves from Sterling to other currencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the hope which had been kindled for\r\n\r\n\"prompt\"  monetary reform? It was not  until  after\r\n\r\nprolonged argument as to the nature and composition\r\n\r\nof  the  forum for discussing such reform that  the\r\n\r\nfirst  step was taken at the IMF meeting in October\r\n\r\nlast   year.  This  was  the  setting  up  of   the\r\n\r\nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Committee  on\r\n\r\nInternational  Monetary Reform and Related  Issues,\r\n\r\nbetter known as the Committee of Twenty. Basically,\r\n\r\nthe  representation of countries on this  Committee\r\n\r\nis the same as representation on the IMF (which has\r\n\r\n20    executive    directors).   The    level    of\r\n\r\nrepresentation is higher, however, in the Committee\r\n\r\nof   20  consisting  of  Ministers,  central   bank\r\n\r\ngovernors or equivalent. Singapore anti other South-east  Asian countries are being represented on this\r\n\r\nCommittee,  and  on  this  Committee's   group   of\r\n\r\ndeputies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the initial deliberations of the Committee\r\n\r\npoint   to  some  convergence  of  views  on  broad\r\n\r\nprinciples, the deputies of the Committee have  met\r\n\r\nfor  only  the  second time, and it  would  be  too\r\n\r\noptimistic to expect any translation of these broad\r\n\r\nprinciples  into  agreed rules and practice  before\r\n\r\n1974.  Singapore, therefore, will have to learn  to\r\n\r\nlive  with  international monetary instability  for\r\n\r\nquite some time yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overshadowed by the monetary problem, other\r\n\r\nexternal events in 1972 have had relatively  little\r\n\r\neconomic impact as yet upon Singapore. Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nmost  significant  of these for its  likely  future\r\n\r\neffect  upon  Singapore trade was the dc-escalation\r\n\r\nof  the  Vietnam War which has now  resulted  in  a\r\n\r\ncease-fire.  In  the past, Singapore's  trade  with\r\n\r\nSouth   Vietnam  has  been  mainly   in   petroleum\r\n\r\nproducts.  With  the  advent of  peace,  there  has\r\n\r\nincreasingly been less demand for such products and\r\n\r\nit may be expected to decline further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1972 was also the last year for preparation by\r\n\r\nBritain  for her entry into the Common Market.  For\r\n\r\nher  Commonwealth partners, it meant also the  last\r\n\r\nyear  before  the  phasing out of  special  trading\r\n\r\nrelationships    which    conferred    Commonwealth\r\n\r\npreferences to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBritain   and   each  other.  For   the   non-Asian\r\n\r\nCommonwealth, such phasing out could  be  eased  by\r\n\r\nnew trading arrangements in associate status in the\r\n\r\nEuropean  Economic Community (EEC)  or  by  special\r\n\r\nconcessions for products like sugar. For her  Asian\r\n\r\nCommonwealth partners, including Singapore, none of\r\n\r\nthese   options  were  offered  by  the   EEC   and\r\n\r\nnegotiations  for individual trade agreements  with\r\n\r\nthe  EEC  are all that they can expect. Singapore's\r\n\r\nshare  of trade with the EEC has all along been  in\r\n\r\nthe   EEC's   favour.  The  better  to  investigate\r\n\r\npossibilities  of improving trade  links  with  the\r\n\r\nenlarged EEC, whether under a negotiated agreement,\r\n\r\nthe  Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) Scheme\r\n\r\nor  in  any  other way, we have in  the  last  year\r\n\r\nestablished  an Embassy in Brussels  accredited  to\r\n\r\nboth Belgium and the EEC, and shall be establishing\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  representation also in other  countries\r\n\r\nin  the  near  future. We have  also  been  working\r\n\r\ntogether with our ASEAN partners under the  Special\r\n\r\nCo-ordinating Committee of ASEAN to seek favourable\r\n\r\nconsideration for our products. However,  the  task\r\n\r\nahead  for securing any trade concessions from  the\r\n\r\nEEC  would  seem  to  be a long  and  arduous  one,\r\n\r\nespecially  as  1973 would be a year of  adjustment\r\n\r\nand  consolidation between the old and new  members\r\n\r\nin   the  enlarged  EEC  and  the  Community  could\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  pre-occupied with its  own  internal\r\n\r\nproblems.  However, it is possible that with  peace\r\n\r\nin  Indo-China, the EEC will show a  more  positive\r\n\r\ninterest  in  the region and to play a more  active\r\n\r\nrole in trade and development of an area with which\r\n\r\nthey have had historical links.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, among external events relevant to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the admission of China into the  United\r\n\r\nNations   in   1972,   and   therefore   into   the\r\n\r\ninternational diplomatic and political  arena,  may\r\n\r\nsee  its  involvement  increase  also  in  economic\r\n\r\naffairs   in  South-east  Asia.  There  should   be\r\n\r\npossibilities of much increased trade. Total  trade\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and China  in  the  first  nine\r\n\r\nmonths of 1972\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresented  less  than 3 per cent  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\ntotal  trade,  and  the  trade  balance  has   been\r\n\r\noverwhelmingly in favour of China. With the  better\r\n\r\nopening  up of China to international trade,  there\r\n\r\nis  the possibility that Singapore can serve  as  a\r\n\r\nbase  for multi-national firms for manufacture  and\r\n\r\nexports  to  China.  Conversely,  China  may   find\r\n\r\nSingapore a useful outlet for its products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Review of the Singapore Economy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, a close look at developments at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can well be imagined, international monetary\r\n\r\ninstability  had  unfavourable  effects  upon   the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  our  local economy,  its  greatest\r\n\r\nimpact being, first, on trade which grew hardly  at\r\n\r\nall  in  the first half of the year and only picked\r\n\r\nup  again  in  the later months of  the  year,  and\r\n\r\nsecondly, on the manufacturing sector, particularly\r\n\r\non   industries   highly  vulnerable   to   adverse\r\n\r\ninternational  trade  factors  like  the  petroleum\r\n\r\nindustry, which grew at no more than 7 per cent  in\r\n\r\noutput  and  2.6  per  cent  in  value  added.  Our\r\n\r\nperformance  in  these two sectors  fell  short  of\r\n\r\nthose  for  1970  and  1971 and  account  in  large\r\n\r\nmeasure  for the lower growth rate of the  economy,\r\n\r\nmaking up as they do, its two largest sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as the GNP figures already quoted indicate,\r\n\r\nand the tables will show in greater detail, overall\r\n\r\nthe  economy of Singapore continued to sustain  the\r\n\r\ntrend  of  rapid growth achieved over the past  six\r\n\r\nyears  1966-1971. With a rate of population  growth\r\n\r\nat  1.7  per cent per year in 1972, slightly higher\r\n\r\nthan the 1.69 per cent for 1971, our per capita GNP\r\n\r\nimproved  by  11 per cent from $3,321  in  1971  to\r\n\r\n$3,687 in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us examine the components of Singapore's\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of the Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE)\r\n\r\nin  1972  representing  resource  use  indicate  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of $927.3 million to $7,643.7 million  in\r\n\r\n1972.  Compared with the $6,716.4 million in  1971,\r\n\r\nthis represented an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease of 13.8 per cent. The growth rate  of  GDE\r\n\r\nwas  lower than that experienced in 1971  of  about\r\n\r\n16.6 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in GDE was contributed by both\r\n\r\nconsumption  and gross domestic capital  formation.\r\n\r\nConsumption expenditure increased by $507.0 million\r\n\r\nor 10.5 per cent to reach $5,355.8 million. Capital\r\n\r\nformation increased substantially by $420.3 million\r\n\r\nor  22.5 per cent to reach a high level of $2,287.9\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the capital formation was in\r\n\r\nbuildings   and  other  construction  works   which\r\n\r\ncomprised about 48.3 per cent of the total  and  in\r\n\r\nmachinery  and equipment which accounted  for  39.7\r\n\r\nper cent. A large proportion of the expenditure  in\r\n\r\nthe   latter  category  was  directed  towards  the\r\n\r\nexpanding manufacturing sector. Expenditure in  the\r\n\r\nformer category increased by $316.3 million or 40.1\r\n\r\nper  cent  as  compared to an  increase  of  $118.1\r\n\r\nmillion  or  only  15  per cent  in  machinery  and\r\n\r\nequipment.   Expenditure  in  transport   equipment\r\n\r\ndropped  slightly by $14.1 million or 4.9 per  cent\r\n\r\nto $274.6 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth in gross domestic capital formation\r\n\r\nwas  markedly lower than the 35.8 per cent achieved\r\n\r\nin  1971  and  the 44.2 per cent in  1970  and  the\r\n\r\naverage  annual growth rate of 30 per cent for  the\r\n\r\nsix-year period 1966-72. It is disquieting to  note\r\n\r\nthat  the  growth  in  1972 was  sustained  by  the\r\n\r\nrelatively higher growth rate in the expenditure on\r\n\r\nbuildings, especially on dwellings rather  than  on\r\n\r\nmachinery and equipment for manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysing the capital formation in 1972 in both\r\n\r\nthe  public  and private sectors, it  may  also  be\r\n\r\nnoted that private sector investments rose by  only\r\n\r\n12.1  per  cent from $1,407.3 million  in  1971  to\r\n\r\n$1,577.6  million, while public sector  investments\r\n\r\nincreased by 54.3 per cent to $710.3 million.  With\r\n\r\na faster rate of growth, the capital expenditure in\r\n\r\nthe public sector, accounted for a larger share  of\r\n\r\n31  per  cent  of  the total capital  formation  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with  only 24.6 per  cent  in  1971.  The\r\n\r\ncorresponding share of the private sector was down\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  69 per cent. The increase in investment in  the\r\n\r\nprivate   sector  was  mainly  in   machinery   and\r\n\r\nequipment   and   construction  of  non-residential\r\n\r\nbuildings, primarily of offices, shopping complexes\r\n\r\nand  factories.  There was a  slight  reduction  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in  transport  equipment   and   other\r\n\r\nconstruction   works.  Expenditure   on   transport\r\n\r\nequipment in the private sector decreased  slightly\r\n\r\nby  $19.2  million from $283.1 million in  1971  to\r\n\r\n$263.9 million, giving a drop of 6.8 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in capital expenditure in the public\r\n\r\nsector  was  largely in respect of public  housing,\r\n\r\nelectricity   and  water  services   and   electric\r\n\r\nmachinery.   Expenditure   on   buildings,    other\r\n\r\nconstruction and works increased by $225 million or\r\n\r\n67.8 per cent from $332 million to $557 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consumption</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to consumption, the public sector\r\n\r\nregistered a faster rate of growth of 17.9 per cent\r\n\r\ncompared  with the private sector of 9.1 per  cent.\r\n\r\nThe  increase in public consumption, which has been\r\n\r\nexpanding  rapidly  since 1969, exceeded  the  rate\r\n\r\nachieved in the previous year of 12.5 per cent.  In\r\n\r\nthe   private  sector,  the  rate  of   growth   of\r\n\r\nconsumption  was slightly below the level  of  10.3\r\n\r\nper cent achieved in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these changes the share\r\n\r\ncomposition of private consumption expenditure fell\r\n\r\nfrom  60.8  per cent in 1971 to 58.3  per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1972,   whilst   that  of  government   consumption\r\n\r\nincreased from 11.4 per cent to 11.8 per  cent.  It\r\n\r\nis   interesting  to  note  that   the   share   of\r\n\r\nconsumption  expenditure to  total  expenditure  in\r\n\r\nboth  the public and private sector which has  been\r\n\r\nfalling  since 1960 continued to decline  in  1972.\r\n\r\nThe  share composition fell from 93.4 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1960 to 72.2 per cent in 1971 and to 70.1  per  cent  in 1972, while the  gross  capital\r\n\r\nformation  increased sharply from 6.6 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1960 to 29.9 per cent in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every major component of private consumption\r\n\r\nregistered increases, though at varying rates.  The\r\n\r\nfastest  rates  of  increase  were  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non   housing   and  transport  and  communications.\r\n\r\nExpenditure  on housing increased by $92.5  million\r\n\r\nor   25.1   per  cent  to  $461.6  million   whilst\r\n\r\nexpenditure on transport rose by $54.2  million  or\r\n\r\n9.8  per  cent  to  $608.7  million.  Comparatively\r\n\r\nslower   rates   of  growth  were  noted   in   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure on food, which rose by 5.3 per cent  to\r\n\r\n$1,079.2  million,  as well as in  clothing,  which\r\n\r\nincreased  by  6.3 per cent to $643.4 million.  The\r\n\r\noutcome  of this was the further reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nrelative share of expenditure on basic necessities,\r\n\r\nespecially food, which fell from 27.2 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1960  to 15.3 per cent in 1971 and to 14.1 per cent\r\n\r\nin  1972.  This again reflected the improvement  in\r\n\r\nthe  standards of living of the population. In  the\r\n\r\ncase of public consumption, the increase was mainly\r\n\r\non account of defence expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Gross Domestic Production by Industrial Origin</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to an examination of the performance of the\r\n\r\nmajor  sectors  of  the  economy  in  1972,  it  is\r\n\r\npertinent  to outline the structural changes  which\r\n\r\nhave  taken  place over the past six  years.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult    of    rapid    industrialisation,     the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and  construction  sectors   enjoyed\r\n\r\nrapid  growth  whilst the trade and other  services\r\n\r\nsectors registered a lower rate of growth. This has\r\n\r\nresulted  in  the  sharp increase in  the  relative\r\n\r\nshare  composition in Gross Domestic Product  (GDP)\r\n\r\nof  manufacturing and construction sectors  jointly\r\n\r\nfrom  18.3 per cent in 1966 to 31 per cent in 1972.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, the share composition of  trade\r\n\r\nand  other services sectors declined from 63.5  per\r\n\r\ncent in 1966 to 52.3 per cent in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manufacturing Sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing industries contributed a total\r\n\r\nof $1,716.6 million to GDP in 1972 - an increase of\r\n\r\n$286.9  million or 20.1 per cent compared  with  25\r\n\r\nper  cent in 1971 and 27.5 per cent in 1970.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult of this comparatively more modest but  still\r\n\r\nrapid   growth,  the  share  composition   of   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector to total GDP  increased  from\r\n\r\n14.5 per cent in 1966 to 23.5 per cent in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManufacturing  still  continues  to  be  the   main\r\n\r\nstimulus to growth. The increase in earnings of the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector of $286.9  million  accounted\r\n\r\nfor  well  over a third of the increase  of  $857.6\r\n\r\nmillion in the GDP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing industries have been oriented\r\n\r\ntowards   exports  and  higher  quality   products.\r\n\r\nOverall,   some  40  per  cent  of   our   domestic\r\n\r\nmanufactures is exported. Among pioneer  companies,\r\n\r\nexports account for just under two-thirds of  their\r\n\r\noutput. In 1972, about half of our domestic exports\r\n\r\nwent  to developed countries as compared with  less\r\n\r\nthan one-fifth six years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year 1972, increases in output and\r\n\r\nvalue  added were registered in the major  industry\r\n\r\ngroups,   such  as  manufacture  of  textiles   and\r\n\r\ngarments,   electrical  machinery,  apparatus   and\r\n\r\nappliances, and manufacture of transport equipment.\r\n\r\nOther  industries recording favourable growth  were\r\n\r\nthe  manufacture  of  other plastic  products,  and\r\n\r\nprecision equipment and optical goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest individual industry is still\r\n\r\npetroleum  refining which accounted  for  30.7  per\r\n\r\ncent  of total output for the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\nDuring  1972, however, as I have already mentioned,\r\n\r\nthe growth in output and value added slackened to 7\r\n\r\nper   cent  and  2.6  per  cent  respectively.  The\r\n\r\ncorresponding  growth rates in 1971 were  27.2  per\r\n\r\ncent  and  33.6  per  cent, respectively.  Although\r\n\r\npetroleum refining is a major activity in terms  of\r\n\r\noutput, in terms of value added the contribution of\r\n\r\nthis industry to total value added is only 17.5 per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marginal decrease of 6.3 per cent in output of\r\n\r\nthe food industries was noted. This was largely  on\r\n\r\naccount  of  the slight drop in the production  for\r\n\r\nexport in cooking oil and coffee processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of value added, the electric machinery\r\n\r\nindustry ranked the highest with 20.6 per  cent  of\r\n\r\ntotal   value  added,  followed  closely   by   the\r\n\r\npetroleum   refining  (17.5  per  cent)   and   the\r\n\r\ntransport equipment industry (which included\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshipbuilding and shiprepairing) with 14.9 per  cent\r\n\r\nof   total   value  added.  The  more   traditional\r\n\r\nindustries,  namely  food, beverages  and  tobacco,\r\n\r\njointly accounted for another 9.4 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Construction</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry has been growing\r\n\r\nrapidly  since  1967. In 1972 the  contribution  by\r\n\r\nthis  sector to GDP increased by 36.4 per  cent  to\r\n\r\n$551.9  million as compared with 33.8 per  cent  in\r\n\r\n1971.  Its  percentage share  of  GDP  was  thereby\r\n\r\nalmost doubled from 3.8 per cent in 1966 to 7.5 per\r\n\r\ncent in 1972. This rapid growth rate was the second\r\n\r\nhighest for the six-year period 1966-72-the highest\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate was in 1971) when a rate of  47.2  per\r\n\r\ncent was registered. The industry continued to face\r\n\r\nthe  shortage of labour and materials which  had  a\r\n\r\nrestraining influence on its expansion during 1971.\r\n\r\nDespite  this, the industry managed  to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nhigh growth rate which ranked as the highest of all\r\n\r\nmajor sectors making up the GDP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slight acceleration in its growth during 1972\r\n\r\nwas   primarily   in  respect  of   non-residential\r\n\r\nbuildings  in the private sector comprising  mainly\r\n\r\nof  shopping and office complexes which  registered\r\n\r\nan increase of $79.1 million or 25 per cent. In the\r\n\r\npublic  sector,  the  high  growth  was  mainly  on\r\n\r\naccount of the construction of public housing which\r\n\r\nrecorded an increase of $133.4 million or 109.6 per\r\n\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trade</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrepot and domestic trade sector which had\r\n\r\nbeen  growing  at  a  decreasing  rate  since  1968\r\n\r\ncontributed  $1,982.5 million to GDP in  1972.  The\r\n\r\ncontribution from this sector increased by only 7.3\r\n\r\nper  cent  or  $134.1 million  in  1972  which  was\r\n\r\ncomparable to the rate in 1971 but slower than  the\r\n\r\naverage  rate  of  14.8 per cent for  1968-70.  The\r\n\r\ncauses  for  this were the pursuit of direct  trade\r\n\r\npolicies  by neighbours, the general decline  until\r\n\r\nthe  latter  part  of the year  in  produce  prices\r\n\r\nespecially rubber,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  de-escalation  of  the  Vietnam  War  and  the\r\n\r\nuncertain  trading conditions particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half  of  the year because of the  recurring\r\n\r\ninternational monetary crises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total increase in the trade sector,\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade accounted for a mere $13.5  million\r\n\r\nwhile  domestic trade accounted for $120.6 million.\r\n\r\nThe   entrepot   trade   component   registered   a\r\n\r\ndecelerating growth rate from 31.9 per cent in 1968\r\n\r\nto a low rate of 2 per cent in 1972. Domestic trade\r\n\r\nalso   registered   a  decelerating   growth   rate\r\n\r\nespecially after 1970, from 18.1 per cent  in  1970\r\n\r\nto  an  all time low rate of 10.3 per cent in 1972.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these decelerating growth rates, the\r\n\r\nratio of entrepot trade to total GDP fell from 12.1\r\n\r\nper  cent in 1970 to 9.5 per cent in 1972 while for\r\n\r\ndomestic trade the ratio fell slightly from the  18\r\n\r\nper cent in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the trade sector, the shift in emphasis in\r\n\r\nfavour of domestic trade against entrepot trade may\r\n\r\nbe  noted.  In  1960 entrepot trade  constituted  a\r\n\r\nlarger share of 18.6 per cent of GDP as compared to\r\n\r\na  share  of  13.2  per  cent for  domestic  trade.\r\n\r\nHowever, the relative share of entrepot trade  soon\r\n\r\ndecreased to 10.4 per cent in 1966 whilst that  for\r\n\r\ndomestic trade increased to 15.7 per cent. By 1972,\r\n\r\nentrepot trade was further reduced to 9.5 per  cent\r\n\r\nwhilst domestic trade advanced to 17.6 per cent. In\r\n\r\nvalue terms entrepot trade contributed $694 million\r\n\r\nto  GDP in 1972 compared with $1,288.5 million  for\r\n\r\ndomestic trade. The opposite was, however, the case\r\n\r\nin  1960  when  entrepot trade amounted  to  $381.1\r\n\r\nmillion and domestic trade $269 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing importance of domestic trade has been\r\n\r\nthe  result of the rising purchasing power  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  and  the increased  earnings  from  the\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  domestic export which  has  shown\r\n\r\nsubstantial  growth during the past few  years.  As\r\n\r\nthe economy further expands in the future, entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  is expected to decline further in importance\r\n\r\nand  this  decline will be offset by the growth  in\r\n\r\nthe domestic trade sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Total External Trade</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total external trade expanded to $15,680\r\n\r\nmillion  in 1972, an increase of $1,645 million  or\r\n\r\n11.7  per cent over 1971. The growth rate, however,\r\n\r\nwas  lower than the 14.2 per cent achieved in 1971.\r\n\r\nExports  rose at a faster rate of 14.3 per cent  to\r\n\r\n$6,139 million, imports at a relatively lower  rate\r\n\r\nof  10.1  per cent to $9,541 million in  1972.

This slow-down in the growth  of\r\n\r\nimports  was mainly on account of less  imports  of\r\n\r\nfixed vegetable oil, textiles, industrial machinery\r\n\r\nand road motor vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic exports, which rose by 29.7 per cent to\r\n\r\n$3,078 million in 1972, was again the primary cause\r\n\r\nof  the  increase in total exports. The  comparable\r\n\r\nfigure  was  $2,373  million  in  1971.  With   the\r\n\r\ncontinued  expansion  in  the  local  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries and the efforts being made to  open  new\r\n\r\nmarkets overseas, this upward trend is expected  to\r\n\r\nbe  maintained.  On the other hand,  re-exports  or\r\n\r\nentrepot exports increased only marginally  by  2.1\r\n\r\nper  cent  from  $2,998 million in 1971  to  $3,061\r\n\r\nmillion in 1972.

The widening gap particularly  in\r\n\r\nrecent  years has been aggravated by higher  prices\r\n\r\nfor  imported goods. Singapore has run a persistent\r\n\r\ntrade  deficit which has been largely  financed  by\r\n\r\nearnings  from `invisible' items and large  capital\r\n\r\ninflows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst there may be some concern for the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of our growing trade deficit  on  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of payments, there is basically  no  cause\r\n\r\nfor  alarm.  Since  1966  our  overall  balance  of\r\n\r\npayments has been registering surpluses every year.\r\n\r\nFrom  1967 to 1971 the overall surpluses have  been\r\n\r\naveraging\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  $500  million  a  year.

The decline was attributable\r\n\r\nto   the  increase  in  payments  for  freight  and\r\n\r\ninsurance   on   merchandise,  travel   and   other\r\n\r\ntransportation and other services as well as to the\r\n\r\nreduction  in receipts from government transactions\r\n\r\nas  a  result of the British military pullout.

This rate of  growth  was\r\n\r\nslightly  higher than the previous year's  rate  of\r\n\r\n9.6  per  cent.  It is close to the average  annual\r\n\r\ngrowth rate of 13.4 per cent for the past 12 years.\r\n\r\nThe   share  of  government  services  to  GDP  was\r\n\r\nmaintained  at  6.6 per cent for  1972,  about  the\r\n\r\nlevel  maintained during the past decade. The  main\r\n\r\nincreases   were  in  respect  of  expenditure   on\r\n\r\ndefence, education and health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Utilities had a steady growth rate of 15.2\r\n\r\nper  cent higher than the 9.8 per cent increase for\r\n\r\n1971.  The  contribution of this  sector  was  $175\r\n\r\nmillion in 1972 and its share to GDP was maintained\r\n\r\nat 2.4 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Ownership of Dwellings</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value added by ownership of dwellings to GDP\r\n\r\nincreased substantially during the past two  years.\r\n\r\nIn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1971 the value stood at $275.6 million, an increase\r\n\r\nof  35  per  cent. In 1972, the value increased  to\r\n\r\n$362.3 million, a growth rate of 31.5 per cent.  As\r\n\r\na result, its share composition rose to about 5 per\r\n\r\ncent of GDP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tourism</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourist industry continues to enjoy rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth. In 1972 an estimated total of about 780,000\r\n\r\ntourists visited Singapore compared with 632,000 in\r\n\r\n1971  and  522,000 in 1970. The rate of growth  for\r\n\r\n1972  was 23.4 per cent, as compared with 21.1  per\r\n\r\ncent in 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings from tourism continued to increase to S\r\n\r\n397.7 million in 1972, an increase of 21.4 per cent\r\n\r\nover  $327.5 million for 1971. This resulted  in  a\r\n\r\nmarginal  increase  in  the  share  composition  of\r\n\r\ntourism to GDP from 5.1 per cent in 1971 to 5.4 per\r\n\r\ncent  in  1972.  The  average number  of  days  the\r\n\r\nvisitors  spent in Singapore remained at about  3.9\r\n\r\ndays during 1970-72.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foreign Military Expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The withdrawal of the British military services\r\n\r\nin  1972  resulted in a dramatic reduction by  51.4\r\n\r\nper  cent in the preliminary estimates for  foreign\r\n\r\nmilitary   expenditure   to   $204   million.   The\r\n\r\nexpenditure in 1971 was $420 million, which was the\r\n\r\nsame  level as in 1970. However, owing to the rapid\r\n\r\ngrowth in the other services sector, especially  in\r\n\r\nbanking   and  financial  services,  and  transport\r\n\r\nsector, the dampening effect on domestic demand and\r\n\r\nemployment had been partly compensated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Banking and insurance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking and insurance services continued their\r\n\r\nincreasing trends. By 1972 its contribution to  GDP\r\n\r\nrose  by  26.6  per  cent  to  $152.3  million,  as\r\n\r\ncompared to 22.9 per cent in 1971. This high growth\r\n\r\nrate  was attributable mainly to the high level  of\r\n\r\nbanking activity, a feature of which was the inflow\r\n\r\nof  funds  from  abroad. Total deposits  showed  an\r\n\r\nunprecedented  increase  of  26.5  per  cent   from\r\n\r\n$3,745.8  million  in 1971 to $4,736.7  million  in\r\n\r\n1972. Bank loans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand advances increased faster by 36.3 per cent from\r\n\r\n$2,615 million to $3,565.2 million in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total assets and liabilities of the Asian\r\n\r\nCurrency Unit (ACU) rose steeply by 180 per cent to\r\n\r\nreach  $8.4  billion at the end of  December  1972.\r\n\r\nHitherto,  funds from the Asian Dollar Market  were\r\n\r\nused  mainly for short-term financing. A new  phase\r\n\r\nof  development occurred in December 1971 when  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank of Singapore Limited (DBS) floated\r\n\r\na 10-year Asian Dollar Bond for US$10 million. This\r\n\r\nwas  followed  by an Asian Dollar loan  of  US$27.5\r\n\r\nmillion  to  the  Brunei LNG  Company  Limited.  In\r\n\r\nOctober, the Singapore Government itself floated  a\r\n\r\n15-year US$20 million Asian Dollar Bond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institutional framework for operations of an\r\n\r\nactive   money  market  in  Singapore  was  further\r\n\r\nstrengthened  last  year.  Three  reputable  London\r\n\r\nmoney  broking firms were given approval to set  up\r\n\r\noperations   in   Singapore.  In  November,   three\r\n\r\nDiscount  Houses were also established,  comprising\r\n\r\njoint  ventures between local and foreign  interest\r\n\r\nwith   majority  participation  by   local   banks,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Post Office Savings Bank.  Two  new\r\n\r\nforeign   banks   were  admitted  into   Singapore,\r\n\r\nbroadening international connections of the banking\r\n\r\nsystem.  Singapore banks also organised  themselves\r\n\r\nfor  the more competitive banking environment ahead\r\n\r\nby merging into bigger groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the external and domestic economic situation\r\n\r\nin  1972  outlined in the Survey, what  conclusions\r\n\r\ncan we draw as to the possibilities for 1973?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of symptoms call for particular\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Inflation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that of increasing inflation. With\r\n\r\nits  relatively strong currency, Singapore has  had\r\n\r\ninflows   of  speculative  funds  which   increased\r\n\r\ndomestic   liquidity   beyond   desirable   limits.\r\n\r\nDomestic  money supply increased by $76 million  in\r\n\r\nthe  first quarter of 1972. Another $98 million was\r\n\r\nadded to the money stock in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  second quarter. The rate of monetary expansion\r\n\r\nfor  the  year  ending June 1972 was 24  per  cent,\r\n\r\nwhich  was unusually high as growth in money supply\r\n\r\nin  previous years had been less than 20 per  cent.\r\n\r\nIn  the  third  quarter, there was  again  a  large\r\n\r\nincrease of $115 million, bringing the total  money\r\n\r\nsupply to $2.1 billion in September. By the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  fourth  quarter in December 1972, total  money\r\n\r\nsupply had increased to $2.4 billion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some expansion of money supply in Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  be  expected and indeed would be required  to\r\n\r\nmeet the expanding needs of a fast growing country,\r\n\r\nit  was necessary that measures be taken to prevent\r\n\r\noverheating of the economy. The Monetary  Authority\r\n\r\nof  Singapore (MAS) therefore tried in August  1972\r\n\r\nto  curb excessive liquidity by raising the minimum\r\n\r\nreserves requirement of banks from 3 1/2 per cent to\r\n\r\n5 per cent. In December 1972, the MAS had to impose\r\n\r\na 5 per cent special deposit requirement on the net\r\n\r\nforeign liabilities of banks. On 13th February this\r\n\r\nyear, the reserves requirement has had to be raised\r\n\r\nagain  from  5  per  cent to 9 per  cent  of  their\r\n\r\ndeposit  liabilities. The Special Deposit  -  which\r\n\r\nbanks have to place with the MAS against their  net\r\n\r\nforeign liabilities was similarly increased from  5\r\n\r\nper  cent to 9 per cent. These measures will freeze\r\n\r\nabout  $250  million  in the financial  system  and\r\n\r\nincrease  the  cost  of  credit;  they  will   also\r\n\r\ncircumscribe   the  banks'  capacity   for   credit\r\n\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried to organise our banking and money\r\n\r\nsector  into  external (Asian  Currency  Unit)  and\r\n\r\ndomestic  operations, but it has not been  possible\r\n\r\nto    isolate   Singapore   entirely    from    the\r\n\r\ninternational money and price inflation  which  has\r\n\r\nsuch  deleterious social and economic effects  upon\r\n\r\nour  people. The will to work hard and  to  save  a\r\n\r\nlarge  part  of one's earnings can be sapped  by  a\r\n\r\ncontinual lowering of the purchasing power of hard-earned money, coupled with the belief that the ways\r\n\r\nof  the  speculator and the spiv with his get-rich-quick gimmicks bring easy returns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the money supply has partly\r\n\r\ncontributed to the increase towards the end of  the\r\n\r\nyear  of  food and other commodity prices. But  the\r\n\r\nmain  causes were more the vagaries of the  weather\r\n\r\nand  the  sharp increases in costs of imports.  But\r\n\r\ninternal  liquidity certainly has been  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the  boom in land and property prices and  the\r\n\r\nvery  unhealthy speculation in shares on our  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While public confidence in the performance and\r\n\r\nprogress  of the economy was an underlying  factor,\r\n\r\nthe  steep  climb in share prices in recent  months\r\n\r\nwas  fuelled  largely by strong speculative  demand\r\n\r\nwhich  was  stimulated in part by the international\r\n\r\ncurrency  problems. Some speculative  interest  can\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the growth of a healthy market.  But\r\n\r\nexcessive  speculation will lead to  disruption  of\r\n\r\nthe  development  of  the  Stock  Exchange  as   an\r\n\r\ninstitution  for  funnelling private  savings  into\r\n\r\nproductive  investments. The Stock  Exchange  shows\r\n\r\nall  the  signs of an overheated market. While  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  no desire to cause  a  precipitous\r\n\r\nfall  of  the  market, I wish  to  outline  certain\r\n\r\nmeasures  which could lead to an abatement  of  the\r\n\r\nfeverish tempo. These measures are expected to have\r\n\r\na  speedy, effective and persistent impact  on  the\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure concerns credit facilities provided\r\n\r\nby   banks  and  other  financial  institutions  to\r\n\r\noperators   in   the  stock  market   against   the\r\n\r\ncollateral of scrip. It is the practice of banks to\r\n\r\noffer  credit  limited  to  a  certain  percentage,\r\n\r\nvarying  with the philosophy of each bank,  of  the\r\n\r\nprevailing   market  price  of  scrip  offered   as\r\n\r\ncollateral.  Needless to say as the market  spirals\r\n\r\nupwards,  shareholders enjoy the use of  additional\r\n\r\nfunds  to propel the market forward even faster.  I\r\n\r\nam  therefore  asking  the  Monetary  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  draw up guidelines  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nprudent lending limits are observed. There will, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  be  consultations with banks  and  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  consider lending criteria  that  are\r\n\r\nmore  realistically  based and applied  by  prudent\r\n\r\nbankers and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinanciers.  Obvious  risks arise  if  unrestricted\r\n\r\nloans  are  made  on  the basis of  inflated  share\r\n\r\nprices in an overheated market. Should this measure\r\n\r\nbe  implemented, a large volume of funds  available\r\n\r\nto operators will be immobilized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feature of the current bull market, not only in\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia but in nearby territories as\r\n\r\nwell,  is  the  spate  of  take-overs  and  mergers\r\n\r\ninvolving  the exchange of paper. Not surprisingly,\r\n\r\nthis  paper merry-go-round is uncritically accepted\r\n\r\nwhen  the  market roars along. When the  market  is\r\n\r\ndepressed,  corn-panics practise the  old-fashioned\r\n\r\nvirtue of offering hard cash for acquisitions. I am\r\n\r\nasking  the  Securities Industry Council  (SIC)  to\r\n\r\ngive the most careful scrutiny to all proposals for\r\n\r\ntake-overs  and mergers, particularly  those  where\r\n\r\nsettlement  is partly or wholly by an  exchange  of\r\n\r\nscrip.  The  SIC  jurisdiction  will  cover  public\r\n\r\nlisted companies incorporated in Singapore as  well\r\n\r\nas non-listed subsidiaries of these companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these two specific measures, as\r\n\r\nMembers  are  aware,  on  16th  February  1973,   I\r\n\r\nintroduced  a Bill in Parliament designed  to  give\r\n\r\nthe  Government  more effective  control  over  the\r\n\r\nsecurities industry. The new Bill will replace  the\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry Act passed in 1970  but  never\r\n\r\nbrought  into  force.  The  Bill  was  drafted   in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  the  Malaysian  Government  and\r\n\r\ncontains  several improvements over the  1970  Act.\r\n\r\nThe new Act will give the Government wide powers to\r\n\r\ninvestigate manipulations and other abuses  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  which  at  present go  unchecked,  and  to\r\n\r\npunish the offenders appropriately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trade and Manufacturing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further distressing symptom is the unevenness\r\n\r\nin  development  of the economy. While  almost  all\r\n\r\nsectors grew satisfactorily, the development in the\r\n\r\ntwo  largest, trade and manufacturing, has not been\r\n\r\nlarge enough for their effect upon total growth  to\r\n\r\nhave been most pronounced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trade</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, trade earnings now constitute 27.1 per\r\n\r\ncent  of  our GDP. It grew by only 7.3 per cent  as\r\n\r\nagainst  7.2 per cent for 1971 when world  monetary\r\n\r\nconditions  were equally troubled. But the  average\r\n\r\ngrowth under more settled conditions from 1966-1970\r\n\r\nwas  17.5 per cent. An extra 10 per cent growth  in\r\n\r\ntrade, which represents the difference between  the\r\n\r\n1972  growth rate and the 1966-1970 average  growth\r\n\r\nrate, would have added some 2.7 per cent to our GDP\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate. Continued stagnation, if not decline,\r\n\r\nis   likely  in  the  entrepot  trade.   But   some\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  the  prospects  for  international\r\n\r\ntrade  in  1973 should not be impossible. What  are\r\n\r\nthese prospects?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the recent currency crisis, the economic\r\n\r\noutlook for the major industrialised countries  for\r\n\r\n1973  appeared  bright.  A  forecast  made  by  the\r\n\r\nOrganisation   for   Economic   Co-operation    and\r\n\r\nDevelopment (OECD) indicated that Japan should lead\r\n\r\nthe  group of industrialised countries with a  real\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  for  1973  of  nearly  11  per  cent,\r\n\r\nfollowed  by the United States with 6.25 per  cent,\r\n\r\nFrance and Canada 6 per cent, Germany 5.2 per cent,\r\n\r\nand  Italy and the United Kingdom 5 per cent. These\r\n\r\nare  high  rates of growth compared  with  previous\r\n\r\nyears.  The  recessionary tendencies which  plagued\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions in early 1972  were  therefore\r\n\r\nabsent for 1973 and international trade seemed  due\r\n\r\nfor    a    correspondingly    vigorous    revival.\r\n\r\nConfirmation  that  1973  would  be   unlike   1972\r\n\r\nappeared  in the form of high commodity prices  for\r\n\r\nsugar,  wheat,  and other cereals, and  also  in  a\r\n\r\nsmaller but more important way for South East Asia,\r\n\r\nin rubber, rice and tropical products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the prospects have now become dimmer\r\n\r\nbecause  of possible disruption from parity changes\r\n\r\nand  floats in world trading currencies, it is  not\r\n\r\nunlikely  that the international trading  community\r\n\r\nhas   learnt   how  to  live  with  such   monetary\r\n\r\ndisturbances. Trade will be much less affected than\r\n\r\nwith   the   first   unfamiliar   realignment    of\r\n\r\ncurrencies. For example, trading firms in Japan had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor   some  time  before  the  recent  float   been\r\n\r\naccustomed in their trading commitments to discount\r\n\r\na  10  per cent revaluation of the Yen. They should\r\n\r\nadjust without difficulty to any higher rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Singapore trade, it may be of some\r\n\r\ninterest to note the very mixed effects last year's\r\n\r\ncurrency  realignment  had on Singapore's  external\r\n\r\ntrade during the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revaluation of the Yen affected the size of\r\n\r\nSingapore's imports from Japan because these became\r\n\r\ndearer. On the other hand, the Yen revaluation  did\r\n\r\nnot lead to any increase in Singapore's exports  to\r\n\r\nJapan.  In fact, exports of petroleum products  and\r\n\r\nrubber declined. The reason may be due partly to  a\r\n\r\ndock  strike in Japan which affected trade  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Japan adversely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncertainty of the Pound Sterling resulting\r\n\r\nin its eventual floating retarded Singapore's trade\r\n\r\nwith Britain. The revaluation of the Mark led to  a\r\n\r\nmoderate  increase in trade between  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nWest Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devaluation of the US Dollar resulted in an\r\n\r\nappreciable increase in trade between Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  USA.  Total trade for the first 11  months  of\r\n\r\n1972   increased  by  28.3  per  cent  to  $2,069.2\r\n\r\nmillion. Imports from the USA increased by 20.7 per\r\n\r\ncent while our exports to the United States rose by\r\n\r\n41.5  per  cent due mainly to the export  of  semi-finished  products  back to the  United  States  by\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries  of American companies  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMulti-national companies with their assured markets\r\n\r\ncan   surmount  tariff  and  currency   and   other\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manufacturing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, earnings from manufacturing which now\r\n\r\nconstitute  some 23.5 per cent of our  economy,  as\r\n\r\nmeasured by GDP figures, grew by only 20.1 per cent\r\n\r\nas against 25 per cent in 1971 and 27.5 per cent in\r\n\r\n1970.  The decline gives cause for some concern  as\r\n\r\nto whether it evidences an adverse trend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing investment commitments certainly\r\n\r\nfell from $716 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  1971  to  $252 million last year. This  is  due\r\n\r\npartly  to  the pause in the investment commitments\r\n\r\nof  the  petroleum refining industry which amounted\r\n\r\nto  $285 million in 1971. Investment commitments on\r\n\r\nshipbuilding  and  repairing  yards  also   dropped\r\n\r\nsharply  from  $142.2  million  in  1971  to  $66.9\r\n\r\nmillion   last  year.  Electrical  and   electronic\r\n\r\nproducts,  however, appear to be growth  industries\r\n\r\nof the future, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  new  investment commitments  made  last  year.\r\n\r\nInvestment commitments in low technology industries\r\n\r\ndropped because no incentives are now being offered\r\n\r\nto   such  industries  as  a  result  of  our  more\r\n\r\nselective policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investments obviously require to be further\r\n\r\nstimulated but we would expect that so far  as  the\r\n\r\npetroleum  and transport industries are  concerned,\r\n\r\nwe  can be relatively confident that the decline is\r\n\r\nonly  temporary.  Our  projections  based  on   the\r\n\r\nindustries'   own  figures  are  for  increase   in\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  the  former, to  produce  1,000,000\r\n\r\nbarrels  a day by 1974 or 1975, and in the  latter,\r\n\r\nto  produce by 1975 over $600 million in  value  of\r\n\r\noutput.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these two industries our locational advantage\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to favour maximum development.  The\r\n\r\nfuture  of  Singapore is correlated  to  its  being\r\n\r\nconsidered an ideal offshore manufacturing base for\r\n\r\nmulti-nationals  and  their  subsidiaries.  In  our\r\n\r\noverseas   investment   promotion,   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  (EDB)  will  not  overlook  the\r\n\r\nsmaller but no less important manufacturing  firms.\r\n\r\nTo  encourage them to diversify their activities to\r\n\r\nSingapore, my Ministry will be prepared  to  invest\r\n\r\nequity up to 50 per cent, with the option for  them\r\n\r\nto  buy  back  a  substantial  portion  later.  The\r\n\r\ncriterion  will largely be whether these firms  are\r\n\r\nable  to  make  in  Singapore, technology  products\r\n\r\nwhich have not been made here before. The EDB  will\r\n\r\nidentify  these firms and the Development  Bank  of\r\n\r\nSingapore    Limited   (DBS)   will   manage    our\r\n\r\ninvestments.  A  fund  of  $100  million  will   be\r\n\r\nprovided for this purpose to serve as a catalyst to\r\n\r\nuse  to  best  advantage our  vast  expenditure  on\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the still inadequate supply of\r\n\r\nskilled labour slows down the setting up of  higher\r\n\r\ntechnology  industries.  In  the  interim,   highly\r\n\r\nskilled  foreign  workers  are,  therefore,   being\r\n\r\nadmitted  under our liberal immigration scheme  and\r\n\r\ngranted   permanent  residence  for  the   economic\r\n\r\nbenefit they are likely to bring to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to allocate a large\r\n\r\npart of its resources to technical education. Since\r\n\r\n1962,  and  more  actively  in  recent  years,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  through the Economic Development  Board\r\n\r\nhas  been  engaged in a multiple-programme approach\r\n\r\nto    develop   industrial   training   in   modern\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   skills.  Besides   the   Industrial\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Scholarship Scheme, we  now  have  the\r\n\r\nOverseas  Training  Programme, the  Joint  Training\r\n\r\nProgramme,  the Apprenticeship Training Scheme  and\r\n\r\nthe   Training  Subsidy  Scheme  for  sophisticated\r\n\r\nindustries.  The  essence of all these  schemes  is\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is prepared not only  to  meet\r\n\r\nfully  or  partly  the training  costs  of  workers\r\n\r\nrequired by industries but also to create a poo1 of\r\n\r\nskilled   workers   available   for   future   high\r\n\r\ntechnology industries setting up in Singapore. I am\r\n\r\nglad  to  report  that at least  two  large  multi-national   firms,  which  have  recently   set   up\r\n\r\nsubstantial  operations in  Singapore,  have  taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of the joint training programme to  train\r\n\r\nover 1,000 skilled machinists and toolmakers over a\r\n\r\nperiod  of five years. This number is in excess  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  immediate  requirements.  In  addition,\r\n\r\nnegotiation  is  in  progress with  several  multi-national  firms  to train jointly  an  even  larger\r\n\r\nnumber  of skilled workers. The Government  on  its\r\n\r\npart  has  earmarked  $8.7 million  for  industrial\r\n\r\ntraining for the next financial year. These various\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes,  where  necessary,  would  be\r\n\r\nstreamlined further and modified to take account of\r\n\r\nchanging needs from year to year. Our target is  to\r\n\r\nreduce  our  present dependence on foreign  workers\r\n\r\nfor   growth   to   more  modest   and   manageable\r\n\r\nproportions by 1977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation of nearly full employment, a goal\r\n\r\nof  economic policy must be to upgrade the  quality\r\n\r\nof the work in our enterprises by modernisation and\r\n\r\nexpansion   with  higher  investment  per   worker.\r\n\r\nIndustries  which  do not carry out  investment  of\r\n\r\nmore  capital  per  worker,  change  production  to\r\n\r\nhigher   quality   products   and   improve   their\r\n\r\norganisation, must expect to lose their workers  to\r\n\r\nindustries  which do. Such industries will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to meet their wage increases every year which\r\n\r\nwill  be  recommended by the National Wages Council\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their low productivity.  Our  National\r\n\r\nWages  Council must estimate the effects  of  their\r\n\r\nguidelines  for  last  year's  wage  increase,  and\r\n\r\nconsider  the increase appropriate this year  inter\r\n\r\nalia,  to  achieve this objective and to  induce  a\r\n\r\nstructural  transformation in  our  industrial  and\r\n\r\nother  sectors.  Too  high an  increase  in  wages,\r\n\r\ntaking   productivity  into  account,  will   cause\r\n\r\nunemployment. Too low an increase will increase the\r\n\r\ntightness of our labour market, and starve the flow\r\n\r\no  workers into the higher technology industries we\r\n\r\nwant  either  by  upgrading of present  firms  with\r\n\r\nlower technology, or by new firms from abroad being\r\n\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there is no need to amend existing\r\n\r\nlegislation on tax incentives because these by  and\r\n\r\nlarge  are  adequate, I intend  to  apply  existing\r\n\r\nlegislation to give optimal advantage to industries\r\n\r\nwhich can introduce new technology to Singapore and\r\n\r\nare  willing  to train our workers  in  the  skills\r\n\r\ndemanded.   Training  costs  may  be  regarded   as\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  the same way as  fixed  assets  for\r\n\r\npurposes  of  tax  exemption  periods  for  pioneer\r\n\r\ncompanies.  For industries with high capital  Costs\r\n\r\nand  long  gestation periods, the Government  would\r\n\r\napply  the  provision  of the existing  legislation\r\n\r\nwith  some  flexibility  in  order  to  enable  the\r\n\r\ncompanies to reap fully the benefit of the  pioneer\r\n\r\nstatus granted to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the better performance I expect in\r\n\r\n1973   from  1972's  major  growth  sectors,   i.e.\r\n\r\nconstruction,  tourism, banking and port  activity,\r\n\r\nthe  measures I have outlined should be  sufficient\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffset   any  uncertainties  caused  by   the   new\r\n\r\ninternational currency realignment, and to  restore\r\n\r\nthe  rapid growth rate of Singapore in 1973 to  its\r\n\r\n15 per cent level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Budget</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we come to the Budget for the financial\r\n\r\nyear  1973-74 which I shall hereafter  for  brevity\r\n\r\ncall  FY  1973.  There are certain changes  in  the\r\n\r\npresentation of this Budget which I should like  to\r\n\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my last Budget Statement I emphasised that the\r\n\r\nchanging  needs of the economy in the 1970s  called\r\n\r\nfor  occasional  reappraisal of  the  policies  and\r\n\r\npriorities  of allocation of funds, as  well  as  a\r\n\r\nreview  of  the administrative machinery  including\r\n\r\nthe  present  system of government  budgetting  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  control.  To facilitate  the  appraisal,\r\n\r\naction  has been taken to modify the format of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  so  that the recurrent  and  development\r\n\r\nexpenditures of various Ministries and  departments\r\n\r\ncan be examined in a coherent way. As a first step,\r\n\r\nI  am  presenting the FY 1973 Main and  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  as  a unified whole in one  document.  A\r\n\r\ncommon set of Heads of Expenditure is used for both\r\n\r\ntypes   of  Estimates.  Further,  the  grants   and\r\n\r\ncontributions  in  the  Main Estimates  which  were\r\n\r\npreviously  grouped under one Head  of  Expenditure\r\n\r\nsuch as Contributions and Charitable Allowances are\r\n\r\nnow  distributed to their respective Heads. I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  with these rearrangements Honourable  Members\r\n\r\nwill  have  a clearer and more complete picture  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  under each Head of Expenditure.  I\r\n\r\nshould  add  that  for the FY  1974  Estimates,  my\r\n\r\nofficials   are   exploring  the   possibility   of\r\n\r\nrestructuring subheads with the aim of streamlining\r\n\r\nand rationalising their presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last sitting of this House, I made a\r\n\r\nstatement  on  revision of salaries and  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service in  respect  of  the  upper\r\n\r\nechelons  of  particularly the  administrative  and\r\n\r\nprofessional officers in the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese  changes  are part of the overall  effort  to\r\n\r\nkeep   men   of  quality  and  integrity   in   the\r\n\r\nadministrative machine so that it will be  in  trim\r\n\r\nand  able  to  respond to the increasingly  complex\r\n\r\ndemands  on  the  business  of  Government.  Higher\r\n\r\nrewards, either monetary or otherwise, can only  be\r\n\r\njustified for high performance and efficiency.  The\r\n\r\nover-riding principle of award in the service  will\r\n\r\nremain that of merit. I am confident that the civil\r\n\r\nservice  will continue to maintain its high  degree\r\n\r\nof devotion and integrity and increase its level of\r\n\r\nperformance,  with  more of the  talented  officers\r\n\r\nremaining  in  the Service. The revised  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions  announced  for the  administrative  and\r\n\r\nprofessional officers have not been incorporated in\r\n\r\nthe Budget because they were finalised too late for\r\n\r\nentry,  but Members should bear them in  mind  when\r\n\r\nconsidering the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Mechanisation and improvement in work methods</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in the volume, quality and scope of\r\n\r\nservices provided by the Government sector requires\r\n\r\nan additional 2,154 posts for FY 1973. However, the\r\n\r\nsearch for manpower-saving methods of work has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  in  vain. For example, the use of  mechanical\r\n\r\nroad sweepers made it possible to reduce the daily-rated work force in the Sanitation Services by 198.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  through  a change in  work  methods  at\r\n\r\noffstreet car parks, it was possible to abolish all\r\n\r\nthe  211 vacancies of car park attendant in the Car\r\n\r\nParks  Division.  In  addition, requests  involving\r\n\r\n1,038  positions, mostly of the clerical and daily-rated  grades,  were turned down.  The  departments\r\n\r\nwhich  made  those requests were  either  asked  to\r\n\r\nredeploy   their  existing  establishment   through\r\n\r\nimproved   work  methods  or  given  provision   to\r\n\r\npurchase labour-saving equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Estimates of Expenditure, FY 1973</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Memorandum* (* Paper Misc. 1 of 1973) on the Main and Development Estimates gives the detailed breakdowns of\r\n\r\nexpenditure. I would like to underline briefly  the\r\n\r\nmajor areas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Government endeavour, in providing a  framework\r\n\r\nwithin  which the individual provisions under  each\r\n\r\nHead of Expenditure may be discussed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total outlay for the FY 1973, excluding the\r\n\r\ntransfer   from  the  Consolidated  Fund   to   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund,  is $2,773.6  million.  Of  this\r\n\r\namount $820.6 million or 29.6 per cent is earmarked\r\n\r\nas  loans  to statutory authorities and  industrial\r\n\r\nand  commercial enterprises in which Government has\r\n\r\na  stake.  The  needs of economic development  have\r\n\r\ntherefore  been  fully  taken  care  of.   Of   the\r\n\r\nremaining  $1,953.0 million, Statutory  Expenditure\r\n\r\ntakes  up  $307.4  million.  Defence  and  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  take up another $632.1 million.  This  is\r\n\r\n9.4  per  cent less than the provision for FY  1972\r\n\r\nreflecting the consolidation in the Singapore Armed\r\n\r\nForces after the rapid build-up in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Housing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key area of development is, of course, low-cost housing for the people. Despite the rapid rate\r\n\r\nof  construction of low-cost apartments there is  a\r\n\r\nlong  waiting  list  for  such  accommodation.  The\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board is stepping  up  its\r\n\r\nThird  Five-Year Building Programme (1970-1975)  to\r\n\r\n30,000  units,  a year. To finance this  programme,\r\n\r\nsubstantial loan funds are required and  have  been\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the Estimates for the next  financial\r\n\r\nyear.  Of the total provision of $820.6 million  of\r\n\r\nloan  funds to statutory bodies and commercial  and\r\n\r\nindustrial  enterprises, 5349 million or  42.5  per\r\n\r\ncent goes to the HDB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of low-cost housing estates also\r\n\r\nentails  the  provision of other  basic  facilities\r\n\r\nsuch  as  sewerage,  schools and  post  offices.  A\r\n\r\nnumber  of sewerage schemes for which provision  is\r\n\r\nmade  in  the  FY  1973 Development  Estimates  are\r\n\r\nspecifically  to  meet the requirements  of  public\r\n\r\nhousing  estates. These include the Bedok  Sewerage\r\n\r\nScheme,  Telok  Blangah  Sewerage  Scheme,  Kallang\r\n\r\nBasin  Sewerage  Scheme and the Woodlands  Sewerage\r\n\r\nScheme. With an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreasing proportion of our population residing in\r\n\r\nlarge  public housing estates, it becomes necessary\r\n\r\nto  relocate  schools so that  our  young  students\r\n\r\nresiding  in such estates will not have  to  travel\r\n\r\nlong   distances  between  home  and  school.  This\r\n\r\naccounts  for the substantial increase in provision\r\n\r\nfor  the  building  of  new  schools  in  the  next\r\n\r\nfinancial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Education and industrial training</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of schools is only one aspect of\r\n\r\nthe Government's investment in education. Last year\r\n\r\nI   mentioned  the  revision  of  the   terms   and\r\n\r\nconditions   of  employment  of  various   services\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Education Service.  Following  this\r\n\r\nrevision,  a  major promotion exercise  for  school\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers was launched and is nearing\r\n\r\ncompletion.  It  is hoped that  this  will  give  a\r\n\r\nwelcome  boost  to  the  morale  of  the  efficient\r\n\r\nofficers  and  improve  the  quality  of  teaching.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  shortage  of  manpower  in   schools\r\n\r\npersists. To alleviate the situation, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education has started a scheme whereby teaching\r\n\r\ncadets  are  recruited  to study  at  the  proposed\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education and, in between, take  on  a\r\n\r\nteaching  load in schools as a means  of  acquiring\r\n\r\npractical  experience.  Eventually,  it  should  be\r\n\r\npossible  to cut down on the use of relief teachers\r\n\r\nand  achieve  a  more uniform level  of  competence\r\n\r\namongst teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantial sums are provided for the development\r\n\r\nof new campuses for the University of Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Polytechnic. For works and buildings\r\n\r\nin  FY  1973  it  is estimated that the  University\r\n\r\ncampus  at Kent Ridge will require $12 million  and\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic Campus at Dover Road $2.5 million.\r\n\r\nAs  I said earlier, an increasing supply of skilled\r\n\r\nindustrial  workers  is  required  to  sustain  and\r\n\r\naccelerate   industrial  growth.   The   Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining Board will play a major role in this area.\r\n\r\nNot  only  will training at vocational institutions\r\n\r\nneed   to  be  expanded  and  upgraded  but  proper\r\n\r\napprenticeship  and trade-testing  programmes  will\r\n\r\nhave to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplanned  and  implemented. A substantial  grant  is\r\n\r\nprovided  to start the Board on a sound  basis.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  as  I  have mentioned  elsewhere,\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  participate  in   joint-training\r\n\r\nschemes with well-established industries which have\r\n\r\nthe  know-how. A total of $8.7 million is  provided\r\n\r\nin  the  Estimates  for the recurrent  and  capital\r\n\r\ncosts of such schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Environment</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, industrialisation and urbanisation\r\n\r\ncan affect our environment adversely. Experience in\r\n\r\nsome  industrially-advanced  countries  shows  that\r\n\r\nunless  parallel action is taken to  safeguard  the\r\n\r\nquality     of    the    environment    even     as\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and urbanisation take place, anti-pollution  action will be an uphill  task.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of Singapore, the smallness of our land  area\r\n\r\nmakes  avoidance  of  this  problem  all  the  more\r\n\r\nurgent.  With the establishment of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment, greater attention can be directed\r\n\r\ntowards this problem and measures to combat it  can\r\n\r\nbe better co-ordinated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major anti-pollution programme undertaken by\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of the Environment is the resiting  of\r\n\r\nhawkers  from backlanes and side streets to  proper\r\n\r\nmarkets  and hawkers centres so that proper  health\r\n\r\nstandards  and  cleanliness  of  hawkers   can   be\r\n\r\nenforced.   This   accounts  for  the   substantial\r\n\r\nallocation  for  the construction of  market/hawker\r\n\r\ncentres  and  the traditional number of enforcement\r\n\r\npersonnel for the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limited land area in Singapore is again\r\n\r\nevident when we think of the great volume of refuse\r\n\r\nthat  has  to  be disposed of each day,  using  the\r\n\r\nexisting method of dumping. The construction of  an\r\n\r\nincinerator  and a compaction plant will  no  doubt\r\n\r\nhelp  alleviate  this problem.  For  these,  it  is\r\n\r\nestimated that $1.20 million will be required in FY\r\n\r\n1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Health</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we may expect preventive measures against\r\n\r\nall  sorts  of pollution to result generally  in  a\r\n\r\nhealthier people,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe   know   that  there  will  always  be  patients\r\n\r\nrequiring  diagnostic and treatment facilities.  In\r\n\r\nFY  1973,  additional provision has  been  made  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  and  improve  such  facilities  on  two\r\n\r\nfronts.  First,  the medical specialities,  namely,\r\n\r\nNephrology,  Plastic  and  Reconstructive  Surgery,\r\n\r\nNeuro-Surgery  and  Cardio-Thoracic  Surgery   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be developed. Some 130 new  posts  are\r\n\r\nprovided  for these. Secondly, hospital  facilities\r\n\r\nwill  be extended. A small hospital will be  opened\r\n\r\nat  Changi,  whilst  the  Alexandra  and  Sembawang\r\n\r\nHospitals  which were taken over from  the  British\r\n\r\nArmed Forces will be developed further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 1973, the total outlay for the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth including the Hospitals Division is 12.4 per\r\n\r\ncent   of  the  total  allocation  for  the  Social\r\n\r\nServices sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue Estimates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is the Government expenditure to be financed?\r\n\r\nDetails of the Revenue Estimates are given  in  the\r\n\r\nsupplementary Memorandum* (*Paper Misc. 1 of 1973) to the Estimates. I  need to give only a brief overall picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 1973, revenue is estimated at $1,874.9\r\n\r\nmillion.  This  represents an  increase  of  $199.7\r\n\r\nmillion or 11.9 per cent over the revised estimates\r\n\r\nof $1,675.2 million for FY 1972. If the residual of\r\n\r\n$45.8  million  from  the former  Currency  Board's\r\n\r\nassets  is excluded from the revenue for  FY  1972,\r\n\r\nthe  revenue  estimates for FY 1973 show  a  growth\r\n\r\nrate of 15.1 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 1973, income tax and payroll tax are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  yield $554.0 million  which  is  $110\r\n\r\nmillion  or  24.8  per cent more than  the  revised\r\n\r\nestimates  of  $444.0  million  for  FY  1972.  The\r\n\r\nhealthy  performance of income  and  payroll  taxes\r\n\r\nreflects the growth in the economy with nearly full\r\n\r\nemployment, with most individuals earning more  and\r\n\r\nwith   most  companies  maintaining  their   profit\r\n\r\nmargins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from property tax is expected to be $190\r\n\r\nmillion  during  FY  1973 as  against  the  revised\r\n\r\nrevenue of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$166 million. The high growth of this item reflects\r\n\r\nthe  robust  growth of the construction sector  and\r\n\r\nhigher rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue from indirect taxes and taxes on outlay\r\n\r\nin  FY  1973  is  expected to yield $545.0  million\r\n\r\nwhich  represents an increase of $71.0  million  or\r\n\r\n15.0  per cent over revised estimates for FY  1972.\r\n\r\nThis  substantial increase is partly due to  normal\r\n\r\ngrowth   and  partly  due  to  the  tax   revisions\r\n\r\nintroduced in October last year. The main increases\r\n\r\nare   expected  from  customs  duties  on  liquors,\r\n\r\ntobacco and petroleum products, other import duties\r\n\r\nand taxes on motor vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-tax items are an important source of revenue;\r\n\r\ncollectively,  they contribute  $570.7  million  or\r\n\r\n30.4 per cent of the total estimated revenue for FY\r\n\r\n1973. Included under this category are the revenues\r\n\r\nfrom  sales  of  goods and services  of  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments,  land sales, investment of  Government\r\n\r\nassets    and    currency   surplus    and    other\r\n\r\nadministrative  fees. The main increases  would  be\r\n\r\nfrom  land sales and sales of urban renewal  sites,\r\n\r\nwhich   together  are  expected  to  yield   $102.0\r\n\r\nmillion,  due  to  more land being  leased  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board,  the  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  and the private sector for development\r\n\r\npurposes.  The  Special Aid of \ufffd50.0  million  from\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom will be fully disbursed by the  end\r\n\r\nof  1973.  The decline in revenue from Special  Aid\r\n\r\nwill,   however,  be  compensated  by   anticipated\r\n\r\nincrease  in  earnings  from  Government  financial\r\n\r\ninvestments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Policy and Changes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the tax measures I propose for this\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stated in the past that so long as the\r\n\r\neconomy  continues its robust rate  of  growth,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  unnecessary to impose  major  or  painful\r\n\r\nincreases  in  tax rates although changes  in  such\r\n\r\nrates and additional taxation may from time to time\r\n\r\nbe  necessary  or  desirable to  effect  social  or\r\n\r\neconomic policies. Members, who are aware  of  this\r\n\r\nprinciple and who have looked at the balance of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevenue  and expenditure in the Main Estimates  and\r\n\r\nnoted  the modest surplus of over $20 million which\r\n\r\nhas  been planned, will no doubt have already  come\r\n\r\nto  the conclusion that to provide sufficient funds\r\n\r\nto  meet the current as well as part of development\r\n\r\nneeds of Government there is little or no need  for\r\n\r\nadditional taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to be able to confirm them in this\r\n\r\nconclusion. In fact, the only changes I propose  to\r\n\r\nmake  are  in  connection with  the  grant  of  the\r\n\r\nfollowing tax exemptions or tax reliefs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(a)  Tax Relief for Taxpayers who support Dependent Parents and Grandparents</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, many Members suggested that reliefs\r\n\r\nshould be given for the maintenance of aged parents\r\n\r\nand  handicapped children on the grounds  that  the\r\n\r\nEastern  concept  of filial piety  requires,  among\r\n\r\nother things, that children should look after their\r\n\r\nparents  in old age. I recognise that with  greater\r\n\r\nurbanisation  and  more limited living  space,  the\r\n\r\nAsian family unit is threatened with disintegration\r\n\r\nand that aged parents may be left on their own when\r\n\r\nthey  most  need care and attention. I am therefore\r\n\r\nprepared   to   give   some  tax   relief   as   an\r\n\r\nencouragement  to  taxpayers who look  after  their\r\n\r\nparents  and  grandparents where they  are  without\r\n\r\nwork or income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1-1-74 a taxpayer may claim a\r\n\r\ntax deduction from his income of $300 per dependent\r\n\r\nparent or grandparent. A taxpayer may claim up to a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  two dependent parents or grandparents,\r\n\r\nwho  are over 55 years of age, are supported by the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer and are staying in the same household.  If\r\n\r\na   parent   is  below  55  years  but  handicapped\r\n\r\nphysically  or mentally, he will also  qualify  for\r\n\r\ntax relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(b)   Tax   Relief   for  Taxpayers   who   support Handicapped Children</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the deductions allowed from\r\n\r\nassessable income in respect of children cease  for\r\n\r\nthose over 16 years old. This is so even when  they\r\n\r\nare physically or mentally handicapped children who\r\n\r\ndo not earn any income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand who continue to depend on their parents. As  it\r\n\r\nis  fair that taxpayers should get some tax  relief\r\n\r\nfor  supporting such children, I propose to provide\r\n\r\nthat  with  effect from 1-1-74 taxpayers can  claim\r\n\r\nallowance  for  handicapped children although  they\r\n\r\nare over 16 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(c)   Income   Tax   Relief  for   Provident   Fund   Contributions  and  Premium  on  Life   insurance   Policies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Income Tax Act, an individual is\r\n\r\nallowed   to   deduct   from   assessable    income\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  approved  provident  funds   and\r\n\r\npremiums on life insurance subject to a maximum  of\r\n\r\none-sixth of assessable income or $4,000, whichever\r\n\r\nis the less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in compulsory CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions, it has been found that the one-sixth\r\n\r\nof  assessable income limit has become restrictive,\r\n\r\nparticularly  for  the lower middle  income  group.\r\n\r\nWith the compulsory CPF contribution rate at 12 per\r\n\r\ncent,  there  would  be  left  for  deduction  from\r\n\r\nassessable income only 4.67 per cent of his  income\r\n\r\nfrom  the  amount  paid for other approved  private\r\n\r\nprovident  fund  contributions and  life  insurance\r\n\r\npremiums.  I propose therefore to remove the  limit\r\n\r\nof  one-sixth of assessable income with effect from\r\n\r\n1-1-73.  The  limit  of $4,000  will  remain.  This\r\n\r\nmeasure  should encourage the public to  save  more\r\n\r\neither  in private approved provident funds  or  in\r\n\r\nlife   insurance  policies,  in   line   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy of encouraging savings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(d)  Reduction  of  Stamp  Duty  on  Marine  Hull Insurance Policies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, sea insurance policies are subject to\r\n\r\nstamp  duty  at a flat rate of 50 cents per  policy\r\n\r\nexcept  for  hull  insurance  policies  which   are\r\n\r\nsubject to ad valorem rates of 20 cents per  $1,000\r\n\r\ninsured  if  the insurance is for less  than  three\r\n\r\nmonths;  30  cents  per $1,000  if  the  policy  is\r\n\r\nbetween three to six months and 50 cents per $1,000\r\n\r\nif  the  policy is between six to 12  months.  Hull\r\n\r\ninsurance on a fleet of any substance will run into\r\n\r\nlarge sums and an ad valorem stamp duty can be very\r\n\r\nsubstantial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  insurance companies are  handicapped  by\r\n\r\nthe  high  rate  of stamp duty here in  competition\r\n\r\nagainst  London insurance companies  which  do  not\r\n\r\nhave to pay stamp duties on sea insurance policies.\r\n\r\nTo  promote  Singapore's development as a  maritime\r\r\n\r\ncentre  able  to  provide essential facilities  and\r\n\r\nservices  including  sea  insurance  at  reasonable\r\n\r\ncost,  I  propose to replace the ad  valorem  stamp\r\n\r\nduty by a flat rate stamp duty of $1 per policy for\r\n\r\nall  sea insurance policies. This new rate of stamp\r\n\r\nduty will be implemented with immediate effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(e)  Exemption from Stamp Duty of Promissory  Notes issued by Customers to Banks</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my last Budget Statement, I announced the\r\n\r\nabolition  of stamp duty on Negotiable Certificates\r\n\r\nof   Deposits   (NCDs),  bills  of   exchange   and\r\n\r\npromissory  notes transacted from or through  banks\r\n\r\nto  promote  money  market activities.  It  is  now\r\n\r\nproposed  to extend this exemption from stamp  duty\r\n\r\nalso  to  promissory notes issued by  customers  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  banks. This is to increase the  variety\r\n\r\nand  availability  of  money  instruments  and   to\r\n\r\npromote greater sophistication of our money market.\r\n\r\nThis exemption will come into effect immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(f) Non-collection of Withholding Tax on Negotiable  Certificates of Deposit in Local Currency</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not, strictly, represent a tax\r\n\r\nconcession,  but  I  have  included  it  here   for\r\n\r\ncompleteness.  If withholding tax on interest  were\r\n\r\ncollected  at  source,  the  introduction  of   the\r\n\r\nNegotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCDs) in  local\r\n\r\ncurrency would not be possible as the marketability\r\n\r\nof  this  instrument  would be affected.  The  NCDs\r\n\r\ncould play an important role in the development  of\r\n\r\nthe  money market and would be welcomed by both the\r\n\r\nfinancial   sector  and  corporate  investors.   By\r\n\r\npurchasing  NCDs,  investors  would  be   able   to\r\n\r\nmaintain  liquidity  and, at the  same  time,  earn\r\n\r\nincome.  The NCDs will therefore be attractive  for\r\n\r\ndiscount\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouse business. The Monetary Authority of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill allow financial institutions to issue NCDs  in\r\n\r\nthe local currency, with effect from 1-4-73, on the\r\n\r\nfollowing conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The issuing banks and discount houses will\r\n\r\nkeep  records  of purchasers  and  sellers  of     NCDs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The taxable income will be taken as the\r\n\r\ndifference  between  the  sale  and   purchase\r\n\r\nprice of the NCDs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The NCDs will have to be deposited with an\r\n\r\nauthorised depository.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The issue of NCDs will be subject to Exchange Control Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(g)  Exemption  of income Tax to Crew  employed  on  Singapore Registered Ships</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1969, the Singapore Registry of Ships\r\n\r\nwas  opened to foreign vessels. In order to attract\r\n\r\nsuch  vessels,  the  initial registration  fee  was\r\n\r\nlowered to $2.50 per net ton and the annual tonnage\r\n\r\nfee  was  reduced  to  20 cents  per  net  ton.  An\r\n\r\nundertaking  was also given that these  fees  could\r\n\r\nnot  be increased for a period of 20 years from the\r\n\r\ndate  of  the  initial registration of  the  ships.\r\n\r\nFurther,  when  a  ship is sold to  another  person\r\n\r\nwithout  a change of flag of the ship, the  initial\r\n\r\nregistration fee would be further reduced to 50 per\r\n\r\ncent of the fee subject to a minimum of $1,250  and\r\n\r\na maximum of $6,000. A refund of 50 per cent of the\r\n\r\nannual tonnage fee would be granted if at least  25\r\n\r\nper  cent  of  the  crew  are  Singapore  citizens.\r\n\r\nShipowners, who wish to transfer the ships  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  flag, need not have them  resurveyed  if\r\n\r\nthe ships possess valid certificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, income tax has been exempted on the\r\n\r\nprofits derived by a Singapore registered ship with\r\n\r\neffect  from  1-1-69.  These incentives  have  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful in attracting foreign ships to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In January 1969, there were  357  ships\r\n\r\nwith  a total of 252,940 gross tons. Now the number\r\n\r\nof  ships is 782 with a total gross tonnage of 1.75\r\n\r\nmillion gross tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance Singapore's status as one of the\r\n\r\nbusiest ports in the world, it is felt that further\r\n\r\nimpetus  must be given to the registration of  more\r\n\r\nships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from direct employment, the registration of\r\n\r\nmore  ships  in Singapore is likely to bring  other\r\n\r\nbenefits   such  as  from  bunkering  and  repairs.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is proposed to give exemption  from\r\n\r\nincome  tax to crew working on Singapore registered\r\n\r\nships  with  effect  from  1-1-74  (based  on  1973\r\n\r\nearnings).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of revenue resulting from all these tax\r\n\r\nexemptions   is   estimated  at  approximately   $2\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the financial policy which I\r\n\r\nhave   outlined   in  this  Budget  Statement   has\r\n\r\nnecessarily   laid   stress  upon   public   sector\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  expenditures.  But   I   am   very\r\n\r\nconscious  that  the  success  of  any  policy   in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  and furthering progress  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill depend also upon the private sector, upon  not\r\n\r\nonly  the  response  but  also  the  effective  co-operation  of  both workers and employers  in  such\r\n\r\nsector.  It  is important that we seek to  maintain\r\n\r\nthe  present  very  healthy climate  in  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  in  Singapore. Harmony  between  unions,\r\n\r\nemployers  and  the  Government  has  been  clearly\r\n\r\nevident in many fields of coordinated activity, for\r\n\r\nexample,  in  improving labour productivity  or  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining the highest quality in our products. In\r\n\r\nthe  National  Wages  Council  also,  it  has  been\r\n\r\nheartening   that   despite   strongly    competing\r\n\r\ninterests,  our  unions  and  employers  could   so\r\n\r\nreadily  come to agreement last year upon how  much\r\n\r\nof  the  growth of wealth in the Singapore  economy\r\n\r\nshould  be  distributed in the form  of  percentage\r\n\r\nwage  increases, and how much accordingly  retained\r\n\r\nfor   further  growth  in  business.  It   is   not\r\n\r\nunreasonable    to   expect    that    for    1973,\r\n\r\nrecommendations  for another equitable  sharing  of\r\n\r\nrise in national income will again be agreed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an effective development plan, and assured\r\n\r\ncollaboration from management and workers, I  think\r\n\r\nthat  we  may  face  1973 with some  confidence  in\r\n\r\nachieving a very rapid growth rate, perhaps at  our\r\n\r\ntargeted figure of 15 per cent per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That Parliament\r\n\r\napproves the financial policy of the Government for\r\n\r\nthe  financial year 1st April, 1973 to 31st  March,\r\n\r\n1974.\" In accordance with paragraph (1) of Standing\r\n\r\nOrder No. 84, the debate now stands adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hon, debate to be resumed on what day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> On 8th March, 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Wednesday, 7th March, 1973.\"- [Mr E.
