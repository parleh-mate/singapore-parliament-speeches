If an unsuspecting person went  to\r\n\r\nsuch  an  insurance company and took out an insurance\r\n\r\npolicy on a car, he would naturally be uninsured; and\r\n\r\nif  he should meet with an accident on a policy which\r\n\r\nhe  thinks  is  valid, then he would  be  in  serious\r\n\r\ntrouble.  I  do  not  notice any  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which  will  penalise  such  an  insurance\r\n\r\ncompany  where, after it has been struck out  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister, it effects an insurance policy on a car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these subsections are\r\n\r\nactually  taken  from the Federation's  Road  Traffic\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1958.

The Court had a clerk\r\n\r\nlent from the Land Office and an office boy lent from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Home Affairs. The first  step  taken\r\n\r\nwas  to provide the Court with an adequate staff. The\r\n\r\nShariah  Court  now  has, besides  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nMuslim Marriages, its own General Clerical Officer, a\r\n\r\nGeneral  Clerical  Assistant, a  Process  Server  and\r\n\r\nNotice Server, a typist and an office boy.

It had no power to punish for contempt in the\r\n\r\nface of the Court, nor had it power to issue warrants\r\n\r\nfor  arrest to persons who failed to comply with  any\r\n\r\nsummons   issued  by  it.  It  had  a  very   limited\r\n\r\njurisdiction. For example, it had only powers to make\r\n\r\norders for maintenance up to $100 a month. Even  when\r\n\r\nit  had jurisdiction and had made an order, it had no\r\n\r\npower  itself to enforce compliance with the  order.\r\n\r\nThis Bill, therefore, seeks to increase the powers of\r\n\r\nthe Shariah Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 and 11 of the Bill give powers to the\r\n\r\nShariah Court to make orders for maintenance and  for\r\n\r\nthe  payments of rnas-kahwin or dowry and consolatory\r\n\r\ngifts  and  also power to enforce the orders  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  manner as fines may be livied in a Magistrate's\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill gives power to the Shariah\r\n\r\nCourt  to  summon witnesses and to issue warrants  of\r\n\r\narrest to persons who fail to attend after being duly\r\n\r\nsummoned,  and  also to exercise the  powers  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt  under Chapter XXXII of the Criminal  Procedure\r\n\r\nCode to punish contempts in the face of the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill gives power to the Shariah\r\n\r\nCourt  to  hear  all appeals from  the  decisions  of\r\n\r\nKathis instead of, as formerly, only from refusals to\r\n\r\nregister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shariah Court has, to some extent, succeeded in\r\n\r\ngiving  greater  stability  to  Muslim  marriages  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, as shown by a Table which I have caused to\r\n\r\nbe  prepared of marriages and divorces in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nFor 1957, the Shariah Court performed 2,303 marriages\r\n\r\nand  divorced  1,192  persons, and  in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nrevocation (rojo) there were 183 persons involved. In\r\n\r\n1958,   2,332  persons  were  married,   1,149   were\r\n\r\ndivorced,  and there were 156 cases of revocation  of\r\n\r\ndivorce.  The  figures for 1959 are  also  available:\r\n\r\nMarriages  were  reduced  to  1,953,  divorces   were\r\n\r\nreduced to 719, and revocations of divorce were  also\r\n\r\nreduced to 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some success has been achieved, it is felt\r\n\r\nthat more can be done. Clause 9 of the Bill provides,\r\n\r\ntherefore  that the Court should appoint arbitrators\r\n\r\nin   all   cases  coming  before  it  and  that   the\r\n\r\narbitrators    should   endeavour   to    effect    a\r\n\r\nreconciliation between the parties. In this  respect,\r\n\r\nthe arbitrators will, it is hoped, be assisted by the\r\n\r\nMuslim  Social  Case  Worker who will  be  appointed.\r\n\r\nPower  is  also given to the Court in  clause  10  to\r\n\r\norder  the  payment of a consolatory  gift  in  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  a divorce is unreasonably insisted on  by  the\r\n\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks in clause 3\r\n\r\nto impose some control on the solemnisation of Muslim\r\n\r\nmarriages  by  providing that where the  man, to  be\r\n\r\nmarried  has  already  a wife or  wives  living,  the\r\n\r\nmarriage  may only be solemnised by the Chief  Kathi,\r\n\r\nwho  shall  satisfy himself that there are no  lawful\r\n\r\nobstacles  according  to the Law  of  Islam  to  such\r\n\r\nmarriage.

Indeed,  the\r\n\r\ntime has come when we should give full powers to  the\r\n\r\nShariah  Court  to  implement its  administration  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with Muslim law. Sir, I  pay  my  highest\r\n\r\ntribute to the Government for putting up this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are many matters which I think should\r\n\r\nbe placed before this House in connection with clause\r\n\r\n3,  where powers to solemnise the marriage of  a  man\r\n\r\nwho already has a wife or wives living, are given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Kathi. I think this power is very wide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the  question  of giving it only to the  Chief  Kathi\r\n\r\nshould be reconsidered by the Government because,  in\r\n\r\nthe opinion of my colleagues in U.M.N.O. and also  in\r\n\r\nmy  opinion, this power should be vested not only  in\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Kathi but also in all the other Kathis  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  For instance, if the Chief Kathi  himself\r\n\r\nwants  to  have more than one wife, who is  going  to\r\n\r\nsolemnise  the marriage? But a bigger problem  arises\r\n\r\nwhen  a  person who already has a wife  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ngoes to Johore Bahru and gets married there. What  is\r\n\r\nthe  purpose then of having the Muslims Ordinance  if\r\n\r\nwe  cannot control the citizens of Singapore who  can\r\n\r\nmarry  and  re-marry  here? And if  the  Chief  Kathi\r\n\r\nforbids a person from marrying here, that person will\r\n\r\nmarry  elsewhere. This is a problem  which  we  would\r\n\r\nlike to place before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to refer to the Muslims Ordinance,\r\n\r\n1957,  in  which this House gave powers only  to  the\r\n\r\nChief Kathi to solemnise marriages of girls who  have\r\n\r\nno guardians. This must also be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I appeal to the Government, particularly\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Labour and Law, to  bring  this\r\n\r\nBill  before a Select Committee so that these clauses\r\n\r\ncan  be further considered. As has been explained  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Labour and Law, I  know  that  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  Advisory  Board  and  the  All-Malaya  Muslim\r\n\r\nMissionary  Society have consented  and  given  their\r\n\r\napproval  to the amendments, but I do feel that  this\r\n\r\nis  a  big  issue affecting the lives  of  people  of\r\n\r\nIslamic  faith in Singapore. Under the circumstances,\r\n\r\nI  appeal to the Government to refer this Bill  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee for further consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir,  in  a  review  of  the  Muslims\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  amendments  have  been  put  up  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  should adopt a certain  attitude  in\r\n\r\nmatters  affecting people of Islamic faith. The  Bill\r\n\r\nis  very  wide  in  scope, and does  not  cover  only\r\n\r\nmarriage and divorce. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  steps we are taking to review the  Muslims\r\n\r\nOrdinance should receive very careful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsideration. I am not opposed to wider powers being\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the Shariah Court. The Minister  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  formerly  marriage  was  considered  to  be   a\r\n\r\nplaything. This Bill will have an adverse effect  not\r\n\r\nonly  on the Muslim community in particular, but also\r\n\r\non the citizens of Singapore as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of giving powers to the Chief Kathi\r\n\r\nalone - it  was  brought up by the Member  for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai - I think the powers should not be given only  to\r\n\r\nthe   Chief  Kathi  with  the  object  of  preventing\r\n\r\nunscrupulous persons from marrying two or more wives.\r\n\r\nOrdinary marriages can be solemnised by other Kathis,\r\n\r\nsay,  by  the  Vice-Kathi. We should  also  give  the\r\n\r\nordinary  Kathis  powers to enable  them  to  conduct\r\n\r\ninquiries  in  the  same  way as  investigations  are\r\n\r\ncarried out into the lives of persons who have  wives\r\n\r\nand  who wish to marry again. I cannot see any reason\r\n\r\nwhy  the Chief Kathi alone should be given the powers\r\n\r\nas,   in   fact,  the  other  Kathis  are   similarly\r\n\r\nresponsible for solemnising marriages in Singapore. I\r\n\r\nam  personally of the opinion that if only the  Chief\r\n\r\nKathi  is  given such powers we will not achieve  the\r\n\r\ndesired  objectives.  As  I  said  earlier  on,   the\r\n\r\nordinary  Kathis should also be given special  powers\r\n\r\nto   carry   out  investigations  before  solemnising\r\n\r\nmarriages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another point I wish to raise. If the\r\n\r\nChief Kathi alone is so empowered, it would mean that\r\n\r\nhe  would  have to carry out investigations based  on\r\n\r\ninformation   obtained  from  other  people,   before\r\n\r\nsolemnising a marriage. Now, if a man lives far  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  City, say, in one of the Southern Islands,\r\n\r\nsurely  the  Chief  Kathi  could  not  solemnise  his\r\n\r\nmarriage on the recommendation of the penghulu alone.\r\n\r\nIf  a  person  lives in Changi or in  a  far  distant\r\n\r\nkampong where contact or communication with the Chief\r\n\r\nKathi  is  difficult, it is natural for those  people\r\n\r\nwho  live  in  that kampong to know all  the  details\r\n\r\nabout  a  person who: wishes to marry again. Now,  if\r\n\r\nthe  powers  are given to the Chief Kathi  alone,  he\r\n\r\nwill be unable to conduct a very careful study of the\r\n\r\nmatter.  Therefore, powers should  be  given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the other  Kathis  as  well who can carry  out  a  better\r\n\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I think it is proper that this\r\n\r\nBill should be referred to a Select Committee so that\r\n\r\nan opportunity could be given to the public to put up\r\n\r\nconstructive    suggestions    for     the     better\r\n\r\nimplementation of the Muslim law in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to make is that many people in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  who  claim to be Muslims,  have  remarked\r\n\r\nthat this Bill is very deleterious to the position of\r\n\r\nIslam in Singapore because no power is vested in  the\r\n\r\nShariah  Court in the case of non-Muslims who cohabit\r\n\r\nwith   Muslim   women.  Therefore,  if  the   Muslims\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill is referred to a Select  Committee,\r\n\r\nmore opportunity will be given to review it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Government\r\n\r\nwhich believes in practising democracy, I wish to say\r\n\r\nthat  the Government will not be unwilling to  accept\r\n\r\nthe suggestion by the Opposition to refer the Muslims\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill to a Select Committee  for  further\r\n\r\nconsideration. However, before doing  that,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to put forward my views. On the question of  the\r\n\r\npowers  of the Chief Kathi to solemnise the  marriage\r\n\r\nof  a  person  who already has a wife or  more  wives\r\n\r\nliving.  From the point of view of Muslim law,  Islam\r\n\r\ndoes not encourage a man marrying more than one wife.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it warns Muslims who wish to marry\r\n\r\nmore  than one wife but who are unable to afford  it.\r\n\r\nIn  the interests of justice, a man should not  marry\r\n\r\nmore  than one wife. If the power is vested  only  in\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Kathi, the question of marrying more  than\r\n\r\none  wife,  from  the point of view  of  the  Islamic\r\n\r\npeople,    can   be   controlled,   thus   preventing\r\n\r\nunscrupulous persons from marrying more than one wife\r\n\r\nand,  after three months, divorcing their  wives.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be that between them, the wives will be able  to\r\n\r\npull their husband's ears! If we invest powers in the\r\n\r\nChief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKathi  only, those Muslims who can afford to maintain\r\n\r\nmore than one wife will marry more than one wife.  If\r\n\r\nwe give this power to the ordinary Kathis, who I know\r\n\r\nare not paid-their income comes only from solemnising\r\n\r\nmarriages-it will mean that investigations  into  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a person who wishes to marry more than  one\r\n\r\nwife  will only be carried out just for the  sake  of\r\n\r\ninvestigation, because if there is no marriage,  then\r\n\r\nthe  Kathi  will have no income. If the Chief  Kathi,\r\n\r\nwho  is  paid  by the Government, has  these  special\r\n\r\npowers, he will be responsible to the Government  for\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  his functions effectively,  and  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  confident that this will mean a  reduction  in\r\n\r\npolygamous  marriages. If a man  cannot  get  married\r\n\r\nhere  and  he goes to Johore, it is not our  problem.\r\n\r\nThere  may be people who wish to go to Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nmarry there; or go to India or Egypt for that matter.\r\n\r\nIt  is not our business. But what matters is that  we\r\n\r\nwant an Ordinance in Singapore so that there will  be\r\n\r\nless  domestic conflicts between the many wives as  a\r\n\r\nresult    of    the   Kathis   not   making    proper\r\n\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning guardians. This power\r\n\r\nis  also given to the Chief Kathi who is paid by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. I have read in the newspapers lately that\r\n\r\na youth eloped with a spinster from Johore. They came\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  to  get married. The parents  of  this\r\n\r\ncouple would ask the Kathi for an explanation. Such a\r\n\r\nmarriage is possible nowadays because this is an  era\r\n\r\nwhere people mix freely. If we give this power to the\r\n\r\nordinary  Kathis who are not paid by  the  Government\r\n\r\nand  who  depend  solely  on  the  solemnisation   of\r\n\r\nmarriages  for  their income, it will  mean  that  no\r\n\r\nproper investigations will be carried out. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwith  the  introduction  of  this  Bill,  I  think  a\r\n\r\nmarriage without the sanction or the knowledge of the\r\n\r\nparents  can  be controlled completely. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nconcerning the legal guardian, shall I say this is an\r\n\r\neasy  matter,  because  I know  if  people  from  the\r\n\r\nkampong  wish to marry, they will send for  a  Kathi.\r\n\r\nThey  pay  a  marriage  fee of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$15,  apart  from  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  transport to fetch a  Kathi  say,  from\r\n\r\nKampong Java to Changi. I think it will be better  if\r\n\r\nthe  bride  and  bridegroom will go in  one  car  and\r\n\r\nproceed  to  the  office  of the  Chief  Kathi,  thus\r\n\r\nreducing a lot of expenses; and it is up to  both  of\r\n\r\nthem  to decide what kind of wedding feast they  wish\r\n\r\nto  have. So, Mr Speaker, this legislation which  we\r\n\r\nare   going  to  enforce  is  good.  However,  as   a\r\n\r\nGovernment which believes in and practises democracy,\r\n\r\nwe will not be unwilling to accept the proposition by\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Members to refer the Bill to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, so that every community in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  offer  their views to  the  Government,\r\n\r\nparticularly Islamic people, as this particular  Bill\r\n\r\naffects them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Aiwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am a Malay and of Islamic\r\n\r\nfaith.  I have heard that the Government will not  be\r\n\r\nunwilling   to  agree  to  the  suggestion   by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  refer the Bill  back  to  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. This is a good thing. But, Mr Speaker,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to clarify one point. As far as  I  know,\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development has emphasised  the problem  of\r\n\r\nmarrying one wife or more than one wife, and that the\r\n\r\nKathi  is only a witness. There are many Muslims  who\r\n\r\nknow  about  this. As an example, Ali has a  daughter\r\n\r\nand  Inche Yaacob asks for her hand. Inche Yaacob has\r\n\r\nalready  got a wife. Ali is very pleased and is  very\r\n\r\nwilling  to accept Inche Yaacob as his son-in-law.  I\r\n\r\nam  quite  sure Ali will accept Inche Yaacob  because\r\n\r\nthe  Muslims Ordinance permits Inche Yaacob to  marry\r\n\r\nAli's  daughter, although he has already got a  wife.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the Kathi, whether it is the Chief  Kathi\r\n\r\nor  an ordinary Kathi, merely witnesses the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe  marriage is conducted according to Muslim rites.\r\n\r\nIf  I  am  wrong, please ask the Muslims who  are  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kathi is merely a witness to the marriage to\r\n\r\nensure  that it will not be in contradiction  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  law. Under these circumstances, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. is  of  the opinion that if the  Government\r\n\r\nagrees  to  this Bill to be further reconsidered,  it\r\n\r\nwill receive many reports and views on the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have followed the newspapers from day to day, particularly the local newspapers. As far\r\n\r\nas  Muslim  law is concerned, this Bill is  different\r\n\r\nfrom  the  one  which was approved  by  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  power in connection  with  monogamous\r\n\r\nmarriages. I would like to know whether the staff  of\r\n\r\nthe   Sharjah  Court  can  make  statements  in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers as to their views on Bills which have  not\r\n\r\nalready  been approved by this Assembly? Can  it  be\r\n\r\ndone  by the staff of the Shariah Court, who are paid\r\n\r\nservants of the Government? Are they involved  in  or\r\n\r\nconnected  with  other matters? It  is  a  difficulty\r\n\r\nwhich I myself cannot clarify here. It is left to the\r\n\r\nGovernment to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand, Mr Speaker, as explained by the\r\n\r\nState  Advocate-General in the newspapers,  that  the\r\n\r\nChief  Kathi  is  paid  for his  work  and  that  all\r\n\r\npayments  are returned to the Government. I  wish  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  here that the Islamic faith believes  that\r\n\r\nall  men are the same. If we are industrious, we will\r\n\r\nbe  rich.  God  is almighty and just, and  we  cannot\r\n\r\novercome  the  powers of God. If we allow  the  Chief\r\n\r\nKathi to solemnise such marriages, there may be times\r\n\r\nwhen - as  I  have  said, the Chief Kathi  is  just  an\r\n\r\nordinary human being - he may not be in the mood and he\r\n\r\nwill  reject the request to solemnise such marriages.\r\n\r\nIf  the  ordinary  Kathis are also  given  powers  to\r\n\r\nsolemnise  marriages, I have no  objection  to  their\r\n\r\nhelp. We can even place them on the establishment  of\r\n\r\nthe  Court.  I  have  already explained  the  reasons\r\n\r\nearlier in my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.15 p.m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, as a woman, I wonder whether,  if  this\r\n\r\nmatter  is referred to a Select Committee, Government\r\n\r\nwould consider inviting the views of Muslim\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwomen to be represented to the Select Committee, just\r\n\r\nas  they  have done with the Pawnbrokers  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.

I must admit that I am not well-versed  in religious matters, and thus my interviews\r\n\r\nwith  people  who  are  themselves  well  versed   in\r\n\r\nreligious matters have benefited me a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what has been expressed by the Member for Kampong Kembangan has been very misleading indeed\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  far as I know, if I am not  wrong,  the\r\n\r\nKathi  is the guardian of the Prophet Mohammed. Peace\r\n\r\nbe  unto him. No ordinary man can become a Kathi. The\r\n\r\nKathi  is a guardian of the Law of Islam and is  held\r\n\r\nin high esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the amendment. If we have many Kathis who\r\n\r\ncan solemnise marriages and there are men who wish to\r\n\r\nmarry more than one wife, I think there is no purpose\r\n\r\nin  this  Government restricting  the  many  divorces\r\n\r\nwhich  are prevalent among the Muslim community.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  Mr Speaker, many Kathis are permitted  to\r\n\r\nsolemnise  marriages for men who already have  wives.\r\n\r\nAs an example, a Muslim goes to a Kathi and tells him\r\n\r\nthat  he  wishes to marry another girl. The Ordinance\r\n\r\nsays  that if he can afford to maintain two wives  he\r\n\r\ncan do so because there are no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch restrictions. It follows, therefore, that if  he\r\n\r\nis  not permitted to take another wife, he will  then\r\n\r\nnaturally go to another Kathi, and if he fails in his\r\n\r\nsecond effort, he will go to the next Kathi, until in\r\n\r\nthe  end  all the Kathis have been approached because\r\n\r\nbeing  a human being, he will make an all-out  effort\r\n\r\nto  get married to another girl if he wants to marry.\r\n\r\nBut he will make no attempt to raise his standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.  I  have heard it said that if we  take  four\r\n\r\nwives  we  will  be  following the footsteps  of  the\r\n\r\nProphet Mohammed but that we do not practise what the\r\n\r\nProphet  practises, that is to say, say  our  prayers\r\n\r\nfive  times  a  day. If the power  to  solemnise  the\r\n\r\nmarriage of persons who already have wives is  vested\r\n\r\nonly  in  one Kathi, it will mean that there will  be\r\n\r\nless  people who can marry more than one  wife.

May I have an explanation, please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As I have said earlier,\r\n\r\nI  am  not well versed in religious matters, but  the\r\n\r\nKathi  is  a  guardian  or a  representative  of  the\r\n\r\nProphet  so far as it concerns marriages between  men\r\n\r\nand  women; not, as the Member for Kampong  Kembangan\r\n\r\nsaid,  that  the  Kathi is merely a witness  so  that\r\n\r\nanybody can be a Kathi. I can be a Kathi. All  right,\r\n\r\nlet  me  marry  them. But this is not the  case,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. Because, in accordance with Islamic law, the\r\n\r\nposition of the Kathi is held in high esteem, as  far\r\n\r\nas  it affects the solemnisation of marriages between\r\n\r\nmen and women both of Islamic faith. I have said that\r\n\r\nI  am  not well versed in religious matters, but  the\r\n\r\nviews that I have expressed have been derived from my\r\n\r\ncontacts  with  people. I do not wish to  condemn  or\r\n\r\ncriticise  the Kathis, but I have heard  cases  where\r\n\r\nsome  of  them  have  not fulfilled  their  functions\r\n\r\nfactually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, we find from the statistics that  divorces\r\n\r\nare   prevalent,  because  unscrupulous  persons  are\r\n\r\nexploiting  Muslim  women on  the  grounds  that  the\r\n\r\nIslamic law permits a man to keep four wives. So this\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention is to  prevent  Muslim  women\r\n\r\nfrom being further oppressed by unscrupulous persons.\r\n\r\nThe  moral practice of this law will be felt  not  by\r\n\r\nanybody  else  but by our own Muslim  society.  After\r\n\r\nhaving  got the views of those people well versed  in\r\n\r\nreligious matters, I agree that only one Kathi should\r\n\r\nbe   given   the   power   to  solemnise   marriages,\r\n\r\nirrespective of whether he is the Chief Kathi  or  an\r\n\r\nordinary  Kathi, in the case of persons  who  already\r\n\r\nhave  wives  in Singapore, because he will  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to carry out a thorough investigation as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  the person concerned is able to afford  more\r\n\r\nthan one wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, I am surprised to hear the debate on the\r\n\r\nIslamic  law.

As far as the Government is concerned, as has\r\n\r\nbeen  stated  by the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development, it is prepared  to\r\n\r\nrefer   this   Bill  to  a  Select  Committee   where\r\n\r\nopportunity  will be given to persons, who  are  more\r\n\r\nwell   versed   with   such  matters,   and   Islamic\r\n\r\nassociations to express their views in line with  the\r\n\r\nteachings of the religion of Islam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as Muslims in the true sense of the word, we must be very careful if we wish to take part\r\n\r\nin  debates touching on Islam, lest we slip up or  we\r\n\r\ngo  beyond  the  limit. I have heard the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan  say, during  the  course  of  the\r\n\r\ndebate, that the Kathi is merely a witness. As I have\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier on, Mr Speaker, it is not my intention\r\n\r\nto  criticise  or advise, because I  am  prepared  to\r\n\r\nadmit that I am not well versed in religious matters.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a responsible Muslim, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink   the  statement that a Kathi is a  witness  is\r\n\r\ncomplete  distortion. I think the Member for  Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan  has  been misled or has  slipped  up.  The\r\n\r\nKathi is not a witness. He is a person delegated with\r\n\r\npowers to solemnise the marriage of a would-be bride.\r\n\r\nThe  father of the bride delegates his power  to  the\r\n\r\nKathi  who  solemnises the marriage. Aside  from  the\r\n\r\nKathi,  we  need  to  have  persons  to  witness  the\r\n\r\nsolemnisation of the marriage. As far as I  know,  it\r\n\r\nis not a mistake. It is a common thing which is being\r\n\r\npractised  when  solemnising  marriages  of   Islamic\r\n\r\npeople.  The  Kathi  performs the solemnisation  and,\r\n\r\naside  from him, there are two other witnesses.  That\r\n\r\nmeans that the Kathi is not a witness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Mr Speaker, this matter concerns\r\n\r\nreligion.  The  Government has  repeatedly  given  an\r\n\r\nassurance that it is prepared to refer this matter to\r\n\r\na  Select Committee where we will be in a position to\r\n\r\nreceive  and  hear  reports  submitted  from  Islamic\r\n\r\nbodies.   So  we  can  give  a  final  decision,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  should  the Islamic  people  agree  by  a\r\n\r\nmajority  with  the amendments. I am quite  sure  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will pay heed to any amendment  which  may\r\n\r\nbe   for   the  good  of  the  people  of  Islam.   I\r\n\r\nparticularly request Members of the Opposition to let\r\n\r\nus finalise this matter in Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  I  wish to say  a  few  words  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject.  Just  now the Member for Kampong  Kembangan\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  Kathi is a witness. I  think  he  is\r\n\r\nunable to understand the real position. I got married\r\n\r\nwhen I was young and I remember a Kathi solemnised my\r\n\r\nmarriage. This means that the Kathi has power  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the subject of solemnising marriages, I agree completely that the power to do so\r\n\r\nshould  be  given only to one person,  that  is,  the\r\n\r\nChief Kathi, the reason being that it will mean  that\r\n\r\nthe  wives will be protected from being oppressed  by\r\n\r\ntheir  husbands who try to make use of them  only  as\r\n\r\nplaythings. Or maybe because their wives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  not beautiful or they are already aged, so they,\r\n\r\nonly  through lust, try to marry another one.  If  we\r\n\r\nappoint   only   one   man  who  can   perform   this\r\n\r\nsolemnisation ceremony, I am confident that more than\r\n\r\none  marriage will be curtailed or marriages will  be\r\n\r\nreduced to a minimum. But, Mr Speaker, if this power\r\n\r\nto  solemnise marriages is given to many  Kathis,  as\r\n\r\nexplained by my colleagues just now, and if one Kathi\r\n\r\nrefuses  to solemnise a marriage, the matter will  go\r\n\r\nfrom  one Kathi to another until finally the would-be\r\n\r\nhusband  in  the end succeeds in getting married.  If\r\n\r\nthis  power  is given to many Kathis in Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  not only will a man marry more  than  one\r\n\r\nwife, but he may also be able to marry four wives, in\r\n\r\naccordance   with  the  Islamic  law.  If   this   is\r\n\r\npractised,  it  is  no  use for  this  Government  to\r\n\r\nadminister  the  law in Singapore to  prevent  or  at\r\n\r\nleast  to reduce such tyrannical acts on the part  of\r\n\r\nhusbands  towards their wives by marrying  more  than\r\n\r\none  wife.  Mr Speaker, I agree wholeheartedly  with\r\n\r\nthe sentiments expressed by my colleagues because, in\r\n\r\naddition  to  helping  those wives  who  have  become\r\n\r\nvictims,  we  will be able to prevent  husbands  from\r\n\r\nmarrying more than one wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Minister wish to reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker  as  Chairman and seven other Members  to  be\r\n\r\nnominated by the Committee of Selection.- [Dato Abdul\r\n\r\nHamid].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INTERPRETATION AND GENERAL CLAUSES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

In this way efficiency  on\r\n\r\nboard  ship and safety at sea is preserved.

The   Schedule\r\n\r\ncontains  the  maximum fees that can be  charged  for\r\n\r\nthese  examinations. As it is now intended  that  the\r\n\r\nexamination fees should be increased, it is necessary\r\n\r\ntherefore that this Schedule should also be  revised,\r\n\r\nso that new maxima will be laid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other possibility by which the Marine Department\r\n\r\ncan   levy  fees  is  to  charge  fees  for   matters\r\n\r\ntransacted at the Shipping Offices, for example, when\r\n\r\nshipping companies wish to engage or discharge  crew.\r\n\r\nBut there also is a Schedule of fees for work carried\r\n\r\nout  in  registering the engagement or  discharge  of\r\n\r\nships'  crew. Here, too, it is intended to raise  the\r\n\r\nmaxima of the fees carried out for this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, the sum of money collected from these two\r\n\r\nSchedules  amounted to $21,191.50.

When the Minister moved the  Second\r\n\r\nreading  of the Control of Rent (Amendment)  Bill  on\r\n\r\n16th July, 1959, this is what he said, as reported in\r\n\r\nHansard  of  16th  July,  1959,  at  col.  95,   last\r\n\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Now, Mr Speaker, it is the intention of Government\r\n\r\nto  introduce  at  an early date new  legislation  to\r\n\r\nassist  farmers and householders, but definitely  not\r\n\r\nillegal squatters of land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And he went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The idea of the new legislation is to assist legal\r\n\r\nfarmers    and   legal   householders    to    obtain\r\n\r\ncompensation, or the offer of a suitable  alternative\r\n\r\nsite,  when evicted from land required for  so-called\r\n\r\ndevelopment  purposes.

This Assembly has\r\n\r\nbeen faced with a spate of legislation on matters not\r\n\r\nquite  as  important as this, and some of  them  have\r\n\r\nbeen taken through all the stages at one sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you will remember how\r\n\r\nanxious the Minister for Finance was when he made his\r\n\r\nBudget  speech that building operations in  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  commence  as  rapidly  as  possible  and  how\r\n\r\nimportant it was to encourage the building  trade  to\r\n\r\nget  on its feet. I would submit, with respect to the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development, that this  is  not\r\n\r\nthe way to put the building industry on its feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of encouraging the building\r\n\r\nindustry  in  Singapore: one is  public  housing  and\r\n\r\npublic  building,  and the other is  to  let  private\r\n\r\ndevelopment  carry  on under the  private  sector  of\r\n\r\nbuilding. If the Minister takes another six months to\r\n\r\nframe this Bill, there will be no building operations\r\n\r\nin so far as private development is concerned for the\r\n\r\nnext  six months, because, unless something  is  done\r\n\r\nwith respect to this matter, there can be no building\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  in  so  far  as  private  developers  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While appreciating the anxiety of the Minister to\r\n\r\nprotect  and to assist farmers and other  persons  in\r\n\r\nlegal occupation of land, I think the Minister should\r\n\r\nbear  in  mind the greater interest of Singapore  and\r\n\r\ntry   to  introduce  this  legislation  as  soon   as\r\n\r\npossible.  I  hope that the next six months  will  at\r\n\r\nleast enable the Minister to give birth to new ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, we have given\r\n\r\nthe  greatest attention to the permanent  legislation\r\n\r\nwhich  we  intend  to bring up in  order  to  protect\r\n\r\nfarmers.  However, this legislation is most  involved\r\n\r\nand we have to study precedents in countries like the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom,  Japan,  India,  Pakistan,  and   in\r\n\r\nseveral  other  countries where the same  problem  of\r\n\r\nlandlords evicting farmers has arisen.

We\r\n\r\nhave  been  informed, particularly in  the  past  few\r\n\r\nweeks, that many legal firms have taken or are trying\r\n\r\nto  take  action on behalf of their clients to  evict\r\n\r\nfarmers, who in most cases are legal tenants  of  the\r\n\r\nland,  for  the purpose of building housing  estates.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, we know that this will  cause  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  hardship to these poor farmers and  tenants,\r\n\r\nand  the legislation which we intend to bring up  has\r\n\r\nnothing  much  to  do  with the building  of  private\r\n\r\nhouses.  We would like persons who are interested  in\r\n\r\nbuilding houses for the public to buy vacant land  of\r\n\r\nwhich there is plenty in Singapore. Most of the  land\r\n\r\nfor  which  eviction orders have been  or  are  being\r\n\r\nobtained  are areas near agricultural zones and  they\r\n\r\nshould be protected in the interests of the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government can assure the House that we shall introduce our intended permanent\r\n\r\nlegislation  at  the earliest possible  moment.

But\r\n\r\nthere  is another way whereby a person may be stopped\r\n\r\nfrom  practising temporarily: in other words, he  may\r\n\r\nbe  suspended. The period of suspension  may  operate\r\n\r\nfor  as  long as a year or perhaps even two or  three\r\n\r\nyears.  So  it is for that reason, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  sought to introduce this amendment  to\r\n\r\nclause 3 (2):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No person shall be appointed to be or act as a\r\n\r\nnotary public unless he is a practising advocate  and\r\n\r\nsolicitor  of the Supreme Court and has so  practised\r\n\r\nfor not less than seven years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not a very neat way of doing it, but it was the\r\n\r\nonly  possible  way I could do it as  the  Bill  now\r\n\r\nstands.  So  that  under  the proposed  amendment  no\r\n\r\nperson  can  act  as  soon  as  he  ceases  to  be  a\r\n\r\npractising advocate and solicitor. In other words, by\r\n\r\noperation  of the law, he will cease to be  a  notary\r\n\r\npublic, whereas in clause 5 he might have been struck\r\n\r\noff  the roll on 1st February, 1960, but the Minister\r\n\r\nmight  not gazette under the clause till the 15th  of\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1960. So it could well be that this  person\r\n\r\ncould claim to act as a notary public although he has\r\n\r\nceased  to have the qualification necessary  for  his\r\n\r\nacting as a notary public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with that purpose and intent in view, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that I have introduced this  amendment\r\n\r\nto clause 3 (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, \"That the words\r\n\r\nproposed  to  be  inserted, be  there  inserted.\"  As\r\n\r\nindicated  by the Member for Farrer Park, the  debate\r\n\r\nmay range over his proposed amendments to clause 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would accept it as\r\n\r\nthere  is  considerable force in what the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park has just said, but I would like to  draw\r\n\r\nhis attention to the provisions of clause 3 (1) where\r\n\r\nit is clearly stated:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister may, from time to time, appoint fit\r\n\r\nand proper persons to be notaries public...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not the intention of\r\n\r\nGovernment to appoint anybody to act as notary public\r\n\r\nand  the Member for Farrer Park has not suggested any\r\n\r\namendment to clause 3 (1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has also referred to\r\n\r\namendments which he is proposing to move to clause  5\r\n\r\nof  the Bill.

It\r\n\r\ngoes  further than that, because he seeks  to  insert\r\n\r\nthe words \"suspend or\" after the word \"hand,\" in line\r\n\r\n29  of page 2 of the Bill.

One does not know. So it could well  be  that\r\n\r\nthe notary public might consider himself entitled  to\r\n\r\npractise  as a notary public between the time  he  is\r\n\r\nstruck off and the time his name is published in  the\r\n\r\nGazette  under the provisions of clause 5.  That  was\r\n\r\nthe first thing that struck me, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing was that a person ceases to be a\r\n\r\npractising advocate and solicitor when, first, he is\r\n\r\nstruck off the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroll and, second, he is suspended. For the period  of\r\n\r\nhis  suspension, he is not entitled to carry  on  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  an  advocate and  solicitor.  Clause  5\r\n\r\nmerely deals with the case of a notary public who has\r\n\r\nbeen  struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors\r\n\r\nof the Supreme Court and leaves untouched the case of\r\n\r\na person who has been suspended from practising as an\r\n\r\nadvocate and solicitor in Singapore. Could this  then\r\n\r\nmean that the Minister might not have power to strike\r\n\r\noff the person who has been suspended and that he can\r\n\r\nonly  strike off the person who has been  struck  off\r\n\r\nthe roll?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make the position absolutely clear and\r\n\r\nsafe, I have moved:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 28, after \"Court\", to insert \"or has\r\n\r\nbeen  suspended  from practising as an  advocate  and\r\n\r\nsolicitor in Singapore\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the marginal note \"Misconduct of\r\n\r\nnotaries  public.\", a person can be  struck  off  the\r\n\r\nroll  of  advocates and solicitors for  two  reasons.\r\n\r\nOne,  for  misconduct and, second, where  he  himself\r\n\r\napplies to be struck off the roll merely because  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  want his name kept on it. So it  would  be\r\n\r\nunfair  to such a person who has voluntarily  applied\r\n\r\nto  have  his name taken off the roll to say that  he\r\n\r\nhas  committed  misconduct. It is with that  purpose,\r\n\r\nSir,  and  to make the position absolutely safe  from\r\n\r\nthat point of view that I have suggested the marginal\r\n\r\ntitle  to  read \"Revocation of appointments.\"  rather\r\n\r\nthan  \"Misconduct  of  notaries public.\", because  a\r\n\r\nnotary public can be struck off the roll not only for\r\n\r\nmisconduct but also because he so wishes it himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I might, of course, indicate to hon.\r\n\r\nMembers that the marginal title of any clause is  not\r\n\r\nstrictly  part  of  a Bill and, therefore,  it  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  agreement  as to  what  marginal  title\r\n\r\nshould  be  used.

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   it   is   necessary  to   prevent   unlicensed\r\n\r\nmoneylenders  from  assigning  their  debts  incurred\r\n\r\nbefore the coming into operation of the Ordinance, as\r\n\r\notherwise  they  will  assign  their  debts  to   the\r\n\r\nregistered  moneylenders and leave  the  country.  In\r\n\r\nsuch  cases, it will be difficult for the  debtor  to\r\n\r\ngive evidence against the unlicensed moneylender. The\r\n\r\nmoneylender who has made loans before the coming into\r\n\r\nforce  of  the Moneylenders Ordinance,  1959,  is  at\r\n\r\nliberty  to collect old debts even though he  is  not\r\n\r\nlicensed.  He  may sue in respect of old  debts  even\r\n\r\nthough  he does not possess a licence. But we do  not\r\n\r\npropose  in  any way to allow a further extension  of\r\n\r\nthat,  because if we did that, nothing would prevent,\r\n\r\nsay,  an unregistered moneylender from assigning  his\r\n\r\ndebts   to   a  moneylender  registered   under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  this  Ordinance and  then  leave  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  In  such a situation, the debtor  would  be\r\n\r\ndefenceless against the unlicensed moneylender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while appreciating\r\n\r\nthat  there is a point in what the Minister has said,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  see how an assignment of a  debt  in  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  set out by the Minister  would  render\r\n\r\nthe  person  who  has borrowed the money  defenceless\r\n\r\nagainst  the assignee. If the Minister could convince\r\n\r\nme  that  that would be so, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  ready to withdraw the amendment. But I  cannot\r\n\r\nsee how an assignment by an unlicensed moneylender to\r\n\r\na  licensed  moneylender could operate to defeat  the\r\n\r\ndebtor,  because the assignee would have' no  greater\r\n\r\nrights  in the matter than the assignor himself,  and\r\n\r\nany  defence  available to the borrower  against  the\r\n\r\nassignor would be available to the debtor against the\r\n\r\nassignee, the present holder of the note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  knows, the purpose of the  Moneylenders\r\n\r\nOrdinance is to grant the debtors protection  against\r\n\r\nunscrupulous moneylenders, and that protection  takes\r\n\r\nmany forms. One is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequirement   that   moneylenders  should   register.\r\n\r\nHitherto  they were never required to register.  Even\r\n\r\nwhen  they have registered, there is also the further\r\n\r\nprotection  to the debtor that in these money-lending\r\n\r\ntransactions  the debtor can raise  issues  that  are\r\n\r\nreferred  to in our amendment to section  24  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance in clause 4. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is always\r\n\r\nthe  bone  of contention in moneylending transactions\r\n\r\nthat the debtor has signed for much more than he  has\r\n\r\nreceived. Hitherto, all that the moneylender has  had\r\n\r\nto  do was to produce the promissory note, and if the\r\n\r\ndebtor  had  signed a promissory note for more,  then\r\n\r\nhis  receipt would preclude him from raising such  an\r\n\r\nissue  as  soon as the promissory note was  produced.\r\n\r\nBut  today,  it will be open to the debtor  to  raise\r\n\r\nthat as a specific issue against the moneylender;  in\r\n\r\nwhich  case  the moneylender will have to prove  from\r\n\r\nevidence  other  than the evidence of the  promissory\r\n\r\nnote  itself that he has given the debtor the  amount\r\n\r\nthat  he  claims  to have done. If we  allowed  these\r\n\r\nassignments, then the debtor would never be  able  to\r\n\r\nraise  these issues against the moneylender  who  has\r\n\r\nassigned his rights to the registered moneylender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In other words, it is the Minister's\r\n\r\nintention that this clause should operate in this way\r\n\r\nthen - that the moneylender should be available to  the\r\n\r\nborrower  for purposes of cross-examination in  court\r\n\r\nwhen the debt is pursued.

As I understand it, after\r\n\r\nthe new Moneylenders Ordinance came into force, which\r\n\r\ndeleted  this  provision from section 2  of  the  old\r\n\r\nMoneylenders  Ordinance, there has been  considerable\r\n\r\ndoubt  as to whether any person lending money on  the\r\n\r\nsecurity of a mortgage is a moneylender or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat doubt has been enhanced by the behaviour of  the\r\n\r\nStamp  Office  in  these mortgages. It  appears,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker - and I have information on this which  I  have\r\n\r\nno  reason  to  doubt - that  when  a  person  takes  a\r\n\r\nmortgage deed to the Stamp Office to be stamped,  the\r\n\r\nstamping   officer  asks,  \"Is  this  a  moneylending\r\n\r\ntransaction?\" With great respect, I do not  see  what\r\n\r\nbusiness  it is of the stamping officer to  ask  that\r\n\r\nquestion.  The  business of the Stamp  Office  is  to\r\n\r\nstamp  a  document presented to it according  to  the\r\n\r\nlaws  of  the country and, if the person:  presenting\r\n\r\nthe  document is late, to exact a penalty if that  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  But why any officer in the  Stamp  Office\r\n\r\nshould want to find out whether a mortgage deed is  a\r\n\r\nmoneylending transaction or not, I am at  a  loss  to\r\n\r\nunderstand. What is happening is this. The officer in\r\n\r\ncharge  of the Stamp Office has been saying, \"If  you\r\n\r\ncannot get a certificate from your solicitor, I  must\r\n\r\nhave  a  statutory declaration from you that you  are\r\n\r\nnot  a  moneylender.\" Mr Speaker, Sir, no  solicitor\r\n\r\nwould  say  that, in his opinion or to his knowledge,\r\n\r\nthe  lender is not a moneylender. He cannot give that\r\n\r\ncertificate because he cannot say. So the person  who\r\n\r\nlends  the  money, if he wishes to get  the  document\r\n\r\nstamped,  must swear a declaration that he is  not  a\r\n\r\nmoneylender. He must also say that that  is  not  his\r\n\r\nsecond  or  third transaction because, if it  is  his\r\n\r\nsecond  or  third  transaction,  then  apparently  he\r\n\r\nbecomes  a moneylender, although in the eyes  of  the\r\n\r\nlaw,  he  might  not  be carrying on  a  moneylending\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if a person retires from\r\n\r\nGovernment or Municipal or any other service, and  if\r\n\r\nhe  receives,  say, a gratuity or  a  provident  fund\r\n\r\npayment of $20,000 or $30,000, what does that  person\r\n\r\ndo?  He either invests some of his money on mortgages\r\n\r\nor he puts it in a business, or he deposits it with a\r\n\r\nbank, or he invests it with a pawnbroker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Or he spends it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Or he spends it!

If  you take it to a bank and  deposit  it\r\n\r\nthere  at  6  per  cent,  as  some  banks  do,  I  am\r\n\r\ntold - others  give 3 and 4 per cent -   that  is  not  a\r\n\r\nmoneylending transaction. That is a laudable thing to\r\n\r\ndo  and it is called an investment. But if you  would\r\n\r\nbe  so  foolish as to put your money on an investment\r\n\r\nwhich secures you the return of that money by way  of\r\n\r\na mortgage on an immovable property, the Stamp Office\r\n\r\nimmediately brands you as a moneylender and will  not\r\n\r\nstamp the mortgage deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased to hear the Minister make the\r\n\r\nstatement that the Moneylenders Ordinance is intended\r\n\r\nto   affect   those   persons   whose   business   is\r\n\r\nmoneylending.  If  I can have the  assurance  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  the  sort  of  thing  which  I   have\r\n\r\nmentioned just now will not happen again in the Stamp\r\n\r\nOffice,  that  people  who go  there  to  have  their\r\n\r\ndocuments  stamped will not be harassed  by  stamping\r\n\r\nofficers, and that stamping officers will merely look\r\n\r\nat  the mortgage deed and stamp it according to  what\r\n\r\nis  laid down in the law, then I am quite prepared to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  this amendment, because, in  my  own  view,\r\n\r\npersons  who  carry  out such  transactions  are  not\r\n\r\nmoneylenders; they do not come within  the  ambit  of\r\n\r\nthe  operation  of this Ordinance.  That  is  only  a\r\n\r\npersonal  view. But if the Stamp Office is  going  to\r\n\r\nmake  it  impossible for these people to  have  their\r\n\r\ndocuments  stamped,  then I  think  it  is  time  the\r\n\r\nMinister looked into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed obliged to\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Farrer Park for raising this  matter\r\n\r\nthis  afternoon. I think there is a great distinction\r\n\r\nbetween moneylending, which is run as a business, and\r\n\r\nmoney  which  is given out on loan, however  frequent\r\n\r\nthe  transactions may be. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Farrer  Park  has  overlooked  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  section  23, subsection  (5)  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No person who is neither a moneylender nor one of\r\n\r\nthe  persons  referred to in paragraphs  (a)  to  (e)\r\n\r\ninclusive   of   the   definition  of   \"moneylender\"\r\n\r\ncontained  in section 2 of this Ordinance  shall,  in\r\n\r\nrespect of money lent by him, in any case recover  in\r\n\r\nexcess of the money actually lent by him (whether the\r\n\r\nexcess  be  claimed by way of interest or  otherwise)\r\n\r\nany  sum  greater  than  an amount  equal  to  simple\r\n\r\ninterest  at the rate of twenty per centum per  annum\r\n\r\non the money actually lent by him.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  would  cover the case of persons who  lend  out\r\n\r\nmoney  on  mortgages as investments. I am aware,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. Sir, of the practice that has been obtaining\r\n\r\nin  the Stamp Office. With regard to the stamping  of\r\n\r\npromissory notes, it has been brought to my attention\r\n\r\nthat the officers there have behaved in the way which\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park has said that  they  have\r\n\r\ndone. I have instructed the State Advocate-General to\r\n\r\ninform  these officers that it does not  follow  that\r\n\r\nmoney lent on mortgages is necessarily a moneylending\r\n\r\ntransaction, because the Ordinance itself requires  a\r\n\r\nlicence  to be obtained only by a person who  engages\r\n\r\nin  the business of money-lending. I thought that the\r\n\r\nmatter  has since been put right, but in view of  the\r\n\r\nrepresentations which the Member for Farrer Park  has\r\n\r\njust made in this Assembly, I shall ask the S.A.G. to\r\n\r\nissue further instructions to the officers concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of the Minister's assurance, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, may I have leave to withdraw  the  new\r\n\r\nclause?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The motion to withdraw is really the\r\n\r\nmotion,  \"That the clause be read a Second time.\"  Is\r\n\r\nit the pleasure of honourable Members that the motion\r\n\r\nbe withdrawn?

The fact that  a  borrower\r\n\r\nhas  signed a note or memorandum which complies  with\r\n\r\nthe provisions of section 16 of this Ordinance and in\r\n\r\nwhich the amount of the money lent to and received by\r\n\r\nthe borrower is set out shall not of itself raise any\r\n\r\npresumption that the amount of money so  set  out  is\r\n\r\nactually  lent  to or received by the  borrower.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, by virtue of the provisions of  section\r\n\r\n30  of  the  Moneylenders Ordinance, which  reads  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) Whenever a promissory note is taken as security\r\n\r\nfor  any  loan and the borrower is a person who  does\r\n\r\nnot  understand the English language on such note the\r\n\r\nnote  shall be attested by an advocate and solicitor,\r\n\r\na  Magistrate, Justice of the Peace, commissioner for\r\n\r\noaths or such other person as may be appointed by the\r\n\r\nMinister  generally  for such purpose.  The  attestor\r\n\r\nshall explain the terms of the promissory note to the\r\n\r\nborrower, and shall certify thereon that the borrower\r\n\r\nappeared  to understand the meaning of the same.  The\r\n\r\nmoney  borrowed shall be paid over by the  lender  to\r\n\r\nthe  borrower  in  the presence of the  attestor  who\r\n\r\nshall certify the fact upon the promissory note.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  that  any  note signed by a person who  does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  the English language or the  language  in\r\n\r\nwhich the note is written -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. My copy of the Ordinance has\r\n\r\n\"written  language\"  on it. I think  the  Member  was\r\n\r\nsaying the \"English language\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon. It is \"written\r\n\r\nlanguage\".  Now, clause 4, Sir, takes in  all  notes,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  notes which are understood by  the  person\r\n\r\nsigning  the  note so far as the written language  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, and notes which are not understood. In  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  the  notes  the language  of  which  is  not\r\n\r\nunderstood   by  the  borrower  are  concerned,   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of section 30 have to be complied with. In\r\n\r\nthose circumstances, the whole of the transaction  is\r\n\r\ndone  either  before  an advocate  and  solicitor,  a\r\n\r\nMagistrate, a Justice of the Peace, or a commissioner\r\n\r\nfor  oaths,  or  such other person appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  generally  for such purpose.  So  that  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  section 30 see to it that  everything\r\n\r\nthat should be done for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nborrower  is  done for him - the money must  be  given,\r\n\r\ncertification   must  be  made - in  fact,   there   is\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no room for any slip-up in respect  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  who does not understand the written  language\r\n\r\non   the   note.  Now  clause  4  takes  in  such   a\r\n\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, to put it my way, to be a mockery\r\n\r\nthat,  where the provisions of section 30  have  come\r\n\r\ninto  operation  in  respect of  a  particular  note,\r\n\r\nclause  4  should also come into operation again  and\r\n\r\nsay  that  that note in itself shall not be  evidence\r\n\r\nand the borrower himself may try to upset it. Now, if\r\n\r\nthat  became  the practice and the law, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthen  transactions before a Justice of the  Peace,  a\r\n\r\nMagistrate, or a commissioner for oaths, would become\r\n\r\nquite meaningless, and the law would be a subject for\r\n\r\nridicule.  That is why I moved the amendment  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  a  person \"who does not understand  the\r\n\r\nwritten language on such note\" should be deleted. The\r\n\r\neffect  of that, Mr Speaker, will be that all notes,\r\n\r\nwhether  their language is understood by the borrower\r\n\r\nor  not,  shall be treated under section 30 and  they\r\n\r\nmust   either  be  signed  before  an  advocate   and\r\n\r\nsolicitor, a Magistrate, a Justice of the Peace, or a\r\n\r\ncommissioner for oaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this amendment is accepted, Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nwill get away from this rather ridiculous position of\r\n\r\nthe  borrower every now and then, even though he  had\r\n\r\nsigned  the  note willingly and with full  knowledge,\r\n\r\nsetting up a defence that he did not know what he was\r\n\r\nsigning and that he got less than what he signed for.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, you can protect a person up  to  a\r\n\r\npoint, but beyond that he must fend for himself. I do\r\n\r\nnot think the law should spoon-feed him too much. The\r\n\r\npurpose  of my amendment to section 30, Sir, is  that\r\n\r\nonce  the provisions of section 30 have been complied\r\n\r\nwith and the note has been signed and attested either\r\n\r\nbefore  an advocate and solicitor, a Justice  of  the\r\n\r\nPeace,  a  Magistrate, a commissioner for  oaths,  or\r\n\r\nsuch  other  person appointed by the Minister,  there\r\n\r\nshall  be a finality to the matter and the matter  of\r\n\r\n\"I  did  not sign it\", \"I did not receive the  money\"\r\n\r\nshall  not be raised again; otherwise there shall  be\r\n\r\nno end to litigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say at the\r\n\r\noutset  that  it  is an attractive  amendment  as  it\r\n\r\nwould, I agree, strengthen the law considerably.  But\r\n\r\non the other hand, it would make it necessary for all\r\n\r\npromissory notes to be attested. That would certainly\r\n\r\ngive  more  work  to  lawyers,  and  it  would  incur\r\n\r\nadditional  cost  to the borrower. For  that  reason,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Government is not prepared to accept  that\r\n\r\namendment  because this section 30 deals specifically\r\n\r\nwith  the  attestation of promissory notes where  the\r\n\r\nborrower  does  not understand the  language  of  the\r\n\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour and Law that no lawyer would\r\n\r\never  get himself mixed up under section 30; it would\r\n\r\nnot pay him. Every time he puts his signature to such\r\n\r\na  note, it merely means that he will be called as  a\r\n\r\nwitness  in  all legal proceedings relating  to  that\r\n\r\nnote.  And no lawyer, who is worthy of his  name,  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to get mixed up in these transactions.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  him that there will be only very few  lawyers\r\n\r\nin  town who will act under the provisions of section\r\n\r\n30, unless he is a philanthropist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I raise this amendment to show\r\n\r\nthat  clause 4, as it stands, will encourage just  as\r\n\r\nmany unscrupulous borrowers as there are unscrupulous\r\n\r\nmoneylenders.   There   are  sometimes   unscrupulous\r\n\r\nborrowers. They borrow money knowing full  well  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  take  full advantage of  the  Moneylenders\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  make things difficult for  a  genuine\r\n\r\nmoneylender. I raise this matter on the  basis  that,\r\n\r\nif the Minister acceded to my suggested amendment, it\r\n\r\nwould put the matter completely beyond doubt and  the\r\n\r\ndignity of the law would be maintained, and we  would\r\n\r\nnot  reach a position where something which had  been\r\n\r\nexecuted  under  section 30 would  be  liable  to  be\r\n\r\nchallenged  again in Court. And the Judge would  have\r\n\r\nto go seriously into the whole question when possibly\r\n\r\na  Magistrate, who is also an Officer of  the  Court,\r\n\r\nhad  certified it as being correct. It  seems  to  be\r\n\r\nrather  a  ridiculous position for  the  law  to  get\r\n\r\nitself into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provisions of\r\n\r\nsection  30 are normal provisions for the attestation\r\n\r\nof  documents where a person who executes a  document\r\n\r\ndoes  not  understand its language. Such attestations\r\n\r\ncan  be made bona fide and they can also be made mala\r\n\r\nfide.  So  it  is always a question  of  fact  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether there has been proper attestation; so that in\r\n\r\nour  view, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is not necessarily\r\n\r\nany conflict between the provisions of section 30  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance and the new subsection (2) to  section\r\n\r\n24 that we have introduced this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not wish to pursue the matter any\r\n\r\nfurther, but it could well be that a person who  gets\r\n\r\nhis   document  executed  under  section  30  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  stands a much better chance  of  defeating\r\n\r\nany  objection  raised by the borrower under  section\r\n\r\n24, as amended, after this Bill comes into operation.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, I have made my point and I wish to draw\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the Minister to it.

That law grew  up  in\r\n\r\nEngland many years ago and was not entirely suited to\r\n\r\nmodern  conditions,  with the result  that  statutory\r\n\r\namendments  had to be made to the law  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  particularly by the Law of  Libel  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nAct of 1888 and the Slander of Women Act, 1891. These\r\n\r\nstatutory amendments were incorporated into  the  law\r\n\r\nin  Singapore by the Libel Ordinance, which was first\r\n\r\nenacted by Ordinance No. 7 of 1915 and is now Chapter\r\n\r\n28  of  the  Revised Edition. In  1952,  the  law  in\r\n\r\nEngland was further amended by the Defamation Act  of\r\n\r\n1952. The provisions of this Act have been adopted in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya by the Defamation Ordinance\r\n\r\nof  1957, and this Bill seeks to incorporate  in  our\r\n\r\nlaw the provisions of that Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those Members in this House who\r\n\r\nare  lawyers will know that the essence of defamation\r\n\r\nis to say something to the discredit of somebody else\r\n\r\nand  to hold him up to hatred, ridicule, or contempt.\r\n\r\nThe common lawyers drew a distinction between written\r\n\r\nand  spoken  words,  and it was considered  that  one\r\n\r\nshould  not  treat  spoken words  which  were  spoken\r\n\r\nrather  hurriedly  in the same way as  words  written\r\n\r\nafter  due deliberation. They, therefore, established\r\n\r\nthe   rule   that,  if  a  person  writes   something\r\n\r\ndefamatory  of somebody else, that other  person  can\r\n\r\nbring  an action without showing that he had actually\r\n\r\nsuffered  any  damage at all; but if  a  person  says\r\n\r\nsomething  defamatory of somebody  else,  that  other\r\n\r\nperson can only bring an action for slander if he had\r\n\r\nor  could  prove that he had suffered actual  damage,\r\n\r\nsuch as losing a paid employment or losing a valuable\r\n\r\ncontract. There were certain exceptions to this  rule\r\n\r\neven  under the Common Law. For example, to accuse  a\r\n\r\nman of a criminal offence was actionable per se, that\r\n\r\nis,  without proof of special damage. The Slander  of\r\n\r\nWomen  Act,  1891,  provided that  words  spoken  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand published which impute unchastity or adultery to  any\r\n\r\nwoman  or  girl shall not require special  damage  to\r\n\r\nrender  them  actionable,  and  this  provision   was\r\n\r\nincorporated into the law in Singapore by  the  Libel\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill re-enacts this provision of the\r\n\r\nlaw.   In   addition,  the  Bill   incorporates the\r\n\r\namendments made by the Defamation Act of 1952.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides that for the purposes\r\n\r\nof  libel  and slander, the broadcasting of words  by\r\n\r\nmeans  of  the radio should be treated as publication\r\n\r\nin  a  permanent form, that is to say, it  should  be\r\n\r\ntreated  as  libel,  and does not  require  proof  of\r\n\r\nspecial damage to be actionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends the law to some extent\r\n\r\nwith regard to slander spoken of a person in relation\r\n\r\nto  his  office,  profession or  calling.  Under  the\r\n\r\nCommon  Law, a somewhat subtle distinction was  drawn\r\n\r\nbetween those words which were spoken of a person  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  his  profession and those  which  would\r\n\r\nmerely affect his profession. Thus, it has been  held\r\n\r\nthat  if  a  solicitor is accused  of  dishonesty  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  his  clients, he can  bring  an  action\r\n\r\nwithout  proving  that  he has suffered  any  special\r\n\r\ndamage,  but  if  he  is  accused  of  dishonesty  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  somebody else, other than his  clients,\r\n\r\nthen  he  has  to prove that he has suffered  special\r\n\r\ndamage. Clause 5 of the Bill now provides that in  an\r\n\r\naction for slander in respect of words calculated  to\r\n\r\ndisparage  the  plaintiff in any office,  profession,\r\n\r\ncalling, trade or business held or carried on by  him\r\n\r\nat  the  time  of the publication, it  shall  not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary to allege or prove special damage,  whether\r\n\r\nor  not the words are spoken of the plaintiff in  the\r\n\r\nway  of  his  office, profession, calling,  trade  or\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next change in the law which is proposed in the\r\n\r\nBill  is  in  regard to what is called \"unintentional\r\n\r\ndefamation\". There have been a number of decisions in\r\n\r\nEngland which had laid down the law that a person can\r\n\r\nbe  liable  for libel or slander even  though  he  is\r\n\r\nunaware  of the circumstances in which his  statement\r\n\r\nwas defamatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill following the amendment of the law in the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom seeks to provide that it shall  be  a\r\n\r\ndefence  that  the  defamation was unintentional.  In\r\n\r\nsuch  a case the person can offer to print an apology\r\n\r\nand  correction in the same manner as he printed  the\r\n\r\noriginal libel and, if this is accepted, there  would\r\n\r\nbe  an end of the matter. If it is not accepted,  the\r\n\r\nperson  can  then  prove  that  the  defamation   was\r\n\r\nunintentional  and  in that case he  has  a  complete\r\n\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment proposed by the Bill concerns\r\n\r\nthe principles of justification. It is a defence to a\r\n\r\ncivil action for defamation that what is said of  the\r\n\r\nplaintiff  is  true. But the law was very  strict  on\r\n\r\nthis  and  required the person to prove every  single\r\n\r\nitem of the original defamation. If a person says  of\r\n\r\nanother man, for example, that he was a murderer  and\r\n\r\nthat he missed going to church last Sunday, and he is\r\n\r\nable to prove that the man was in fact a murderer, he\r\n\r\nwould still pay damages for saying he had not gone to\r\n\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill seeks to amend the law by\r\n\r\nproviding that, in an action for libel or slander  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  words  containing two or  more  distinct\r\n\r\ncharges   against  the  plaintiff,   a   defence   of\r\n\r\njustification shall not fail by reason only that  the\r\n\r\ntruth of every charge is not proved if the words  not\r\n\r\nproved  to  be  true  do  not materially  injure  the\r\n\r\nplaintiff's reputation having regard to the truth  of\r\n\r\nthe remaining charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment which I need mention is that a\r\n\r\nconsiderable extension has been made to the law  with\r\n\r\nregard to the privileges of newspapers. It has always\r\n\r\nbeen a defence to a newspaper that it has published a\r\n\r\nfair, accurate and contemporaneous report of judicial\r\n\r\nand  some other proceedings. The Bill seeks to extend\r\n\r\nthese  privileges. Fair, accurate and contemporaneous\r\n\r\naccounts of the proceedings of various bodies are now\r\n\r\neither   absolutely  privileged  or  else  they   are\r\n\r\nprivileged subject to this: that the newspaper may be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  print  a reasonable explanation  if  so\r\n\r\nrequested by the person who claims that he had been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefamed.

In these cases  there  is\r\n\r\nabsolute privilege. It is also provided that  when  a\r\n\r\nfair and accurate copy or extract of a register which\r\n\r\nis  open  to  the  public is  printed  or  a  notice,\r\n\r\nadvertisement  or report issued or published  on  the\r\n\r\nauthority  of any court is published without  malice,\r\n\r\nit is privileged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part II of the Schedule are set out the\r\n\r\ncircumstances in which a fair and accurate report  of\r\n\r\nthe  proceedings  of various other bodies  formed  in\r\n\r\nMalaya  are protected. The privilege, in these  cases\r\n\r\nis  limited in that the newspaper may, if required by\r\n\r\nthe   plaintiff,  have  to  publish  some   form   of\r\n\r\ncorrection  of  any false statement. The  proceedings\r\n\r\nwhich  are  covered by these provisions  include  the\r\n\r\nfindings  or decisions of any association formed  for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of promoting or encouraging art, science,\r\n\r\nreligion  or learning, or formed for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\npromoting  the  interests  of  any  trade,  business,\r\n\r\nindustry  or  profession or persons carrying  on  the\r\n\r\nsame or engaged in any game, sport or pastime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also assimilates radio broadcasting to\r\n\r\nnewspapers and gives to radio broadcasters  the  same\r\n\r\ndefence  vis-a-vis  newspapers  in  respect  of   the\r\n\r\nreports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to insure against libels is clarified and\r\n\r\nthe right, hitherto restricted to newspapers, to give\r\n\r\nevidence  that  the  plaintiff has already  recovered\r\n\r\ndamages from someone else in respect of the same or a\r\n\r\nsimilar libel, is extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is necessary, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  me to deal with the other provisions of the Bill\r\n\r\nas  they do not make any substantial changes  in  the\r\n\r\nexisting law.

It is more likely, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthat  is what the Police want in this matter.

Because  if  he\r\n\r\nwere  to  ask the driver to wait so that he could  go\r\n\r\nback  home and put on his uniform, then the man would\r\n\r\nhave got away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is necessary\r\n\r\nfor me to draw the attention of the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark  to  the distinction between sub-clause (1)  and\r\n\r\nsub-clause (2) of clause 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stop any citizen driving along a road, it would\r\n\r\nbe  necessary that he be stopped by a police  officer\r\n\r\nin  uniform, otherwise he has the right to  disregard\r\n\r\nthe   instruction  to  stop.  Now  in  the  situation\r\n\r\nenvisaged  in sub-clause (2), that refers to  a  case\r\n\r\nwhere  somebody in control of a car is  getting  away\r\n\r\nfrom a person who is pursuing him. The person who  is\r\n\r\npursuing him may very well be a police officer who is\r\n\r\nnot  in  uniform.

Thai  is a very exceptional Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\nCustoms  Ordinance  provides for forfeiture,  because\r\n\r\nrevenue  is  an  important matter to the  State,  and\r\n\r\nanything used to avoid earning revenue for the  State\r\n\r\nis  a subject matter for forfeiture, not only in this\r\n\r\ncountry,  but also in every other civilised  country.\r\n\r\nIn  those circumstances, it is forgivable because the\r\n\r\nState must protect its revenue and any object used in\r\n\r\nthe evasion of State revenue should be forfeited. But\r\n\r\nthe  position  here  is  quite  different.  This  has\r\n\r\nnothing to do with State revenue. It is a matter, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, which affects every citizen  in  every\r\n\r\nwalk  of  life. I might have a car. I  might  have  a\r\n\r\ndriver.  I send him home. He picks up a friend.

Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think the Member for Farrer Park will  agree\r\n\r\nwith  me that, unless you have peace, order and  good\r\n\r\ngovernment, there is no question of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState  collecting  any revenue from  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park.  So it is very necessary that  we  have\r\n\r\nthese  provisions. The Member for Farrer  Park  knows\r\n\r\nthat such provisions are not new provisions. They are\r\n\r\nscattered  right  throughout  our  law.  He  has  put\r\n\r\nforward  the  case of some innocent  person,  with  a\r\n\r\nmissile in his pocket, being suddenly detained by the\r\n\r\npolice  in  a  car and that car is forfeited - spirited\r\n\r\naway under the provisions of this Ordinance. Now,  to\r\n\r\nprevent  that  sort of thing, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General has advised that we make  this\r\n\r\namendment,  that after the word \"court\", we  say  \"on\r\n\r\nthe  application of the State Advocate-General\"  that\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle should be forfeited. The State Advocate-General   is   the  person  who  is  in   charge   of\r\n\r\nprosecutions.  He  reads carefully  through  all  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation papers that he and his officers receive\r\n\r\nand he knows that, in fact, in a case such as the one\r\n\r\nwhich the Member for Farrer Park has just put to this\r\n\r\nHouse,  it will be stupid to forfeit the vehicle  and\r\n\r\nfor that reason this amendment has been proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I entirely agree with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that this section could result in a lot\r\n\r\nof  stupidity.  But  the Minister suggests  that  the\r\n\r\nstupidity  should be relieved in the State  Advocate-General's Office. I am saying that it should  not  be\r\n\r\nrelieved there. Let it go to court, and let the court\r\n\r\ndecide  it. Why should the State Advocate-General  be\r\n\r\ncalled  upon to perform judicial functions  affecting\r\n\r\nproperty?  Why should he have the power  of  deciding\r\n\r\nwhether  a man should be allowed to have his  car  or\r\n\r\nnot?  He  is a law officer, so let him not administer\r\n\r\nthe  law. On the question whether a piece of property\r\n\r\nshould   be  forfeited  or  not,  we  have   adequate\r\n\r\nmachinery  in  this country to deal with it - machinery\r\n\r\nwhich the citizens respect and trust - the courts.  Let\r\n\r\nus  leave the courts to decide such issues,  not  the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General. In this Bill, as soon as  the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General says, \"I think this car should\r\n\r\nbe forfeited,\" the judge has absolutely no option.
