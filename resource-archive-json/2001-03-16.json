Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment (a) how much has been expended so far  in  making\r\n\r\nSingapore  free  from  floods; and (b)  why  has  there  been\r\n\r\nflooding whenever there are heavy downpours in spite of  this\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee\r\n\r\nSay):  Sir, ENV spends $60-$70 million a year to improve  the\r\n\r\ndrains  and canals in Singapore. Since 1984, ENV has spent  a\r\n\r\ntotal   of  $1.3  billion  on  drainage  improvement   works,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  widening and deepening  of  main  drains  and\r\n\r\ncanals to cater for increased storm water runoff arising from\r\n\r\nnew land developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV is committed to reduce flooding in Singapore and has\r\n\r\nover  the  years,  progressively  implemented  many  drainage\r\n\r\nimprovement projects to alleviate and prevent flooding.  This\r\n\r\ninvestment in drainage infrastructure has paid off.  In spite\r\n\r\nof  rapid  urbanisation and intensified  redevelopments,  the\r\n\r\nflood   situation  in  Singapore  has  continued  to  improve\r\n\r\nsignificantly.   There  are now 238 hectares  of  flood-prone\r\n\r\nareas  as  compared to some 3,200 hectares in  the  1970s,  a\r\n\r\nreduction  of more than 90%.  The floods are less severe  and\r\n\r\nare of relatively short duration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ENV will continue to improve the existing drains\r\n\r\nand  canals  to  alleviate  flooding  in  flood-prone  areas,\r\n\r\nwhenever it is cost-effective to do so.  However, it  is  not\r\n\r\nfeasible  to completely rid Singapore of all floods  for  two\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, some of the areas such as those in Boat Quay\r\n\r\nand  Chinatown are low-lying and are barely above  high  tide\r\n\r\nlevel.   These premises remain prone to flooding,  especially\r\n\r\nwhen  heavy rain coincides with high tide. The only effective\r\n\r\nflood  control measure is to raise the ground levels of these\r\n\r\npremises in conjunction with redevelopment plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a limit to which we can widen drains\r\n\r\nbecause  of  land constraints.  Very intense rainfall,  which\r\n\r\nmay  occur  once every five years or so, could overwhelm  the\r\n\r\ncapacity of the drains and cause flash floods.  Such  floods,\r\n\r\nhowever, could be minor and of short duration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Harun and the House that ENV\r\n\r\nis  committed  to  press  on  with our  drainage  improvement\r\n\r\nprojects  to  reduce flooding in Singapore, and to  keep  the\r\n\r\nflood situation well under control.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A.

Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I was surprised\r\n\r\nwhen  the Acting Minister for the Environment mentioned  that\r\n\r\nthe  Chinatown area is low-lying.

Most  of  the\r\n\r\nsubstances and materials that we use for our products are not\r\n\r\nrenewable.  We must take action to conserve the resources  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  leave  behind sufficient quantities  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture generations of mankind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycle, reuse and reduction will be the movement by\r\n\r\nenvironment   lovers,  and  responsible  world  citizens   to\r\n\r\nconserve our resources.  From what I read, a BMW car contains\r\n\r\na  high percentage of materials which could be recycled.  You\r\n\r\ncan  sell the car to a company for recycling when it  is  due\r\n\r\nfor scrap.  Do we have any policy, setting the constraints in\r\n\r\nthe recycled contents in our new product and the contents  of\r\n\r\nwhich could be recycled when it is scrapped?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision for compulsory recycled contents in\r\n\r\nproducts has to be commercially viable.  However, if  nothing\r\n\r\nis  done, the concept of recycling will never take place.  At\r\n\r\nleast,   we   should  have  some  financial   incentives   or\r\n\r\nencouragement to include recycled contents, or increasing the\r\n\r\nrecyclability  of the products could be made more  attractive\r\n\r\nfor   the  manufacturers'  participation.   Do  we  have  any\r\n\r\nincentive  schemes to encourage people to work  towards  this\r\n\r\nobjective?  Our Government should show support to the recycle\r\n\r\nmovement  by imposing recycled contents in some of their  own\r\n\r\nprojects  if cost and quality are neutral.  One good  example\r\n\r\nis  requiring  door-frames and wooden floor materials  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  of recycled wood for public housing.  In fact,  I  have\r\n\r\nseen the product, and no layman can tell the difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen recycled bins in schools and in shopping\r\n\r\ncentres, but we can hardly see any recycled products on  sale\r\n\r\nin  the  consumer market.  Even if there are,  like  recycled\r\n\r\npapers, greeting cards and envelopes, they do not seem to  be\r\n\r\ncommonly  used  and  acceptable  by  the  people.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nrecycled  products  are still fighting a  tough  battle  with\r\n\r\nnormal  products.   Is there a way that the Government  could\r\n\r\nhelp  to make recycled products more attractive, in terms  of\r\n\r\npricing and to make known to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupporters  of  the  recycle movement?  If  so,  it  requires\r\n\r\nidentification  of  the recycled products,  in  other  words,\r\n\r\nlabelling of recycled products.  Are we prepared to  consider\r\n\r\nlabelling all recycled products?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycled products could only be viable if the public\r\n\r\naccepts  them.   Making people understand the  importance  of\r\n\r\nrecycling  to be an action towards resource conservation  and\r\n\r\nenvironmental  sustainability is the key to  the  success  of\r\n\r\nrecycling.   We should have an education programme,  teaching\r\n\r\nand persuading people to feel good about supporting and using\r\n\r\nrecycled products.  Would the Government consider launching a\r\n\r\nRecycle Campaign with the NGOs and schools to increase  their\r\n\r\nawareness in support of the recycle and reuse movement?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, yesterday, the\r\n\r\nMinister  said  that  at  the current  rate  of  solid  waste\r\n\r\ngeneration  and  disposal, we would need  to  build  one  new\r\n\r\nincineration  plant,  occupying about 7 hectares  every  five\r\n\r\nyears, and one new landfill, the size of Sentosa Island every\r\n\r\n25-30  years.   He has put forward these statistics  to  show\r\n\r\nthat  this  situation  is  not tenable.   He  said  that  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  would  look into a solution of  closing  the  solid\r\n\r\nwaste  generation loop, ie, to have more recycling.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that he seriously consider another solution,\r\n\r\nin addition to closing of the loop, that is, the reduction of\r\n\r\nwaste generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce waste generation is very easy to say but the\r\n\r\nreal question is how.  In this area, I am afraid that many of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's current initiatives are to increase  prices\r\n\r\nto  discourage  the  generation of  waste.   Is  this  really\r\n\r\neffective?   Sir, like drugs, the pain of higher prices  will\r\n\r\nbecome   less  effective  with  time  and,  therefore,   more\r\n\r\nincreases   are  normally  needed  to  overcome  the   higher\r\n\r\nthreshold  of  pain.  The result is that we may, unwittingly,\r\n\r\nbecome  a  higher  and higher cost country  and  become  less\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with privatisation of solid waste collection, the\r\n\r\nprivate  collectors  will  be  required  to  institute  waste\r\n\r\nrecycling schemes in public housing and landed properties  to\r\n\r\nreduce generation of solid\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwaste.   Pushing this problem to the private sector will  not\r\n\r\nresolve the problem at all.  All it does is to pass the  buck\r\n\r\nto  the private sector on what originally was and still is  a\r\n\r\nnational problem.  Moreover, if mandated to do so by  law,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  believe that the private sector will do a  good  and\r\n\r\nproper  job.   What  may happen would be some  activities  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  the bare minimum of what the laws require, with  the\r\n\r\nhigher cost being passed on to consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Acting Minister has also said that currently,\r\n\r\nonly about 40% of solid waste generated is recycled.  Even if\r\n\r\nthe  figure can be increased to 50% or 60%, we will  soon  be\r\n\r\nreaching  the limits of recycling.  Therefore, the Government\r\n\r\nmust  do  more  to get Singaporeans to reduce  and  to  reuse\r\n\r\nproducts,   ie,  the  2Rs  of  what  we  call  the   4Rs   of\r\n\r\nenvironmental care  -  reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, right now, the preferred method in this area of\r\n\r\nreduction  and  reuse,  as  I said  earlier,  appears  to  be\r\n\r\norientated at the end of the process.  That means you  charge\r\n\r\nhigher  and higher prices for removing garbage, in  order  to\r\n\r\npersuade people not to generate so much garbage.  As  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier, I doubt this will work in the long run.  Sir, I like\r\n\r\nto see the Acting Minister put more emphasis on the beginning\r\n\r\nof the process, ie, try to educate, encourage and help people\r\n\r\nto  generate less garbage, which is to reduce.  And where  it\r\n\r\nis  not  possible to reduce, then individual  households  and\r\n\r\ncompanies,   or  those  who  generate  garbage,   should   be\r\n\r\nencouraged to reuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a thousand and one ways of doing this,\r\n\r\nprovided  the Government is willing to do so.  And the  money\r\n\r\nsaved  in  building  less incineration plants  and  landfills\r\n\r\ncould  be better used to provide the means for the people  to\r\n\r\nreuse and to reduce.  I believe that if we can come out  with\r\n\r\nsome form of financial incentive to reward those who generate\r\n\r\nless garbage, perhaps we will see more success in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I think there are many NGOs more than\r\n\r\nwilling to provide ideas and assistance.  These are the  NGOS\r\n\r\nin  the  environmental field.  Sir, the other countries  have\r\n\r\nalso  gone  a  long way in this direction.  We can  certainly\r\n\r\nlearn from their experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, can I take my\r\n\r\ntwo cuts together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Khoon Lap:</b> Sir, the Minister and several\r\n\r\nMembers have touched on the solid waste problem yesterday and\r\n\r\ntoday.   But few Singaporeans realise it to be such,  because\r\n\r\nthey  take  it  for granted that after the rubbish  has  been\r\n\r\nthrown out, it is taken away by a refuse truck and they never\r\n\r\nsee  it  again.   Very  few Singaporeans know  what  actually\r\n\r\nhappens  to the refuse after that.  As Singapore has  a  very\r\n\r\ndense population with very limited land area, refuse disposal\r\n\r\nis of major concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mr Heng and Prof. Low have already touched on\r\n\r\nsome  figures, I would like to go into a bit more details  to\r\n\r\ndrive  home  the point.  The amount of waste we produce  each\r\n\r\nday  is  on  the increase.  I was informed that in  the  year\r\n\r\n2000, the total tonnage of waste was 7,640 tons per day.  The\r\n\r\namount  of  refuse in one year can occupy about  54  football\r\n\r\nfields.   With an increase of 5% per year, it would  increase\r\n\r\nto  a  staggering 12,500 tons per day within 10  years.   The\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Ministry will have to build one new incineration\r\n\r\nplant  every five years to cope with this.  Currently,  there\r\n\r\nare four incineration plants.  By the year 2030, we will need\r\n\r\n10  incineration plants to dispose  of all our daily  wastes.\r\n\r\nAll  in all, this will require 7 hectares of land and a  cost\r\n\r\nof almost $1 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, more seriously, besides allocating more land and\r\n\r\nfinancial  resources  to build more incineration  plants,  we\r\n\r\nalso  need to allocate more landfill space for the ashes  and\r\n\r\nwastes  that cannot be burnt.  As mentioned by the  Minister,\r\n\r\nat  the  current rate of waste generation, we  will  need  to\r\n\r\nallocate  landfill space about the size of Sentosa island  at\r\n\r\nthe rate of one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery 30 years.  It is certainly a frightening thought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know from the Minister, apart from the\r\n\r\nfour plants he mentioned yesterday, what concerted effort  is\r\n\r\nbeing  taken  to  address this particular problem.   Because,\r\n\r\napart  from  the  sheer quantity of waste  that  we  have  to\r\n\r\nhandle, we also have to consider the pollution damage  caused\r\n\r\nto  our  environment.  I would like to propose that we should\r\n\r\ndo  more to educate the population of the seriousness of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.   We  should consider all measures to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nwaste  generated  each day.  We must change  the  mindset  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that waste disposal is a problem to be solved by\r\n\r\nthe  Environment  Ministry  alone.   But  it  is  not  a  one\r\n\r\ndimensional problem.  Even if new technologies are found  for\r\n\r\nmore  efficient methods of waste disposal, as long as we keep\r\n\r\non  generating waste needlessly, the problem will grow bigger\r\n\r\nand one day, it may become unsolvable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a related subject of waste disposal is\r\n\r\nrecycling.   We often talk about the importance of recycling,\r\n\r\nbut  all the talk never seems to be able to materialise  into\r\n\r\nmuch  action.   It  is high time we changed  our  mindset  on\r\n\r\nrecycling.   Recycling  has always  been  a  major  issue  of\r\n\r\nenvironmental    consideration,   but   this    environmental\r\n\r\nconsideration  has  always  been  overshadowed  by  the  cost\r\n\r\nconsideration.   It  is  often  more  expensive  to   recycle\r\n\r\nsomething than simply producing it from new materials.   This\r\n\r\nis  the reason why recycling has never been able to take  off\r\n\r\nin  a  big way.  However, the most compelling aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  consideration  is  still  the   necessity   to\r\n\r\nconserve  our scarce earth resources.  It is not an immediate\r\n\r\nproblem.   It  is  often designated as low priority  concern.\r\n\r\nBut  with  the population growing at a staggering  rate  each\r\n\r\nyear,  very soon most of our resources will be depleted,  and\r\n\r\nwe cannot just pass this problem on to our next generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other equally important consideration is that\r\n\r\nrecycling  can  be  a  significant way to  lessen  our  waste\r\n\r\ndisposal  problem.   I think many Members have  already  made\r\n\r\nthat clear.  It is time for us to rethink some\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the practices in our daily life.  For example, the use of\r\n\r\ndisposable  utensils  or products made of  polystyrene,  PVC,\r\n\r\nplastic  or such bio-undegradable materials which  cannot  be\r\n\r\nrecycled  should  be minimised.  Perhaps we  should  consider\r\n\r\nbringing  back  the old practice of using reusable  utensils,\r\n\r\neven  at  the expense of having to put up with a  little  bit\r\n\r\nmore  inconvenience.   I would suggest the  Ministry  promote\r\n\r\nmore  awareness  on the importance of recycling,  spread  the\r\n\r\nmessage that even though it may not be cost effective in  the\r\n\r\nshort  term,  it  is  essential if we  are  to  preserve  our\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  resources and help  towards  resolving  our\r\n\r\nwaste disposal problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to go into details of ways and means\r\n\r\nof   re-instituting  the  various  recycling   possibilities,\r\n\r\nbecause there are so many.  But I would like the Minister  to\r\n\r\npromote more recycling initiatives and perhaps introduce some\r\n\r\nform   of   incentives  to  those  individuals  as  well   as\r\n\r\ncorporations who take recycling seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as I share\r\n\r\nmany of the concerns of the previous speakers, I will try  to\r\n\r\nreduce  my  points.   I  share the perception  that  we  have\r\n\r\nreached a limit to technical solutions.  We have built  Pulau\r\n\r\nSemakau,  a  world's first.  We are going  to  build  another\r\n\r\nincinerator   and these are big ticket items in  the  budget.\r\n\r\nBut  beyond  solutions, we will need to look at the  mindsets\r\n\r\nand  social  habits of Singaporeans.  Here, I would  disagree\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Kenneth Chen who spoke just before me.  I  actually\r\n\r\nthink  that  the  Ministry has done  a  good  job  in  making\r\n\r\ncitizens generally aware of the problem and aware of the need\r\n\r\nfor  recycling.   Of course, more can be done for  awareness.\r\n\r\nBut  the  next step we have to take is to move from awareness\r\n\r\nto  action.  We have to enable action by making it  easy,  by\r\n\r\nallowing enterprise and making our effort effective.  What  I\r\n\r\nmean  by  ease,  enterprise  and  effectiveness  goes  beyond\r\n\r\ncampaigns  or once in a while collecting old phone  books  or\r\n\r\nnewspapers.   We  need  to  have  regular  projects  in  each\r\n\r\nneighbourhood\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  even  in each house.  We see in many developed  countries\r\n\r\nblue bins or other systems used to collect bottles, cans  and\r\n\r\nother recyclables.  I am afraid I cannot understand why we do\r\n\r\nnot have the same.  I believe we should.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing about enterprise connects to the\r\n\r\nprivatisation  of  waste collection.  This  is  going  to  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  because eventually we are going to have  to  raise\r\n\r\nprices.   We can, however, do this in a way that is sensitive\r\n\r\r\nto  the  needs of people, because we cannot move house,  just\r\n\r\nbecause  one company charges more than the other  to  collect\r\n\r\nour  rubbish.  In that sense, it is a very imperfect  market,\r\n\r\neven  if  we  privatise.  What  we can do to make the  market\r\n\r\nbetter  is  to create more volume, not just by mandating  it.\r\n\r\nWe  should create a market.  Deposits on cans and bottles are\r\n\r\na  very small example of the kind of clear incentives we need\r\n\r\nto  create  this  market,  and then  create  the  volume  for\r\n\r\nrecycling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more generally, I think there are many other things\r\n\r\nwe  can learn from other societies.  We are not the first  to\r\n\r\nface  this problem, though it is more acute in Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like the Minister to share his thoughts with us  about\r\n\r\nclosing the loop on waste.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Members\r\n\r\nfor  speaking on recycling.  As mentioned by Mr Kenneth Chen,\r\n\r\nwaste  generation  in Singapore is on the  increase.   Twenty\r\n\r\nyears  ago, we produced about 2,500 tons of solid waste every\r\n\r\nday.   Ten  years ago, the amount doubled to 5,700  tons  and\r\n\r\nlast year, as mentioned by Mr Kenneth Chen, it has gone up by\r\n\r\nanother  35%  over the 10 years, to 7,600  tons.   The  split\r\n\r\nbetween  the  domestic  sector and the industrial  sector  is\r\n\r\nabout 50:50.  In other words, every person in Singapore today\r\n\r\ngenerates about 0.93 kilogram of solid waste every year.   If\r\n\r\nwe were to compare ourselves to, say, USA, it is still lower.\r\n\r\nIn USA, it is 1.97 kilograms; Germany, 1.26 kilograms; Japan,\r\n\r\n1.09  kilograms.  The good news is that compared to  many  of\r\n\r\nthe other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries,  we are still producing less than them.   But  the\r\n\r\nbad news is that Singapore, being a small country, faces much\r\n\r\ngreater challenge and constraint  -  in finding enough  space\r\n\r\nto  dispose  waste.  As mentioned by the Members, every  five\r\n\r\nyears,  we need to build a new incineration plant.  Every  30\r\n\r\nyears,  we  need  to find a landfill site as big  as  Sentosa\r\n\r\nisland.  Obviously, this is not sustainable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, I mentioned that in order to achieve\r\n\r\nsustainability  in the disposal of solid waste,  we  need  to\r\n\r\naccord  greater emphasis to waste minimisation.  And I  thank\r\n\r\nthe Members for speaking up and for their support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked why do we not focus\r\n\r\nmore  on 3Rs  -  reuse, reduce and recycle. Sir, I agree with\r\n\r\nhim  fully.  Since 1991, the Ministry of the Environment  has\r\n\r\nbeen promoting 3Rs very proactively.  There are 130 companies\r\n\r\nin  the  3Rs  industry, and they deal with a  whole  host  of\r\n\r\nrecycling:  wood  waste, paper, scrap  tyres,  copper  slabs,\r\n\r\nmarine clay and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also promote the fourth R, which is recovery. For\r\n\r\nexample, all our incineration plants today recover heat  from\r\n\r\nincineration  of  waste, and we feed the electricity  to  the\r\n\r\nnational grid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Prof. Low Seow Chay asked what happens to all\r\n\r\nthese   materials  collected  for  recycling.   Sir,   as   I\r\n\r\nmentioned, the rate of recycling in Singapore today  is  40%.\r\n\r\nOf  the wastes that are being collected for recycling,  about\r\n\r\n50%  are recycled in Singapore, and 50% for export.  For  the\r\n\r\n50% recycled in Singapore, waste paper is recycled into paper\r\n\r\nproducts such as cardboards, and toilet papers.  In the  case\r\n\r\nof  wood waste, companies are turning it into chip boards for\r\n\r\nfurniture, wooden panels and so on.  We are now using  marine\r\n\r\nclay  to make bricks for construction.  In fact, HDB will  be\r\n\r\nusing  some of these bricks produced by one of our  recycling\r\n\r\ncompanies.  So, on the whole, we think that 40% of  recycling\r\n\r\nrate is not bad.  If we compare ourselves to the rest of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  in  Germany, Munich city is 42%;   Netherlands,  39%.\r\n\r\nHowever, the rate of recycling has stabilised at 40%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince 1996, meaning that since 1996 we have not been able  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  rate of recycling in Singapore.  Therein  lies\r\n\r\nour real challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, Mr Heng Chiang Meng said that we should\r\n\r\nencourage  further recycling.  I agree with him  because  our\r\n\r\nchallenge  today  is  to achieve another breakthrough  beyond\r\n\r\nthis  40%  recycling rate.  Mr Simon Tay mentioned  that  the\r\n\r\nprivatisation  of  waste incineration  would  not  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem, in terms of sustainability.  I agree with  him.   We\r\n\r\nbelieve that privatisation would only enhance our performance\r\n\r\nin the short term.  But for long-term sustainability, we have\r\n\r\nto  go beyond that.  And that is the reason why yesterday,  I\r\n\r\nannounced  that the ENV has set a target of achieving  a  50%\r\n\r\nrecycling  rate over the next 10 years.  Sir,  I  must  admit\r\n\r\nthat this is not an easy target to achieve.  But we think  it\r\n\r\ncan  be done.  It is doable if all of us work harder together\r\n\r\nto achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng asked whether the Government is\r\n\r\ntrying  to pass the buck to the private sector.  I can assure\r\n\r\nthe  House that that is not the intention.  We look  at  this\r\n\r\nchallenge  as a shared challenge of the three \"P\" sectors   - the Government, the private sector and the people sector.  It\r\n\r\nis  a common challenge facing all of us.  So we are going  to\r\n\r\nwork  together.   We are not going to pass the  buck  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the recycling rates for paper, plastic,\r\n\r\nconstruction debris and book wastes range from  10%  to  60%.\r\n\r\nWe  examine  each of these items and our assessment  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  enough  scope for all of us to  work  together  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  recycling rates for each  of  these  types  of\r\n\r\nwastes  by about 20 percentage points over the next 10 years.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  we believe that the 50% target is doable,  not\r\n\r\neasy but doable, if we work hard enough, if we work together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge really is how to extend recycling beyond\r\n\r\nthe industrial sector.  The 40% recycling today are basically\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieved  through  recycling by the  industrial  sector.   To\r\n\r\nextend  beyond  that  to the domestic sector  and  commercial\r\n\r\nsector,  we have to work both the supply and demand sides  of\r\n\r\nrecycling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen mentioned that we need to strengthen our\r\n\r\neducation on waste recycling and spread the message,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  to educate the young.  And Mr Simon Tay mentioned  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  go  beyond awareness and  turn  awareness  into\r\n\r\naction.  I agree with both of them.  For example, our  school\r\n\r\nchildren  today, at Primary 3, are told about the  importance\r\n\r\nof recycling.  My daughter came back from school one day when\r\n\r\nshe  was in Primary 3 and asked mummy and daddy, \"How can  we\r\n\r\nparticipate in recycling?\"  She also asked, \"Where is the bin\r\n\r\nfor  the  plastics and bottles?  Where is  the  bin  for  the\r\n\r\ncans?\"  I was very shy, pretended and said that there was  no\r\n\r\nsuch system in our home today.  The point is that after a few\r\n\r\nyears, my daughter never talks about recycling anymore.  Why?\r\n\r\nThe  awareness has not been turned into action.  There is  no\r\n\r\ncontinuous  reinforcement.  As a result, we are  not  reaping\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  all the effort we have put into  education.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the reason why ENV decided that we must now require\r\n\r\nall  the public waste collectors to introduce waste recycling\r\n\r\nto  every  household in Singapore so that your  daughter,  my\r\n\r\ndaughter,  your son, my son, after coming home  from  school,\r\n\r\nhaving learned about recycling, hopefully, they will be  able\r\n\r\nto practise recycling on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our contractual agreement with these nine public\r\n\r\nwaste collectors, they are required by ENV to introduce waste\r\n\r\nrecycling  schemes and bring recycling to the  door-steps  of\r\n\r\nthe  residents.  We believe this will make it easier for each\r\n\r\nand every household to participate in waste recycling.  I  am\r\n\r\npleased  to inform the House that Jurong sector will  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to  launch the scheme by April next month.  The  other\r\n\r\nsectors will do so by the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for recycling at the commercial premises, as\r\n\r\nmentioned  by Mr Simon Tay, I agree with him.  In fact,  this\r\n\r\nis another\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchallenge  that  we have to overcome.  In  the  case  of  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  premises,  we  are going  to  reach  out  to  the\r\n\r\nbuilding   managements   to  encourage   as   many   building\r\n\r\nmanagements  as  possible  in Singapore  to  introduce  waste\r\n\r\nrecycling in our commercial buildings.  Hopefully, over time,\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  able to spread recycling beyond the  industrial\r\n\r\nsector to the domestic and commercial sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having taken action on the supply side, we are also\r\n\r\ntaking  action on the demand side, meaning that we are  going\r\n\r\nto  step  up  our  promotion effort to  further  develop  the\r\n\r\nrecycling  industry in Singapore.  Our aim is  to  nurture  a\r\n\r\nvibrant   recycling  industry  in  Singapore   and   position\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a leading centre of excellence in  4Rs  (reuse,\r\n\r\nreduce, recycle and recover) in this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng yesterday mentioned that maybe we\r\n\r\nshould introduce more incentives to encourage recycling,  and\r\n\r\ntoday  he  mentioned  that we ought to  do  more  to  promote\r\n\r\n\"reduce\" and \"reuse\".  Sir, as I said, I agree with him.   We\r\n\r\nare  now looking at the experience of other countries and see\r\n\r\nin  what  way we can learn from them.  I am going to  make  a\r\n\r\ntrip  to  Europe in May and US sometime in July.  The purpose\r\n\r\nis  to see how we can learn from  these countries on how they\r\n\r\nare   able  to  implement  recycling  more  effectively  than\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to inform the House that we have set\r\n\r\nup  a  multi-agency task force.  It is led by EDB, comprising\r\n\r\nmembers  from  ENV, JTC and PSB.  This task force,  over  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  months, is going to formulate further our industry\r\n\r\ndevelopment  strategies.   They  are  going  to  propose  new\r\n\r\nincentives,  where  necessary,  to  support  and  assist  the\r\n\r\nindustry in its development.  At the same time, we will  work\r\n\r\ntogether to nurture more companies, promote more investments,\r\n\r\nto  build new capabilities and capacities in our industry for\r\n\r\nthe 4Rs and, hopefully, in the process, we are going to speed\r\n\r\nup the pace of innovation in the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Low suggested that we should impose recycled\r\n\r\ncontents in our Government procurement programme.  I think we\r\n\r\nhave to be pragmatic here.  In the case of Singapore, many of\r\n\r\nour   industries  and  manufacturers  are  basically   global\r\n\r\ncompanies producing for the global market.  So, in a way, our\r\n\r\nindustry  is  basically  an  export-oriented  industry.   Our\r\n\r\ndomestic market is a very small one.  Therefore, we feel that\r\n\r\nto  use  our domestic market as a lever to enforce  recycling\r\n\r\ncontents  in manufactured products may not be effective.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  it  may also affect our competitiveness  in\r\n\r\nattracting foreign direct investment.  We are not comfortable\r\n\r\nto  insist such a regulation because the global manufacturers\r\n\r\nmay  also  be  constrained  by the availability  of  recycled\r\n\r\ncomponents.  Instead of requiring them to do so, what we  are\r\n\r\ntrying to do is to create the condition in Singapore to  make\r\n\r\nit  attractive for them to do so.  We believe that this  will\r\n\r\nbe the kind of win-win outcome we can strive for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether the Government can help to\r\n\r\nmake  the  recycled  products more  attractive  in  terms  of\r\n\r\npricing  and  to  label  these recycled  products.   To  make\r\n\r\nrecycled products more attractive is a very good idea.  It is\r\n\r\nsomething  I  fully agree.  I spoke to many of our  recycling\r\n\r\ncompanies.  I asked them, \"What is your strategy in competing\r\n\r\nfor  market share?\"  They said that their strategy is to sell\r\n\r\ntheir  products  cheaper  than the  non-recyclable  products.\r\n\r\nHowever,  they said that their cost of production is  higher.\r\n\r\nWith a higher cost of production, how to compete on the basis\r\n\r\nof   low  prices?   Therefore,  they  asked  me  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could come in to subsidise or offset this  higher\r\n\r\ncost of operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this approach may not be sustainable\r\n\r\nbecause  it  would  not  be possible for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to subsidise the recycling industry.  But we believe\r\n\r\nthat  there is a lot of scope for us to speed up the  process\r\n\r\nof  innovation in our recycling industry so that the industry\r\n\r\ncan  come out with more innovative products that can  command\r\n\r\nmore  attractive pricing in the market.  In this regard, ENV,\r\n\r\nEDB and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  various  Government agencies are going  to  work  closer\r\n\r\ntogether  to support the industry through the IDS (Innovation\r\n\r\nDevelopment Scheme), whereby we are going to co-fund the cost\r\n\r\nof   developing   new   products,  new  processes   and   new\r\n\r\napplications of these recycled materials.  In the process,  I\r\n\r\nthink we would be able to help them to become more viable and\r\n\r\nmore profitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding labelling the recycled products, the Singapore\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Council has this Green Label scheme  in  place.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  can  do is to work closer with them to  incorporate\r\n\r\nthis  concept, as proposed by Prof. Low Seow Chay,  into  the\r\n\r\nGreen  Label scheme, and maybe to work with SEC to conduct  a\r\n\r\ncampaign to create greater public awareness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen also asked whether we should review the\r\n\r\nuse  of  disposable crockery that are non-biodegradable.   In\r\n\r\nthe  short term, what we are trying to do is to generate both\r\n\r\nthe  demand and supply sides.  Because if we are not able  to\r\n\r\ncreate the demand for the recyclable waste, at the end of the\r\n\r\nday, whether the waste is biodegradable or non-biodegradable,\r\n\r\nif  they  all  end up in the incineration plant, it  actually\r\n\r\nmakes  no difference.  In that sense, while I note the  point\r\n\r\nby  Mr Kenneth Chen, I would say that the challenge really is\r\n\r\nto  find a way to recycle these wastes.  Because, if there is\r\n\r\na way of using them, then I think it makes a lot of sense for\r\n\r\nus to move away from wastes that are non-biodegradable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed all the questions by\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, our\r\n\r\nexpressways  cut  across many high-rise  public  and  private\r\n\r\nhousing estates in Singapore, especially in the central area.\r\n\r\nOver  the years, traffic has increased in our expressways  in\r\n\r\nthe  city  area and the outlying areas.  Also, many residents\r\n\r\nfind that this has caused significant noise problems for them\r\n\r\nand their families not only in the day time, but also as late\r\n\r\nas  10.00  pm, 11.00 pm and 12 midnight.  Many find that  the\r\n\r\nnoise pollution is unbearable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of my residents live in flats very close to\r\n\r\nthese  expressways.  In fact, some of these flats were  built\r\n\r\nway  before  the expressways, like CTE and PIE,  were  built.\r\n\r\nDue  to  the  lack  of  space for the construction  of  these\r\n\r\nexpressways, some of these expressways cut very close to  the\r\n\r\nflats.   For  example, I know of one or two flats in  Whampoa\r\n\r\nDrive area where they do not normally meet the URA's set-back\r\n\r\nguidelines, for instance, so much so that when one  of  these\r\n\r\nflats went through a Main Upgrading Programme, the SAI (space-adding  item), which was supposed to be built, could  not  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  because the expressway is so close.  That is how close\r\n\r\nsome of these flats are to the expressways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry to seriously look into\r\n\r\nthis.   Residents, especially living probably  six  or  seven\r\n\r\nstoreys  above, are the ones who feel the greatest impact  of\r\n\r\nthis noise pollution.  I am also aware that those flats which\r\n\r\nare  near  the  MRT  tracks also face this  similar  problem,\r\n\r\nalthough  those from the traffic of the expressways  is  even\r\n\r\ngreater.  I understand that countries, like Japan, have built\r\n\r\nsound barriers at strategic spots in their expressways.  I am\r\n\r\nnot  asking that these be built across Singapore in  all  the\r\n\r\nexpressways but at strategic points where the impact of  this\r\n\r\nis felt by most residents.  I know that there have been talks\r\n\r\nthat  this would not be aesthetically doable by some  of  the\r\n\r\nurban  planners.  But I think if it is functional and it  can\r\n\r\nhelp many residents, it would certainly be useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in particular, I have got several residents who\r\n\r\nhave  told  me  that they have to put up with this  for  many\r\n\r\nyears  and,  in  fact,  they found  that  their  hearing  has\r\n\r\nactually  been  impaired  and they  have  to  get  help  from\r\n\r\ndoctors.  So I think it is a significant problem and  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Ministry will look into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the topic I wish to\r\n\r\ntalk about is hand, foot and mouth disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finding of the recent hand, foot and mouth disease\r\n\r\nepidemic was related to the EV71 Enterovirus.  At the peak of\r\n\r\nthe epidemic, there were more than 400 cases\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreported  a month and some children died of the disease.   In\r\n\r\nOctober  last  year, drastic action was taken  to  break  the\r\n\r\nchain of transmission of the epidemic.  After things got back\r\n\r\nto  normal,  in  late last month and early  this  month,  the\r\n\r\ndisease  started  again.  About 100 cases were  reported  per\r\n\r\nmonth, and two children had died as a result.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, EV71 infected hand, foot and mouth disease has\r\n\r\nproven  to  be quite lethal.  In the outbreak in Malaysia  in\r\n\r\n1997,  47  deaths were suspected to be due to the hand,  foot\r\n\r\nand  mouth  disease.  In the outbreak in Taiwan in  1998,  at\r\n\r\nleast  the deaths of 80 children were implicated to be caused\r\n\r\nby   EV71  Enterovirus,  and  more  than  60,000  cases  were\r\n\r\nreported.  We were lucky that here the damage due to the EV71\r\n\r\nwas not as bad as other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-emergence of the EV71 epidemic in the beginning\r\n\r\nof  this month prompted one to ask whether the measures taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry are effective enough to take care  of  this\r\n\r\ndeadly epidemic.  In the first place, is the reporting system\r\n\r\nof  the hand, foot and mouth disease cases by the GPs to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  quick  enough?  Could it be that by  the  time  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  gathered  all  the data, the  disease  has  already\r\n\r\nspread?  I tried to find out some data or information of  the\r\n\r\ndisease  from  the  Internet  and  I  got  nothing  from  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  web-page on how to prevent and control the  spread\r\n\r\nof  the  disease.  It shows that some efforts should  be  put\r\n\r\ninto  the  web  and other media to help the  control  of  the\r\n\r\ndisease.   Should we do more in public education so that  the\r\n\r\npeople are well aware of the danger of the disease and,  when\r\n\r\ncontracted,  they know precisely what to do  to  contain  the\r\n\r\nspread of the disease?\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago, when a person contracted a communicable\r\n\r\ndisease,  he will be kept in the Communicable Disease  Centre\r\n\r\nto  prevent its possible spread.  I have not heard about such\r\n\r\nmeasure  for  quite some time.  Should we rethink  about  the\r\n\r\nmatter and see whether it is feasible to confine\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople contacted with the EV71, hand, foot and mouth disease,\r\n\r\nas a means to contain that disease?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you want to move on to your next\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the next cut is odour\r\n\r\ncontrol.   In the previous year's debate in the Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply,  I  spoke about the necessity of the smell  or  odour\r\n\r\ncontrol regulation.  The reply from the Minister was that  if\r\n\r\nit  affects  the public health, then it could  be  controlled\r\n\r\nunder  the  Environmental Public Health Regulations.   Though\r\n\r\nsaying  so, nothing much seems to have been done in improving\r\n\r\nthe environment in the area of odour or smell in the air that\r\n\r\nis discomforting to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an odour standard, it is very difficult for the\r\n\r\npeople  to  complain about the foul smell and the  industries\r\n\r\nthat  generate the chemicals which cause the  smell.   It  is\r\n\r\nalso  very  difficult for the Ministry to say who  is  wrong,\r\n\r\nsimply  because there is no law to say that it is illegal  to\r\n\r\ngenerate the smell.  At present, anyone who is unhappy  about\r\n\r\nsomething  smelly,  he  will just make  a  complaint  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  The Ministry will then go to the source  and  tell\r\n\r\nthe person not to generate the smell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reality, zero emission standard is only\r\n\r\napplicable  to the hazardous and toxic emission  of  harmless\r\n\r\nsmell.   It may seem too much if we tell the source to comply\r\n\r\nwith zero emission.  To be reasonable, we need to set a limit\r\n\r\nto  such emission and a standard would then be needed.   Take\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the smelly bean curd shop chou  tou  fu.   The\r\n\r\ncomplaint of the smell led to the closure of the premises.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  the  authority has used other laws to  request  the\r\n\r\nstoppage  of the business and, certainly, it was not  because\r\n\r\nof  the  smell level that had been complained about.  In  the\r\n\r\nrecent  well-reported case about the smell from  the  chicken\r\n\r\nfarm  and  from  organic  farming  using  animal  wastes  and\r\n\r\nfertiliser,  even the consultant from the NUS  did  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat standard would be acceptable, in terms of smell.  If one\r\n\r\ncould  not set a standard, how could one know that the farmer\r\n\r\nhas done his job in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrolling  the smell, the people may have a sensitive  nose\r\n\r\nto  smell  even  though  it is of a  very  low  and  harmless\r\n\r\ncontent.   The consequence would be to either close  all  the\r\n\r\nfarms or resettle all the people from the affected areas.  If\r\n\r\nthis  is  the solution, it would be very unfortunate  and  it\r\n\r\nwill certainly insult the intelligence of many people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before things get from bad to worse due to arguments and\r\n\r\ncounter-arguments about the problem of smell, it is time that\r\n\r\nwe  should  at  least set up some standards in  dealing  with\r\n\r\nsmell,  so  that both the emitter and receiver  will  have  a\r\n\r\ncommon ground in settling their problem of smell or odour.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, I will be dealing with the\r\n\r\nquestions  posed by Mr Sinnakaruppan and Prof.  Low  on  HFMD\r\n\r\nand, of course, the last one on control of smell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sinnakaruppan asked about traffic noise. Let me\r\n\r\nassure him that traffic noise comes from vehicle engines  and\r\n\r\ntyres.   ENV,  MCIT  and  MND have  implemented  measures  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  traffic  noises  from expressways.   These  measures\r\n\r\ninclude  setting  of noise emission standards  for  vehicles;\r\n\r\nusing low noise porous asphalt material for surfacing certain\r\n\r\nstretches  of  expressways; siting  multi-storey  car  parks,\r\n\r\nelectrical   substations   or   other   non-noise   sensitive\r\n\r\nstructures   to   screen  traffic  noise   from   residential\r\n\r\nbuildings;  setting  back  residential  buildings  from   the\r\n\r\nexpressways; and designing layout of flats such  that  living\r\n\r\nrooms and bedrooms are located away from traffic noise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increased urbanisation and widening of\r\n\r\nexpressways,  the noise level has gradually  been  increasing\r\n\r\nalong certain stretches of the expressways.  To address  this\r\n\r\ngradual  increase of traffic noise from expressways, ENV  and\r\n\r\nMCIT  engaged  a noise consultant to conduct a study  on  the\r\n\r\nimpact of traffic noise from expressways.  The study includes\r\n\r\na  review of the existing guidelines and mitigation measures,\r\n\r\nincluding sound barriers.  In the preliminary findings of the\r\n\r\nstudy, the consultants have also identified several\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'hot  spots'.   These  are  blocks  of  flats  fronting   the\r\n\r\nexpressways where the noise level is high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV and MCIT will evaluate the findings and\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the consultancy study.  We would also look\r\n\r\ninto   noise  mitigation  measures  from  these  'hot  spots'\r\n\r\nespecially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land scarce and highly urbanised Singapore, some\r\n\r\ndegree  of  noise  pollution is inevitable.   Notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthis,  we would seek to minimise the impact of traffic  noise\r\n\r\non  residents  living near expressways  through  the  use  of\r\n\r\nplanning and other noise mitigation measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Low asked about HFM disease. My Ministry\r\n\r\nappreciates his concern.  We are also concerned.  In response\r\n\r\nto  Prof. Low's questions and, with your permission,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to put in perspective the overall situation  with\r\n\r\nregard to infant fatality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from September last year to now, there were seven\r\n\r\nchildren  below  5 years of age who died of viral  infections\r\n\r\ninvolving the brain, lungs and heart.  Four had EV71 and  one\r\n\r\nhad  an enterovirus that is still being typed.  The virus  or\r\n\r\nviruses   responsible  for  the  other  two  could   not   be\r\n\r\nidentified.  In the last five years, there were an average of\r\n\r\n16  deaths  a  year,  ranging from 11  to  28  deaths,  among\r\n\r\nchildren  aged 5 and below.  This puts us among  one  of  the\r\n\r\nlowest mortality rate among children of this age group in the\r\n\r\nworld.   What  is  worth noting is that  there  has  been  no\r\n\r\nnoticeable  increase in the number of deaths  among  children\r\n\r\naged  5  and below in recent years.  In fact, the  number  of\r\n\r\ndeaths  last  year, among children in this particular  group,\r\n\r\ntotalled 11.  And this was less than the previous year  which\r\n\r\nwas 18.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why then has there been this recent attention given\r\n\r\nto   EV71?   For  one  thing,  it  was  only  recently   that\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in the diagnostic tool, known as PCR,  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  to do with the laboratory equipment that magnifies\r\n\r\nthe  DNA,  the genes of the virus using an enzyme,  known  as\r\n\r\npolymerase,   has  enabled  it  to  be  used  by   diagnostic\r\n\r\nlaboratories worldwide to detect EV71.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then how does EV71 relate to HFMD? Is it a potentially\r\n\r\naggressive virus that often causes deaths?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, EV71 is generally not known to be an aggressive\r\n\r\nvirus.  In most cases, EV71 will not cause death, but instead\r\n\r\ncause  a mild and common childhood disease known as the hand,\r\n\r\nfoot and mouth disease.  It is just like the flu virus.   The\r\n\r\nflu  virus does not usually attack the heart or the brain and\r\n\r\nthen  cause death, although it can and has been known  to  do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when will EV71 turn aggressive and lethal? The\r\n\r\noutcome  would depend on the relationship between  the  viral\r\n\r\nagent  and the host, the baby, the kid.  For example, factors\r\n\r\nlike  the  amount  of virus a person is  exposed  to  or  the\r\n\r\nability  of  the body's immune system to defend  against  the\r\n\r\nvirus  can  make a difference.  Genetic factors also  play  a\r\n\r\npart,  some persons may possess a certain gene which  renders\r\n\r\nthem  more prone to complications by allowing efficient virus\r\n\r\nentry into the cells.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since one of the symptoms of EV71 is hand, foot and\r\n\r\nmouth disease, a good strategy to prevent the spread of  EV71\r\n\r\nis  to  prevent  an  outbreak of the  hand,  foot  and  mouth\r\n\r\ndisease.   We  are not saying that EV71 cannot be  aggressive\r\n\r\nwhen  there is no HFMD outbreak, as we have seen it can,  but\r\n\r\npreventing  outbreaks of HFMD would minimise  the  chance  of\r\n\r\nexposure to EV71 virus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry therefore monitors very closely the\r\n\r\nincidence of HFMD throughout Singapore and, in particular, in\r\n\r\nall  the  pre-schools.   If  there  are  signs  of  localised\r\n\r\nsecondary transmission going on in any pre-school,  ENV  will\r\n\r\nmove in quickly to prevent an outbreak from occurring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the months ahead, ENV will be working with MOE and\r\n\r\nMCDS  to  see  how best pre-school operators can  be  further\r\n\r\ntrained in the areas of illness detection, isolation  of  the\r\n\r\nunwell child and preventive measures to check transmission.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sidek, \"guillotine\" time on this\r\n\r\namendment is 1.40 pm.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Yes.

There are\r\n\r\ncurrently  no  standards for odour emission from  industries,\r\n\r\nincluding  poultry farms.  This is because  most  odours  are\r\n\r\nmade up of many organic compounds that cannot be detected  by\r\n\r\ninstrument.  Sir, our nose is still the best means to  assess\r\n\r\nan odour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, panels comprising selective individuals have been\r\n\r\nset  up  in  some cases to assess odour.  However, the  panel\r\n\r\nmembers  still use their noses to detect odour.    There  are\r\n\r\nodours  and  there are odours.  We should only  be  concerned\r\n\r\nwith  odours that have health implications or are a  nuisance\r\n\r\nto  many.  Odour emissions from chicken farms, pharmaceutical\r\n\r\nand  food industries, etc, are some examples.  In such cases,\r\n\r\nwe   would  require  industries  to  install  odour   control\r\n\r\nequipment to reduce the odour emission.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The hawker\r\n\r\ncentre  is  one of the most frequented places for  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  when  they go for food, because it is  inexpensive\r\n\r\nand  there is a great variety of food.  It has become one  of\r\n\r\nthe  essential parts of daily living of our people.  With the\r\n\r\nconvenience  and good choices of food in the  hawker  centre,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have, unconsciously, developed a habit of eating\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from hawker centres, there are also more and more\r\n\r\nfood courts now coming to the HDB estates.  If we compare the\r\n\r\nhawker  centre  with  the food court, of  course  the  hawker\r\n\r\ncentre  would be inferior, as far as appearance,  decoration,\r\n\r\nambience and the level of comfort are concerned.  So, when we\r\n\r\nupgrade our hawker centres, we should not just stick  to  the\r\n\r\nold  fashioned way of doing it, ie, just cleaning,  painting,\r\n\r\nand  putting  in some new tables and chairs.     I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  redesign  the hawker centres with better  lay-out  of\r\n\r\nstalls, comfortable seats, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngenerally  more  pleasant environment.    We  should  have  a\r\n\r\nthorough change, so that a modern hawker centre would attract\r\n\r\ncustomers,  whether in its outlook or comfort  comparable  to\r\n\r\nthe food courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the ageing of our people, we notice that there\r\n\r\nare many hawkers at the hawker centres who are old enough  to\r\n\r\nretire.   We  could  notice in certain hawker  centres  where\r\n\r\nbusiness  is not well, some stalls are not open,  while  some\r\n\r\nstalls  are  operating for only a few  hours  a  day.    Some\r\n\r\nelderly  hawkers  find it too tough to carry  on  with  their\r\n\r\ntrade and rent out their stalls to other people.  The hawkers\r\n\r\nmay  be  aging  but their stalls still have  economic  value.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Ministry of the Environment should allow  these\r\n\r\nold  hawkers  who  have  been operating  for  many  years  to\r\n\r\nsurrender  their stalls to the Government for  some  form  of\r\n\r\ncompensation,  so that these stalls could be  transferred  to\r\n\r\nwilling new-comers, to better serve the customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development has already\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  it  will be compensating  any  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nretailer who wants to give up his shop with $48,000.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  the  Environment  could  also  offer   an\r\n\r\nattractive package to anyone who wishes to give up his stall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgrading of a hawker centre may take as long as one\r\n\r\nyear.   Some hawkers may not have enough savings to last  for\r\n\r\nsuch  a long period without income.  I wonder if the Ministry\r\n\r\nof the Environment could make some arrangements to help them.\r\n\r\nAre  the  stallholders required to pay their  rent  when  the\r\n\r\nhawker centre is being upgraded, and no business is conducted\r\n\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of some of the hawker centres, eg, the one in\r\n\r\nTaman  Jurong Block 1, is very old fashioned.  No matter  how\r\n\r\nwe upgrade, it would not be nice and presentable.  Perhaps we\r\n\r\nshould  build a new hawker centre nearby so that the  hawkers\r\n\r\ncan  continue to operate in the existing hawker  centre,  and\r\n\r\nthen  move  into the new hawker centre when it is  completed.\r\n\r\nIn this way, they will not be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeprived of the earnings during the period of upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof Low, would you like to give some\r\n\r\ntime to the other two persons?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know, first of all, after  the  centres  are\r\n\r\nupgraded, whether the rental will be increased and,  as  Prof\r\n\r\nLow  has  asked, whether any compensation would be  given  to\r\n\r\ntide  the  hawkers  over  the  difficult  period  during  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  process.   How long does the  Ministry  expect  to\r\n\r\nupgrade all the hawker centres in Singapore, and what is  the\r\n\r\nschedule of the proposed upgrading?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, over the last few\r\n\r\ndays,  we  have heard that the Government has  come  up  with\r\n\r\nschemes  to help HDB shop retailers.  There is one  group  of\r\n\r\nretailers  who  needs help, and I think  this  has  not  been\r\n\r\naddressed.  I am referring to those stall owners operating in\r\n\r\nwet  markets  managed by the Ministry of the Environment.   I\r\n\r\nhave one such market in my constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will recall that in the mid 1990s, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  encouraged ownership of wet  market  stalls,  and\r\n\r\nstallholders in these markets volunteered to buy their stalls\r\n\r\nover   from  the  Government,  and  they  did  so.   However,\r\n\r\nlifestyles  have changed and, over the last  five  years,  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen  a shift in preference, with households preferring\r\n\r\nto  shop in air-conditioned supermarkets and suburban  malls.\r\n\r\nAs a result, many of these wet market stall owners are facing\r\n\r\nfalling  business, and the fall seems to be permanent  rather\r\n\r\nthan  cyclical, and many are also carrying very high mortgage\r\n\r\nrates, which they find difficult to sustain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not sure whether the Retail 21 Committee has\r\n\r\naddressed  these  stall  owners' problems.   Many  are  in  a\r\n\r\ndilemma.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy  nature  of their wet market environment, they  have  less\r\n\r\nflexibility.  They cannot easily sublet part of their stalls,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  stalls themselves are very small.  Neither  can\r\n\r\nthey  change  their  use, nor apply productivity  enhancement\r\n\r\nmeasures  to upgrade.  They offered to sell their  stalls  in\r\n\r\nthe resale market, but there were no takers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three proposals for the Minister to try to\r\n\r\nsolve this problem:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Allow these stall owners to set up a cooperative to\r\n\r\nremodel  their  wet  market  stalls  into  a  viable   modern\r\n\r\nsupermarket.  In so doing, the Government undertakes to  help\r\n\r\nredevelop the wet market into a modern style supermarket, and\r\n\r\nlet the stall operators manage and operate the supermarket;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Implement something like the SERS programme for\r\n\r\nresidential units, ie, the Government rebuild the wet  market\r\n\r\nand  allow stallholders to have a choice, whether to continue\r\n\r\nto  operate the stall when the market is rebuilt, or  totally\r\n\r\nsell their stalls back to Government;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If all the stallholders are willing to quit business\r\n\r\nand sell their stalls back to the Government at an acceptable\r\n\r\nprice,  the  Government should consider buying back  all  the\r\n\r\nstalls, tear down the market, and use it for something else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am urging the Minister to address this problem\r\n\r\nand help our wet market stall owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chng is not moving. Mr Lim Swee Say.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, as time is short, I will go\r\n\r\ndirectly to the points brought up by the various Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the issue of whether we will allow some\r\n\r\nflexibility in the design of the upgrading of centres.   Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  happy to say that what the Ministry will do  is  this.\r\n\r\nFor  upgrading, we will assign a standard budget, on  a  per-stall  basis,  for  each  project.  The  grassroots  leaders,\r\n\r\nadvisers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  market  association can then decide  what  are  the\r\n\r\nadditional features and designs they would like to have.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, their design will be subject to approval by the  ENV,\r\n\r\nHDB  and  JTC who are the managing agents, and the additional\r\n\r\ncosts  of  these  features will be borne  by  the  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations and the Town Councils.  This means that we will\r\n\r\nprovide them with the standard package and standard fund, and\r\n\r\nthey can do the topping up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is there any programme to enable some of the\r\n\r\nstallholders to get out, if they do not want to move into the\r\n\r\nupgraded centre?  For the first-generation stallholders, they\r\n\r\nwill  be  given $19,000.  These cooked food stallholders  can\r\n\r\ntake the $19,000 and give up the stalls.  In the case of  the\r\n\r\nmarket  stalls, they will be offered a cash grant of $15,000.\r\n\r\nSo those who do not want to go into the upgraded centre, they\r\n\r\ncan  take the grant and leave.  But these are only for  those\r\n\r\ncentres  that are involved in redevelopment, ie,  if  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to reconfigure or redevelop the centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the centres that are only meant for upgrading,\r\n\r\nie,  no  structural change but just upgrading,  our  original\r\n\r\nintention  is  actually not to offer them these cash  grants.\r\n\r\nBut  a  few MPs have suggested that we should at least  allow\r\n\r\nsome  of them, in particular, the older ones, to get  out  if\r\n\r\nthey  want to.  So my Ministry has decided that we will offer\r\n\r\ncash  grants to those who are more than 62 years old  at  the\r\n\r\npoint  of announcement.  For example, if a centre is selected\r\n\r\nfor upgrading - not for redevelopment but for upgrading - all\r\n\r\nthe  stallholders who are more than 62 years old can opt  for\r\n\r\nthese cash grants, if they want to.  Whereas in the case of a\r\n\r\nmajor  redevelopment, the cash grants will be offered to  all\r\n\r\nstallholders, regardless of their age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question on whether there will be any change in\r\n\r\nrental  after the upgrading, Sir, firstly, subsidised  stalls\r\n\r\nin  all  centres pay a standardised base rate.  For  example,\r\n\r\nfor a cooked food stall, today it is $160.  In the case of  a\r\n\r\nmarket  stall, it is between $56 and $92.  All centres  today\r\n\r\npay these base rates.  These base rates are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreviewed  from time to time.  The last time we  reviewed  the\r\n\r\nrental  was in 1995, some 6-7 years ago.  But I am  happy  to\r\n\r\ninform  the House that my Ministry has no intention, at  this\r\n\r\nmoment, to revise the rental, meaning that there will  be  no\r\n\r\nchange  to  these  base  rate rentals  in  the  near  future.\r\n\r\nHowever, for those centres that have undergone both upgrading\r\n\r\nand  redevelopment,  there will be  some  adjustment  to  the\r\n\r\nrental, to reflect the better facilities, design, layout and,\r\n\r\nin some cases, even bigger stall size.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of centres. The first type is just\r\n\r\nupgrading, ie, no structural change, but upgrading  in  terms\r\n\r\nof  better tables, stools, toilets, ventilation system and so\r\n\r\non.   For those stalls, the adjustments will be very minimal.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  able to give the exact amounts, because the  sums\r\n\r\ninvolved will vary across centres, depending on the condition\r\n\r\nof the centre, its location, etc.  But as an indication, I am\r\n\r\npleased to inform the House that the adjustment to the rental\r\n\r\nfor the upgraded stalls will be between $1 and $4 a day.  So,\r\n\r\nwe are keeping it very minimal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A month or a day?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> A day. $1 to $4 a day, depending on\r\n\r\nthe  location, where they are.  For some centres, it will  be\r\n\r\n$1;  for some other centres, it could be as high as $4.  But,\r\n\r\non  the  average, it would be about $2, for the upgrading  of\r\n\r\nthe  stall.  If we do a simple calculation, we will find that\r\n\r\nit  will  not  be possible for the Government to recover  the\r\n\r\ncost of upgrading through this $2-per-day adjustment, because\r\n\r\nthe cost of upgrading is about $20,000 per stall.  So, at  $2\r\n\r\na  day,  it  will take us 10,000 days, or something  like  30\r\n\r\nyears, to recover.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

To strengthen the regulatory and institutional\r\n\r\nframework for the conservation of energy;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To improve the market environment so as to provide\r\n\r\nan improved platform for all to conserve energy; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To use the public sector as the leading edge and\r\n\r\nshow the way for all to emulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while these are good and admirable measures, I\r\n\r\nthink  a  very basic fundamental point is missed.  Energy  is\r\n\r\nused  by  humans  and, therefore, can only  be  conserved  by\r\n\r\nhumans.   Yet, the measures are not focused on  how  to  make\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as  a whole use less energy  as  a  behavioural\r\n\r\nnorm.   If every Singaporean can consciously use less  energy\r\n\r\nin  every  aspect  of his daily living, such  behaviour  will\r\n\r\ncarry over from his home to his workplace.  So, if each of us\r\n\r\ncan  conserve only a bit, the combined effects of  the  total\r\n\r\npopulation can lead to a huge decrease in energy usage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to really suggest that the Government\r\n\r\nstart encouraging more Singaporeans to conserve energy.   And\r\n\r\nI  am  very  sure the Acting Minister would agree  with  this\r\n\r\nmotherhood  statement.  Unfortunately,  the  example  of  the\r\n\r\nrecent  rebates given on the hybrid electric car, as well  as\r\n\r\nother  measures or lack of measures, does not give  one  hope\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government is prepared to put its money where its  mouth\r\n\r\nis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the use of any new technology is\r\n\r\nexpensive.

Also,  without  an\r\n\r\nextensive  infrastructure, motoring with a  hybrid  car  will\r\n\r\ncause more inconvenience for the owner.  And the rebates that\r\n\r\nhave  been  given so far do not take all these  factors  into\r\n\r\nconsideration, resulting in the estimated overall costs to be\r\n\r\nhigher  than  that of conventional cars, despite the  perhaps\r\n\r\ncheaper  initial cost of the vehicle.  It is, therefore,  not\r\n\r\nsurprising that most dealers do not expect a high demand  for\r\n\r\nthe hybrid cars, despite the rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Heng, would you like to give some time\r\n\r\nto Mr Thomas?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Yes, Sir, just one final point.\r\n\r\nYesterday, Mr Ong Kian Min brought up this question of  solar\r\n\r\nheating  panels.   I  have brought up this  issue  before  in\r\n\r\nprevious  Committee  of  Supply  debates,  and  I  wish   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will give some financial rebates on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am pleased\r\n\r\nto  say that most of the points that I had wanted to bring up\r\n\r\nhave  already  been  addressed by the Minister.   However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  just like to ask what are the acceptable international\r\n\r\nstandards  for  noise levels, in decibels, from  expressways,\r\n\r\nand what is the general noise level from our expressways?\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I agree with Mr Heng Chiang Meng\r\n\r\nthat  energy conservation can only be effective if  there  is\r\n\r\nenough  of public consciousness.  When I mentioned  that  ENV\r\n\r\nwould  take over the IACEC, effective from April, I did  also\r\n\r\nmention  that  we  are  going to  expand  the  scope  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee beyond energy conservation to include clean  energy\r\n\r\nas well.  At the same time, I want to assure Mr Heng that the\r\n\r\nCommittee would adopt a 3P partnership approach, meaning that\r\n\r\nwhatever programmes we introduce, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  strengthen the partnership between the  people,  public\r\n\r\nand  private sectors, so that together, we will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this objective in energy conservation,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nexpanding it to clean energy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng cited the example of the hybrid vehicles as an\r\n\r\nillustration that the Government is not prepared to  put  the\r\n\r\nmoney  where  its  mouth  is, in terms  of  promoting  energy\r\n\r\nconservation.  Sir, I beg to differ, because in the  case  of\r\n\r\nthe  hybrid  vehicles,  the Ministry  of  Communications  and\r\n\r\nInformation Technology has already explained that  the  green\r\n\r\npolicy as well as the transportation policy, must go hand  in\r\n\r\nhand.   In  our national interest, Government has to  balance\r\n\r\nbetween the green policy and transportation policy.   As  far\r\n\r\nas  the IACEC is concerned, I assure Mr Heng that my Ministry\r\n\r\nwill   do  whatever  we  can  to  harness  the  support   and\r\n\r\nparticipation of the 3P sectors so that together, we can move\r\n\r\ntowards energy conservation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> I thank the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nhis reply and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Heng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code MF 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore, being a highly urbanised place, the\r\n\r\nnoise level and noise pollution are relatively high, compared\r\n\r\nto  many other countries less urbanised.  Like it or not,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  bear  with  it  if we want to  continue  living  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   On  the  other  hand, I  must  congratulate  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Ministry for doing a marvellous job  in  keeping\r\n\r\nthe  noise pollution within very acceptable limits.  However,\r\n\r\nwhat  I  fail  to  understand is why does the Ministry  still\r\n\r\nallow  the  use  of the normal percussion piling  methods  in\r\n\r\nconstruction sites when these sites are situated  very  close\r\n\r\nto  existing  residential areas.  The use of  such  a  piling\r\n\r\nmethod, using a heavy block dropping on the top of a pile  to\r\n\r\nhammer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  pile into the ground, creates too much noise for  nearby\r\n\r\nresidents,  regardless of the measurement  of  noise  at  the\r\n\r\npoint where the noise is being generated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such a method is similar to using a hammer to knock\r\n\r\na  nail  into a piece of wood, except that the dimensions  of\r\n\r\nthe hammer and nail are now increased by 1,000-fold.  Besides\r\n\r\nnoise,  such a method also often causes stress to  structures\r\n\r\nof  nearby buildings, creating cracks in the walls of  nearby\r\n\r\nbuildings,  and very often, conflicts between neighbours.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like the Minister to consider banning the use of  such\r\n\r\npiling methods in construction sites by reducing the level of\r\n\r\npermitted  noise generated from construction sites when  such\r\n\r\nsites  are  within certain distances from residential  areas.\r\n\r\nAfter  all,  there  are quieter, alternative  piling  methods\r\n\r\nwhich contractors can use.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lily Neo, you have the privilege of\r\n\r\nmoving the last cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, bad air in the\r\n\r\noffice buildings here makes one in three office workers  feel\r\n\r\nlethargic  and  experience dryness of the  throat,  skin  and\r\n\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new survey by the National University of Singapore\r\n\r\n(NUS) researchers found that workers here have it worse  than\r\n\r\nthose in 11 European countries when it comes to 10 out of the\r\n\r\ntop dozen health problems linked to \"sick-building syndrome\".\r\n\r\nSir,  \"sick-building syndrome\" refers to an excess  of  work-related irritation of the skin and mucous membranes and other\r\n\r\nsymptoms,   including  headache  and  fatigue,  reported   by\r\n\r\noccupants in modern office buildings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers checked 98 locations in five buildings.\r\n\r\nThe  buildings  generally had lower levels of carbon  dioxide\r\n\r\nand fine dust particles but marginally higher carbon monoxide\r\n\r\nlevels  than  buildings  in  Europe.   But  high  levels   of\r\n\r\ncontamination were found here in a few isolated locations  in\r\n\r\nthe  five buildings surveyed.  Yeast, mould formaldehyde  and\r\n\r\ncarbon dioxide also exceeded the limits in some spots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one interesting finding of the local survey was\r\n\r\nthat workers were not as dissatisfied with the air quality as\r\n\r\nthose\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Europe, although Singapore workers showed more  symptoms.\r\n\r\nOur  cultural differences could explain this.  It is possible\r\n\r\nthat  employees  here are less likely to  complain  to  their\r\n\r\nbosses,  even  if they suffer \"sick-building syndrome\",  than\r\n\r\nworkers  in European work places.  Earlier, studies  here  by\r\n\r\nENV  found  that one in five office workers here have  health\r\n\r\nproblems because of poorly ventilated buildings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a known fact that indoor air quality is a subject\r\n\r\nof  public  health importance as many spend  a  lot  of  time\r\n\r\nworking  indoors.  Studies show that most people  here  spend\r\n\r\n80%  of  their  time  indoors.  Poor  air  quality  decreases\r\n\r\nproductivity because of discomfort, absenteeism and sickness.\r\n\r\nA  number  of Australian and overseas studies have identified\r\n\r\nthe  high costs of poor quality indoor air.  Sir, these costs\r\n\r\nincluded  direct  medical  costs, loss  in  productivity  and\r\n\r\ndamages  to material and equipment.  Loss in productivity  in\r\n\r\nthe  United States of America is estimated to be nearly  five\r\n\r\ntimes that of direct medical costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air quality is influenced by temperature, humidity, air\r\n\r\nmovement  and  air contaminants.  There are  legislation  and\r\n\r\nregulations governing indoor air quality in US, Australia and\r\n\r\nNew Zealand.  In view of the great implications of indoor air\r\n\r\nquality,  I  would urge the Minister for the  Environment  to\r\n\r\nhave regulations in place here to ensure compliance with  air\r\n\r\nquality  and  thus  ensuring healthier  workers,  and  better\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the US Environmental Protection Agency's draft\r\n\r\nreport  concluded for the first time that dioxin was a  human\r\n\r\ncarcinogen.  May I ask the Minister for the Environment  what\r\n\r\nare  the measures taken by his Ministry to control the  level\r\n\r\nof  dioxins  emitted  into the atmosphere,  and  whether  the\r\n\r\ncurrent levels emitted to our air atmosphere are safe.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Mr\r\n\r\nHeng  Chiang Meng for bringing up this important issue.   Our\r\n\r\nlaw  takes  into consideration the background  noise  of  the\r\n\r\nenvironment.  The noise measured would be adjusted  according\r\n\r\nto the background noise. Therefore, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermissible noise level in a quiet neighbourhood will be more\r\n\r\nstringent,  when  compared  to a  neighbourhood  with  higher\r\n\r\nbackground noise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that jack hammers or percussion hammers can pose\r\n\r\na problem if done close to a residential building, especially\r\n\r\ncaused  by the vibrations which transmit through the  ground.\r\n\r\nOur  law  restricts the noise level being  generated  by  the\r\n\r\npiling  activities, regardless of the types of  equipment  or\r\n\r\nmachinery used during construction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I am pleased to announce that all new\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites, commencing work from 1st  October  2001,\r\n\r\nand  located within 150 metres of residential premises,  will\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  observe a stricter set of noise  levels  at\r\n\r\nnight.    The  decision  to  impose  stricter  noise  control\r\n\r\nmeasures  at  night  was  taken  in  response  to  the   many\r\n\r\ncomplaints  which my Ministry has received.  Last  year,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  we received an average of 33 complaints a  week  on\r\n\r\nconstruction noise, compared to an average of 21 per week  in\r\n\r\n1999.  This is despite the drop in construction activities of\r\n\r\nabout 20% last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new set of noise levels will limit work at\r\n\r\nnight in two segments, the first segment, between 7 pm and 10\r\n\r\npm,  and  the  second segment, between  10  pm  to  the  next\r\n\r\nmorning, at 7 am.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first night segment, from 7 pm to 10 pm, the\r\n\r\npermissible  noise  level will remain  at  65  decibels,  but\r\n\r\naveraged over one hour, and the instantaneous noise over five\r\n\r\nminutes shall not exceed 70 decibels.  From 10 pm till  7  am\r\n\r\nthe next morning, the permissible noise level will be lowered\r\n\r\nto  55 decibels averaged over one hour, and the instantaneous\r\n\r\nnoise over five minutes shall not exceed 60 decibels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given these permissible noise levels, noisy work,\r\n\r\nsuch  as concreting, will not be done after 7 pm.  Less noisy\r\n\r\nwork,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as  erection and dismantling of form  work,  fixing  of\r\n\r\nsteel bars, loading and unloading of materials may be carried\r\n\r\nout.   However,  after  10  pm,  only  quiet  work,  such  as\r\n\r\nbricklaying, plastering and painting can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the more stringent control of our noise at\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites, we hope that residents living  close  to\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites  will  have  quieter  evenings  and  more\r\n\r\nrestful nights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo brought up the point regarding indoor\r\n\r\nair  quality.  Following the 1995 survey, guidelines on  good\r\n\r\nindoor  air  quality  practices were published  in  1996  and\r\n\r\nwidely  distributed  to  those  in  the  building  management\r\n\r\nindustry.   Further studies conducted in  1997  and  1998  in\r\n\r\noffices,  MRT  stations,  schools and  underground  carparks,\r\n\r\nshowed   that   generally,  indoor  air  quality   has   been\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  in  these places, except  for  a  few  isolated\r\n\r\nlocations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laws on indoor air quality may not be necessary at this\r\n\r\ntime,  as  standards  have  also not  been  set  by  WHO  and\r\n\r\nthreshold levels not established.  In the meantime,  however,\r\n\r\nENV  enacted  laws  in February this year to  require  proper\r\n\r\nmaintenance   of  water  cooling  system  in   central   air-conditioning  of  all  public  buildings.   This  law,   when\r\n\r\nenforced,  will  bring  down incidence of  the  Legionnaires'\r\n\r\ndisease,  caused by the legionnaire bacteria which  grows  in\r\n\r\npoorly maintained water cooling tanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question about dioxin, as Dr Lily Neo knows,\r\n\r\ndioxins  are  by-products  of  combustion.   They  are   also\r\n\r\nproduced by some industrial and natural processes.   ENV  has\r\n\r\nbeen monitoring dioxin levels in ambient air since 1999.   So\r\n\r\nfar,  trace  levels  have  been detected  occasionally.

PUB was then restructured\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   regulate  the  electricity  and  gas  industries,  while\r\n\r\nretaining its responsibilities for ensuring safe and reliable\r\n\r\nwater supply in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, PUB comprises two parts: the electricity and\r\n\r\ngas  Regulator and the Water Department.  But the  PUB  Water\r\n\r\nDepartment  is not the only agency dealing with  water.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Environment (ENV) also deals  with  water,\r\n\r\nthrough its Drainage and Sewerage Departments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Public Utilities Bill is to respond to the changes\r\n\r\nin  the  water industry. Allow me to explain.  In  the  early\r\n\r\ndays,  drainage  systems were meant to drain  away  rainwater\r\n\r\nquickly  to  prevent  flooding.  At the same  time,  sewerage\r\n\r\nsystems  were put in place to control pollution in  order  to\r\n\r\nprotect  public  health.   Hence the  Drainage  and  Sewerage\r\n\r\nDepartments come under ENV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, pollution is well under control in Singapore and\r\n\r\nall our water catchments have been cleaned up. All used water\r\n\r\nis  now  channelled into our sewerage systems and  all  solid\r\n\r\nwastes are collected and treated before disposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With clean catchments, our drainage system is no longer\r\n\r\njust  for flood prevention but has, in selected areas, become\r\n\r\nmeans to channel rainwater into our reservoirs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, water treatment technology has advanced\r\n\r\nconsiderably, making it economical to treat and recycle  used\r\n\r\nwater  in  a  significant  way.  The  used  water  from   our\r\n\r\nwastewater treatment plants can today be treated to standards\r\n\r\nmuch  higher  than the WHO's drinking water  standards,  even\r\n\r\nmeeting   the  stringent  requirements  of  those  industries\r\n\r\nrequiring ultra-pure water, as in the wafer fabs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has enabled us to construct a robust water supply\r\n\r\nsystem  by  tapping on several economically  viable  sources,\r\n\r\nthereby  diversifying our water sources.  Thus,  even  as  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to develop more of our local sources of  water  and\r\n\r\nbuy  water from Malaysia, we are also exploring buying  water\r\n\r\nfrom Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  with  the opportunity now available through advances  in\r\n\r\ntechnology, we will also develop seawater desalination plants\r\n\r\nand recycle used water more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that we can fully exploit our domestic water\r\n\r\nresources, we cannot continue to manage the water cycle under\r\n\r\nseparate   agencies.  To  reduce  wastage  and   to   exploit\r\n\r\nsynergies,  we  need  a  PUB that has  the  mandate  and  the\r\n\r\nresources  to  manage  the entire water cycle  optimally;  in\r\n\r\nother  words,  we  should  integrate  the  separate  agencies\r\n\r\ntogether into a sole water authority for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to merge the\r\n\r\nexisting PUB Water Department and ENV's Drainage and Sewerage\r\n\r\nDepartments  into  a restructured PUB.  The restructured  PUB\r\n\r\nwill  then  be  placed  under ENV.  At  the  same  time,  the\r\n\r\nelectricity and gas regulatory functions of the existing  PUB\r\n\r\nwill  be taken out to form a new statutory board, the  Energy\r\n\r\nMarket  Authority of Singapore or EMA under the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to effect these changes, this Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  I move today seeks to repeal the Public Utilities  Act\r\n\r\n(Cap. 261) to be re-enacted as the Public Utilities Act 2001.\r\n\r\nThe  re-enacted  Act  will enable the Sewerage  and  Drainage\r\n\r\nDepartments   of  ENV  to  be  integrated  with   the   Water\r\n\r\nDepartment, forming the restructured PUB.  The responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  the restructured PUB will then be moved from MTI to  ENV\r\n\r\nwith effect from 1st April 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Water Authority</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructured PUB will become the sole water\r\n\r\nauthority    in   Singapore.    The   Bill   retains,    with\r\n\r\nmodifications,   the  provisions  of  the   existing   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Act with regard to the functions, duties and powers\r\n\r\nof  the PUB in relation to water.  The Bill will also empower\r\n\r\nthe  restructured PUB to directly administer the Sewerage and\r\n\r\nDrainage Acts, which were hitherto administered by ENV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions and duties of the restructured PUB will\r\n\r\ninclude providing an adequate supply of water, regulating the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupply  of  piped  water  for  human  consumption,  supplying\r\n\r\nindustrial  and treated used water, and operating the  public\r\n\r\nsewer systems and storm water drainage systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Main Provisions in the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now touch briefly on the main\r\n\r\nprovisions in this Bill. Clauses 6 and 7, together  with  the\r\n\r\nSecond Schedule of the Bill, set out the functions and duties\r\n\r\nof the restructured PUB.  Briefly, it will provide, construct\r\n\r\nand  maintain  the infrastructure for the collection,  supply\r\n\r\nand  use of water for public and private purposes; secure and\r\n\r\nprovide  an  adequate  supply  of  water  for  Singapore   at\r\n\r\nreasonable prices; and regulate the supply of piped water for\r\n\r\nhuman consumption.  It will act as an agent of the Government\r\n\r\nin the management and maintenance of public sewerage systems,\r\n\r\npublic  sewers and storm water drainage systems,  drains  and\r\n\r\ndrainage reserves belonging to the Government.  It will  also\r\n\r\nregulate  the  construction, maintenance and  improvement  of\r\n\r\nsewerage  and  land drainage systems, and  the  discharge  of\r\n\r\nsewage and trade effluent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing powers of the current PUB to regulate and\r\n\r\nimplement  the  supply  of water for  human  consumption  are\r\n\r\nretained in Parts IV and V of  this Bill.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, more stringent measures over water service\r\n\r\ninstallations are being introduced in view of the  experience\r\n\r\ngained from the recent water contamination incident in  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah Plaza. Currently PUB requires water installations to be\r\n\r\nchecked  once  every year by licensed plumbers. This  measure\r\n\r\nwill remain in force.  The Bill will in addition require such\r\n\r\ninstallations to be inspected by a professional engineer  and\r\n\r\ncertified  fit  and safe once every five  years.   Any  party\r\n\r\nconvicted of contravening this requirement will be liable  to\r\n\r\na  fine  not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a  term\r\n\r\nnot exceeding 12 months, or to both.  The Bill will also hold\r\n\r\nparties  responsible  for  causing  contamination  to   water\r\n\r\nsupplied  by  PUB. Responsible parties will  have  to  ensure\r\n\r\nregular and adequate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchecks   on  their  water  installations.  The  penalty   for\r\n\r\ncontravening  this requirement is $50,000 or to  imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor a term not exceeding three years, or to both.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transfer  of  Assets and Protecting Terms and  Conditions  of Service for Staff</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In restructuring the PUB, we will need to ensure the\r\n\r\nproper  transfer of staff, properties, rights and liabilities\r\n\r\nrelated  to the Sewerage and Drainage Departments of ENV,  to\r\n\r\nthe  PUB.  Clauses 60 to 66 provide for the transfer  to  the\r\n\r\nPUB  of property, assets and liabilities and of employees  in\r\n\r\nthe  Sewerage and Drainage Departments and the protection  of\r\n\r\ntheir terms and conditions of service on transfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, water is a strategic resource.\r\n\r\nTechnology advances, both in seawater desalination and in the\r\n\r\ntreatment  and  recycling of used water, have enabled  us  to\r\n\r\nconsiderably  enhance our water strategy.  These developments\r\n\r\nopen up more choices and allow us to diversify our sources of\r\n\r\nwater.   The restructured PUB will be able to take  advantage\r\n\r\nof  these  developments and deliver to us a more  robust  and\r\n\r\nsecure water supply in a holistic and optimal way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, in speaking on\r\n\r\nthis Bill, let me first declare my interest that I am a Board\r\n\r\nmember  of  the present Public Utilities Board.  I note  that\r\n\r\nthe   new   Public  Utilities  Bill  will  bring  the   water\r\n\r\nundertaking  portion of the present PUB,  together  with  the\r\n\r\nSewerage  and  Drainage Departments of the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  (ENV),  to  form the  sole  water  authority  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   At  the  same time, the current  power  and  gas\r\n\r\nregulatory  functions  of  PUB will  be  retained  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Trade and Industry, under a new statutory  board.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew restructured PUB will come under the ambit of ENV.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after listening to the various clarifications on\r\n\r\nwater   related  issues  by  the  Acting  Minister  for   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  who  spoke  during  the  Committee   of   Supply\r\n\r\ndeliberations yesterday and also studying the  chart  on  the\r\n\r\nfuture thrust of the Environment Ministry, distributed during\r\n\r\nthe  session, and also as asserted by the Acting Minister for\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry just now, I am convinced that bringing the\r\n\r\nwater  management function of the current PUB into  one  sole\r\n\r\nauthority  will  provide the needed focus on all  aspects  of\r\n\r\nwater  regulation and management.  Its integration  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Environment's Drainage  Department  (which\r\n\r\nconstructs   and   maintains  drainage  systems   for   water\r\n\r\ncollection and its channelling into reservoirs or  seas)  and\r\n\r\nthe  Sewerage  Department (which collects  and  treats  waste\r\n\r\nwater to acceptable standards before re-use) closes the water\r\n\r\nloop  which will bring about optimal deployment of  resources\r\n\r\nto enable us to maximise the use from our water inventory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among several water topics, the Acting Minister\r\n\r\nyesterday also spoke at length about how Newater is produced,\r\n\r\nemploying the latest in membrane technology, Newater's future\r\n\r\nusage  plan  and  how it will benefit the  wafer  fabrication\r\n\r\nindustry  in terms of purer water and lower cost.  With  only\r\n\r\n5%  of  the water now being recycled and 95% discharged  into\r\n\r\nthe  sea,  we have enormous potential to do more  to  exploit\r\n\r\never improving technologies to reclaim and recycle used water\r\n\r\nfrom  a  multitude of sources.  This very fact alone provides\r\n\r\nfor  strong justification to bring together the entire  water\r\n\r\nmanagement  chain  from water collection  and  processing  to\r\n\r\nreclamation  and recycling to achieve not only  economies  of\r\n\r\nscale but also efficiency maximisation in water distribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, as we move forward with new initiatives to\r\n\r\nharness  our water inventory, it is important that  assurance\r\n\r\nbe given to the public that the water supply delivered to our\r\n\r\nhomes remains of high quality as we have them today.  Any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajor change in the elemental composition should properly  be\r\n\r\ncommunicated to prevent unnecessary alarm.  Public trust must\r\n\r\nalways be maintained in whatever we do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singaporeans, we all know how precious water is\r\n\r\nto  all  of us.  It is imperative that we continue to concern\r\n\r\nourselves with finding new and innovative methods in  how  we\r\n\r\ncan  collect  and re-use as much of the water as possible  in\r\n\r\nour  country.  Doing this will decrease our dependence on our\r\n\r\nneighbours who often enough have threatened to cut our  water\r\n\r\nsupply  or have used it as a bargaining chip when negotiating\r\n\r\nissues  of  strategic  importance.  As we  discover  new  and\r\n\r\ncheaper  techniques to do this, there must be  no  let-up  in\r\n\r\ncontinuous  public  education of the preciousness  of  water.\r\n\r\nThe  current  PUB has done a terrific job in  bringing  about\r\n\r\nthis consciousness to the public.  And it is my hope that the\r\n\r\nnew PUB will continue the good work of its predecessors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I applaud the retention of the acronym \"PUB\",\r\n\r\nwhich is indeed a familiar household name, the PUB as we know\r\n\r\nit today deals with all aspects of public utilities, not only\r\n\r\nwater  but  also electricity and gas supplies to  our  homes.\r\n\r\nCould  the Minister please explain why this name is retained,\r\n\r\neven  though  the new PUB will be concerned with water  only?\r\n\r\nAlso,  what will happen to the PUB bills?  Will we in  future\r\n\r\nhave  separate bills for water, electricity and gas?  If  so,\r\n\r\nwill  this not make it more cumbersome for the public to deal\r\n\r\nwith so many bills?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I have, Sir, is with regard to the\r\n\r\nwater facilities in Johor, Malaysia, which is managed by  the\r\n\r\npresent  PUB.  I would like to ask the Minister  whether  the\r\n\r\nnewly  constituted  PUB  will embrace  the  entire  Malaysian\r\n\r\noperation as it is, and whether it will directly inherit  all\r\n\r\nthe people involved in the Malaysian operation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Ahmad Magad for\r\n\r\nsupporting the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At yesterday's Committee of Supply debate on the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Environment, the Acting Minister  for  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  had spoken at length about water, its  security,\r\n\r\nand so on.  So I would not touch on that now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me address the reason why the name \"PUB\" is\r\n\r\nretained.   As  Mr Magad has said, this is a  household  name\r\n\r\ntoday.   It  has got international repute and accolades  from\r\n\r\nmany  countries  as  well.  In fact, we have  considered  the\r\n\r\nalternative  of, perhaps, calling it the \"Water Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore\".   But  it would seem a great pity  to  consign  a\r\n\r\nhousehold name, a very well-known and familiar name,  to  the\r\n\r\narchives.  In any case, water is a public utility and  it  is\r\n\r\nby no means a misnomer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also say that proper management of water,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  rainfall, used water or drinking  water,  is\r\n\r\nvery, very much a matter for the protection of public health.\r\n\r\nThis  is  one  of the reasons why we would have also  put  it\r\n\r\nunder  the Ministry of the Environment.  But although we  say\r\n\r\nthat water is an important resource not only for domestic use\r\n\r\nand  it  affects  public health, the Ministry  of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  (MTI)  would still continue to have  a  very,  very\r\n\r\nstrong  interest in that because water is also  a  factor  of\r\n\r\nproduction in the economy.  We would be keeping a very  close\r\n\r\nwatch, as the whole of Singapore would.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was also asked on whether the restructuring\r\n\r\nof  PUB will affect the employees working in Johor now.   The\r\n\r\nanswer  is  that the Water Department of PUB  would  be  kept\r\n\r\nintact and all the employees would not be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Clarification, Sir.

I will explain the restructuring of  these  two\r\n\r\nindustries  in greater detail during the Second  Readings  of\r\n\r\nthe Electricity and Gas Bills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to establish the EMA as the\r\n\r\nRegulator of the electricity and gas industries, as  well  as\r\n\r\nother energy sectors that it is designated to regulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Role of the Regulator, EMA</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the restructuring is completed in the second\r\n\r\nhalf of this year, our electricity and gas industries will be\r\n\r\nquite  different  from the status quo.  We  can  expect  more\r\n\r\nlocal  and  foreign  industry players to participate  in  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive generation and retail sectors.  It will become  a\r\n\r\nmore  dynamic  and  vibrant market with generation  companies\r\n\r\ncompeting to sell electricity into the wholesale market,  and\r\n\r\nretailers bidding to purchase electricity from the generators\r\n\r\nand supplying it to the consumers.  Consumers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan expect greater choice of electricity suppliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new competitive environment, the regulator has a\r\n\r\ncritical  role in ensuring the smooth and efficient operation\r\n\r\nof  the  markets.   Like the referee of a soccer  match,  the\r\n\r\nregulator  has to ensure that the players compete fairly  and\r\n\r\nabide  by  the  rules and regulations.  He has  to  blow  the\r\n\r\nwhistle  and show the yellow card on players who  breach  the\r\n\r\nrules; on certain occasions, he may even have to show the red\r\n\r\ncard.  A good soccer match is the result of the confluence of\r\n\r\nthree important factors: a clear set of rules of the game,  a\r\n\r\nteam  of strong players and a fair and alert referee.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  unknown  for  a poor soccer match to be  blamed  on  bad\r\n\r\nrefereeing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our electricity and gas sectors are being restructured\r\n\r\ninto  a more competitive one.  The role of the regulator  has\r\n\r\ntherefore to evolve from one of regulating monopolies to that\r\n\r\nof  regulating competitive markets.  In the new  regime,  EMA\r\n\r\nwill  focus  on  ensuring that there is a good framework  for\r\n\r\nvibrant  competitive  markets  whilst  still  regulating  the\r\n\r\nmonopoly  functions  of  transmission  and  distribution   of\r\n\r\nelectricity and gas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing back the soccer game analogy, EMA has to be a\r\n\r\ngood  referee as well as a good rule maker.  As referee,  EMA\r\n\r\nis  in  the soccer field with the players, running with them,\r\n\r\nwatching their play constantly and closely.  The referee  has\r\n\r\nto  make  fair  and timely decisions in the soccer  field  to\r\n\r\nallow  the  game to continue uninterrupted.  But  EMA's  role\r\n\r\ngoes beyond just being a good referee.  The EMA has to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the rules remain relevant and fair.  As the rule maker,\r\n\r\nthe  EMA has to be independent, open and transparent  in  its\r\n\r\ndecision-making.   Its rules must be clear  and  unambiguous.\r\n\r\nIts  approach  would  be  one  of  active  consultation  with\r\n\r\nconsumers and industry.  It justifies its policies  not  just\r\n\r\non   sound  legal  grounds  but  also  on  rigorous  economic\r\n\r\nanalysis.  The job of the Regulator will become more complex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMA has four key roles. First, it must promote a\r\n\r\ncompetitive and well-functioning electricity and gas market,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestricting  market power, while at the same  time,  ensuring\r\n\r\nthe  security  and  reliability of the  electricity  and  gas\r\n\r\nsupply.   It  will  need to carry out the  balanced  role  of\r\n\r\nensuring that market forces work in a competitive environment\r\n\r\nand  yet  maintaining an element of control for security  and\r\n\r\nreliability  of  supply.  It has to foster  a  stable  market\r\n\r\nenvironment  that will promote competition, encourage  timely\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  generation  and  transmission  capacity,  and\r\n\r\ninstil investor confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the security and reliability of power supply,\r\n\r\nthe  EMA  will  take over responsibility for controlling  and\r\n\r\noperating  the  electricity  system  network  from  Singapore\r\n\r\nPower.  This will ensure that the security of our electricity\r\n\r\nsystem  which  can potentially influence competition  in  the\r\n\r\nelectricity   market,   is   not   affected   by   commercial\r\n\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, EMA will safeguard the interests of consumers,\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that they are provided with electricity  and  gas\r\n\r\nservices  at  competitive prices and of  adequate  standards.\r\n\r\nThrough a comprehensive licensing framework and a set of well-established market rules and codes of practices, the EMA will\r\n\r\nbe  empowered to act against errant companies if  performance\r\n\r\nand  service  fall below specified levels.  It can  also  use\r\n\r\nincentives  to  motivate market players to higher  levels  of\r\n\r\nperformance and service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important area for the EMA is the close monitoring of\r\n\r\nmarket behaviour to guard against the concentration of market\r\n\r\npower,  abuse  of  dominance and exercise of anti-competitive\r\n\r\nbehaviours,  such  as  collusion and capacity  withdrawal  to\r\n\r\ndrive   up   prices.   We  have  therefore  included   strong\r\n\r\ncompetition provisions into the Electricity and Gas Bills  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  EMA to act against anti-competitive  behaviours\r\n\r\nand  practices.  I will elaborate on these provisions in  the\r\n\r\nSecond Reading of the Electricity Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the EMA will promote the efficient use of energy\r\n\r\nutilities.   As  Singapore  has  to  import  all  our  energy\r\n\r\nrequirements, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  encourage and educate the public to use energy sensibly\r\n\r\nand  conserve as much as possible.  The EMA will work closely\r\n\r\nwith  industry, consumers and other regulatory agencies, like\r\n\r\nthe  Building  Control  Authority  (BCA),  to  encourage  the\r\n\r\nadoption  of  conservation measures like  energy  audits  and\r\n\r\nenergy-efficient equipment and devices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the EMA will represent Singapore's interest in\r\n\r\nregional  and international energy forums, such as ASEAN  and\r\n\r\nAPEC.   This is to ensure that we will continue to have  free\r\n\r\nand  non-discriminatory access to global sources  of  energy,\r\n\r\nespecially  oil and natural gas.  Members would be  aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  two  important projects being pursued  under  ASEAN  co-operation,  that is, the ASEAN Power Grid and the Trans-ASEAN\r\n\r\nGas  Pipeline.  These projects when completed  will  give  us\r\n\r\naccess to more competitive energy sources and further enhance\r\n\r\nthe security of our energy supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of EMA in carrying out these roles will be\r\n\r\nmeasured  by how well the market is performing in  delivering\r\n\r\nreliable   electricity  and  gas  supply  to   consumers   at\r\n\r\ncompetitive prices with the best level of service.  Consumers\r\n\r\nwill  have a host of suppliers providing electricity and  gas\r\n\r\nservices  tailored according to their needs.  There  will  be\r\n\r\ntimely   and  adequate  investment  in  new  generation   and\r\n\r\ntransmission  capacity  to  meet the  needs  of  the  growing\r\n\r\neconomy and electricity demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to perform its role effectively, the EMA has to\r\n\r\nbe  given  adequate  resources.   The  EMA  will  absorb  the\r\n\r\nexisting  staff of the Regulation Department of  the  current\r\n\r\nPUB  and  the System Control Unit of PowerGrid,  which  is  a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  of Singapore Power.  In addition,  the  EMA  will\r\n\r\nprogressively  build up a pool of economists  with  expertise\r\n\r\nand knowledge in economic regulation, micro-economic analysis\r\n\r\nand competition policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Features of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill serves as an umbrella Act\r\n\r\nthat empowers EMA to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadminister  the  industry-specific legislation,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nElectricity  Act  2001,  the Gas Act 2001  and  the  District\r\n\r\nCooling  Act  2001.  These legislation spell out the  details\r\n\r\nfor  the  regulation of the respective industry.  I  will  be\r\n\r\nmoving them for the Second Reading following the EMA Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill sets out the functions and duties\r\n\r\nof the EMA which I have enunciated earlier.  Clauses 21 to 23\r\n\r\nprovide   for   the  transfer  of  properties,   assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities of the Regulation Department of the  PUB  to  the\r\n\r\nEMA.  It also provides for the transfer of employees from the\r\n\r\nPUB  to  the  EMA  and  the protection  of  their  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of service on transfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, energy is an important factor of production in any\r\n\r\neconomy.   It  is also an essential utility service.   Within\r\n\r\nthe   broader   framework  of  keeping  our  business   costs\r\n\r\ncompetitive,   we   have   to   keep   our   energy    market\r\n\r\ninternationally competitive.  With this Bill, the EMA will be\r\n\r\nable  to effectively oversee the development of a competitive\r\n\r\nmarket  for  our  energy utilities, ensure the  reliable  and\r\n\r\nsecure  supply  of  electricity and  gas  and  safeguard  the\r\n\r\ninterests of consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  support  this Bill as this new Energy Market Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore Bill sets to liberalise the entire electricity  and\r\n\r\ngas  sectors.  When the Bill becomes law, it will enable  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   gradually  break  up  the  generation   and\r\n\r\nproduction from the sale and distribution so that there  will\r\n\r\nbe  more  competition, leading to more efficiency  and  lower\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Energy Market Authority (called EMA in short)\r\n\r\nwill  regulate  the gas, electricity and other energy-related\r\n\r\nmatters.  Overall, I feel that the concept and intentions are\r\n\r\nlaudable  and  will  lead to benefits to the  end  consumers,\r\n\r\nwhich are the industries, businesses and homes.  It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  the  liberalisation of the commercial  sectors,  as  in\r\n\r\nbanking  and  finance.  In banking, this is called  the  \"Big\r\n\r\nBang\".   Although  the  concept is the same,  in  the  energy\r\n\r\nsector,  if  we are liberalising this sector, we  better  not\r\n\r\ncall  it  the \"Big Bang\".  Because in a sensitive area,  like\r\n\r\nenergy,  we  have to be very careful.  If wrongly ignited,  a\r\n\r\n\"Big Bang\" of the energy sector may lead to a big explosion!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indeed concerned that if this is not done\r\n\r\nproperly, the liberalisation exercise will indeed explode  in\r\n\r\nour  face.   I do have a worry that, if not managed properly,\r\n\r\nthe breaking up of the sector could turn into a mess.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Adequate Market Size</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to explain my concerns.\r\n\r\nFirst,  adequate market size.  I have a worry as  to  whether\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  too small a market for the proper  competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment  for  this energy sector to  operate.   Is  there\r\n\r\nsufficient market size to allow several players to enter  the\r\n\r\nmarket  and  remain viable and sustainable?  Is there  enough\r\n\r\nroom   for  several  power  generation  companies,  each   of\r\n\r\nsufficient economy of scale?  Naturally, the large Government-linked  Companies (GLCs) will be entering  the  sector.   But\r\n\r\nwill  there  be  other interested parties, like  the  private\r\n\r\ncompanies and foreign MNCs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is insufficient number of players to become\r\n\r\npower  generation companies (called Gencos in short) will  it\r\n\r\nlead to inefficiencies?  Will it lead to more efficiency,  or\r\n\r\nin  fact  to the contrary, more confusion?  If the number  of\r\n\r\nplayers  is  small,  would there,  in  fact,  be  a  risk  of\r\n\r\ncartelisation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Impact on Prices and Service Standards</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity and gas coming out of the copper wire or\r\n\r\ncopper  pipe  will  be the same, since they  are  all  pumped\r\n\r\nthrough a common grid.  Unlike other consumer products, there\r\n\r\nis really no product differentiation for electricity and gas.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  my  second question is: will  there  be  a  wider\r\n\r\nnumber of options and choices?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat will be the impact on prices and service levels?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues and potential problems mentioned above\r\n\r\nare  also  applicable to the suppliers, who will on-sell  the\r\n\r\nelectricity  or  gas to the end-users.   How  would  the  EMA\r\n\r\nensure that the suppliers give better prices and provide good\r\n\r\nservice standards?  If the number of players is limited,  how\r\n\r\nis  the EMA able to ensure that fair practices are maintained\r\n\r\nby the suppliers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Difficulty of Regulation of Several Participants</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue is that with the sector sub-divided\r\n\r\ninto  several  parts, would there be more difficulty  in  the\r\n\r\nregulation and supervision of the many participants?  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  there was just one body, which was the former PUB,  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  and  manage.  Now, the new EMA  has  to  watch  over\r\n\r\nseveral  players.  As the Senior Minister of State has  said,\r\n\r\ncan the EMA be a good referee?  How would the EMA be able  to\r\n\r\nensure  reliability of supply?  And what if the players  play\r\n\r\nfoul?   Can the EMA act fast enough?  In the event  of  power\r\n\r\nfailures,  what are the fallback or urgent recovery measures?\r\n\r\nHow  would  the EMA ensure technical competency of the  power\r\n\r\ngeneration companies?  Any power failure will not only  cause\r\n\r\ninconvenience, but can also cause hazards to lives  and  high\r\n\r\neconomic  loss  to  industries, in terms  of  production  and\r\n\r\noutput.   We  are reminded of the total power  loss  problems\r\n\r\nencountered in places like Malaysia, California, New  Zealand\r\n\r\nand other places.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public Dissemination and Explanation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fourth area is on public dissemination and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the new structure.  Here, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nurge  MTI  and  the  new referee, EMA, to  conduct  extensive\r\n\r\npublic forums and publicity, to explain the structure of  the\r\n\r\nnew energy sector.  For industries, it is important that they\r\n\r\nunderstand the mechanics of the new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstructure  so  that  they can make the  right  decisions  and\r\n\r\nselect the right choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for small businesses and households, I would like to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the transition be conducted in a more  gradual\r\n\r\nmanner.  For these users, the need for clear and wide  public\r\n\r\nexplanation  is  even more important.  For example,  in  some\r\n\r\nhouseholds, we may have old folks living in very small flats,\r\n\r\nor  residents  who are illiterate, who cannot understand  the\r\n\r\nchoices   given  to  them  and,  therefore,  are  unable   to\r\n\r\nunderstand the whole new structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Learning from Others' Experiences</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth point is whether there will be examples around\r\n\r\nthe  world  where  the  new approach  has  been  successfully\r\n\r\nimplemented.   If the new concept has been tried  and  tested\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  can  we  not  learn from  them  and  avoid  their\r\n\r\nmistakes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Trade and Industry for taking this bold move of revamping\r\n\r\nthe  entire  energy  sector.   I  support  the  Bill  as  the\r\n\r\nobjectives  are  noble,  which are to  generate  competition,\r\n\r\nleading  to better efficiency, better service and, hopefully,\r\n\r\nlower prices for the end consumers.  Sir, let us hope that it\r\n\r\nwill work as planned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill relating to the establishment of the  Energy\r\n\r\nMarket  Authority in conjunction with the regulation  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity  and  gas  industries  upon  liberalisation   and\r\n\r\nderegulation  of  activity.  Sir, I wish, however,  to  raise\r\n\r\nseveral  issues from the perspective of the domestic consumer\r\n\r\nof electricity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the principle of complete pass-through of\r\n\r\ncosts.   Sir,  as  I  have raised earlier during  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate,  the  intended  extension of  liberalisation  to  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  segment  would  mean free  market  forces  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  work.   Currently,  owing  to  the  monopolistic\r\n\r\nsituation  and  the  quarterly review of  tariffs,  household\r\n\r\nconsumers are not really exposed to the volatility  of,  say,\r\n\r\nthe fuel oil price cycle, such as the one seen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecently.   As such, a substantial amount of public education\r\n\r\nshould  be  undertaken  to  acquaint  households  with   this\r\n\r\nprinciple, that there will no longer be price regulation  nor\r\n\r\nany  review.  Notwithstanding this, I would also like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister separately what measures will be taken to  help\r\n\r\npreserve  price  stability  as far  as  possible.   Also,  in\r\n\r\npractice,  how would EMA determine whether prices are  indeed\r\n\r\ncompetitively set?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, infrastructural costs. When the retailing\r\n\r\nfunction is liberalised, presumably, there will be scope  for\r\n\r\nproduct  differentiation,  even  on  just  price  alone,  eg,\r\n\r\noffering  peak and off-peak rates.  As such, there  are  very\r\n\r\nlikely to be some changes to the supply infrastructure, eg, a\r\n\r\nchange in meters.  Unlike big corporate customers, individual\r\n\r\nhouseholds  will  not  wield the same  amount  of  bargaining\r\n\r\npower.   In  the light of this, can the Minister  assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse   that   households  will  not  have  to   bear   these\r\n\r\ninfrastructure-related costs unfairly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, choice available to households. Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister has said that consumers would enjoy greater  choice.\r\n\r\nBut  what choice would households really enjoy?  As mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, unlike big corporate customers, households, on their\r\n\r\nown,   do  not  have  strong  bargaining  power.   Is  there,\r\n\r\ntherefore, a possibility of, say, Town Councils or, for  that\r\n\r\nmatter, the Housing and Development Board itself, functioning\r\n\r\nas  a  retail  supplier to HDB dwellers?  In  this  way,  the\r\n\r\naggregate buying power will be greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, from the domestic consumers'\r\n\r\nperspective, liberalisation or deregulation must bring  forth\r\n\r\nsome  tangible benefits.  These could be either lower tariffs\r\n\r\non  average, or more choice through the bundling of  services\r\n\r\nby suppliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto  speak in support of the Government's privatisation  plans\r\n\r\nto  set  up  a regulatory authority for the energy  utilities\r\n\r\nmarket.   By  injecting competition in the energy market,  we\r\n\r\nare  in  fact allowing market forces to help ensure that  the\r\n\r\nutilisation of resources will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe better maximised.  This is important for Singapore, as our\r\n\r\nresources  are scarce.  In the long run, having more  players\r\n\r\nin   the   energy  market  should  also  benefit   customers.\r\n\r\nConsumers will be given more choices.  The competition should\r\n\r\nlead to better service and new products.  Pricing for the use\r\n\r\nof energy utilities should also become more competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, Sir, the road to privatisation is\r\n\r\nnot  without obstacles.  There are some lessons that  we  can\r\n\r\nlearn  from our past privatisation experiences.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ntransitional period that needs to be managed before  multiple\r\n\r\nplayers establish themselves in the energy market, before the\r\n\r\nmarket  is  fully liberalised, before free market forces  can\r\n\r\noperate to the benefit of consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some issues I would like the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider.   We  all know that energy utility is an  essential\r\n\r\nservice.   By  this,  I mean that it is  a  service  that  is\r\n\r\nrequired  by  everyone.  Residents of all income groups  need\r\n\r\nthe  supply of electricity and gas to their homes.  The level\r\n\r\nof consumption may be different, but energy utility is needed\r\n\r\nby the rich, the poor and the man-in-the-street.  Sir, if the\r\n\r\nprices  of  energy utilities are not properly  regulated,  it\r\n\r\nwill  contribute to inflationary pressures and raise business\r\n\r\ncosts.   If  services by energy companies are not up  to  the\r\n\r\nmark,  if  their  infrastructural and capital  investment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   inadequate,  it  can  lead  to   unnecessary\r\n\r\nblackouts, inconvenience to households, and major disruptions\r\n\r\nto the economy.  We may not plunge into a post-liberalisation\r\n\r\nscenario  similar to the recent experiences of  Californians.\r\n\r\nBut we have had minor disruptions that warrant some concerns.\r\n\r\nFor example, we know from experience that an upsurge of power\r\n\r\ndisrupt  automated banking service, wafer fab production  and\r\n\r\nso  on.   What  we  must  prevent at  all  cost  is  a  post-liberalisation  scenario where frequent  glitches  by  energy\r\n\r\ncompanies  lead  to  a  crippling of  investors'  confidence.\r\n\r\nGlitches in energy supply should be exceptional.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they do happen, people will start to ask why\r\n\r\ndid the Government want\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  opt  for privatisation?  For example, ask any man-in-the-street  or those from the lower income group for their  views\r\n\r\non their experiences following the sale of POSBank, they will\r\n\r\nlament  to  us  that it was more convenient in the  past,  as\r\n\r\nthere  used to be more POSBank branches.  They will  complain\r\n\r\nto  us  about the long queues and waiting time that they  are\r\n\r\nnow  subject  to.   They  will  remember  the  administrative\r\n\r\ncharges that were waived by the people's bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, some people are wary that privatised\r\n\r\nentities  would  be too focused on getting  the  best  bottom\r\n\r\nline,  to the extent that the basic and fundamental interests\r\n\r\nof the common people are sacrificed in the process.  They are\r\n\r\nconcerned  that  privatised entities  might  be  too  profit-driven,  becoming  more interested in striking  up  strategic\r\n\r\nalliances  to be a key regional energy utilities  player  and\r\n\r\nforget  about the average Singaporean, especially those  from\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income  group.   The lower  income  families  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  that they may no longer be able to enjoy subsidies\r\n\r\nfor energy utilities in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the regulatory body has been given a huge\r\n\r\nresponsibility.   They must be proactive about  ensuring  the\r\n\r\nbest  service  quality and competitive pricing,  rather  than\r\n\r\ntake  a passive approach of slapping the penalties after  the\r\n\r\nproblem  has  occurred.   This is a  role  that  I  hope  our\r\n\r\nregulatory  authorities will adopt.  We must learn  from  the\r\n\r\nrecent  experience of the Californians.  We must ensure  that\r\n\r\nenergy utility companies coming into the local market must be\r\n\r\nwilling    to    commit   themselves   to   make   sufficient\r\n\r\ninfrastructural investments.  I hope that the  Energy  Market\r\n\r\nAuthority  of Singapore does not assume that, by having  more\r\n\r\nplayers  in  the  market, it will result in competition  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  naturally  benefit the consumers.   That  is  not\r\n\r\nalways the case.  After all, it was only quite recently  that\r\n\r\nour  motorists were quite unhappy that when oil  prices  were\r\n\r\nfalling,  the  petroleum companies in Singapore maintained  a\r\n\r\ncartel-like grip on the local petroleum\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket,  and were reluctant to lower petrol prices  until  an\r\n\r\nissue  was  made  out  of it.  Should we still  allow  market\r\n\r\nforces to prevail, even if there is collusion between the key\r\n\r\nservice providers or suppliers in the market?  Is the  Energy\r\n\r\nMarket  Authority  of Singapore empowered  to  intervene  and\r\n\r\nregulate prices?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, consumers may exercise their discretion\r\n\r\nand rights by switching to another service provider.  But, in\r\n\r\nthe  initial transitional stage of privatisation, before more\r\n\r\nplayers come in and establish themselves in the market,  what\r\n\r\nchoice  do consumers have?  How can the consumers' rights  be\r\n\r\nprotected from a privatised monopoly, duopoly or oligopoly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Energy Market Authority of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  adopt a pro-active watchdog role  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  interests of consumers, especially those from  the\r\n\r\nlower  income  group, continue to be protected  in  terms  of\r\n\r\npricing and service quality.  The last thing that we want  to\r\n\r\nsee  out  of  this  privatisation exercise is  another  post-POSBank debacle emerging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I am glad that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has finally decided to fully liberalise the energy\r\n\r\nmarket  in  Singapore.  Like the telecommunications industry,\r\n\r\nthe  energy  business  is really a worldwide  commodity  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  there is little need for the Government  to  have\r\n\r\nsuch a strong control and monopoly over the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is the basis for the rest of the Bills that we\r\n\r\nwill  be  debating today and, as I studied the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nBills,  I  realised  that the Government  is  making  drastic\r\n\r\nchanges  to  make  almost  everything  contestable,  and   to\r\n\r\nprivatise  the  whole  value  chain  of  activities  in   the\r\n\r\nelectricity and gas industries.  The one concern  I  have  is\r\n\r\nthat  the EMA does not have very much control over even  some\r\n\r\nstrategic  parts of the whole supply and distribution  chain.\r\n\r\nI  therefore urge the Minister to consider restructuring  the\r\n\r\nplans, to allow EMA to own and manage the strategic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninfrastructure in both electricity and gas distribution.  For\r\n\r\nelectricity, I suggest that EMA take over the managing of the\r\n\r\npower   grid  and,  for  gas,  it  can  take  over  the   gas\r\n\r\ntransportation infrastructures.  The fact is that  these  two\r\n\r\nportions  of  the whole supply chain will not  really  change\r\n\r\nfrom the present infrastructure.  I therefore think that  EMA\r\n\r\nshould  be  the  neutral body owning  these  assets  for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. These infrastructures are strategic in nature and\r\n\r\nthey   directly  affect  the  consumers,  whether  they   are\r\n\r\ncommercial, industrial or domestic.  We should not allow  any\r\n\r\nopportunity for any non-government agency to have too much of\r\n\r\nauthority  and control over national strategic infrastructure\r\n\r\nwhich could also affect our national security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The infrastructure is already fully developed by the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and there is no real reason to  spin  off  these\r\n\r\nassets  as  they  will  not directly  affect  the  intent  of\r\n\r\nliberalising the generation and retail of energy sources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. I do not see why there is a need for developing\r\n\r\nother   alternative  infrastructures  for   distribution   of\r\n\r\nelectricity and gas, as the Singapore market is too small for\r\n\r\none or a few more infrastructure players.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. If we let a private sector run these distribution\r\n\r\nchannels,  there may be problems for generators and retailers\r\n\r\nof  energy sources when all of them compete to use  the  same\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  It is not inconceivable that  if  a  private\r\n\r\ncompany runs the infrastructure, it may lead to some form  of\r\n\r\npreferential  treatment for some generators or retailers,  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of some business relationships that may develop  over\r\n\r\ntime.   It is, therefore, more appropriate for an independent\r\n\r\nentity,  which has the interest of the country,  to  own  and\r\n\r\nmanage  the infrastructure and the Government, or the EMA  as\r\n\r\nthe agency, to do this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to make on this Bill is the\r\n\r\npremise  that  the liberalisation of the energy  sector  will\r\n\r\nlead  to cheaper energy sources.  I hope that this will truly\r\n\r\nbe the case and that all Singaporeans and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore-based companies will enjoy cost reductions for  the\r\n\r\nutilities,  which over the years, have been so high  that  we\r\n\r\nare  paying  even more than countries like the US and  Japan.\r\n\r\nWhile  we  may  think  that the cost of utilities  is  small,\r\n\r\ncompared  to the overall cost of doing business in Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  fact  is  that as we move to the higher technology  type\r\n\r\nindustries  like water fab, petrochemical and  pharmaceutical\r\n\r\nindustries, it is a major cost component.  It is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nvery important that we will successfully create a competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment that will, in the long-term, keep costs of energy\r\n\r\nlow.   In this respect, I hope that the Ministry will be able\r\n\r\nto   create   an  environment  that  supports   true   market\r\n\r\ncompetition  and  not  support  only  what  seems  to  be   a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  landscape  by licensing  only  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point on the Bill is the appointment of members\r\n\r\nof  the Authority.  The Bill provides for up to 10 members to\r\n\r\nbe  appointed  by the Minister.  I suggest that the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider having a good mix of people from the private, public\r\n\r\nand  people sectors to be members of this Authority, as  this\r\n\r\nwill give a diversified perspective of things and also give a\r\n\r\ngood  representation of everyone who will be affected by  the\r\n\r\nchanges to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I support the Bill, subject to some\r\n\r\nquestions which I hope the Acting Minister will answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in asking these questions, I also believe this is\r\n\r\nan  important Bill.  There is basically a growing  belief  in\r\n\r\nmarkets  throughout  the world that privatisation  has  clear\r\n\r\nbenefits.  The benefits of privatisation are especially clear\r\n\r\nwhen  things  have  been  badly  run  by  the  Government  in\r\n\r\ncountries where either there is no power, no water or if some\r\n\r\nthings  are  very bad, then you really see that  markets  and\r\n\r\nprivate   companies   must   come   in.    Fortunately,    or\r\n\r\nunfortunately in that sense, the benefits are not so clear in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  system is relatively good, the  quality  at\r\n\r\npresent  seems relatively assured, and, therefore, focus  has\r\n\r\ntended to be on prices.  A move to privatisation, therefore,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  a  lot  to prove.  Basically, we have to ask  ourselves,\r\n\r\nwhom do we trust.  Do we trust the Government, as a provider,\r\n\r\nas  well as the administrator, or do we provide trust in  the\r\n\r\nmarkets?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other speakers before me have already talked about\r\n\r\ncartels.   I  think  there are some bad stories.   There  are\r\n\r\nconcerns  about petrol companies, as well as things like  the\r\n\r\nDBS  Bank  consolidation with POSBank.  But I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  competition and choice for  consumers  have\r\n\r\nworked    in    some   other   cases   of   note    recently.\r\n\r\nTelecommunications    is   one   clear    case;    similarly,\r\n\r\nsupermarkets.   We  have gained from having foreign  entrants\r\n\r\nand  I  would  say,  perhaps flippantly, on  bookstores  too.\r\n\r\nBorders bookstore has made a tremendous difference over  Time\r\n\r\nand  MPH  before.   In this sense, there is both  a  cautious\r\n\r\noptimism  about  allowing  in foreigners  and  allowing  more\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this caution has to be weighed against the needs.\r\n\r\nI  think  if  we look at the region and the future,  we  have\r\n\r\nconcerns  about energy security, not just our internal  grid,\r\n\r\nbut  the long-term demand and supply in the region and in the\r\n\r\nworld  generally.  If the region does go up economically,  as\r\n\r\nwe  hope,  energy needs will go up and supply may  go  short.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have taken steps in the last  few  months  to\r\n\r\nsecure   fixed  supplies,  such  as  the  natural  gas   from\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   Regional  needs  and  cross-border  supply   and\r\n\r\ngeneration, I think, are the ways of the future.  This  would\r\n\r\nrequire  companies in this sector to be both  big  and  think\r\n\r\nlong-term.  I wonder, Sir, whether privatisation will  really\r\n\r\ncreate  these  companies, or whether Government has  actually\r\n\r\ngot the deep pockets and a long-term vision to lead the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the question of deregulation and\r\n\r\nrestructuring   markets,  we  have  to  be  concerned   about\r\n\r\nefficiencies.   The  crisis recently in California  has  been\r\n\r\nmentioned several times.  I would just like to quickly  share\r\n\r\nmy  view  on  why this happened.  Basically, this is  because\r\n\r\nconsumer prices were fixed by the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs  such,  when demand rose and prices rose, there was  over-demand,  which  could  not be alleviated  by  rising  prices.\r\n\r\nObviously, this should be avoided.  We should have  a  market\r\n\r\nwith   enough   players  and  consumers,  and  a   sufficient\r\n\r\nflexibility in prices that will match the supply and demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while I would encourage not having fixed\r\n\r\nprices,  I  must  recognise there is a  concern  over  rising\r\n\r\ncosts,  especially for households.  In this  light,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to point out one shortcoming of the drafting of clause 6\r\n\r\nin  the Bill.  Looking at clause 6, the closest I can get  to\r\n\r\nthe  question of price is that in clause 6(e).  Here,  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  that  the Bill will protect the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  in respect of the supply and use of electricity  and\r\n\r\ngas  and  the  provision of district cooling services.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is no statement about reasonable prices.  In contrast,\r\n\r\nif  you  look  at  clause 6(c) of the Public Utilities  Bill,\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have just passed, there is a clear statement  here\r\n\r\nthat  one  of the duties of the statutory board would  be  to\r\n\r\nprovide supply at reasonable cost.  I think this is something\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry should address to assuage public concerns\r\n\r\nabout cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, I have got a few points, if I may move on\r\n\r\nquickly.   First, I would like to see a lower  threshold  for\r\n\r\nentry by suppliers to bring sufficient players to the market.\r\n\r\nMany   of   us   have   talked  about  the   large   players.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have got to make accommodation in  the  grid\r\n\r\nfor micro-power and micro-power suppliers.  Every time I pass\r\n\r\nby  the  incineration plant or the refinery  and  I  see  the\r\n\r\nflare, I think that is energy we could have tapped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the consumer choice is a concern. If we have\r\n\r\nflexible   prices  and  competitors,  this  only  makes   any\r\n\r\ndifference if households know about the differences in  price\r\n\r\nand  can switch.  I would like to ask the Minister what would\r\n\r\nbe  the mechanism for alerting consumers, who is the cheapest\r\n\r\nproducer,  supplier,  or  what  are  the  cheapest  times  in\r\n\r\nallowing  them to switch between one supplier and another  in\r\n\r\nreal time, not just month to month or year to year?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third element I would like to point out is\r\n\r\ncompetition policy.  Clause 6(1) creates and imposes upon the\r\n\r\nAuthority the duty to regulate the market, make it  fair  and\r\n\r\nefficient,  that will have effective competition and  prevent\r\n\r\nthe  misuse of monopoly or market power.  Clearly, Sir,  this\r\n\r\nis  going to be a difficult and a new area for Singapore law.\r\n\r\nIt  must  be  tried.  Recently, in this House, we have  heard\r\n\r\nthat  there are international trends that pressure  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  take  on competition policy.  It is a very good  attempt,\r\n\r\nespecially  to  address competition policy  from  a  new  and\r\n\r\npreferably  narrow segment of the market, such as the  supply\r\n\r\nof energy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question of how is something I hope the Acting\r\n\r\nMinister  will  elaborate  upon.  Who  can  complain  to  the\r\n\r\nAuthority  if  he  feels  that there  is  a  monopoly  or  an\r\n\r\ninefficient  market?   Is it consumers or  only  rival  power\r\n\r\ncompanies?  Second, will the duty be questionable  in  courts\r\n\r\nthat  the Authority has not adjudicated properly or  will  it\r\n\r\nonly be by the Authority?  And will there be public hearings?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we have to have a regulatory authority over\r\n\r\ncompetition,  there must be a clear structure  for  different\r\n\r\ncompetitors and stakeholders, like the consumers, to be heard\r\n\r\non  this  issue.   The  fourth issue is on  efficiency.   The\r\n\r\npromotion of power energy efficiency is something many of  us\r\n\r\nhave  emphasised and the move to market is certainly one that\r\n\r\ncan  potentially strengthen the link to efficiency.  But this\r\n\r\nis  only a possibility.  There is the other possibility  that\r\n\r\ncompetition   and  competitors  may  aim  only  for   greater\r\n\r\nconsumption and profit.  What safeguards will we have against\r\n\r\nthis danger?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to make is the question of\r\n\r\nconsumer choice and rights, because this undergirds  a lot of\r\n\r\nthe   things   that  we  are  doing  in  liberalisation   and\r\n\r\nmarketisation.   This Government has been reluctant  to  give\r\n\r\nmuch  more  strength  to  consumer movement  through  a  Fair\r\n\r\nTrading  or  other Act.  If we do leave energy generation  to\r\n\r\nothers  outside of the Government and, potentially,   foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies, I think that this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nidea  of  consumer rights is the necessary  balance  we  must\r\n\r\nbring  into  the creation of the market.  The  consumer  must\r\n\r\nhave a choice, the consumer must have rights.  Only then will\r\n\r\nthe  markets that we are creating have much chance  of  being\r\n\r\ntruly efficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the setting up\r\n\r\nof  the  Energy Marketing Authority of Singapore is a prelude\r\n\r\nto  the  privatisation  of electricity supply  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSoon,  electricity supply entities which are hitherto  solely\r\n\r\nowned  by  the  Government would be split into three  private\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for water supply, almost all the basic public\r\n\r\nservices  have  been privatised.  For a Government  which  is\r\n\r\ngood  at  calculating  profit  and  loss,  the  advantage  of\r\n\r\nprivatisation is that Government does not have to take on the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  providing basic public  services  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   After privatisation, the Government  is  still  the\r\n\r\nmajor shareholder. All the profits earned by these privatised\r\n\r\ncompanies   will  conveniently  flow  into  the  Government's\r\n\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale behind the Government's privatisation\r\n\r\neffort  is  that these companies will be governed  by  market\r\n\r\nforces and, therefore, be cost-effective and efficient. There\r\n\r\nwill be less wastage and the cost would be lower, so that all\r\n\r\nthe  services provided would enjoy better economic  benefits.\r\n\r\nBut the real effect is that, after privatisation, the charges\r\n\r\nfor  all the services will get higher and higher. In the end,\r\n\r\nit is the people who suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the restructuring of the Government hospitals,\r\n\r\nhealth cost escalated, forcing the Government to provide  the\r\n\r\nMedifund to assist Singaporeans who cannot afford the medical\r\n\r\ncharges.     The    result    of   the    privatisation    of\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  is  that consumers  have  to  pay  higher\r\n\r\ncharges. The burden of life is getting heavier and heavier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another wonderful effect of privatisation is that once a\r\n\r\nGovernment corporation is privatised, shares are sold to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   The Government even distributes some of the  shares\r\n\r\nto the people to make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  as  \"shares  for everyone\".  If the charges  go  up,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could justly and forcefully say, \"If the  charges\r\n\r\nare not raised, the company will not make profits, how can we\r\n\r\naccount to the shareholders?\"  Prices are raised so that  the\r\n\r\ncompany can make profits. This argument has become acceptable\r\n\r\nto the shareholding people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's argument is that privatisation is a\r\n\r\nmechanism to introduce competition to the market, to make the\r\n\r\ncharges  for  services  more  reasonable,  and  even   lower.\r\n\r\nHowever,  from  the past experience of privatisation  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  services, it is apparent that the competition brought\r\n\r\nabout by the so-called market mechanism is very limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the privatisation of public transport\r\n\r\nservice.   The  present situation is two bus  companies  each\r\n\r\nsharing  one-half of the pie, with the same  fare  structure.\r\n\r\nTake a look at telecommunications.  SingTel is still the main\r\n\r\ntelephone  service  provider.   Residential  lines  are   all\r\n\r\ncontrolled by SingTel alone.  Newcomers, M1 and Starhub,  can\r\n\r\nonly  compete  in  mobile  phones  and  international  calls.\r\n\r\nYet, the main cables and telecommunications are still in  the\r\n\r\nhands of SingTel. Under this  type of competition, the others\r\n\r\ncan only be the \"also-runs\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privatisation of electricity supply is supposed to\r\n\r\nbring in more companies to enter the market competition. Just\r\n\r\nhow   many   electricity  supply  companies   can   Singapore\r\n\r\naccommodate?  Perhaps  it  is the major  shareholders  -  the\r\n\r\nGovernment competing with itself. Then, with corporatisation,\r\n\r\nelectricity tariffs  are fixed with profit in mind.  I  doubt\r\n\r\nvery much that the electricity tariffs will be really lowered\r\n\r\nin the long run to the benefit of the consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the real purpose of privatisation is to go for\r\n\r\ninvestment  returns, that is, how much profit.  Basic  public\r\n\r\nservices  such  as  public transport,  residential  telephone\r\n\r\nservice and electricity supply are all added with the  profit\r\n\r\nelement. In the end, the consumers will have to pay higher\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharges, and the burden of life will surely be heavier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may think that I am asking the Government to\r\n\r\nsubsidise  public service. No! What I am asking for  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  does not earn the people's  money  from  the\r\n\r\npublic  services.   The Government should provide  the  basic\r\n\r\npublic  service to the people at its operational cost  rather\r\n\r\nthan  profiteering from the privatisation of public  services\r\n\r\nand adding on more burden to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> There have been many issues raised, and\r\n\r\nthey  are  very  complex issues. I would like  to  thank  all\r\n\r\nMembers, but one, who spoke in support of the Bill.  From the\r\n\r\nissues  raised,  one basic question was:  is our  market  too\r\n\r\nsmall to really  support competition and how many players can\r\n\r\nthere  be  to ensure there is real competition?  I think  our\r\n\r\nmarket  is not too small. We are about the same size  as  New\r\n\r\nZealand where privatisation there has been successful. We are\r\n\r\nalso about the same size as a number of Australian states, so\r\n\r\ndo not get away with the idea that we are too small for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how many players can there be, and will there\r\n\r\nbe  a  limit  to  the number of players?  The answer  is  no.\r\n\r\nThere  could  be  as  many players as  they  could  come  on.\r\n\r\nAnother  point that has been made is a caution on the  speed.\r\n\r\nSpeakers  have  expressed concern that we may be  moving  too\r\n\r\nfast.  We are taking this step by step.   What we would  like\r\n\r\nto  point out, first of all, is that although we do not  want\r\n\r\nto  move  too fast and fall on our face,  there is  one  very\r\n\r\nimportant sector of our market which will be opened up  soon,\r\n\r\nie,  the industrial sector which already uses 70-80%  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity.    There   is  already  plenty   of   room   for\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the consumers side, which occupies 20-30%, this would take a bit more time, because they will also\r\n\r\nneed  education  on their choices, and there  are  a  million\r\n\r\naccounts out there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been warned of some of the pitfalls of\r\n\r\nprivatisation, and reference has been made to the DBS-POSBank\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger.  With regard to that reference, this has already been\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  the  House on other occasions.   And  DBS  has\r\n\r\nreiterated  its  commitment  to  continue  providing  banking\r\n\r\nservices that are accessible at affordable prices.   I  think\r\n\r\nit  is not a very fair point to make.  It has no intention of\r\n\r\nleaving  the  mass  market  and service,  and  it  is  facing\r\n\r\nteething problems.  DBS perhaps may have been able to  manage\r\n\r\nthese  transitional problems better, but we could  not  avoid\r\n\r\nthe  most  basic  imperative  to rationalise  retail  banking\r\n\r\nservices and make them economically viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has questioned why do we not let EMA\r\n\r\nown  and  manage the electricity and gas distribution  grids.\r\n\r\nHe  felt  that the EMA should manage the electricity and  gas\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  as  well.   This  matter  has  been   debated\r\n\r\nextensively  when  we  corporatised the electricity  and  gas\r\n\r\nfunctions  in 1995.  There were two options.  One, as  indeed\r\n\r\nsuggested by Mr Inderjit Singh, and the other being  for  the\r\n\r\ngrids  to  be privatised.  The experience in other  countries\r\n\r\nshows  that  this infrastructure can be privately owned,  but\r\n\r\nhas  to be tightly regulated.  As private companies, they can\r\n\r\noperate more flexibly and efficiently, so that they can be as\r\n\r\nefficient  as  the private counterparts and be subject  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount of commercial and financial discipline.   And\r\n\r\nEMA will regulate this infrastructure companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also mentioned the risk of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure companies who deal with generators,  retailers\r\n\r\nand so on.  Indeed, this is why the EMA will be empowered  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  infrastructure companies from participating  in\r\n\r\ngeneration   and  retail,  and  to  prevent  anti-competitive\r\n\r\nbehaviours.   I  will say more of that when  we  explain  the\r\n\r\nElectricity Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure security, I mentioned in my speech that the\r\n\r\nEMA   will  take  over  control  of  the  operations  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity network from Singapore Power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One refrain that we have heard among several speakers\r\n\r\nis:  will competition bring about lower prices?    I think we\r\n\r\nhave   to  be  careful  not  to  confuse  lower  prices  with\r\n\r\ncompetitive prices.  Nobody can guarantee\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlower  prices.  What competition can bring about is to ensure\r\n\r\na framework where there is competition, where there is enough\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, so that it will bring about the prices  that\r\n\r\nwe  would  otherwise  not  be  able  to  obtain  under  other\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern that whatever the number of\r\n\r\nplayers,  there could well be a situation, like some  Members\r\n\r\nhave  referred to, a situation in retail petrol, where it  is\r\n\r\nseen that despite the number of players, there appears to  be\r\n\r\nsome  sort  of  arrangement.  I think we cannot  provide  for\r\n\r\neverything  but,  as we have said, the EMA will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nvigilant.   As  in  the  case of the  unhappiness  over  what\r\n\r\nappears to be collusion among the petrol companies  -    this\r\n\r\nis  not  necessarily so, but it appears  to  be  so   -    my\r\n\r\nMinister  has  already mentioned in the Committee  of  Supply\r\n\r\ndebate  that  this is being looked at.  I think  one  of  the\r\n\r\nstrong  points of Singapore is that we are not rigid, and  we\r\n\r\nare  not  governed by ideology.  And where something  appears\r\n\r\nnot  working, we will step in.  And, of course, privatisation\r\n\r\nis  not a panacea for everything.  But where there is a  need\r\n\r\nto put matters right, they will be put right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thank Mr Simon Tay for pointing out some of the\r\n\r\nclauses  that  may require some looking at.   He  raised  the\r\n\r\npoint  about  who  may  appeal,  and  raised  concerns  of  a\r\n\r\ngrievance.   There  is  no restriction  there.   But  if,  in\r\n\r\npractice, when we find that it is inadequate, then of  course\r\n\r\nwe  will take a look at it again.  There is no restriction of\r\n\r\nwho may or may not raise issues, and make appeals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang, of course, has made his usual point\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  cost of utilities.  He made the  same  point\r\n\r\nthat   we   must   ensure  that  utilities  do   not   become\r\n\r\nunaffordable.  Again, I will give him the same answer that no\r\n\r\namount  of  legislation can guarantee low cost or low  price.\r\n\r\nBut  what  is important is that competition and privatisation\r\n\r\nwill bring about the financial and commercial discipline,  so\r\n\r\nthat  everybody knows what the true cost is.

The first industry-specific legislation is  the\r\n\r\nElectricity  Bill.   This Bill designates the  Energy  Market\r\n\r\nAuthority  of  Singapore  (EMA)  as  the  regulator  of   the\r\n\r\nelectricity industry.  It empowers the EMA to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) set up a competitive industry structure,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) perform licensing and regulatory functions,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) set and enforce performance standards for and regulate prices charged by licensed monopolies, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) set and enforce safety standards and code of practices for the electricity industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Evolving towards a Competitive Energy Market</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all over the world, electricity markets are being\r\n\r\nliberalised  and  made more competitive.  The  experience  in\r\n\r\nother electricity markets that had undergone deregulation has\r\n\r\nbeen  positive, yielding higher efficiency, greater  industry\r\n\r\ninnovation,  wider  choice and better service  to  consumers.\r\n\r\nElectricity  markets  have been successfully  deregulated  in\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and in various\r\n\r\nstates in the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setback in California was unfortunate. The\r\n\r\nCalifornian  market failed because it had not  been  properly\r\n\r\nderegulated.    It   fixed  the  price  consumers   pay   for\r\n\r\nelectricity.   When  electricity wholesale prices  increased,\r\n\r\nits  electricity retailers ended up buying electricity  at  a\r\n\r\nprice  higher  than what they were allowed  to  recover  from\r\n\r\nconsumers.  This pushed the retailers towards insolvency  and\r\n\r\ngeneration   companies,  not  sure  of  getting  paid,   were\r\n\r\nsubsequently reluctant to sell electricity to the Californian\r\n\r\nretailers.  In addition, a combination of other factors  such\r\n\r\nas a surge in electricity demand because of the economic boom\r\n\r\nand  problems in getting new power plants approved created  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where  generation  capacity  was  outstripped   by\r\n\r\ndemand.  Thus, the lights went out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have kept pace with these global developments. We\r\n\r\ntook  the first step towards a liberalised market in 1995  by\r\n\r\ncorporatising  the  electricity and gas undertakings  of  the\r\n\r\nPUB.  We established an electricity wholesale market in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have benefited from these initial steps. The\r\n\r\nwholesale  market  introduced competition in  the  generation\r\n\r\nsector  initially between PowerSeraya, PowerSenoko  and  Tuas\r\n\r\nPower.   The  liberalised generation market attracted  a  new\r\n\r\ngenerator,  SembCorp Cogen who entered the scene using  piped\r\n\r\nnatural gas as a fuel source for power.  Natural gas  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  cleaner, it is also more efficient than fuel oil  which\r\n\r\nwe  currently use.  With the availability of natural gas, the\r\n\r\nliberalised  market  has driven the generation  companies  to\r\n\r\nrethink their strategies in order to stay competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our current market structure includes a\r\n\r\ndominant  Singapore  Power that is actively  engaged  in  all\r\n\r\naspects of the electricity market.  New energy companies  are\r\n\r\nnot prepared to come in to compete with Singapore Power which\r\n\r\nis dominant in the generation sector and is also the monopoly\r\n\r\ngrid owner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Further Restructuring to Enhance Competition</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore decided to push ahead with further\r\n\r\nmarket   liberalisation  to  derive  the  full  benefits   of\r\n\r\ncompetition.    By  1st  April,  the  generation   companies,\r\n\r\nPowerSeraya  and  PowerSenoko,  will  be  divested   out   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Power.   These two companies  together  with  Tuas\r\n\r\nPower   and  SembCorp  Cogen  will  then  compete   to   sell\r\n\r\nelectricity.  A fifth company will be starting up later  this\r\n\r\nyear   and  two  other  generation  companies  are  currently\r\n\r\nplanning to set up generation plants in Singapore.  Hence, we\r\n\r\nwill have more players competing in the generation sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will open more customers to retail competition this\r\n\r\nyear  starting with the large industrial users.   By  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year,  we  expect  to have about  70%  to  80%  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity market opened to retail\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetition.   The  households and small  consumers  will  be\r\n\r\nopened  to competitive retailers by 2003.  The EMA  will  run\r\n\r\nprogrammes to inform and help prepare all customers  who  are\r\n\r\nbeing opened to retail competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the market opens later this year, Singapore Power\r\n\r\nwill  confine  itself to owning, developing, maintaining  and\r\n\r\nproviding services related to the natural monopolies  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry, namely, the electricity and gas grids.  The company\r\n\r\nwould  have  relinquished  all commercial  interests  in  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive parts of the electricity market.  It will then be\r\n\r\nattractive  for  new  entrants to enter and  compete  in  the\r\n\r\nelectricity and gas industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Features of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Electricity Bill before the House\r\n\r\nis   to  create  a  competitive  market  framework  for   the\r\n\r\nelectricity  industry.  It will also provide for the  safety,\r\n\r\ntechnical   and   economic  regulation  of  the   generation,\r\n\r\ntransmission,  supply and use of electricity  and  for  other\r\n\r\nmatters connected to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address the key provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for the EMA to administer the Bill and\r\n\r\nto exercise its functions and duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Control Mechanism and Protection of Consumers' Interest</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 7, 13 and 14 confer powers of licensing to\r\n\r\nthe  EMA.   The  EMA  will license generation,  transmission,\r\n\r\nretailing  and any other electricity business activities  and\r\n\r\ndeal  with  all matters relating to licensing (eg, procedures\r\n\r\nfor  the application for an electricity licence, an extension\r\n\r\nor  an  exemption and matters to be considered in determining\r\n\r\nwhether  to grant or to extend an electricity licence).   The\r\n\r\nEMA   will,   through  licensing,  achieve   the   commercial\r\n\r\nseparation  of  the natural monopolies from  the  competitive\r\n\r\nparts  of the industry and hence pave the way for competition\r\n\r\nto set in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an electricity licensee contravenes any condition of\r\n\r\nlicence,  any provision of the relevant legislation,  or  any\r\n\r\ndirections  issued  by  the EMA,  the  EMA  can  require  the\r\n\r\nlicensee to provide a performance bond and impose a financial\r\n\r\npenalty  not  exceeding  10% of the annual  turnover  of  the\r\n\r\nlicensee's  licensed business, or an amount not exceeding  $1\r\n\r\nmillion, whichever is higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMA may also revoke or suspend the licence if the\r\n\r\nlicensee fails to rectify any contravention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the industry has clear guidelines to work\r\n\r\nwith,  clauses 16 and 46 empower the EMA to issue or  approve\r\n\r\ncodes of practice and other standards of performance for  the\r\n\r\nregulation  of  activities  and conduct  in  the  electricity\r\n\r\nindustry.  They also allow the EMA to make the initial  rules\r\n\r\nin  consultation with industry for establishing and governing\r\n\r\nthe  electricity  market.  The Bill sets out  the  governance\r\n\r\nprocess  for subsequent changes to the market rules  and  for\r\n\r\nthe  rules  to  be published in such manner  as  will  ensure\r\n\r\nadequate publicity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMA is empowered under clause 41 to, with the\r\n\r\napproval  of  the  Minister,  deem  categories  of  consumers\r\n\r\ncontestable.   This will enable the EMA to open consumers  to\r\n\r\ncontestability in phases between this year and the year 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Special Power to Manage Licensees</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 to 30 provide for situations in which public\r\n\r\ninterests   are  put  at  risk.   Under  specific  conditions\r\n\r\nrelating to insolvency of licensees, security and reliability\r\n\r\nof supply or a public emergency, the Minister is empowered to\r\n\r\nmake  a  special  administration  order  directing  that  the\r\n\r\naffairs, business and property of an electricity licensee  be\r\n\r\nmanaged directly or indirectly by the EMA.  The interests  of\r\n\r\nshareholders  and  creditors  of  the  licensee  have  to  be\r\n\r\nprotected in the execution of such an order.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Anti-competition Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill empowers EMA to prohibit anti-competitive\r\n\r\npractices including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions.\r\n\r\nTo  ensure we have a competitive market, it will be necessary\r\n\r\nfor all companies in the electricity market to trade in a way\r\n\r\nthat  is  not anti-competitive as this will otherwise distort\r\n\r\nthe  market  to  the detriment of consumers.  This  principle\r\n\r\nmust  apply regardless of when anti-competitive practices  if\r\n\r\nany,  were put in place.  The anti-competition provisions  in\r\n\r\nPart  VII (clauses 50 to 63) of the Bill will therefore  have\r\n\r\nretrospective effect.  Where the EMA finds that a person  has\r\n\r\nacted  in  an  anti-competitive  manner,  the  EMA  can  give\r\n\r\ndirection  on  the  cessation of such conduct  and  impose  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  penalty on the person.  The person, if  aggrieved,\r\n\r\ncan appeal to an Appeal Panel.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appeal Process</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two kinds of appeals provided for in the Bill.\r\n\r\nFor  grievances relating to market regulation, the  aggrieved\r\n\r\nparty  may  have  their  appeals heard  by  an  Appeal  Panel\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the Minister.  These will include  matters  on\r\n\r\nmodification  of  licence conditions and application  of  the\r\n\r\nanti-competition provisions as stipulated under clause 12 and\r\n\r\nPart  VII  of  the Bill.  The decision of the Panel  will  be\r\n\r\nfinal.   Clauses  64  to  66 provide for  the  establishment,\r\n\r\ncomposition and powers of the Appeal Panel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other types of grievances, eg, refusal to grant a\r\n\r\nlicence  and  matters relating to technical  regulation,  the\r\n\r\naggrieved party may appeal to the Minister whose decision  is\r\n\r\nfinal.  These are set out in clauses 15 and 98.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Electrical  Installations,  Cable  Detection  and  Electrical Workers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant provisions for the licensing of electrical\r\n\r\nworkers   under   the  Electrical  Workers  and   Contractors\r\n\r\nLicensing Act are subsumed, with modifications, under Part IX\r\n\r\n(clauses 67 to 82) of the Bill.  With\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  modifications,  the licensing of electrical  contractors\r\n\r\nwill  be discontinued and regulation of electrical works will\r\n\r\nbe  done  through the licensing of electrical  workers.   The\r\n\r\nElectrical  Workers  and Contractors Licensing  Act  will  be\r\n\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Electricity Bill sets out a broad\r\n\r\nframework  that supports a competitive electricity  industry.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  new regime, market forces are expected  to  exert\r\n\r\npressure  on  market  participants to offer  greater  choice,\r\n\r\nbetter  product innovation and service quality at competitive\r\n\r\nprices.   The  new regime will be friendly to  and  will  not\r\n\r\nunduly  impede  the introduction of new technology,  such  as\r\n\r\nmicro-power or distributed generation nearer to the point  of\r\n\r\nuse.   It  also allows market participants to play a  greater\r\n\r\nrole in formulating market rules and codes of practice.  This\r\n\r\nwould enable EMA to regulate the industry with a light-handed\r\n\r\napproach,  while  ensuring  that energy  solutions  would  be\r\n\r\nmarket-driven  without compromising security and  reliability\r\n\r\nof the electricity system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I rise to support the\r\n\r\nElectricity Bill and wish to confine my comments  briefly  to\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of  competition to be afforded  by  the  proposed\r\n\r\nframework.   Firstly,  few  generation  companies.   As  some\r\n\r\ncolleagues   have   already  raised,   the   scenario   post-liberalisation  will  have  a  relatively  small  number   of\r\n\r\ngeneration companies or Gencos.  Moreover, the Government has\r\n\r\nstated  an intention to divest the three big Gencos,  namely,\r\n\r\nPowerSeraya, PowerSenoko and Tuas Power, which will  generate\r\n\r\nthe  bulk of our needs.  No foreign ownership limit  will  be\r\n\r\nimposed.   In this context, how would the Minister  introduce\r\n\r\nmeaningful competition?  How will the Minister ensure that  a\r\n\r\ncartel-like behaviour, say, in setting full prices, will  not\r\n\r\ndevelop  to  the  detriment  of  suppliers  and,  ultimately,\r\n\r\nconsumers?  As is the allegation against\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noil   companies  supplying  petrol  to  consumers  which  was\r\n\r\nreferred  to earlier on, does this structure lend  itself  to\r\n\r\nsuch anti-competition tendency?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the role of Power Supply. As I understand,\r\n\r\nSir,  the role of the incumbent Power Supply will be  limited\r\n\r\nto  the  provision  of billing and other  customer  services.\r\n\r\nSir,  while  this is meant to bring economies  of  scale  for\r\n\r\nconsumers  as  a whole, it can also be an impediment  to  the\r\n\r\nbundling  of  services by potential retailers.  For  example,\r\n\r\ntelcos who do a fair bit of household-related billing may not\r\n\r\nfind  enough incentives to compete initially as they have  to\r\n\r\ndeal  through Power Supply.  Therefore, I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether there is an intention for the role to be\r\n\r\nplayed  by  Power  Supply to be a permanent  feature  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, first of all, I would like to\r\n\r\ncommend the Ministry for drafting such a comprehensive  Bill.\r\n\r\nI  went through the whole Bill and must say that many of  the\r\n\r\nissues have been well covered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that really needs to happen is that we create\r\n\r\ntrue  competition for those areas which are contestable, that\r\n\r\nis, the power generation and the electricity retail parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  whole  value chain.  I raised my concerns earlier  about\r\n\r\nthe  transmission  and distribution of electricity  which  is\r\n\r\nleft to Singapore Power to manage.  One issue which I have is\r\n\r\nthe  speed of changes in the initial phase.  And if I got  it\r\n\r\nright,   Singapore  Power  will  still  be  responsible   for\r\n\r\ndistribution   as  well  as  certain  parts  of   retail   of\r\n\r\nelectricity.   This  I  feel will put other  retailers  at  a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  and may just slow down the opening  up  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity industry.  The prudent thing to do is right  from\r\n\r\nthe  beginning to spin off the two entities into two separate\r\n\r\ncompanies  with different management control.   Mr  Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  earlier  on brought up the issue of SingTel  managing\r\n\r\nthe  fixed  lines  and  therefore  they  have  the  perpetual\r\n\r\nadvantage  over  other fixed line telephone  operators.   And\r\n\r\nthis  may  result,  again,  in the  electricity  distribution\r\n\r\nsector if we are not careful in separating the roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One issue I fear is also that the Ministry will end up\r\n\r\ngiving licences only to Government-linked companies and  thus\r\n\r\nnot achieve the objective of true liberalisation.  So the new\r\n\r\nGenco  that  came  into  the picture  is  SembCorp  which  is\r\n\r\nactually  a GLC too.  I would like to ask the Acting Minister\r\n\r\nwhether there are any true private companies which have shown\r\n\r\ninterest  to enter our energy market.  How many players  does\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry expect in the short and long term and how  many\r\n\r\ncan our market really support?  The number of players will no\r\n\r\ndoubt  determine the cost of electricity as we move  forward.\r\n\r\nAnother   fear  I  have  on  the  expectations   of   cheaper\r\n\r\nelectricity  as  a result of liberalisation  is  whether  the\r\n\r\nvarious  generators and retailers of electricity  can  really\r\n\r\ndifferentiate to the point that they can really offer cheaper\r\n\r\nelectricity to consumers.  If they are not able to do so  and\r\n\r\nresort  to price wars to win customers, will they be able  to\r\n\r\nsustain  themselves  in the long run by earning  thin  or  no\r\n\r\nmargins  at all?  One thing we must realise is that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a  market  which is too small for many of us to  actually\r\n\r\nattract even foreign interest in our energy market.  We  must\r\n\r\nbe  prepared  that  our companies must be able  and  must  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to supply electricity to other countries as well  as\r\n\r\nto  import electricity from other countries into Singapore to\r\n\r\nprovide everyone with a bigger market to compete in.  In this\r\n\r\nrespect, what is the Ministry's view of allowing retailers to\r\n\r\nbring  electricity from our neighbouring countries, including\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that some day, some of these may be  generated  by\r\n\r\nnuclear means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on a few specific issues on\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.   In  Part  II, clause 3(3)(d)  of  the  Bill,  it\r\n\r\nmentions that prices of licensees have to be controlled.   To\r\n\r\ndo  so,  the  authority will end up limiting the margins  the\r\n\r\nlicensees will be able to achieve.  Because we will be  going\r\n\r\nto  have  multiple sources of electricity, not all  of  which\r\n\r\nwill  be fully controlled by the Government, we will have  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  there  is an overbooking  situation  where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will require a higher supply than the  demand  at\r\n\r\nany one time,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust   in   case  some  of  the  licensees  fail  to  deliver\r\n\r\nelectricity  reliability.   This overbooking  situation  will\r\n\r\nresult  in  higher cost for the licensees and, hence,  higher\r\n\r\nprices  to  the  consumers.  How does the  Ministry  hope  to\r\n\r\nensure there is a good balance of demand and supply?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5(2) of the Bill allows the authority to disclose\r\n\r\ninformation of suppliers of electricity to third  parties  if\r\n\r\nthe  authority  feels that the information  would  not  cause\r\n\r\ndetriment to the supplier.  I feel that this clause should be\r\n\r\namended  to also get the consent of the suppliers before  the\r\n\r\nauthority  releases  any  information,  unless  there  is   a\r\n\r\nnational  security issue involved.  This should be  the  case\r\n\r\nbecause  the authority would never be in a position to  fully\r\n\r\ndetermine  the impact of such information disclosure  on  the\r\n\r\nbusiness of the supplier, especially if the information  goes\r\n\r\nto competition.  This is an important issue if we really want\r\n\r\nto attract private sector companies to come into this field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(7) mentions the fees payable by the licensees.\r\n\r\nCan the Minister share with the House the quantum or range of\r\n\r\nfees  we expect to impose?  I also feel that there is no need\r\n\r\nto  license the transmission part, as I mentioned earlier, as\r\n\r\nthis is not going to be subjected to competition anyway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 24 allows the market support licensee to\r\n\r\ndisconnect  the  supply of electricity,  including  those  of\r\n\r\ndomestic  users.  I would like to suggest that  we  add  some\r\n\r\nsafeguards  in  the  Bill  against  possible  abuse  by  some\r\n\r\nlicensees who may become too quick to disconnect supplies for\r\n\r\nwhatever reasons.  And this may cause inconveniences  to  our\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to touch on the issue of\r\n\r\nreliability of electricity supply.  I did bring this issue up\r\n\r\nduring  the  Committee of Supply and many Members brought  up\r\n\r\nthe  issue of the Californian example.  Specifically, we must\r\n\r\nput   in   place   sufficient  measures  to  hold   licensees\r\n\r\nresponsible  and  accountable when there  are  situations  of\r\n\r\nrecurrent power dips and power failures.  I hope this move to\r\n\r\nliberalise the energy markets\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  not  result  in the drop of the quality and reliability\r\n\r\nof electricity supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I feel that the liberalisation of\r\n\r\nelectricity   is  a  significant  milestone  in   Singapore's\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  it will change the way  we  do  things  and\r\n\r\nchange  the  mindsets about how utilities  are  supplied.   I\r\n\r\npersonally  think that this is a move in the right direction,\r\n\r\nespecially  if we can ensure true market competition.   I  am\r\n\r\nexcited  about  this move and look forward to the  successful\r\n\r\nimplementation of the very aggressive plans that the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas laid out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, allow me to thank the two Members,\r\n\r\nMr  Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, for their support of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  There are again a number of issues raised and some\r\n\r\nof  them  have  to do with the continuing role  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nPower  for  the  distribution  as  well  as  the  retail   of\r\n\r\nelectricity  in  the  initial  phase.   Opening   retail   to\r\n\r\ncompetition is a complicated process and it would take  time.\r\n\r\nThis  has  to  be  done in phases as the  system  has  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared.  For example, meters that are able to register  the\r\n\r\nconsumption  every  half  hourly  will  first  have   to   be\r\n\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 100 large customers are already contestable and,\r\n\r\nlater  this year, we will open up in phases up to 70% or  80%\r\n\r\nof  the electricity market to retail competition.  This  will\r\n\r\nnumber  about  10,000  customers who  are  mainly  the  large\r\n\r\nindustrial and commercial customers.  Power Grid will  indeed\r\n\r\nnot   be  retailing  to  these  contestable  customers.   The\r\n\r\nremaining customers, mainly households, will be opened up  by\r\n\r\n2003,  after  which,  Power Grid will  completely  exit  from\r\n\r\nretailing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remarks have also been made whether or not there are\r\n\r\ntruly  private companies involved, and are they involved  and\r\n\r\nalso  interested  in entering our energy market.   There  are\r\n\r\nalready  two non-GLC private companies issued with generation\r\n\r\nlicences, viz, ExxonMobil and Island Power Company.   In  the\r\n\r\nretail sector, Tractabel was granted a retail licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common refrain on this subject in this House has been\r\n\r\nhow  would electricity consumers benefit from the electricity\r\n\r\nindustry's restructuring, and how would the liberalisation of\r\n\r\nthe market lead to cheaper electricity.  We must say that the\r\n\r\nbenefits   would  be  the  benefits  brought  about   through\r\n\r\ncompetition   -   choice  of  supply,  competitive   pricing,\r\n\r\nincluding,  most  importantly, innovative pricing.   We  have\r\n\r\nreceived  feedback  from  several MNCs,  such  as  Shell  and\r\n\r\nSumitomo, that peak and off-peak tariffs have a wider  spread\r\n\r\nin  liberalised markets overseas than there are  here.   This\r\n\r\nallows  users,  especially large users, to  plan  their  work\r\n\r\nschedules  to benefit from the reduced off-peak  prices.   We\r\n\r\nexpect competition to create this type of benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim also wanted to know how would consumers enjoy\r\n\r\ndifferent  service packages and products.  This is really  up\r\n\r\nto  the ingenuity of the retailers.  Experience, again,  from\r\n\r\nother  countries, shows that electricity can be bundled  with\r\n\r\nother  products,  such as appliances.  Retailers  could  also\r\n\r\noffer  electricity  packages  that  are  customised  to   the\r\n\r\ncustomers'  needs  at  different  levels  of  pricing.   This\r\n\r\nincludes  lower  off-peak  rates, power  management  schemes,\r\n\r\nbundling   of   electricity   with   other   services    like\r\n\r\ntelecommunications,   and  shielding   its   customers   from\r\n\r\nfluctuations  in  electricity prices with  financial  hedging\r\n\r\ninstruments.    The  competitive  market  will   drive   such\r\n\r\ninnovations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions and concerns have also been asked and\r\n\r\nexpressed  whether  there  would be  enough  players  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket,  and how are we to ensure that there is no  collusion\r\n\r\nas  our  market  may be too small.  I have already  explained\r\n\r\nthat  our market is not too small.  Are we prepared to import\r\n\r\nand  export  electricity?   Our generation  capacity  is  6.6\r\n\r\ngigawatts  today.  Demand is growing by 4%-6% per annum.   In\r\n\r\n10 years, our system will reach 10 gigawatts.  This is not  a\r\n\r\nsmall  system.   New  Zealand and the State  of  Victoria  in\r\n\r\nAustralia  liberalised  when  their  capacity  was  about   7\r\n\r\ngigawatts each.  Our market is thus of a sufficient  size  to\r\n\r\nallow  for  competition and attract more players,  local  and\r\n\r\nforeign.  For this to occur, EMA will have to ensure a level\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaying field and prevent anti-competitive behaviour, such as\r\n\r\ncollusion,  which  the  Member  has  mentioned.   Like  other\r\n\r\nmarkets  that have liberalised, we will allow electricity  to\r\n\r\nbe  imported or exported, so long as the system's security is\r\n\r\nnot compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been asked how the licence fees are\r\n\r\ndetermined.   The licence fees will be set to enable  EMA  to\r\n\r\nrecover its costs of administering this industry legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also concern expressed about quality. Will\r\n\r\nthe  restructuring exacerbate the problem of power dips,  and\r\n\r\nshould  Singapore Power not be made liable  for  causing  the\r\n\r\ndips?   Mr Inderjit Singh again expressed concern about  this\r\n\r\nproblem, as he has done so in the Committee of Supply on  8th\r\n\r\nMarch.  We had explained the slew of measures that have  been\r\n\r\ntaken  to  reduce  power dips.  As for  liability,  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  matter between Singapore Power and  the  affected\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern about how prices would be fixed\r\n\r\nand what the formula is.  The current tariffs comprise a fuel\r\n\r\ncomponent and a non-fuel component.  At the moment, we  allow\r\n\r\nSingapore  Power  to  set the non-fuel  tariff  component  at\r\n\r\nlevels  which  allow  them to earn a 7%-8%  return  on  total\r\n\r\nassets.  A price cap is applied to subsequent adjustments  to\r\n\r\nthis non-fuel tariff component.  The price cap depends on the\r\n\r\nrate  of  inflation  and productivity improvements,  ie,  the\r\n\r\nconsumer price index  minus a factor of \"X\".  In other words,\r\n\r\nthe  non-fuel  tariff component cannot be increased  by  more\r\n\r\nthan   the  inflation  rate  minus  an  imposed  productivity\r\n\r\nimprovement  factor which Singapore Power has to deliver  and\r\n\r\npass  through  to  consumers.  As to the fuel  component,  of\r\n\r\ncourse  we buy our fuel from global markets, with no  control\r\n\r\nover  fuel  prices.   The pricing formula, therefore,  allows\r\n\r\nchanges  in fuel prices to pass through but, as we  mentioned\r\n\r\nseveral  times, in order to alleviate hardship for those  who\r\n\r\nmay not be able to afford, the Government has already given a\r\n\r\nnumber of assistance schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also refers to clause 5(2) of the Bill\r\n\r\nand suggests that consent of suppliers be obtained before any\r\n\r\ninformation is released.  The Bill does allow EMA to disclose\r\n\r\ninformation of suppliers of electricity to third parties,  if\r\n\r\nEMA  feels that the information would not cause detriment  to\r\n\r\nthe  suppliers.  In fact, this will require EMA to check with\r\n\r\nthe suppliers before divulging the information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Peter Chen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 10, line 14, to leave out \"or ancillary\r\n\r\nservices.\",  and insert \", ancillary services  or  any  other\r\n\r\nelectricity related products or services.\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Electricity Bill defines the \"wholesale electricity\r\n\r\nmarket\"  as  an electricity market established by the  market\r\n\r\nrules  for  the trading of electricity or ancillary services.\r\n\r\nWe  anticipate  that  there will be  new  electricity-related\r\n\r\nproducts and services created over time, which will add value\r\n\r\nto  our market and which we would like to encourage.

As  I  mentioned  earlier,  natural   gas   will\r\n\r\nincreasingly  become an important source of  fuel  for  power\r\n\r\ngeneration.   Currently, a small amount  of  natural  gas  is\r\n\r\nimported from Malaysia for power generation only.  In January\r\n\r\nthis year, SembGas took delivery of natural gas from the West\r\n\r\nNatuna  gas  fields in the South China Sea  under  a  22-year\r\n\r\nagreement  with  Pertamina, for the purchase  of  up  to  325\r\n\r\nmillion standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of natural  gas.\r\n\r\nLast month, Singapore Power signed a gas sales agreement with\r\n\r\nPertamina, to import up to 350 mmscfd of natural gas over  20\r\n\r\nyears  from  the Asamera gas fields in Sumatra.  The  Asamera\r\n\r\ngas is scheduled for delivery in 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While natural gas can be used for different purposes,\r\n\r\nits  main use will be for power generation.  The natural  gas\r\n\r\nindustry  has  to  be  structured such that  no  company  can\r\n\r\ncommercially advantage or disadvantage other competing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies.  If  this  happens,  it  will  be  detrimental  to\r\n\r\ncompetition in the electricity industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gas importing is a competitive business. Natural gas\r\n\r\ncan  only  be  transported  from importers  to  end-consumers\r\n\r\nthrough  on-shore gas pipelines.  The company that owns  this\r\n\r\ntransport  network connecting the gas importers to  the  end-customers   is   a   monopoly,  and  can  potentially   wield\r\n\r\nconsiderable advantage over competitors, if it has  competing\r\n\r\ninterests  elsewhere.  To avoid this, we  are  setting  up  a\r\n\r\nmarket  structure where the monopoly transporter of gas  does\r\n\r\nnot engage in the competitive sectors of the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Power will remain in the monopoly business of\r\n\r\ntransporting  gas  within Singapore.  To  do  this  it  will,\r\n\r\nthrough  PowerGas,  own, maintain and  develop  the  on-shore\r\n\r\npipelines that form the gas grid.  Singapore Power will  exit\r\n\r\nfrom  importing  and retailing of natural gas  to  industrial\r\n\r\ncustomers and power plants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a pipe network which supplies town gas to\r\n\r\ndomestic and industry consumers.  Town gas, which is supplied\r\n\r\nby  PowerGas,  will not be competitive, compared  to  natural\r\n\r\ngas.  PowerGas plans to convert the town gas network over the\r\n\r\nnext  five years to convey natural gas, so that domestic  and\r\n\r\nsmall  consumers will also benefit from it.  Other  consumers\r\n\r\nnot  using  piped  gas will still have the  option  of  using\r\n\r\ncommercially  available LPG.  After converting the  town  gas\r\n\r\nnetwork  to  natural  gas,  PowerGas  will  also  exit   from\r\n\r\nretailing gas to domestic and small customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is currently a natural gas pipe network in Jurong,\r\n\r\nwhich  was developed and owned by SembGas.  As SembGas is  an\r\n\r\nimporter and retailer of natural gas, it would have  to  exit\r\n\r\nfrom  the  business of transporting natural gas and  transfer\r\n\r\nits pipeline assets to PowerGas.  When these various measures\r\n\r\nare  implemented, there will then be competition  in  natural\r\n\r\ngas import and retailing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Diversifying Sources of Gas Supply</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have three sources of fuel for power generation.\r\n\r\nThe  primary  fuels  will be oil and natural  gas.   All  the\r\n\r\ngeneration plants using natural gas are required to  be  able\r\n\r\nto  be operated with diesel.  Diesel will serve as a back  up\r\n\r\nfuel in case of disruption to the gas supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, we plan to further diversify our sources\r\n\r\nof  fuel.   Land has been set aside in Tuas for  a  Liquefied\r\n\r\nNatural  Gas  (LNG) terminal to allow import of  LNG  by  LNG\r\n\r\ntankers  to Singapore.  With this terminal, we would be  able\r\n\r\nto  tap  natural  gas supplies from further sources  such  as\r\n\r\nAustralia and the Middle East.  A joint study by PUB, MTI and\r\n\r\nEDB is currently underway.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Features of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now deal with the main\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Gas  Bill.  The  Bill  is  to  create  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  market  framework for  the  gas  industry,  make\r\n\r\nprovisions  for the safety, technical and economic regulation\r\n\r\nof the transportation and retail of gas and for other matters\r\n\r\nconnected therewith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Electricity Bill, the Gas Bill designates the\r\n\r\nEnergy  Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) as the  regulator\r\n\r\nof the gas industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions and duties of the EMA under the Bill\r\n\r\nincludes protecting the interests of the consumers, promoting\r\n\r\ncompetition in the supply of natural gas, regulating  prices,\r\n\r\nas well as establishing and monitoring technical, performance\r\n\r\nand safety standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Control Mechanism and Protection of Consumers' Interests</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 to 19 of the Gas Bill allow the EMA to issue\r\n\r\nlicences   and  administer  the  controls  related   to   the\r\n\r\nlicensing.   The conveying of gas through a gas pipeline  and\r\n\r\nthe retailing of gas will be licensed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who carries out any work on any gas\r\n\r\ninstallation or gas appliance will also need to  be  licensed\r\n\r\nas a gas service worker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a gas licensee contravenes any conditions of its\r\n\r\nlicence, any provisions of the relevant legislation,  or  any\r\n\r\ndirections issued by the EMA, the EMA is empowered to require\r\n\r\nthe  licensee  to provide a performance bond;  and  impose  a\r\n\r\nfinancial penalty not exceeding 10% of the annual turnover of\r\n\r\nthe  licensee's licensed business, or an amount not exceeding\r\n\r\n$1 million, whichever is higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMA may also revoke or suspend the licence if the\r\n\r\nlicensee  fails to comply with its direction to  rectify  any\r\n\r\ncontravention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 62 to 68 empower the regulator to issue or\r\n\r\napprove  codes of practice and performance standards for  the\r\n\r\nregulation  of  activities  and  conduct  in  the  piped  gas\r\n\r\nindustry.   They  also  deal  with  safety  requirements   in\r\n\r\nrelation to gas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Duties of Gas Licensees</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill lays out the duties of licensees. Licensees\r\n\r\nare  required to carry out their licensed business in such  a\r\n\r\nmanner  so  as  not  to  prevent,  restrict  or  hinder   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of competition in any gas market in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Special Power</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the Electricity Bill, the Gas Bill also provides\r\n\r\nfor  situations in which public interests are  put  at  risk.\r\n\r\nClauses  33  to  35 empower the Minister to  make  a  special\r\n\r\nadministration order, upon application by the EMA,  directing\r\n\r\nthat  the  affairs, business and property of  an  electricity\r\n\r\nlicensee be managed directly or indirectly by the EMA.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Anti-competition Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Electricity Bill, the Gas Bill has similar\r\n\r\nprovisions to control anti-competitive behaviour.  These  are\r\n\r\nlisted in Part IX of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appeal Process</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for appeals. Appeals relating to\r\n\r\nmarket  regulation will be heard by an Appeal Panel appointed\r\n\r\nby  the Minister.  These will include matters on modification\r\n\r\nof licence conditions and application of the anti-competition\r\n\r\nprovisions as stipulated under clause 17 and Part IX  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  The decision of the Panel shall be final.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other types of appeals, eg, refusal to grant a licence\r\n\r\nand  matters relating to technical regulation, will go to the\r\n\r\nMinister whose decision is final.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transitional Provisions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural gas pipelines in Jurong which are owned by\r\n\r\nSembGas will have to be transferred to PowerGas on commercial\r\n\r\nterms.     If  the  parties  cannot  achieve  a  satisfactory\r\n\r\ncommercial  settlement, clause 98 of the  Bill  empowers  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  intervene and ensure that  the  transfer  takes\r\n\r\nplace.   This provision will not be invoked unless absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Gas Bill is to give effect to the restructured\r\n\r\npiped  gas  industry.  With this, we hope that big and  small\r\n\r\nconsumers  will benefit from higher efficiency,  more  choice\r\n\r\nand  better  service of piped gas supply.  As the  regulator,\r\n\r\nthe EMA will be responsible to safeguard the interests of the\r\n\r\nconsumers and ensure a level playing field for the players in\r\n\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have two specific issues to\r\n\r\nraise.   The first issue is whether there is a real  need  to\r\n\r\nseparate  the  generating  and  retailing  portions  of   the\r\n\r\nindustry.  From the way I look at, all we need is one type of\r\n\r\nlicence for both generation and supply of gas, making use  of\r\n\r\na transport system managed by an independent authority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is one of continuity of supply. My\r\n\r\nfear is that we may have a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsituation  of  over-reliance on one or two  sources  of  gas,\r\n\r\nespecially the gas we are purchasing from Indonesia,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister mentioned earlier.  Are we doing enough to diversify\r\n\r\nour risk?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these two issues, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh has raised the concern\r\n\r\nand  question  of  separating generation  and  retail.   Both\r\n\r\ngeneration  and retail can indeed be performed  by  the  same\r\n\r\ncompany,  as Mr Inderjit Singh has quite rightly  said.   But\r\n\r\nthere is nothing to stop a company from doing both.  And  the\r\n\r\nfact  is that there will be companies that will choose to  do\r\n\r\ngeneration  without retailing or vice-versa.  The transporter\r\n\r\nis  the  owner  of  the  gas pipelines  and  can  potentially\r\n\r\ninfluence  the  competition  in  the  generation  and  retail\r\n\r\nsectors.  Hence, the transporter would not be allowed to take\r\n\r\npart in the generation or retail.  The transporter has to  be\r\n\r\nlicensed, as it is a monopoly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern expressed by Mr Inderjit Singh\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  security of supply.  Sir, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nthank  Mr Inderjit Singh for speaking in support of the  Bill\r\n\r\nand  also raising this concern.  The key is to diversify  our\r\n\r\nsources.   Not all electricity will be generated  by  natural\r\n\r\ngas.   Oil will continue to be a significant source for power\r\n\r\ngeneration.    In  any case, our natural gas  agreements  are\r\n\r\ncommercial   agreements  and  international   companies   and\r\n\r\norganisations  like the World Bank are involved.   They  will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  ensure  that  they  are  able  to  discharge  their\r\n\r\ncontractual  obligations.    In  the  longer  term,  we  will\r\n\r\neventually  go to LNG as I have said.  Land has already  been\r\n\r\nset  aside in Tuas for the LNG terminal.  There is  a  global\r\n\r\nmarket  for  LNG  and this will allow us to tap  natural  gas\r\n\r\nsupply  from global sources much further afield,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned, Australia and the Middle East.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.  -  [Mr Peter Chen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DISTRICT COOLING BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the District Cooling Bill is another industry-specific legislation that will be administered by the Energy\r\n\r\nMarket  Authority of Singapore (EMA).  The main objective  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  is to designate the EMA as the regulator  for  the\r\n\r\nprovision of a pilot district cooling service in an  area  at\r\n\r\nthe New Downtown at Marina South.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A district cooling system supplies chilled water through\r\n\r\na  network  of  pipes for the air-conditioning  of  buildings\r\n\r\nlocated within the service area.  The conventional method  is\r\n\r\nto have individual buildings put up their own stand-alone air-conditioning  plants.  A centralised district cooling  system\r\n\r\nhas  two major benefits.  First, it takes up less land space,\r\n\r\nan important consideration in land-scarce Singapore.  Second,\r\n\r\nit significantly reduces water and energy consumption through\r\n\r\neconomies of scale.  There is also an aesthetic advantage, as\r\n\r\nthe  roof-tops  of  individual buildings can  now  be  better\r\n\r\ndesigned, besides being put to better use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Cooling Systems have been successfully\r\n\r\nimplemented in certain parts of Yokohama and Osaka of  Japan.\r\n\r\nBased  on  such  experience, the advice is  that  a  District\r\n\r\nCooling System should serve a total gross floor area of about\r\n\r\n1.25  million square metres for optimal efficiency.  URA  has\r\n\r\ntherefore  parceled  out a section of  the  New  Downtown  at\r\n\r\nMarina South for a pilot District Cooling System to be  tried\r\n\r\nout.   The projected saving in gross floor area in the  pilot\r\n\r\narea is about 7,000 square metres.  The remainder of the  New\r\n\r\nDowntown can be parceled out into four zones of similar  size\r\n\r\nfor  future  District Cooling Systems, if  the  pilot  proves\r\n\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the high capital and operating cost, the district\r\n\r\ncooling  system will be viable only if all buildings  in  the\r\n\r\nservice area subscribe to it.  As some building\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nowners  may be unfamiliar with this new centralised  service,\r\n\r\nthey may choose to stick to the conventional air-conditioning\r\n\r\nplant.   This would increase the operating cost of a district\r\n\r\ncooling  system.   To reap the full benefits  of  economy  of\r\n\r\nscale  of  such  a  system, it is necessary  to  require  all\r\n\r\nbuilding  owners in this zone to subscribe to  it.   We  have\r\n\r\nmade the use of this service mandatory by specifying this  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government  land sale condition for the designated  land\r\n\r\nparcels  in  Marina  South.  In Japan, the  use  of  District\r\n\r\nCooling System in designated areas is also mandated.\r\n\r\nSince  we  have  made the use of the district cooling  system\r\n\r\nmandatory for this pilot phase in Marina South, we  must  use\r\n\r\nGovernment regulation to safeguard the interests of  building\r\n\r\nowners and users.  The users of this cooling system must  not\r\n\r\nbe  subject  to high charges or poor service by the  monopoly\r\n\r\noperator.   EMA  will regulate this service  provided  by  an\r\n\r\noperator.   The  operator will be price regulated  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the cost of cooling using this centralised system would\r\n\r\nbe  lower than that using conventional methods.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nensure  a passing-through to consumers of some of the savings\r\n\r\nfrom  using  a centralised cooling system.  Price  regulation\r\n\r\nwill  also  encourage  it  to  improve  its  efficiency   and\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Key Features of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now touch on the main provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill.  Clauses 3 and 4 spell out the functions and duties  of\r\n\r\nEMA as the regulator of the district cooling industry.  These\r\n\r\ninclude, inter alia, the:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) granting of licences, monitoring licensees'\r\n\r\nperformance  and enforcing compliance with licences  and  the\r\n\r\nrelevant provisions provided in the Bill;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) regulating prices of the operator within its\r\n\r\nservice area; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) establishing, monitoring and enforcing technical and\r\n\r\nperformance standards and codes of practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Mandatory Use of District Cooling Services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides for the Minister to declare, by\r\n\r\nnotification  in  the Government Gazette, an  area  to  be  a\r\n\r\nservice  area  wherein district cooling services  are  to  be\r\n\r\nprovided  and  consumers have to subscribe  to  the  service.\r\n\r\nClauses   8  and  9  outline  the  Minister's  authority   in\r\n\r\nconnection with making changes to the service areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Control Mechanism and Protection of Consumers' Interest</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 13 stipulate that any person who provides\r\n\r\ndistrict cooling in the designated area must be authorised by\r\n\r\na  licence  granted by the EMA.  The provisions also  provide\r\n\r\nfor the circumstances where the EMA may suspend or cancel the\r\n\r\nlicence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the regulator is satisfied that a district cooling\r\n\r\nlicensee  has  contravened any condition of its licence,  any\r\n\r\nprovision  of the Bill or any direction issued, the regulator\r\n\r\nis empowered to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) require a licensee to provide a performance bond;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) impose a financial penalty not exceeding 10% of the\r\n\r\nannual turnover derived from the district cooling services of\r\n\r\nthe licensee in Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) require the licensee to replace its management with\r\n\r\nappointees approved by the Regulator; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) cancel the licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 14 to 16, the district cooling licensee is\r\n\r\nrequired to comply with the codes of practice and performance\r\n\r\nstandards issued or approved by the regulator.  The regulator\r\n\r\nmay  also give direction to its licensee to observe the  code\r\n\r\nof practice and keep to the performance standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 specifies the general duties of a licensee,\r\n\r\nwhich are to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) maintain a reliable, efficient and economical\r\n\r\ndistrict cooling system;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) ensure public safety with respect to the provision\r\n\r\nof district cooling services;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) ensure that it will not do or not omit to do any\r\n\r\nact which will adversely affect the reliability and stability\r\n\r\nof the services provided to consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 ensures that the prices to be charged by a\r\n\r\nlicensee and which are to be paid by its customers must be in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the conditions of its licence.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nprices  will  be regulated and can be reviewed  by  the  EMA.\r\n\r\nThis clause also disallows the licensee, in fixing prices for\r\n\r\nits  service,  to  give undue preference to  or  discriminate\r\n\r\namongst its customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Special Power</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions under clauses 21 to 23 empower the\r\n\r\nMinister   to  make  a  special  administration  order   upon\r\n\r\napplication  by the regulator.  The order would  direct  that\r\n\r\nthe affairs, business and property of the licensee be managed\r\n\r\nby  any  person  appointed by the Minister  if  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsiders  it  necessary  in the  interest  of  security  and\r\n\r\nreliability of the provision of district cooling services, or\r\n\r\nin the public interest, among other circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appeal Process</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 42 outlines the appeal process. Any person\r\n\r\naggrieved by any decision of the regulator in the exercise of\r\n\r\nits  powers  under the Bill may appeal to the Minister  whose\r\n\r\ndecision is final.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will provide safeguards to protect the\r\n\r\ninterests of consumers in the pilot district cooling  project\r\n\r\nin  Marina  South. The mandatory requirement is necessary  to\r\n\r\nget  the  pilot project off the ground.  As the  benefits  of\r\n\r\ndistrict  cooling become better known to Singapore consumers,\r\n\r\nwe  hope  to lift such mandatory requirement.  The experience\r\n\r\nin Marina South will also help us decide if there is any need\r\n\r\nat  all  in future to extend such a mandatory requirement  to\r\n\r\nother  new developments in Singapore in order to promote  the\r\n\r\ngreater use of district cooling systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the District Cooling\r\n\r\nBill is introduced to enable the Minister to declare that  it\r\n\r\nis  mandatory  for the occupiers of premises in a  designated\r\n\r\narea  to use district cooling.  The idea of district cooling,\r\n\r\nas  I  understand  it, is that cooling or  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nairconditioning in an area is provided by a central facility.\r\n\r\nDistrict  cooling works on the assumption that a  centralised\r\n\r\nfacility will be more efficient, enjoy lower cost due to  the\r\n\r\nhigher  economies  of scale and sharing of  common  services.\r\n\r\nSir, I support this Bill in view of this potential benefit of\r\n\r\ndistrict cooling.  However, I do  have some concerns which  I\r\n\r\nwould like the Acting Minister to clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concept has been talked about for several\r\n\r\nyears,  but this is new and untested in Singapore.   My  main\r\n\r\nconcern is that the structure is too rigid.  To make it work,\r\n\r\nthe  system  has  to be made mandatory so  that  everyone  is\r\n\r\nforced  to use it.  This means that the operator of  district\r\n\r\ncooling  services  is  a monopoly in a designated  area.   So\r\n\r\nthere  are the evils of monitoring and regulating a monopoly.\r\n\r\nAs  it  is,  being the sole proprietor of a cooling facility,\r\n\r\nany  failure  of  the  system means that  there  will  be  no\r\n\r\nalternative.   We  may say that it is not a life  threatening\r\n\r\nevent if no airconditioning is provided.  When the system  is\r\n\r\ndown,  people  just get hot, or hot under the collar,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak.  However, I want to point out that in a modern office,\r\n\r\nairconditioning is very important to keep the computers cool,\r\n\r\nnot the human beings as such.  If the computers are down, the\r\n\r\ncompanies may lose very valuable electronic data.  The damage\r\n\r\nmay be very severe, or even irreparable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed idea is to do a pilot test of the\r\n\r\nconcept  in  the new phase one of Marina South  area.   I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  that the compulsory district cooling system  there\r\n\r\nmay  affect  the  tender prices, as it  is  perceived  as  an\r\n\r\nadditional cost, rigidity of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  system  or  concerns  about  how  the  system  would  be\r\n\r\nperceived by prospective buyers or tenants of the premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prospective tenants may be deterred to move into an\r\n\r\noffice  area  if  they  have to incur  higher  fitting  cost.\r\n\r\nCompared to the current situation, the tenants and owners  of\r\n\r\nthe  premises have a varied number of choices,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nwhether to use central airconditioning, split unit, room unit\r\n\r\nor even window unit.  In district cooling, the occupiers have\r\n\r\nonly  one  choice.   It is like in transportation.   You  can\r\n\r\nchoose  to  go  by  MRT, to take a bus,  taxi,  car  or  even\r\n\r\nbicycle.   But  in the case of central district  cooling,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  do anything else but take the MRT, and MRT in itself,\r\n\r\nas  a  single system, although it is faster, is actually more\r\n\r\nrigid and restricted in its coverage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not sure how the central district cooling\r\n\r\nsystem  would  be constructed, but I would imagine  that  the\r\n\r\nsystem   requires  an  extensive  infrastructure  of  piping,\r\n\r\nfeeding out from a central cooling plant.  If an end user  is\r\n\r\nlocated  far  away, there will be loss of cooling efficiency,\r\n\r\nloss of energy efficiency and maybe even higher pumping cost.\r\n\r\nHence,  I  am  not  yet persuaded that the  district  cooling\r\n\r\nsystem can be more efficient and will be able to enjoy  lower\r\n\r\nenergy and other operating costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a central facility needs more physical space, and\r\n\r\nmaybe more costs for the extensive piping and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nVisually,  I  think  it can also create aesthetic  and  noise\r\n\r\nproblems.   Ultimately, it may not lead to lower  prices  for\r\n\r\nthe consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last point is to ask the Acting Minister why the\r\n\r\nneed to enact a law to specially deal with this concept.  Why\r\n\r\nnot  just  simply deal with it as a section  within  the  new\r\n\r\nEnergy Market Authority law?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I end by saying that I support this\r\n\r\nBill in its intent, since it will bring the novel concept  of\r\n\r\ndistrict  cooling  for the benefit of the  occupiers  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding.   But may the Acting Minister address my  concerns,\r\n\r\nSir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Sir, let me thank Mr Leong Horn Kee for\r\n\r\nsupporting  the  Bill  in the first place.   Let  me  try  to\r\n\r\naddress some of his concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if we look at the successful application of the\r\n\r\ndistrict cooling system in some other countries, we might get\r\n\r\nsome   assurance.    District   cooling   system   has   been\r\n\r\nsuccessfully implemented in several countries like  the  USA,\r\n\r\nFrance  and  Japan.   Some of the notable  areas  are   Reedy\r\n\r\nCreek,  Florida,  Paris, France, etc. As regards  alternative\r\n\r\nand  fail safe systems, the EMA can specify various standards\r\n\r\nas part of the licensing conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong has also raised some concerns on whether or not\r\n\r\na  mandatory  imposition  of district  cooling  system  would\r\n\r\ndiscourage potential investors in tendering for the land sale\r\n\r\nin  Marina  South.   This is quite unlikely.   In  fact,  the\r\n\r\ntender  for  the first land sale in Marina South  was  closed\r\n\r\nonly  three  days ago.  This site will eventually  house  the\r\n\r\ndistrict  cooling system plant, which the successful tenderer\r\n\r\nhas to provide space for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;URA received two offers for the land parcel. And as the\r\n\r\ndistrict  cooling  system is a new concept in  Singapore,  it\r\n\r\nwill   be  quite  natural  in  the  beginning  for  potential\r\n\r\ntenderers  to  ask a lot of questions and inquire  about  the\r\n\r\ndetails.   But  the feedback is that most of  the  developers\r\n\r\nwere  receptive  to  the idea of district  cooling  services.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, some of the building owners in the existing CBD\r\n\r\narea,  who plan to overhaul their stand-alone airconditioning\r\n\r\nsystems,  have also inquired whether they could tap from  the\r\n\r\npilot district cooling system plant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the problem of noise and aesthetics, there are\r\n\r\nsolutions to overcome them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked why do we need an Act to effect all\r\n\r\nthese, and why can this not be controlled under the EMA.  The\r\n\r\nEnergy  Market  Authority  of Singapore  Bill  serves  as  an\r\n\r\numbrella  Act that empowers the EMA to administrate  industry\r\n\r\nspecific  legislation, one of which is the  District  Cooling\r\n\r\nBill.   The  Bill is structured in this way because different\r\n\r\nindustries have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent   requirements,  and  therefore  require  different\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.  -  [Mr Peter Chen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONTROL OF RENT (ABOLITION) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to abolish rent control in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Rent  control operates in two ways.   First,  it\r\n\r\nrestricts  a landlord's right to raise the rent.  Second,  it\r\n\r\nrestricts the landlord's right to take back possession of the\r\n\r\nrent-controlled property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of rent control goes back to 1947, just\r\n\r\nafter  the Second World War.  At that time, much of the basic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  like  roads  and  utilities   were   severely\r\n\r\ndamaged.   Housing was in short supply.  The  population  had\r\n\r\nrisen  sharply, especially with a massive influx of refugees.\r\n\r\nAgainst this backdrop, rent control was introduced to prevent\r\n\r\nlandlords  from  exploiting the situation and  raising  rents\r\n\r\ndrastically.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Why rent control is no longer needed</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation today is totally different. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  successfully implemented its public  housing\r\n\r\nprogramme  to  provide affordable housing  for  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nAlmost   nine  in  10  Singaporeans  now  own  their   homes.\r\n\r\nSubsidised  rental flats are available for  those  who  still\r\n\r\ncannot  afford home ownership.  No family need go  without  a\r\n\r\nroof  over  its  head.  After 54 years,  rental  control  has\r\n\r\noutlived  its  purpose to protect families from  unscrupulous\r\n\r\nlandlords.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, rent control is a disincentive for\r\n\r\nlandlords  to  redevelop or restore  their  properties.   The\r\n\r\nControlled  Premises (Special Provisions) Act was  introduced\r\n\r\nin  1970  to allow landlords to recover their rent-controlled\r\n\r\nproperties  for  redevelopment.  However,  as  landlords  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to pay compensation to the tenants, some  landlords\r\n\r\nhave  not  moved to recover their rent-controlled properties.\r\n\r\nAs a result, some rent-controlled properties, including those\r\n\r\ndesignated  for  conservation, remain  in  a  poor  state  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance.  The complete lifting of rent control will  give\r\n\r\nlandlords  additional incentive to recover  their  properties\r\n\r\nand to spruce them up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Paving the way to rent decontrol</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1997, the Government announced its intention to\r\n\r\nabolish  rent control in four years' time, that  is,  on  1st\r\n\r\nApril  this  year.  This long period of notice  was  to  give\r\n\r\nsufficient  time for tenants to find alternative premises  or\r\n\r\nto  reach  agreement with their landlords to  stay  on  after\r\n\r\nlifting of rent control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early announcement in 1997 aimed to strike a balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the  interests of the tenants and  their  landlords.\r\n\r\nTenants were assured that they could continue to pay low rent\r\n\r\nand  stay in the rent-controlled properties for another  four\r\n\r\nyears  while  landlords  were  given  indication  that  their\r\n\r\nproperties  would cease to be rent controlled  by  1st  April\r\n\r\n2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 decision to abolish rent control was not a\r\n\r\nsudden decision.  In 1988, the Government used the Controlled\r\n\r\nPremises  (Special Provisions) Act, which was  introduced  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the redevelopment of the Golden Shoe area  in  the\r\n\r\n1970s,  to  accelerate the phasing out of rent control.   The\r\n\r\nControlled  Premises  (Special  Provisions)  Act   was   made\r\n\r\napplicable  to  all  rent-controlled  properties  over   four\r\n\r\nphases, between October 1988 and December 1991.  This allowed\r\n\r\nlandlords  to  recover  possession of  their  rent-controlled\r\n\r\nproperties for purposes of development subject to payment of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompensation  to  their  tenants.   As  a  result  of   these\r\n\r\nmeasures,  the  number of rent-controlled properties  dropped\r\n\r\nfrom about 7,600 in 1989 to about 1,600 in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenants have been informed of the impending abolition of\r\n\r\nrent  control.   The Urban Redevelopment Authority  has  been\r\n\r\nsending reminders about the abolition of rent control to  the\r\n\r\ntenants  every year since April 1997.  From April 2000,  that\r\n\r\nis,  last  year,  URA has been sending these reminders  every\r\n\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government's announcement in 1997, the number\r\n\r\nof   rent-controlled   premises  has  shrunk   further   from\r\n\r\napproximately 1,600 to about 700 as at January this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Residential tenants</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are approximately 750 residential tenants (and\r\n\r\ntheir  families)  still  living in rent-controlled  premises.\r\n\r\nThese  tenants can apply for public housing under the various\r\n\r\npublic  housing schemes.  There are also two special  housing\r\n\r\nschemes for people affected by rent decontrol.  Under the Old\r\n\r\nSingle Person Tenants' Scheme, the landlord can apply to  HDB\r\n\r\nto  resettle  two  or more single elderly tenants  in  a  HDB\r\n\r\nrental  flat.   The  landlord will have to  pay  four  years'\r\n\r\nrental to HDB on behalf of his tenants.  The second scheme is\r\n\r\nthe  Rent  Decontrol Housing Assistance Scheme  which  grants\r\n\r\npriority  allocation  of  HDB rental  or  purchase  flats  to\r\n\r\nfamilies or joint singles of more than 35 years old  who  are\r\n\r\naffected by rent decontrol.  These two schemes help to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  affected  residential tenants  will  not  suffer  undue\r\n\r\nhardship.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Non-residential tenants</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 420 non-residential tenants will be affected by\r\n\r\nrent  decontrol.  Of these, some 68% (284) operate businesses\r\n\r\nsuch  as  coffee shops and eating places, medical  halls  and\r\n\r\nretail  and wholesale shops selling a range of goods such  as\r\n\r\njewellery,   stationery,  textiles,   garments,   shoes   and\r\n\r\nelectrical  goods.   Another 10% (41) deal  with  trades  and\r\n\r\ncrafts such as laundry,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhairdressing, photo studios, pawnshops and furniture  making.\r\n\r\nThe  remaining 22% (95) comprise a mix of uses such as  bars,\r\n\r\nlodging  houses, stores as well as bicycle, motor and battery\r\n\r\nworkshops.  These shops and commercial tenants will  have  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate with their landlords to remain after 1st  April  or\r\n\r\nlook for alternative premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention of rent control was to ensure a\r\n\r\nroof  over people's heads during the post-war days of housing\r\n\r\nshortage.   It  was not meant to provide cheap  premises  for\r\n\r\ncommercial or other non-residential uses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go through the main provisions of the Bill\r\n\r\nand give details on the related transitional matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Control of Rent Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Control of Rent Act will be repealed. This\r\n\r\neffectively abolishes rent control in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the repeal of the Control of Rent Act, there will\r\n\r\nno  longer  be any statutory restrictions on the  landowner's\r\n\r\nright  to  adjust  rent  or to recover  possession  of  their\r\n\r\nproperties through the proper legal process.  The  repeal  of\r\n\r\nthe   Control  of  Rent  Act  will  also  dissolve  the  Rent\r\n\r\nConciliation Board, established under that Act to  deal  with\r\n\r\napplications  by  landlords  to  adjust  the  rent  of  rent-controlled  properties.  This is provided for in clause  2(1)\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the major transitional issues\r\n\r\nrelated  to the repeal of the Control of Rent Act, which  are\r\n\r\nset out in the First Schedule of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the repeal of the Control of Rent Act allows\r\n\r\nlandlords  to  adjust  the rent or to recover  possession  of\r\n\r\ntheir   properties   through  the   normal   legal   process.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  with  effect  from 1st April  2001,  any  pending\r\n\r\napplication  with  the  Rental  Conciliation  Board  will  be\r\n\r\ndiscontinued.  Similarly, any proceeding before the courts in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  the  Control of Rent Act will be  discontinued.\r\n\r\nThese  are  provided  in paragraphs  3  to  5  of  the  First\r\n\r\nSchedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the status of a statutory tenant after the\r\n\r\nabolition of rent control is clarified in paragraph 6 of  the\r\n\r\nFirst Schedule.  A former statutory tenant will, on 1st April\r\n\r\n2001,  continue  to hold the premises on the same  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions as before the repeal of the Control of  Rent  Act.\r\n\r\nHowever, either the landlord or the tenant can terminate this\r\n\r\ntenancy  by  giving  the same notice as required  by  law  to\r\n\r\nterminate a monthly tenancy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill deal with the Controlled\r\n\r\nPremises (Special Provisions) Act.  This Act provides a  form\r\n\r\nof  rent  decontrol whereby a landowner is allowed to recover\r\n\r\nhis rent-controlled property for purposes of redevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A landowner who wants to recover his property for\r\n\r\nredevelopment  may  apply to the Tenants' Compensation  Board\r\n\r\n(TCB)  to recover his rent-controlled property.  The TCB  has\r\n\r\nthe   power  to  award  compensation  to  the  tenant.   This\r\n\r\ncompensation is determined based on the provisions of the Act\r\n\r\nand  is  paid by the landowner.  With the abolition  of  rent\r\n\r\ncontrol,  a  landlord no longer needs a TCB order to  recover\r\n\r\nhis property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act will, however, not be repealed immediately so as\r\n\r\nto  allow the TCB to settle its outstanding matters.  The TCB\r\n\r\nwill therefore continue to deal with pending applications for\r\n\r\nwhich the Order for recovery of rent-controlled property  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  prior  to 1st April 2001 and  to  administer  the\r\n\r\npayment of compensation money to tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act will,\r\n\r\nhowever,  be amended as of 1st April 2001.  This is  provided\r\n\r\nin  clause  3 of the Bill.  From that day, the TCB  will  not\r\n\r\naccept any new application for recovery of possession of rent-controlled property, and any pending application for which an\r\n\r\nOrder  for recovery of possession has not been made  will  be\r\n\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are set out in paragraph 1(c) of the\r\n\r\nSecond  Schedule  of  the Bill.  A landowner  who  wishes  to\r\n\r\nrecover possession of his property will thus have to use  the\r\n\r\nnormal legal process from 1st April 2001 onwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act\r\n\r\ncurrently  imposes restrictions on landowners on the  use  of\r\n\r\nproperties  recovered under the Act.  Firstly, a landlord  is\r\n\r\nnot  allowed to use the property for any other purpose except\r\n\r\nfor  redevelopment; he is not allowed to sell  or  lease  the\r\n\r\nproperty  until  redevelopment has  commenced.   Secondly,  a\r\n\r\nlandlord  must commence redevelopment of the property  within\r\n\r\nsix  months  after  repossessing it  and  must  complete  the\r\n\r\nredevelopment within 10 years.   The Act will be  amended  to\r\n\r\nlift  these  restrictions.  The amendments  are  provided  in\r\n\r\nparagraph 1(a) and paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lifting of these restrictions will put such rent-controlled properties on the same footing as any other rent-controlled property that is de-controlled by the repeal of\r\n\r\nthe  Control of Rent Act.  This is in line with the  idea  of\r\n\r\nthe  total  abolition of rent control and  ensures  that  all\r\n\r\nformerly   rent-controlled  properties  are   given   similar\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the repeal of the\r\n\r\nControlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act.  The repeal  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act and the consequent dissolution of the TCB will  take\r\n\r\neffect  after  the  TCB has settled all outstanding  matters.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  clause 4 of the Bill will come into effect  at  a\r\n\r\nlater  date  to  be determined by the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the TCB is finally dissolved, there may still be\r\n\r\ncompensation  moneys  deposited by landowners  with  the  TCB\r\n\r\nwhich  have  not  been  claimed by  the  tenants.   The  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  that  any  unclaimed compensation  moneys  will  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the Urban Redevelopment Authority.   Thus,  a\r\n\r\nclaimant  may continue to claim compensation money after  the\r\n\r\nTCB is dissolved.  The URA will administer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  compensation moneys for a period of 12 months.  This  is\r\n\r\nprovided in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Third Schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 12-month period, any unclaimed compensation\r\n\r\nmoneys  will  be transferred to the Consolidated  Fund.   Any\r\n\r\nclaims  for  compensation moneys may  be  made  to  a  public\r\n\r\nofficer  or  a  statutory authority to be designated  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  If the claim is established, the compensation will\r\n\r\nbe  paid to the claimant from the Consolidated Fund.  This is\r\n\r\nprovided in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Third Schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Premiums on Leases Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also seeks to repeal the Premiums on\r\n\r\nLeases Act.  In recent years, the only effect of this Act has\r\n\r\nbeen  to  deter landlords of rent-controlled properties  from\r\n\r\nseeking higher rents than those prescribed by the Control  of\r\n\r\nRent  Act.  With the appeal of the Control of Rent  Act,  the\r\n\r\nPremiums on Leases Act will no longer be required.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, this Bill will abolish rent control in\r\n\r\nSingapore and make provisions to wind down the affairs of the\r\n\r\nRent Conciliation Board and the Tenants' Compensation Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abolition of the Control of Rent Act is a step\r\n\r\ntowards  an open market economy.  The Act, which was  enacted\r\n\r\nin  the  early  1950s, has outlived its usefulness.   It  was\r\n\r\nmeant  to  prevent unscrupulous landlords of  premises  built\r\n\r\nbefore    7th    September   1947   from   increasing    rent\r\n\r\nindiscriminately.  While it had served its purpose,  the  Act\r\n\r\nis  no  longer  applicable  in  today's  market  environment.\r\n\r\nTenants  now are more educated, and they know how to  protect\r\n\r\ntheir rights against unscrupulous landlords.  The success  of\r\n\r\nthe HDB public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousing has also eliminated the need to protect tenants  from\r\n\r\nbeing levied market rental for these premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some tenants in these rent controlled premises\r\n\r\nhave  abused  the  Act.   I learn that  some  tenants  profit\r\n\r\nimmensely  through the subletting of the  whole  or  part  of\r\n\r\nthese  premises at market rent while paying low rental  under\r\n\r\nthe  Act.   In cases where the premises are of commercial  or\r\n\r\nindustrial  uses,  the profits made are  substantial.   These\r\n\r\npractices  are  unfair  to  landlords  who  have  lost   much\r\n\r\nopportunity to recoup their investment returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above situation has also hindered our urban renewal\r\n\r\nprogress.  With such low rentals, landlords have no incentive\r\n\r\nto  maintain  or  upgrade  their premises,  thus  leading  to\r\n\r\ndisrepair. These derelict premises mar our city landscape and\r\n\r\nresult in under-utilisation of our limited land.  In order to\r\n\r\ninject  life into our city areas, the Government must  remove\r\n\r\nlegislation which hinder urban renewal.  The abolition of the\r\n\r\nAct  will  provide much impetus for landlords  to  rejuvenate\r\n\r\ntheir premises thus adding more buzz to our city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the plight of tenants affected by the\r\n\r\nabolition of the Act.  But we have no choice as market forces\r\n\r\ndetermine  our efforts to prepare Singapore for a  knowledge-based  economy.  We must continue to improve our  living  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  environment to make Singapore a  world-class  city.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, we will spare no effort to make sure  that\r\n\r\nall Singaporeans are taken care of during this transition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to commend the efforts put in by the\r\n\r\nMinistry in helping tenants affected by the abolition of  the\r\n\r\nAct.   The Ministry has announced in April 1997 (three  years\r\n\r\nago)  that the Control of Rent Act will be repealed  as  from\r\n\r\n1st April 2001.  This has given tenants adequate time to make\r\n\r\nthe necessary preparations and adjustments.  In addition, URA\r\n\r\nand  HDB have implemented two housing schemes, especially for\r\n\r\nlow  income  and single aged tenants, who may face difficulty\r\n\r\nfinding alternate accommodation.  They are the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHousing  Assistance Scheme for families affected by rent  de-control  and the scheme for relocating tenants and  occupiers\r\n\r\nwho are single aged persons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these measures clearly show that the Government has\r\n\r\ntaken  a  very  compassionate approach to help  the  affected\r\n\r\ntenants  although it is a private matter.  Likewise,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the landlords will also help low income tenants to make\r\n\r\nthis transition in their lives more smoothly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, a number of media reports have\r\n\r\nfocused  on  the  effects  of the intention  to  remove  rent\r\n\r\ncontrol  on  some  tenants, especially those  with  vanishing\r\n\r\ntrades.  Conservation of buildings and of traditional  trades\r\n\r\nis  a  concern.  A recent survey has shown that while we have\r\n\r\nbeen relatively successful at saving the buildings, there are\r\n\r\ngaps in trying to make sure that traditional trades continue.\r\n\r\nLike many Singaporeans, we were disturbed.  But when we think\r\n\r\nabout  it  more carefully, there are reasons to see that  the\r\n\r\nControl  of Rent Act has been a bit of an anomaly  for  which\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  time  has  passed.   Because  even  if  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned about the conservation of buildings and traditional\r\n\r\ntrades,  we must be fair.  We must recognise that  there  are\r\n\r\nalso  rights  of the owners and that we must actually  create\r\n\r\nincentives for the owners to value the properties, to perhaps\r\n\r\nrestore  the  properties and we can only do so if  they  know\r\n\r\nthat they will get some fair return.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, though I am for conservation, I am not for\r\n\r\nthe  freezing of time, like a magic wand, where the  sleeping\r\n\r\nbeauty  is supposed to keep sleeping for 100 years.   Rather,\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of  approach  of freezing things,  making  people\r\n\r\nsleep, will tend to lead to distortion of markets, and  I  do\r\n\r\nshare  Dr  Teo Ho Pin's point on the problem about subletting\r\n\r\nand  profiteering by some tenants.  In a sense,  Sir,  I  was\r\n\r\nassured  to hear that there will be special schemes for  some\r\n\r\nof the tenants who are affected, the elderly tenants who have\r\n\r\nlittle  choice.  More than that, more generally, I would  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  phasing-in over a long transition period  of  four\r\n\r\nyears shows that while Government sees that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomething needs to be done, they have sent a signal to  those\r\n\r\ntenants  to  please do something to accommodate the  changing\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For businesses, I believe we cannot save them by special\r\n\r\nprivilege, by freezing them in time.  We can at best  prevent\r\n\r\nsudden  changes, unexpected upheavals.  But in  the  end,  we\r\n\r\nshould  foster  them  to change over time  to  meet  changing\r\n\r\ntimes.  This, of course, is not easy for businesses.  That is\r\n\r\nwhy  there is such a thing called the free market.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  traditional businesses will go out of  business.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  you  look around us, sometimes there are stories  which\r\n\r\nheartened us, for example, the Killiney Road Kopi Tiam.   The\r\n\r\nfact  that they have continued, the fact that they  have  got\r\n\r\nbranches,  shows  them competing in a sense with  the  coffee\r\n\r\nclubs  of today.  And those were the things those of  us  who\r\n\r\nare  conservationists, but yet who want  to  see  a  bubbling\r\n\r\nvibrant modern Singapore, have to think about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point, Sir, that continues to have some\r\n\r\ndifficulty for me.  It only occurred to me when the  Minister\r\n\r\nwas  reading  the  Bill.  This is part of the  Schedule  that\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the discontinuance of proceedings  before  the\r\n\r\ncourts and tribunals.  These courts and tribunals are already\r\n\r\nseized of the matter.  They are hearing the issues.  We  seem\r\n\r\nto  be actually pre-empting their decision.  In comparison to\r\n\r\nthat, if I am correct, the Minister has said that the Tenants\r\n\r\nCompensation Board will have a right to continue to look over\r\n\r\nthe  issues already before them.  Could I understand from the\r\n\r\nMinister  why  is  the difference and whether  we  should  be\r\n\r\ndiscontinuing these proceedings?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill because conservation is not\r\n\r\nabout  freezing areas or people in time but encouraging  them\r\n\r\nto move forward at a pace acceptable to all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I welcome this\r\n\r\nControl  of  Rent  (Abolition) Bill.  It is timely  now  that\r\n\r\nSingapore has, more or less, solved the problem of housing in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But the Control of Rent Act, at the time when  it\r\n\r\nwas enacted,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas a good law.  It was a socialist piece of legislation.  It\r\n\r\nprotected  the  poor tenants from the landlords  because,  at\r\n\r\nthat particular point of time, there was an acute shortage of\r\n\r\nhousing,  and if there were no such law to protect them,  the\r\n\r\nrents  would have shot sky-high and they would all have  been\r\n\r\nforced out and to live in the streets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got only two issues. One is whether or not\r\n\r\nthat  will cause hardship to certain people in Singapore.   I\r\n\r\nknow that the Minister had already said that the Ministry  is\r\n\r\nhaving some kind of a scheme to help people who have to  move\r\n\r\nout  from their rent controlled premises.  They will have  to\r\n\r\nmove out once this abolition of the Act comes into effect  on\r\n\r\n1st  April.   I  have  no doubt that the  landlords  of  rent\r\n\r\ncontrolled premises will increase their rents.  They will not\r\n\r\nonly increase their rents, but increase them higher than what\r\n\r\nthey should be, because they feel that they are justified  to\r\n\r\ndo  so  to  recoup their losses for so many  years  when  the\r\n\r\nrentals  were  lost in a certain way in that they  could  not\r\n\r\nincrease their rentals as early as 1953.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members, I am sure, are familiar with the rentals\r\n\r\nthat  the  landlords  are getting for their  rent  controlled\r\n\r\npremises.  Some tenants are only paying something like $40 or\r\n\r\n$50 for a two-storey terrace house because for so many years,\r\n\r\nthe landlords have been collecting such low rentals.  Most of\r\n\r\nthese houses are quite run down, until of course they receive\r\n\r\na  notice  from  the HDB to spruce up their buildings.   Even\r\n\r\nwhen  they have to spend money repainting and repairing their\r\n\r\npremises, they will lose much money because they have to take\r\n\r\nmoney  out of their own pocket to pay first, which the meagre\r\n\r\nrents they have received all those years cannot make up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am thinking of the plight of single persons who\r\n\r\nare  not within the scope of help which the Ministry is going\r\n\r\nto  give.  In fact, last night, in my meet-the-people session\r\n\r\nI  saw  for  the first time such hardship cases.  A  man,  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of his friend who is a 80-year old widow, came to  see\r\n\r\nme.  The landlord must have known\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  abolition of the Control of Rent Act and has already\r\n\r\ngot a lawyer to send this old lady a notice to quit within  a\r\n\r\nweek  from 1st April if she cannot pay the new rental,  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  increased from $280, which she is presently paying,\r\n\r\nto  $1,800.  So you can see landlords of controlled  premises\r\n\r\nare  quick to take advantage of the abolition of the old law.\r\n\r\nThe  increase  is  slightly over seven times.   The  premises\r\n\r\nwhere  the old lady lives is in my constituency which  is  an\r\n\r\nold building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there must have been other similar cases throughout\r\n\r\nthe  island.  The Minister mentioned about 1,000-odd of these\r\n\r\npremises.   I know HDB is doing everything they can  to  help\r\n\r\nthese tenants.  But I hope, somehow or rather, HDB rules  can\r\n\r\nbe amended to help accommodate single people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to bring up has been mentioned by\r\n\r\nMr   Simon  Tay.   This  concerns  the  preservation  of  old\r\n\r\nbuildings.  Sir, once the Bill comes into effect, I  am  sure\r\n\r\nlandlords will immediately get rid of their tenants and  sell\r\n\r\nthe  buildings to the developers who will probably pull  them\r\n\r\ndown.  Or the owners themselves will pull the buildings  down\r\n\r\nand   redevelop  the  land.   If  these  old  buildings   are\r\n\r\ndemolished, Singapore will be a different place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Budget session, we have been debating on\r\n\r\nwhat  it is to be a Singaporean.  If all these buildings were\r\n\r\nknocked  down, many of us older Singaporeans would have  lost\r\n\r\nsomething.  The old buildings are very familiar to the  older\r\n\r\ngeneration and that is how they feel that they have a home in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If the familiar buildings are gone and, in  their\r\n\r\nplaces, strange looking buildings are put up, Singapore would\r\n\r\nbe  a  strange  place to them.  It is no different  from  any\r\n\r\nother city in the world.  So Singapore becomes another place.\r\n\r\nIt  is no longer the home in which they are so familiar with.\r\n\r\nI  would  earnestly  urge the Government  to  take  steps  to\r\n\r\nprevent   the   wholesale  demolition  of  the  old   pre-war\r\n\r\nbuildings.  Greed is a great motivating factor, and  we  know\r\n\r\nwhat  developers  and house owners of old buildings  will  do\r\n\r\nwhen the next rise in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperty  prices  comes  along, unless  of  course  they  are\r\n\r\ncurbed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all the\r\n\r\nMembers who have risen to speak.  I believe all of them  have\r\n\r\nsupported the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Teo rightly pointed out, rent control has outlived\r\n\r\nits  usefulness.   It  was enacted at  a  time  when  it  was\r\n\r\nabsolutely  necessary.  As Mr Chiam pointed out, I  think  it\r\n\r\nwas  a  very noble piece of legislation, and it has  actually\r\n\r\nenabled  a  lot of the people who came to Singapore  at  that\r\n\r\ntime,  just  after the war, to be able to have a decent  roof\r\n\r\nover  their  heads.  But, over 50 years have  passed,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink we all agree now that there is really no necessity  for\r\n\r\nsuch an Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question really is whether we allow sufficient\r\n\r\ntime,  for  those  tenants who have  been  affected  by  rent\r\n\r\ndecontrol,  to  adjust.  I believe the Government  has  given\r\n\r\nmore  than  sufficient time for the tenants  to  adjust.   In\r\n\r\ntrying  to be fair to the tenants, we also have to take  into\r\n\r\naccount the interests of the landlord, but I believe that  we\r\n\r\nhave  given  sufficient time for both parties to come  to  an\r\n\r\namicable settlement.  In fact, it is not just four years  ago\r\n\r\nthat  notice  was given. The intention of the  Government  to\r\n\r\nabolish rent control was signalled as far back as 1988,  when\r\n\r\nthe Control of Premises Act was used to start the first phase\r\n\r\nof  rent  decontrol.  Since then, in 1997,  four  years  ago,\r\n\r\nactual  notice  was given, annual notices were  sent  to  the\r\n\r\noccupiers  in  all the four official languages.   Last  year,\r\n\r\nevery  three  months, the same notice was  sent  out.   So  I\r\n\r\nbelieve adequate attention has been paid, and adequate notice\r\n\r\nhas been given, to everybody concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, of course, there have been several\r\n\r\nadditional  steps being taken to make sure that  tenants  who\r\n\r\nare  affected  adversely by rent decontrol would  not  suffer\r\n\r\nunduly.   These are the several schemes that I have mentioned\r\n\r\njust now to help the tenants.  One was the Old Single Persons\r\n\r\nScheme,   and  the  other  is  the  Rent  Decontrol   Housing\r\n\r\nAssistance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScheme.   So  steps  have been taken to make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\neffects of rent decontrol are mitigated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an anomaly, as Mr Simon Tay has said, and he has\r\n\r\nalso rightly pointed out that we should not just look at  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the tenants, but we should also  look  at  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  the  owners.  In this respect, we have  tried  to\r\n\r\nbalance both as much as we can.  And the rights of the owners\r\n\r\nare  necessary  -  not  only  the right  to  recognise  their\r\n\r\nproperty  rights, but also to incentivise them, to give  them\r\n\r\nan incentive to refurbish and to renovate their premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, perhaps I should reassure Mr Chiam that\r\n\r\nit does not mean that all premises that are rent decontrolled\r\n\r\nwill  necessarily be demolished, redeveloped or knocked down.\r\n\r\nSome of those premises are gazetted for conservation and,  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  so gazetted, they will not be allowed to  be  torn\r\n\r\ndown.   The questions of conservation and rent decontrol  are\r\n\r\ntwo   separate  matters.   So  where  they  are   worthy   of\r\n\r\nconservation,  separate steps would be taken to  incentivise,\r\n\r\nas well as to prevent, in some cases, developers from tearing\r\n\r\nthem down.  That much he can be assured of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for traditional businesses or so-called vanishing\r\n\r\ntrades,  again it is a question of how we can make sure  that\r\n\r\nthese vanishing trades do not vanish.  If there is a need for\r\n\r\nsuch trades, they will not vanish.  In fact, he has mentioned\r\n\r\nseveral of them, eg, the Killiney Road Kopi Tiam.  And  there\r\n\r\nare  some other traditional trades which are doing very  well\r\n\r\nin Chinatown, eg, medicine shops, herb dealers, the very well-known  kaya toast shop which has now moved to Far East Square\r\n\r\nand,  I am sure, there are many other examples.  So the moral\r\n\r\nof  the story is, if it serves a purpose, if there is demand,\r\n\r\nif  there is somebody willing to carry on the trade and it is\r\n\r\nworthwhile  for them to carry on the trade, that  trade  will\r\n\r\nnot  vanish.   It is as simple as that.  It is  not  easy  to\r\n\r\nsubsidise them to make sure that they carry on.  And,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon Tay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrightly  points out, we cannot freeze everything in time.   I\r\n\r\nknow  some countries and some cities do that.  They have  got\r\n\r\ncertain  areas  set aside where they carry  on  some  of  the\r\n\r\ntrades  of old, eg, shoeing horses, making nails and  so  on.\r\n\r\nBut  those  are for the tourists.  They are not real  trades.\r\n\r\nThey are actually there for the sake of, maybe, preserving  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit of the past for the enjoyment of tourists.   So  I\r\n\r\nthink we are talking about different things.  But, certainly,\r\n\r\nfor those trades which can survive, I think they will survive\r\n\r\neven after rent decontrol, because there is a demand for such\r\n\r\ntrades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also made a specific point about the\r\n\r\ndiscontinuance  of proceedings.  I think he is  referring  to\r\n\r\nthe Control of Premises (Special Provisions) Act which we are\r\n\r\namending.  Under this amendment, what we are doing is to  say\r\n\r\nthat TCB will not accept any new applications for recovery of\r\n\r\npossession.   All  those applications that  are  pending  and\r\n\r\nwhich  Order  for  Recovery of Possession has  not  yet  been\r\n\r\nissued,  those will be discontinued.  But anything  that  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  settled, that is of course  with  the  Tenants\r\n\r\nCompensation  Board.  If the monies have  not  been  claimed,\r\n\r\nthose monies will be set aside and, therefore, they will  not\r\n\r\nbe  touched.  I believe that is what he is referring to.   Is\r\n\r\nthat correct, Mr Simon Tay?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just clarify\r\n\r\nbriefly?   That is correct, Sir.  But, on the other hand,  if\r\n\r\nyou  look at the First Schedule, the savings and transitional\r\n\r\nprovisions on the repeal of the Control of Rent Act,  clauses\r\n\r\n3 and 4 provide for the discontinuance of proceedings for the\r\n\r\nRent  Conciliation  Board,  and for  the  discontinuation  of\r\n\r\ncertain proceedings for the High Court.  Sir, perhaps  I  can\r\n\r\nraise this issue separately with the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> A final issue I would like to address\r\n\r\nis Mr Chiam's point whether there will be hardship to certain\r\n\r\npeople caused by the Act.  I think, yes, some people will  be\r\n\r\nadversely  affected  by  this.  He cited  the  example  of  a\r\n\r\nconstituent of his, a widow who is 80 years.  If that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson  is not eligible for assistance under the two  schemes\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  mentioned earlier, there are  the  normal  HDB\r\n\r\nschemes where she can get assistance and, if not, if he would\r\n\r\nlike to put up a case, we will consider that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CHILDREN DEVELOPMENT CO-SAVINGS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>5.38 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) required to replace\r\n\r\nourselves is 2.1.  But the last time we achieved this was  in\r\n\r\n1976.   When major measures encouraging couples to have  more\r\n\r\nchildren  were introduced in 1987, the TFR rose  to  1.96  in\r\n\r\n1988.   But our TFR has been on a downward trend since  then.\r\n\r\nThe  preliminary TFR for last year did rise from 1.48 in 1999\r\n\r\nto  1.59,  but  this is still low, despite the year  being  a\r\n\r\nDragon year and our coming out of the recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no laughing matter. Singapore is already one of\r\n\r\nthe  fastest  ageing societies in the world.  If  we  do  not\r\n\r\narrest  this alarming trend, it will have severe implications\r\n\r\non  our survival as a nation.  The family, as the first  line\r\n\r\nof support, would come under severe pressure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August last year, the Prime Minister announced that\r\n\r\nthe  Government would implement the Children Development  Co-Savings  Scheme, or more popularly known as \"Baby Bonus\"  for\r\n\r\nshort,  as  well  as  the Third Child  Paid  Maternity  Leave\r\n\r\nbenefit  from 1st April this year.  Sir, this is one  of  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  which we hope can help arrest the trend I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"Baby Bonus\" is a two-tiered scheme. In the first\r\n\r\ntier,  the  Government would provide $500 per  year  for  the\r\n\r\nsecond  child,  and $1,000 per year for the third  child,  as\r\n\r\ndirect  cash  grants  for  those born  from  1st  April  2001\r\n\r\nonwards.   Parents can use these grants to help meet  any  of\r\n\r\nthe  child's  needs,  including informal  care  arrangements,\r\n\r\nfood, clothing, developmental needs and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tier is an annual co-payment scheme. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  match  parents'  contribution  dollar-for-dollar up to $1,000 per year for the second child, and up  to\r\n\r\n$2,000  per  year for the third.  Contributions from  parents\r\n\r\nand  Government  would  be  placed in  the  child's  Children\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Account, similar to a Trust-Minor  account  that\r\n\r\ncan  be opened for a child in any bank.  Parents can only use\r\n\r\nthese funds for their children's childcare, kindergarten  and\r\n\r\nnursery  fees.  However, the funds can be used to  meet  such\r\n\r\nneeds for any of the children that the couple may have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both tiers of the grant would be given for six years,\r\n\r\nand  we  hope  these  measures  would  address  some  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  constraints that many people say  they  face  when\r\n\r\nthey  decide  whether to have a second or third  child.   The\r\n\r\n\"Baby   Bonus\"   is  to  help  parents  meet  the   financial\r\n\r\ncommitments  they  have  towards their children's  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation  and  other child development programmes.    But  I\r\n\r\nmust  emphasise, Sir, that the \"Baby Bonus\" is not  meant  to\r\n\r\ndefray the entire financial cost of child-rearing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third child paid maternity leave for both employed\r\n\r\nand self-employed mothers would allow working mothers to take\r\n\r\nup  to  8 weeks of paid leave to be with their newborn  third\r\n\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that the Government recognises\r\n\r\nthat family formation is a personal decision and life choice.\r\n\r\nThe  measures proposed in the Bill are for those who want  to\r\n\r\nhave  children,  but anticipate financial or other  practical\r\n\r\nobstacles that would deter them from doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, hence, provides for the introduction of\r\n\r\na Children Development Co-Savings Scheme to assist parents in\r\n\r\nthe  development  of their children. Clause  3  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides for regulations to be made for the establishment and\r\n\r\nadministration of the \"Baby Bonus\".  This would enable us  to\r\n\r\nfine-tune  the Scheme and the required legislative  framework\r\n\r\nas we progress, since the Scheme has no precedence here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for the substitution of the trustee of\r\n\r\nthe  Children Development Account should the trustee need  to\r\n\r\nbe  changed.  This could occur if the trustee dies, is unable\r\n\r\nto  act because of unsoundness of mind, or loses the custody,\r\n\r\ncare  or  control  of the child, say, in  a  divorce,  or  in\r\n\r\ninstances of child abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 would protect the money paid into the Children\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Account by the Government, or the parents,  from\r\n\r\nbeing  considered \"matrimonial assets\" for  division  to  the\r\n\r\nparents if they divorce, or being claimed by creditors should\r\n\r\none of the parents be declared a bankrupt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a moral duty to ensure that the \"Baby\r\n\r\nBonus\" is spent appropriately.  We would, therefore, restrict\r\n\r\nusage of the funds in the Children Development Account to the\r\n\r\napproved  centres  as provided for in clause  7.   The  funds\r\n\r\nmight  be  used  at  centres that opt to participate  in  the\r\n\r\nScheme.   For  a  start,  childcare centres  licensed  by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry,  kindergartens and nurseries  registered  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education, and pre-school programmes at  schools\r\n\r\nfor   children  with  special  needs  would  be  invited   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in this Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect the interests of the child, and the monies in\r\n\r\nhis  or  her Account, clause 18 would make it an offence  for\r\n\r\nany person or organisation from touting itself as an approved\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any funds left in the Account when the child reaches\r\n\r\nschool-going age would be transferred to the child's  Edusave\r\n\r\naccount.   Clause  22  would  facilitate  this  transfer   by\r\n\r\nproviding for a consequential amendment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto section 7 of the Education Endowment Scheme Act, to enable\r\n\r\nany  monies  to  be  transferred from  the  child's  Children\r\n\r\nDevelopment Account to the Edusave Pupils Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 9 would provide paid maternity leave benefit\r\n\r\nof  up  to eight weeks for women who have their third  child,\r\n\r\nsimilar to that provided for the first and second child under\r\n\r\nthe Employment Act.   But unlike the paid maternity leave for\r\n\r\nthe  first two children under that Act, the cost of the  paid\r\n\r\nmaternity leave benefit for the third child would be borne by\r\n\r\nthe Government, so as not to increase the cost of business to\r\n\r\nemployers.  Furthermore, it would be extended to all  working\r\n\r\nmothers,   beyond  those  covered  in  the  Employment   Act,\r\n\r\nincluding  executives  and  the self-employed.   The  maximum\r\n\r\namount that could be claimed would be $20,000, including  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions, and would be pro-rated if the woman takes less\r\n\r\nthan  eight  weeks  of leave.  Only married  women  would  be\r\n\r\neligible  for this benefit, so as to be consistent  with  our\r\n\r\nvalues   to  promote  births  within  intact  families.    In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  child should be a Singaporean  by  birth,  as\r\n\r\nultimately,  we are interested in boosting our citizen  birth\r\n\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This benefit would apply to women who will be on\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave for their third child on or after 1st  April\r\n\r\n2001.  Hence, if a woman has been granted maternity leave  of\r\n\r\neight weeks prior to 1st April 2001, she would be compensated\r\n\r\nfor  those days that have not been completely consumed by 1st\r\n\r\nApril 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like for the paid maternity leave for the first and\r\n\r\nsecond  child,  employers would pay their employees  eligible\r\n\r\nfor  the  third child paid maternity leave. They  would  then\r\n\r\nseek reimbursement from the Government, as provided for under\r\n\r\nclause  10,  subject to a cap of $20,000.  This would  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there is no break in salaries to women who make use  of\r\n\r\nthis benefit, and it would also involve employers as integral\r\n\r\npartners in this family-friendly measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the \"Baby Bonus\" is estimated to cost about $225\r\n\r\nmillion  in  the  steady  state, and  the  third  child  paid\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave benefit, about $13.5 million annually.   The\r\n\r\nfigures  could  go up if there are more higher order  births.\r\n\r\nAdequate  provisions as in clauses 8 and 11 are provided  for\r\n\r\nto ensure that these funds would not be abused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 would make it an offence for any person to\r\n\r\nmake  any  false  or misleading statement or  to  produce  or\r\n\r\nfurnish any false or misleading document for the purposes  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.  The penalty for such an offence would be a  fine\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding  $20,000,  or imprisonment  not  exceeding  12\r\n\r\nmonths, or both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clause 17 would make it an offence for an\r\n\r\nemployer not to pay his employee if she is eligible  for  the\r\n\r\nthird  child  paid  maternity  leave  benefit.   Such  errant\r\n\r\nemployers   would  face  a  fine  not  exceeding  $1,000   or\r\n\r\nimprisonment  not  exceeding six months or  both,  consistent\r\n\r\nwith  the penalty provided for in the Employment Act  for  an\r\n\r\nemployer who fails to pay his employee her maternity benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid litigation for every alleged offence, clause 14\r\n\r\nwould  provide  for resolution of disputes, while  clause  19\r\n\r\nwould  provide  for composition of offences  for  a  sum  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $500 for employers who fail to pay their employees\r\n\r\nthe  third child maternity leave benefit, and $5,000 for  all\r\n\r\nother offences under the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taken by themselves, we do not realistically expect\r\n\r\nthem  to restore the TFR to the replacement level, but  taken\r\n\r\ntogether   with  the  other  measures  announced  thus   far,\r\n\r\nsustained  public  education  on  the  importance  of  family\r\n\r\nformation,  and impending recommendations of the  Ministerial\r\n\r\nand Working Committees on Marriage and Procreation, they have\r\n\r\na  reasonable chance of raising our birth rate.   My Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to look into ways of removing  the  obstacles\r\n\r\ncouples face in having children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, we already have had\r\n\r\neight  days of long debate.  I would be concise and you would\r\n\r\nbe  very  relieved if all other speakers after  me  would  be\r\n\r\nconcise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Good idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I support the Bill as it provides\r\n\r\nfurther  opportunities for the development of  our  children.\r\n\r\nThe  provisions  in  the Bill are very generous  and  we  are\r\n\r\ncommitting  substantial public funds to support  children  in\r\n\r\ntheir  development, and this is an investment  in  our  human\r\n\r\nresources.  It is expected that more than $250 million  would\r\n\r\nbe  spent  in  this area and in future, we expect  that  more\r\n\r\nfunds  would  be  released  if we are  going  to  re-generate\r\n\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I see it, the better-off families will take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the provisions.  I hope steps will be taken  for\r\n\r\nsome  funding top-ups for the less better-off families.  This\r\n\r\nwill  help the less well-off children to benefit as  much  as\r\n\r\npossible.   Would the Minister look into this  issue  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of implementing this Bill?  It would also be  useful\r\n\r\nif  we  monitor  the  profiles  of  families  that  would  be\r\n\r\nparticipating in the Scheme so that the Ministry will be able\r\n\r\nto take corrective actions and other related interventions to\r\n\r\nenable all children to benefit from this Bill itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is intended to strengthen the family and be pro-family. But from the start, on page 1 of the Bill, it is\r\n\r\nconceptualised  to  encourage  married  women  to  have  more\r\n\r\nchildren.  Is this a mistake or an oversight by the  Ministry\r\n\r\nitself?   It  is, I believe, more politically correct  if  it\r\n\r\nshould  be to encourage married couples.  I think that  would\r\n\r\nbe  more appropriate because it takes married couples to have\r\n\r\nchildren in order to regenerate.  This is an important  issue\r\n\r\nand  it  is  essential that we provide the right  perspective\r\n\r\nright from the start.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without married couples, the Bill would not achieve its\r\n\r\nobjectives.   Decisions  on  family  size  are  usually   the\r\n\r\ndecisions  of  couples, not of one partner to  the  marriage.\r\n\r\nAll  the time, we emphasise on marriage as a partnership.  We\r\n\r\nalso accept,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  one  of our core values, the family as a basic unit.   It\r\n\r\nis,  therefore, desirable that the wording, at the  beginning\r\n\r\nof this Bill, should reinforce this value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 13, the Minister will have powers to\r\n\r\nexclude  certain classes of persons.  We hope that  in  using\r\n\r\nthese  powers, the Minister would exercise caution to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  exclusions  do not create further divisiveness  amongst\r\n\r\nfamilies,  but  we will find various means to promote  social\r\n\r\ncohesion.  This is very important, as children have been  our\r\n\r\nresource, and we should not discriminate in the longer  term.\r\n\r\nIt  is  essentially necessary to help us to  make  a  society\r\n\r\nwhich is supportive and more cohesive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to identify some major\r\n\r\nsocial implications of the Bill on families and children, and\r\n\r\nthe steps to be taken to deal with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I stand to speak\r\n\r\nin support of the Children Development Co-Savings Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) currently stands\r\n\r\nat a dismal 1.59, as mentioned by the Minister earlier, which\r\n\r\nis  very much below the replacement rate of 2.1.  In view  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that our country is small, and we have  a  smaller\r\n\r\nbase  in  population  to start with, this  figure  is  indeed\r\n\r\nworrisome.  It is, therefore, timely and welcomed that  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh, in August last year, announced the \"baby bonus\"\r\n\r\nand  third child maternity leave, as well as the set up of  a\r\n\r\nMinisterial Committee to study our declining birth rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government handouts and support have helped ease the\r\n\r\nburden  of raising children in some of the northern  European\r\n\r\ncountries.  Denmark has a total fertility rate of 1.7,  which\r\n\r\nis  relatively higher compared to, say, Italy, with a TFR  of\r\n\r\n1.2.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the level of childcare facilities and parental\r\n\r\nbenefits  seem  to  make  a  significant  difference.    Most\r\n\r\ncountries  on the southern rim of Europe, such as  Italy  and\r\n\r\nSpain, have some of the lowest TFRs on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe continent.  The governments there provide much less child-related  allowances than the Nordic countries that have  some\r\n\r\nof  the  highest fertility rates in Europe, despite the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the proportion of women in their labour force  is  also\r\n\r\namong  the  highest.   In the northern  countries,  childcare\r\n\r\nservices are widely available and are subsidised by up to 85%\r\n\r\nin  some cases.  Financial support is provided in the form of\r\n\r\nbirth  and child allowances, up to the time the child reaches\r\n\r\nadulthood  in  certain cases.  I am confident that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  achieve results, just as good, if not better,  with  the\r\n\r\nright incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the \"baby bonus\" incentives are applicable to\r\n\r\nbabies born from 1st April this year.  May I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Community  Development and Sports whether  his  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  be  flexible in those cases where births are  premature\r\n\r\nwhen  the expected dates of delivery should have been  on  or\r\n\r\nafter  1st April this year?  It must be recognised that there\r\n\r\nare  medical, as well as unpreventable conditions  that  give\r\n\r\nrise  to delivery of babies earlier than the expected  dates.\r\n\r\nSuch premature deliveries are due to unforeseen circumstances\r\n\r\nthrough  no fault of the expectant mothers.  Sir, although  I\r\n\r\nagree  that there is a need for a cut-off date, I  feel  that\r\n\r\nexceptions must be allowed for medically certified  premature\r\n\r\nbirths.   I  hope  MCDS  will  consider  my  stand  in   this\r\n\r\nfavourably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families can use the moneys from the \"baby bonus\" to pay\r\n\r\nfor  the  development and education of their children.   Sir,\r\n\r\ndevelopment of children is indeed important, as not  only  do\r\n\r\nwe  want  more  children, we must ensure  we  get  the  best-developed  children.  For this, we need  to  start  promoting\r\n\r\ngood  parenting skills.  Educators and service providers have\r\n\r\nemphasised on the need for parents to learn parenting  skills\r\n\r\nearly  to  prevent  problems further downstream.   They  have\r\n\r\nobserved  that  parents  of troubled  youths  typically  lack\r\n\r\nparenting  skills  and have other problems such  as  strained\r\n\r\nmarital  relations.   In  light  of  this,  I  propose   that\r\n\r\nequipping  parents  with  good  parenting  skills  should  be\r\n\r\nfacilitated and encouraged and we should allow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  of the \"baby bonus\" moneys to be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nSince clause 3 of the said Bill enables the Minister to  make\r\n\r\nregulations,   and   clause  3(2)(h)  in  particular,   gives\r\n\r\ndiscretion  to  the Minister to determine  the  purposes  for\r\n\r\nwhich  the  money may be used, I would urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider my proposal.  MCDS can always give guidelines as  to\r\n\r\nthe  kind  and the number of courses for parents  that  would\r\n\r\nyield maximum results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said before that studies have shown that\r\n\r\nvery  young children fare better with family-based childcare.\r\n\r\nMCDS  should,  therefore,  encourage family-based  childcare,\r\n\r\nespecially  for infants.  The ideal care-givers  for  infants\r\n\r\nare,  of  course,  the parents themselves.  However,  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  Singapore, immediate family members,  relatives,\r\n\r\nneighbours  and  even friends can be reasonably  good  parent\r\n\r\nsubstitutes.   We may like to encourage or even  entice  such\r\n\r\nsuitable  housewives  and retirees to \"work\"  as  home  care-givers  by allowing them some income whilst staying at  home.\r\n\r\nThus, we should allow use of moneys from \"baby bonus\" to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  childcare  with  registered  and  approved  \"home  care-givers\", instead of conventional nursery or childcare centres\r\n\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reimbursement of third child maternity leave paid to\r\n\r\nemployees,  I  hope  MCDS  ensures  that  the  procedure  for\r\n\r\nclaiming  the benefit is made as convenient as possible.   It\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  hassle free experience, and  there  should  be\r\n\r\nminimal  tedious form filling.  MCDS has spelt out the  claim\r\n\r\nprocedure  for this third child maternity leave, and  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  criteria is that claims must be submitted within a month\r\n\r\nafter  the end of the maternity leave.  Late claims will  not\r\n\r\nbe  accepted by MCDS.  On this aspect, I feel that  the  one-month  claim period is too short.  Perhaps the Minister would\r\n\r\nconsider  having  it  extended to two or  three  months,  and\r\n\r\ngiving more flexibility for later claims with valid reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 11 gives the employer and the Government\r\n\r\nrights  against  an employee where payment  is  made  to  the\r\n\r\nemployee owing to a mistake of fact\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor on reliance of false and misleading statement furnished by\r\n\r\nthe  employee.  However, the Bill does not confer any  rights\r\n\r\non  the  employee in the event the employer fails to pay  the\r\n\r\nemployee.  This should be redressed in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Community Development and Sports\r\n\r\nwill  consider my aforesaid suggestions favourably.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  has referred to the alarming trend in our fertility\r\n\r\nrate.   And  if  the  grand objective  of  this  Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nencourage  women  in  Singapore to have more  children,  then\r\n\r\nshould the Bill not cover all women and all births?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first component in the \"Baby Bonus\" scheme is a\r\n\r\ndirect  cash  payment which applies to all women who  deliver\r\n\r\nthe  second and third child born on or after 1st April  2001.\r\n\r\nSir,  why discriminate against first birth, baby number  four\r\n\r\nand after?  For low-income families, some extra cash during a\r\n\r\nfirst   baby's  birth  is  always  helpful.   If  this  first\r\n\r\nexperience  is unpleasant and burdensome, then young  couples\r\n\r\nwill  not  warm  up to the idea of a second  conception.   In\r\n\r\nshort,  I am suggesting that we give something for the  first\r\n\r\nchild  in  order to promote a positive psychology  towards  a\r\n\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For larger families, the issue of affordability is a\r\n\r\nconcern.  But who is to decide on affordability?  Is that the\r\n\r\nonly  determining criterion for having children?  What  about\r\n\r\nthe  desire  for children factor?  If the family enjoys  four\r\n\r\nvarieties of dishes for a meal, and there are many others who\r\n\r\nenjoy  just  two dishes, maybe some families only  one  dish,\r\n\r\nbecause  they want to save the money so as to have  a  fourth\r\n\r\nchild,  why  do we then not encourage them?  It is important,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  we  signal to all mothers, whether homemakers  or\r\n\r\nworking,  that their maternity role and having  children  are\r\n\r\nworthy  of  State support.  No groups will feel discriminated\r\n\r\nor  left out.  Instead of having one cash amount for all, the\r\n\r\nState could consider designing an earnings related scheme, so\r\n\r\nthat there is not too much of a drain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  national resources.  And for wealthy families who do  not\r\n\r\nneed this money, maybe they could re-donate the money to  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Chest, for needy causes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component of the \"Baby Bonus\" scheme is the\r\n\r\nchildren   development   co-savings   scheme,   whereby   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  co-pays by matching contributions  from  parents.\r\n\r\nHere,  I  again question why do we not extend this  incentive\r\n\r\ncoverage  to include first-borns and the fourth, fifth  child\r\n\r\nand so on.  If parents are willing to save to do this, why do\r\n\r\nwe   not   encourage  them?   For  low-income   families   in\r\n\r\nparticular,  which  may only have one child,  the  co-savings\r\n\r\nscheme will represent a significant social insurance scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next family-friendly initiative is instituting a\r\n\r\nthird child maternity payment for only working married women.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  initiative which we all welcome.   But  if  the\r\n\r\nobjective of the Bill is to encourage more children, then why\r\n\r\nlimit  the  special benefit, again, to only the third  child,\r\n\r\nand  not  the fourth, fifth and so on?  Given the  trends  in\r\n\r\nfertility pattern -  delayed marriages, older ages  on  first\r\n\r\nbirths  and  smaller families  -  incentives,  like  granting\r\n\r\nmaternity benefits to working women for the fourth child  and\r\n\r\nabove,  may  not invite that many takers in the first  place.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a conservative measure being applied so  as\r\n\r\nnot to impose a significant drain on our national resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it not better enhance the fertility trend if we\r\n\r\nbroaden the base to extend these various schemes to all women\r\n\r\nand  for  all  births?   And  what  we  also  achieve  is   a\r\n\r\nconsistency of social policy in upholding our recognition and\r\n\r\nsupport  for  mothers.  Included in this  process  should  be\r\n\r\nappropriate counselling programmes to help couples in  making\r\n\r\nfamily planning decisions according to their ability to cope.\r\n\r\nThis  should  be a role that community agencies can  actively\r\n\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must resolve our contradiction in our\r\n\r\nprocreation  policies.  On the one hand, we want more  babies\r\n\r\nand, on the other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhand, public hospitals charge 150% more (from $400 to $1,000)\r\n\r\nfor  the  fourth  and subsequent births.  I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to clarify his position on this policy decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the Bill, as it is, I would like to raise a number\r\n\r\nof  queries.  First, on the co-savings scheme in Part  II  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the child is the absolute beneficiary of the trust,\r\n\r\nat  what age will the child be freed from parental or trustee\r\n\r\ncontrol   over   this   trust  and  the  regulatory   control\r\n\r\nimplemented by the Government?  The Bill appears to be silent\r\n\r\non stipulating a cut-off age in transferring the trust to the\r\n\r\nyoung adult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be the guiding principles for the use and\r\n\r\napplication of these funds?  Can the parents who  need  money\r\n\r\ndesperately,  say, for example, to pay for  medical  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred  by  a  third child, access this  trust?   Can  they\r\n\r\naccess this fund at all for other purposes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, at the age of 21, the member, now a young adult,\r\n\r\nincurred  gambling or business losses, can he, at this  legal\r\n\r\nage,  use  this trust to pay it off?  If it becomes  a  court\r\n\r\ncase against the member, can the judge demand the seizure  of\r\n\r\nthe trust?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one parent dies before the member is 21 years old,\r\n\r\ncan the trust be transferred to the other parent?  Or if both\r\n\r\nparents  die,  can a guardian be appointed to take  over  the\r\n\r\ntrust?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to help me understand\r\n\r\nthese  queries,  because I feel that unless there  are  legal\r\n\r\nprovisions over the structure and ownership of the  trust,  I\r\n\r\nam  not  sure Singaporeans will step forward and pay  up  for\r\n\r\nthis  co-savings  scheme,  or it may  be  subject  to  abuse.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  do  we  know the savings pattern of  Singaporeans?\r\n\r\nWith  whatever money they have, would they prefer to put them\r\n\r\nwith  a life insurance scheme instead?  What is so attractive\r\n\r\nabout  this scheme, that is different from any other  savings\r\n\r\nscheme, Sir?  Can the money in this trust be invested for the\r\n\r\nchild?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On third child benefits in Part III of the Bill, Sir,\r\n\r\nwould  a  third  adopted baby by a self-employed  or  working\r\n\r\nmother  qualify  to enjoy this benefit, although  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnatural maternity, assuming that all the other conditions are\r\n\r\nmet?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entitlement is only served to a working woman who\r\n\r\nabsents  herself  from  work during the  period  of  4  weeks\r\n\r\nimmediately  before  and the period of  4  weeks  immediately\r\n\r\nafter  her  confinement.  The provisions in Part III,  clause\r\n\r\n9(1)(a)  and (b), seem to be materially similar and therefore\r\n\r\nrequire some editing to omit redundancy, in my opinion.  What\r\n\r\nis  peculiar is the provision which states that every  female\r\n\r\nemployee  shall  be  entitled to  absent  herself  from  work\r\n\r\n\"during  the period of 8 weeks, as agreed to by her  and  her\r\n\r\nemployer\".   If this Act becomes mandatory to be complied  by\r\n\r\nall employers, why is there a need for employees to reach  an\r\n\r\nagreement with employers to realise their entitlement?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entitlement is only given to women who have served\r\n\r\nthe  employer  for  not  less than  180  days,  as  MCDS  has\r\n\r\nexplained  in  the  papers,  \"the  purpose  is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nemployees to stay with the same employer for a minimum of six\r\n\r\nmonths,  which  is  usually  the  norm  for  confirmation  of\r\n\r\nemployment.\"  Sir, what if a six-month pregnant woman had  to\r\n\r\nleave  a  previous  job  to join a new company,  because  the\r\n\r\ncompany went bankrupt and she was retrenched?  Would she lose\r\n\r\nthe entitlement of a third child maternity benefit in the new\r\n\r\ncompany,  which she only served 120 days before the birth  of\r\n\r\nthe  baby?   This Bill does not provide for such  cases.   It\r\n\r\nwould seem to be that she lost out on two counts, for reasons\r\n\r\nbeyond  her own designs.  Can we look at how we could protect\r\n\r\npregnant  employees in such situations by  including  further\r\n\r\namendments to the Bill?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another extreme example, Sir, what if it is a\r\n\r\npremature birth for a new employee who has served maybe  less\r\n\r\nthan  180  days  in a company, will she be  entitled  to  the\r\n\r\nbenefit?  Or in the case of a pregnant mother who has  served\r\n\r\nthe company for more than 180 days, and she delivers a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremature  baby who survives in an incubator  for  the  first\r\n\r\nmonth  and  dies  afterwards, will she  be  entitled  to  the\r\n\r\nbenefit,   particularly, the four weeks benefit  due  to  her\r\n\r\nbefore the accidental birth?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal births, if a baby dies and therefore no\r\n\r\n\"birth\"  has occurred in the literal sense, will an  employee\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  maternity benefit and be paid regardless  of  the\r\n\r\noutcome?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of miscarriages during the third child\r\n\r\npregnancy, would this benefit apply?  The physical exhaustion\r\n\r\nand emotional torment of a miscarriage is already distressing\r\n\r\nenough.   It would be doubly punitive to take away  what  she\r\n\r\nwould be entitled to which nature has forbidden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For self-employed women, MCDS will pay them directly\r\n\r\nbased  on  their  claims.  I would then  ask:  how  does  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  verify the amount to be paid out to a hawker  or  a\r\n\r\nconsultant  employee  who may not file  accurate  income  tax\r\n\r\nforms  in  the  first  place?  Will they  accept  face  value\r\n\r\ndeclaration based on the claim forms?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last query is on Part III, clause 9(3), relating\r\n\r\nto  the  qualifying criteria for receiving  payment.   \"Being\r\n\r\nmarried\"  at  the  time of the child's birth  is  a  critical\r\n\r\ndetermining  factor.   What if three  women  in  their  third\r\n\r\npregnancy  during a week before their delivery due date,  one\r\n\r\nfound out that her husband is having an affair and decided to\r\n\r\nfile  for  divorce; the second decided to put a stop  to  her\r\n\r\nhusband's  physical violence and filed for divorce;  and  the\r\n\r\nthird  whose  husband was killed in an accident,  making  her\r\n\r\ninto a widow during her pregnancy, will these three women  be\r\n\r\nentitled to the maternity benefit?  I would like to hear  the\r\n\r\nMinister's position on these issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Part IV, Miscellaneous section, would the Minister\r\n\r\nclarify  how  and when will the women be paid, Sir?   If  the\r\n\r\nemployers are the ones to first fork out the money to pay  to\r\n\r\ntheir employees, and wait to be reimbursed by the Government,\r\n\r\nwhich  can  take as long as two months, is this not stressing\r\n\r\nsome of the SMEs'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncashflow  situation, especially if it is higher  level  staff\r\n\r\nclaiming legitimately as much as the total $20,000 cap?   The\r\n\r\ncashflow gets tighter when more women make such claims within\r\n\r\nthe  same  period in the same company.  Can we  consider  the\r\n\r\npayment  to  be  directly paid out to the  employees  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment instead, like the way we manage our own income tax\r\n\r\nclaims?  What is needed is setting up a special unit, or  let\r\n\r\nit be part of the functions of the Work Life Unit already set\r\n\r\nup in MCDS, to attend to such claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point relating to the failure of employer to pay\r\n\r\na  female employee, the Bill is silent what it will  do  with\r\n\r\nthe  money after it is recovered by the Government  from  the\r\n\r\noffending  employer.  Will the money be paid to the  employee\r\n\r\nthen?   The present provision appears to leave the mother  in\r\n\r\nthe cold as there are no provisions to divert the payment  to\r\n\r\nher.    I  hope  the  Minister  will  amend  Part  IV,  under\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous,  clause  17, to provide  some  protection  for\r\n\r\nemployees caught in these circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these points are clearly administrative and\r\n\r\nperhaps  procedural  details, which  will  be  addressed  and\r\n\r\nregulated by the Minister afterwards.  And I know it  may  be\r\n\r\ntoo  late now to make these necessary amendments, as the Bill\r\n\r\nwill  be passed by the end of this session and the Act  comes\r\n\r\ninto force by 1st April, as already announced in the papers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to put on record these concerns, and\r\n\r\nhope, where possible, they could be scrutinised over time  to\r\n\r\nhelp tighten up the intent and application of the Act so that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not leave too much leeway for unclear interpretation.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  most puzzling to me, and this perhaps reflects  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  lawmaking in having to provide policy  makers  an\r\n\r\navenue  to  manoeuvre  and  adapt  to  the  uniqueness  of  a\r\n\r\nsituation,  is the section on \"exemption\" in Part IV,  clause\r\n\r\n2,  which  states  that, \"The Minister may, subject  to  such\r\n\r\nterms  and  conditions as he may specify, exempt  any  person\r\n\r\nfrom complying with any requirement of this Act\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While appreciating the need to give the Minister some\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  power to exercise judgment, the  mandatoriness\r\n\r\nand  forcefulness of this Act became immediately diluted when\r\n\r\nit  is  silent  on the terms and conditions under  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister will exempt the person from complying with the terms\r\n\r\nof the Act.  I wish the legal provisions on this point can be\r\n\r\nclearer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the sentiment of this Bill in recognising\r\n\r\nthe   need  to  offer  some  financial  support  to  mothers.\r\n\r\nObviously, more should be done for a larger number  of  women\r\n\r\nto  benefit.  I hope this is only the beginning of a  process\r\n\r\nin shaping a child development and family policy in a gradual\r\n\r\nand  comprehensive manner.  In that defining process, I  hope\r\n\r\nthe governing principles are based on upholding the worth  of\r\n\r\nthe  child  and valuing the contribution of the  mother,  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not a numbers exercise, whether in expecting  an\r\n\r\noutcome  in  the number of births or limiting the  amount  of\r\n\r\ndollars to be paid out as support for mothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto speak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Minister to consider further\r\n\r\nmeasures  to encourage married couples in Singapore  to  have\r\n\r\nmore  children.   The Bill has addressed only  to  a  certain\r\n\r\nextent  the concerns young families have in regard to  having\r\n\r\nmore  children.   The Children Development Co-Savings  Scheme\r\n\r\nwill  alleviate their concern regarding the escalating  costs\r\n\r\nof  bringing up children.  Such costs are very real  for  the\r\n\r\nnew  generation of Singaporeans.  Not only has  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  gone up, the standard of living has also gone  up  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   For  example, during our time, it  was  quite  a\r\n\r\nrarity  for  families to engage tuition  teachers  for  their\r\n\r\nschool-going  children.   This  is  now  quite  a   prevalent\r\n\r\npractice for most young families and it is often a matter  of\r\n\r\nhow many private tutors the children have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third child maternity leave is an overdue\r\n\r\nrecognition of the sacrifices and national service  performed\r\n\r\nby young\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmothers.  It is a sacrifice because in the past, they had  to\r\n\r\naccumulate  their annual leave to offset their  absence  from\r\n\r\nwork  after  delivery of her third child.  It is a  sacrifice\r\n\r\nbecause  some employers and bosses do not take too kindly  to\r\n\r\nthe  mother's absence as this means that they have to arrange\r\n\r\nfor  someone else to cover duties.  In extreme cases, it  may\r\n\r\neven  affect  the promotion and prospect of the mother.   But\r\n\r\nthere  is  more  to  it than just the financial  concerns  of\r\n\r\nraising  a third child and of maternity leave.  The Bill  can\r\n\r\ngo  much  further to encourage young families  to  have  more\r\n\r\nchildren.  I have the following comments and suggestions  for\r\n\r\nthe Minister to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy is to have three children or\r\n\r\nmore if you can afford it.  This is a sensible policy because\r\n\r\nit  is generally better for less well-to-do families to  have\r\n\r\nlesser  children, so that the parents can have the  time  and\r\n\r\nmeans  to  raise their children up properly.  If the  parents\r\n\r\nwant to have many children but do not have the time and means\r\n\r\nto  bring  up the children well, it can be counter-productive\r\n\r\nto  the  family and society.  Hence, it is sensible  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to adopt a family planning policy of having  three\r\n\r\nchildren or more if the families can afford it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly then, the co-savings or \"baby bonus\"\r\n\r\nscheme  tends  to benefit the families with  the  means.   It\r\n\r\ntends  to favour families that can afford it because not  all\r\n\r\nfamilies   can  afford  $1,000  or  $2,000  annual   matching\r\n\r\ncontribution  for  the second and third  child  respectively.\r\n\r\nThe  flip side to this policy is that families from the lower\r\n\r\nincome  group  may  not  be able to benefit  fully  from  the\r\n\r\nscheme.   But we should ensure that families from  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group  are also properly taken care  of.   We  should\r\n\r\nensure  that  they are not significantly disadvantaged  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  scheme.  For this purpose, I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister can enlighten us on how the scheme will operate.  In\r\n\r\nparticular,  I  wish  to learn whether  this  scheme  can  be\r\n\r\nextended to cover other than \"baby bonus\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to some proposals I have for the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Bill should not focus on mothers. It\r\n\r\nshould not just encourage married women in Singapore to  have\r\n\r\nmore children.  It should encourage married men and women  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   to  have  more  children.   Notwithstanding   the\r\n\r\nsacrifices  made by mothers, we must not forget the  changing\r\n\r\nrole of fathers in a modern family.  The modern-day father is\r\n\r\nnot   just   a   breadwinner  enslaved  at   the   workplace.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, we are seeing more fathers wanting  to  play  a\r\n\r\nmore  instrumental role in raising up children,  in  tutoring\r\n\r\ntheir  children, in chauffeuring their children to piano  and\r\n\r\nother  special classes during the weekends.  In a sense,  the\r\n\r\nmodern-day father has no choice as the wife is often  also  a\r\n\r\nworking mother.  In a sense, the modern-day father has become\r\n\r\nless  chauvinistic.  And I know of many fathers who can  whip\r\n\r\nup excellent dishes in the kitchen.  So the modern-day father\r\n\r\nhas to assume his share of duty in getting the house in order\r\n\r\nand his share of responsibility in raising up the children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the changing role of fathers in our society,\r\n\r\nshould  not paternity leave be granted?  Paternity leave  can\r\n\r\nbe  a shorter period of, say, up to five working days for the\r\n\r\nfirst   and   second  child.   For  the  third   child,   the\r\n\r\nreimbursement  from the Government can then be  on  the  same\r\n\r\nbasis as the third child maternity leave, as proposed in  the\r\n\r\nBill for mothers.  The paternity leave will enable the father\r\n\r\nto  help ensure that the house and children are in order when\r\n\r\nthe mother is still in the hospital and in the first few days\r\n\r\nof  convalescence at home.  Having a new child in the  family\r\n\r\ncan  result in a major upheaval in the family and the  father\r\n\r\nhas  a  crucial role in helping the family to adjust  to  the\r\n\r\nchanges,  especially  in the initial  stages.   To  my  mind,\r\n\r\ngranting paternity leave would be a fair recognition  of  the\r\n\r\nfather's role in the family and, in a sense, encourage him to\r\n\r\nhave more children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, we should extend enhanced tax relief and\r\n\r\nrebates  to either parents and not just for working  mothers.\r\n\r\nThis is because mothers who are not in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  workforce are equally doing the country a great national\r\n\r\nservice by looking after their children in the crucial  early\r\n\r\nformative  years  of children.  I know of  many  professional\r\n\r\nwomen  who  stop working so as to be able to spend some  time\r\n\r\nwith  their children during their formative years.  We should\r\n\r\nnot forget their contributions to the society when they bring\r\n\r\nup  their children well.  They are also the heroines  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to propose that the Bill provide\r\n\r\nfor  special family leave of, say, up to five days  each  for\r\n\r\nmarried  employees with children.  This is to enable them  to\r\n\r\nuse  it to spend time to look after their children, to  coach\r\n\r\nthem  during the examination period, to look after them  when\r\n\r\nthey  are sick, to enjoy parenthood and not to treat it as  a\r\n\r\nbig  hassle  that they have to balance with  the  demands  of\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to understand that the values in our\r\n\r\nsociety are changing.  We have to understand that our younger\r\n\r\ngeneration  are  willing  to  go  out  to  make  a  mark  for\r\n\r\nthemselves  in  the office to actualise their potential.   At\r\n\r\nthe same time, they are faced with the ever pressures at home\r\n\r\nof having to raise their children.  Added to that is the fact\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  case of most young families, both parents  are\r\n\r\nworking.   It  is  not  easy  to raise  three  children  well\r\n\r\nnowadays  based on a single income.  Our society  has  become\r\n\r\ncompetitive.   Having  to raise a third  child  with  a  much\r\n\r\nlesser  measure of comfort, most young parents  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill opt for having two children.  Hence, we should recognise\r\n\r\nthis and go about to help them in this regard, by giving them\r\n\r\ntime to spend with their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, by the same token, I would like to propose\r\n\r\nthat  we  allow working mothers with new-borns to be able  to\r\n\r\ntake  no pay leave for up to six months on top of their  paid\r\n\r\nmaternity leave.  This is to help the working mothers in  the\r\n\r\nsettling  in  of their new-borns in the family.  The  working\r\n\r\nmother after her maternity leave may decide to take up to six\r\n\r\nmonths' no-pay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleave or she may not.  If her financial position requires her\r\n\r\nto  return  to  work after her maternity  leave,  it  is  her\r\n\r\ndecision to go back.  If her financial position allows her to\r\n\r\nstay at home to look after her new-born for up to six months,\r\n\r\nshe  can do so without the hassle of applying for it and  the\r\n\r\nuncertainty of whether that leave will be approved or not.  I\r\n\r\nknow  of  some  mothers  who returned  to  work  after  their\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave and were unable to cope with the demands  of\r\n\r\nwork  and  their  new-borns' attention.   Consequently,  they\r\n\r\ndecided to leave because they were not granted no-pay  leave.\r\n\r\nThis   situation   could  have  been  avoided.    But,   more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  by allowing them no-pay leave as a  right  will\r\n\r\ngive  parents the flexibility and therefore encourage working\r\n\r\ncouples to consider having more children seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, in line with most private sector practices, may\r\n\r\nI  also  propose  that  the Government  consider  a  five-day\r\n\r\nworking week to allow civil servants to spend more time  with\r\n\r\ntheir families.  Many civil servants have benefited from  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  arrangement  of  allowing  alternate  Saturday  off.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Government can take a further step by considering\r\n\r\na five-day working week.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sixth proposal concerns the tax deductibility of the\r\n\r\nforeign  maid levy which only a married woman who is  working\r\n\r\ngets.   In  line  with encouraging more children  and  bigger\r\n\r\nfamilies,  the  tax  deduction  should  be  extended  to  the\r\n\r\nfather's income.  This is because having more children  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of choice for the couple, and the choice of  having\r\n\r\nthe mother stay at home to be assisted by the maid should not\r\n\r\nresult in a financial penalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My seventh proposal is for the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nallowing  more  creches  and day care centres  for  children.\r\n\r\nAgain,  this would ease the concerns of double income working\r\n\r\nparents.   In order to encourage more childcare centres  near\r\n\r\nthe  workplace of working parents, the Minister may  wish  to\r\n\r\nconsider  giving  a  higher  subsidy  for  the  operators  of\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres  in  the  Central  Business  District  and\r\n\r\nindustrial areas where the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrental of office space can be rather prohibitive.  This would\r\n\r\nenable  parents  to send their children to childcare  centres\r\n\r\nnear  their working place and it would be more convenient  to\r\n\r\nfetch their children from the centre after work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, besides using financial carrots to\r\n\r\nencourage working mothers in Singapore to have more children,\r\n\r\nI  hope  the Government will also consider other measures  to\r\n\r\naddress the concerns of young families.  This issue has to be\r\n\r\nconsidered  in its totality.  Parents simply do not  opt  for\r\n\r\nmore  children  on the basis of co-savings  scheme  or  third\r\n\r\nchild maternity leave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these comments, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nBill  and I agree with the Minister that, taken together with\r\n\r\nother  programmes, there is a fair chance of  increasing  the\r\n\r\nbirth  rate.  Earlier speakers have already come out  with  a\r\n\r\nlong   list  of  possibilities  to  widen  and  enhance   the\r\n\r\nprovisions.  I have only three questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is with regard to clause 6 where it states\r\n\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"On the death of a member, the moneys standing to his\r\n\r\ncredit  in  his  bank  account shall be paid  to  the  Public\r\n\r\nTrustee  for disposal in accordance with any written law  for\r\n\r\nthe time being in force.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nI  am  just  seeking  clarification  that  this  money  would\r\n\r\nactually end up in the accounts of surviving siblings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is with regard to clause 9. I am\r\n\r\nglad that it has provided for self-employed women.  But I can\r\n\r\nthink  of a class of women, which is quite common, they  work\r\n\r\nespecially  in family provision stores and family businesses.\r\n\r\nFor  all intents and purposes, they contribute as much as the\r\n\r\nself-employed women but with no stature and no pay.  So I  am\r\n\r\njust wondering whether this class of women could be seriously\r\n\r\nconsidered even if it is only by a prescribed sum of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like the Minister to look at the\r\n\r\npossibility of dealing with clause 9(3)(b) where a  reference\r\n\r\nis made to being\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"lawfully married to the child's natural father\".   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhat  will  happen if it was discovered later that there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  case of infidelity.  Would the Government be  taking\r\n\r\nlegal   action  against  the  mother  and  claim   back   its\r\n\r\ncontributions?  Would the innocent child therefore lose  out?\r\n\r\nThere  is  also the possibility that the child could  be  the\r\n\r\nresult  of modern medicine, artificial insemination,  and  so\r\n\r\nforth,  and either or neither one of the parents is so-called\r\n\r\n\"natural\".   I  wonder whether it is absolutely necessary  to\r\n\r\ninclude the word \"natural\" in that section.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMembers  for their comments and views.  Let me first  address\r\n\r\nMdm  Claire Chiang's points.  Sir, Mdm Claire Chiang has been\r\n\r\nvery  robust  in her speech.  Let me start by beginning  from\r\n\r\nwhere she ended.  She said that it is not a numbers exercise,\r\n\r\nand  that is precisely what this is all about.  It is  not  a\r\n\r\nnumbers  exercise purely.  That is why when she said why  not\r\n\r\nopen  up to all women, open up to everybody, we have to think\r\n\r\ntwice about it.  It is not purely a numbers game.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She questioned the structure of the Children Development\r\n\r\nAccount.  As I have earlier mentioned, Sir, the account would\r\n\r\nessentially  be  a  Trust-Minor Account and  when  the  child\r\n\r\nreaches  school-going age, it will be transferred to Edusave.\r\n\r\nWhen the child grows up to over 21 years, it will go into his\r\n\r\nCPF  account.  So it is very clear.  And the funds are  meant\r\n\r\nfor  the  children's development, not for emergencies.   They\r\n\r\ncould  be  used for, as I mentioned, MCDS' licensed childcare\r\n\r\ncentres,   MOE's  registered  kindergartens  and   pre-school\r\n\r\nprogrammes and special education schools, and other uses  may\r\n\r\nbe considered at a later stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang asked if the trustee can be changed if a\r\n\r\nparent  should  die.   Yes, the other  parent  can  become  a\r\n\r\ntrustee.  I would like to assure Mdm Chiang that there  would\r\n\r\nbe  sufficient  legal provisions to make clear the  structure\r\n\r\nand ownership of the Children Development Account.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang also expressed doubts on whether parents\r\n\r\nwould opt to participate in the scheme.  Sir, it would really\r\n\r\nbe  up  to the parents whether to take up the scheme or  not.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  would like to emphasise that the co-savings component\r\n\r\nof  the  scheme  actually provides a guaranteed  100%  return\r\n\r\nevery  year  because we pay $1 for $1, and this excludes  the\r\n\r\ninterest paid by the bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked whether a mother who adopts a third child\r\n\r\nwould  be  eligible for the scheme.  The answer  is  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  not, simply because the intention of the scheme is  to\r\n\r\nraise  the total fertility rate.  Therefore, maternity  leave\r\n\r\nis  also meant for mothers who go through the pregnancy cycle\r\n\r\nand  confinement.   It  is also in line  with  the  maternity\r\n\r\nbenefits under the Employment Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked why under clause 9(1)(b), every female\r\n\r\nemployee  needs  to  come to an agreement with  the  employer\r\n\r\nabout the eight weeks' leave period if the Bill already makes\r\n\r\nit  mandatory.  Sir, I would like to point out  that  if  the\r\n\r\nemployee  opts to take the leave four weeks before  and  four\r\n\r\nweeks  after her confinement, that is a straight entitlement.\r\n\r\nBut  if  she  wants to take the eight weeks'  leave  starting\r\n\r\nlater,  she  would  need  to come to an  agreement  with  her\r\n\r\nemployer  as  to which date the leave would start,  and  this\r\n\r\npractice  is  no different from the maternity leave  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst and second child as stated in the Employment Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why the six months' rule is put in place\r\n\r\nis   really  to  prevent  the  possibility  of  women  taking\r\n\r\nadvantage of this scheme by joining the workforce just  prior\r\n\r\nto  her confinement.  On the possibility of a case raised  by\r\n\r\nMdm Chiang about the company going bankrupt and the woman  is\r\n\r\nretrenched, we do concede that there will be such cases,  but\r\n\r\nwe think they will be few and rare.  Rather than amending the\r\n\r\nBill  to provide for such exceptions, it is best that we take\r\n\r\nthem    on   a   case-by-case   basis   and   consider   them\r\n\r\nadministratively.  That we would do.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for babies who are born alive but die after some\r\n\r\ntime,  the  mothers would still be entitled to the  maternity\r\n\r\nleave provided they meet the other eligibility criteria.   If\r\n\r\na  child is stillborn or miscarried, the mother would not  be\r\n\r\neligible.   She  would however be given some  hospitalisation\r\n\r\nleave  for  her to recuperate.  Verification of self-employed\r\n\r\nmothers  would  be  calculated based on  the  average  income\r\n\r\nderived   from   self-employment  during   the   six   months\r\n\r\nimmediately  preceding the maternity leave.  A  self-employed\r\n\r\nreimbursement  board has been set up to approve  the  claims,\r\n\r\nand  this  board is similar to the board set  up  to  approve\r\n\r\nclaims for self-employed NSmen to make up their pay claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang also mentioned a number of scenarios whereby\r\n\r\nthe mother ceases to be married after the child is conceived.\r\n\r\nYes, mothers in all these cases will still be entitled to the\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave  because  they  would  have  satisfied   the\r\n\r\ncondition  of  being lawfully married to the child's  natural\r\n\r\nfather at the time the child is conceived.  And why the  need\r\n\r\nfor the employer to pay the employees first?  Sir, this would\r\n\r\nensure that the mother receives her pay promptly.  And  MCDS,\r\n\r\nI assure her, has set service standards for the reimbursement\r\n\r\nof  employers  and,  upon submission of  the  claims  by  the\r\n\r\nemployers,  MCDS will pay the employers within a  month  from\r\n\r\nthe  receipt  of  submission, if  the  claims  are  submitted\r\n\r\nmanually,  and within three weeks if the claims are submitted\r\n\r\nelectronically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her last point about the employer failing to pay the\r\n\r\nfemale  employee, action will be taken against them  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would ensure that the mother is fully paid,  as  I\r\n\r\nmentioned in my earlier speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to Dr Vasoo. Dr Vasoo has got a very\r\n\r\ninteresting question about why only \"married women\", and  not\r\n\r\n\"married couples\".  Sir, we must accept that it is a  married\r\n\r\nwoman,  and  not  married  couple, who  has  children  simply\r\n\r\nbecause,  ultimately,  it  is the woman  who  has  to  decide\r\n\r\nwhether  or not she wants to have the child and she  will  be\r\n\r\nbearing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  children,  not the couple.  But we do  accept  that  the\r\n\r\ndecision  to have children will have to be something  between\r\n\r\nthe  married couple.  And we are not too sure whether we want\r\n\r\nto  use  the  words \"married couple\" because  sometimes,  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"married  couple\"  differs  from  society  to\r\n\r\nsociety.  So we would rather stick to \"married women\"  and  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  the Member that when we say \"married women\",  we\r\n\r\nare  talking about married couples because we want to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  children  are  born within wedlock and  the  family  is\r\n\r\nintact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether there would be any discrimination of\r\n\r\nincome  and  whether  the  lower  income  families  would  be\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged.  The answer is no.  As long as the  parent  or\r\n\r\nthe  mother  satisfies the criteria, she will  be  given  the\r\n\r\nbonus,  regardless of what income group she comes  from.   In\r\n\r\nterms of childcare, quite apart from this, we also have  what\r\n\r\nwe  call  the centre-based financial assistance for childcare\r\n\r\nwhich  I  mentioned earlier in my speech during the Committee\r\n\r\nof  Supply.   My  Ministry will give  additional  subsidy  to\r\n\r\nchildren   from  low  income  families  to  attend  childcare\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee asked whether women who work free for\r\n\r\nfamilies  would be eligible for maternity leave.  The  answer\r\n\r\nis  no.  Because the objective of the maternity leave benefit\r\n\r\nis  to  compensate  for loss of income.   Also,  it  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to determine the actual amount that person  should\r\n\r\nbe  paid, whether she helps out in the hawker centre,  or  in\r\n\r\nthe  father's firm.  How do you reconcile and how do you want\r\n\r\nto  pay them?  So we would leave it as it is and we only  pay\r\n\r\nfor  working women.  It is really to compensate the  loss  in\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the provision in the Bill on \"lawfully\r\n\r\nmarried to the child's natural father\".  This is, as  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  because  we want to encourage  child  birth  within\r\n\r\nwedlock and the family remains intact.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> I just want to clarify the position. I\r\n\r\nagree   with  the  words  \"lawfully  married\".   But   I   am\r\n\r\nquestioning the word \"natural\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Yes. I know where he is coming\r\n\r\nfrom  when he said that, because he did mention also what  if\r\n\r\nthe  child is conceived out of artificial insemination.  Sir,\r\n\r\nin  such cases, if there is no paternity challenge and if the\r\n\r\ncouple  accept  the  child as their own, then  they  will  be\r\n\r\neligible.  This is where administrative consideration will be\r\n\r\ngiven.   It  is  not our intention to deny  payment  to  that\r\n\r\nparticular child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo asked whether children who are born\r\n\r\nprematurely would be considered.  I am afraid not.  When  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister announced the scheme at the National Day Rally\r\n\r\non 20th August last year, he did mention that we were already\r\n\r\nbeing  generous  to the early babies by implementing  on  1st\r\n\r\nApril  2001.  However if there is strong medical evidence  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  a baby was conceived after PM's  announcement,\r\n\r\nbut  the  baby arrived early, that is, premature birth,  then\r\n\r\nMCDS would consider on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of \"baby bonus\" for parenting and marriage\r\n\r\ncourses, the intention is for the \"baby bonus\" to be used for\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres and kindergartens.  But  the  families  or\r\n\r\nparents  are free to use the first tier for parenting courses\r\n\r\nand informal childcare arrangement.  In fact, one of the main\r\n\r\nreasons  for  creating  the  first  tier  is  to  allow  this\r\n\r\nflexibility  by  parents to use this  cash  amount  for  such\r\n\r\nprogrammes or projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the procedures for the claims, we assure her, will\r\n\r\nbe  simple.  We would not make it complicated.  We think  the\r\n\r\nemployers  and  employees have enough time  to  submit  their\r\n\r\nclaims.   Even if the employee provides only a week's  notice\r\n\r\nbefore  confinement,  for example,  the  employer  has  three\r\n\r\nmonths  to  submit claims as the deadline is one month  after\r\n\r\nthe  expiry of the maternity leave.  But, again, we  will  be\r\n\r\nflexible  if  there are valid reasons for  late  claims.   In\r\n\r\nother words, we will not penalise people as it were.  We want\r\n\r\nto  pay  them.  We want to make sure that this scheme  works.\r\n\r\nWanting to have children and wanting to build a family  is  a\r\n\r\nvery personal choice.  We cannot demand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  by fiat.  No government can demand it by fiat.  It has to\r\n\r\nbe  a  personal choice.  But the Government could  facilitate\r\n\r\nand  encourage by having schemes like this.  Our feedback has\r\n\r\nbeen that families or parents who have their first child,  or\r\n\r\nwant to have their first child, usually do not have financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to have their second or third child, but baulk\r\n\r\nat  it either because of financial or other constraints,  and\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  will  try to address that financial  obstacle  of\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rights of employees, yes, the rights\r\n\r\nof  employees are protected and, as I mentioned earlier in my\r\n\r\nspeech,  the  Bill has provisions to punish errant  employers\r\n\r\nwho do not pay the maternity benefits to their employees.  In\r\n\r\nfact, it is the same in the Employment Act too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong asked what the specific details are. Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  details  of  the  scheme will be  released  soon  by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry.   But let us start with what we have first,  before\r\n\r\nwe  extend  it to other uses.  We must realise that  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  unique.  There is no precedent  for  such  an  Act\r\n\r\nhere, so we will have to proceed slowly, and we will have  to\r\n\r\nmodify  and  fine-tune along the way.  The  low-income  group\r\n\r\nwill   not  be  at  a  disadvantage,  because  the  co-saving\r\n\r\nprinciple    is   important   to   emphasise   the    primary\r\n\r\nresponsibility of parents to care for their children.  The co-saving period actually allows parents the time to save and to\r\n\r\nmake deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For paternity and other leave, I suggest we stick to the\r\n\r\npresent  measures first before we review the leave provisions\r\n\r\nfurther and consider changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for subsidies for childcare operators in CBD, the\r\n\r\nMinistry   actually  already  has  in  place  provisions   to\r\n\r\nencourage  employers to set up creches and childcare  centres\r\n\r\nat  their workplace.  For example, we give capital grants for\r\n\r\nconversion of premises, and for furnishing and equipment,  if\r\n\r\nthey want to turn part of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir premises to childcare centres or creches.  We also have\r\n\r\ntax incentives for employers who set up childcare centres  in\r\n\r\ntheir  workplace.  With regard to foreign maid levy,  as  you\r\n\r\nknow, it is being paid to the working mother, and it does not\r\n\r\nstop the working mother from using whatever savings there are\r\n\r\nfrom the levy, for the rest of the family.  In any case,  the\r\n\r\nforeign  maid levy is beyond the scope of this Bill.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot to modify, change or improve the scope of the maid levy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, Sir, having children and raising\r\n\r\na  family  are ultimately personal decisions.  The Government\r\n\r\ncan  and will try to help to facilitate, and I can assure the\r\n\r\nHouse that we will be as flexible and as generous as we  can.\r\n\r\nWe all want children.  We want children to be a joy, not just\r\n\r\nanother  burden  to the family, and we want our  children  to\r\n\r\nfeel wanted.  Any sacrifice that parents make in raising them\r\n\r\nmust be a labour of love and an expression of love.  And  the\r\n\r\nChildren Development Co-Savings Bill, Sir, is one of the many\r\n\r\nmeasures and instruments that we have and would put in  place\r\n\r\nto achieve these ends.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, can I clarify three\r\n\r\nquestions?   I  am still not convinced why this  Bill  cannot\r\n\r\ncover all women and all births.  I am not satisfied with  the\r\n\r\nanswer.   The Minister also said that this Bill precisely  is\r\n\r\nnot  just  about numbers.  I wish he would clarify  a  little\r\n\r\nmore  on  this statement.  If it is a stillborn, the Minister\r\n\r\nsaid that maternity leave will be given to help the woman  to\r\n\r\nrecuperate.   I  would  like  to  know  whether  it  is  paid\r\n\r\nmaternity  leave.  The third question is: would the  Minister\r\n\r\ninfluence and appeal to the public hospitals not to  increase\r\n\r\nhospitalisation charges for baby No. 4 and above?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, this is precisely what we are\r\n\r\ntalking  about, ie, it is not just a question  about  numbers\r\n\r\nper  se, and I would like to refer to what Mr Noris Ong said,\r\n\r\nabout  having  three or more children, if we can  afford  it.\r\n\r\nThis means, as I mentioned just now in my speech too, that we\r\n\r\ndo not want children\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  a  burden.   We want children to be wanted,  we  want\r\n\r\nchildren  to  be loved.  So we must make sure  that  children\r\n\r\nwhom  we bring into this world, will be children who will  be\r\n\r\nloved  and will not be a burden to the family.  And  we  must\r\n\r\nmake sure that the parents can cope with taking care of their\r\n\r\nchildren.   That is what I mean by it is not  a  question  of\r\n\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to stillborns, I am not too sure, but I\r\n\r\nthink  it  will  be  paid maternity leave.   With  regard  to\r\n\r\nwhether I would ask the hospitals to extend this to cover the\r\n\r\nfourth child, I would have to speak to Mr Lim Hng Kiang,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health.  By the way, the work group on this also\r\n\r\nincludes representatives from the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One last clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I am sure those\r\n\r\nmothers  who have more than four children want their children\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are loved and because they want the  children.\r\n\r\nWho  is  to decide then whether those children are loved  and\r\n\r\nwanted?

I will leave the best  speech\r\n\r\nto the last.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to thank the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker\r\n\r\nfor listening to the hundreds of speeches made by the MPs and\r\n\r\nthe  replies given by the Ministers.  It has been a very long\r\n\r\nsitting.   I  am  sure  we  have  heard  exhaustive   replies\r\n\r\nconcerning many issues but, despite this, MPs do not seem  to\r\n\r\nget tired.  Just by looking at the number of speeches made on\r\n\r\nthe  seven  Bills, a total of 19 apart from  the  two  Supply\r\n\r\nBills,  in addition to those by the Ministers in their Second\r\n\r\nReading, I think we have covered quite a lot in the last four\r\n\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on this note, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, during the tea break, the\r\n\r\nLeader  of the House asked me if I would be having  the  last\r\n\r\nword.   He  did  not exactly say that I should make  a  short\r\n\r\nspeech,  but he did mention to me that it has been two  weeks\r\n\r\nof  many, many speeches, and he reminded me that today  would\r\n\r\nbe  a long day.  But have no fear, hon. Members.  As you  are\r\n\r\nall  aware, I am not well-disposed towards lengthy  speeches,\r\n\r\nfrom me or from others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the tradition at the end of the Budget debate for\r\n\r\nthe  Speaker to say \"Thank you\" to all of you, and  I  always\r\n\r\nmake it a point every year to tell you how interesting I find\r\n\r\nyour speeches except that, every year, when I say this, as  I\r\n\r\nlook  around at your faces, I cannot help but get the feeling\r\n\r\nthat some of you are not quite convinced by what I said.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  somebody  asked me a while ago why  is  it  that  your\r\n\r\nDeputy  and you look so expressionless at times.  I think  he\r\n\r\nwas trying to tell me in his own polite way, \"Why do you look\r\n\r\nso  bored?\"  But, hon. Members, far, far from it.  It is just\r\n\r\nthat both my Deputy and I are not, shall I say, well-inclined\r\n\r\ntowards displaying visual expressions of exuberance, at least\r\n\r\nnot in the Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you have been unceremoniously \"guillotined\", and\r\n\r\nI do extend my apologies for that.  But some things in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  -  and the Committee of Supply is one of them  -  have\r\n\r\nto  be regulated with a kind of precision clockwork, and that\r\n\r\nis  something I am quite familiar with, as you know.  So,  if\r\n\r\nwe  had  to  cut  you down, and I know it  is  very  painful,\r\n\r\nespecially when you are just reaching that high point in your\r\n\r\nspeech, to be told that time is up, again, our apologies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, hon. Members, I thank you for your\r\n\r\ncooperation and for the effort that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  have put in during these past two weeks.
