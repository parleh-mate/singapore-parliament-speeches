In  view  of  the\r\n\r\nmassive  urban  renewal programme  that  is  being\r\n\r\ncarried  out  to  the  city and  the  Government's\r\n\r\ndesire  to  further  implement  the  Garden   City\r\n\r\nconcept,  it  has  been found  necessary  to  make\r\n\r\ncertain   amendments  to  the   Local   Government\r\n\r\nIntegration Act to empower the Director of  Public\r\n\r\nWorks to achieve this objective more readily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now draw Members' attention to the more\r\n\r\nsignificant clauses of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 seeks to add a new section 16A to the\r\n\r\nAct to facilitate the vesting in the Government of\r\n\r\nlands  which have been set aside as road  reserves\r\n\r\npursuant to development proposals approved by  the\r\n\r\ncompetent  authority under the Planning  Act.  All\r\n\r\nthese  road  reserves will eventually be  made  up\r\n\r\ninto  new  or  enlarged  public  streets.  It   is\r\n\r\ncustomary  for  the owners of lands  to  agree  to\r\n\r\nsurrender part of their lands for road reserves to\r\n\r\nthe Government without charge in consideration  of\r\n\r\nthe approval given for their development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplans.  The  new section 16A will facilitate  the\r\n\r\nvesting in the Government of such lands which have\r\n\r\nbeen set aside as road reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 seeks to amend section 18 of the Act to\r\n\r\nempower  the Government to require a developer  or\r\n\r\nowner  of a property constructing a new street  to\r\n\r\nmake provision for the planting of trees along the\r\n\r\nnew  street. Section 18 of the Act is also amended\r\n\r\nto  require  any person erecting any  building  or\r\n\r\nplanting of any hedge within any land set aside as\r\n\r\na  road reserve to seek the prior approval of  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Public Works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to amend section 28 of the Act,\r\n\r\nwhich  empowers  the Director of Public  Works  to\r\n\r\nacquire  premises for the widening of streets,  to\r\n\r\nprovide that no compensation shall be payable  for\r\n\r\nthe  acquisition of any premises for the  purposes\r\n\r\nof  street-making when the premises are within the\r\n\r\nstreet   reserves  set  aside  pursuant   to   any\r\n\r\ndevelopment  proposal approved  by  the  competent\r\n\r\nauthority.  Since  the owner of the  premises  has\r\n\r\nagreed to surrender the land free of charge to the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Government should not pay for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding standing on the premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 seeks to amend section 58 of the Act to\r\n\r\nenable  the Director of Public Works to  construct\r\n\r\nback-lanes  and to recover the cost  thereof  from\r\n\r\nthe  owners  of  properties fronting  these  back-lanes.  Under the existing provision the  cost  of\r\n\r\nconstructing   back-lanes   is   borne   by    the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 seeks to amend section 102 of the Act\r\n\r\nto  empower  the  competent  authority  to  impose\r\n\r\ninterest  charges at a rate not exceeding  6%  per\r\n\r\nannum for late payments levied under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr E.

In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of land held under a State  lease,  the\r\n\r\nowner   may   make   an  application   under   the\r\n\r\nApportionment  of  Rents Act for apportionment  of\r\n\r\nthe  rent  payable in respect of the  land,  where\r\n\r\nthere  has  been a subdivision. The Act does  not,\r\n\r\nhowever, make it mandatory for the owner  to  make\r\n\r\nan application for apportionment and often no such\r\n\r\napplication is made. In such a case, the Collector\r\n\r\nof  Land Revenue can only apportion the rent  when\r\n\r\nthe subdivision of the land subsequently comes  to\r\n\r\nhis knowledge. This procedure has been found to be\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory and entails delay in  apportionment\r\n\r\nof the rent. Moreover, land held under a Statutory\r\n\r\nLand  Grant  does not at present fall  within  the\r\n\r\nambit  of  the  Apportionment  of  Rents  Act.  An\r\n\r\napportionment  of the rent payable in  respect  of\r\n\r\nsuch land is done administratively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House will make it\r\n\r\nmandatory for the owner of land held either  on  a\r\n\r\nState  lease or a Statutory Land Grant  to  inform\r\n\r\nthe  Collector  of Land Revenue  of  any  approved\r\n\r\nsubdivision of his land by the Competent Authority\r\n\r\nunder  the Planning Act, so that the apportionment\r\n\r\nof  the  rent  may be appropriately  made  without\r\n\r\ndelay. Under the Bill a penalty not exceeding $500\r\n\r\nwill  be  imposed  for  non-compliance  with  this\r\n\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to request the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  explain  to this  House  why  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to make it obligatory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  a  landowner to inform the Collector of  Land\r\n\r\nRevenue of any approved subdivision. Why not  make\r\n\r\nit obligatory for the relevant authority to inform\r\n\r\nthe  Collector of Land Revenue of the  subdivision\r\n\r\nwhen  approving the application? I can  understand\r\n\r\nthe  situation where if a landowner subdivides his\r\n\r\nland  without Government approval, then it is fair\r\n\r\nthat he must inform the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it rather difficult to perceive in this\r\n\r\nparticular situation where the Government approves\r\n\r\nan  application  for  land  subdivision  and  then\r\n\r\nrequires  the  landowner to inform the  Government\r\n\r\nthat  his  application has been  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. I would have thought that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nsimple inter-departmental communication - one  arm\r\n\r\nof  the  Government telling the other arm what  is\r\n\r\nhappening.  Why  rely  on the  people  to  do  the\r\n\r\ntransmission  work  and  then  penalise  them   on\r\n\r\ndefault?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, sometimes, as the Member has pointed out in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget debate, one Government department does\r\n\r\nnot  inform the other department. It usually does,\r\n\r\nbut  sometimes  one  does not catch  up  with  the\r\n\r\nother. Therefore, the object of the Bill is to put\r\n\r\nthe burden on the applicant, whose application for\r\n\r\nsubdivision  has  been approved,  to  in-form  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  department  so that  the  Collector  may\r\n\r\napportion the rent. The penalty provided is really\r\n\r\nnot excessive for non-compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, first of all, may I say that I fully support\r\n\r\nthis   amendment  Bill.  I  would  like  to   seek\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister. 1  note  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  Explanatory Statement to the Bill  a  penalty\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding  $500  will  be  imposed  for  non-compliance with this new requirement. I think this\r\n\r\npenalty  is  far  too small a  sum  to  impose.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that during the property boom land  prices\r\n\r\nsoared up to incredible levels. As a result, quite\r\n\r\na number of landowners put up subdivisions of land\r\n\r\nfor  eventual sale. If that is the case, then  the\r\n\r\npenalty on them must be heavy enough to deter them\r\n\r\nfrom  taking the law into their own hands. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister would care to clarify this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there is nothing to clarify. This is a new\r\n\r\namendment and, in the light of what the Member for\r\n\r\nKim  Keat has stated, I would prefer to leave  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  penalty at $500 rather than to  impose  a\r\n\r\npunishment which might be too punitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said that the\r\n\r\npurpose of the Bill is to enable the Collector  of\r\n\r\nLand  Revenue to apportion the rent. I am  of  the\r\n\r\nview  that  it is rather premature to  inform  the\r\n\r\nCollector  within  one  month  from  the  date  of\r\n\r\nobtaining   approval  of  subdivision   from   the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authority, as the land  would  still  be\r\n\r\nunder the same ownership at that stage. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  question  of apportionment of rent  does  not\r\n\r\narise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the owner of the land may decide not to\r\n\r\nproceed  further  with  the  subdivision.  He  may\r\n\r\ndecide  not  to  obtain separate  titles  for  the\r\n\r\nsubdivided  plot  through the  Registrar  of  Land\r\n\r\nTitles  and Deeds. The apportionment of rent  will\r\n\r\nonly  be  effected when separate  titles  for  the\r\n\r\napproved  subdivided plots are issued.  Would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  not  agree then that it  would  be  more\r\n\r\nappropriate for the Collector of Land  Revenue  to\r\n\r\nbe  informed at that stage in order to enable  him\r\n\r\nto apportion the rent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> No, Sir. The lessee or grantee is asked, after he\r\n\r\nhas obtained written permission from the competent\r\n\r\nauthority to subdivide his land, to inform or make\r\n\r\na  notification to the Collector in writing within\r\n\r\none month from the date of approval. If he changes\r\n\r\nhis  mind,  he  can  always inform  the  Collector\r\n\r\nagain.   But  the  important  date  is  when   the\r\n\r\nsubdivision has taken place. Conveyance  might  be\r\n\r\ndone later. 1 think one month should be ample time\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of this Bill. In any event should\r\n\r\nthe  Member  be  proved right, and  if  there  are\r\n\r\nteething  troubles with this Bill, we will  extend\r\n\r\nthis period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nexplanation.

We know that ordinary  citizens\r\n\r\nare  not conversant with the numerous legislations\r\n\r\nthat  exist and are usually unaware of the  hidden\r\n\r\nrules  and  regulations which are introduced  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time as amendments are made to  this  or\r\n\r\nthat  Act.  May I request the Minister, therefore,\r\n\r\nto  assure  the  House that he will  instruct  the\r\n\r\nrelevant authority, when approving any subdivision\r\n\r\nof land, to advise the landowner of his obligation\r\n\r\nto  inform the Collector of Land Revenue  of  such\r\n\r\napproval  within  one  month  from  the  date   of\r\n\r\ngranting of the written permission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, Sir, we will do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr E.W.

These\r\n\r\namendments, if passed, will in no way detract from\r\n\r\nthe  paramount policy of the principal Act,  which\r\n\r\nis to safeguard the interests of hirers under hire\r\n\r\npurchase  agreements, as part of the larger  field\r\n\r\nof consumer protection. They will, however, ensure\r\n\r\nthat hirers will be less likely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  abuse their rights under the agreements to the\r\n\r\ndisadvantage of the lawful owners of  these  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 which amends section 26 of the Act makes\r\n\r\nit  mandatory for a hirer to inform the  owner  of\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle  (the finance company) in  the  event\r\n\r\nthat he changes his registered insurer during  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  the  hire-purchase agreement.  In  the\r\n\r\npast,  the new registered insurer, not being aware\r\n\r\nof  the  interest  in  the motor  vehicle  of  the\r\n\r\nfinance  company,  have, in some instances,  where\r\n\r\nthere  has been a claim on a total loss  basis  by\r\n\r\nthe  insured hirer, made payments on a total  loss\r\n\r\nbasis  direct  to the hirer. Although  the  owners\r\n\r\nhave  a  right at common law to sue the  hirer  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  their interest in the motor  vehicle,\r\n\r\nthis  has  not  been  shown to be  a  satisfactory\r\n\r\nremedy,  for  hirers have been known to  disappear\r\n\r\nwith  the  insurance  monies  received  from   the\r\n\r\ninsurers.  This amendment, accordingly,  places  a\r\n\r\nlegal obligation upon the hirer, who by virtue  of\r\n\r\nsection  26  (1) of the Act alone must choose  his\r\n\r\nregistered  insurer, to advise  the  owner  if  he\r\n\r\ndecides to change his insurer. The owner will then\r\n\r\ninform  the insurer of his interest in  the  motor\r\n\r\nvehicle under the Hire-Purchase agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 33 (c) of the Act in such\r\n\r\na   way  as  to  provide  greater  flexibility  in\r\n\r\nadjusting   interest  rates  payable  on   overdue\r\n\r\ninstalments.  With  the recent  rise  in  interest\r\n\r\nrates  in money markets the existing provision  in\r\n\r\nthis  section  fixing a ceiling of  9%  per  annum\r\n\r\nwhich finance companies may charge is unrealistic,\r\n\r\nhaving  regard to the cost of these  companies  of\r\n\r\nborrowing money. It is, therefore, proposed that a\r\n\r\nmaximum  rate of 12% per annum should be fixed  in\r\n\r\nsection 33 (c) but at the same time to confer upon\r\n\r\nthe  Minister power to determine such  lower  rate\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time as he may think fit. This lower\r\n\r\nrate,   it   is   envisaged,   should   correspond\r\n\r\napproximately  to  prevailing  commercial   rates.\r\n\r\nThough interest rates now appear to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  a  downtrend, they are likely to  remain  well\r\n\r\nabove historical rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major amendment appears in clause 8\r\n\r\nwhich  amends the Fourth Schedule. The  effect  of\r\n\r\nthis  amendment will be to reduce  the  number  of\r\n\r\nnotices to repossess (under section 15 (1) )  that\r\n\r\nare  sent  out by finance companies to hirers  who\r\n\r\ntend to be continually in default in their payment\r\n\r\nof  instalments. Such hirers often find themselves\r\n\r\nin  further  arrears  of  instalments  which  have\r\n\r\nfallen  due  after  the date of  the  notice.  The\r\n\r\nexisting  Notice, therefore, fails to reflect  the\r\n\r\ntrue  position of the amount of arrears  that  are\r\n\r\ndue  up to the time that the finance company takes\r\n\r\naction to repossess. The amendment, accordingly is\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  deal with this matter  by  providing\r\n\r\nthat  the  hirer, in order to avoid  repossession,\r\n\r\nmust  pay  all  arrears of instalments  that  have\r\n\r\nfallen due since the date of the Notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the amendments proposed in clauses 4, 5,\r\n\r\n6  and  7  seek to increase the penalties provided\r\n\r\nfor in sections 35, 36, 37 and 38 respectively  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act.

It is also possible that  his\r\n\r\nfamily  will  have to go along with him,  and  the\r\n\r\nflat  will  be left vacant. If this is  the  case,\r\n\r\nwill  the Minister consider, in view of the nature\r\n\r\nof  work  to  which the flat owner  is  committed,\r\n\r\nallowing the owner to continue to own the flat  in\r\n\r\nhis  name?  I have come across a case which  comes\r\n\r\nunder  this particular provision as laid  down  in\r\n\r\nthis proposed new section 48A (1) (i) in clause 10\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government has all along been\r\n\r\nadvocating  the policy of home ownership  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  in order to look after their welfare.  The\r\n\r\npeople  can  thus own their own homes and  have  a\r\n\r\nsense  of  security in life. This  amendment  Bill\r\n\r\ntherefore has come as a surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain provisions in the Bill are rather vague\r\n\r\nand  will  cause concern and confusion  among  the\r\n\r\npeople.  I  am  referring  particularly   to   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of clauses 5 and 8 of the Bill which, I\r\n\r\nthink,  ought to be clarified. Clause  5  provides\r\n\r\nthat  no  person shall be entitled to purchase  an\r\n\r\nHDB  flat  if  he,  his spouse or  any  authorised\r\n\r\noccupier,  is  the  owner of any  other  immovable\r\n\r\nproperty.  What will be the position of  a  person\r\n\r\nwho  owns a shophouse or a nonresidential property\r\n\r\nin  the  name  of  a company or  on  behalf  of  a\r\n\r\ncompany, or who jointly owns such property with  a\r\n\r\ncompany?  Will he be entitled to apply to purchase\r\n\r\na  Housing  Board flat? According  to  the  Public\r\n\r\nRelations Officer of the HDB, after the  Bill  has\r\n\r\nbeen   passed  the  Housing  Board  will  announce\r\n\r\ndetails  specifying the circumstances under  which\r\n\r\npersons  are entitled to purchase flats and  those\r\n\r\nwho  are not entitled to purchase flats. May I ask\r\n\r\nwhy should the details of these new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions  be explained to the people  after  the\r\n\r\nBill  has  been passed? Is this not tantamount  to\r\n\r\neffecting the law before any prior information has\r\n\r\nbeen  given? The people who suffer will  be  those\r\n\r\nwho  live  in the HDB flats. They will be  at  the\r\n\r\nmercy  of  the Housing Board after due passage  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. Therefore, I hope the Minister will  be\r\n\r\nable  to clarify these two vague provisions as  to\r\n\r\nwhich  category of persons possessing which  types\r\n\r\nof  property are or are not entitled to  buy  HDB.\r\n\r\nflats,  so  as  to  enable us  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nintentions  of  this  Bill  and  its  measures  in\r\n\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another provision in the Bill provides that,\r\n\r\nunder certain circumstances, the Housing Board can\r\n\r\nrepossess  a  flat upon the death  of  the  owner,\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not the owner has left a will.  Again\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Board officials also said that  after\r\n\r\nthe Bill has been passed and become law, the Board\r\n\r\nwill   notify   the   people  concerned   of   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances under which the flat could be bought\r\n\r\nback  by  the  Board upon the death  of  the  flat\r\n\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would consider the fact\r\n\r\nthat  flat owners are not wealthy property owners.\r\n\r\nMost  of them are not conversant with the law  and\r\n\r\nbeing in the low-income group they are not able to\r\n\r\ntake  on any additional burden that is imposed  on\r\n\r\nthem. The Government should have sympathy for  the\r\n\r\nhardship  of  the  people  and  simplify  all  the\r\n\r\nnecessary procedures. The Government should follow\r\n\r\nthe  example of the Central Provident  Fund  Board\r\n\r\nsystem  of  authorising  a  nominee  successor  to\r\n\r\nadministrate the estate, which system is  for  the\r\n\r\nconvenience of the people and also to reduce their\r\n\r\nburden. I hope the Minister can enlighten us  with\r\n\r\na  clarification as well as a direction  on  these\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in general support of the\r\n\r\namendment Bill. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  feel that clause 5, which prohibits persons who\r\n\r\nhave  sold property within 30 months prior to date\r\n\r\nof  application,  has  the unfortunate  effect  of\r\n\r\npenalising widows and orphans who may be forced by\r\n\r\ncircumstances to sell their homes. Such widows and\r\n\r\norphans  will then be forced to wait six or  seven\r\n\r\nyears  before getting a flat. I hope the Minister:\r\n\r\nwill amend this particular clause of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, as I pointed out earlier, the whole purpose\r\n\r\nof  this Bill is to ensure that the Board's  flats\r\n\r\nremain in the hands of people who deserve them and\r\n\r\nto  avoid  frustration  by those  on  the  Board's\r\n\r\nwaiting  list.  At  the moment, there  are  75,000\r\n\r\napplicants  wanting to buy flats and about  25,000\r\n\r\nwanting  to rent them. The object of this Bill  is\r\n\r\nnot to make things worse for widows and orphans or\r\n\r\nfor the poor people living in HDB flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spelt out earlier in my speech details of\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances  under which  people  who  have\r\n\r\nbought  flats  will lose them.  In  my  view,  the\r\n\r\nprovisions set out under clauses 5 and 8 are quite\r\n\r\nclear.  One  deals  with the  position  where  the\r\n\r\nowner,  his  spouse or any authorised occupier  is\r\n\r\nthe  owner  of any other flat, house, building  or\r\n\r\nland or has an estate or interest therein; or has,\r\n\r\nat  any time within 30 months immediately prior to\r\n\r\nthe date of making an application to the Board  to\r\n\r\npurchase a flat, sold any flat, house, building or\r\n\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa takes objection to the 30-month condition. It has been the experience of the\r\n\r\nBoard  that  this period is reasonable enough  for\r\n\r\npeople  to dispose of their properties, which  may\r\n\r\nbe  substantial properties, and with the  proceeds\r\n\r\nbuy a five-room flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol is worried about people\r\n\r\nwho have to leave the country after buying a flat.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not have to give up the flat.  All  they\r\n\r\nhave to do in such cases is to inform the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other clause which deals with the\r\n\r\nposition  where  the owner of an  HDB  flat  dies,\r\n\r\neither  testate or intestate and his executors  or\r\n\r\nadministrators do nothing about it for years,  the\r\n\r\npurpose  is to give them one year which should  be\r\n\r\nenough   time  to  take  out  either  Letters   of\r\n\r\nAdministration or Probate of the Will so that  the\r\n\r\nlegal  formalities in respect of the flat  can  be\r\n\r\nput right. Otherwise if they do nothing, the Board\r\n\r\ncannot do anything. Hence this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr E.

Section  5\r\n\r\nlists  offences  for negligence,  irregularity  or\r\n\r\nmisconduct.  A disciplinary committee  of  inquiry\r\n\r\nwill determine the degree of culpability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 14 pensions are withheld completely\r\n\r\nfor  any  term  of imprisonment for any  crime  or\r\n\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken the Government some time to decide\r\n\r\nhow  to  modify these provisions to apply them  to\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Pensions   under   the   different\r\n\r\ncircumstances for Members of Parliament, Political\r\n\r\nSecretaries, Parliamentary Secretaries,  Ministers\r\n\r\nof  State  and  Ministers. The Government  decided\r\n\r\nthat  to  withhold part of an MP's  or  Minister's\r\n\r\npension   for  any  negligence,  irregularity   or\r\n\r\nmisconduct  was not practical. It  would  have  to\r\n\r\nfollow the findings of a disciplinary committee of\r\n\r\nfellow-Ministers and MPs. Nor was  it  appropriate\r\n\r\nsince the careers and responsibilities of MPs  and\r\n\r\nMinisters  were  different from  those  of  public\r\n\r\nofficers. Nor does imprisonment for any  crime  or\r\n\r\noffence   unconnected   with   parliamentary    or\r\n\r\nministerial  duties appear valid  ground  for  the\r\n\r\nwithholding of pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there can be no question that if any\r\n\r\nMinister,   Minister   of   State,   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,  Political Secretary  or  MP  has  been\r\n\r\nconvicted under the Prevention of Corruption  Act,\r\n\r\nor  of  any  crime involving corruption under  any\r\n\r\nother  written law, even if he has only been fined\r\n\r\nand   not  imprisoned,  then  this  warrants   the\r\n\r\nwithholding  of the pension.

For these purposes the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Law and National Development set up\r\n\r\nthe Parks and Recreation Division in the Public\r\n\r\nWorks Department. The powers which are vested in\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner for parks and Recreation are at\r\n\r\nthe moment found in several pieces of legislation,\r\n\r\nnamely, the Trees and Plants (Preservation and\r\n\r\nImprovement of Amenities) Act, 1970, (Act 59 of\r\n\r\n1970), the Botanic Gardens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct   (Chapter  300)  and  Part  V  of  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Integration Act (Chapter 210).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it has been found necessary to amend the\r\n\r\nexisting  legislation to vest in the  Commissioner\r\n\r\nnew  powers to enable him to carry out  his  work,\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity has been taken to revise all  the\r\n\r\nvarious legislation pertaining to parks and trees.\r\n\r\nThis   Bill,   therefore,  seeks  to   amend   and\r\n\r\nconsolidate the law which is found in the  various\r\n\r\nActs which I have referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main changes which will be made to the\r\n\r\nexisting legislation are as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A restriction will be imposed on the felling\r\n\r\nor cutting of any tree on any vacant land with a\r\n\r\ngirth exceeding one metre (3 ft. 4 ins.) measured\r\n\r\nhalf a metre (1 ft. 8 ins.) from the ground. Under\r\n\r\nthe existing provision of section 4 of the Trees\r\n\r\nand Plants (Preservation and Improvement of the\r\n\r\nAmenities) Act, 1970, this restriction applies to\r\n\r\ntrees with a girth exceeding five feet, measured\r\n\r\ntwo feet from the ground. Vacant land is defined\r\n\r\nin clause 2 of the Bill to refer to land which has\r\n\r\nnot been developed for residential or industrial\r\n\r\npurposes. This change has been proposed after a\r\n\r\nstudy was made by my Ministry's officers of the\r\n\r\nsizes of the different types of trees found in\r\n\r\nSingapore at their various stages of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Clause 5 of the Bill introduces a presumption\r\n\r\nthat where a tree is felled on any vacant land  it\r\n\r\nshall  be presumed that it has been felled by  the\r\n\r\nowner  or occupier of the land. This provision  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  in order not to frustrate the  work  of\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In clause 7 the Commissioner is given the\r\n\r\npower to serve a notice on the occupier of any\r\n\r\nvacant land or land on which a new street is to be\r\n\r\nconstructed to require the occupier to  plant\r\n\r\ntrees. Further, the Commissioner is empowered\r\n\r\nunder clause 11 to require housing developers to\r\n\r\nmake a deposit to ensure that trees are planted\r\n\r\nand open spaces made up in accordance with the\r\n\r\napproved plans and specifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nBill,  the  purpose  of which is  to  promote  the\r\n\r\nplanting  and protection of trees and  flowers  in\r\n\r\norder  to  make Singapore a garden city. Over  the\r\n\r\npast few years the Government has observed one day\r\n\r\nin the year as the national \"Tree Planting Day\" to\r\n\r\nencourage people to plant more trees and shrubs in\r\n\r\norder  to beautify our environment in the  concept\r\n\r\nof a Garden City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people in my constituency have been\r\n\r\nsupporting  this  campaign every  year.  On  \"Tree\r\n\r\nPlanting  Day\"  hundreds of  people  of  different\r\n\r\nraces  would turn up voluntarily to take  part  in\r\n\r\ntree  planting.  Thus  they have  not  only  shown\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  in  their support of the  annual  Tree\r\n\r\nPlanting  Day, but they have also in  their  daily\r\n\r\nlife  been  actively  promoting  this  concept  by\r\n\r\nplanting  trees and shrubs on empty  plots  around\r\n\r\ntheir  shophouses or houses to beautify and uplift\r\n\r\nthe environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parks and Recreation Division under the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development has contributed a\r\n\r\nlot towards achieving the objective of beautifying\r\n\r\nour environment. For instance, the stretch of land\r\n\r\nalong the east coast from Tanjong Rhu to Bedok  is\r\n\r\nbeing  developed into a public seaside park.  This\r\n\r\nis  being  developed  into a  first  class  public\r\n\r\nresort   of   international  standard   even   for\r\n\r\ntourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as regards tree planting at other places\r\n\r\nthere  are  certain  shortcomings.  For  instance,\r\n\r\nalong  Bras Basah Road and Robinson Road  the  PWD\r\n\r\nhas  planted  trees along that side  of  the  road\r\n\r\nwhich  originally was a pedestrian walk.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  not  quite right because the  roads  are\r\n\r\nalready  quite narrow and in view of  the  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion along these roads, the demand for  road\r\n\r\nspace  is  very urgent. So it would be proper  for\r\n\r\nthe  PWD  to  widen the roads instead of  planting\r\n\r\ntrees  along the sides, which worsens the  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion.  Planting  trees  at  random   without\r\n\r\nproper or advance planning is a sheer waste of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic money because tree planting costs a lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney.  One tree can cost several hundred  dollars\r\n\r\nif  a contractor were to do it. This is a waste of\r\n\r\npublic funds and is not justified. So I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  give careful  consideration  in\r\n\r\nadvance before planting any more trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter relates to a strange complaint\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have  received. This is the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nprivate landowner who wanted to develop his  land,\r\n\r\nbut  there  stood  in the way a big  tree  several\r\n\r\ndecades  old. The developer applied for permission\r\n\r\nto  cut  it  down. The authorities concerned  said\r\n\r\nthat the tree could not be cut down because it  is\r\n\r\nunder  the  protection of the law.  The  landowner\r\n\r\nfeels  that there is no reason for the authorities\r\n\r\nto  deny  him  permission to fell the  tree  which\r\n\r\nstands  in his own private land. I therefore  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister will look into this  complaint\r\n\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with reference to clause 5 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, I just want to make a brief observation\r\n\r\non   a   matter   therein  and  perhaps   seek   a\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister. In clause 5 there\r\n\r\nis an exception made for the felling or cutting of\r\n\r\ntrees,  i.e, the prevention of imminent danger.  I\r\n\r\ntake   it  that  \"imminent  danger\"  in  the  Bill\r\n\r\ncontemplates imminent danger to human life.  Would\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  clarify  as  to  whether  the  term\r\n\r\n\"imminent   danger\"  also  contemplates   imminent\r\n\r\ndanger  to  property and animals,  like  pigs  and\r\n\r\npets, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Lim Guan Hoo)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I wonder if the Member for Sembawang would\r\n\r\ncare to clarify this point.

He  should  have  taken  the  opportunity\r\n\r\nduring the last few days in Committee of Supply to\r\n\r\ngrumble about trees planted in the wrong places or\r\n\r\nnarrowing down roads. But he has made one relevant\r\n\r\nobservation, and that is, about one big tree on  a\r\n\r\npiece  of  vacant  land  which  is  about  to   be\r\n\r\ndeveloped. The position is this. Where  a  housing\r\n\r\ndeveloper  applies to build on vacant  land  which\r\n\r\nmay  have  beautiful trees there in existence  for\r\n\r\nmore  than 50 or even 100 years, we send  officers\r\n\r\nto  the  vacant land to mark out where  the  trees\r\n\r\nare,  and the developer is still allowed to  build\r\n\r\nprovided he preserves some trees. We are not  here\r\n\r\nto  protect  all the trees nor to stifle  building\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  We would allow developers  to  build\r\n\r\nprovided sufficient trees are preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not follow the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens   who  wanted  clarification,  unless   it\r\n\r\nappears in clause 10 which states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where the Commissioner is satisfied that any\r\n\r\ntree  or plant, whether growing or not, is  in  an\r\n\r\ninflammable state or is likely to be dangerous  to\r\n\r\nlife or property or to cause an obstruction . .  .\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner may by notice in writing require\r\n\r\nthe occupier of the land on which it is growing or\r\n\r\nlying to remove it within a time specified in  the\r\n\r\nnotice.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not propose to prevent all trees being\r\n\r\nfelled  or  cut down. `There must be a  few  trees\r\n\r\nwhich  are  about to fall down either  because  of\r\n\r\nroot  trouble or some other disease to the  trunk.\r\n\r\nWhere a tree is likely to fall anti is a danger to\r\n\r\nlife and/or property, permission can be sought for\r\n\r\nit to be cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like the Minister to clarify certain\r\n\r\npoints.

However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  point out some of  the  practical\r\n\r\nproblems which may arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As spelt out in clauses 11 to 14, the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Parks and Recreation is  empowered\r\n\r\nto  take  a  deposit from the developer to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  he plants trees and lays out the open spaces\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with the plans and  specifications\r\n\r\napproved  by the competent authority.  More  often\r\n\r\nthan  not, Sir, the developer has no intention  of\r\n\r\nretaining ownership long after a project has  been\r\n\r\ncompleted.  He  sells  the  property  to   various\r\n\r\nbuyers,  and  sometimes there are  differences  of\r\n\r\nopinion  as  to  what  types of  trees  should  be\r\n\r\nplanted.  Surely, the buyer should have a  say  in\r\n\r\nthe  type of trees to be planted in front  of  his\r\n\r\nhouse  or the type of hedges to be planted  around\r\n\r\nhis fencing and compound. I wonder if the Minister\r\n\r\nwould  agree  that  some  flexibility  should   be\r\n\r\nallowed in instances like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, Sir, we have looked into this matter. Clause\r\n\r\n11,  for  instance, was brought in for a  specific\r\n\r\nreason.   Previously   some   developers,    after\r\n\r\nobtaining subdivision of the land and planning and\r\n\r\nbuilding  approval  from the competent  authority,\r\n\r\nwould just sell the houses and leave the roads  in\r\n\r\na  very bad state. As the Member has pointed  out,\r\n\r\ndevelopers want to sell. So they sell all the lots\r\n\r\nand  then  disappear; leaving the roads  not  even\r\n\r\nproperly   constructed   nor   the   road   lights\r\n\r\ninstalled. This is the sort of situation  we  want\r\n\r\nto   prevent.  Hence,  this  provision   that   on\r\n\r\napplication  for  building  approval  one  of  the\r\n\r\nconditions  imposed is that the  developer  plants\r\n\r\ncertain  trees. We cannot allow them to  sell  the\r\n\r\nland after development and then disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as the type of trees which the\r\n\r\ndeveloper   or  his  purchaser  may  prefer,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner is really not rigid. They can  choose\r\n\r\nthe type of trees and we can make recommendations.\r\n\r\nAll  we want to ensure is that the person who gets\r\n\r\nthe approval does something to plant in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  plans which he has obtained. Hence  the\r\n\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr E.

The Bill seeks to amend the Trustees\r\n\r\nAct (Chapter 40) by increasing the borrowing power\r\n\r\nof an \"approved company\" from two-thirds to three-quarters of its mortgaged assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 3 and 4 of the Act lay down the\r\n\r\nprerequisites  that  must be complied  with  by  a\r\n\r\ncompany  before  it can obtain the  status  of  an\r\n\r\n\"approved company\" within the meaning of the  Act.\r\n\r\nAn \"approved company\" is defined in the Act as one\r\n\r\nthat is incorporated in Singapore and which has  a\r\n\r\nplace of business in Singapore, having as its sole\r\n\r\nor  primary object the promotion of home ownership\r\n\r\nby   advancing   purchase  monies,  repayable   by\r\n\r\ninstalments over a specified period of time.  Such\r\n\r\nan  \"approved company\" would then be permitted  to\r\n\r\nseek   loans  from  trustees  in  accordance  with\r\n\r\nsection  4 (1) (e) of the Trustees Act. Section  4\r\n\r\n(2)  of the Act, however, lays down the conditions\r\n\r\nunder  which trust funds may be invested  with  an\r\n\r\n\"approved company\". One of the conditions is  that\r\n\r\nthe   total   borrowing  power  of  the  \"approved\r\n\r\ncompany\"  must  not  exceed  two-thirds   of   its\r\n\r\nmortgaged assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have been received for an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  an borrowing power of  an  \"approved\r\n\r\ncompany\"  from  two-thirds to four-fifths  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany's mortgaged assets as the present limit is\r\n\r\nconsidered too restrictive. Consideration has been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  these representations. It is,  however,\r\n\r\nfelt  that the limit imposed by the Act should  be\r\n\r\nraised  from two-thirds to three-quarters  instead\r\n\r\nof  four-fifths  of  the  mortgaged  assets.  This\r\n\r\nrequires  an amendment to the relevant section  of\r\n\r\nthe  Trustees  Act;  hence the  Bill  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr E.

And because of this tremendous appetite\r\n\r\nfor  drugs, a vast pharmaceutical industry  exists\r\n\r\ntoday.  In Singapore the total value of  trade  in\r\n\r\npharmaceutical products in 1973 was $170  million.\r\n\r\nFor the four years 1969-1973, imports increased by\r\n\r\nover 80% while exports increased by 400%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In earlier times, medicines were of simpler\r\n\r\nchemical substances or derivatives of herbs.  They\r\n\r\nwere  consumed in the form of powders prepared  by\r\n\r\npounding  or  in  the form of liquid  obtained  by\r\n\r\nbrewing    the    medicinal   preparations.    The\r\n\r\nadvancement of science has made it possible for us\r\n\r\nto  extract  the  active  ingredients  from  these\r\n\r\nmedicinal preparations, synthesising them and even\r\n\r\nmodifying  their  structures  to  make  them  more\r\n\r\npotent and specific. In these forms they are  then\r\n\r\nmade  available  to the public in  elegant  pills,\r\n\r\ncapsules, injectionables and suppositories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even preparations used as home remedies in the\r\n\r\ntraditional  systems  of  treating  ailments  have\r\n\r\nchanged  beyond  recognition. No  longer  do  they\r\n\r\nconic  only  as dried parts of plants or  animals;\r\n\r\nthey  are  now  sold  in  powder  form  or  liquid\r\n\r\nextracts  and some of them have been found  to  be\r\n\r\nmixed  with  dangerous substances making  them  no\r\n\r\nlonger harmless remedies but potent poisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing bewildering array of medicines of\r\n\r\nhigh  potency  and  diverse  effects  has  created\r\n\r\ncertain  problems of control. Whilst  on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand  the public needs to be protected and assured\r\n\r\nthat the medicines that are available are safe and\r\n\r\nuseful;  on the other hand, those who are  in  the\r\n\r\npharmaceutical  industry  should  not  be   unduly\r\n\r\ndiscouraged  from introducing new and more  useful\r\n\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing controls are no longer adequate in\r\n\r\ndealing with a pharmaceutical trade that has grown\r\n\r\ntremendously   and  a  situation   where   complex\r\n\r\nchemicals with far-reaching effects on the human\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing now form the bulk of medicines available  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Medicines Act is an omnibus act\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  bring together controls  which  were\r\n\r\nformerly  exercised under various  separate  Acts.\r\n\r\nMost of the provisions of the Poisons Act will now\r\n\r\nbe  incorporated into the Medicines  Act.  Only  a\r\n\r\nresidual  portion  on  the control  of  industrial\r\n\r\npoison   will  remain.  The  Medicines  Act   will\r\n\r\nsupersede  the Sale of Drugs Act and the Medicines\r\n\r\n(Advertisement and Sale) Act, both of  which  will\r\n\r\nbe  repealed.  As the control of opium  and  other\r\n\r\nsimilar narcotic drugs is subject to international\r\n\r\nconventions   because  of  international   illegal\r\n\r\ntrafficking, special controls will continue to  be\r\n\r\nexercised under the Misuse of Drugs Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of the Medicines Act is to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  persons who use drugs, that  is  the\r\n\r\ncustomers who, by and large, have no knowledge  of\r\n\r\nfactors influencing the safety and usefulness of a\r\n\r\nmedicine.  The Act is to ensure that the  medicine\r\n\r\nwhich a consumer obtains is safe and useful and of\r\n\r\na  quality he should expect. Since he is generally\r\n\r\nnot  knowledgeable in this matter,  the  influence\r\n\r\nbrought to bear on him through advertisements must\r\n\r\nbe  fair. The drug he obtains, be it from a doctor\r\n\r\nwho  prescribes it or bought over the counter from\r\n\r\na   medicine  shop,  should  comply  with  certain\r\n\r\nquality  and safety standards. Conversely, neither\r\n\r\nshould he have access to drugs for which he has no\r\n\r\nneed of; nor should he consume drugs which he  has\r\n\r\nno knowledge of their potency or safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, all medicinal products will come\r\n\r\nunder strict scrutiny. Medicinal products prepared\r\n\r\nfrom  herbs,  animals or insects which  have  been\r\n\r\nused  in  traditional systems of treating ailments\r\n\r\nand  which  were largely not controlled previously\r\n\r\nwill now be subject to similar scrutiny under  the\r\n\r\nlaw.  This is essential. These products  are  more\r\n\r\noften than not supplied as pills and potions where\r\n\r\nthe original herb or animal part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  no longer recognisable. It has been discovered\r\n\r\nthat  unscrupulous  manufacturers  and  charlatans\r\n\r\nhave  resorted  to adding highly  active  chemical\r\n\r\nsubstances  to  lend  potency to  their  medicine.\r\n\r\nArsenic   discovered   in   several   brands    of\r\n\r\npreparations  used  widely  in  the  treatment  of\r\n\r\nasthma is an example. Potent hydrocortisones  have\r\n\r\nbeen  found in others and so too have mercury  and\r\n\r\nlead.  We  can no longer ignore the large  numbers\r\n\r\nand   brands   of  medicinals  which  are   freely\r\n\r\navailable in the market, nor can we rightly assume\r\n\r\nthat  they are harmless. More often than not  they\r\n\r\nare  mixed  with  poisons and  arc  compounded  by\r\n\r\npersons  with  no knowledge of basic  pharmacy  or\r\n\r\npharmacology and distributed by persons whose sole\r\n\r\ninterest  is  profit.  Even  cosmetics  which  may\r\n\r\ncontain harmful or deleterious substances can also\r\n\r\nbe brought under the purview of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest method of achieving the objective of\r\n\r\nprotecting the public in regard to medicines is to\r\n\r\nimpose  a ban on advertisements of medicines  anti\r\n\r\ncouple  this  with  a complete  control  over  the\r\n\r\ndealing  in  medicines by only allowing  sales  by\r\n\r\nprescription   and  restricting  the   import   or\r\n\r\nmanufacture of medicines to a few types of brands.\r\n\r\nIn  fact  such  controls  are  practised  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries.    Such   a   measure   would    reduce\r\n\r\nconsiderably  the expenditure on  drugs  and  drug\r\n\r\ncontrol.  It  would  eliminate  malpractices   and\r\n\r\nunscrupulous dealings in drugs. However, we cannot\r\n\r\nadopt  this  simplistic  attitude  as  we  are  an\r\n\r\nimportant  centre  of  communications  and  trade.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  we  must exercise certain  controls\r\n\r\nand   restrictions  while  permitting   legitimate\r\n\r\npharmaceutical trade without compromising  on  the\r\n\r\nefficacy  and  quality of medicines  available  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This Act attempts to do just that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act accordingly provides close control at all\r\n\r\nlevels  of  the pharmaceutical trade  -  from  the\r\n\r\nimport  and  manufacture of drugs to the  sale  of\r\n\r\ndrugs  and  even  to the dispensing  of  drugs  by\r\n\r\npractitioners and pharmacists. Strict  regulations\r\n\r\nwill be aimed at ensuring public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsafety. This is paramount. Further, in view of the\r\n\r\ngeneral   ignorance  about  medicine   there   are\r\n\r\ncontrols  over advertisements and other techniques\r\n\r\nfor   promoting  drug  sales  since  doctors   and\r\n\r\npatients are normally not in a position to  verify\r\n\r\nthe claims of manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act lays down in considerable detail the\r\n\r\nauthority and the principles of control while  the\r\n\r\nprocedures for implementation will be set  out  in\r\n\r\nthe regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic instrument to effect the objectives\r\n\r\nwill  be  the product licence. Any persons wishing\r\n\r\nto  import  or manufacture any medicinal  products\r\n\r\nwill  have to satisfy the licensing authority  who\r\n\r\nis  the  Director  of Medical  Services  that  the\r\n\r\nproduct  complies with certain quality  standards.\r\n\r\nMedicinal  products will be classified  under  two\r\n\r\ncategories,  (a) non-general sales list  medicines\r\n\r\nand   (b)  general  sales  list  medicines.   Only\r\n\r\nqualified   persons,   i.e, doctors,   dentists,\r\n\r\npharmacists and veterinary surgeons, may deal with\r\n\r\nnon-general sales list products. Medicines on  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  sales list which are relatively  harmless\r\n\r\nwill be subject to less stringent control and  may\r\n\r\nbe  sold  as it is now being sold in our  medicine\r\n\r\nshops,   over   the   counter   and   without    a\r\n\r\nprescription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicinal products will now be screened by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  before they appear on the local  market.\r\n\r\nWhere  necessary, the screening will  be  done  by\r\n\r\nadvisory  committees. The evidence that is  to  be\r\n\r\nprovided by applicants for a product licence  will\r\n\r\ninclude  details  of pharmaceutical,  bio-chemical\r\n\r\nand  chemical formulation, conditions and locality\r\n\r\nof   manufacture,  details  of  qualified   person\r\n\r\nsupervising its manufacture, and results of trials\r\n\r\ncarried out, and whether it complies with the laws\r\n\r\nof  the  country  of manufacture if  this  is  not\r\n\r\nmanufactured  locally. It shall be an  offence  to\r\n\r\nmisrepresent any of these facts and the  licensing\r\n\r\nauthority  is  authorised to refuse  to  grant  or\r\n\r\nrevoke  a  licence  and vary any  or  all  of  the\r\n\r\nconditions upon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   the  product  licence  has  been  granted.\r\n\r\nPenalties  are provided for those who  breach  the\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturers of medicinal products will be\r\n\r\nrequired  to apply for licences.

The issuance of such a licence will  be\r\n\r\ntied to amongst other requirements suitability  of\r\n\r\npremises  as  well as the employment of  qualified\r\n\r\npersonnel. Their premises will have to be adequate\r\n\r\nwith  suitable storage and distributing space  and\r\n\r\nequipment.

Adequate  records  are\r\n\r\nrequired also to facilitate easy recall of drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also protects the purchaser from\r\n\r\nfraudulent representation on the safety,  efficacy\r\n\r\nand   quality  of  medicinal  products.

Thus one of the first parts to be\r\n\r\nimplemented   will  be  the  notice   categorising\r\n\r\nmedicines  on  a  general sales list  and  a  non-general  sales  list.  The  next  would   be   the\r\n\r\nregulations  on registration of all medicines  and\r\n\r\nmedicinal products.

We will also  rely  on\r\n\r\nthe independent reports published regularly by the\r\n\r\nWorld   Health  Organisation  and  internationally\r\n\r\nrenowned  research  centres  for  making  rational\r\n\r\njudgments on the safety and efficacy of particular\r\n\r\ndrugs and their use in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To administer the law will require a large\r\n\r\nexpansion   of   the  section   of   the   Poisons\r\n\r\nInspectorate  of  the  Ministry  of  Health.  This\r\n\r\nsection will be responsible for the keeping of the\r\n\r\nregisters,  issue  of  licences  and  inspections.\r\n\r\nThere  are provisions in the law for the  Minister\r\n\r\nto appoint committees. Perhaps the one which would\r\n\r\nbe of more immediate interest would be a Committee\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  appeals  against  decisions  taken\r\n\r\nadministratively   on  licensing.   Other   expert\r\n\r\ncommittees  such as a committee on safety  may  be\r\n\r\nintroduced in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the complexity of the Act and its far-reaching controls which will affect the fabric of\r\n\r\nmedical practice and the pharmaceutical trade,  it\r\n\r\nis  recommended  that the Bill be committed  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, arising from an oral question\r\n\r\nwhich  I  asked the Minister of State  for  Health\r\n\r\nsometime last year, I am glad to note that he  has\r\n\r\nkept his promise by referring the Bill to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to give some general\r\n\r\nobservations why this Medicines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill  should  be  sent to a Select Committee.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  of State has correctly brought  out  the\r\n\r\npoint  which I intended to raise, and that is,  it\r\n\r\nappears  extremely restrictive that an  appeal  is\r\n\r\ndecided  by  the Minister alone. I  think  he  has\r\n\r\nindicated just now that it would be better that an\r\n\r\nappeal   committee  consisting  of   knowledgeable\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from the relevant  authorities  be\r\n\r\nappointed  to  assess all appeals  and  makes  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  to  the  Minister  for  a   final\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part II, clause 10 (3) the definition of\r\n\r\n\"product  licence\" is not clear for  it  does  not\r\n\r\npositively  say whether it is the brand  or  trade\r\n\r\nname  or  whether  it is the chemical  or  generic\r\n\r\nname.  Therefore,  the question of  issuing  third\r\n\r\nparty   licence   on  patented  products   becomes\r\n\r\nrelevant. It is reasonable to accept that products\r\n\r\nwith  patent  protection  still  in  force,  third\r\n\r\nparties  should not be allowed to  apply  for  the\r\n\r\nlicence.  However,  product  licence  holders  can\r\n\r\nassign the right to a third party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few medicinal authorities in the United States\r\n\r\nhave  questioned the adequacy of the United States\r\n\r\nPharmacopoeia (USP) standards. As with the British\r\n\r\nPharmacopoeia  (BP) or the European  Pharmacopoeia\r\n\r\n(EP) bio-availability standards are generally  not\r\n\r\navailable.  Hence  in clause 12  (1),  the  safety\r\n\r\nefficacy and quality of medicinal products  should\r\n\r\nbe thoroughly reexamined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 (a), (b) and (c) allows the Minister to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations  for  clinical  trials  and  for\r\n\r\nmedicinal  tests. It is recognised  that  we  have\r\n\r\nlimited  clinical  and testing facilities.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  unlikely that we are in a  position  to\r\n\r\nconduct   tests   on   tetratogenic   effects   or\r\n\r\ncongenital  deformities.  In  view  of  this,  the\r\n\r\nlicensing   authority  should   be   flexible   in\r\n\r\nassessing   submitted  literature  for   medicinal\r\n\r\nproducts. An example of this test in case  is  the\r\n\r\nexperience   relating  to  the   introduction   of\r\n\r\nthalidomide  in Germany resulting in thousands  of\r\n\r\nbabies  being deformed. It is therefore  essential\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablish  whether local manufacturing  facilities\r\n\r\nprovide  certain  safeguards on the  consumers  in\r\n\r\ncase  of  such an unfortunate event  for  if  they\r\n\r\nshould  seek  monetary compensation,  how  do  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers intend to meet these requirements? I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is  one area which is  worth  looking\r\n\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in Part III, clauses 34 and 35, and Part\r\n\r\nIV,  clauses  37  (3) and 41(1), these  provisions\r\n\r\nappear    to   discriminate   against   practising\r\n\r\npharmacists  or pharmacies. It appears  reasonable\r\n\r\nthat  these  similar  provisions  should  also  be\r\n\r\nextended  to  all  those handling  and  dispensing\r\n\r\nmedicinal products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V, clause 47 (1), this provision is not\r\n\r\npractical as most imported medicinal products  are\r\n\r\nalready  produced by multi-national pharmaceutical\r\n\r\ncorporations   for   the   international   market.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it may be difficult for the Minister to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations stipulating distinctive colours,\r\n\r\nshapes and markings of medicinal products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole of Part VI of the Bill deals with the\r\n\r\npromotion  of  sales  of  medicinal  products  and\r\n\r\nmedical  advertisements. This has  extremely  wide\r\n\r\nimplications    and   requires    closer    study.\r\n\r\nRepresentations  by interested  and  knowledgeable\r\n\r\nparties will be made to the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good intention of any Bill or Act will be\r\n\r\nthwarted  and cannot achieve its required  effects\r\n\r\nif  the implementation process is not as effective\r\n\r\nand    sensibly   carried   out.   Hence    proper\r\n\r\nconsideration  should be given to the  formulation\r\n\r\nof  various regulations by the licensing authority\r\n\r\nfor  the practical implementation of the Medicines\r\n\r\nAct, 1975, when it is finally passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ang Kok Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Member for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley for his views which will be conveyed\r\n\r\nto the Select Committee for consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Medicines Bill be committed to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and\r\n\r\nthe following Members:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n  Dr Ang Kok Peng\r\n\r\n  Mr Ivan Baptist\r\n\r\n  Mr Chan Chee Seng\r\n\r\n  Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon\r\n\r\n  Mr P.

Both Boards were established under\r\n\r\nauthority of separate laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first legislation on nurses known as the\r\n\r\nNurses Registration Ordinance came into effect  in\r\n\r\nFebruary,   1949,   and  a   Nursing   Board   was\r\n\r\nestablished to maintain a register of  nurses  and\r\n\r\nto regulate on the training and conduct of nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation for midwives was introduced very\r\n\r\nmuch  earlier. The Midwives Ordinance was  brought\r\n\r\ninto  effect in July, 1917. Amendments were passed\r\n\r\nsubsequently  in 1923 and 1924, and  in  1959  new\r\n\r\nregulations   were   incorporated.   Under    this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  a Midwives Board was established  with\r\n\r\nthe   function  of  maintaining  a  register   and\r\n\r\nregulating the training and conduct of midwives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times have changed. Midwifery has now become a\r\n\r\nsubject of study in the training of nurses. It  is\r\n\r\nalso  taken as a course in the post-basic  nursing\r\n\r\ntraining.  Furthermore, fewer people arc  choosing\r\n\r\nmidwifery  training solely. The sophistication  of\r\n\r\nour  population, increasing urbanisation  and  the\r\n\r\nextensive and comprehensive medical services  have\r\n\r\nreduced the demand for domiciliary midwifery. More\r\n\r\nthan  80% of all deliveries in Singapore  are  now\r\n\r\nundertaken in our Government medical institutions.\r\n\r\nThe  rest are delivered mainly in maternity homes.\r\n\r\nOnly  a  few are delivered by private midwives  at\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently midwifery should logically be\r\n\r\nregarded   as  another  branch  of  nursing,   the\r\n\r\nseparate  law on midwifery be abolished,  and  the\r\n\r\nactivities  in regard to nursing and midwifery  be\r\n\r\nput  under the jurisdiction of a single board  The\r\n\r\nSingapore Nursing Board. This Board will supersede\r\n\r\nthe   Nursing   and  the  Midwives   Boards.   The\r\n\r\nconsolidation of the two professions and  services\r\n\r\nwill also lead to administrative convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, however, does not mean that midwives will\r\n\r\nplay  a  role  secondary to that  of  the  nurses,\r\n\r\nneither  does it suggest that midwifery is  to  be\r\n\r\ngoverned  by a nursing body. On the contrary,  the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the Board allows for both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmidwives and nurses to be represented. In addition\r\n\r\nto  the  traditional  role of midwives  which  was\r\n\r\nconfined  in the main to the delivering of  babies\r\n\r\nand  giving  advice  to mothers  on  the  care  of\r\n\r\nchildren,  the  midwives  nowadays  also  have  an\r\n\r\nimportant  role  to  play in  family  planning  by\r\n\r\ngiving counsel to parents on the need for planning\r\n\r\na small family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Nursing Board will be responsible\r\n\r\nfor  ensuring that nurses and midwives who are  to\r\n\r\nbe  emplaced  on  the register or roll  have  been\r\n\r\nadequately trained in accordance with the  courses\r\n\r\nand examinations conducted by the Board. The Board\r\n\r\nshall   also   have  powers  to   determine   what\r\n\r\nqualifications are necessary for anyone seeking to\r\n\r\nbe  emplaced on its register or roll. In short, it\r\n\r\nwill  oversee, maintain and improve the  standards\r\n\r\nof practice and conduct of nurses and midwives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is empowered also to impose punitive\r\n\r\nmeasures   on  those  who  choose  to  bring   the\r\n\r\nprofessions to disrepute. Accordingly the Board is\r\n\r\nempowered to remove the names of such persons from\r\n\r\nthe  register  or roll or impose as  it  sees  fit\r\n\r\nlesser penalties such as cautioning, censuring  or\r\n\r\nsuspending persons for adverse practice. The Board\r\n\r\nis  also  empowered where it deems fit to  restore\r\n\r\nnames   of  persons  to  the  register  or   roll.\r\n\r\nAggrieved  persons are allowed to  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A registrar of the Board is to be appointed and\r\n\r\nhe  shall  be responsible for the preparation  and\r\n\r\nmaintenance of the register and roll  and  act  as\r\n\r\nsecretary to the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act also prevents unqualified persons from\r\n\r\ntaking the titles of nurse or midwife so that  the\r\n\r\npublic  will not be misled.

An\r\n\r\nannouncement  on this will be made very  shortly.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the  current  uncertainty   in   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  world,  the introduction  of  NCDs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  been delayed but I  am  confident\r\n\r\nthat   eventually  NCDs  will  be  an  instrument\r\n\r\ncommonly traded in the Singapore money market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our desire to consolidate the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore as a maritime centre, it\r\n\r\nhas been our policy to give fiscal incentives  to\r\n\r\nencourage shipowners to register their  ships  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  announced  previously   that   the\r\n\r\nbalancing charge which may arise on the sale of a\r\n\r\nSingapore  ship will not be subject  to  tax  and\r\n\r\nthat there will be income tax exemption for crews\r\n\r\nworking  on  board  Singapore  registered  ships.\r\n\r\nClauses  3  (a)  and  4  (a)  provide  for  these\r\n\r\nconcessions.  In addition, I am proposing  a  new\r\n\r\nconcession  under  clause 5.  Hitherto,  although\r\n\r\nincome from a Singapore ship is exempt from  tax,\r\n\r\ndepreciation  allowances on the  ship  are  still\r\n\r\nrequired to be charged against the exempt income.\r\n\r\nThe  effect is to reduce the amount of tax exempt\r\n\r\ndividends  that  could  be declared  by  shipping\r\n\r\ncompanies. I propose to lift this requirement and\r\n\r\nallow Singapore ships the option to claim or  not\r\n\r\nto claim depreciation allowances. However, should\r\n\r\na  ship  leave the Singapore registry and  become\r\n\r\nliable  to  Singapore income tax,  any  unclaimed\r\n\r\ndepreciation  allowances accumulated  during  the\r\n\r\nperiod of its Singapore registration will not  be\r\n\r\nallowed.  At  the same time, it is also  proposed\r\n\r\nthat tax exempt shipping income be separated from\r\n\r\nother  taxable  income  or  losses  of  the  same\r\n\r\ncompany. In the past, shipping losses may be used\r\n\r\nto  offset  against non-shipping  taxable  income\r\n\r\nwhich is undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 is also concerned with depreciation\r\n\r\nallowances    and   provides   for    accelerated\r\n\r\ndepreciation over three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  on  capital  investment in  antipollution\r\n\r\ndevices.  This  concession  is  in  keeping  with\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  to promote  a  cleaner  and\r\n\r\nhealthier atmosphere in industrial estates and in\r\n\r\nthe community as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The export of our manufactured goods is the\r\n\r\nbasis of our industrial strategy. I am pleased to\r\n\r\nsee   the  number  of  trade  missions  organised\r\n\r\nrecently  to  visit  potential  markets  to  push\r\n\r\nexports of Singapore-made goods. To assist  these\r\n\r\nefforts  in  export promotion, I  announced  that\r\n\r\ndouble  deduction  will be allowed  for  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred   in  approved  overseas  trade   fairs,\r\n\r\nexhibitions   or  trade  missions  organised   to\r\n\r\npromote  the  exports  of  Singapore-manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods.  This concession, however, will not  apply\r\n\r\nto  enterprises which are already enjoying export\r\n\r\nor  other incentives under the Economic Expansion\r\n\r\nIncentives Act. Clause 6 of the Bill provides for\r\n\r\nthe  double deduction concession which will  have\r\n\r\nretrospective effect from 1st April, 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the amendments in the Bill\r\n\r\ndesigned  to tighten the law against  income  tax\r\n\r\noffenders.  Income  tax is the  mainstay  of  our\r\n\r\nrevenue  structure accounting for more than  one-third  of  total revenue. Compliance by taxpayers\r\n\r\nis   therefore   of  paramount   importance   and\r\n\r\nGovernment  must see to it that every person  who\r\n\r\nis liable pays his fair share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of a penalty system for tax evasion\r\n\r\nwhich  without excessive harshness would  yet  be\r\n\r\npunitive enough to deter would-be offenders is no\r\n\r\neasy   task.   Some  guidance  is   provided   by\r\n\r\nexperience  in  the day-to-day administration  of\r\n\r\nthe  law.  And  such experience  has  shown  that\r\n\r\ncertain  modifications in the  law  dealing  with\r\n\r\noffenders should be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill provides for modification\r\n\r\nof  the penalty for failure to make an income tax\r\n\r\nreturn  or  furnish particulars. There have  been\r\n\r\ntoo  many  cases where a fourth, fifth  or  sixth\r\n\r\nconviction  has  not had the  desired  effect  of\r\n\r\ngetting the taxpayer to submit his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreturns  or  accounts. The present  penalty  of  a\r\n\r\nmaximum fine of $1,000 appears ineffective. It  is\r\n\r\nnow proposed that if the conviction is a second or\r\n\r\nsubsequent conviction relating to the same year of\r\n\r\nassessment, the taxpayer shall be made to suffer a\r\n\r\nfurther  penalty of $50 a day for every  day  that\r\n\r\nthe offence is continued after conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to remove the requirement of\r\n\r\na  possible minimum of six months' imprisonment in\r\n\r\naddition to a fine for taxpayers who are convicted\r\n\r\nfor  omitting  or  making  false  returns  without\r\n\r\nreasonable excuse or through fraud. A minimum  six\r\n\r\nmonths' imprisonment seems too harsh in this  case\r\n\r\nand invariably this has led to offenders being let\r\n\r\noff  with  only a fine. Clauses 14 and 15  of  the\r\n\r\nBill will allow for the length of imprisonment  to\r\n\r\nhe  decided  by the Court. However, for  cases  of\r\n\r\nfraudulent  evasion for more than three  years,  a\r\n\r\nminimum six months' sentence will remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, only the High Court may impose the\r\n\r\nfull  penalty  in  respect of offences  under  the\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax  Act. As a good number of  income  tax\r\n\r\ncases   are   dealt  with  in  the   District   or\r\n\r\nMagistrate's  Court, clause 16  will  empower  the\r\n\r\nDistrict or Magistrate's Court to impose the  full\r\n\r\npenalty as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 will require a married woman to sign\r\n\r\nand   furnish  a  return  in  respect  of   income\r\n\r\nassessable  in  her  husband's  name,  if   deemed\r\n\r\nnecessary  by the Comptroller. This will  make  it\r\n\r\npossible  for  the  Comptroller  to  take   action\r\n\r\nagainst the wife where she derives unearned income\r\n\r\nwhich is assessable only in her husband's name and\r\n\r\nwhich  has  not been declared to the  Comptroller.\r\n\r\nHitherto,  it  was not possible to  prosecute  the\r\n\r\nhusband since he may genuinely be unaware  of  the\r\n\r\nwife's  undeclared income. At the time it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to prosecute the wife since she  is  not\r\n\r\nassessable on this income. The amendment will plug\r\n\r\nthis loophole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, provisions in the Income Tax Act\r\n\r\nregarding the general secrecy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  income  tax matters prevented the  Comptroller\r\n\r\nfrom  making a complaint to any Professional  Body\r\n\r\neven  if  he  is  aware of blatant  unprofessional\r\n\r\npractices. This is an obstruction to the course of\r\n\r\njustice. Clause 2 will take out this fetter on the\r\n\r\nComptroller  to allow him to make a  complaint  to\r\n\r\nthe  appropriate Professional Body of professional\r\n\r\nmisconduct  against a person in  his  professional\r\n\r\ndealings with the Comptroller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to those amendments which are\r\n\r\nintended  to  streamline  procedures  and  improve\r\n\r\nexisting legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 will restrict the double child relief\r\n\r\ngiven  to  taxpayers whose children  are  studying\r\n\r\nabroad. It has been found that a number of parents\r\n\r\nwant  their  children  to be \"expatriates\"  at  an\r\n\r\nearly  age  by  sending them to  expensive  school\r\n\r\nabroad.  In  the  past,  double  relief  could  be\r\n\r\nclaimed  for  these children but  there  seems  no\r\n\r\nreason  why Government should continue  to  doubly\r\n\r\nsubsidize such unnecessary expenditure. Clause  18\r\n\r\ntherefore provides that double relief will only he\r\n\r\nallowed  where the course of study abroad  pursued\r\n\r\nby  the child is either not available in Singapore\r\n\r\nor  the  child is unable to gain admission  to  an\r\n\r\ninstitution of higher learning in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income of public entertainers is exempted from\r\n\r\ntax  if  their  visits are supported  from  public\r\n\r\nfunds  of  foreign  governments.  Sometimes,   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  support  from  foreign  governments  is\r\n\r\npurely  nominal. Clause 4 (b) proposes to make  it\r\n\r\nclear that exemption will apply only if the visits\r\n\r\nof public entertainers are substantially supported\r\n\r\nfrom public funds of foreign governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To simplify procedures, clause 17 proposes to\r\n\r\nvest  the Minister with powers to amend the First,\r\n\r\nThird and Fourth Schedules to the Income Tax  Act.\r\n\r\nThe First Schedule deals with income tax exemption\r\n\r\nfor  statutory boards and other institutions.  The\r\n\r\nThird Schedule concerns tax on income held by  the\r\n\r\nCustodian of Enemy Property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Fourth  Schedule  lists the  Government  loan\r\n\r\nstocks  where  interest earned therefore  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  half  the tax.  As  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nalready  empowered to reduce tax or give exemption\r\n\r\nin  the main Act, it would simplify procedures  to\r\n\r\nvest  in  him  the  powers to  amend  these  three\r\n\r\nSchedules  as  well.  It  is  intended  that   the\r\n\r\nremaining two Schedules in the Act, the Second and\r\n\r\nthe Fifth Schedules, which deal with the rates  of\r\n\r\nincome   tax   and   amount   of   child   reliefs\r\n\r\nrespectively should continue to be amended only by\r\n\r\nParliament as these two Schedules would  affect  a\r\n\r\ngreat number of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments are either consequential\r\n\r\nin  nature  or  are  meant to tidy  up  procedural\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely would like to say a few\r\n\r\nwords  on  clause 2 of this Bill, which  provision\r\n\r\nmay  have  quite  unforeseen consequences  in  its\r\n\r\nimplementation. One could foresee a  situation  in\r\n\r\nwhich   a  professional  man  may  have  committed\r\n\r\nprofessional     misconduct,    justifying     the\r\n\r\nComptroller   laying   a  complaint   before   the\r\n\r\nappropriate professional body authorised  to  take\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  action  but  whose  client  may   be\r\n\r\nentirely   innocent.  In  such  a  situation   any\r\n\r\ncomplaint laid by the Comptroller would result  in\r\n\r\nthe  confidential tax problem of the client  being\r\n\r\ndiscussed by other professional men who sit in the\r\n\r\nappropriate  disciplinary committee  and  who  may\r\n\r\nwell  represent  other  clients  with  conflicting\r\n\r\nvested  interests  in  the  same  matter.  Such  a\r\n\r\nsituation would nullify the protection afforded to\r\n\r\na  taxpayer by the secrecy provision of the Income\r\n\r\nTax Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I agree that clause 2 is desirable for\r\n\r\npreventing   a  particular  form  of  professional\r\n\r\nabuse, the machinery for its implementation, as it\r\n\r\nnow stands, is wholly inappropriate in the context\r\n\r\nof  a  taxpayer's rights. This particular  problem\r\n\r\nshould be looked into in greater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndepth, in fact, Sir, on second thought, I  really\r\n\r\nwonder  what prevents the Comptroller from  laying\r\n\r\nsuch    a   complaint   before   the   appropriate\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  body in a given case  regardless  of\r\n\r\nthe provision of the proposed clause 2.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these comments, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just wish to make observations\r\n\r\non  some of the clauses in this Bill. On clause  3\r\n\r\n(a)  of the Bill, I am sure the shipping community\r\n\r\nwill welcome this proviso which no doubt will give\r\n\r\na  fillip to shipping activity in Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nproviso  excludes  from tax the  balancing  charge\r\n\r\narising  on  the sale of a Singapore ship.  Up  to\r\n\r\nnow,  because of the absence of such a  provision,\r\n\r\nthe  Comptroller  has sought to tax  this  charge.\r\n\r\nThis  measure  has  to  some extent  defeated  the\r\n\r\npurpose of section 13 (A) of the Act, that is,  to\r\n\r\nexempt  from  tax  the  income  derived  from  the\r\n\r\nemployment  or  charter of a Singapore  registered\r\n\r\nship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clause that I wish to dwell on is\r\n\r\nclause  4  (a) of the Bill. I feel that  this  new\r\n\r\namendment  will no doubt further assist  Singapore\r\n\r\nshipping  but something should he said in  respect\r\n\r\nof  the drafting of this clause. In clause  4  (a)\r\n\r\nparagraph  (w) the use of the term \"substantially\"\r\n\r\ncan   give   rise  to  problems  of   construction\r\n\r\nespecially in the absence of a definition  of  the\r\n\r\nterm  in this Bill or in the Income Tax Act. I  am\r\n\r\nled to wonder why the draftsmen have not chosen to\r\n\r\nemploy  a phraseology giving a definite number  of\r\n\r\ndays  in a year instead, as in clause 4 (b)  where\r\n\r\nthe words \"sixty days in the year\" are used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on clause 5 (a), (b) and (c) of the Bill,\r\n\r\nthis   is  another  favourable  development.  This\r\n\r\namendment no longer makes it mandatory for capital\r\n\r\nallowances  to be deducted from the  income  of  a\r\n\r\nshipping enterprise. At present, this is necessary\r\n\r\nin  determining the exempt profits, the  resultant\r\n\r\nof  which  is that in many cases, as the  Minister\r\n\r\nquite rightly said, the huge allowances cancel the\r\n\r\nprofits  leaving  little or nothing  for  dividend\r\n\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am in some difficulty in replying to these\r\n\r\ncriticisms  because they are matters of  technical\r\n\r\ndetail.  On  the  first proposal  about  revealing\r\n\r\ninformation  on taxpayers' matters I thought  that\r\n\r\nwe  had  taken  care  of  the  problem  which  was\r\n\r\npresented   and  that  this  had  been   carefully\r\n\r\ndrafted.  I do not know in what way this provision\r\n\r\ncan  be improved. If the Member for Kuo Chuan  has\r\n\r\nany  special change in the drafting, perhaps  this\r\n\r\ncould be moved in the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that this provision was satisfactory. I\r\n\r\nassume   that   professional  bodies   often   get\r\n\r\ninformation which they must keep confidential even\r\n\r\nin their proceedings before the professional body.\r\n\r\nThe  names  of  the particular taxpayer  could  be\r\n\r\nsuppressed. Names could be omitted or replaced  by\r\n\r\nalphabetical  symbols  and  the  details  of   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer  need  not be given. The  nature  of  the\r\n\r\nmisconduct  probably relates only to a  particular\r\n\r\nact  which  may  not  concern  the  whole  of  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer's financial affairs. I would be  prepared\r\n\r\nto listen to any desirable amendment in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the comments by the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens on balancing charges, I think he\r\n\r\nwelcomes  clause  3.  But he  thought  that  under\r\n\r\nclause  4 (a) (w) the word \"substantially\"  should\r\n\r\nbe  defined.  I  will give consideration  to  some\r\n\r\nadministrative    definition    of    the     word\r\n\r\n\"substantially\", but I do not know whether in fact\r\n\r\na  line can be drawn as we have drawn for clause 4\r\n\r\n(b)  (new  subsection (4) )  where  60  days  were\r\n\r\ngiven.  This  is a well recognised limitation  for\r\n\r\nthat  particular purpose -employment exercised  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  by  short-term  visiting  employees.  I\r\n\r\ndoubt  whether  there can be a  very  much  closer\r\n\r\ndefinition  than  the  word  \"substantially\".  The\r\n\r\npoint  is  that in some cases the seaman  is  from\r\n\r\nSingapore and he goes on a ship. The ship probably\r\n\r\noperates  elsewhere but the seaman  comes  for  an\r\n\r\nindeterminate period, I suppose on  leave  or  for\r\n\r\nother     purposes,     back     in     Singapore.\r\n\r\nAdministratively, it is possible to come  to  some\r\n\r\nsatisfactory arrangement but I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  not know whether we can do much better in  the\r\n\r\nlegal  definition in stating the total  number  of\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member made another comment on clause 5 (a)\r\n\r\nwhich I was not clear about. This is in respect of\r\n\r\nallowances   which   leave  nothing   for   income\r\n\r\ndistribution.

But  this\r\n\r\nclause will enable him to lay a complaint in a way\r\n\r\nwhich  will not reveal very much of the taxpayer's\r\n\r\nfinancial affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  want  to be sure that we can, in fact,  lay  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint.

I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  if the Member takes the  view  that\r\n\r\nmaking  a  complaint  means that  we  must  reveal\r\n\r\ninformation, then it means that we cannot  make  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint  of  misconduct. My point  is  that  the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  can be laid, the name of  the  taxpayer\r\n\r\nsuppressed,  and  the details of his  tax  affairs\r\n\r\nneed  not be revealed except to the extent of that\r\n\r\nparticular piece of misconduct. At the moment  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the  Comptroller  is  that  he\r\n\r\ncannot  even  lay  a  complaint  because  of   the\r\n\r\nprohibition in the Act which provides  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  nothing which would  indicate  that  a\r\n\r\ntaxpayer's affairs have been dealt with in such  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint.  I  think we want to relax  it  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  that a complaint can be laid but we would,\r\n\r\nas we have done previously, be quite scrupulous in\r\n\r\ntrying   to   omit   details  which   would   give\r\n\r\ninformation to other people about the  affairs  of\r\n\r\nthe taxpayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether we can resolve it by just\r\n\r\npostponing consideration in Committee. It is not a\r\n\r\nmatter of drafting. It is a matter of whether,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  the  principle  must be  preserved  -  that\r\n\r\nnothing  should  be revealed at  all  so  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot even lay a complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> That is so, Mr Speaker, Sir, but if the client\r\n\r\nconcerned is completely innocent then, of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  going to be very hard on him just  because\r\n\r\nhis   professional   adviser   has   mis-conducted\r\n\r\nhimself.

Foreign investments and fixed assets in\r\n\r\nthe manufacturing sector rose from $10 million  in\r\n\r\n1964  to  $2,930 million by the end  of  1974,  an\r\n\r\naverage annual increase of 40%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High oil prices, inflation and massive\r\n\r\nunemployment,  even  in industrialised  countries,\r\n\r\nhave  slowed  down our ability to attract  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments in industry into Singapore. Industrial\r\n\r\ninvestment  commitments in 1974 amounted  to  $829\r\n\r\nmillion, less than the figure of $957 million  the\r\n\r\nyear  before.  Though  the  prospects  of  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  into  Singapore  are  currently  less\r\n\r\nencouraging, the international division of  labour\r\n\r\nwill go on inexorably. Industries in Japan, Europe\r\n\r\nand  North  America, which find that they  can  no\r\n\r\nlonger  compete if they continue manufacturing  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  countries, will seek to  locate  their\r\n\r\noperations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverseas in countries where the factors  of\r\n\r\nproduction are more in their favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, located in the midst of a rapidly\r\n\r\ngrowing  region of great mineral and  agricultural\r\n\r\npotential, is one of perhaps no more than a  dozen\r\n\r\ncountries in the world in which multi-national and\r\n\r\neven  smaller-sized companies will consider it  in\r\n\r\ntheir interest to position themselves to face  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  changed irreversibly by the oil producers\r\n\r\nof OPEC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil producers' successful change of the terms\r\n\r\nof  trade  so much in their favour and so  swiftly\r\n\r\nmarks an economic watershed. It presents Singapore\r\n\r\nwith immediate as well as long-term opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe   more  urgent  search  for  oil  has  greatly\r\n\r\nbenefited Singapore's marine and offshore-oil-rigs\r\n\r\nconstruction and logistics industries.  In  recent\r\n\r\nmonths,    the   Economic   Development    Board's\r\n\r\ninvestment centre in Houston, which is  noted  for\r\n\r\nthe  number  of US oil industry companies  located\r\n\r\nthere, has been most active. In the long-term, the\r\n\r\nhigher price of oil will raise the cost of sea  or\r\n\r\nair   transportation  substantially.  Energy   and\r\n\r\nmineral  intensive industries  would  have  to  be\r\n\r\nlocated  nearer  the sources of raw  materials  or\r\n\r\nnearer  the markets for their products. Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith   its   well-developed  human  and   physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure in the midst of a resource rich and\r\n\r\npopulous  region, is well placed  to  compete  for\r\n\r\nsuch industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relatively higher price of energy should help\r\n\r\nalso  to improve the competitive position  of  our\r\n\r\nestablished industries. The textiles and garments,\r\n\r\nelectrical   and   electronic,   and   woodworking\r\n\r\nindustries have played and will continue to play a\r\n\r\nsignificant role in Singapore's industrialisation.\r\n\r\nValue  added  by these three groups of  industries\r\n\r\nrose  from  21%  in 1970 to 31% in 1974  of  total\r\n\r\nvalue added by the manufacturing sector. They have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  do this because, these  industries\r\n\r\nhave  been continually improving their design  and\r\n\r\nquality  through heavier investment  in  machinery\r\n\r\nand technical training. Value added per worker  in\r\n\r\nthe  textile  and  garment  industries  more  than\r\n\r\ntrebled  from $1,960 in 1965 to $6,900 last  year.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, value\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadded  per  worker  in  the woodworking  industry,\r\n\r\nwhich  progressed from simple sawmilling to  wood-moulding,  almost doubled from $4,170 in  1965  to\r\n\r\n$7,100  last year. Value added per worker  in  the\r\n\r\nelectronics industry rose from $7,000 in  1965  to\r\n\r\n$18,000  last  year as the industry advanced  from\r\n\r\ncomponent   assembling  to   instrumentation   and\r\n\r\ntesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have quoted these value added figures at some\r\n\r\nlength  because of a tendency to dismiss  the  so-called  cheap textile and electronics  industries.\r\n\r\nThese  industries  far from declining  should,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   grow   even  stronger.  In   future,   all\r\n\r\nmanufacturing industries spurred on by the  higher\r\n\r\nprice of oil would have to compete on the basis of\r\n\r\norganisation  and  equipment  rather  than  simple\r\n\r\nunskilled  labour. A relatively earlier start  and\r\n\r\nnearness  to energy sources would enable Singapore\r\n\r\nto  compete  on equal, if not better,  terms  with\r\n\r\ncountries further away from Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONSUMER PROTECTION (TRADE DESCRIPTIONS AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already an offence to apply a false trade\r\n\r\ndescription  to goods under the Merchandise  Marks\r\n\r\nAct.

The\r\n\r\ncoverage   of   the  Bill  is   not   limited   to\r\n\r\ndescriptions  appearing on products,  but  extends\r\n\r\nalso  to false information given in the course  of\r\n\r\nenquiries or advertisements or oral statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the disclosure of\r\n\r\nadditional   particulars  of  goods   where   such\r\n\r\ninformation  is  lacking  and  of  importance   to\r\n\r\nconsumers. It is not intended, however,  that  the\r\n\r\ndisclosure provisions will require the publication\r\n\r\nof  trade  secrets or formulae. Indeed,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nmakes it an offence for any person to disclose  to\r\n\r\nany  other  person  such  information  if  he  has\r\n\r\nobtained them in pursuance of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Bill provides that advertisements\r\n\r\nare  to  be  regulated so as to prevent misleading\r\n\r\nstatements   in  relation  to  the   goods   being\r\n\r\nadvertised.
