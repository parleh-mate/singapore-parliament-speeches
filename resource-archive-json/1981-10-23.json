I had been retained by Yusof Ishak, the Managing Director of Utusan Melayu, to represent his detained editor, Samad Ismail. Between the 4th and 8th January, 1951, a year and a half previously, the Special Branch had arrested the first big batch of about 20 English-educated Communist cadres, probationary members, and members of the Anti-British League. It was a shock to people that these privileged English - educated intelligentsia and professionals had thrown in their lot with the Communists to overturn the system. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were given special treatment, better rations than the average detainee. Theirs was a European diet, with butter and eggs and meat. Instead of Changi Prison, one camp of the Opium Addict Rehabilitation Centre at St. John's had been set aside for them. There, under the shade of a tembusu tree outside the chain-link fence, Samad and I sat on two wooden chairs with a small wooden table between us. Beyond the fence was a rectangular-shaped hut, isolated from the opium addicts, in case they were infected by more dangerous cravings. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of these detainees watched us as I took my instructions. Samad wondered what a lawyer could do for him. I made notes and talked about conditions on St. John's. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the chain-link fence, I spied a bespectacled Indian in shorts and slippers. He had a particularly pugnacious, angry face. He was short and squat. Samad told me he was his good friend, Devan Nair, an official of the Singapore Teachers' Union. He told me that under detention it was easy to see who were weaklings and who were strong men. He said his friend was a strong man. Later, I learned from R.B. Corridon, the Special Branch officer in charge of this group, that Nair was a member of the Anti-British League and was being cultivated for full CPM membership. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine years later, in June 1961, when the parting of the ways came for the Communist United Front and the PAP, Devan Nair was the only one strong enough to stand by the PAP and resist the takeover bid by the Communists. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony was he had been the Communist thorn in the PAP's side from 1954 to 1956, when he was on the Central Executive Committee of the PAP, always pressing views which advanced the Communist cause. When, however, the parting of the ways came in July 1961 after the Anson By-election between the Communists and the non-Communists in the PAP, he was absolutely staunch and courageous. Unlike those who treacherously went back on their solemn pledges of loyalty in a non-Communist PAP, he soldiered on with us. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, more than anybody else, knew what the Communists would do to those who turned against them. He, more than anybody else, knew how dedicated, how fanatical, how tireless, how totally ruthless they were. These were the qualities which had won him over to their cause. These were qualities which made them formidable opponents. But dedication and resolve were also qualities he had. He knew he took grave risks when he threw himself wholeheartedly with the non-Communist leadership in the PAP. He knew how thin and inexperienced the PAP leadership was, how weak its organization, how short of cadres, how lacking in fanaticism, ruthlessness, and zeal the PAP cadres were. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the Communists lost: first, in the Referendum in September 1962 for merger and Malaysia, then in the elections for the Legislative Assembly in September 1963. Devan Nair had contested and lost in Farrer Park in the first elections in 1955. In March 1964, as a Malaysian citizen born in Malacca, the PAP fielded him for the seat of Bungsar, near Kuala Lumpur, in the Malaysian general elections. Of nine candidates, he was the only one who won. When the break with Malaysia came in 1965, he stayed behind to lead the PAP, later to become the DAP. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not lack of courage that made him leave Kuala Lumpur. The Cabinet decided that Singapore-Malaysia relations would always be bedevilled if Devan Nair remained as a DAP leader. I persuaded him to come back. I told him that the trade union movement in Singapore had to be rebuilt on different assumptions and with different attitudes. We had to have a union movement that would make Singapore a secure place to invest in. We wanted workers to be productive, capital to be safe, and yields to be high. He agreed to return to Singapore and made his preparations. In May 1969, when the Malaysian elections took place, he was in America, amongst other places, at the South-east Asia Studies Centre at Yale. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came back to Singapore, he threw himself into a modernization programme for the NTUC. The last 12 years \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> have seen the re-education of our union leaders and workers into the realities making a living for Singapore and for Singaporeans. Leaders and workers are learning the meaning of management and productivity through the actual running of enterprises like NTUC insurance, INCOME, through the supermarkets in WELCOME, through running a fleet of taxis and vans in COMFORT. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us old enough to remember the trade unionists and the workers of the 1950's, those of us who remember the simple but fearsome slogans of fighting the wicked colonialists and imperialists, or fighting the blood-sucking employers, must have found it ironic that this same group of union leaders was placed in this predicament. Instead of fierce speeches urging rebellion, they now had earnestly and painstakingly to explain the need for hard work, an honest day's wage for an honest day's work, an end to malingering and obstructionism, and a stop to industrial strife. If these leaders lacked the moral courage to change gears and to take a difficult U-turn at great speed, Singapore would not have made it. Without a capacity to rise above themselves and admit that their earlier compre- hension of problems was incomplete, without the courage to admit their errors and to persuade their followers to change course, modern Singapore would not have come about. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One golden thread runs through this broad tapestry of events covering the last 30 years - total dedication to a cause bigger than ourselves. Without such a cause, Devan Nair would not have been much different from the many school teachers or headmasters we have in Singapore. It was this total, complete commitment to fight and to work for a better society that brought out his strengths. His moral fibre withstood the pressures and the heat of crises. Because he wanted to do something about the sufferings and deprivations of the people, he became a tower of strength in our battles against the Communists and the Communalists. It needed fortitude to cease playing the hero, the strike \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> leader, and instead to re-educate the workers, to reshape their attitudes towards management, from a confrontational to a cooperational one. The re-education is not yet complete. Some of the old adversary attitudes and antagonisms still linger on. Nevertheless, the tide has been turned. Changes are moving in the right direction and it is left to younger leaders to complete this task. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, when I first learned that the late President was critically ill, I asked the Cabinet to name possible successors. The Speaker and a few others outside Cabinet were also asked to help in the search. Eventually, a shortlist was settled. It had to be a different selection from 1970 or from 1959. For then, the distinguished men in their 5O's and 60's who had the attributes for the office were not directly involved in the political struggles of Singapore. They were a generation or two older than we were. They were apart from the fray. This time, the generation in their late 5O's and 60's was our generation, the same age group as my senior colleagues and myself. Anybody with any strength of character had taken sides. There are few outstanding men in the generation of Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam, Toh Chin Chye, K.M. Byrne, who were bystanders. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final shortlist of four, only one was not connected with the PAP. He was colourless compared to Devan Nair. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to enumerate Devan Nair's merits. Nor need I describe his temperament or his character. Many know him personally. Many more have read of him. Often, in the last 30 years of active public life, he has had to bare his soul. When I approached him in June, some three weeks after the late President's death, he was taken aback. I asked him to take his time to reflect on it. I told him that becoming President did not mean that he had to be quiet and bland. At 58, he could not but continue to be himself. The difference was that, in this role, he should be non-partisan. He had to rise above the fray between the PAP and the other political parties who aspired to be the government. He would have to represent all Singaporeans. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Communists who break with their faith immediately embrace another religion, with equal fervour. For these people, Communism had been their religion. When they reject Communism, they become as intense in their anti-communism as they were fanatical and irrational in their Communism. Most suffer psychological cracks, like those hairline cracks on a porcelain vase which has been carefully mended but will give way again when filled and under pressure. Devan Nair is an exception. He has retained his sense of proportion, his balance, and his equanimity. His moral fibre withstood the trauma of the rejection of his former faith in Communism. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who have known him well are confident that he will rise above his loyalties to the NTUC and the PAP to embrace a broader spectrum of loyal Singaporeans. We cannot change his character, his way of life, or his habits of a life-time. Indeed, they are his strengths. What will change is his role. From defender and champion of the workers, he must now become a focal point for all Singaporeans to identify themselves with. He can still be colourful, still be approachable, still be pungent; but he must be above the political fray. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His style must be uniquely his. After two weeks of deliberation, he asked me if he could continue to move freely and informally as he had always done, without the trappings of the President. He feared that these would cut him off from his old friends and fellow workers. I assure him from this Chamber that there is no reason why he should always be on parade. There will, of course, be times when he must be on parade, with ADCs, Guards of Honour, escorts, and all the pomp and circumstance that go with the office. There is no reason why, however, at ease and in mufti, he should not continue to be his old self. Indeed, his best contribution is to be himself. And if he makes it possible for those who had previously disagreed with him to feel that he is now President of Singapore, their President, that will be his best measure of success. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men who have long years been in office develop a knack of taking the measure of the other men they meet. Those who meet Devan Nair will recognize that he is a man out of the ordinary. He will not diminish the high standing of the office of President. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members, many of whom have known him for more than 20 years, will want to join me in wishing him success. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article 17 of the Constitution, elects Mr Chengara Veetil Devan Nair as President of the Republic of Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>2.51 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar (Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Ahmad Mattar)</b>( \n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the Motion by the Prime Minister to elect Mr C.V. Devan Nair as President of the Republic of Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Nair has made an immense contribution towards the growth of a responsible trade union movement in Singapore. In 1959, when the People's Action Party first assumed office, trade unions were infiltrated by Communists. They were manipulated by the Communists to serve their own political aims. The relationship between employers and unions was one of confrontation. And there was widespread disruption caused by strikes and lockouts. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1960s, largely as a result of a tireless and courageous struggle waged by Mr Nair, the trade union movement was purged of communists and fellow-travellers. With the formation of the National Trades Union Congress, the movement assumed its proper role of safeguarding the long-term interests of workers and strengthening the foundations of economic and social development in the Republic. It is only fitting that, at a time- when the workers of Singapore are consciously striving to improve the quality of our products and improve the efficiency of our methods of production, a trade unionist of Mr Nair's stature should be elected to the high office of President. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the relatively short period that he served as a Member of this House, Mr Nair earned a reputation as a distinguished parliamentarian. We, the Members of this House, are justly proud that, for the first time, a former Member is being elevated to the office of President. We shall miss him in this Chamber. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a devoted husband and father, Mr Nair will symbolize the value that our society places on the sanctity of the family. In the midst of his many public duties, he has always found time to be with his family. He is a shining example for our younger generation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own personal acquaintance with Mr Nair dates back to 1972. In all my dealings with him, I have always found him to be humane and considerate, but unyielding on matters of principle. His sense of humour has lowered the temperature at many a meeting. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is with feelings of great pride that I support the Motion to elect this distinguished citizen as the President of the Republic of Singapore. \n  <br>2.55 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>( \n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Motion moved by the Prime Minister. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, various newspapers have given a very detailed description and account of the life and career of Mr Devan Nair, while people from different quarters have also expressed various views in the newspapers on his impending appointment as the third President of the Republic. This shows the concern that we all have for the affairs of the nation, and it is a good manifestation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, with the concurrence of the Cabinet, has moved the Motion for the election of Mr Devan Nair as President. This Motion must have been arrived at after much searching and very careful consideration, This Government is one that is very responsible to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> the people and is not perfunctory in all its affairs. Such a government would certainly not have made the choice of a prestigious appointment as the President of a country without having viewed the long-term perspective and weighed the relative priorities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From considerations of the long-term perspective and relative priorities, in the context of an increasingly complex modern society, Mr Devan Nair is an appropriate choice for the Presidency. Looking from his life and career, we can say that Mr Devan Nair is a leader of the masses, a leader who could endure hardship, not minding personal loss or interests, not submitting to force or coercion, and faithful to principles. While we want a rugged and brave society, what he possesses is a rugged and brave spirit. The newspapers say that he has \"s set of tough bones.\" This is most appropriate. All along, Sir, whether in the field of trade unionism or in politics, Mr Devan Nair had with this same spirit undauntingly made candid speeches at home and abroad in the interest of Singapore. This spirit of rationally fighting and arguing for the interest of the nation is one that is most sublime and supreme. It is because of this spirit in him that it is right and proper for him to assume the supreme office of President of the notion without any compunction. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that I should support the Motion by the Prime Minister. \n  <br>2.58 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr M.K.A. Jabbar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr M.K.A. Jabbar (Radin Mas)</b>( \n  <i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Members who spoke before me welcomed the Motion moved by our Prime Minister and expressed their views and congratulated Mr Devan Nair. At this juncture, I too would like to join them and give my support to Mr Devan Nair as one who has been a colleague in the trade union movement, as one who has impressed me as a true friend of the workers, and as a supreme leader among trade union leaders. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out that for a Republic which has developed itself with the strength of workers as its backbone, it is indeed \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> befitting that a trade unionist who has sacrificed himself for the welfare of the workers becomes a President. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not only a trade unionist, he is also a social worker, a friend of the less fortunate, saviour of the poor. He wishes to seek reform in everything. He has not deviated from the path of morality, He is a great thinker. He has the feel of the pulse of the people. He has intertwined himself with the growth of Singapore. Indeed it is fortunate for Singaporeans to get him as President. I am proud and happy to say that Mr Devan Nair's service as a peace maker between employers and employees has earned him a place in the hearts of foreign trade unionists as well. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election of Mr Devan Nair, the architect of trade union movement in Singapore, as the third President, will no doubt open a new chapter in the history of the Republic. Mr Devan Nair, who has the qualities of perseverance, selfless dedication, patience, commitment, and the courage to accept what is right and to reject what is wrong, is most suited to become the President of the Republic. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end my speech by saying that I hope he will continue his service to the people and the nation in the field of economics and spiritualism, and I hope we will have a prosperous nation in the future. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Motion moved by the Prime Minister. \n  <br>3.03 p.m. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I fully support the Motion moved by the Hon. Prime Minister to elect Mr C. V. Devan Nair as President of our Republic. It has been my good fortune to have enjoyed a long association with Mr Nair, spanning two decades. I can therefore lay claim to speaking about him with some intimacy and knowledge. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Devan is a friend, and I am also proud to say that he was my mentor. I first met him in 1960 when I was Secretary of the Singapore Printing Employees' Union, seeking advice from him on how best to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> improve pay and working conditions for the union's members. Mr Nair was confident that with the pro-Labour PAP Government that recently swept into power, my task would not be too difficult. He was right. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devan taught me much of what I now know of the Labour movement and of politics. To list the lessons I learnt from him would be tiresome and meaningless, because these were acquired through years of experience and practice. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one acknowledgement of my debt to Devan I wish to make is that he enabled me to differentiate between the national interest and narrow sectoral interests. Further, he could read situations and distinguish clearly between friend and foe - an ability I believe all sound politicians possess. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Devan Nair's background and history are matters of public record. I shall not go into them, except to state that with his humble origin, with his dynamism, with his sharp intellect and international stature, with his proven contribution to the Singapore of today, I have no doubt he will add strength of character to the presidency. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I were asked to point out the greatest single thing Devan Nair has done for our country, I would say this. I am firmly convinced that without Devan Nair at the helm of the trade union movement in the 60's and 70's, and without his unbending will to succeed against daunting odds as the non-Communists struggled for survival against the Communists in the 5O's and 60's, Singapore might have been a very different place today. Without Devan Nair's leadership, I think the NTUC would not have withstood the united front onslaught of the Barisan Sosialis nor would the Labour movement have transformed itself into a forward-looking, and positive force it now is in the present context of our economy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we should not look upon Mr Devan Nair's elevation to the presidency as a loss to the trade union movement, although it is that too. Rather, we should regard it as a gain for the whole of Singapore. With Devan out of the NTUC altogether, the able young men \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> now in charge will have no 'safety net' so to speak. His departure from the trade union scene is thus significant in that the process of self-renewal in Singapore trade unionism may be taken to be complete. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new union leaders must henceforth make it on their own steam, and be visibly seen to be doing so. In a real sense, with Devan Nair leaving the Labour movement, an era in Singapore is ending; his signal contribution in one sphere of Singapore's development, and his unique role therein, is over. Another phase is about to begin in Devan Nair's life. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ask ourselves honestly: can he do the job? Is he fit for it? I have searched my mind and my soul, and I have found the answers to both questions as \"Yes.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One issue needs to be addressed, and that is the notion that as a politician, as a Party man, Devan Nair should perhaps not be chosen for a non-partisan, non-political post. My response to this proposition is two-fold. First, the most important criterion in the selection of our presidency should be the person, and not solely his past background. If Devan Nair is judged to be able to benefit Singapore in the office of the presidency, the fact that he was formerly a politician should not rob Singaporeans of the man as a potential president. Mark you, Devan has resigned all union, party and political posts. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I am absolutely sure that, in the course of his duties as our next President, he will be able to conduct himself impartially and be above the hurly-burly of partisan politics. This may not come easy to him, having been a keen combatant in the political arena all these years, but I am confident he has the discipline and the statesmanship required of him. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devan's role will not be simple. Many Presidents of modern republics have to bear the dubious distinction of having responsibility without power, while not avoiding the onerous tasks, both ceremonial and constitutional, that accompany the office. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Head of State, the President is the focal point of loyalty in our young and diverse Republic, as well as our symbol of unity. The President is the living depository of all things Singaporean, and there is in truth no better person qualified to fill this post than Devan Nair. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we all have heard what the Prime Minister and other Members of this House have said about Devan Nair, and therefore in supporting this Motion I am sure the House will join me in wishing him well, good health and good grace. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Article 17 of the Constitution, elects Mr Chengara Veetil Devan Nair as President of the Republic of Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>RESIGNATION OF MR C.V.

Member for Pasir Panjang, I want to point out that the training and re-training of workers in Singapore takes place in a wide variety of ways both in the private and the public sectors. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the inception of the Skills Development Fund in January 1980, some 22 months ago, a new impetus has been given to the training of workers. An indication of the growing emphasis on training can perhaps be seen from the rate of application for grants from the SDF submitted by firms. The number of applications has grown from 58 during the first three months when the Fund was started to 820 during the three months from June to August 1981, an increase of 14 times. At mid-September a total of $43 million had been approved for 1,816 successful applications. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the opportunities for formal training and specific schemes? These can be divided into several categories which meet the needs of different types of workers. They are: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Apprenticeship schemes which are provided by VITB and the EDB Training Centres in close collaboration with specific firms or industry groups. In 1980 there were some 6,900 apprentices employed by 301 firms. These apprentices are usually given block-period release to attend courses run by VITB and the EDB Centres. They also undergo supervised field training in their companies. The apprentices are paid a salary during the training period. Upon their successfully completing their National Trade Certification, they are required to continue to work for their employer for a period of one to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> two years to fulfil their obligation for having received apprenticeship training. The major apprenticeship schemes are in the metal machining trade, the shipbuilding and shiprepairing industry, the motor vehicle maintenance trade and the building construction industry. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Evening and day-release courses at the Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic which lead to the Diploma qualification. In 1980 there were some 5,600 working people registered for such courses. This scheme enables those who have previously missed the opportunity to work for a higher qualification. The most popular courses are Electronics, Mechanical and Civil Engineering and Industrial Management. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Continuing Education courses run by the VITB. There is a wide variety of such courses. Broadly speaking, these can be subdivided into: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) ad hoc special courses mounted at the request of employers who want to upgrade their workers. In 1980, some 7,200 workers took part in such courses. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Part-time commercial courses mainly leading to external examinations. In 1980, about 2,500 workers enrolled for such courses. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Part-time general education courses at different levels from Secondary 1 to Pre-U 2, as well as Worker's Foundation Course for those with only Primary level education. In 1980, about 10,300 working people enrolled for such courses. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Part-time language courses. In 1980, the enrolment for these courses was around 7,000. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I have briefly described, there are various opportunities for working people in Singapore to improve themselves through part-time courses.

Jayakumar) (for the Minister for Home Affairs): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are motor-cyclists who participate in organized racing activities along expressways and public roads. Such \"hell\" riders, as they are known, are charged in court for rash riding, dangerous riding or riding at excessive speeds. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 12 months (1st October 1980 to 30th September 1981). 75 motor-cyclists were charged in court for participating in hell-riding activities along expressways. Of these, 10 were charged with rash riding, 22 with dangerous riding and 43 with riding at excessive speeds. The fines imposed on them by the courts ranged from $100 to $1,800. A few of them were also disqualified from holding licences for periods from one to five years. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of operations mounted by the Traffic Police against hell-riders. These are enforcement operations and preventive operations. Enforcement operations are mounted in known hell-riding areas such as the East coast Expressway, Bukit Timah Expressway and, lately, Marymount Road, or when prior information is received that hell-riding activities will be held at a certain place. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive operations are mounted when groups of motor-cyclists are detected proceeding towards or gathering at known hell-riding areas. These operations are aimed at dissuading motor-cyclists from participating in such activities. Motor-cycles which have been tuned for racing or modified illegally in other ways are impounded for mechanical inspection. Police teams are regularly deployed along known hell-riding areas, especially in the late hours of Saturday nights and the eve of public holidays. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the problem cannot be totally eradicated. As long as there are motor-cyclists willing to gamble their lives for thrills or gain, hell-riding activities will surface from time to time. The Traffic Police is constantly vigilant against such activities. Strict enforcement action is taken and the courts are urged to impose severe deterrent punishments. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term solution to this problem must come from a change in the attitude of motor-cyclists. This can be achieved through better road education. When the plans for training courses for motor-cyclists referred to by the Minister in Parliament at its sitting on 14th August 1981 are implemented in three to four years' time, road safety consciousness should be enhanced. It is hoped that when the danger posed by hell-riding activities and its consequences are driven home to all motor-cyclists, they will desist from such activities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the cooperation of the public is also needed.

Most of them, West Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Finland, and Bulgaria, require annual inspection of all cars. Some of them, like Sweden, United Kingdom and Austria, require inspection of cars more than two to three years old. Most of these countries have had at least 20 years' experience in inspecting vehicles and have decided on their present standards after much study and refinement. Based on their experience, we will begin inspecting cars more than five years old in 1982 and cars more than three years old in 1983.

This Staff Association has a room which the officers can use. They can gather together for a chit-chat over a cup of tea. They can play indoor games, including electronic games. They do so during lunch time or after office hours. The Staff Association also organizes outdoor games and excursions. We believe that the promotion of such activities will encourage esprit de corps among the staff which will also improve their productivity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry has a Staff Development Committee which looks after the welfare and career development of Labour Officers. Since its formation in 1978, the Committee has charted the career paths of the officers. Postings of officers are planned to give them on-the-job training in the various aspects of labour work. Systematic training in labour laws and practices, labour economics, productivity, supervision, communication and other areas of labour work, such as industrial relations, labour statistics and employment promotion are provided. Outstanding officers have been identified and groomed for more responsible appointments. These officers are sent for formal courses overseas when identified. Programmes for the training and career development of officers will promote productivity and loyalty. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Ministry has set up what is called a Productivity Enhancement Team.

It is prone to damage by erosion because of poor drainage. Traffic on it has become heavy since the construction of Woodlands New Town. Although the road has a tarred surface, damage is primarily on the untarred road shoulders which vehicles drive onto to avoid oncoming traffic. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neo Tiew Road itself is not within the SAF training area. Therefore, it is occasionally used by SAF units at Woodlands and Sungei Gedong as a convenient by-pass to gain access to the training areas in the western and northern sectors of the island. More than 95% of the traffic comprises civilian tippers and other heavy goods vehicles. MINDEF vehicles are therefore not the primary cause of damage to the road. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Chua Chu Kang may be pleased to know that MINDEF has requested the Public Works Department to look into the need to upgrade the road. In the meantime, the SAF will continue to assist in the repair of the road on the basis of gotong royong as has been done in the past, even though the contribution from SAF vehicles to the damage of the road is less than 5%. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, any supplementary question? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am quite happy with the answer, Sir. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION IN HDB LIFTS</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Effectiveness of)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Liew Kok Pun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. \n  <b>Mr Liew Kok Pun</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the preliminary findings of the pilot project of installing closed circuit television (CCTV) in Housing and Development Board lifts which is intended to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing the crime rate and urinating in HDB lifts: and (b) if it is effective, whether the H D B has any plan to install CCTV in all its lifts and what would be the total cost involved. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lee Yock Suan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister for National Development has asked me to answer all the questions concerning the Ministry. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of installing closed circuit television (CCTV) in HDB lifts is to prevent robbery and sex crimes.

The system is therefore not completely reliable. The HDB is quite hesitant to install CCTV in all its lifts, as the capital cost involved is $20 million and the annual maintenance cost is $6 million. To cover these costs, HDB residents may have to pay $2 per month higher conservancy and service charges. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB is now studying other lift security systems in order to choose a more effective and cheaper alternative. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ANG MO KIO NEW TOWN</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Multi-storey car parks)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. \n  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether there are any plans to construct multi-storey car parks in Ang Mo Kio New Town to alleviate the current inadequacy of parking lots. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are 55 car parks providing 13,625 parking lots in Ang Mo Kio New Town.

A population reasonably proficient in at least two languages is an advantage which nobody can deny. However, we must take care that raw emotions should never be allowed to cloud the issue and steer the campaign away from its declared objective. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a campaign aimed at the Chinese Singaporean community.

A start has already been made in the schools. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Parliament of Chinese descent, and indeed all Chinese Singaporean adults, are free to adopt Hanyu Pinyin names if they so wish.

It overturned and fell onto the road below. Investigations show that the flyover was structurally sound and the beam was properly designed and manufactured. It fell because the temporary supporting wedges used by the contractor had apparently been knocked out of place by workmen engaged in other work nearby. The contractor has admitted full liability for the incident. Immediate steps were taken to check the tightness of the wedges for the other beams.

Power supply to these three cables was switched off by their protection system. The protection system is a subsidiary electrical circuit whose function is to prevent the main power cable from being damaged by excessive flow of current. The circuit is normally dormant but is activated when it detects a fault in the main cable. The cable is then automatically switched off. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigation revealed that there was no fault or damage in the three 230kv cables themselves and they were put back into service. The protection system has been isolated. PUB engineers and the manufacturers are investigating the cause of the fault in the protection system. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power failures can be caused by faulty equipment and damage to cables due to ground subsidence, careless contractors and inclement weather. In planning our electricity supply system, the PUB has taken steps to install equipment and plant that are reliable. There are built-in safety devices to prevent small faults from developing into major ones, that can cause damage to the equipment or, worse. a total system breakdown. Regular preventive maintenance is carried out. Notwithstanding all these precautions, however, equipment failure can still occur in a large complex power system like ours, which has tripled in size within the last decade. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB has installed a computerized System Control Centre costing $8 million at Ayer Rajah, This Centre constantly monitors power transmission and generation and is manned round the clock. When a fault occurs in any part of the system, power is diverted to other parts of the network. Stand-by generators can also be loaded up. In addition, the System Control Centre has facilities for remote control of major substations to expedite restoration of supply. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB has also taken steps to minimize damage to cables that can lead to power failures. Bare overhead lines are being progressively replaced by insulated wires to reduce power failures caused by failing tree branches. Before carrying out excavation \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> work, contractors are required to locate all underground cables within the worksites by checking plans and digging trial holes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Electricity Department of PUB also maintains a service and operation centre which is on 24-hour call and can handle minor and localized breakdowns of electricity supply. For the more major ones, the PUB Electricity Department has an emergency plan for the mobilization of all its staff. The System Control Centre in Ayer Rajah is the nerve centre in this plan. Power failures are detected almost instantaneously by the Centre. The severity of the breakdown and the areas affected are immediately assessed by the System Control Engineers who will initiate an alert and contact the Chief Electrical Engineer and other key officers. The reIovent engineers and technical officers follow a course of action in accordance with the procedures spelt out in the plan. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In attending to major failures, all 45 engineers and 74 technical officers in the Trans- mission and Distribution Division are involved. Where necessary, engineers and officers in other divisions can be mobilized. The response is immediate as normal maintenance and repair work is temporarily suspended to accord priority to emergencies. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PARKING PROBLEM IN HOUSING BOARD ESTATES</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. \n  <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the the present shortage of parking lots in most of the public housing estates, whether it will be feasible to mark out parking lots along the roadside of minor roads in public housing estates to allow overnight parking to alleviate the problem of indiscriminate overnight parking along the roads; and, if not, what are the plans to ease the increasing parking problem in most Housing and Development Board estates. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir. provision of car parking facilities in the new HDB estates is \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> generally adequate, although it may be insufficient in certain neighbourhoods because of uneven distribution of vehicle ownership relative to parking lots.

Consequently, in 1980, HDB awarded 15,053 units, an all-time low. In the first five months of this year, only 1.931 units were awarded. The situation was aggravated by an astronomical increase in the number of new registrants to purchase and rent flats. To resolve the critical problem, HDB entered into direct negotiations with contractors persuading them to accept contracts at negotiated prices. The results of these direct negotiations have been encouraging. In the last four months, 20,751 units were awarded. Another 10,000 units are expected to be contracted out by the end of this year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To speed up the public housing programme, HDB is also looking into the use of prefabricated methods of construction and the employment of overseas contractors. All these measures, however, will not yield \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> immediate results. The average construction period for a block of high-rise flats is between 2 1/2 and three years. Applicants for public housing must accept the fact that they have to face an average waiting period of 31/2 to four years. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sale prices of flats depend on the construction cost. The HDB has taken the following measures to minimize increases in construction cost - \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to simplify the design of the flats; \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To assist contractors in the recruitment of construction workers from non-traditional sources; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To improve contract conditions, such as giving protection to contractors against price fluctuations of building materials and extending interest-free loans to contractors to purchase equipment and machinery. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>RESETTLEMENT AT KAKI BUKIT</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Particulars)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Saidi Haji Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. \n  <b>Encik Saidi Haji Shariff</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) the total number of families and persons to be resettled to make way for the development of Kaki Bukit Estate; (b) how many of them have so far been resettled by accepting alternative accommodation in Housing and Development Board flats under resettlement priority; (c) when the resettlement of the rest of the affected families and persons will be completed; and (d) whether they will all be allocated flats in the estate they have applied for under resettlement priority. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, a total of 1,425 families have to be resettled to make way for the development of Kaki Bukit Estate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, 205 families have been allocated HDB flats under resenlement priority. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resettlement of all affected families is expected to be completed by 1983. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever possible, the HDB will allocate to affected families flats in the estate of their choice.

It is not that the HDB wants to increase prices. It is because of the rising cost of construction that HDB is forced to increase prices correspondingly. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, in answer to one of the questions, the only way to control prices is to control costs and the HDB is doing its very best to try and do this. There is simply no way we can assure buyers, ahead of time, that the cost will be within a certain range. All I can say is that the situation has improved considerably and that, as compared to previous years, the future increases are likely to be moderate. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Encik Saidi Haji Shariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Encik Saidi Haji Shariff:</b> Sir, the Minister of State is aware that the affected families do not make a voluntary choice to purchase flats.

I think the resettled families are in a similar position as \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> other buyers. The fact that they have been resettled means that they are given priority to choose flats. But there is no assurance that flats will not increase in price. There is no way we can assure that. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, once resettlement is announced, surely the HDB must have a sufficient number of flats to allocate to those who are affected. Would the Minister of State give an assurance that the HDB would not announce a resettlement unless they have a sufficient number of flats to allocate to those people affected? It is really not fair to announce a resettlement and then take a long time to allocate flats. Most of the people who are affected are allocated flats at a certain price while the remainder are allocated flats at a different price. As the hon. Member for Kaki Bukit has pointed out, after all, it is not on their own volition that they want to buy HDB flats. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The answer to the first part is yes. As far as possible, the HDB will try and make sure that there are available flats before they proceed with resettlement of families. But the complication is that some of the resettled families prefer certain areas and sometimes they do not want the flats which are available. So they end up with long waiting periods. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>LIM CHU KANG ROAD</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Widening and upgrading)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. \n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> asked the Minister for National Development what plans his Ministry has to widen and upgrade Lim Chu Kang Road which is being used by heavy traffic as a trunk road linking the Jurong Industrial Estate and the northern part of the island and which is inadequate to accommodate such heavy traffic. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, recent traffic counts conducted by the Public Works Department along the most heavily trafficked \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> stretch of Lim Chu Kang Road near the intersection with Chua Chu Kang showed that peak hour volumes are of the order of 560 to 620 vehicles per hour which are within the capacity of the existing road.

A strike is an extremely serious action with serious implications for the employer affected and the economy in general. It should only be resorted to where there is a trade dispute between the employees and their employer. We cannot allow unions and employees to strike where the trade dispute does not concern their employer. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a strike is illegal if it is in furtherance of a trade dispute which the Industrial \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Arbitration Court has cognizance. The Industrial Relations Act provides for disputes to be settled by the Industrial Arbitration Court. The system of industrial arbitration would be defeated if strikes or lock-outs are allowed after the dispute has been referred to the Industrial Arbitration Court. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a strike is also illegal if it is designed or calculated to coerce the Government either directly or by inflicting hardship on the community. A strike is an industrial matter. It should not be used for the political purpose of coercing the Government. Any grievance against the Government should be taken up in accordance with the procedures provided by the law. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above arguments for disallowing strikes in the above three circumstances apply equally to other forms of industrial action, like a go-slow or a work-to-rule. However, section 3(1) of the Trade Disputes Act does not cover such forms of industrial action. Such forms of industrial action should be brought within the ambit of section 3(1) of the Trade Disputes Act. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum penalties provided for the various offences under the Trade Disputes Act were last reviewed in 1960. Circumstances have changed over the last two decades. Under the existing provisions, a person found guilty of commencing an illegal strike is subject to a maximum fine of $500 and a person convicted of instigating others to take part in an illegal strike can be fined up to a maximum of $2,000. Offences under the Act are serious offences. The present maximum fines for offences committed under the Act no longer reflect the seriousness of the offences. It is, therefore, necessary to enhance the existing maximum fines. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Teng Cheong]. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>SALARY OF AUDITOR-GENERAL</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name, as it appears on the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> * The motion reads as follows: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to subsection (4) of section 3 of the Audit Act (Chapter 60), resolves that the personal salary of the present holder of the office of Auditor-General, with effect from 1st November 1981, be $6,490 per month, instead of $5,050 per month which is the salary attached to that office. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the salary of the present holder of the post of Auditor-General, who is now on substantive Superscale 'D' grade with a consolidated salary of $5,050 per month, be upgraded to Superscale 'C' at a consolidated salary of $6,490. The present Auditor-General has been extremely diligent in discharging his duties and has shown leadership qualities which have been commented on favourably by the Chairman of our Public Accounts Committee. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey of 26 countries indicates that three of them grade their Auditor-General above their Permanent Secretaries, 21 as comparable and two below. Our Auditor-General has been one step below the minimum grade for substantive Permanent Secretaries.

Cross Street and Church Street will be extended across Telok Ayer Basin to provide this link. It is, therefore, necessary to reclaim those portions of the foreshore and seabed of Telok Ayer Basin as shown coloured green on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 2/81 \", a copy of which is displayed in the Library of this House for the information of hon. Members. The reclamation will also yield about 21.7 hectares of valuable land linking Marina South with the financial belt of Shenton Way and the Golden Shoe Area. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board will undertake the reclamation as agent of the Government, Works on the reclamation, estimated to cost approximately $119 million, will start in January 1983 and are expected to be completed in November 1984. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270). approves the reclamation by Government of those portions of the foreshore and seabed off the Town of Singapore containing an area of approximately 21.7 hectares as shown coloured green on the plan marked \"LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN 2/81\" which is deposited with the Land Office, Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>DEPARTMENTAL TITLES</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name under item 4 in the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> * The Motion reads as follows: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Act (Chapter 53), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be amended by the addition under the headings of \"Old Title or Name of Office\" and \"New Title or Name of Office\" respectively of the following:-- \n  <pre>\r\n  Old Title or Name of Office  New Title or Name of Office\r\n\r\n  Assistant Director           Deputy Director\r\n  (Building Control),          (Development and Building Control),\r\n  Public Works Department      Public Works Department.\r\n</pre> \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Director (Building Control), PWD, currently exercises the powers and duties of the Building Authority under the Building Control Act and the Competent Authority under the Planning Act, respectively.

The change in that part of the title from \"(Building Control)\" to \"(Development and Building Control)\" is necessary to reflect the two main functions of the Division which have resulted from a merger of the Building Control and Development Control Divisions in PWD in 1974. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 3 of the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Act (Chapter 53), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be amended by the addition under the headings of \"Old Title or Name of Office\" and \"New Title or Name of Office\" respectively of the following:- \n  <pre>\r\n     Old Title or               New Title or\r\n    Name of Office             Name of Office\r\n\r\n   Assistant Director          Deputy Director\r\n      (Building Control),         (Development and\r\n      Public Works                Building Control),\r\n      Department                  Public Works\r\n                                  Department.\r\n</pre> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr E W Barker]. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    Adjourned accordingly at Eleven \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    minutes to Five o'clock p.m. to \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    a date to be fixed. \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1981/19811023/19811023-HA-0410281.htm\">list - PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF SAF KEEP-FIT APPARATUS (Cols. 281 - 282)</a> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br>  \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
