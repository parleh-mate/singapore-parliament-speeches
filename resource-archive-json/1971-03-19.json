But there are limitations to  what  we\r\n\r\ncan  do. This is because we are an open economy and\r\n\r\nwe  import  most of our goods which are, therefore,\r\n\r\nsubject to fluctuations in world prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that daily necessities mean food,\r\n\r\nhousing  and  clothing. Let us examine these  three\r\n\r\nbroad groups to find out whether there is any  rise\r\n\r\nin their prices and the reasons for such rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On food, we are self-sufficient only in pork,\r\n\r\npoultry  and eggs; the rest of our foodstuffs  like\r\n\r\nrice,  sugar, fish, fresh vegetables, are imported.\r\n\r\nThe  price of sugar was recently increased by three\r\n\r\ncents  per  kati,  but this was because  the  world\r\n\r\nprice  of  raw sugar went up sharply ---  something\r\n\r\nover  which we have no control. There has, however,\r\n\r\nbeen  a fall in the price of rice recently by  some\r\n\r\nfive  cents a kati. The statistics gathered by  the\r\n\r\nStatistics  Department indicate that 100  per  cent\r\n\r\nSiam  rice was, on the average, 41 cents a kati  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1970  and  was only 36  cents  a  kati  in\r\n\r\nJanuary this year. Because rice forms a large  part\r\n\r\nof  Our budget on foodstuffs, the fall in the price\r\n\r\nof  rice should more than outweigh the rise in  the\r\n\r\nprice of sugar and some other items like bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, foodstuffs are also subject to\r\n\r\nseasonal  fluctuations, especially items like  fish\r\n\r\nand  fresh  vegetables.  The  statistics  seem   to\r\n\r\nindicate  that there is always a rise in the  price\r\n\r\nof foodstuffs at the beginning of the year but that\r\n\r\nthe price will go back to normal towards the middle\r\n\r\nof  the  year.  This  may  be  because  of  festive\r\n\r\nseasons,  like the Chinese New Year and  Han  Raya,\r\n\r\nwhich normally occur at the beginning of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On housing, the statistics collected by the\r\n\r\nStatistics  Department  show  an  increase  of  1.4\r\n\r\npoints   in  1970  over  1969.  This  increase   is\r\n\r\nattributed  to  increases in the  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard  charges and the tax on P.U.B, bills.  There\r\n\r\nis,  of  course, a very sharp rise in  rentals  for\r\n\r\nmiddle-class property. But this should  not  affect\r\n\r\nthe  working class who are well looked after by the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clothing group, the increase is really\r\n\r\nvery  slight  and has occurred in  the  sectors  of\r\n\r\nclothing  material  and made-up garments.  A  large\r\n\r\nportion of these two items is still imported and as\r\n\r\nlong as the sophisticated consumers here still have\r\n\r\na  preference  for imported materials  and  made-up\r\n\r\ngarments  over the locally-manufactured ones,  then\r\n\r\nthey must be ready to pay more for them in view  of\r\n\r\nthe customs duty imposed on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that if we continue to run an\r\n\r\nefficient  port  and  the  ancillary  services  and\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  highly  competitive  market  with  the\r\n\r\nabsence of monopolies, we will continue to buy  the\r\n\r\nbest goods at the cheapest possible price from  any\r\n\r\npart of the world and thus keep to the very minimum\r\n\r\nany possible increase in the cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we have been able, in spite of our open\r\n\r\neconomy, and in spite of the rising trend in  world\r\n\r\nprices,  to  keep  our  cost of  living  relatively\r\n\r\nstable. Our Consumer Price Index showed that  there\r\n\r\nwas only a 0.4 point increase in 1970 over 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For comparative purposes, I have handed out a\r\n\r\ntable* containing a cost-of-living index  compiled\r\n\r\nby the United Nations on eight countries. It may be\r\n\r\ninteresting  for Members to note that the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  in  Singapore has risen only 8.5 points  in\r\n\r\nseven  years, from 100 points in 1963, as the  base\r\n\r\nyear,  to  108.5  in July 1970. And  of  the  eight\r\n\r\ncountries shown, Singapore has the lowest  rate  of\r\n\r\nincrease.  The next lowest increase, for Australia,\r\n\r\nis 23.5 points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*See Appendix, cols. 971-2.)\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1971/19710319/19710319-HA-0300971.pdf\"\">COST OF LIVING INDEX (Cols 971 - 972) </a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

When  the  Minister  of  State\r\n\r\nreceived   the   information  from  these   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries,  he  would have received information  on\r\n\r\nthe increase of salaries at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is this a supplementary question?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  were  told by the Minister of  State  for\r\n\r\nFinance   that   the   Bakers'   Association    had\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with his Ministry and,  as  a  result,\r\n\r\napproval was granted for the increase in the  price\r\n\r\nof  bread.  It  seems that the  approval  was  very\r\n\r\neasily  given.

Mr Yong.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Members for Sembawang,\r\n\r\nAnson  and  Telok  Blangah  have  raised  questions\r\n\r\npertaining  to mail delivery and staffing  problems\r\n\r\nin  our  Postal  Department. The Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nspoke  about  postmen being overloaded  with  work,\r\n\r\ninsufficiency of bicycles and motorcycles, and  the\r\n\r\nprolonged acting appointment of the Chief Inspector\r\n\r\nof  Postmen.  The  Member  for  Telok  Blangah  was\r\n\r\nworried about the high turnover of postal staff and\r\n\r\nthe closed service in the Postal Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a previous session of Parliament, Members will\r\n\r\nrecall  that  the Member for Anson  raised  similar\r\n\r\ncomplaints and, in fact, went so far as to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister should make surprise visits  to\r\n\r\nthe  Postal  Department. It  is  not  usual  for  a\r\n\r\nMinister  to accept such an invitation, because  it\r\n\r\nis  very demoralising to the staff for the Minister\r\n\r\nto  make surprise checks. It is normal courtesy for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to advise the head of the  department\r\n\r\nconcerned  that  he will be at  such  and  such  an\r\n\r\noffice  at  a certain time and to be aware  of  his\r\n\r\npresence. But knowing full well that the Member  is\r\n\r\na  most  respected  retired member  of  the  Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment  staff, that he has the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\nPostal  Department  staff at heart  and  felt  very\r\n\r\nstrongly that certain things have got to be done, I\r\n\r\naccepted  therefore  his  kind  invitation  to   do\r\n\r\nsomething. But I must confess today in this House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  I  was not able to follow up that suggestion,\r\n\r\nalthough I accepted it, because of a certain change\r\n\r\nin circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year, the former Postmaster-General\r\n\r\nsubmitted   his  application  for  retirement.   He\r\n\r\nproceeded  on leave prior to retirement in  October\r\n\r\nlast  year  and  he was succeeded  by  the  present\r\n\r\nacting Postmaster-General at a time when the latter\r\n\r\nwas  still  on  secondment  as  the  Controller  of\r\n\r\nImmigration  in  the Ministry of Home  Affairs.  In\r\n\r\nview  of  this change in the incumbent for the  top\r\n\r\npost  in  the  Postal Department, it would  not  be\r\n\r\nprudent for me to have conducted surprise visits to\r\n\r\nthe Postal Department, and also when the new acting\r\n\r\nPostmaster-General  had  still  to  carry   on   as\r\n\r\nController  of  Immigration for  two  solid  months\r\n\r\nbefore he could officially take full charge of  the\r\n\r\nPostal Department in December last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even before the former Postmaster-General went on leave prior to retirement, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  had  decided officially  to  request  the\r\n\r\nNational Productivity Centre to undertake  a  study\r\n\r\nof  the mail system. The request was made in August\r\n\r\nlast   year   but,  unfortunately,   the   National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Centre was already heavily  committed\r\n\r\nto  other  duties  and  they  could  only  begin  a\r\n\r\npreliminary study in February this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may be interested in a\r\n\r\nbrief  summary  of the findings and recommendations\r\n\r\nof  this preliminary study. I happen to have a copy\r\n\r\nof  the preliminary study in my hands. The N. P. C.\r\n\r\nteam  found  that  the structure  of  the  existing\r\n\r\norganisation   should   be   fully   examined   and\r\n\r\nstreamlined,  and  that the  mail  delivery  system\r\n\r\nshould  be  examined  in view of  mechanisation  in\r\n\r\nplace  of the present manual system, and many other\r\n\r\nimprovements.  Other  procedures  should  also   be\r\n\r\nexamined  and streamlined. Jobs should be evaluated\r\n\r\nto eliminate inequalities. The practice and quality\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommunication  and co-ordination are inadequate  to\r\n\r\nthe present scale of Postal Department's operations\r\n\r\nand  should  be  improved.  Finally,  the  training\r\n\r\nfacilities  were also considered inadequate  for  a\r\n\r\ndepartment as large as our Postal Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary report next recommended that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be a full study and that  the  areas\r\n\r\nthat  should be covered are as follows:  management\r\n\r\nand   organisation   structure,  procedures,   mail\r\n\r\nhandling, parcel branch, inventory control,  filing\r\n\r\nsystems  and  record retention,  sub-post  offices,\r\n\r\ntraining  school, transportation,  job  evaluation,\r\n\r\nregional centres and other development plans.  This\r\n\r\nfull  study is expected to take a year and will  be\r\n\r\nconducted  in stages with a report being  submitted\r\n\r\nat   the  end  of  each  stage  for  approval   and\r\n\r\nimplementation. At the end of the  whole  study,  a\r\n\r\nmaster  report  will  be  submitted.  The  National\r\n\r\nProductivity Centre has indicated that  they  would\r\n\r\ncharge  a  retaining  fee of  $5,000  a  month.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  been in touch with the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance for the necessary financial provision to be\r\n\r\nmade.  When it is approved, it is our intention  to\r\n\r\nask  the N. P. C, to commence the study on the  1st\r\n\r\nof April this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the N. P. C, is already conducting a\r\n\r\nthree-week  course  on  method  study,  layout  and\r\n\r\nmaterial   handling,  and  office  management   and\r\n\r\nmethods   for  21  senior  and  middle   management\r\n\r\nofficers of the Postal Department. The course began\r\n\r\non  the 8th of this month, which is 10 days ago.  A\r\n\r\nfew  of the officers who attended this course  will\r\n\r\nbe   attached  to  the  N.  P.  C, study  team  as\r\n\r\ncounterpart staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, two senior postal officers were\r\n\r\nnominated  to  attend  an  appreciation  course  on\r\n\r\nindustrial engineering organised by the N. P. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will note that the terms of\r\n\r\nreference   of  the  N.  P.  C, study   are   very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and cover both immediate as  well  as\r\n\r\nlong-term requirements. I would be less than candid\r\n\r\nif I were to deny that the study is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong  overdue.  For  it  is true  that  the  Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  unfortunately  remained  basically\r\n\r\nunchanged  for  many decades. I can assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat the forthcoming N. P. C, study is intended  to\r\n\r\nremedy the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Sembawang, Anson and Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah will therefore note that we are fully aware\r\n\r\nof  the problems and have not been idle about these\r\n\r\nmatters.  In  fact, the new Postmaster-General  has\r\n\r\ntaken   immediate   action   to   correct   certain\r\n\r\ninadequacies wherever feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to return to the specific complaints\r\n\r\nraised  by  Members of Parliament  concerning  late\r\n\r\ndelivery and mis-delivery of mail, these things can\r\n\r\nhappen  in any postal service. The volume  of  mail\r\n\r\ntraffic  has increased greatly over the  years.  In\r\n\r\n1969, 219 million items of mail were handled by the\r\n\r\ndepartment  and this has increased to  239  million\r\n\r\nitems last year. Although late deliveries and  mis-deliveries  do happen from time to time,  this,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  is  not  to be taken as  an  excuse.  Mail\r\n\r\ndelivery,  as the Member for Anson is aware,  is  a\r\n\r\ncomplex process. It is not just taking it from here\r\n\r\nand  handing  it  over to the other  person.  Where\r\n\r\npossible,  the Postmaster-General has taken  action\r\n\r\nto   remove   any   shortcomings   with   available\r\n\r\nresources. However, this is one area which  the  N.\r\n\r\nP.  C, will look into, and I have no doubt that the\r\n\r\nsystem  will be considerably improved in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson complained that the postmen\r\n\r\nhave  been overloaded with work and that there  are\r\n\r\nnot  enough  bicycles and motor-cycles  for  speedy\r\n\r\nmail    delivery.   Furthermore,   these   machines\r\n\r\nfrequently  break  down and take  a  long  time  to\r\n\r\nrepair. With regard to the complaint about bicycles\r\n\r\nand  motor-cycles, the department had 328  bicycles\r\n\r\nat  the  close of 1970. Since then 39 new  bicycles\r\n\r\nhave  been purchased, 19 for replacement.  For  the\r\n\r\nnext financial year, a further 56 new bicycles will\r\n\r\nbe  purchased. 42 of which will be for replacement.\r\n\r\nMinor  repairs are now undertaken at nearby bicycle\r\n\r\nrepair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshops instead of being sent as hitherto to the post\r\n\r\noffice  garage. Every little small item  of  repair\r\n\r\nhad  previously to be referred to the  post  office\r\n\r\ngarage instead of being attended to immediately  at\r\n\r\nthe  nearest  bicycle repair shop. This  ensures  a\r\n\r\nquicker return to service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, locally-made bicycles have been\r\n\r\nfound  to  be of very poor quality and  there  were\r\n\r\nfrequent  breakdowns. That is why even the  factory\r\n\r\nhas  closed down! Better quality bicycles  are  now\r\n\r\nbeing  purchased.  I notice that my  colleague  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs is having  a  good  time\r\n\r\nover this subject. He probably has the same problem\r\n\r\n-  too  much  dependence  on poor  locally-produced\r\n\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for motor-cycles, the department has 10\r\n\r\nmachines,  one  bought  in October  1970,  for  the\r\n\r\nPunggol/Tampines area. For the coming  year,  eight\r\n\r\nnew   motor-cycles  will  be  purchased,  five  for\r\n\r\nreplacement and three for new beats for the General\r\n\r\nPost  Office  Express Delivery,  Taman  Jurong  and\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang.  I wish to assure  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  a  review is being undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\nPostmaster-General  with the object  of  increasing\r\n\r\nmotorisation for speedier mail delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the query of the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah that there are 29 postmen  vacancies\r\n\r\nas  at  15th March this year, action is in hand  to\r\n\r\nfill  them. As regards the high turnover of  staff,\r\n\r\nmay I provide some statistics that the position  is\r\n\r\nnot  as  alarming  as put by the Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah? The number of postmen who resigned not for\r\n\r\nlast year but over a period of years, was: for 1967\r\n\r\n- three, for 1968 10, 1969 six, and 1970 - 20. Most\r\n\r\nof  those  who  resigned in 1970 had  less  than  a\r\n\r\nyear's   service  and  they  left  for  alternative\r\n\r\nemployment elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Members of the House may recall that\r\n\r\nlegislation was enacted on the first of this  month\r\n\r\nrequiring the installation of letter boxes in high-rise  buildings. This major step will make for more\r\n\r\nefficient delivery of mails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few other questions raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson upon which I would like to touch.\r\n\r\nHe  mentioned  that the post of Chief Inspector  of\r\n\r\nPostmen has been vacant and left unfilled, and  the\r\n\r\npresent  incumbent has been acting one  year  after\r\n\r\nanother.  This question of filling the post  is  an\r\n\r\nestablishment matter and the procedure  rests  with\r\n\r\nthe  Public Service Commission. If it is  found  by\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Service Commission that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nsuitable  candidate, then there is no  confirmation\r\n\r\nof  the appointment. This is as far as I can go.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not decide who should be the Chief Inspector of\r\n\r\nPostmen.   The  creation  of  more  Postal   Higher\r\n\r\nClerical   Officer   posts  to  enhance   promotion\r\n\r\nprospects for Postal Clerical Assistants is also an\r\n\r\nestablishment matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has supplied\r\n\r\ninformation to the effect that he understands  that\r\n\r\n39  officers  from  the Post Office  Savings  Bank,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be converted into a corporation  soon,\r\n\r\nwill  be reverted to the postal services. He  wants\r\n\r\nme  to confirm whether this is true or false. I  am\r\n\r\nafraid I am not aware of this information. I do not\r\n\r\nknow  where he got his grapevine information  from,\r\n\r\nbut  even  then  this  would  be  an  establishment\r\n\r\nmatter.  Would postal clerks be allowed to transfer\r\n\r\nto  other  departments?  Since  this  is  a  closed\r\n\r\nservice,  again it is an establishment  matter.  My\r\n\r\ncolleague  the Minister for Finance will  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  answer  this at a  later  stage.  Can\r\n\r\nsenior  civil  servants from other  departments  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to  the  Postal  Department?  If   the\r\n\r\ndepartment  is a closed service, I cannot  see  how\r\n\r\nsenior  officers  from other  Ministries  could  be\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the Postal Department.  Can  it  be\r\n\r\nthis  -this  is  an assumption -  perhaps  the  new\r\n\r\nPostmaster-General is assumed to be someone who was\r\n\r\nnot   in  the  Postal  Department,  but  from   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department being  transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nPostal  Department?  This  new  acting  Postmaster-General  has  always been a Postal Department  man,\r\n\r\nbut a request was made for him to be transferred\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  to be the Controller of Immigration at a  time\r\n\r\nwhen it was difficult to find a suitable officer to\r\n\r\nhead this important and strategic post. I must  say\r\n\r\nthat  the senior officers in the Postal Department,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Ministry  of  Communications,  were\r\n\r\nstrongly opposed to his transfer out. I had to over-ride official objection and say, \"We must allow our\r\n\r\nsenior  official  in the Postal  Department  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  this  opportunity to  head  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment.\" I think it reflected great  credit  on\r\n\r\nthe  Postal  Department that  an  officer  in  that\r\n\r\ndepartment was found worthy to head the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment  in another Ministry, and he had  served\r\n\r\nat   least   one  full  year  in  the   Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment. It was only when the substantive holder\r\n\r\nof  the post of Postmaster-General decided that  he\r\n\r\nwanted  to  retire  that  we  had  to  recall  this\r\n\r\nparticular   officer  to  look  after  the   Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment.  I hope, Sir, that I have answered  the\r\n\r\nquestions of the Members to their satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are\r\n\r\none or two issues raised by the Minister to which I\r\n\r\nwould like to make further reference. The first  is\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  the  39  officers  who  will  be\r\n\r\ntransferred from the Post Office Savings Bank  back\r\n\r\nto  the  Post  Office when the Post Office  Savings\r\n\r\nBank  becomes  a  corporation. This information  is\r\n\r\ngathered  from the Memorandum on the  Estimates  of\r\n\r\nRevenue and Expenditure of Singapore on page 28. On\r\n\r\nthe  question of the Post Office Savings Bank being\r\n\r\na  closed  department, the point I raised  was,  is\r\n\r\nthere  an  absolute necessity to  keep  the  Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment  a  closed department? The Minister  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now that a senior official  in  the\r\n\r\nPostal  Department was found suitable to  head  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department and so a request  was  made\r\n\r\nfor him to be transferred there. A similar occasion\r\n\r\nmay  arise  where  junior officers  in  the  Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment  would like to be transferred  to  other\r\n\r\ndepartments.  If such requests are  made,  can  the\r\n\r\nPostal Department entertain them? Could the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal   Clerical  Officers  and  Postal   Clerical\r\n\r\nAssistants  be  transferred  out  from  the  Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment, and the General Clerical Officers go to\r\n\r\nthe Postal Department, making it an open department\r\n\r\ninstead of a closed one?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\ngrateful  to  the  Member  for  Telok  Blangah  for\r\n\r\npointing  out  where  he  got  the  mysterious   39\r\n\r\nofficers. It is true that the information is  found\r\n\r\nin  the Memorandum on the Estimates of Revenue  and\r\n\r\nExpenditure  of  Singapore. Had he  quoted  it,  it\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  easier to  follow  his  line  of\r\n\r\nthinking.  This refers to temporary  staff  because\r\n\r\nthe  Postal Savings Bank is now part of the  Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment. If and when the Savings Bank becomes  a\r\n\r\ncorporation,  those temporary staff who  have  been\r\n\r\nemployed  to  cope  with the  increased  number  of\r\n\r\naccounts in the Post Office Savings Bank will  then\r\n\r\nbecome  part  of the staff of the corporation,  but\r\n\r\nlater on they will be given the opportunity to  opt\r\n\r\neither  to  remain  with  the  Savings  Bank  as  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  organisation or  revert  to  the  Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment. This is just like in accounts where you\r\n\r\nhave  a debit and a credit entry. It is only a book\r\n\r\nentry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the staff in the Postal Department\r\n\r\nmay be given the opportunity to get out of a closed\r\n\r\nservice,  this is a very big issue  and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  the Member really expects me to give him  an\r\n\r\nanswer.  It should really be the privilege  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance, who is  in  charge  of  the\r\n\r\nEstablishment and the Treasury, to give an  answer.\r\n\r\nMay  I just say that I will send the Member's query\r\n\r\nacross to my colleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

He has said  that\r\n\r\nthe Postmaster-General is newly promoted. There are\r\n\r\nmany  Controllers  and  Assistant  Controllers   of\r\n\r\nPosts. What have they been doing in the past? Every\r\n\r\nController  of Posts knows the work of his  branch.\r\n\r\nThey should make recommendations on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also explained to the House about the National Productivity Centre. What I want to ask him is whether the Centre is theoretical or practical. I want to know whether this Centre will go through every loophole and find where the trouble comes from. If we know where the trouble\r\n\r\ncomes from probably the report will be correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was working in the Postal Department when one\r\n\r\nday the Postmaster-General from Kuala Lumpur wanted\r\n\r\nto   come  and  inspect  the  work  of  our  Postal\r\n\r\nDepartment.  What  did  the  department  do?   They\r\n\r\nbrought  manpower to the godown by truck.  The  van\r\n\r\nwas  put  inside the godown. He asked an  assistant\r\n\r\npostman  to carry his bag and put it inside.  \"Very\r\n\r\nnice, there is no hot sun. It is very warm and very\r\n\r\nslow.  You  can go.\" That was how he was to  inform\r\n\r\nthe higher authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister says that it is not his duty and he cannot interfere with the administration of the department. I quite understand what he means, but he must get some information from the department which is under his control. I understand the functions of the Postal Department because I worked\r\n\r\nthere  for  the last 34 years. The senior  officers\r\n\r\nare  always  pressing  the  junior  officers.  They\r\n\r\nalways  sit  peacefully in the office,  putting  on\r\n\r\nrecords  and listening to the music. The worst  hit\r\n\r\nare  the men who go out. May I ask the Minister  to\r\n\r\nlet  one  Assistant  Controller follow  a  delivery\r\n\r\npostman  on one of his bicycle rounds and  see  his\r\n\r\ndifficulties? The Postman's job is a manual one. He\r\n\r\nmust  look after his bicycle, the letters,  parcels\r\n\r\nand  registered articles. All this makes his job  a\r\n\r\nheavy responsibility. Further, if it is raining, he\r\n\r\nmust make sure that his bag -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Is not run over by\r\n\r\na motorcar!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The  provision  of\r\n\r\nrest  days is to grant respite to a worker so  that\r\n\r\nhe  could  be given the opportunity for recreation.\r\n\r\nIf the employees are not given their weekly day off\r\n\r\nas  a  rest  day  for a long period, then,  however\r\n\r\nresponsible the union or the employee may be, it is\r\n\r\nbound  to  lead  to  a deterioration  of  employer-employee relationship, and a demoralisation of  the\r\n\r\nemployee concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsible workers of Telecommunications\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  plight of the  department  in  not\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to  give them time off for  rest  days\r\n\r\nbecause of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   present   staff   shortage.   Although   they\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  difficulty of the department,  how\r\n\r\nlong  can  they go on without doing anything  about\r\n\r\nit?  I  understand that the International Telegraph\r\n\r\nSection of the Telecommunications Department  alone\r\n\r\nowes  the staff a total of 30,000 hours for working\r\n\r\non  rest days and public holidays from June 1969 to\r\n\r\nJanuary  1971.  The department owes the  messengers\r\n\r\n11,500 hours, clerical assistants 5,600 hours,  and\r\n\r\ncounter clerks 1,500 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messengers have been put on duty without a single\r\n\r\nday  of  rest for several weeks at a stretch.  They\r\n\r\nhave  worked for half a year without any rest  days\r\n\r\nor public holidays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the problem of recruiting sufficient\r\n\r\nmessengers, clerical assistants and counter  clerks\r\n\r\nto  cope  with the shortage? These are  not  highly\r\n\r\nskilled personnel. Why have a sufficient number  of\r\n\r\nmessengers,  clerks  and counter  clerks  not  been\r\n\r\nrecruited?  The  employees in the  department  have\r\n\r\nshown  great  patience and understanding  and  have\r\n\r\nbeen hoping that steps will be taken to remedy this\r\n\r\nstate  of affairs. Will the department be  able  to\r\n\r\nmeet  this shortage this year? I doubt it. Although\r\n\r\nabout  100 more clerks and clerical assistants  are\r\n\r\nto  be  recruited, some of these will be  replacing\r\n\r\nstaff  who  will  be retiring this year.  From  the\r\n\r\nEstimates,  I notice that no additional  messengers\r\n\r\nare  to be recruited. How are the messengers  going\r\n\r\nto collect their debt?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister assure me that the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department will repay  the  debt\r\n\r\nit  owes  its  employees, in the form  of  holidays\r\n\r\nearned,  if  not  for the past two years,  then  at\r\n\r\nleast this year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if time off cannot be granted within a\r\n\r\nreasonable  period, the workers must be financially\r\n\r\ncompensated,  as is being done in the non-essential\r\n\r\nservices.  I understand the limitations  placed  on\r\n\r\nthe  department by sections 37 (4) and 41(4) of the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act. Clearly, in the past two years, the\r\n\r\ndepartment   has   encountered   difficulties    in\r\n\r\njustifiably enforcing these two sections of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployment Act by granting days off in substitution\r\n\r\nfor   rest   days   and  public  holidays.   Having\r\n\r\nencountered difficulties, it is up to the  Minister\r\n\r\nto persuade his Cabinet colleagues to amend the two\r\n\r\nsections  of  the  Act  instead  of  continuing  to\r\n\r\nperpetuate an injustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first\r\n\r\nreply  to the remarks made by the Member for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  before  I reply to the Member  for  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir.  I  appreciate his concern over the staffing\r\n\r\nposition in the Telecommunications Department.  May\r\n\r\nI  first  explain why there was such an unfortunate\r\n\r\naccumulation  of time off last year?  Firstly,  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  has experienced a vacancy  position  of\r\n\r\nabout nine per cent during the year. This was at  a\r\n\r\ntime   when  the  work  of  the  Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment was expanding at an unusually high rate.\r\n\r\nIt  is  all  right if there has been  no  increased\r\n\r\ntempo in business. But the activity was as high  as\r\n\r\n22  per  cent in terms of the overall gross revenue\r\n\r\nincome.  This  is a fair yardstick to  measure  the\r\n\r\nprogress   of   a   department.   The   growth   in\r\n\r\ninternational traffic has in fact been spectacular.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the international telephone  traffic\r\n\r\nincreased by 38 per cent. The medium-range maritime\r\n\r\ntelephone service, which includes the offshore  oil\r\n\r\nindustry requirements, went up by 64 per cent,  and\r\n\r\nthe international telex traffic increased by 66 per\r\n\r\ncent.  This is a galloping rate of development.  It\r\n\r\nis  most unusual. In order to satisfy public demand\r\n\r\nto  the  best  of  its  ability  and  with  certain\r\n\r\nreasonably acceptable standards, the department had\r\n\r\nno  alternative  but to cover all vacant  positions\r\n\r\nthrough overtime from the existing staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the provision in the current Estimates\r\n\r\nbefore  the  House and the steps that have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  to increase the staff by  recruitment,\r\n\r\nthere  are good expectations that during the coming\r\n\r\nyear  we should have adequate staff. I did not  use\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"shall\"; I said \"should\".  I  am  always\r\n\r\nhopeful, but things may not happen as we wish.  The\r\n\r\nstaff  will  cover not only all normal requirements\r\n\r\nbut also the expected high\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate. This will also help to wipe  out  the\r\n\r\naccumulation  of time off mentioned by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Telok Blangah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the provision for 1,688 posts in this\r\n\r\nyear's vote represents an increase of 159 posts  or\r\n\r\nten  per  cent over that authorised for the current\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, 104 out of these 159 posts are in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the grade affected by the accumulation\r\n\r\nin  time off, which represents approximately 42,000\r\n\r\nman-hours.  The  total overtime  hours  worked  per\r\n\r\nmonth   is   over  1l,000  and  the   net   average\r\n\r\naccumulation of time off per month is around  1,800\r\n\r\nhours.  The  additional complement  of  staff  will\r\n\r\nenable  present overtime duties to be well  covered\r\n\r\nand  enable time off to be granted while leaving  a\r\n\r\nsufficient  margin for anticipated  traffic  growth\r\n\r\nover the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I am very pleased to say that for the\r\n\r\nfirst   time  the  department  is  well  ahead   on\r\n\r\nrecruitment. The Public Service Commission has just\r\n\r\ncompleted   an   exercise  to  recruit   over   250\r\n\r\nTelecommunications    clerical    assistants    and\r\n\r\ntechnicians. This will wipe out the present vacancy\r\n\r\nposition  as  well as fill the 159  new  posts  now\r\n\r\ncoming  up  for  approval  before  the  House.  The\r\n\r\ndepartment should be able to have a full complement\r\n\r\nof  staff  by  May  this  year.  A  crash  training\r\n\r\nprogramme  is being arranged which will enable  the\r\n\r\nnew  staff  to  be trained and put  into  operating\r\n\r\nposition  some  time in August. It  is  anticipated\r\n\r\nthat  the  long  overdue time off  can  be  granted\r\n\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, it is likely that the 24 vacancies in\r\n\r\nthe vote for telegraph messengers will be filled by\r\n\r\nJune,  by which period time off for messengers  can\r\n\r\nbe granted thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, should our present staffing position\r\n\r\nstill  prove  to be inadequate, it may well  happen\r\n\r\nthat the rate of development will again double what\r\n\r\nit  was last year. We cannot say. It depends on the\r\n\r\nrequirements needed by the commercial  sector.  But\r\n\r\nshould  our  staffing position again  prove  to  be\r\n\r\ninadequate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndespite  all  these efforts to keep pace  with  the\r\n\r\nterrific demand for our services, here again  I  am\r\n\r\npleased  to disclose that there is an understanding\r\n\r\nwith  the Ministry of Finance that we may make  our\r\n\r\napplications  and  that  they  will  be  favourably\r\n\r\nconsidered.  I cannot ask better than that.  It  is\r\n\r\nalmost  like a blank cheque where you just fill  in\r\n\r\nyour  requirements. Of course, this is by means  of\r\n\r\nthe  establishment warrant procedure. This was done\r\n\r\nin  August  last  year when we  were  able  to  get\r\n\r\napproval for an additional 68 posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Member for Telok Blangah has\r\n\r\nexpressed  doubts  that things  will  improve  next\r\n\r\nyear,  I  can assure him that his doubts can,  like\r\n\r\nthe  mist in the hills, disappear as the sun  rises\r\n\r\nhigh up in the sky. Of course, I would like to  say\r\n\r\nthat  I want to express my thanks and gratitude  to\r\n\r\nthe  staff of the Telecommunications Department for\r\n\r\ntheir  loyalty  and  dedicated service  under  such\r\n\r\ntrying conditions. If Singapore is to have a rugged\r\n\r\nsociety,    I    think    the    staff    of    the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department have proved that they\r\n\r\nare  very  rugged to be able to withstand all  that\r\n\r\npressure and stress at the cost of very heavy  time\r\n\r\noff accumulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the Member for Potong Pasir? He\r\n\r\nhas   mentioned  that  there  is  smoke  and  noise\r\n\r\npollution   coming   from  the   Telecommunications\r\n\r\nDepartment.  At the rate that they  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  service to the public,  can  you  blame\r\n\r\nthem? The rate of development is not five per cent,\r\n\r\nwhich  we normally see in advanced countries  which\r\n\r\nare  very prosperous, it is an overall 22 per cent,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  four  times higher than  that  of  other\r\n\r\nadvanced  countries. Tens of thousands of hours  of\r\n\r\ntime  off are being accumulated and they are  still\r\n\r\nhanging  on  to  their jobs to make  Singapore  the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications centre of South-east Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, a complaint was received by our\r\n\r\nMinistry in 1970. I think it was due to a number of\r\n\r\nfactors. We have diesel generators. The head of the\r\n\r\nAnti-Pollution Unit in the Prime Minister's  Office\r\n\r\nhas  replied  to  the complainant  who  is  closely\r\n\r\nassociated  with  the Member for Potong  Pasir.  In\r\n\r\nthis reply, they have said that investigations have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  and  it has been ascertained  that  the\r\n\r\nsmoke  and noise are due to the emergency  stand-by\r\n\r\ndiesel  generators which are being test-run weekly.\r\n\r\nThis  means  that  in case of a general  breakdown,\r\n\r\nthis  generator will carry on in the  meantime.  To\r\n\r\navoid    noise    nuisance,   the    Director    of\r\n\r\nTelecommunications has agreed to  suspend  for  the\r\n\r\ntime  being the test-run of these engines  on  week\r\n\r\ndays  and is trying to reschedule the test runs  on\r\n\r\nSundays. It looks as if the Member for Potong Pasir\r\n\r\nis  working overtime on Saturdays and Sundays  when\r\n\r\nthe  Telecommunications Department are test-running\r\n\r\nand,   therefore,  causing  the  noise   pollution.\r\n\r\nFurther,  the  Senior Mechanical  Engineer,  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department, is taking action  to  abate  the\r\n\r\nsmoke  nuisance  and to dampen the noise  from  the\r\n\r\nengines. So every effort is being made. But  should\r\n\r\nall  these efforts be in vain, it may well be  that\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Potong Pasir will be helping me  to\r\n\r\npersuade the Ministry of Finance to give us  modern\r\n\r\ndiesel engines that will be noiseless and pollution\r\n\r\nfree, for which I will then be most grateful to him\r\n\r\nfor having lodged this complaint in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I wish to inform the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  the department has not kept its promise. They\r\n\r\nare  operating this generator even on week days and\r\n\r\nduring  office hours occasionally. However,  I  beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $19,768,510 for Head 0706 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0707 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0707 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.\r\n\r\n(* The  same  amendment also stood in the  name  of Mr Conceicao.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the present reorganisation of our\r\n\r\nmotor  transport service, the Registry of  Vehicles\r\n\r\nwill  be  expanding its activities. We can  imagine\r\n\r\nthe  amount of work that has to be done.  From  the\r\n\r\nbudget  estimates, we know that the R.O.V, will  be\r\n\r\nsetting up an Enforcement Unit to be manned  by  80\r\n\r\npolice   personnel.  In  addition,   the   existing\r\n\r\nInvestigation  Unit  will  be  strengthened  by  11\r\n\r\nadditional posts of Investigating Officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid that the Registry of Vehicles at\r\n\r\nMiddle  Road  will be overcrowded.  No  wonder  our\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications has to make way and has  his  office\r\n\r\nmoved to City Hall. In order to carry out its  work\r\n\r\nefficiently,  it is important that  the  Government\r\n\r\nexpands  the Registry of Vehicles or builds  a  new\r\n\r\nbuilding   at  another  site.  In  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  for  1971-72,  there  is  provision  for\r\n\r\nbuilding a Motor Vehicle Inspection Centre,  but  I\r\n\r\ncannot   find   any  provision  therein   for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of a new building for the Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles.  In my view, the Registry should  improve\r\n\r\nits  working  efficiency especially  following  the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of our motor transport service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I would like the Minister to consider another suggestion. This is in reference to the memorandum I sent him on the 8th of March with regard to season tickets for bus commuters. This scheme, if accepted by the bus companies, will be appreciated by bus commuters as in the long run,\r\n\r\nit  is  more economical. Furthermore, the work-load\r\n\r\nof  the  bus conductors will be reduced, and  their\r\n\r\nefficiency  will be increased. This  is  the  first\r\n\r\nadvantage.  The second advantage of  having  season\r\n\r\ntickets  is  that  bus  commuters  will  not  throw\r\n\r\ntickets about indiscriminately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  third  advantage is that it is more economical\r\n\r\nespecially  for school children. They  can  save  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  sum  of  money  if  they  buy  season\r\n\r\ntickets.   The  fourth  advantage   is   that   bus\r\n\r\nconductors  will have more time to move  around  to\r\n\r\ncheck  and collect fares from other passengers  and\r\n\r\ntherefore increase the revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister concerned will reply to my\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

It  is  quite  an\r\n\r\nordinary event to watch bus drivers speeding  along\r\n\r\ntheir  routes, and timid drivers like  myself  feel\r\n\r\nsomewhat  despondent when they see the  juggernauts\r\n\r\nthat bus drivers drive exceeding the speed limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect besides speeding is the way the\r\n\r\nbus  drivers  frequently do not attend  to  parking\r\n\r\ntheir  buses  by  the bays when they  come  to  bus\r\n\r\nstops.  There have been many occasions when I  have\r\n\r\nseen  buses parked at a distance of one  lane  away\r\n\r\nfrom the kerb to allow passengers to alight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

May  I\r\n\r\nmention  another offence, and that is inconsiderate\r\n\r\ndriving - bus drivers moving out of their stops  as\r\n\r\nsoon as they stick their hands out, or give signals\r\n\r\nand  move  without paying any attention to  traffic\r\n\r\ncoming  from  behind. I hope that the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications will start an education campaign  so\r\n\r\nthat  bus  drivers  may be able  to  improve  their\r\n\r\nstandard  of  driving and pay  attention  to  these\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Mount-batten, has\r\n\r\nreferred to the reform of the transport service and\r\n\r\nI  hope  that that will result in a reform  of  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Mount-batten, I wish to assure  him\r\n\r\nthat with the reorganisation of our motor transport\r\n\r\nservice,  there  will  also  be  expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nadministrative set-up of the Registrar of Vehicles,\r\n\r\nboth  in  staff  and  in  the building  facilities.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  Member says that  he  does  not  see\r\n\r\nanything  in the Development Estimates, which  will\r\n\r\nbe discussed at a subsequent session of Parliament,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to assure him that it is already  in\r\n\r\nthis  year's  estimates.

It is our hope that after the massive\r\n\r\nreorganisation of bus routes has taken  place  next\r\n\r\nmonth and when there is an adequate number of buses\r\n\r\non the roads to meet the needs of the bus commuting\r\n\r\npublic,  we will proceed to educate the drivers  to\r\n\r\nbe more courteous on the road. At the moment, we do\r\n\r\nhave  a  Public Service Vehicle Training Centre  at\r\n\r\nQueenstown  where the question of courtesy  on  the\r\n\r\nroad,  first aid, etc, instructions are being given\r\n\r\nto  new  bus  drivers  before they  can  get  their\r\n\r\nvocational driving licences. But, of course,  there\r\n\r\nis  this  hard core of drivers now in  service  who\r\n\r\nneed  some education. As everybody who is  involved\r\n\r\nin   education  knows,  we  do  not  get  successes\r\n\r\novernight. We have to be a bit patient. We have  to\r\n\r\ntalk,  persuade and to instruct over  a  period  of\r\n\r\ntime before old habits disappear and new habits are\r\n\r\ncultivated.  I do hope that the Member for  Katong,\r\n\r\nbeing  an  educationist  of  high  calibre  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity   of  Singapore,  can  appreciate   this\r\n\r\nsituation.

Sia Khoon Seong and Ho Kah Leong).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the estimates for Education were $174\r\n\r\nmillion.   This  year  the  estimates   have   been\r\n\r\nincreased  to  $191  million. This  represents  the\r\n\r\nsecond largest item in our total expenditure.  From\r\n\r\nthis we can see that the Government has undoubtedly\r\n\r\npaid  a  great deal of attention to the development\r\n\r\nof  our  education.  There is  no  doubt  that  the\r\n\r\neducational system is vital to our nation building.\r\n\r\nWhether a country is strong or weak depends on  how\r\n\r\nstrong  the  educational system in the country  is.\r\n\r\nEducation will train people in a country to be well\r\n\r\neducated,   highly  cultivated,  and   to   acquire\r\n\r\nknowledge, especially in this era of technology. We\r\n\r\nhave  to  train  a  large  number  of  people  with\r\n\r\nspecialised knowledge so that they can take up  the\r\n\r\ntask  of nation building. Therefore we can see that\r\n\r\nthe  task  of the Ministry of Education  is  indeed\r\n\r\nvery  heavy.  The  Ministry  of  Education  in  its\r\n\r\nimplementation  of policies will have  to  be  very\r\n\r\ncautious.  The  compilation of the syllabuses  will\r\n\r\nhave to be very sound and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomprehensive.  The contents of the textbooks  must\r\n\r\nbe  realistic and tailored especially to the  needs\r\n\r\nof  a  developing country. It is only in  this  way\r\n\r\nthat we can have people well trained for their jobs\r\n\r\nso  that  we  will  not produce a large  number  of\r\n\r\npeople who cannot apply what they have learnt. As a\r\n\r\nmatter  of principle, we are trying to implement  a\r\n\r\nmultilingual  education. We emphasise the  teaching\r\n\r\nof   science   and   technology.   This   is   very\r\n\r\nappropriate.  However,  in  the  implementation  of\r\n\r\npolicies, there have been some anomalies.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause many principals and teachers are faced with\r\n\r\na  great  number of difficulties. I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity to  ask  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  four  oft- recurring questions.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  he will investigate and perhaps remedy  them.\r\n\r\nThe first point is about the changing of textbooks.\r\n\r\nWe  find that there has been some delay. Last  year\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education directed that all primary\r\n\r\nschools should use the textbooks published  by  the\r\n\r\nEducational  Publications  Bureau.  They  were  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  One  and  Primary Three  civic  textbooks.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Minister of State does not  know  the\r\n\r\nones  I  am  referring to. All the primary  schools\r\n\r\nnaturally  followed the directive of the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nbut  when  the schools reopened this year  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst   term,  the  textbooks  published   by   the\r\n\r\nEducational Publications Bureau were not enough for\r\n\r\nall primary schools. Some primary schools could not\r\n\r\nuse  textbooks published by other companies.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  teachers  have  had  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nteaching. Moreover, the pupils have had unnecessary\r\n\r\ndifficulties in learning the lessons.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will investigate this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the Mathematics\r\n\r\ntextbooks in primary schools. A few years  ago  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education directed that  all  primary\r\n\r\nschool  textbooks  in  Mathematics  should  be   in\r\n\r\nEnglish.  At  that  time  we  had  a  shortage   of\r\n\r\nteachers.  Now  we  find that the  students  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand these textbooks. Therefore, the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndecided  to  reverse its decision  on  the  use  of\r\n\r\nEnglish  Mathematics textbooks.  The  question  now\r\n\r\nwhether  to  use  Chinese  or  English  Mathematics\r\n\r\ntextbooks in primary schools is up to the principal\r\n\r\nof  the school concerned to decide. This has caused\r\n\r\nsome  surprise to the principals. I think  this  is\r\n\r\nnot an appropriate thing to do. The Ministry is the\r\n\r\nhighest  authority for making decisions. There  are\r\n\r\nmany  educational experts in the Ministry  who  can\r\n\r\nfind   ways   and   means  of  implementing   these\r\n\r\ndecisions. They must find a solution, practical and\r\n\r\nfeasible,  so  that  all schools  can  follow  this\r\n\r\ndecision.  We  should  not adopt  the  practice  of\r\n\r\nasking the principal to do as he sees fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is whether relief teachers can be\r\n\r\nconsidered for confirmation and absorption into the\r\n\r\npermanent  establishment. We know that many  relief\r\n\r\nteachers are fully qualified and some of them  have\r\n\r\nhad many years of experience in practical teaching.\r\n\r\nI  think  they are fully qualified to  be  absorbed\r\n\r\ninto  the permanent establishment. What is more,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  at the moment  we  are  short  of\r\n\r\nteachers.  If  so,  why do we not  consider  giving\r\n\r\nthese relief teachers normal and permanent status?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to raise is how to\r\n\r\nuse  the  revised  syllabus  for  primary  one  and\r\n\r\nprimary two pupils. According to the policy of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education, they are going to start  in\r\n\r\nthe second term of this year a revised syllabus for\r\n\r\nprimary  one  and primary two. However,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  no  comprehensive plan on  how  to  implement\r\n\r\nthis.  I understand that when some inspectors  went\r\n\r\nto  the  schools  they  asked  the  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers   when  they  could  implement   the   new\r\n\r\nsyllabus, and sometimes they asked whether they had\r\n\r\nalready  implemented  the new  syllabus.  When  the\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers mentioned the difficulties,\r\n\r\nthe  inspectors  did not know  what  to  say.  They\r\n\r\nmerely said. \"Whatever you can do, you do now. What\r\n\r\nyou cannot do, you may do as you please.\" What will\r\n\r\nthe Minister say about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nEducation Minister on 16th March remarked  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse that he would hate to think that teachers  in\r\n\r\nthe  education service are attracted  only  by  the\r\n\r\nsalary  scales.  I am sure that the  Minister  said\r\n\r\nthis more in jest than in seriousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of our present situation, the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  monetary  incentives  should  not  be\r\n\r\ndismissed in such a lighthearted fashion by a  mere\r\n\r\nstatement  of a pious platitude. There  is  nothing\r\n\r\nmore  or nothing less human in the teacher than  in\r\n\r\nany  individual in our society. Teachers,  just  as\r\n\r\nother   individuals  in  our  society,  also   have\r\n\r\npersonal   commitments  and   responsibilities   to\r\n\r\nfulfil. They have families to raise, mouths to feed\r\n\r\nand  homes to look after. All these require  money.\r\n\r\nWhy  should the question of money become \"unchaste\"\r\n\r\nwith teachers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said on 16th March, 1971, in this House, the\r\n\r\nteachers  are beginning to wonder what is happening\r\n\r\nto  the  current negotiations between the Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnions   and  the  Education  Ministry.  The   then\r\n\r\nEducation Minister invited the Teachers' Unions  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate on 1st September, 1970. The first meeting\r\n\r\nbetween the representatives of the Teachers' Unions\r\n\r\nand  officials of the Education Ministry took place\r\n\r\non  10th  October, 1970. Today is the  19th  March,\r\n\r\n1971. The Teachers' Unions have yet to receive  any\r\n\r\nresponse  from  the  Education  Ministry   to   the\r\n\r\nproposals  they  put  up  to  them.  The  Education\r\n\r\nMinister  informed this House on 16th March,  1971,\r\n\r\nthat  his Ministry had made its recommendations  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Finance. I would  like  to  serve\r\n\r\nnotice  on the Finance Minister, who is not present\r\n\r\nhere,  that I will take issue with him on the delay\r\n\r\nthat  his  Ministry  is causing  in  the  teachers'\r\n\r\nnegotiations   when   this  House   considers   the\r\n\r\nestimates  of  his  Ministry in  the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform the Members in this House that\r\n\r\nthe  current  negotiations  between  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnions and the Education Ministry do not deal only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith salary matters. They also deal with a host  of\r\n\r\nother  problems such as the questions of  teachers'\r\n\r\nquota in schools, the relationship between teachers\r\n\r\nand   Ministry   officials   as   well   as   other\r\n\r\nprofessional  problems. Some of the problems  arise\r\n\r\nbecause   of   the   lack  of   communication   and\r\n\r\nconsultation   between   Ministry   officials   and\r\n\r\nteachers.  I  would  therefore  like  to  ask   the\r\n\r\nEducation Minister whether steps will be  taken  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  his  Ministry officials  become  more\r\n\r\ncommunicative  and more amenable  to  the  idea  of\r\n\r\nconsultation with teachers, particularly  with  the\r\n\r\nTeachers'   Unions,  on  matters  of   professional\r\n\r\ninterest and importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I share the sentiments of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Moulmein. As the Minister for Education said on\r\n\r\nthe  16th  of  March in this House, a good  teacher\r\n\r\ndoes   not   take   his  salary   too   much   into\r\n\r\nconsideration. I agree with what he  said,  but  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  forget that teachers  are  also  human\r\n\r\nbeings. Today when the prices of so many goods  are\r\n\r\nincreasing,  the  meagre salaries of  the  teachers\r\n\r\ncannot  catch  up  with such increases.  Therefore,\r\n\r\ntheir  salaries  should be readjusted.  Because  of\r\n\r\ntheir poor working conditions, their morale is low.\r\n\r\nThis  is  also  the cause of some teachers  leaving\r\n\r\ntheir  posts. The Teachers' Unions in  the  various\r\n\r\nlanguage streams submitted their representations to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education some five months ago.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister can give an early reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vote for Education is quite a\r\n\r\nconsiderable sum in our budget. Of course, the  aim\r\n\r\nis to educate the 25 per cent of our population who\r\n\r\nare students to become useful citizens. In order to\r\n\r\nachieve  effectively the purpose of  education,  we\r\n\r\nmust  have a correct and definite education policy.\r\n\r\nBut  our  Education Ministry has been  hesitant  on\r\n\r\nmany issues. Perhaps this is because they have  too\r\n\r\nmuch confidence in the so-called \"experts\". I would\r\n\r\nlike to advise the Minister that when he formulates\r\n\r\nhis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy  he should not just pay heed to the opinions\r\n\r\nof  only a handful of experts, but also give regard\r\n\r\nto   the   opinions  of  those  in   the   teaching\r\n\r\nprofession,  especially the teachers, because  they\r\n\r\nare  the  implementers of education  policies  and,\r\n\r\nbeing closest to the students, they understand  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the students best. But in formulating  its\r\n\r\npolicies  or before carrying out any major reforms,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  has  never  consulted  the  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession. It is only when the policies cannot  be\r\n\r\ncarried  through that the Ministry  gets  in  touch\r\n\r\nwith  the teachers to seek solutions. This attitude\r\n\r\nshould be corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we recognise the fact that teachers are\r\n\r\ncommunicators of knowledge and that they  have  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  professional  qualifications,  we   must\r\n\r\nallow  them  to  carry  out  their  duties  and  he\r\n\r\nresponsible for them only within the scope of their\r\n\r\nduties.  We should not give them too heavy a  work-load. They should be allowed time to carry on  with\r\n\r\ntheir  own studies. We should not give them chores,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  collection of fees  and  filling  up\r\n\r\nendless  forms.  We  should  give  them  reasonable\r\n\r\nworking  conditions and a proper scope of work.  At\r\n\r\nthe moment the allocation of the number of teachers\r\n\r\nto  a  classroom is based on a quota formula -  for\r\n\r\nevery   primary  class  1.1  teachers,  for   every\r\n\r\nsecondary  class 1.25 teachers, and for every  Pre-University  class  1  33 teachers.  This  quota  is\r\n\r\nallocated  according to the school time-table,  and\r\n\r\nresults  in  a  heavy burden on  the  teachers.  In\r\n\r\naddition to this, teachers have homework to correct\r\n\r\nand they are allotted various other duties, such as\r\n\r\nextra-curricular  activities.  All  this  increases\r\n\r\ntheir  workload  beyond the quota  provided.  Thus,\r\n\r\nmany  teachers have to be in school one or two days\r\n\r\nmore    per   week   for   these   extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities. This is not in accordance with the time-table,  and  thus  invalidates  the  quota  system.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  school  principals  allot  teachers  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for various other matters  of  which\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  take  charge. From  these  numerous\r\n\r\nadditional duties, it is clear that the teacher's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkload has gone beyond the staff quota stipulated\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry. This shift system also increases\r\n\r\nthe  work-load  of other teachers, and  it  is  not\r\n\r\nentered   in   the  records  of  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the scope of work of the teachers\r\n\r\nshould  be  properly  defined and  enumerated,  and\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken  to  reduce  the  workload  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers. During the last budget debate I suggested\r\n\r\nthat we should not ask the teachers to complete the\r\n\r\nsame  particulars  of  the students  in  attendance\r\n\r\nregister  every year, and to match these  with  the\r\n\r\ncertificates  or other evidence which  parents  are\r\n\r\nrequired to produce. This wastes too much time  and\r\n\r\ncauses  too  much inconvenience to  all  concerned.\r\n\r\nSince  there  are  12,000 class teachers  involved,\r\n\r\neach  having to spend about six hours on this  job,\r\n\r\nit  will  result in 3,000 working days  in  a  year\r\n\r\nbeing   wasted.  One  year  has  lapsed  since   my\r\n\r\nsuggestion was made, and I would like to know  what\r\n\r\nsteps  the  Minister has taken to  deal  with  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only one last matter to bring up, and that\r\n\r\nis,  the  Government has at long  last  decided  to\r\n\r\nextend medical benefits as from 1st September  last\r\n\r\nyear  to  the  teachers  and  staff  in  the  aided\r\n\r\nschools.  But  members of their families  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  included yet. I hope the Minister can  extend\r\n\r\nthese medical benefits to them soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I seek your permission to speak  now,\r\n\r\nso  that  I  need not speak on the next  amendment*\r\n\r\nlater.

Govindaswamy, Yeo Choo Kok, Ho Kah Leong and Tay Boon Too, Reas as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum be allocated for Head 0801 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1005.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to raise a matter which has existed for more than a decade, and that is the age of retirement of teachers. I would like the Minister for Education to reconsider the question of standardising the age of retirement. Over the past decade there have been a\r\n\r\nlot  of  grievances among teachers  in  Government-aided   schools,  particularly  those  in   Chinese\r\n\r\nschools,  against the difference  in  the  retiring\r\n\r\nage.  Some  teachers are retired at 60 years  while\r\n\r\nothers are retired at 55. Why should there he  this\r\n\r\ndifference?  It  is admitted that  when  a  teacher\r\n\r\nreaches  the age of 55 years, he can apply  for  an\r\n\r\nextension  of  service.  But,  in  spite  of   this\r\n\r\nprivilege, he will still harbour a grievance and  a\r\n\r\nfeeling of injustice, which is understandable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Editorials in the Chinese newspapers have given\r\n\r\npublicity  to this matter and they have spoken  for\r\n\r\nthe Chinese school teachers since the early days of\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of this policy on retiring age.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese School Teachers' Union has also spoken\r\n\r\non it. In fact, the Executive Council of this union\r\n\r\nhas  repeatedly requested the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nto  reconsider this matter. In order to give  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment  to all the language streams of teachers,\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  should  standardise  the   age   of\r\n\r\nretirement at 60, instead of leaving it at  55  and\r\n\r\n60  years  respectively. Over the past  decade  the\r\n\r\nChinese School Teachers' Union has done its best to\r\n\r\nfight against this difference, but the Ministry has\r\n\r\ncontinued  to allow this unreasonable  practice  to\r\n\r\ncarry on. This is beyond my comprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the regulations and practice\r\n\r\nof  education  handed down from the  past  are  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  good or practical for  all  time.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  himself said, on the 16th  of  March,  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  in reply to a question  raised  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  that  the  salary structure  of  school\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  teachers is a very complex  matter\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould be simplified. I am in full agreement  with\r\n\r\nhim on this. But at the same time I would like  to\r\n\r\nappeal to him to standardise the age of retirement\r\n\r\nof  teachers  at  60  years, because  the  present\r\n\r\npractice is a very unreasonable one and should  be\r\n\r\nremoved as early as possible. If it is allowed  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on,  it will create further discontent  and\r\n\r\nwill not benefit our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next topic I wish to raise is the matter of school holidays. Teachers during the school vacation rest, study, or go on a tour in order to enrich themselves mentally. But school principals do not have the good fortune of enjoying a vacation. They have to report for duty\r\n\r\nin  school  even during the school  holidays,  and\r\n\r\nthis amounts to working throughout the whole year,\r\n\r\nand  even  throughout  his  school  working  life.\r\n\r\nAlthough  school principals are allowed  to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  vacation  leave, I would  like  to  ask  this\r\n\r\nquestion: why should it be necessary for  them  to\r\n\r\napply  at all? It is my view that the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation should grant school principals a certain\r\n\r\nnumber  of  days for an annual holiday during  the\r\n\r\nschool  vacation, so that they can  have  time  to\r\n\r\nrelax.  I  do  not think this matter requires  any\r\n\r\nlegislation  or  has to go through any  cumbersome\r\n\r\nprocedure,  nor  does it entail  any  negotiations\r\n\r\nacross  the  table. It is purely an administrative\r\n\r\nmatter  for the Minister for Education to  decide.\r\n\r\nHe  can,  in fact, even announce at any time  what\r\n\r\nprocedure  is  to be adopted in granting  vacation\r\n\r\nleave to school principals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to raise is this. Our\r\n\r\nschool teachers have a very crammed timetable,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jurong has pointed out. They  work\r\n\r\nvery  hard  during school hours, and even  outside\r\n\r\nschool  hours,  such  as engaging  in  extra-mural\r\n\r\nactivities. Therefore, during the school  holidays\r\n\r\nthey  do want to go somewhere for recreation,  but\r\n\r\nthere  is no place in the school for them to carry\r\n\r\nout   legitimate  activities.  Teachers  are   not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  go  to certain places and  there  are\r\n\r\nother places which the teachers themselves ought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  to go. There are moral instructions like  the\r\n\r\nTen  Commandments of Moses in the Holy Bible which\r\n\r\nsay  that  thou shalt not do this, and thou  shalt\r\n\r\nnot  do that! Of course, all these rules are  well\r\n\r\nintended. But it is too much to expect everyone to\r\n\r\nbe  a saint. This is attempting the impossible! No\r\n\r\ndoubt  education  is  a  great  enterprise  and  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the teachers. At this time when\r\n\r\ncivilisation  has  entered  the  space  age,  with\r\n\r\nprogress  and  advancement  constantly   made   in\r\n\r\nvarious  fields,  the  teachers  must  also   keep\r\n\r\nabreast of the times. They need time to learn  new\r\n\r\nthings  in  order  to  be  able  to  teach   their\r\n\r\nstudents.  But,  as  I have pointed  out  earlier,\r\n\r\nthere  is a lack of places for teachers to go  to,\r\n\r\neither  to learn or to relax. When a person  works\r\n\r\nin  a very pleasant and favourable environment, he\r\n\r\nwill be able to make a greater contribution to his\r\n\r\nwork. Therefore, I would like to propose that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  build a Teachers Activity Centre  with\r\n\r\nfacilities, such as a library, a sports stadium, a\r\n\r\nconference  hall, a swimming pool, etc.,  for  the\r\n\r\nteachers  to  enjoy during the school holidays  or\r\n\r\noutside  school  hours. With these facilities  the\r\n\r\nteachers  will  be  able to  indulge  in  physical\r\n\r\nexercise or study. This proposed centre will  also\r\n\r\nprovide a forum for discussion among teachers from\r\n\r\nthe various language streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while we are encouraging our students to meet one another and to live in a common environment, we should also provide similar facilities for the teachers to do so. This is particularly necessary because in the present circumstances teachers from the various language\r\n\r\nstreams  have hardly any opportunity to  meet  one\r\n\r\nanother.  This  is  a  great disadvantage  in  our\r\n\r\npresent education system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, you have one minute more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you. Sir.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Government builds an Activity Centre  for\r\n\r\nteachers from all the various streams to meet,  to\r\n\r\nget in touch with one another, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplay  games, or to discuss matters in common, I  am\r\n\r\nsure  they will be able to learn a lot more on  how\r\n\r\nto  teach.  This is better than taking  part  in  a\r\n\r\nseminar. I do not know if the Minister agrees  with\r\n\r\nme  on  this point. But I would, however,  like  to\r\n\r\npoint   this  out  -that  education  is   a   great\r\n\r\ninvestment and the expenditure on it should only be\r\n\r\nnext  to  defence. Therefore, it is worth while  to\r\n\r\nconsider  building  an  Activity  Centre  for   the\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\neducation  policy of the republic should  be  on  a\r\n\r\nmultilingual basis. I observed a statement  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  of  6th  March,  1971,  by  Mr  K.\r\n\r\nGovindasamy,  a  Colombo  Plan  expert,  where   he\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  need to improve the Tamil  language\r\n\r\neducation  in  Singapore. I  am  pleased  that  our\r\n\r\nMinistry  has replied to his questions. What  I  am\r\n\r\ntrying to bring up for our Minister's consideration\r\n\r\nis   the  Tamil  language  textbooks  used  in  our\r\n\r\nschools.  In spite of the fact that we have  gained\r\n\r\nindependence for five years, I wonder why the Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage text-books\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nused here contain only facts regarding India\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia. The teachings inside the texts  have\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do  with the history of our  republic.\r\n\r\nPersonally,  I feel that the pupils  in  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nstream must also be well informed of the happenings\r\n\r\nin  their  country. Though I have no  objection  to\r\n\r\ntheir learning the history of other countries.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   these   are   two   Tamil   books\r\n\r\n[indicating]  printed  by Manomoney  Villas,  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.  Suppose we have such books  printed  here,\r\n\r\ncan  they  cross the causeway? I wish  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister that question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I hope our Minister will\r\n\r\nconsider is whether he can standardise the uniforms\r\n\r\nused  by  our school children. School badges  alone\r\n\r\nmay  solve the identification problem, if there  is\r\n\r\nany.  I  wish  to  bring  forward  this  suggestion\r\n\r\nbecause   I  notice  that  whenever  a   pupil   is\r\n\r\ntransferred  from  one school to another,  in  most\r\n\r\ncases   he   or  she  has  to  get  new   uniforms.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I feel this is a burden on  the  budget\r\n\r\nof some poor families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also mention that there are teachers who\r\n\r\nare  asked  to  do  jobs which  are  outside  their\r\n\r\nteaching profession such as clerical duties and  so\r\n\r\nforth. In doing so, I feel that the teachers cannot\r\n\r\ndo  their  best  in  carrying  out  their  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession, as their minds are filled with problems\r\n\r\nto solve. This in turn will result in a poor output\r\n\r\nof the students. I wish to ask the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What has the Ministry done to ensure that\r\n\r\nintegration  in  Government schools  is  taking\r\n\r\nplace true to the letter of the word? Does  the\r\n\r\nMinister realize that integration is not  being\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  many schools and  that  quite\r\n\r\noften    principals   of   integrated   schools\r\n\r\nthemselves are not interested in integration?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What does the Ministry of Education intend\r\n\r\nto do to ease the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nload of extra-curricular activities particularly\r\n\r\non  the  Secondary I and II pupils? These pupils\r\n\r\nhave   to  attend  workshop  practice  sessions,\r\n\r\ndomestic  science  classes,  sports  activities,\r\n\r\nuniformed group activities, and participation in\r\n\r\nsocieties. As a result, expenses are incurred on\r\n\r\nbus  fares, food etc, and the children are  also\r\n\r\nbeing  over-strained. I would,  therefore,  urge\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry reconsider  the  matter  and\r\n\r\narrange  these  activities  within  the   normal\r\n\r\nschooling hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the load on extracurricular activities,\r\n\r\nparticularly in connection with watering of plants\r\n\r\nor  gardening (the work of the gardener) be taken\r\n\r\noff the shoulders of the teachers? Or if a teacher\r\n\r\nis appointed to do that job, he should not be asked\r\n\r\nto  take charge of other activities, such as  the\r\n\r\nsupervision of servants (which is the work of the\r\n\r\nprincipals);   the  cleaning  up,  painting   and\r\n\r\nattending to the repairs and maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\nschool building. How are the students to learn from\r\n\r\nthe teachers if the latter are so hard pressed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Has the Ministry any intention of sending\r\n\r\nprincipals  and senior assistants  of  Government\r\n\r\nschools in particular for refresher courses in good\r\n\r\nmanners,  politeness, etiquette, and professional\r\n\r\nethics,  so  that they would not take a  bullying\r\n\r\nattitude  towards their staff, as is  the  common\r\n\r\npractice now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) When the Prime Minister and the Education Minister visited the schools, there was a hive of\r\n\r\nactivities all of a sudden. Can the Minister,  or\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary or the  Director  of\r\n\r\nEducation make occasional spot checks on schools to\r\n\r\nsee that everything is going on smoothly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the above, there are inspectors of\r\n\r\nschools  who are junior in rank to the Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool Principals, and yet they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  detailed  to  check  on  the  schools.  It\r\n\r\nappears  that  the inspectorate  has  become  a\r\n\r\njoke. Inspectors are on a lower grade than  the\r\n\r\nprincipals.  How can they control people  on  a\r\n\r\nhigher grade?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) It is a common sight to see overloaded\r\n\r\nbuses  for  school children. The Minister  must\r\n\r\nlisten to this. Have the police made any checks\r\n\r\non  these bus operators to ensure the safety of\r\n\r\nthe  children? These overloaded buses  carrying\r\n\r\nschool children are a common sight daily in the\r\n\r\nBukit Timah and Dunearn Road areas. I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will have time to answer this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P.

He  has  made the point  that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  unchaste about the question of money  with\r\n\r\nteachers.   This  over-concern  has  succeeded   in\r\n\r\npersuading even me to believe that there might be a\r\n\r\ncertain  unchastity  in  the teaching  profession's\r\n\r\npreoccupation with monetary incentives. I think the\r\n\r\nmost  effective argument in the profession's  claim\r\n\r\nfor  monetary  award is not a relentless  complaint\r\n\r\nagainst  official  inattention,  but  a  relentless\r\n\r\ndemonstration  of  professional expertise.  If  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Moulmein  and  the  Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  can assist in moving the entire profession\r\n\r\nto  achieve  distinctive standards  of  performance\r\n\r\nwithout   allowing  an  over-concern   for   prompt\r\n\r\nattention to monetary claims to cool their  ardour,\r\n\r\nI  am  sure that the awards, if deserving  will  be\r\n\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

This  was   amply   demonstrated\r\n\r\nrecently at the teachers' seminar sponsored by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Teachers' Union from the 27th of February\r\n\r\nto  the 1st of March. The discussions were serious,\r\n\r\nresponsible  and intelligent. I do not dispute  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  whether  or  not  the  teachers   are\r\n\r\ndemonstrating  themselves  in  the  right  way.  My\r\n\r\ngrouse is that the teachers' claims are allowed  to\r\n\r\nbe forgotten because of some inefficient officials,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  Treasury  officials,   who   are\r\n\r\nholding up the matter. This is the point I wish  to\r\n\r\nraise.  I do not think it is over the rationale  of\r\n\r\nwhether the teachers deserve the claims or  not.  I\r\n\r\nam  afraid  this  issue  is  not  receiving  enough\r\n\r\nattention   from  the  people  at  the   top,   and\r\n\r\neverything is being left to the inefficiency,  very\r\n\r\nnarrow,  one-track mind of the Treasury  officials.\r\n\r\nBefore  I sit down, I just want to remark that  the\r\n\r\ntone adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs seems to  be  a  little\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  that  of last  year  when  he  was\r\n\r\nsitting next to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> With your indulgence, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nmake  one  comment on what the Member for  Moulmein\r\n\r\nhas  just said.

As far as I can see, they do not seem to\r\n\r\nagree on anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has complained that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education does not know  what  it  is\r\n\r\ndoing   in  implementing  the  new  syllabus   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, has to tell the principals, \"Do what you\r\n\r\ncan.\"  On  the other hand, we have the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  saying that the officials in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education do not make use of the expertise  and\r\n\r\nthe professionalism of the teachers. There you are.\r\n\r\nYou  have  two of them differing! Who is  right?  I\r\n\r\nwill  go on now and try to answer within the  short\r\n\r\nspace  of  ten  minutes all the queries  raised  by\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will take the queries raised by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang. He asked why  there  was  a\r\n\r\ndelay in the implementation of the syllabus and the\r\n\r\ndistribution  of school textbooks. With  regard  to\r\n\r\nthe textbooks used in former years, I have received\r\n\r\nno  complaints about delay in the implementation of\r\n\r\nthe new syllabus in the primary schools. To use his\r\n\r\nown  words,  he  has  said  that  education  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  factor  in  our  national  life,   since\r\n\r\nthrough education we should be able to educate  our\r\n\r\nyoung  citizens in the skills which we  require  of\r\n\r\nthem in later life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have to give very careful consideration to\r\n\r\nthe  syllabus and the curriculum. And the delay  is\r\n\r\ncaused  by the fact that when I assumed the  duties\r\n\r\nof   the  Minister  for  Education  some  time   in\r\n\r\nSeptember, I asked for a review of the syllabus and\r\n\r\nduring that period we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput up a new one. I would say that we gave it every\r\n\r\nconsideration and were able to bring  out  the  new\r\n\r\nsyllabus  and  new textbooks to be  implemented  in\r\n\r\nJanuary in some instances in a few schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member was not here when the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  for  Education replied to  the  question  on\r\n\r\nrelief  teachers.  Since I have  very  little  time\r\n\r\nleft,  I  will  have  to refer the  Member  to  the\r\n\r\nHansard, [Vol. 30, No. 9, cols. 537-41] and  if  he\r\n\r\nwill  read  carefully the reply given  therein,  he\r\n\r\nwill  know why it is not possible to employ  relief\r\n\r\nteachers  on  a  permanent  basis.  I  think   that\r\n\r\ndisposes of the questions which the Member raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next come to the Member for Moulmein. 1 was\r\n\r\nreally serious when I said that I hoped that it was\r\n\r\nnot only the salary that motivates our teachers.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  it is not, because if it were only  money\r\n\r\nthat  motivates our teachers, we would not be  able\r\n\r\nto  expand the educational service as we have done,\r\n\r\nnor  would we be able to have such quality  in  the\r\n\r\neducational service as we are having now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am most grateful to another ex-teacher in\r\n\r\njoining  in  the  debate and  defending  the  stand\r\n\r\ntaken.  Let me repeat that in December we sent  our\r\n\r\nrecommendations with regard to the  discussions  we\r\n\r\nhad  with the Teachers' Unions on salary scales and\r\n\r\nthe terms and conditions of the teaching service to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Member for Jurong, he said that we\r\n\r\nshould  not listen to experts. Well, I am listening\r\n\r\nto  experts  and  I am listening to principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers who are implementing the policy. There  is\r\n\r\ndialogue  now.  There is dialogue between  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials  and  members  of the  Teachers'  Unions,\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers. I am myself sitting on the\r\n\r\ncommittee which is reviewing the objectives of  our\r\n\r\neducational policy from time to time. So  there  is\r\n\r\nthis  discussion going on and we are trying to  get\r\n\r\nright down to the root of the matter and hope  that\r\n\r\nby doing so the teaching profession will be able to\r\n\r\ndisplay professional excellence in education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

So in no way can we say that  they\r\n\r\nare overworked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as extra-curricular activities are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the Member for Anson made a  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  teachers  should not be  asked  to  undertake\r\n\r\nthese activities. I wonder whether the Member would\r\n\r\nlike  people from outside the schools to  take  the\r\n\r\nschoolboys in football, cricket or scouting.  These\r\n\r\nactivities,   I  would  think,  go  together   with\r\n\r\nteaching, and as far as extra-curricular activities\r\n\r\nare  concerned,  like gardening  and  watering  the\r\n\r\nplants,  we  have  no end of volunteers  among  the\r\n\r\nteachers themselves to lead our boys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to make is that\r\n\r\nin  spite  of  the  fact that our teachers  on  the\r\n\r\naverage  are  given only 18 hours of  work  a  week\r\n\r\ncompared with 22 hours elsewhere, they are, on  the\r\n\r\nwhole, paid very well compared with the salaries of\r\n\r\nteachers elsewhere. If I am not mistaken, they  are\r\n\r\nthe  best-paid teachers in Southeast Asia. In spite\r\n\r\nof that, we are reviewing the conditions of service\r\n\r\nand  the salary structure to see in what way we can\r\n\r\ngive  them that little bit of incentive by bringing\r\n\r\nin  what  the Member for Moulmein has described  as\r\n\r\nbeing  \"unchaste\",  namely, the question  of  money\r\n\r\nincentives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of medical benefits for aided-school staff, they are enjoying the same benefits.\r\n\r\nThe  only  thing now is that there are  not  enough\r\n\r\nwards in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  General  Hospital.

They have  all  been  made\r\n\r\ncommon.  They  retire at the age of 55.  There  are\r\n\r\ncertain  instances under certain regulations  which\r\n\r\nallow  officers to retire at the age of 60. I think\r\n\r\nwe  have  done everything we can to regularise  the\r\n\r\nposition   as  far  as  the  teaching  service   is\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also proposed that Government should\r\n\r\nbuild  a  centre where teachers can  go  and  enjoy\r\n\r\nthemselves. One of the reasons he gave was that  in\r\n\r\nthis  way there would be a place for teachers  from\r\n\r\nall  the language streams to get together and  know\r\n\r\none  another.  I think there are enough  places  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for people of every walk of life  to  go\r\n\r\nand  enjoy themselves. I was very surprised  indeed\r\n\r\nto  hear  from  him  that there  is  a  prohibition\r\n\r\nagainst teachers going to certain places.

But if he goes there every day and becomes\r\n\r\na drunkard, then action will be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member mentioned that there are certain\r\n\r\nplaces  where the teachers themselves would not  go\r\n\r\nand  I would think that a bar is a place where  the\r\n\r\nteachers themselves would not go. As\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfar  as I am aware, there is nothing to prohibit  a\r\n\r\nteacher from enjoying himself in any way he  likes.\r\n\r\nThe only thing is that he must know that he holds a\r\n\r\nresponsible  position as a teacher and is  expected\r\n\r\nto  set  a  good example. Beyond that there  is  no\r\n\r\nprohibition from the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have answered most of the questions raised by Backbenchers. As the Member for Anson has said, since four or five Members have raised so many questions, perhaps there may be one or two which I have missed out. If I have and if there is time and if the Member can repeat the\r\n\r\nquestion or point for clarification, I do not  mind\r\n\r\nanswering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has misunderstood what the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson   was   trying   to  say   about   extramural\r\n\r\nactivities. It is not a question of teachers taking\r\n\r\ncharge of football, scouting or netball. These  are\r\n\r\nthe  normal extramural activities which  they  must\r\n\r\nperform.  That is accepted. What they are  grousing\r\n\r\nabout  is that they have to do things outside their\r\n\r\nnormal  scope of duties; like the savings  campaign\r\n\r\nwhere they have to become postmasters or what  have\r\n\r\nyou.  This  definitely is not within  their  normal\r\n\r\nfunction  even  if they have to take up  extramural\r\n\r\nactivities. Other examples are the health campaign,\r\n\r\nthe  gardening  campaign, and  some  time  ago  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  informed the schools to set  up  advisory\r\n\r\ncommittees where principals must become secretaries\r\n\r\nof committees, and overnight everybody had to start\r\n\r\nlooking  around for about 10 to 12 persons who  are\r\n\r\neducation-conscious  citizens  to  look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of each school. These advisory committees\r\n\r\nhave  to be set up everywhere and the teachers have\r\n\r\nto  serve tea during meetings and things like that.\r\n\r\nThe   point  is  not  extra-mural  activities  that\r\n\r\nnormally should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone   by  teachers.

Among  the  activities\r\n\r\nmentioned  there are some which are  desirable  for\r\n\r\nthe   teachers   as  well  as  for   the   students\r\n\r\nthemselves, for instance, the habit of  saving  and\r\n\r\nmaintaining a beautiful garden. I myself appreciate\r\n\r\ngardens but, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a point  to\r\n\r\nbe  made here, that we do become engrossed in  some\r\n\r\nof  the national campaigns in which we are engaged.\r\n\r\nHere,  I  blame  not so much the enthusiasm  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in pushing these campaigns and  getting\r\n\r\nthe  teachers to help, but the professional experts\r\n\r\nthat we have in the Ministry of Education, because,\r\n\r\nin  trying  to  keep  in  line  with  the  national\r\n\r\ncampaigns,  they  are apt to forget  what  are  the\r\n\r\npriorities  in the Ministry of Education.  If  they\r\n\r\nare  very clear in their minds that those  are  the\r\n\r\npriorities,  that  those are the things  which  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education should be engaged in and they\r\n\r\ngive their professional or expert advice, then  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education would be able to say,  \"Yes,\r\n\r\nbut do we have the time or is it desirable that  we\r\n\r\ndo this and that?\" Once the objective has been set,\r\n\r\nand   the   priorities  have  been  defined,   this\r\n\r\ncomplaint  will  stop. I am going  down  among  the\r\n\r\nteachers,  the  specialists, inspectors  and  trade\r\n\r\nunionists  to find out their views, and  what  they\r\n\r\nthink  should be the objective of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation, and what are the priorities; what we can\r\n\r\ndo and what we cannot do. This is where I want them\r\n\r\nto  speak  up  because once I have  got  all  these\r\n\r\nopinions, we will be able to sit down and  discuss,\r\n\r\nand  we  will  put  right  what  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  is expected to do; what it can  do,  and\r\n\r\ncannot do, and in what way we can help the national\r\n\r\neffort wherever it is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am very glad that the Minister for Education  is\r\n\r\nsincere  in  having a dialogue with  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnions and in hearing from them.

This matter has been raised and answered from time to time in this House, but has remained unsettled outside it. This is the problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  posting  primary  school leavers  to  secondary\r\n\r\nschools.  My  constituency is not  one  where  many\r\n\r\nparents  have chauffeur-driven cars to  take  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  and from school. I notice  that  many\r\n\r\nprimary school leavers in my constituency have been\r\n\r\nposted  to  secondary schools far away  from  their\r\n\r\nhomes  because  of  their poor performance  in  the\r\n\r\nPrimary School Leaving Examination. In many  cases,\r\n\r\nthese  children fared badly because  their  parents\r\n\r\ncould  not provide them with capable private tutors\r\n\r\nto  help  them. Furthermore, they have to  work  to\r\n\r\nhelp  their parents make a living, or they have  to\r\n\r\nwork  in  the  house, such as taking  care  of  the\r\n\r\nyounger  brothers and sisters. As a  result,  their\r\n\r\nstudies  are  not  up  to  the  standard  of  those\r\n\r\nchildren  of  the rich. As such, if we  post  these\r\n\r\npoor  children with poor performance  to  secondary\r\n\r\nschools which are far away from their homes, we are\r\n\r\nin  fact  penalising them for  being  poor.  It  is\r\n\r\nunfair  for the receiving secondary schools,  which\r\n\r\nare  mostly  in  rural  areas,  to  take  in  these\r\n\r\nunfortunate students unless these schools have been\r\n\r\ndesigned   by   the   Ministry  of   Education   as\r\n\r\nsubstandard   schools  to  accommodate   the   weak\r\n\r\nstudents  who are in many cases victims of  poverty\r\n\r\nand  circumstances. If that is the case, we are not\r\n\r\neducating  our  young  ones  but  are,   in   fact,\r\n\r\nclassifying and discriminating against them. I hope\r\n\r\nthis   is  not  the  policy  of  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation.  By  posting  these  poor  children   to\r\n\r\nschools far away from their homes, we are, in fact,\r\n\r\nimposing  psychological and financial  pressure  on\r\n\r\nmany  students  and their parents. This  matter  of\r\n\r\nposting  has become more serious and acute  in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  the Government's intention to allow  the\r\n\r\nbus  fares to go up from the minimum of five  cents\r\n\r\nto ten cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would request the Minister to tell the\r\n\r\nHouse  what steps he is planning to take to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  no  unnecessary hardships on both the parents\r\n\r\nand  the  students are created by  this  policy  of\r\n\r\nposting students to secondary schools far away from\r\n\r\ntheir homes in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir,\r\n\r\nthe purpose of education is to bring up a person to\r\n\r\nbe  a  useful citizen who can contribute to society\r\n\r\nand  the nation. Of course, we should not disregard\r\n\r\nthe  requirements of our realities and bring  up  a\r\n\r\nlot  of people who are of no use to the country  or\r\n\r\nsociety.  Old concepts have already given place  to\r\n\r\nnew concepts. At the moment, we are implementing bi-\r\n\r\nor  tri-lateral education systems. That is to  say,\r\n\r\nwe  have an Arts stream as well as a Science stream\r\n\r\nin   the  academic  system  of  education.  In  the\r\n\r\ntechnical  system of education, we have  vocational\r\n\r\nand  technical streams. This, of course, is of  use\r\n\r\nat  the  present juncture, but if we  classify  the\r\n\r\nsystems  of education too early, that is, make  the\r\n\r\nstudents specialise in certain subjects too  early,\r\n\r\nit  may not be of long-term benefit to them  or  to\r\n\r\nour  country, because we may produce arts  scholars\r\n\r\nwithout  any  knowledge  of science  or  scientists\r\n\r\nwithout any taste for art, or craftsmen without any\r\n\r\nliterary  taste.  We  may produce  some  scientific\r\n\r\n\"Frankensteins\"! So I hope the Ministry will ponder\r\n\r\nover this in their plans at this juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years we have been struggling for a\r\n\r\nrugged society. Therefore, physical education is  a\r\n\r\nvery important subject in schools. Though there are\r\n\r\nabout  15  weeks in a term and every week there  is\r\n\r\none period for physical education, if there are now\r\n\r\nand   then   conferences  on  physical   education,\r\n\r\ntournaments and sports meets and so on  and  P.  E.\r\n\r\nteachers are required to attend to them, how can we\r\n\r\ngive  the students any time for physical education?\r\n\r\nFor  smaller  schools, the students  will  have  no\r\n\r\nproper P.E, lessons throughout the year. How can we\r\n\r\ntrain  our  students  and  bring  out  their   good\r\n\r\nphysical qualities at all? I hope the Minister  can\r\n\r\nremedy this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the compilation of textbooks, since\r\n\r\nthey  are used as a means of teaching, the contents\r\n\r\nand  the form are important, and progressive  steps\r\n\r\nof  learning and other cogent considerations should\r\n\r\nalso be borne in mind.

The contents should be of\r\n\r\na realistic nature, meeting the requirements of the\r\n\r\ntime  so as to attain the ends of education.  Also,\r\n\r\nthe  textbooks should be reasonable  in  price  and\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  changed every year or  allowed  to\r\n\r\nincrease  in  price freely, because that  would  be\r\n\r\ngiving parents an additional financial burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for Delta is aware of the criteria  we  use\r\n\r\nfor posting children to secondary schools, since he\r\n\r\nsays  that although the matter has been raised time\r\n\r\nand time again in this House, nothing has happened.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask him what sort of criteria  he\r\n\r\nwould  use  and,  by using them, whether  he  could\r\n\r\nguarantee  that  there would  be  no  hardship.  No\r\n\r\nmatter  what criteria we use, there would  be  some\r\n\r\nhardship. The only way we can resolve this hardship\r\n\r\nis  to  build a secondary school in every  area  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  let us say about a quarter  of  a  mile\r\n\r\nfrom  each  other. Then we can solve that  problem.\r\n\r\nBut  is this desirable? Is it possible to do  that?\r\n\r\nCan we do that? Therefore, since we cannot do that,\r\n\r\nthe  best  we  can do is to select the criteria  by\r\n\r\nwhich  we  post the students to secondary  schools.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the criteria is that we try to avoid  this\r\n\r\ndifficulty of transport as far as possible so that,\r\n\r\neverything being equal, we would give the  students\r\n\r\na  place  nearest his home. So I will say this:  no\r\n\r\nmatter  what  criteria  we  use,  there  would   be\r\n\r\nhardship among the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education and, therefore,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nhave experts to help me.

I think the Member for Delta must have  read\r\n\r\nsomewhere that the Minister of Defence has  made  a\r\n\r\nrough  analysis and found that most of  the  bright\r\n\r\nstudents  who have won scholarships have come  from\r\n\r\npoor  families. So the criteria that we use do  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  against the poor at all.  The  Member\r\n\r\nwill find that most of the poor children are posted\r\n\r\nto the school of their first choice. So the problem\r\n\r\nwould   arise  among  those  who  can  afford   the\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  that is true, because in one of my meet-the-people  sessions the people who came to see  me  to\r\n\r\nask  for  transfers for their children  were  poor.\r\n\r\nThey  did not want their children to be transferred\r\n\r\nto  schools such as the Toh Tuck School  at  Jurong\r\n\r\nRoad, as it is too far away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, if I remember rightly,\r\n\r\nabout  98  per  cent of these children  were  given\r\n\r\nplaces  of  their first choice.

So unless we have\r\n\r\na set of criteria by which we can reduce the number\r\n\r\nof  disappointed people to below two  per  cent,  I\r\n\r\nthink we will stick to the present criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong was afraid that we might\r\n\r\nask  the students - correct me if I am wrong  -  to\r\n\r\nspecialise  too early. I am not aware of  this.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, he said that we  could  not  have\r\n\r\nrugged citizens if we gave them only one period  of\r\n\r\nphysical exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, perhaps due\r\n\r\nto   the   interpretation,  there  has  been   some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding. What I meant was that because the\r\n\r\nteachers in charge of physical education very often\r\n\r\nare  called  away for meetings or to take  part  in\r\n\r\ncertain  activities, the time  they  have  left  to\r\n\r\nteach   physical   education   is   very   limited.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the students do not have enough time for\r\n\r\nphysical education. In this way, how can we  expect\r\n\r\nthem to become rugged?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, this is more an exception\r\n\r\nthan  the rule.

I would like to avail myself of  this\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  raise  this  question   for   the\r\n\r\nconsideration of the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, concerning the allocation of marks\r\n\r\nfor  extra-curricular  activities,  the  system  of\r\n\r\nmarking was originally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot   quite  reasonable.  Later,  because  of   the\r\n\r\nopinions   advanced   by   the   various   teaching\r\n\r\nprofessions and organisations, this system has been\r\n\r\nimproved  and been found to be more reasonable.  As\r\n\r\nmarks   earned  by  students  for  extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities  may  be  taken into consideration  when\r\n\r\nthey apply for admission to Pre-University classes,\r\n\r\nthey  therefore  pay very great attention  to  this\r\n\r\nsystem   of  marking,  although  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation does not pay too much attention to it.  I\r\n\r\nsay  this because the Ministry has not sent anybody\r\n\r\nto  the  various  schools to see how  these  extra-curricular  activities are carried out or  how  the\r\n\r\nmarking  is  done.  This  invariably  leads  to   a\r\n\r\nsituation  where some schools, in order  to  enable\r\n\r\ntheir  students  to  join  Pre-University  classes,\r\n\r\naward  more  marks to them. This is very  dangerous\r\n\r\nbecause it will lead to anomalies and unfairness. I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister  will  pay  attention  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in many schools there are extra-curricular activities of an academic nature. In\r\n\r\nalmost  every  school there is  a  certain  set  of\r\n\r\ncharacteristics  or features and  these  vary  from\r\n\r\nschool to school. So the students do not know which\r\n\r\none  to choose. And finally when it comes to extra-curricular  periods, you will  find  that  actually\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  being made full  use  of.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause there is no definite scheme or standard set\r\n\r\nby  the Ministry. I hope there can be some guidance\r\n\r\nto  enable  the teachers to know how  these  extra-mural activities should be conducted, and how  they\r\n\r\ncould help them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is about the distribution of work-load in respect of extra-curricular activities.\r\n\r\nThere  are  some teachers who need not have  to  be\r\n\r\nburdened   with   this,  while  others   arc   made\r\n\r\nresponsible  for many such activities. They  cannot\r\n\r\ncomplain to anybody because the right to assign the\r\n\r\nwork  is  in the hands of the principal.  They  can\r\n\r\nonly  stomach this complaint because there  is  the\r\n\r\nconfidential  report on them by  the  principal.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister  will take measures  to  remedy\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of athletics of any country  depends\r\n\r\nmainly on the students' efforts. Whether or not  it\r\n\r\nreaches international standard again depends on the\r\n\r\nstudents themselves. At the present moment,  sports\r\n\r\nand   athletic  activities  in  the   primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  are  directed  by  the   Extra-curricular  Activities Centre of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.   But  from  the  athletic   meets   and\r\n\r\ncompetitions  held  every  year  in   primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools, we find that  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nstudents in physical education and sports seems  to\r\n\r\nhave  declined,  and their performance  is  not  so\r\n\r\nideal  as we would expect it to be. This is because\r\n\r\nthe  officers in charge of implementing the  extra-curricular  activities have not adopted a  positive\r\n\r\nattitude.  They  think that as long  as  they  have\r\n\r\norganised some sports or games for some schools  to\r\n\r\ntake  part  they have discharged their duties,  and\r\n\r\nare  not  worried about the standard of performance\r\n\r\nor results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, the inspectorate in charge\r\n\r\nof  physical  education has divided  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  into districts, each district  with  one\r\n\r\nsports  council and with the school  principals  in\r\n\r\nthe  district  as ex-officio members. Whenever  the\r\n\r\ncouncil meets, these school principals wou1d do all\r\n\r\nthe  talking and planning, leaving out  the  sports\r\n\r\nteachers, who are in actual charge of sports.  They\r\n\r\ncould only sit behind the principals to observe and\r\n\r\nlisten  to  what  their  principals  have  to  say,\r\n\r\ninstead of speaking their minds on the subject with\r\n\r\nwhich  they are more conversant. There is no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  some principals have some knowledge of sports\r\n\r\nand  physical education, but by and large  most  of\r\n\r\nthem  know  very little about it. So if sports  and\r\n\r\nphysical  education is to be left in the  hands  of\r\n\r\nsuch  principals, it is like trying to catch a fish\r\n\r\nup  a tree, i.e., attempting the impossible. Sports\r\n\r\nactivities,  as laid down by the council,  normally\r\n\r\nare  dealt  with superficially, and  the  teachers,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  will  always be  confronted  with  some\r\n\r\ntechnical  problems in the course  of  implementing\r\n\r\nthese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactivities.  As  a  result, the reaction  from  the\r\n\r\nstudents  cannot be properly checked. Each  time  a\r\n\r\nsports meet or some kind of competition is held  in\r\n\r\nany  district, the students who form the spectators\r\n\r\nare  very small in number. Very few would  want  to\r\n\r\nsee  such games or sports meets. It is just a  case\r\n\r\nof   competitors   and  officials  performing   for\r\n\r\nthemselves with hardly any spectators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to take immediate remedial action on this. I feel that only those persons who have knowledge and experience and proper training should be allowed to take charge of physical education and sports activities of the students, and not allow such matters to be put into\r\n\r\nthe  hands of inexperienced school principals. Only\r\n\r\nthen will we be able better to implement cur policy\r\n\r\nin the field of sports and athletic activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\ninteresting to hear from the Member for Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nthat  some teachers are not interested in  sporting\r\n\r\nactivities. I think there is a mission for him,  as\r\n\r\npresident  of  a  teachers' union to  inculcate  an\r\n\r\ninterest  in sporting activities among the teachers\r\n\r\nwhen   he   meets  them.  In  some  way,   he   has\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  the  organisational  set-up   of   a\r\n\r\nschool. When you appoint a man to be a principal of\r\n\r\na  school,  he  is responsible for all  the  school\r\n\r\nactivities.  If  he  is a good principal,  he  will\r\n\r\nchoose   a   man  who  is  experienced  in   E.C.A.\r\n\r\nactivities  to  run  those  activities  and   those\r\n\r\nexperienced  in sports to run sporting  activities.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  we were to make the sports  secretary\r\n\r\nresponsible  for sports activities  in  the  school\r\n\r\nwithout  being  responsible to  the  principal,  we\r\n\r\nwould have a situation when the principal might  be\r\n\r\nholding, let us say, a session in the hall and  the\r\n\r\nsports  secretary might be calling for the students\r\n\r\nto  take part in sporting activities outside. There\r\n\r\nis  more  than  one leader. There are  two  leaders\r\n\r\nthere. So from an organisational point of view,  it\r\n\r\nis   not   desirable  that  the  school's  sporting\r\n\r\nactivities should be run by a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperson who is not responsible to the principal.

For instance, there may well\r\n\r\nbe  a  sports programme where you have a 100 metres\r\n\r\ndash as the first event and the next event will  be\r\n\r\na  400 metres race then you have all the events  in\r\n\r\nshort distance running crammed together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry if I have\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  the Member for Paya Lebar.

Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in the Memorandum on the\r\n\r\nEstimates  of Revenue and Expenditure of Singapore,\r\n\r\nit  is  stated that the deletion of 111  specialist\r\n\r\nteacher  posts,  for  which grade  recruitment  has\r\n\r\nceased,  has resulted in a saving of $1,237,360.  I\r\n\r\npresume  that this reduction is to be  found  under\r\n\r\nthe  three subheads that I have mentioned just now.\r\n\r\nThe  question  is whether there will  be  any  more\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of specialist teachers  from  now  on.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  also  want  to know the  position  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  incumbents  of  these  specialist  teacher\r\n\r\nposts. Have they all retired or have those who  are\r\n\r\nstill in service lost their specialist allowances?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the complaints that we often hear from\r\n\r\nteachers  is  that  there is a  lack  of  promotion\r\n\r\nprospects  in the education service. There  are  no\r\n\r\nopportunities  to move from one grade  to  another.\r\n\r\nThe  teachers  have always claimed  that  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority of them, in fact, about 90 or 95 per  cent\r\n\r\nof  them,  would  begin and  end  their  career  as\r\n\r\nteachers. There is no possibility of even  a  small\r\n\r\nfraction  of them becoming principals or inspectors\r\n\r\nof  schools.  That being the case, it appears  that\r\n\r\nnow  even  the  opportunity for  some  teachers  to\r\n\r\nbecome specialist teachers has been denied. Can the\r\n\r\nMinister   inform  the  House  who  the  specialist\r\n\r\nteachers   were,  and  why  the  posts  have   been\r\n\r\nabolished once and for all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my brief tells\r\n\r\nme  that  the  recruitment of  specialist  teachers\r\n\r\nceased  in 1958. There has been no more recruitment\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecialist teachers since then. Except  for  24  of\r\n\r\nthem, all have left the service. Presumably most of\r\n\r\nthem retired, some may have died, and some may have\r\n\r\njoined other services. The present position is that\r\n\r\n24  of them are in the service. They have not  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  pension nor have they lost their  specialist\r\n\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint that 90 or 95 per\r\n\r\ncent of the teachers begin and end their career  as\r\n\r\nteachers, this is not surprising. There is always a\r\n\r\npyramid in any profession. If the pyramid is put at\r\n\r\na  hundred per cent, you get about ten per cent who\r\n\r\ncan  go  to  the  top. I think that  is  very  good\r\n\r\nindeed.  I do not know how we can make it  possible\r\n\r\nfor  the 90 per cent of the teachers to go  to  the\r\n\r\ntop  of  the  pyramid. I do not think that  in  any\r\n\r\nservice  it is possible for the top of the  pyramid\r\n\r\nto contain 90 per cent of those who join it. As far\r\n\r\nas  I know, there is going to be no recruitment  of\r\n\r\nspecialist  teachers. Anyway, the Teachers'  Unions\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry have been discussing avenues  of\r\n\r\npromotion  and  the  restructuring  of  the  salary\r\n\r\nscales.  Once  the  recommendations  are  accepted,\r\n\r\nthere  will be avenues for promotion for  teachers.\r\n\r\nThe system will be such that in promoting a teacher\r\n\r\nto  become a principal, we do not at the same  time\r\n\r\nlose  a good teacher and gain a bad principal. That\r\n\r\nis  the  principle  on which we will  work  on  all\r\n\r\npromotion schemes. It will be possible for  a  good\r\n\r\nteacher  who really likes teaching and is a  credit\r\n\r\nto the profession to remain as a teacher and yet be\r\n\r\ngiven   recognition.  If  he  is  a  good  teacher,\r\n\r\nprobably  he need not be promoted to be a principal\r\n\r\nor  an  official in the Education Ministry in order\r\n\r\nto  enjoy  a  pay  which  is equivalent  or  almost\r\n\r\nequivalent  to that which a principal and  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials  enjoy.

I  am  not\r\n\r\nquarrelling about that. I thought the Minister said\r\n\r\nthat  in a pyramid you could never have 90 per cent\r\n\r\nof  those in service right at the top. I agree with\r\n\r\nhim entirely on that point, but you do not have  in\r\n\r\nany  service  90 per cent remaining  right  at  the\r\n\r\nbottom  either.  It  must be  a  pyramid  which  is\r\n\r\ncorrectly structured from the base to the  apex.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Ministry acknowledges this fact. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy the Minister himself has said just now that the\r\n\r\nMinistry   is  looking  into  the  possibility   of\r\n\r\nproviding more promotion prospects. If that is  the\r\n\r\ncase, I gladly withdraw this amendment. However, we\r\n\r\nhave to make the pyramid sharper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, if the pyramid is sharper,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be a smaller percentage going  to  the\r\n\r\ntop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I mean broader, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> A pyramid depends upon the base.\r\n\r\nIf  we have a broader base, then we have more  room\r\n\r\nat  the top. But here again it all depends. We have\r\n\r\nabout 17,003 to 18,003 teachers in the service, and\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  expect more than 10 per  cent  to  hold\r\n\r\nreally  high posts. Otherwise we will have so  many\r\n\r\ngenerals and so few soldiers. Anyway, it is in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of Singapore and the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nto  see  that the teachers are relatively satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  their conditions of service. They should have\r\n\r\nenough  of  what has been described as an  unchaste\r\n\r\nsubject -money. At the same time, we must also keep\r\n\r\nour sense of perspective to see that people are not\r\n\r\npromoted  beyond  their  capacity.  We  will   make\r\n\r\navailable  all  avenues  of promotion  commensurate\r\n\r\nwith  their  service.

In his  Ministry,\r\n\r\nfor  example, some principals act for  as  long  as\r\n\r\nthree  years.  I just do not understand  it.

However.  I think  there  are  practical\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in not violating the  provision  and,\r\n\r\nallowing  acting appointments to exceed  more  than\r\n\r\none  year  largely  because of  the  difficulty  of\r\n\r\nfinding the requisite people to fill the posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of filling the posts of\r\n\r\nprincipals  of  primary schools, as  Members  know,\r\n\r\nappointments and promotion exercises  do  not  come\r\n\r\nwithin  the  purview of the Ministry of  Education.\r\n\r\nThis is done by the Public Service Commission.

I think it is because promotion exercises are\r\n\r\nnot   held   regularly.  I  accept  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nexplanation that this matter is outside the purview\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry of Education and  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter for the Public Service Commission. I suppose\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.S.C, which deals with recruitment  and\r\n\r\npromotion  exercises  for the whole  civil  service\r\n\r\nalways  faces the problem of finding  the  time  to\r\n\r\nhave  regular promotion exercises for the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education. In view of this practical difficulty\r\n\r\nand since the Ministry is big and a large number of\r\n\r\npersonnel are involved, like the Police which has a\r\n\r\nseparate  commission dealing with staff matters,  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether the Minister will consider  setting\r\n\r\nup  a separate education service commission dealing\r\n\r\nwith recruitment as well as promotion exercises for\r\n\r\nmembers of the teaching profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a most\r\n\r\nwelcome suggestion which I will consider carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

If Members  will\r\n\r\nrefer  to subhead 1158, they will see that in 1970-71 we had an establishment of 2.223 whereas for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1971-72 we are given an establishment of 2,056.

In the eyes of the Treasury, there should\r\n\r\nbe  a paring down of the number of teachers in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Education.  In  other  words,   they\r\n\r\nestimate that we have too many bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, I would like to take the\r\n\r\nopportunity  also to explain that the  Treasury  do\r\n\r\nhave  a  case in that we are having too many bodies\r\n\r\nin  the  Ministry. This is so if you  consider  the\r\n\r\nsituation  as a whole, but, in actual  fact,  there\r\n\r\nare  not too many bodies for the simple reason that\r\n\r\nthere  has been a terrific expansion in the English\r\n\r\nstream.  We  are very short of teachers there.  But\r\n\r\nthere  has  not  been this expansion  in  the  non-English  streams,  with the  result  that  we  have\r\n\r\nexcess bodies there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these excess bodies in most cases cannot be\r\n\r\nused  to  do the work in the English stream.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult of this, we have to pare down the number. It\r\n\r\nwill  not be that easy to get extension -would like\r\n\r\nthe Member for Paya Lebar to pay close attention to\r\n\r\nthis  -  for  those  who are  due  for  retirement.\r\n\r\nBecause  of the shortage of teachers it  was  quite\r\n\r\neasy  to  get  an extension of three years  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst instance after the retiring age from 55 years\r\n\r\nuntil  58  years.  After that, another  two  years'\r\n\r\nextension, and then a further extension  from  year\r\n\r\nto year till he is 65 years old. But now we are not\r\n\r\ngiven  SO large an establishment, so we have to  be\r\n\r\nvery  careful about giving extension  and  have  to\r\n\r\njustify every post that we fill.

During the past seven years the salaries of Tamil teachers have been brought up to the same level as that of the teachers in the other streams, and the anomalies have been done away\r\n\r\nwith.   During  the  terms  of  the  previous   two\r\n\r\nMinisters  for  Education, much has  been  done  to\r\n\r\nimprove the terms and conditions of service of  the\r\n\r\nTamil teachers. Now I can say that they are more or\r\n\r\nless in parity with their counterparts in the other\r\n\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to point out that there are a few\r\n\r\ndisparities  in  the facilities  allowed  to  Tamil\r\n\r\nteachers as compared with the teachers in the other\r\n\r\nstreams.  Firstly, the retraining of  the  S.S.L.C.\r\n\r\ntrained  teachers  (a term used by  the  Ministry),\r\n\r\nresulting  in  an  increase in  their  standard  of\r\n\r\nteaching  and  their scales of pay.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\ntransfer   of   those  teachers  who  have   G.C.E.\r\n\r\ncertificates  with three credits, including  Tamil,\r\n\r\nto  the  higher scale of service. Thirdly,  to  put\r\n\r\nthese  Tamil  teachers in the scale of $295-925  as\r\n\r\nDivision II officers, and to issue certificates  to\r\n\r\nthem to that effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that these three facilities have\r\n\r\nbeen  accorded to the teachers in the Malay  stream\r\n\r\nbut  not to the Tamil teachers. These three  points\r\n\r\nare the only ones outstanding with the Ministry for\r\n\r\nthe  last few years. I hope the Minister will  look\r\n\r\ninto this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will iron\r\n\r\nout all anomalies where-ever possible.

What is left there is  probably  to\r\n\r\ngive these Tamil teachers the training so that they\r\n\r\nwill be able to obtain the requisite qualifications\r\n\r\nas  their  counterparts in the other streams.  Once\r\n\r\nthat  has been done I am sure they will be accorded\r\n\r\nthe  same  conditions of service.

Last  year  during  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  on  the Institute of Education  Bill,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education talked a great  deal  about\r\n\r\nit. He said that the setting up of the Institute of\r\n\r\nEducation  would  raise the level of  the  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession in Singapore. Today, however, we are sad\r\n\r\nto  note that he is going to reconsider the setting\r\n\r\nup  of  the Institute of Education.

I  hope\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  will  consider  the  question  very\r\n\r\ncarefully.  I would like to ask him whether  he  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  consult  the opinions of  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnions  before he takes the final decision.

For example, Science\r\n\r\nteachers undergoing training have to take a  course\r\n\r\nin  the teaching of the Chinese language, and  vice\r\n\r\nversa.

Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Teachers' Training College has been established\r\n\r\nfor   quite  some  time  now.  It  has   played   a\r\n\r\nsignificant  role in the training of  teachers  and\r\n\r\nthe promotion of education in our country. However,\r\n\r\nit  suffers from a number of shortcomings. I  would\r\n\r\nlike to list the more glaring ones below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the question of the quality of the\r\n\r\nlecturers.  The great majority of the lecturers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Teachers' Training College have never had  any\r\n\r\nexperience  in  teaching in primary  schools.  They\r\n\r\nhave  not  got the faintest idea about the teaching\r\n\r\nmethods to be applied in primary schools. What they\r\n\r\ndo  lecture  on  is  based entirely  on  textbooks.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  they  have  not been  able  to  provide\r\n\r\naccurate  guidance  in the matter  of  teaching  in\r\n\r\nprimary  schools. There are a number  of  lecturers\r\n\r\nwho do have experience in teaching primary schools,\r\n\r\nbut  they  are not qualified because they are  only\r\n\r\ncertificate trained. If we expect these certificate-trained  lecturers to lecture to trainees in  these\r\n\r\ncertificate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclasses,  we  are  barking up the  wrong  tree.  We\r\n\r\ncannot   expect   them   to  have   any   excellent\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the teaching method. When the lecturers\r\n\r\nin education at T.T.C, lecture on teaching methods,\r\n\r\nthey  just  reproduce  blindly  material  from  the\r\n\r\ntextbooks.   They  are  great  in  theorising   and\r\n\r\nshoptalk. But on how to teach a particular  lesson,\r\n\r\nthey are not able to provide any guidance and leave\r\n\r\nthe  trainees to grope in the dark. One can imagine\r\n\r\nwhat results we are going to get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the lack of training in\r\n\r\nprofessional  ethics.  Actually  this  matter   was\r\n\r\nraised  by  me  two  years ago  during  the  budget\r\n\r\ndebate.  I said that the Teachers' Training College\r\n\r\nlacked  a  training course on professional  ethics.\r\n\r\nToday, after two years, we still cannot find such a\r\n\r\ncourse  in the T.T.C. I therefore bring this matter\r\n\r\nup  again so that the Minister can have a good man-to-man talk with the Principal of the T.T.C, if  we\r\n\r\nexpect   our   teachers,  after  completing   their\r\n\r\ntraining, to carry out their duties faithfully,  to\r\n\r\nbe  responsible teachers, and to make sacrifices in\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of education, we must  inculcate  in\r\n\r\nthem a set of professional ethics to enable them to\r\n\r\nunderstand more fully the duties of the teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad to note that the T.T.C, does not\r\n\r\nprovide a training course on professional ethics. I\r\n\r\nthink this is an extreme deficiency. The result  is\r\n\r\nthat  many  teachers, after having completed  their\r\n\r\ntraining and performed their duty, will soon  leave\r\n\r\ntheir  teaching  posts  to  seek  greener  pastures\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  From  this we can see that  the  T.T.C.\r\n\r\nshould  provide  a training course on  professional\r\n\r\nethics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point refers to the in-service\r\n\r\ntraining  courses conducted by the  T.T.C.  1  find\r\n\r\nthat  many of these courses are repeated  over  and\r\n\r\nover  again.  For example, there was this  one-year\r\n\r\ncourse  on  advanced education for  primary  school\r\n\r\nteachers conducted from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1968 to 1969. If we take a look at the syllabus, it\r\n\r\nwould  appear  that the syllabus is very  ambitious\r\n\r\nand  comprehensive. But actually there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nmuch in it. It is quite devoid of any real content.\r\n\r\nIt  merely consists of old material being  modified\r\n\r\nhere and there. It is like putting old wine into  a\r\n\r\nnew  bottle.  There  are some  lecturers  who  know\r\n\r\nnothing  about  the subject they  are  supposed  to\r\n\r\nlecture on. Instead they waffle and beat about  the\r\n\r\nbush  during lectures. They not only waste the time\r\n\r\nof the teachers, but also public funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point I would like to bring up is the\r\n\r\ninequitable  manner in which monetary  rewards  are\r\n\r\nmade.  Some  of  the  in-service  training  courses\r\n\r\nconducted  by  the  T.T.C., for  example,  training\r\n\r\ncourses  on  second-language  teaching  and  music,\r\n\r\ncarry a monetary bonus at the end' of it. Those who\r\n\r\ncomplete the course successfully will either get an\r\n\r\nextra increment, or a bonus of $150, but some  will\r\n\r\nnot  get  anything  at  all.  And  there  are  some\r\n\r\nteachers  who have undergone the same training  and\r\n\r\ndo   the   same  amount  of  teaching  but  receive\r\n\r\ndifferent  treatment. This is extremely unfair  and\r\n\r\nunreasonable.  Although  one  may  argue  that  the\r\n\r\nteacher should always seek to improve himself or to\r\n\r\nimprove his knowledge and methods of teaching,  and\r\n\r\nnot  look forward to monetary rewards, nevertheless\r\n\r\nwe  must treat all teachers alike. If we do want to\r\n\r\ngive  monetary  rewards,  then  all  of  them  must\r\n\r\nlikewise  he  entitled to them.  There  must  be  a\r\n\r\nuniform  principle in granting these rewards.  This\r\n\r\nwill then show that our Government is fair, and  it\r\n\r\nwill  not  give rise to dissatisfaction  among  our\r\n\r\nteachers, which could result in poor performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern methods of education advance each day. If\r\n\r\nwe  expect  the education system of our country  to\r\n\r\nkeep up with the times we have to pay attention  to\r\n\r\nthe training of our teachers. And as a body charged\r\n\r\nwith  the  responsibility of training our teachers,\r\n\r\nthe  T.T.C, suffers from a great number of defects.\r\n\r\nIt is time that the Ministry took remedial measures\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, the Education Minister\r\n\r\nhas  said earlier that he is having second thoughts\r\n\r\nabout   the  establishment  of  the  Institute   of\r\n\r\nEducation. He has quoted the views expressed by  an\r\n\r\nexpert in England about the desirability of setting\r\n\r\nup  such an institution. I think there is a  danger\r\n\r\nof  being  influenced too much by  expert  opinion,\r\n\r\nparticularly  if the expert is a foreigner,  as  he\r\n\r\nwould  probably  be talking in a different  context\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, his opinion might not  necessarily\r\n\r\nbe   correct.  Offhand,  I  would  say   there   is\r\n\r\ndefinitely  a difference in the situation  existing\r\n\r\nin  Singapore as compared with that in  England.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that most of the teachers in  England  are\r\n\r\nqualified in teacher training and are on  a  salary\r\n\r\nscale different from Singapore's, so that there  is\r\n\r\nno  good  reason for them to further their  teacher\r\n\r\ntraining   in   order  to  obtain   the   necessary\r\n\r\nrecognised  qualifications. But in Singapore  there\r\n\r\nis  a  great need to provide non-graduate  teachers\r\n\r\nwith   the   opportunity  to   advance   themselves\r\n\r\nprofessionally. In this respect, it is not  just  a\r\n\r\nquestion of getting them to attend classes  and  so\r\n\r\non,   but  to  give  them  proper  recognition   on\r\n\r\ncompletion of the course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see advantages in having an Institute of\r\n\r\nEducation,  because  this Institute,  for  example,\r\n\r\ncould confer diplomas which could be equated  to  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  degree, and so give these teachers  the\r\n\r\nrecognition   which  graduate  teachers   are   now\r\n\r\nenjoying. The Teachers' Training College,  however,\r\n\r\nis  not  in a position to confer such a degree.  If\r\n\r\nnon-graduate teachers were to go to the  University\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  for example, to  obtain  a  special\r\n\r\nuniversity   degree,   then,   apart   from   their\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  having to compete with  the  school\r\n\r\nleavers, I think they would be faced with  so  many\r\n\r\nother problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My immediate reaction to the British expert's\r\n\r\nopinion, therefore, is that the expert and  we  are\r\n\r\nplaced  in  very different situations.  Perhaps  he\r\n\r\ncould  be  right if we are talking specifically  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the  functions and scope of the Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation should be. And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere could be common agreement on this. But we  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, need not have to have a different\r\n\r\nplan,  contrary to what he has in mind  because  we\r\n\r\ncan  always pattern his recommendations to suit our\r\n\r\nlocal conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I think there is a need to provide\r\n\r\neducational  research facilities  for  teachers  on\r\n\r\nteacher training, methodology, and the like.  These\r\n\r\nresearch  activities must be directed  towards  the\r\n\r\nimprovement  of teaching methods, and I  think  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Education can  take  on  this  extra\r\n\r\nresponsibility which, at this moment, no department\r\n\r\nor  any  section of the Ministry of  Education  can\r\n\r\nundertake  with  authority. So there  are  so  many\r\n\r\nother  benefits which this Institute  can  provide.\r\n\r\nThere  are so many other matters which we have  got\r\n\r\nto   look  into  in  the  context  of  our  present\r\n\r\nsituation. Therefore, before the Minister makes  up\r\n\r\nhis  mind  while  he is having second  thoughts,  I\r\n\r\nthink   there  should  be  more  consultation   and\r\n\r\ndiscussion with the teachers, as there can be a lot\r\n\r\nof other useful views on the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge him to think very carefully, and I\r\n\r\nmust  say that I disagree with him on the  need  to\r\n\r\nhave second thoughts. Perhaps we could sit down and\r\n\r\nfind  out  what kind of Institute of  Education  we\r\n\r\nshould  have,  and  work it out  according  to  the\r\n\r\ncontext. I believe the teachers will be very  happy\r\n\r\nif  we have an institute of Education. It gives the\r\n\r\nfeeling  that teacher education is put  on  a  high\r\n\r\nlevel,  and  I  think this will give  the  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession a sense of pride and professionalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said\r\n\r\njust  now that I have second thoughts and I say  it\r\n\r\nagain  that  I still have second thoughts,  because\r\n\r\nwhile  having  second thoughts we can  discuss  the\r\n\r\npros  and  cons  of the Institute. Except  for  the\r\n\r\nconferment of degrees, there is nothing  which  the\r\n\r\nT.T.C, cannot do that the Institute  of  Education\r\n\r\ncan do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to pose this question to\r\n\r\nMembers   who   are  au  fait  with  the   teaching\r\n\r\nprofession: of the two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntypes  of  degrees,  a  B.A, plus  a  Diploma   of\r\n\r\nEducation and Bachelor of Education, which do  they\r\n\r\nthink is more attractive to the teaching profession\r\n\r\nor  to  those who are going for higher studies?  As\r\n\r\nfar   as   obtaining   better   qualifications   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, there is nothing to prevent non-graduate\r\n\r\nteachers  from  studying for  an  external  degree,\r\n\r\nwhich  means that together with the Certificate  of\r\n\r\nEducation they would be graduate-trained teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to clarify the point about taking\r\n\r\nover  the School of Education in the University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  did not mean \"taking over\".  I  said\r\n\r\nthat  we  would probably assume the role which  the\r\n\r\nSchool  of  Education  is  now  performing,   i.e.,\r\n\r\nawarding a diploma in Education. I have given  this\r\n\r\nsome thought, because in my mind all of us want  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  the  quality  of  our  teachers.  But  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  whether it is best done  through  the\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education, because it would in  a  way\r\n\r\nprohibit  or  would  not  give  the  teachers   the\r\n\r\nmobility which they now have. Supposing we  do  set\r\n\r\nup  the institute of Education on these lines,  and\r\n\r\nask  students to apply. I am very doubtful  whether\r\n\r\nwe  will  have a sufficient number of them to  come\r\n\r\nin,  spend three year~ in the Institute,  come  out\r\n\r\nwith  a B.Ed, degree, and be stuck in the Education\r\n\r\nservice.  As  against this, if  they  go  into  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore, take a BA, degree in three\r\n\r\nyears,  then get into the T.T.C, to do a one year's\r\n\r\ncourse  for a Diploma of Education, they will  have\r\n\r\ngreater  mobility. And knowing how calculating  and\r\n\r\nhow  materialistic the people of Singapore  are,  I\r\n\r\nhave  my  doubts whether the Institute of Education\r\n\r\nwill  attract the number of students that we  want.\r\n\r\nAs  it  is now, we are finding great difficulty  in\r\n\r\nattracting people to the teaching service.  As  for\r\n\r\nupgrading  the  teaching scale, I  think  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  which the T.T.C, cannot do  except,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said,  to  confer degrees, and  that  may  be\r\n\r\npossible later on. We will see whether it is  worth\r\n\r\nwhile to confer this degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I am swayed not only by the\r\n\r\nopinion of the English authority that I have quoted\r\n\r\n-  there  are,  in fact, about six or  seven  other\r\n\r\nauthorities who are very critical of the degree  of\r\n\r\nBachelor of Education conferred in England - but  I\r\n\r\nam  also swayed by the circumstances which  we  are\r\n\r\nnow  in.  If  I remember rightly, the Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation  was conceived at a time when  we  had  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  of teachers. Therefore, the thinking  then\r\n\r\nwas  that  we could bring these teachers  into  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  and  make them specialise  in  teaching.\r\n\r\nAnother  point of view, with which the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong  will agree, is that we must not only  teach\r\n\r\nthe pedagogic aspect of the profession but also the\r\n\r\nsubjects  in  which they want to  teach.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  we  give them education in the subjects  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they  want to teach. If we  just  make  them\r\n\r\nspecialise in the professional aspect, will  we  be\r\n\r\nturning  out the kind of teachers we want? We  have\r\n\r\ntaken  all  these  matters  into  consideration.  A\r\n\r\nbetter course of action now will be to improve  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of lecturing in the T.T.C, and  gradually\r\n\r\nbuild  up  a  professional corps  of  lecturers  in\r\n\r\neducation  who will have an international standing.\r\n\r\nIf by that time we feel that it is really necessary\r\n\r\nto  confer  a  degree in Bachelor of  Education,  a\r\n\r\ndegree in Master of Education or a Doctorate degree\r\n\r\nin  education, it is not too late to do it. But  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment  we should go in more for consolidation\r\n\r\nof existing practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to answer the Member for Jurong. There will,\r\n\r\nof  course, be regular revision of the syllabus and\r\n\r\ncurriculum  in  the T.T.C, to see that  quality  is\r\n\r\nbeing maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has levelled a very\r\n\r\nsweeping criticism not only at the teaching service\r\n\r\nbut  also  at the T.T.C. Let me take up that  point\r\n\r\nfirst. He has not much good to say about the T.T.C.\r\n\r\nEverything there is wrong! I cannot agree with  him\r\n\r\non  this. If the T.T.C, had not been doing  a  good\r\n\r\njob, we would not have been able to expand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe educational service as much as we have done. We\r\n\r\nwould  not have been able within ten years to offer\r\n\r\nevery  child of school-going age a place in  school\r\n\r\nin any language stream which his parents may choose\r\n\r\nfor  him.  Nor  would  we be getting  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nresults we are getting both in the Cambridge Higher\r\n\r\nSchool  Certificate and the School  Certificate.  I\r\n\r\nagree  that there are some shortcomings,  but  they\r\n\r\nare not of such magnitude as he has described them.\r\n\r\nWe will try to plug any loopholes whenever possible\r\n\r\nand we will try to make improvements where needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come now to his other point that there has\r\n\r\nbeen unfairness in giving monetary rewards to those\r\n\r\nwho  have been given special training. Here  again,\r\n\r\nhe  has  probably not examined the cases carefully,\r\n\r\nbecause  it would be very stupid if we were  unfair\r\n\r\nin  the granting of rewards. That would only  bring\r\n\r\ndiscontent.   It  is  not  our  policy   to   cause\r\n\r\ndiscontent by being unfair in implementing policies\r\n\r\nin  the Ministry of Education. The Member for  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  implies that teachers lack dedication.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  very  sweeping statement because  he  cannot\r\n\r\ngeneralise  on the basis of a few teachers.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot fair to the majority of them,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has half a minute\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The good results achieved in the\r\n\r\neducation   service  are  largely  due   to   their\r\n\r\ndedication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  wish to clarify one point.

I can understand him  when\r\n\r\nhe says that the teaching of professional ethics is\r\n\r\nlacking  in  the T.T.C. However, he has  also  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  teachers, after their  training  in  the\r\n\r\nT.T.C.,  have proved to be adequate in professional\r\n\r\nethics.   Since  they  are  already   adequate   in\r\n\r\nprofessional  ethics, why is he  complaining  about\r\n\r\nthe  lack of training in professional ethics in the\r\n\r\nT.T.C.? We cannot adopt a critical attitude towards\r\n\r\nthe  T.T.C., because these trainees have not  shown\r\n\r\nto  be  inadequate.  This goes  to  show  that  the\r\n\r\ntrainees have benefited from their training in  the\r\n\r\nT.T.C. I think his criticism is rather unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIf  these  teachers  already  display  professional\r\n\r\nethics, what else does the Member expect from them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the establishment of an\r\n\r\nInstitute  of Education, the Minister is  going  to\r\n\r\nreconsider  the question and I think  his  decision\r\n\r\nshould  be supported. Although I have not had  long\r\n\r\nexperience  in teaching, I do know something  about\r\n\r\nit.  I  have  some  ideas about  teaching.  On  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  promotion for those in  the  teaching\r\n\r\nservice, I believe that Members will agree with  me\r\n\r\nthat  education  is a process of  advancement.  The\r\n\r\nmost  important  factor is that  the  teacher  must\r\n\r\nunderstand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  subject he is supposed to teach. For  example,\r\n\r\nif  he does not know how to teach history and he is\r\n\r\nnot  familiar with this subject, how can  he  teach\r\n\r\nit?  There used to be a Department of Education  in\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  in which  many  subjects  were\r\n\r\ntaught,  for  instance, the concept  of  education,\r\n\r\nteaching  methods,  the  history  of  teaching   in\r\n\r\nWestern  countries  and other subjects.  I  studied\r\n\r\nsome  of them in my university days. However, after\r\n\r\nthe   reorganisation  of  Nanyang  University,  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Education was  abolished.  I  think\r\n\r\nthere must have been some reason for its abolition.\r\n\r\nWhen  a student selects a subject for study in  the\r\n\r\nuniversity, he will select one which holds out good\r\n\r\nprospects. He must consider what he is going to  do\r\n\r\nafter graduation. Students who study Geography  can\r\n\r\nteach that subject after they have graduated. Those\r\n\r\nwho  have  studied  Chinese can teach  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage  and literature after graduation. However,\r\n\r\ngraduates  in  education are  not  going  to  teach\r\n\r\neducation because the whole process of teaching  is\r\n\r\neducation.  Education is not  a  narrow  field.  As\r\n\r\nsuch,  it  is  not a subject of study  in  schools.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   graduates  from  the   Department   of\r\n\r\nEducation   have  no  scope  for  employment.   The\r\n\r\nimportant  thing is what they have learnt  and  not\r\n\r\nthe degree that they have obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before we take in all the subjects relating to education, or abolish the present system, we have to consider whether it is really necessary to establish an Institute of Education as against the present system. In fact, at the present moment there is still a Department\r\n\r\nof  Education in the University of Singapore. If we\r\n\r\nwish  to  establish an Institute  of  Education  as\r\n\r\noriginally  planned,  there  may  be  a  danger  of\r\n\r\nduplication. This is a matter which requires second\r\n\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the contents of education,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  merits  and  demerits,  these   are\r\n\r\nmatters  on  which I have received divergent  views\r\n\r\nfrom various quarters. We should not be obsessed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the defects in the T.T.C. The T.T.C, itself is\r\n\r\nrun  by  the staff and the principal of the  T.T.C.\r\n\r\nThe people who are concerned with the management of\r\n\r\nthe   T.T.C, are  the  Teachers'  Unions  and  the\r\n\r\nteachers  themselves. They are part and  parcel  of\r\n\r\nthe  T.T.C, tradition. They constitute the  spirit\r\n\r\nand  tradition  of  the T.T.C.  If  there  are  any\r\n\r\nshortcomings in the T.T.C., these will be reflected\r\n\r\non  the teachers themselves. In view of what I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  I believe the leader of the Teachers'  Union\r\n\r\nis  not  quite  right in making such an  accusation\r\n\r\nagainst  the  T.T.C.  In fact,  in  the  past,  the\r\n\r\nTeachers'    Training   College   conducted    many\r\n\r\nactivities   which   were   necessary   under   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances. For example, there were  courses  on\r\n\r\nthe   methods   of  teaching,  the  principles   of\r\n\r\neducation and other such subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were doing what was necessary to inculcate\r\n\r\nthe concept of methodology in the trainee teachers.\r\n\r\nAfter  some  time they would be able to  understand\r\n\r\nthe   theories   and   principles   of   education.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  there  are  other  practical  aspects\r\n\r\nwhich require further development and these must be\r\n\r\ncarried  out by the teachers themselves  in  actual\r\n\r\nteaching  work. This is not the kind of  work  that\r\n\r\nthe  T.T.C, or the Institute of Education  can  do\r\n\r\nwithin  a  short space of two or three  years.  The\r\n\r\nteachers  themselves  must  learn  while  they  are\r\n\r\nteaching.  So teaching must also go with  learning.\r\n\r\nAs  the  Chinese saying has it, you must learn  and\r\n\r\nteach  at  the same time. This is a very  important\r\n\r\naspect  that the teachers who are Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  must take note of. I am sure they will agree\r\n\r\nwith me on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are certain subjects in the T.T.C, which will be of help to our colleagues in the teaching profession. Perhaps during their days in the T.T.C., they were concentrating too much on certain subjects like Geography or Chemistry and did not devote sufficient time to the\r\n\r\neducational  aspects, how to  teach,  for  example.\r\n\r\nThey  did  not do enough research or study  in  the\r\n\r\nmethods of teaching and principles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof education except to devote their time and energy\r\n\r\nto  subject study. There are historical aspects  of\r\n\r\neducation which should be reviewed, e.g, the  study\r\n\r\nof reports on educational development in Singapore.\r\n\r\nMany people have a collection of such reports.  But\r\n\r\nnobody has made a systematic study of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, time is up. Mr Conceicao.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  speak  briefly  on  this  question  of\r\n\r\nethics.  I  am  very well acquainted  with  a  very\r\n\r\nreverend   gentleman  at  the  Teachers'   Training\r\n\r\nCollege. My experience has been that when I call on\r\n\r\nhim to speak on certain matters sometimes connected\r\n\r\nwith education, I have to fight shy of the topic of\r\n\r\nethics  because he is obsessed with this particular\r\n\r\nsubject.  In view of that, I feel that the  ethical\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  our budding teachers  is  in  good\r\n\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of ethics is also a question of the\r\n\r\ncontinuing development of the teacher which is  one\r\n\r\nof    the    responsibilities    of    professional\r\n\r\norganisations. 1 would like to refer, if I may,  to\r\n\r\nthe question which the Minister has asked just now,\r\n\r\nwhether a teacher would prefer a B.A, degree plus a\r\n\r\nDiploma  in  Education  or  only  a  B.Ed, degree.\r\n\r\nPersonally I would have no hesitation whatsoever in\r\n\r\nsaying that certainly a teacher would prefer a B.A.\r\n\r\ndegree plus a Diploma in Education. That is what  I\r\n\r\nhave   too.   I   left   the  teaching   profession\r\n\r\ntemporarily  in  order  to  equip  myself  with  an\r\n\r\nadditional  higher  qualification.  But  will   the\r\n\r\nMinistry consider giving the same opportunities  to\r\n\r\nserving  officers  that  I  had  when  I  had   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  go  to the  University  to  get  a\r\n\r\ndegree? Perhaps some serious thought could be given\r\n\r\nto  this  matter,  because I think  there  are  two\r\n\r\nbenefits in bursaries and scholarships being  given\r\n\r\nto  serving  teachers. One  of  them  is  that  the\r\n\r\nteachers certainly improve themselves. The other is\r\n\r\nthe  presence of so-called mature students  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity. Certainly no one can disagree with  the\r\n\r\nfact that the presence of people who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  from  the work situation into the  University\r\n\r\nadds  a  new  and  more  mature  dimension  to  the\r\n\r\nsituation in the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another solution to this problem -I may be\r\n\r\ntouching  on rather delicate ground here -  is  for\r\n\r\nour   policy  makers  to  think  seriously  of  the\r\n\r\npossibility of providing opportunities for teachers\r\n\r\nand  others  to  prepare part-time  for  University\r\n\r\nqualifications.    At   the   last    seminar    on\r\n\r\nmodernisation which was organised by the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTeachers' Union, this question was brought up again\r\n\r\nand again. I think that serious attention should be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  this  problem, as I have  said,  by  our\r\n\r\npolicy  makers.  If I may voice my  opinion  as  an\r\n\r\nadult  educator, I would say that in  Singapore  we\r\n\r\nare  imaginative enough to be able to seek ways and\r\n\r\nmeans  of making such a provision without incurring\r\n\r\ntoo much financial expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have had a\r\n\r\nvery  professional discussion, and being  the  only\r\n\r\nlayman  around, I am most grateful to  the  Members\r\n\r\nwho  stood up to speak on education. I am glad that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Katong  agrees  that,  given  the\r\n\r\nchoice, most people would go for a B.A, degree plus\r\n\r\na  Diploma in Education. That is one of the reasons\r\n\r\nwhich make me hesitate whether we should set up the\r\n\r\ninstitute  of Education and whether we  would  have\r\n\r\nenough students wanting to join the Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point the Member for Katong brought forth is\r\n\r\nthat  opportunities  should be made  available  for\r\n\r\nteachers to qualify for degrees. I think there  are\r\n\r\nnow avenues for them to do so by taking an external\r\n\r\ndegree  or degrees. Whether it can be done  locally\r\n\r\nor  not will depend very much on the University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  whether  they  would  allow   such\r\n\r\nextramural   studies  to  be   conducted   in   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  itself.  This is a question  which  the\r\n\r\nUniversity authorities should start to think about,\r\n\r\nand  whether  facilities should be made  available.\r\n\r\nOnce they are made available, the problem of having\r\n\r\nmore  avenues for teachers to upgrade their  skills\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqualifications would be temporarily solved.

I had  occasion  recently  to\r\n\r\nwatch  an  E.T.V, programme. This was  designed  to\r\n\r\nillustrate one of Charles Dickens' stories.  I  was\r\n\r\nrather  surprised  to  see  on  the  programme  the\r\n\r\ndepiction of a Yorkshire countryside with plenty of\r\n\r\nsnow  and a Victorian carriage passing through  the\r\n\r\nscene. One swallow does not make a summer, Sir. But\r\n\r\nI  do  think that we should not take it for granted\r\n\r\nthat  our  children  understand  references  to  an\r\n\r\nentirely foreign environment, and that it would  be\r\n\r\nbetter  for  us to take care that we  do  not  just\r\n\r\ninclude  these references without first  explaining\r\n\r\nwhat they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, here again is\r\n\r\nanother  problem which we face, being a  nation  of\r\n\r\ntwo million people and using all the modern aids we\r\n\r\nhave  in  educating our young people. It  would  be\r\n\r\nideal,  of course, if we could project on E.T.V, a\r\n\r\nseries of films which are made in Singapore showing\r\n\r\nscenes  of  Singapore.  But making  films  is  very\r\n\r\ncostly. Besides the cost of the films, we must also\r\n\r\nhave  the  expertise, which is not easily  acquired\r\n\r\nnor is it latent in a lot of people here. As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  it  would  be  ideal if we  could  do  that.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we cannot. We are doing the best  we\r\n\r\ncan.  We  have  limited resources  and  we  have  a\r\n\r\nlimited E.T.V, audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Member for Katong did say that\r\n\r\none  swallow does not make a summer. There are many\r\n\r\nother series of telecasts on E.T.V, where the films\r\n\r\nare  made locally. In this instance, I am sure that\r\n\r\nwhen  a  strange scene like a Yorkshire countryside\r\n\r\nis projected on the screen during. E.T.V, time, the\r\n\r\nteachers are supplied with notes of explanations so\r\n\r\nthat the students, looking at it, will know and try\r\n\r\nto  understand what is happening elsewhere. I would\r\n\r\nlike to repeat that it would be ideal if everything\r\n\r\ncould  be  done  locally. But it  just  cannot  be.\r\n\r\nMoreover, since it is from one of Charles  Dickens'\r\n\r\nstories  it would be a dramatic story and  students\r\n\r\nwho   read   his  books  are  probably  given   the\r\n\r\nbackground  information so  that  if  they  have  a\r\n\r\ncommand of the language and have a good teacher and\r\n\r\na  vivid imagination, they would see the story come\r\n\r\nto life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nreply and 1 beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1281.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we established the National Junior\r\n\r\nCollege  two  years  ago,  we  selected  the   best\r\n\r\nstudents  in our country to be educated  there.  We\r\n\r\nhoped that the cream of our youth would be able  to\r\n\r\nput   up  an  outstanding  performance  under   the\r\n\r\nguidance  of  the  teachers in the National  Junior\r\n\r\nCollege.  However, today we are sadly  disappointed\r\n\r\nby  the fruitless efforts. When the results for the\r\n\r\nHigher  School Certificate were announced, a number\r\n\r\nof  people  who  arc concerned with education  were\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with the results.  The  percentage  o\r\n\r\npasses for these students, who were supposed to  be\r\n\r\nthe  cream of the lot was 93 in the Chinese  stream\r\n\r\nand  only 83 in the English stream. This has  taken\r\n\r\nus by surprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister may defend the National Junior\r\n\r\nCollege and its teachers by saying that the results\r\n\r\nwere  the  best among all the schools in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would like to remind him that the selection\r\n\r\nof  students for the Junior College is very strict.\r\n\r\nThis  is a matter of common knowledge. The students\r\n\r\nwho   apply  for  admission  to  the  College   all\r\n\r\nperformed  very  well in either the Secondary  Four\r\n\r\nexamination  or  the  Cambridge School  Certificate\r\n\r\nexamination  with  an aggregate  of  less  than  12\r\n\r\npoints.  Only students with such excellent  results\r\n\r\ncan  be admitted to the College. Undoubtedly,  they\r\n\r\nwere  among the best of our students. The equipment\r\n\r\nand  facilities at the College are excellent.  They\r\n\r\nhad a quiet environment in which to study. In fact,\r\n\r\nwe  can  say that they had nothing but the best  of\r\n\r\neverything, so that it is not expecting too much if\r\n\r\nthey  secured  very good results. It  should  be  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of course for them to perform very well  in\r\n\r\nthe  H.S.C, examination. Sir, after studying in the\r\n\r\nNational  Junior  College  for  two  years,   their\r\n\r\npercentage  of passes was only 83 per cent  in  the\r\n\r\nEnglish stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago when these students were selected\r\n\r\nfor admission to the National Junior College, their\r\n\r\nparents were very proud of them. Even their friends\r\n\r\nand  relatives held them in high regard. If we look\r\n\r\nat those who have failed in the H.S.C, examination,\r\n\r\nwe   feel  both  surprised  and  sorry  for   them,\r\n\r\nespecially  their  parents. Those  of  us  who  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the cause of education  will  also\r\n\r\nfeel sorry for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a famous philosopher in China, Lao Tze, in one of his famous classics called Tao Ter Chin, said that difficult things are meant to complement the easy ones. The long is meant to be compared with the short. This is a universal truth. In fact, without comparison one cannot see the\r\n\r\ndifference between the difficult and the easy,  and\r\n\r\nbetween  the  long and the short.  It  is  only  by\r\n\r\ncomparison  that  we  begin to see  the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the secondary schools in Singapore, with the\r\n\r\nexception  of  the  National Junior  College,  have\r\n\r\nreceived a directive from the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nwhich  says  that  for admission to  Pre-University\r\n\r\nclasses,  the aggregate for Arts students must  not\r\n\r\nbe  more  than 24 points, and for Science  students\r\n\r\nmust  not  be  more than 25 points. All  those  who\r\n\r\nsatisfy  these  conditions should  be  admitted  if\r\n\r\nthere are vacancies. Although the standards of  the\r\n\r\nstudents are uneven, all of them who satisfy  these\r\n\r\nconditions must be admitted. One could say that  it\r\n\r\nis  like pulling a cow up a tree. Secondary schools\r\n\r\nin  Singapore do not often have the facilities  and\r\n\r\nthe environment anywhere comparable to those of the\r\n\r\nNational  Junior College. They also  have  half-day\r\n\r\nsessions  only,  but  their  pass  rate  has   been\r\n\r\nanything  from  50  per cent to 90  per  cent.  The\r\n\r\nNational    Junior   College   has   an   excellent\r\n\r\nenvironment for study, longer hours of  study,  and\r\n\r\nthe  best student potential, but we regret to  note\r\n\r\nthat  the  results have not been satisfactory.  The\r\n\r\nstudents have not been trying their best.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  principal should be primarily responsible  for\r\n\r\nhis    duty   in   the   planning,   guidance   and\r\n\r\nencouragement of the students. Very often  we  hear\r\n\r\nabout  meetings held by associations and societies.\r\n\r\nWhen  a  new committee is coming in to replace  the\r\n\r\nold  one,  they  pay compliments  to  the  outgoing\r\n\r\npresident or chairman, and praise his qualities  of\r\n\r\nleadership. We can see how important leadership is.\r\n\r\nThe  National  Junior  College  possesses  so  many\r\n\r\nexcellent conditions. It is not an excessive demand\r\n\r\nto expect that the students would perform extremely\r\n\r\nwell. It is out of the warmness of our hearts  that\r\n\r\nwe expect them to do well. We cannot therefore give\r\n\r\ncredit to the principal of the College for the  way\r\n\r\nhe is handling it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention another point, and that\r\n\r\nis  that  the principal in question has  written  a\r\n\r\nletter of recommendation asking a certain secondary\r\n\r\nschool to admit a particular student into his Pre-U\r\n\r\nclass,  although he knew very well that the student\r\n\r\nconcerned did not possess the minimum requirements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecified  by  the Ministry of Education.

Did he expect a 100 per cent pass  in  the\r\n\r\nH.S.C, examination for the Junior College students?\r\n\r\nOf course, the National Junior College is there not\r\n\r\nonly  to  inculcate knowledge in the students,  but\r\n\r\nalso  leadership qualities. May I inform  him  that\r\n\r\nleadership  qualities  do  not  depend  on  passing\r\n\r\nexaminations  only. I have known a  lot  of  people\r\n\r\nwith  First-class honours degrees who do not do  as\r\n\r\nwell when they come to leading a team as people who\r\n\r\nhave   just   a  Third-class  honours  degree.   So\r\n\r\nleadership  does not depend on just the ability  to\r\n\r\nswot   over   facts.  There  are  other  intangible\r\n\r\nqualities which a leader requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to disabuse him of another piece of\r\n\r\nfalse  information which he may have gathered,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is that two years ago the best students  were\r\n\r\ntaken  into the National Junior College. They  were\r\n\r\nthe  best only in the sense that they were the best\r\n\r\namong  those  who applied. So you cannot  say  that\r\n\r\nthey  were the best from all over Singapore,  those\r\n\r\nwith five or six distinctions. Even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngranted that if we take the best, we cannot  expect\r\n\r\na  100  per  cent pass. As I say,  at  the  age  of\r\n\r\nbetween  16  years and 19 years, the boys  and  the\r\n\r\ngirls   pass   through  quite  a  lot  of   changes\r\n\r\nphysically  and mentally, and passing  examinations\r\n\r\ndepends  not only on the principal and the teacher,\r\n\r\nbut  also a lot on the home surroundings and on the\r\n\r\nstudents themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore  I  withdraw my amendment, I would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint   out  to  the  Minister  that  if  he   says\r\n\r\nexaminations  are not important, I would  like  the\r\n\r\nexamination  system abolished so that all  students\r\n\r\ncan  go into secondary schools, and secondary  four\r\n\r\npupils can go into Pre-U classes.

When the H.S.C.\r\n\r\nresults were announced, the National Junior College\r\n\r\nsaid that the students who were admitted to it  had\r\n\r\nan  aggregate of not more than 12 points. They were\r\n\r\nall  Grade One holders.

Technical education\r\n\r\nhas  been  promoted in Singapore and  has  been  in\r\n\r\nexistence  for two years. I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister    whether   its   progress    has    been\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about the workshops in our\r\n\r\nschools. How many schools have their own workshops;\r\n\r\nand  how  many centralised workshops are  there  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?   Are   these  workshops   adequate   to\r\n\r\naccommodate the technical students?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is this: under the vote for\r\n\r\nsubhead 1435 I see that there is only provision for\r\n\r\none  Assistant Inspector of Schools. If  it  is  so\r\n\r\nimportant to have technical education, why is there\r\n\r\na vote for only one Assistant Inspector of Schools?\r\n\r\nDoes  it mean that it is not necessary to supervise\r\n\r\nthese school workshops? Is the provision sufficient\r\n\r\nfor this purpose?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is the in-service graduate\r\n\r\nteachers  who  are being trained at the  moment  as\r\n\r\ntechnical  teachers. During the day  they  have  to\r\n\r\nteach in school and in the evening they have to  go\r\n\r\nfor  training. They complain that the  lessons  are\r\n\r\nrather  burdensome. Certain courses or lessons  are\r\n\r\nnot  quite  suitable.  I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister whether these allegations are really true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that although technical\r\n\r\neducation  has  been  implemented  for  two  years,\r\n\r\nparents  at large still do not understand  what  it\r\n\r\nis. So, many are not willing to send their children\r\n\r\nto  receive  technical education. Is  the  Minister\r\n\r\nprepared  to launch some sort of publicity campaign\r\n\r\nto  enable  the  parents  to  understand  the  true\r\n\r\nmeaning of technical education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong for his observations on technical\r\n\r\neducation, and for affording me the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nanswer   and  clarify  a  few  points,   lest   the\r\n\r\nsignificance of the frequent participation  of  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary and the Political Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for Home Affairs and my  constant\r\n\r\nsilence during the debate may be misinterpreted!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since its establishment two years ago, we are fairly satisfied with the progress made by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical  Education  Department.  Originally   our\r\n\r\ntarget  was  to  have by 1975 one  in  every  three\r\n\r\nsecondary  school leavers vocationally biased.  But\r\n\r\nnow  I  think we will achieve that target by  1973.\r\n\r\nThere are not enough places available for all those\r\n\r\nwho want it, but the capacity is sufficient to meet\r\n\r\nthis   target.  We  have  some  16,000  places   in\r\n\r\nsecondary  technical  schools  and  8,000  in   the\r\n\r\nvocational  institutes for technical education.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish to train more students than necessary\r\n\r\nin  this  respect,  because such graduate  is  less\r\n\r\nflexible than that in the general education stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the facilities which the Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong has asked for, if I recall correctly, we\r\n\r\nhave  some 33 units of centralised workshops, about\r\n\r\n30  schools  with  their own  workshops,  and  nine\r\n\r\nvocational institutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also referred to the provision of\r\n\r\nonly  one  Inspector  of  Schools  for  the  entire\r\n\r\nTechnical  Education Department. I am afraid  there\r\n\r\nis  some  confusion here, and I wish to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular Inspector of Schools is actually\r\n\r\nprovided for the Technical Education Department for\r\n\r\nthe  Vocational  Guidance  Unit.  The  professional\r\n\r\naspects of the workshops and the responsibility for\r\n\r\ninspection   are,  in  fact,  undertaken   by   the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent and the Assistant Superintendent. In\r\n\r\nthe  General  Education  Department,  however,  the\r\n\r\nsystem is slightly different. Here, the work,  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to  inspection  of teachers,  planning  of\r\n\r\ncurricula,    and   drawing   up   the    equipment\r\n\r\nrequirements,  is undertaken by the  Superintendent\r\n\r\nand  Assistant Superintendent, and the  operational\r\n\r\nand  administrative duties are  undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\nAssistant Training Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that clarification, Sir, if you will look\r\n\r\nunder subheads 1433, 1434, 1443 and 1444, you  will\r\n\r\nfind  that  there  is a total of 20 Superintendents\r\n\r\nand  Assistant Superintendents and, under  subheads\r\n\r\n1436  and 1445, a total of eight Assistant Training\r\n\r\nOfficers. This compares very favourably with the 40\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecialist  Inspectors under the General  Education\r\n\r\nDepartment.  Comparing the student population  with\r\n\r\nthe great variety of subjects that are available in\r\n\r\nthe  General Education Department, I think we  have\r\n\r\ndone  fairly well. Of course, we would like to have\r\n\r\nmore such posts if we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point raised by the Member for Jurong\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  possible reduction of work-load  for\r\n\r\nthe   teachers  under  training.  I  think  he  was\r\n\r\nreferring  to  those technical  teachers  who  have\r\n\r\nalready  been  trained in one trade,  and  are  now\r\n\r\nunder  training for a second trade. Sir, I  believe\r\n\r\nall  of  them  are  relieved from  extra-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities.   The  time  required   for   technical\r\n\r\ntraining  is roughly three to six hours  per  week,\r\n\r\nand  this is about the same as that for the  E.C.A.\r\n\r\nload.  However,  if  the Member  has  any  specific\r\n\r\ninstance  where a teacher under technical  training\r\n\r\nis  not relieved of his E.C.A.-load, or if he feels\r\n\r\nthere is a certain unfairness, will he let me  know\r\n\r\nand we will look into it to rectify the situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point raised by him concerns public\r\n\r\nrelations.  In  fact, the Ministry is  thinking  of\r\n\r\ninjecting professionalism in this respect.  We  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  engage  one expert on  public  relations\r\n\r\nunder  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\r\n\r\nproject,  known as Projects Supports  Communication\r\n\r\nwhich undertakes public relations work in order  to\r\n\r\n\"sell\" the department to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather\r\n\r\ninterested  to hear that the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nis  going  to  engage an expert.

I  think  this  is\r\n\r\nbecause there is so much confusion in the Technical\r\n\r\nEducation   Department   that   even   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament do not know where to start. Or it  could\r\n\r\nbe due to the fact that the Department is very well\r\n\r\nrun! But I take it that it is fairly well run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is this. I think there is too much\r\n\r\npreferential treatment, so to speak, being given to\r\n\r\nthe  Technical Education Department as against  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Education Department. Even  the  quota  of\r\n\r\nteachers for technical education is more than  that\r\n\r\nfor  general  education. There is also poaching  of\r\n\r\nteachers from the General Education Department, and\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  transfer of  teachers  to  the\r\n\r\nTechnical Education Department, it has resulted  in\r\n\r\na  shortage  of  teachers in the General  Education\r\n\r\nDepartment. The question I want to ask is this:  in\r\n\r\nthe   light  of  the  limited  resources  and   the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  of  getting  suitable  teachers,  could\r\n\r\nthere  not  be  some kind of check to prevent  this\r\n\r\nover-emphasis  that  is being  given  to  technical\r\n\r\neducation,  because all this is at the  expense  of\r\n\r\ngeneral  education?  I  think  that  whenever   the\r\n\r\nEducation   Ministry  embarks  on  any   particular\r\n\r\nproject, it overdoes things a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all those\r\n\r\nsuggestions raised by the Member for Katong will be\r\n\r\ntaken  into  consideration  when  we  launch   this\r\n\r\nProjects Supports Communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the points raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Moulmein, first of all, it is not quite true to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the quota of teachers for the  Technical\r\n\r\nEducation  Department is more  than  that  for  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Education Department, and therefore  their\r\n\r\nteachers  are  better off. In fact, they  are  not;\r\n\r\nbecause those teaching in the workshops have a much\r\n\r\nheavier load than those teaching in the classrooms.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Technical Education Department started, we had\r\n\r\nto  get  the teachers, and we just could  not  grab\r\n\r\nanyone  from  the street and make him  a  technical\r\n\r\nteacher. The obvious answer was to retrain teachers\r\n\r\nfrom the General Education Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point that we are developing\r\n\r\ntechnical  education  at  the  expense  of  general\r\n\r\neducation, it is not so, Mr Speaker, Sir. There is\r\n\r\nconstant   liaison  between  the  two   departments\r\n\r\nregarding staffing, and we always ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nTechnical Education Department will not develop  at\r\n\r\nthe expense of the General Education Department. In\r\n\r\nfact,  the Ministry is looking into the possibility\r\n\r\nof integrating the two departments into one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the\r\n\r\nMinister of State for his detailed explanation, and\r\n\r\nI beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2109.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to discuss some questions relating\r\n\r\nto Nanyang University under this amendment, We know\r\n\r\nthat  Nanyang University was established at a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  there was a pressing need to imbue the people\r\n\r\nwith  the  spirit  of nation building.  Like  other\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  higher  learning,  the  financial\r\n\r\nposition  of Nanyang University was very  difficult\r\n\r\nin its initial stages. The main source of financial\r\n\r\nsupport  came from the rank and file of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  Thus  the  development  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  has  been  made  under  conditions   of\r\n\r\nfinancial  paucity. Sir, since its  reorganisation,\r\n\r\nthe   Government   has  undoubtedly   given   great\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance  to Nanyang  University;  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the building of a library, the provision\r\n\r\nof  annually  recurrent expenditure and  equipment,\r\n\r\nand  the proposed building of a sports complex. All\r\n\r\nthis  is  concrete evidence to show that Government\r\n\r\nis lending great support to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNanyang  University. Furthermore, a few years  ago,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  also  given  recognition   to\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  degrees,  thus  enhancing  the\r\n\r\nstatus of the University and its graduates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, Nanyang University does not have a\r\n\r\nlong  history behind it. In its initial  stages  it\r\n\r\nhas  to  depend  on  financial  as  well  as  human\r\n\r\nresources to meet its various requirements. But  in\r\n\r\nview  of the greater development programmes  ahead,\r\n\r\nthe  University  needs  more financial  assistance.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  endorse whatever programmes the University\r\n\r\nhas to contribute to the development of society and\r\n\r\nto  nation  building. I must also  pay  tribute  to\r\n\r\nthose   people  who  have  stoutly  supported   and\r\n\r\nsponsored Nanyang University, and to those who have\r\n\r\nbeen   running   around  raising  funds   for   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  to  build  a  college  of  research,  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  college, and a students'  hostel,  etc.\r\n\r\nSir,  on  the  grounds of supporting  the  idea  of\r\n\r\ncultivating  the people of Singapore,  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will lend greater financial support  to\r\n\r\nthe  further  development of Nanyang University.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  will be an asset to Singapore  if  our\r\n\r\nuniversities can turn out all the people  that  our\r\n\r\ncountry  needs. And i hope that Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nwill carefully make use of the funds donated to it,\r\n\r\nbecause  ultimately  these  funds  come  from   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand why many people still have\r\n\r\nthe  pro-foreign thinking with regard  to  tutorial\r\n\r\nstaff.  They  think that \"scholars\" recruited  from\r\n\r\nabroad   must  be  very  good.  I  am  not  against\r\n\r\nrecruiting genuine scholars. However, I  regret  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  recently  certain  unlearned  so-called\r\n\r\nforeign   \"scholars\"  have  come  to   our   higher\r\n\r\ninstitutions of learning to make a living, and they\r\n\r\nare  highly paid. This only results in a  waste  of\r\n\r\nthe taxpayers' money, and the students will suffer.\r\n\r\nI  want to stress that we must encourage more local\r\n\r\npeople  to  fill the key posts in the  Universities\r\n\r\nbecause   only  they  have  a  sense  of   national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  and  loyalty and  thereby  they  can\r\n\r\nreally contribute their best to the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Nanyang University should continue to be a\r\n\r\nnational university with the special characteristic\r\n\r\nthat its graduates are bilingual.

May I clarify that\r\n\r\nappointments of academic and non-academic staff  to\r\n\r\nthe  University  are not made by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation,  but by the Establishment  Committee  of\r\n\r\nthe  Council  of Nanyang University  of  which  the\r\n\r\nchairman  is the Vice-Chancellor of the University.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, there are two Government representatives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho are given directives to see that not only\r\n\r\nexpatriates   but  also  local  staff   are   fully\r\n\r\nqualified  before they are appointed.  Here  again,\r\n\r\nmay  I  stress that it is not possible to fill  all\r\n\r\nthe  posts, nor is it desirable to fill  the  posts\r\n\r\neither  in  Nanyang University or in the University\r\n\r\nof Singapore with purely local staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
