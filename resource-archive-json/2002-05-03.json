Jayakumar) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has asked me to reply on his behalf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may start by recalling that after Senior Minister\r\n\r\nLee's  visit  to KL in September 2001, he wrote to  Malaysian\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister Dr Mahathir to set out the areas of agreement\r\n\r\nand issues which had to be resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 18th October 2001, Dr Mahathir replied to Senior\r\n\r\nMinister indicating, among other things, that Malaysia  might\r\n\r\nend  the  KTM  train  service  in  Johor  Baru  and  was  re-considering  its  proposal to build an undersea  rail  tunnel\r\n\r\nlinking  Johor  and  Singapore and a bridge  to  replace  the\r\n\r\nCauseway.   As  this  was  a  departure  from  their  earlier\r\n\r\ndiscussion in Kuala Lumpur, Senior Minister Lee wrote  to  Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir  on  10th  December 2001 to seek clarification.   We\r\n\r\nrequested  Malaysia to set out its position  on  the  various\r\n\r\nissues  so  that  there would be a clear  framework  for  the\r\n\r\nofficials,  led  by the two Foreign Ministers,  to  meet  and\r\n\r\ndiscuss the details.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4th March 2002, Dr Mahathir replied to Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  Lee  enclosing Malaysia's latest proposals  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious issues, including the price of water.  Some of  these\r\n\r\nproposals  were completely new and different  from  what  had\r\n\r\nbeen  discussed  during the meetings between Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nLee  and Dr Mahathir and in previous correspondence.   Senior\r\n\r\nMinister Lee replied on 11th March 2002 that Singapore needed\r\n\r\nsome  time  to  study the new Malaysian proposals  and  their\r\n\r\nimplications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th April 2002, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong wrote\r\n\r\nto Dr Mahathir to set out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore's responses to the Malaysian proposals.   The  next\r\n\r\nstep  would  be  for the officials, led by  the  two  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters, to meet in Kuala Lumpur at a mutually agreed  date\r\n\r\nto  discuss  the  details.  I have written to my  counterpart\r\n\r\nForeign Minister Syed Hamid proposing a set of dates for this\r\n\r\nmeeting.  I am awaiting his reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in Parliament last September, that is, the\r\n\r\nprevious  Parliament,  Singapore believes  that  reaching  an\r\n\r\nagreement  with  Malaysia on the package of issues  would  be\r\n\r\nmutually  beneficial to both countries.  We are committed  to\r\n\r\nforging  a  long-term  relationship with  Malaysia  based  on\r\n\r\nmutual  respect  and sovereign equality to realise  the  full\r\n\r\npotential  in  our bilateral relationship.   While  I  cannot\r\n\r\npredict the outcome of the negotiations, which I believe will\r\n\r\nbegin soon, let me state that Singapore will continue to take\r\n\r\na  constructive approach with the aim of finding a  `win-win'\r\n\r\nsolution to these bilateral issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether it is possible for him to disclose some\r\n\r\nmain  details  of  the  contents of  the  counter-offer  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and  also whether it is possible for  us  to  know\r\n\r\nabout  Singapore's position, because I think  the  public  is\r\n\r\ninterested  in this matter.  And if it is not possible,  then\r\n\r\nat  least he could let us know what kind of tack we intend to\r\n\r\ntake   with   regard  to  Malaysia's  request.

We have heard the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime Minister speak in this Chamber of the position we  will\r\n\r\ntake   on  water,  so  that  we  will  increasingly  distance\r\n\r\nourselves  away  from  dependence  on  water  and   rely   on\r\n\r\nalternative  sources.   The  issue  now  is  not   on   broad\r\n\r\nprinciples any more.  Both sides have to get down to details.\r\n\r\nAnd  on  water, for example, we have to get down on  details,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  amount, the quantum, the mix between  raw  and\r\n\r\ntreated  water, and on pricing.  But these will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nsorted out together with a host of other issues when we first\r\n\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> May I ask the Minister,\r\n\r\nwith  this wavering of decisions by the Malaysian side,  will\r\n\r\nthis  be the last time that these changes will stop?

As Foreign Minister, I do not have\r\n\r\nthe details of this, but if he were to file a Question or use\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity during the Committee of Supply to direct his\r\n\r\nrequest  to  the  appropriate Minister,  which  will  be  the\r\n\r\nMinister for the Environment, I am sure he will get a  fuller\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I want to ask about water as\r\n\r\nwell,  but in a different context.  Since the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas mentioned that Singapore intends to be self-sufficient in\r\n\r\nwater, especially with NEWater and other water supplies, how\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndid  the Malaysians react so far in their communication  with\r\n\r\nus, ie, whether they have a particular response?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is in the same line of questioning.\r\n\r\nThe  Malaysians  had  mentioned  the  disagreement  over  our\r\n\r\nreclamation of the shores between Singapore and Malaysia.  We\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  want  to  wait for  a  third  party  official\r\n\r\ncommunication  from  Malaysia.   So,  has  there   been   any\r\n\r\ncommunication from the Malaysians on this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Leong Horn Kee asked two questions.\r\n\r\nThe  first part of his question was: what was the Malaysians'\r\n\r\nresponse  to  what we have said about developing  alternative\r\n\r\nsources?   There  has not been any official response  because\r\n\r\nthis  was a statement made by the Prime Minister.  But  I  am\r\n\r\nsure the Member as well as other Members would have noted  in\r\n\r\nthe  media, some of their leaders have made statements to the\r\n\r\neffect that this is up to Singapore.  But there has not  been\r\n\r\nany  official  response.  Whether we will  take  this  up  in\r\n\r\ndetail  during  the  first round of  discussions  is  another\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reclamation is not an issue as part of the package. But\r\n\r\nsince  the  Member has raised the question,  let  me  recall,\r\n\r\nfirst, what we have said in this Chamber - that Malaysia  had\r\n\r\npreviously sent us two notes.  And these notes were  on  28th\r\n\r\nJanuary  and  2nd  April.  But those  first  two  Notes  were\r\n\r\nconfined  solely to their claim that our reclamation  in  the\r\n\r\nTuas  area  had  encroached on their territorial  waters  and\r\n\r\njurisdiction,  which  is not true and we  have  categorically\r\n\r\nrefuted those claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Malaysians have sent us a note on 30th\r\n\r\nApril protesting our reclamation works around Tekong and Ubin\r\n\r\non broad grounds of trans-boundary environmental impact.  But\r\n\r\nI  should  say  that  neither the latest  Note  nor  the  two\r\n\r\nprevious  Notes in any way contain the detailed  facts  about\r\n\r\ntheir concerns of how the reclamation has affected them.  You\r\n\r\nwill recall that Singapore has consistently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the Malaysians ought to send us a note  itemising\r\n\r\ntheir  concerns.   And  this was requested  by  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  when he visited Malaysia in March.  The  Malaysians\r\n\r\nhave  said that they will send us such a note.  What we  need\r\n\r\nreally  is  not itemisation of general allegations  or  broad\r\n\r\ncomplaints.   What we need are details of how our reclamation\r\n\r\nhas adversely affected them, then only we can reply.  We have\r\n\r\nto-date  not  received such a note itemising and setting  out\r\n\r\nthe details of their concerns.  They have said that they will\r\n\r\nsend  us  that  note.  Members would have read in  the  media\r\n\r\ncomments by their leaders that they are preparing such a note\r\n\r\nand  it may take a few months.  We await that note.  When  we\r\n\r\nreceive  that  note and we have the details of their  claims,\r\n\r\nnot broad allegations, we will study them and give a reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>GENERAL ELECTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister whether\r\n\r\nfor  the  next General Election he is willing to (i)  release\r\n\r\nthe  report of the Boundaries Review Committee at  least  six\r\n\r\nmonths  before the dissolution of Parliament; (ii) limit  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  candidates in a Group Representation Constituency\r\n\r\nto  three or, in any case, to not more than six; (iii) reduce\r\n\r\nthe   election  deposit  from  $13,000  to  $3,000  for  each\r\n\r\ncandidate; (iv) have more than one designated rally site in a\r\n\r\nsingle-member  constituency; and (v) increase the  number  of\r\n\r\ndays for campaigning from eight to fourteen days.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, electoral boundaries\r\n\r\nare  reviewed from time to time, following population  shifts\r\n\r\narising  from  housing developments.  It is the  practice  of\r\n\r\nevery  Electoral Boundaries Review Committee to  release  its\r\n\r\nreport  in the form of a White Paper, as soon as it is  ready\r\n\r\nand  without  undue  delay.   The  date  of  dissolution   of\r\n\r\nParliament is not decided by the Electoral Boundaries  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Parliament is dissolved by the President  on  the\r\n\r\nadvice  of  the  Prime Minister.  In any  case,  if  the  new\r\n\r\nboundaries were to be used, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElectoral  Boundaries Review Committee's  Report  has  to  be\r\n\r\nreleased before the dissolution of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of number of GRC candidates, the law\r\n\r\nalready   limits  the  number  of  candidates  in   a   Group\r\n\r\nRepresentation Constituency to between three and six.   There\r\n\r\nis no intention to change this now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of electoral deposit, the law\r\n\r\nspecifies  that  the  deposit is 8% of the  total  allowances\r\n\r\npayable  to an elected Member of Parliament in the  preceding\r\n\r\nyear.   This  is necessary, to confine elections  to  serious\r\n\r\ncandidates.   Reducing the deposit way below an MP's  monthly\r\n\r\nallowance would attract frivolous candidates who would  stand\r\n\r\nfor  election with no serious hope of getting elected.   They\r\n\r\nwould  try  their  luck as there is less  to  lose,  and  our\r\n\r\nelection would end up like a lottery and be demeaned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 8% figure is not something that we conjured out\r\n\r\nof  thin  air.  There is a basis for this: it is roughly  the\r\n\r\nequivalent  of an MP's monthly allowance.  Historically,  our\r\n\r\nelection  deposit  has  always been  pegged  to  the  monthly\r\n\r\nallowance  of an MP.  When the deposit was fixed at  $500  in\r\n\r\n1954, the monthly allowance of a Legislative Assemblyman  was\r\n\r\n$500.  The deposit was raised to $1,200 in 1973 and $1,500 in\r\n\r\n1978 when the monthly allowance of an MP in 1973 and 1978 was\r\n\r\n$1,136 and $1,483, respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Elections Act was then amended in\r\n\r\n1988  to provide a formula to automatically change the amount\r\n\r\nof  election deposit whenever the MP's allowance  is  varied,\r\n\r\nwithout  any  need  for periodic reviews.  Nevertheless,  the\r\n\r\nprinciple has remained the same, which is that the deposit is\r\n\r\npegged at an MP's monthly allowance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any serious candidate should be able to raise this\r\n\r\namount.   In  the recent general election, 35 (including  the\r\n\r\nfive  disqualified  for documentary defects)  opposition  and\r\n\r\nindependent  candidates presented themselves for  nomination.\r\n\r\nThis shows that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nraising  money  for the deposit was no deterrent  to  serious\r\n\r\ncandidates.   In  any  case, practically all  candidates  can\r\n\r\nreclaim their election deposit.   What they have to do is  to\r\n\r\npoll  at least one-eighth of the electoral votes.   It should\r\n\r\nnot be difficult for any candidate with a serious platform to\r\n\r\nsecure this minimum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of rally sites, election rally\r\n\r\nsites  are  selected by the police, based on  law  and  order\r\n\r\nconsiderations  as  well  as the  need  to  avoid  causing  a\r\n\r\nnuisance  to  the  residents.  As Singapore has  become  more\r\n\r\nbuilt-up, it is getting more and more difficult to find  many\r\n\r\nsites  suitable  to hold election rallies, especially  fields\r\n\r\nand  other open areas.  We may have no choice but to  confine\r\n\r\nrallies  to be held in enclosed areas like sports  stadia  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also especially difficult to find suitable\r\n\r\nmultiple sites within a single-member constituency because of\r\n\r\nits  smaller geographical size.  In time to come, the  police\r\n\r\nmay  conceivably  not  be able to find even  one  rally  site\r\n\r\nwithin some constituencies.  It may then be necessary to zone\r\n\r\nelectoral  constituencies and have some  of  them  share  the\r\n\r\nrally sites in the area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the question of number of days for campaigning,\r\n\r\nSir, in 1960, the minimum period of election campaign was set\r\n\r\nat eight days to bring our legislation more in line with what\r\n\r\nwas current in other parts of the British Commonwealth and in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom.   It  was also  because  the  Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment  had  by  then  gained sufficient  experience  and\r\n\r\nmachinery to conduct an election more expeditiously.  We have\r\n\r\nnot varied much from this minimum period for the past general\r\n\r\nelections.  Between elections, political parties are free  to\r\n\r\ncommunicate to the population their political agenda and  air\r\n\r\ntheir  views  on  national policies.  Unlike  a  large  rural\r\n\r\ncountry,  in a small but highly urbanised country like  ours,\r\n\r\nfully  served  by  roads and public transport,  coupled  with\r\n\r\nuniversal access to all manner of communications media, there\r\n\r\nis really no need for a more prolonged campaigning period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nsays  that  the  report  of the Electoral  Boundaries  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee shall be published as soon as it is ready.  Between\r\n\r\nelections,  there is a period of about three,  four  or  five\r\n\r\nyears.   Why is it that at the last election, the report  was\r\n\r\nonly ready one day before Parliament was dissolved?  They had\r\n\r\nplenty of time.  Why should they choose to release it one day\r\n\r\nbefore  the dissolution of Parliament?  Perhaps, the Minister\r\n\r\ncould explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of members in a GRC, the purpose\r\n\r\nof  a  GRC  of  course  is to ensure  that  there  is  ethnic\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in Singapore.  But I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether or not ethnic PAP candidates are  confident\r\n\r\nif  they  have  only one non-ethnic candidate to  hold  their\r\n\r\nhands  to  get into Parliament.  Or do they need two,  three,\r\n\r\nfour  or  five  candidates to get them into Parliament.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  six  is more for PAP electoral purposes  than  to\r\n\r\nensure  ethnic  representation in  Singapore.   Perhaps,  the\r\n\r\nMinister would like to comment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I agree that the timing of the\r\n\r\npublication  of  the  Electoral Boundaries  Review  Committee\r\n\r\nReport  was rather short.  It was an unusual occasion because\r\n\r\nit  was  just  after  September 11 and with  the  economy  in\r\n\r\nrecession,  the  Government has to deal  with  urgent  issues\r\n\r\nfacing  us.   The Electoral Boundaries Review Committee  took\r\n\r\nquite a short time - I would say about three or four weeks  - to complete its report, although the officers might have done\r\n\r\nsome  work  resulting from the changes in the  population  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  shift  in the voters.  Immediately  after  the\r\n\r\nreport was ready, it was published.  The Prime Minister  then\r\n\r\ndecided that it was necessary to go to the people to  have  a\r\n\r\nmandate  to  deal  with very urgent problems confronting  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  we found out that, indeed, the decision  was  a\r\n\r\ncorrect one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked why do we need three, four or five non-minority candidates to be in the GRC. Is that the question?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> To bring them into Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The purpose of the GRC is to ensure\r\n\r\nthat   Parliament   has  the  representation   of   all   our\r\n\r\ncommunities, including the Malays, Indians and other minority\r\n\r\ncommunities.   So  we have in the provision  of  the  law,  a\r\n\r\nminimum  of three candidates in a GRC, but no more than  six.\r\n\r\nThat has been the practice all along.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> That is the purpose behind the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> That is right. So we have that, and\r\n\r\nwe  have  achieved  the  purpose.  I do  not  understand  the\r\n\r\npurpose of his question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, if I understand the Minister\r\n\r\ncorrectly, the delay of the publication of the report of  the\r\n\r\nElectoral  Boundaries Review Committee was due  to  September\r\n\r\n11.   Can he explain what has September 11 got to do with the\r\n\r\npreparation of the report of the Electoral Boundaries  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point about the GRC is that you want to ensure\r\n\r\nminority candidates.  The rationale behind it is that if  you\r\n\r\nhave  a  Chinese candidate and a non-Chinese candidate  in  a\r\n\r\nsingle-seat  constituency, the PAP thinks  that  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncandidate  will win against a non-Chinese candidate.   So  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the PAP ethnic candidate gets into  Parliament,\r\n\r\nthey  must have some non-ethnic candidates to come along with\r\n\r\nthem, to bring them into Parliament.  My point is: why do you\r\n\r\nneed  five  other  non-ethnic candidates to  get  the  ethnic\r\n\r\ncandidates into Parliament?  I think one is enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> That is where I am confused by Mr\r\n\r\nChiam's question.  Firstly, he did not hear me correctly.   I\r\n\r\ndid not say that the publication was due to the September  11\r\n\r\nincident.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> You mentioned it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Please check the record. I will\r\n\r\nrepeat  it here again for his benefit.  What I have said  was\r\n\r\nthat the Committee was already doing its work and when it had\r\n\r\nfinished, the report was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublished.  Because of the September 11 incident as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  urgency  to  deal  with the economic  problems  we  were\r\n\r\nfacing, the Prime Minister decided on a quick election.  That\r\n\r\nis  what  I said.  The results bore themselves out  that  the\r\n\r\ndecision  was  correct and the people gave  the  PAP  a  very\r\n\r\nstrong mandate to ensure that we would deal with the problems\r\n\r\nwe are facing now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of minority candidates, we all know that\r\n\r\nin  all our constituencies, the racial distribution is  quite\r\n\r\neven.   We have explained before that the purpose of the  GRC\r\n\r\nis   to  ensure  that  we  have  minority  representation  in\r\n\r\nParliament and that is why we decided to have GRCs.   It  has\r\n\r\nserved  our  purpose that we now have minority candidates  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  Whether we need three, four or five  others,  it\r\n\r\ndepends  on the configuration of the constituency.   In  some\r\n\r\nareas, it may be more convenient to group them in three, some\r\n\r\nmaybe  four,  some  maybe five, and  some  maybe  six.   From\r\n\r\nexperience, this has borne out to be correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, as regards the election\r\n\r\ndeposits, the rationale is that the Government wants to  keep\r\n\r\nout   frivolous   candidates.   The   average   thinking   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans is that $13,000 is definitely too high a figure.\r\n\r\nThe  non-PAP candidates, most of them, are not well off.   In\r\n\r\nfact, personally, I know that many serious candidates who are\r\n\r\nin the opposition would have stood for the elections, but for\r\n\r\nthis  $13,000.  It is not only the candidate himself who  has\r\n\r\nto worry about the $13,000 ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, could you ask your supplementary\r\n\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am coming to it. The candidate\r\n\r\nwill  also  have  to discuss, being Asians, with  members  of\r\n\r\ntheir family, their wives, and most of them feel that $13,000\r\n\r\nis  too  much,  and they do not allow the serious  opposition\r\n\r\ncandidate  to  take part.  The other rationale  is  that  the\r\n\r\ndeposit is pegged to the MP's allowance.  Why do we not  have\r\n\r\ntwo categories then?  For incumbent Members who want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  stand  again, they can take this standard of one  month's\r\n\r\nallowance.   But those who are coming in for the  first  time\r\n\r\nand  who  are not MPs, we can reduce it to $3,000.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether the Minister will allow two categories of deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I do not know about the average\r\n\r\nthinking of Singaporeans.  That is what Mr Chiam said.  I  am\r\n\r\njust  quoting  him.   I  know  of  the  thinking  of  average\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the candidates think that $13,000 is too much and\r\n\r\nfear  losing their deposit, then they really do not have  the\r\n\r\nconfidence that they can even get the support of 1/8  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters  and  they should seriously think again  whether  they\r\n\r\nshould  contest.  There are examples of this.  Dr  Tan  Cheng\r\n\r\nBock  will probably know.  The voters there hardly  saw  that\r\n\r\nopposition candidate who lost his deposit.  Mr Tan Kim Chuang\r\n\r\nprobably  did  not appeal to the voters in Bukit  Timah  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, also lost his deposit.  But any serious candidate,\r\n\r\nanyone   with  a  good  platform,  should  have  no   problem\r\n\r\nconvincing 1/8 of the electorate to vote for him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of two categories of candidates is, I think, a\r\n\r\nvery  amazing  one.   I  cannot see  the  logic  behind  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion:  that  new  candidates  pay  less  and  incumbent\r\n\r\ncandidates or MPs who have retired and want to contest  again\r\n\r\npay more.  Why do we discriminate between different types  of\r\n\r\ncandidates?  They are all candidates.  After all, if he is an\r\n\r\nelected  MP, he is an elected MP.  There are no differentials\r\n\r\nin  rights for the MPs if they are elected.  So why does  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  want  to  have different  classes  of  MPs  and\r\n\r\ndifferent classes of candidates?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, the Minister, in his\r\n\r\nmain answer on the question of rally sites, says that law and\r\n\r\norder is the main consideration as to why the number of rally\r\n\r\nsites is reduced and why some rally sites are not even within\r\n\r\nthe  constituencies themselves.  Does the Minister agree that\r\n\r\npublic  rallies during elections are probably the only  links\r\n\r\nthat the Opposition could reach out to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvoters  effectively?  Thus, by reducing the number  of  rally\r\n\r\nsites or moving the rally site far away from the constituency\r\n\r\nitself  will  reduce the influence that the Opposition  could\r\n\r\nhave  to persuade the voters to vote for them.  Does he  also\r\n\r\nagree  that  the same argument of law and order applies,  ie,\r\n\r\nwould  there  be  a day when we have elections  but  have  no\r\n\r\npublic  rallies,  because law and order is  a  concern?   And\r\n\r\nwould there then be that, somehow, elections will cause  some\r\n\r\nproblem  of  law and order and, thereby, there  shall  be  no\r\n\r\nelections because of law and order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think Mr Low is trying to string A\r\n\r\n+  B  =  C,  which  need not necessarily be so  in  his  last\r\n\r\nquestion,  ie,  that  because we could  have  law  and  order\r\n\r\nproblems,  and  therefore better not have rallies.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat is a stretch of the imagination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rallies are not the only ways that candidates reach out\r\n\r\nto  their voters.  On that I disagree with him.  Rallies  are\r\n\r\njust  one  of  the ways for candidates to reach  out  to  the\r\n\r\nvoters.  In fact, if he says that because the rally sites are\r\n\r\nfar  away from residents and therefore may affect the voters'\r\n\r\ndecision to vote for a particular candidate, the results will\r\n\r\nbear  themselves out.  One would find it quite  strange  that\r\n\r\nvery few people attended the PAP rallies and yet thousands of\r\n\r\nthem  turned  up at the Opposition rallies.  Those  who  have\r\n\r\nattended rallies would know that.  So I would say that as far\r\n\r\nas  rally  sites are concerned, it is no deterrent to  people\r\n\r\nwho  want  to attend a rally.  In the case of Mr  Chiam,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  on  his last evening at the Lavender  Street  rally\r\n\r\nsite,  he  had  13,000 people turning up, with  quite  a  few\r\n\r\nhundred of them spilling onto the streets.  So I do not quite\r\n\r\nagree  with  this argument that because rally sites  are  far\r\n\r\naway  and therefore voters would not turn up.  In fact,  they\r\n\r\nwill  turn  up  if  they think that there is  a  show.   Some\r\n\r\nconsider  this  to  be  a  show  because  they  like  to   be\r\n\r\nentertained, and we are not good entertainers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The Minister has agreed that\r\n\r\nthe short period given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the last election is unusual.  Can the Minister give  the\r\n\r\nassurance that this kind of short one-day notice between  the\r\n\r\nElectoral   Boundaries  Review  Committee  Report   and   the\r\n\r\ndissolution of Parliament would not happen in future?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I cannot guarantee that it would\r\n\r\nnot happen but I would say that we will try not to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Why not the Government call the\r\n\r\nElectoral   Boundaries  Review  Committee   to   review   the\r\n\r\nboundaries  much earlier, way before an election?

In fact, many thousands of people  do\r\n\r\nchange  addresses  every month and if we  have  an  electoral\r\n\r\nboundary  fixed on a particular day and yet the  election  is\r\n\r\nheld,  say,  two  years or a year, or even six  months  after\r\n\r\nthat, many voters would be inconvenienced to have to go  back\r\n\r\nto the place where they stayed to vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned Mr Tan\r\n\r\nKim  Chuang.

I said the opposition candidate in  Ayer\r\n\r\nRajah  did  not seem quite serious because he  did  not  even\r\n\r\nbother to turn up and, in the case of Bukit Timah, the voters\r\n\r\ndid not find Mr Tan Kim Chuang's platform appealing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, as regards the report of the\r\n\r\nElectoral Boundaries Review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee, I think releasing its report six months earlier is\r\n\r\ndefinitely not too early.  Even assuming there are changes of\r\n\r\naddresses within the six months, and normally there are,  and\r\n\r\neven  if you look at the Electoral Register, there is  always\r\n\r\nthat  yellow section where you will find all the persons  who\r\n\r\nhave  moved within the last three, four, five or six  months.\r\n\r\nSo this can be done.  I cannot understand why the Minister is\r\n\r\nmentioning  that  six months is too long.   I  just  want  to\r\n\r\nremind the Minister that I am not asking for two years or one\r\n\r\nyear.  I am only asking for six months for the results of the\r\n\r\nElectoral Boundaries Review Committee to be announced  before\r\n\r\nthe  dissolution of Parliament.  In case he has forgotten  my\r\n\r\nrequest, it is six months, not two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the deposit, I do not see any discrimination\r\n\r\nif  there  is  a  two-tier deposit.   I  wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister is willing to rethink and give us an answer  or,  at\r\n\r\nleast, say that he will consider and not brush it off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in the number of days for\r\n\r\ncampaigning,  increasing it from eight to  14  days  is  very\r\n\r\nreasonable, and I hope the Minister will at least say he will\r\n\r\nconsider,  because  this  is  definitely  in  line  with  the\r\n\r\nremaking of Singapore.  If we want to have more vibrancy  and\r\n\r\nideas, the longer the election period, the more ideas will be\r\n\r\nthrown up.  It is not a show.

That decision  has\r\n\r\nto be taken later by the Prime Minister, and I would not want\r\n\r\nto  encumber  him by telling Members that that would  be  the\r\n\r\ncase.  But I am sure the Prime Minister will take all factors\r\n\r\ninto consideration when deciding on the date of the election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot find any logic to the argument to provide for a\r\n\r\ntwo-tier deposit for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent types of candidates.

Ideas should always be thrown  up\r\n\r\nif  they  are good ideas, and they should be communicated  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  and, at least, they should try to  convince  the\r\n\r\npeople that these are good ideas for acceptance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should let the House know too, Sir, that in\r\n\r\nthe  UK,  for example, they used to have a time of not  later\r\n\r\nthan nine days between Nomination Day and Polling Day.  Then,\r\n\r\nin  1981, they amended it to no later than 10 days, in  other\r\n\r\nwords, between Nomination Day and Polling Day, it must be  no\r\n\r\nlater than 10 days, and the reason then was that Saturday was\r\n\r\nno longer a working day for election officials and the period\r\n\r\nwas  extended by a day.  And in 1985 they changed  it  to  11\r\n\r\ndays  because  they wanted to give more time for  the  postal\r\n\r\nballots  to  come  in.  So even in a large country  like  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, the campaigning period after Nomination  Day\r\n\r\nis only no more than 11 days.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister has cited the UK\r\n\r\nexample.

So  there is a preparation period.  At least  people\r\n\r\ncan  go around and do their campaigning one month before  the\r\n\r\nelection  is held.

These  include opposition  to  the  use  of  force\r\n\r\nagainst the territorial integrity or political sovereignty of\r\n\r\nany state, and respect for the principles of equal rights and\r\n\r\nself-determination of peoples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have good relations with Israel as well as with\r\n\r\nthe  Palestinian  Authority.   Singapore  has  supported  the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the Palestinian people,  and  has  voted  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  all United Nations General Assembly  resolutions\r\n\r\npertinent to the Palestinian question.  At the same time,  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  the  right of Israel to exist  as  an  independent\r\n\r\nstate  within secure and recognised borders, but  Israel,  in\r\n\r\nturn, must recognise the inalienable right of the Palestinian\r\n\r\npeople to a homeland of their own and must comply with United\r\n\r\nNations  Security Council resolutions on withdrawal from  the\r\n\r\noccupied territories.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of a region where two states, Israel and\r\n\r\nPalestine,  live side by side, within secure  and  recognised\r\n\r\nborders,  has  been  enshrined in  the  UN  Security  Council\r\n\r\nResolution 1397 of 12th March 2002, for which Singapore voted\r\n\r\nin favour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent deteriorating crisis in the Middle East is a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  grave concern.  This escalation of  violence  has\r\n\r\ncontinued\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunabated for far too long, resulting in a senseless  loss  of\r\n\r\nlives  of  so  many innocent people.  In the  United  Nations\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council, we have joined other members in expressing\r\n\r\noutrage that innocent civilians have been targeted and killed\r\n\r\nfor  military and political reasons.  In particular, we  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  our  concerns over alarming  reports  of  what  UN\r\n\r\nofficials have described as a horrific devastation and a dire\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  situation in the Palestinian cities.   We  have\r\n\r\ndeplored in the strongest terms all acts of terror, and  have\r\n\r\ncalled for an end to the extreme acts by both sides.   As  an\r\n\r\nelected  member of the Security Council, we have worked  with\r\n\r\nthe 14 other members and voted in support of four resolutions\r\n\r\nin  the  recent two months to demand an immediate end to  the\r\n\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we believe that there must be a withdrawal of\r\n\r\nIsraeli  forces from the Palestinian cities, accompanied,  at\r\n\r\nthe   same  time,  by  genuine  efforts  of  the  Palestinian\r\n\r\nAuthority  to  take action against acts of terror.   In  this\r\n\r\nregard, Sir, the UN Security Council has supported the  joint\r\n\r\nstatement  of  10  April 2002 of the  quartet,  ie,  the  US,\r\n\r\nRussia,  EU  and  the UN Secretary-General, which  called  on\r\n\r\nChairman  Arafat  to  use the full weight  of  his  political\r\n\r\nauthority to persuade the Palestinian people that any or  all\r\n\r\nterrorist  attacks against Israelis should  end  immediately.\r\n\r\nThis  is  in the interests of the Palestinians, for,  as  the\r\n\r\njoint  statement  also  said, \"Terrorism,  including  suicide\r\n\r\nbombs,  is illegal and immoral, and has inflicted grave  harm\r\n\r\nto  the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and\r\n\r\nmust be condemned, as called for in Resolution 1373.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been claims and counter claims as to the\r\n\r\nnature  and  extent of the humanitarian situation, especially\r\n\r\nin  the refugee camp in Jinin.  At the UN, we have said  that\r\n\r\nthe  only way to objectively assess the situation is  for  an\r\n\r\nindependent  and  impartial  body  to  establish  the  facts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we and other Council Members voted unanimously  on\r\n\r\n19th   April   to  support  Secretary-General  Kofi   Annan's\r\n\r\ninitiative to despatch a fact finding team to Jinin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that it was in Israel's interest to have a\r\n\r\nfull and public clarification of the situation in Jinin.   It\r\n\r\nis  therefore unfortunate that the Secretary-General has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  forced  by Israel's continued rejection  of  the  fact-finding   team   to  disband  the  team.   In  the   informal\r\n\r\nconsultation  at the Security Council, we have joined  others\r\n\r\nin expressing deep regret at Israel's rebuff of the Secretary-General's  efforts.  We hope that the Secretary-General  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to collate all available information on  Jinin  and\r\n\r\nkeep  the  Council  informed as accurate information  becomes\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore supports the immediate relief efforts to\r\n\r\naddress the humanitarian crisis.  Israel's obligation and the\r\n\r\ninternational  laws are clear.  It must allow and  facilitate\r\n\r\nimmediate  access by humanitarian agencies to mount emergency\r\n\r\nrescue operations in the affected areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, decades of tragic violence have clearly\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  that there can be no military solution  to  the\r\n\r\nconflict.   We support all efforts to bring about an  end  to\r\n\r\nthe  violence and the resumption of the peace process.  These\r\n\r\ninclude  Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah's Arab peace initiative,\r\n\r\nthe  efforts of the quartet involving the US, EU, Russia  and\r\n\r\nthe  UN  Secretary-General, and all these efforts  have  been\r\n\r\nsupported by the UN Security Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also welcome the latest news that the siege on\r\n\r\nChairman  Arafat  has been lifted as a result  of  diplomatic\r\n\r\nefforts  undertaken by the US and UK.  Sir, we  believe  also\r\n\r\nthat  the UN Secretary-General has a vital role to play.   We\r\n\r\nhave  responded  positively  to his  proposal  to  deploy  an\r\n\r\nimpartial and robust multi-national force to the region,  and\r\n\r\nwe   have   urged  the  Council  to  consider  the  situation\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me say that the immediate priority now\r\n\r\nis  to  break the cycle of violence.  What is urgently needed\r\n\r\nis  a  political will to end the violence and  implement  the\r\n\r\nceasefire which would pave the way to the resumption of peace\r\n\r\ntalks.  But the primary responsibility, Sir, clearly falls on\r\n\r\nthe parties themselves.  Nonetheless, Singapore will continue\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork with other members of the Security Council to adopt  the\r\n\r\nconstructive approach to assist the parties to reach a  just,\r\n\r\nlasting and comprehensive peace.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, I would like to say\r\n\r\nthat I am personally satisfied that we, Singapore, are equal,\r\n\r\nfair  and  impartial.  But I would like to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether he cares to elaborate that in our position in the  UN\r\n\r\nSecurity Council, of which we are a member, whether we  could\r\n\r\ndraw  any lessons from this very difficult situation and very\r\n\r\ndifficult time, because we are a very small nation.   And  if\r\n\r\nthe  impasse  continues in the Middle East, could  we,  as  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country, together with other nations, take any further\r\n\r\nsteps to improve the situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, to deal with the second part of\r\n\r\nhis  question  first,  yes, we are in the  Security  Council.\r\n\r\nAnd  for this month, in May, we have the Presidency   of  the\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council.  We will do our part as a  member  of  the\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council and, for this month, as President,  working\r\n\r\nclosely  with the other members of the Security  Council  and\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary-General,  to facilitate  the  discussions,  to\r\n\r\nreach  whatever constructive solutions that can  be  had  for\r\n\r\nthis  very difficult problem.  It is a problem that has  been\r\n\r\nin  the  world  and the region for decades.  Many  a  leading\r\n\r\nstatesman has been involved in offering good offices.   There\r\n\r\nhave been many accords and peace plans; the Mitchel Plan, the\r\n\r\nTenet  Plan,  Oslo Accord, Madrid Accord and so on,  but  the\r\n\r\ncrisis  has not eased up.  We have a sense of realism  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat  Singapore can do because, as I said in my main  answer,\r\n\r\nreally  it  calls  for political will and a  resolve  of  the\r\n\r\nparties  themselves.   Clearly also  that  there  can  be  no\r\n\r\nmilitary solution to the conflict.  But to the extent that we\r\n\r\ncan,  we  will  play  our part as a member  of  the  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil,  but  I would not want to overstate  it  because  it\r\n\r\nessentially falls on the parties themselves and the permanent\r\n\r\nmembers   of   the  Security  Council;  the   United   States\r\n\r\nparticularly plays a very important role in this process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What lessons can we draw?

One\r\n\r\nwhere  contract  workers are supplied  to  a  company  by  an\r\n\r\nemployment  agency  or  manpower  supplier.   Such   contract\r\n\r\nworkers,  including  part-timers,  temporary  staff  have  an\r\n\r\nemployee-employer  relationship with the agency  or  manpower\r\n\r\nsupplier.   They are covered by the Employment Act and  other\r\n\r\nlegislation  such  as the CPF Act and Workmen's  Compensation\r\n\r\nAct.    Hence,  their  employment  terms  and  benefits   are\r\n\r\nprotected  by  these  laws.   The second  group  of  contract\r\n\r\nworkers are those engaged on contract for service such  as  a\r\n\r\nplumber,  painter or private tutor to do a specific task  for\r\n\r\nan  agreed  fee.   Persons under a contract for  service  are\r\n\r\nindependent    contractors    with    no    employer-employee\r\n\r\nrelationship  with  the service user.  Hence,  they  are  not\r\n\r\ncovered by labour laws as the end users of the services  have\r\n\r\nno obligation to provide welfare and benefits to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person is indeed engaged as an employee and is not\r\n\r\ngiven  the benefits as stipulated in the labour laws such  as\r\n\r\nCPF contribution or statutory benefits in the Employment Act,\r\n\r\nthe  person  should  approach the Ministry  of  Manpower  for\r\n\r\nadvice and assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry recently conducted a study on more than\r\n\r\n2,000  contract  workers employed by 14 labour  suppliers  or\r\n\r\nagencies  and  deployed  to work at clients'  premises.   The\r\n\r\nstudy revealed that the majority of the labour suppliers  and\r\n\r\nagencies  do  provide benefits under the Employment  Act  for\r\n\r\ntheir  contract workers. Only a very small number  of  labour\r\n\r\nsuppliers  failed to provide the statutory benefits  such  as\r\n\r\nsick leave and hospitalisation leave. The study also revealed\r\n\r\nthat  the  labour suppliers and employment agencies had  paid\r\n\r\nCPF  contributions for their contract employees.  My Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  conduct checks on  companies  and  labour\r\n\r\nsuppliers to ensure that contract employees are provided with\r\n\r\nthe   benefits  under  the  Employment  Act  and  their   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions are duly paid.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  what  is the assessment  of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower  as to the extent of the problem.  I think the  real\r\n\r\nissue  here  is that people are being employed on a  contract\r\n\r\nfor  service when actually they are employees.

The employers are also\r\n\r\nrequired  to settle all outstanding wages due to the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.

In  1997,  the   Asian\r\n\r\nFinancial  Crisis  overwhelmed our  region,  abruptly  ending\r\n\r\nthree decades of peace, stability and economic development in\r\n\r\nSoutheast   Asia.  The  economic,  political   and   security\r\n\r\nconsequences  of the crisis have yet to work themselves  out.\r\n\r\nIn  2001,  economic  conditions  world-wide  grew  even  more\r\n\r\ndifficult as the world's three largest economies - the United\r\n\r\nStates (US), Japan and Germany - experienced sharp,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsynchronised  downturns. Singapore was  directly  exposed  to\r\n\r\nthese external shocks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the September 11 terrorist attacks on the US.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the initial fears of major economic  dislocation\r\n\r\nand loss of confidence have not materialised. However, we  in\r\n\r\nSinga-pore  have  learnt  how real  and  close  to  home  the\r\n\r\nterrorist danger is, rooted in the region and threatening our\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, our GDP shrank by 2%, the worst decline since\r\n\r\nindependence. Many Singaporeans lost their jobs. Fortunately,\r\n\r\nour strong social cohesion helped us to weather the storm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are entering a very different world. Conditions are\r\n\r\nuncertain  and  volatile, competition is intense,  change  is\r\n\r\nfaster  than  ever. Our ability to adapt nimbly  and  quickly\r\n\r\nwill  give us a valuable edge. In our personal lives too,  we\r\n\r\nmust  expect  change  and disruption. Lifetime  learning  and\r\n\r\ntraining  will be the norm, while a life-long career  in  one\r\n\r\njob will become less and less common.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot prevent the changes from happening. Instead,\r\n\r\nwe  must  act  decisively  to restructure  our  economy,  and\r\n\r\nprepare for the challenges ahead. We have the resources to do\r\n\r\nthis,  but  we  must start early. This is our  best  hope  of\r\n\r\nstaying  ahead in the race, and creating jobs for our people.\r\n\r\nThis Budget is constructed with these objectives in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>A Different World</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent performance of the global economy and our\r\n\r\neconomy  reflects increased uncertainty and  volatility.  The\r\n\r\nbusiness  cycle  has shortened and swings  have  become  more\r\n\r\nextreme.  For example, global chip sales enjoyed a boom  year\r\n\r\nwith  37%  growth in 2000, but crashed in 2001, shrinking  by\r\n\r\n32%.  Before 1997, Singapore enjoyed a decade-long boom  with\r\n\r\nannual growth averaging 9.2%. Since then, our economic growth\r\n\r\nhas  averaged  a very respectable 4.7%, but  it  has  been  a\r\n\r\nroller-coaster ride*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*Singapore's economic growth (1997-2001): 1997 (8.5%); 1998 (-0.1%); 1999 (6.9%); 2000 (10.3%); 2001 (-2.0%).\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recession last year, all the external engines of\r\n\r\nour  economy sputtered. The fall-off in global demand quickly\r\n\r\nfiltered   through  to  all  sectors  of  our  economy.   The\r\n\r\nelectronics  industry  was  the  worst  hit.  Export-oriented\r\n\r\nactivities,  such  as  the entrepot trade  and  trade-related\r\n\r\nservices were also badly affected. As a result, nearly 26,000\r\n\r\nworkers  were  laid  off last year, and unemployment  reached\r\n\r\n4.4%  by  the  end of 2001. 88,000 Singaporeans were  out  of\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our businesses and workers through the downturn,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  responded  promptly  with  two   off-budget\r\n\r\npackages  last  July and October, that together  amounted  to\r\n\r\n$13.5 billion. We brought forward infrastructure projects and\r\n\r\nreduced  business costs. We distributed New Singapore Shares,\r\n\r\nfocusing   on  helping  lower-income  citizens.  We  expanded\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  retrain workers and get those  who  had  lost\r\n\r\ntheir jobs back into the workforce. We drew on the savings we\r\n\r\nhad built up in good years to tackle the crisis in a way that\r\n\r\nfew other countries could.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Uncertain Outlook</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Global</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The external environment has picked up in the last few\r\n\r\nmonths.  The  US economy grew by a robust 5.8% in  the  first\r\n\r\nquarter  of this year after growing 1.7% in the last  quarter\r\n\r\nof 2001. Business confidence seems to be improving in the US,\r\n\r\nEuropean   Union  (EU)  and  Japan.  The  global  electronics\r\n\r\nindustry is also bottoming out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's economy has improved in tandem with these\r\n\r\ndevelopments.  After  three  successive  negative   quarters,\r\n\r\nquarter-on-quarter growth in the fourth quarter of  2001  was\r\n\r\nplus  5.6%.  The  initial estimate of q-on-q growth  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  quarter  of  2002 was plus 3.5%.  This  has  now  been\r\n\r\nsubstantially revised upwards to plus 7.7%. As a result,  MTI\r\n\r\nis more optimistic that the economy will grow faster for 2002\r\n\r\nas  a whole. The original projection for 2002 was between  1%\r\n\r\nand  3%  growth. This has now been revised up, to  growth  of\r\n\r\nbetween 2% and 4%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are not yet out of the woods. The strong growth\r\n\r\nof  the  US  economy  in  the first quarter  masks  signs  of\r\n\r\nweaknesses.  For example, US March orders for  durable  goods\r\n\r\nfell  0.6%  after  3  months of growth, and  profit  warnings\r\n\r\ncaused US stocks to fall despite the strong growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the global economy is vulnerable to political\r\n\r\nand  security  risks. Recovery does not just  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of US consumers, or how strongly the  US  economy\r\n\r\npicks up. The whole world is anxiously watching the ferocious\r\n\r\nwar   of   terror  and  reprisal  between  Israel   and   the\r\n\r\nPalestinians. If this escalates out of control into  a  wider\r\n\r\nMiddle East conflict, the consequences will be unpredictable.\r\n\r\nSo  too  if  the US moves against Iraq in its continuing  war\r\n\r\nagainst global terrorism. The disruption of oil supplies  and\r\n\r\nprices is only one of the possible side-effects. Already Iraq\r\n\r\nhas  stopped  its  oil production and called  on  other  Arab\r\n\r\nproducers to cut their oil production by half.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp rise in oil prices would adversely affect our\r\n\r\nmarkets  in  the  developed economies, as well  as  Singapore\r\n\r\ndirectly.  Even if oil prices do not spike, the  prospect  of\r\n\r\nwar   and  instability  will  put  off  investors  worldwide,\r\n\r\nundermine confidence, and set our economy back again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Regional</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospects for Southeast Asia are clouded. Economic\r\n\r\nconditions  in  these countries are reasonably  stable,  with\r\n\r\nsome opportunities for profitable investments. But the region\r\n\r\nhas  yet  to  regain  the full confidence  and  attention  of\r\n\r\ninvestors,  who  are concerned about political  and  security\r\n\r\nrisks.  Extremist and terrorist groups in the  region,  which\r\n\r\nare  linked to global terrorist networks, seek to destabilise\r\n\r\nregional  governments and attack Americans and  US  interests\r\n\r\neverywhere.  This  will further erode confidence  and  hamper\r\n\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors make Southeast Asia less attractive than\r\n\r\nNortheast Asia. China is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  biggest  and  most important new player  in  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy.  South  Korea  is  restructuring  its  economy,  and\r\n\r\nrecovering   faster  than  the  crisis-hit  Southeast   Asian\r\n\r\neconomies.   Singapore  is  still  attracting  good   quality\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  business  activities,  but  companies   are\r\n\r\nfeeling  the pull of Northeast Asia, and some are  relocating\r\n\r\ntheir  activities northwards, particularly to China and  Hong\r\n\r\nKong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This global and regional backdrop makes it more urgent\r\n\r\nfor  us to make strategic changes now. We face an uphill task\r\n\r\nto  bring  to  Singapore the economic  activities  that  will\r\n\r\nprovide  Singaporeans  with jobs. We must  also  attract  top\r\n\r\ntalent with their business ideas and activities to Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  a  world  where knowledge and skills are key  sources  of\r\n\r\nwealth, this is just as important as bringing in high  value-added  investments. Our challenge is to make  Singapore  best\r\n\r\nfor business and talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Economic Roles of Government</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br><>Macroeconomic Policies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Review Committee (ERC) is fundamentally\r\n\r\nrethinking  our  economic policies,  and  exploring  ways  to\r\n\r\npromote enterprise and growth. It is the private sector  that\r\n\r\ncreates  wealth.  Hence, our strategy must be  to  develop  a\r\n\r\nvibrant  private  sector:  entrepreneurial,  regionally   and\r\n\r\nglobally competitive, and profitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must attract more global talent, while upgrading our\r\n\r\ntertiary  education  system  and  maximising  our  own  human\r\n\r\ncapital.  We  must  develop  new  areas  of  growth  in  both\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services. Outstanding domestic  enterprises\r\n\r\nshould  be  nurtured into significant international  players.\r\n\r\nInternationally   competitive   local   companies,   led   by\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial and innovative Singaporeans, will  complement\r\n\r\nthe  multi-national corporations and make  our  economy  more\r\n\r\nresilient and dynamic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's role is to create a pro-business,\r\n\r\nstable environment in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich companies can operate efficiently. We must pursue sound\r\n\r\nmacroeconomic  policies,  including  fiscal  policy   -   the\r\n\r\ngovernment  budget; and monetary policy - the exchange  rate.\r\n\r\nThe  tax  burden must be kept as light as possible.  We  must\r\n\r\nrely  less  on direct taxes and more on indirect taxes.  This\r\n\r\nwill encourage people to strive and create wealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF savings, we need to review the balance between\r\n\r\nits different uses - healthcare, housing, and retirement.  We\r\n\r\nalso need to study the specific problems faced by older, less-educated  workers, who have difficulty finding  regular  jobs\r\n\r\nthat  pay CPF. These are complex and sensitive issues,  which\r\n\r\naffect many Singa-poreans. We will study them in detail,  and\r\n\r\nhave  not yet reached any decisions. Any changes we make will\r\n\r\nbe  done very carefully, after full consultations and without\r\n\r\ncausing  disruptions either to CPF members  or  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Government-Linked Companies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The macroeconomic functions I have just described are\r\n\r\ncommon  to  governments  in  all free  market  economies.  In\r\n\r\naddition, however, the Government in Singapore for historical\r\n\r\nreasons  also participates in business through its  interests\r\n\r\nin the Government-Linked Companies (GLCs), many of which have\r\n\r\nplayed critical roles in Singapore's economic development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs attract considerable attention, as well as a\r\n\r\nfair  share of controversy, including from MPs. One  possible\r\n\r\nreason for this is that the raison d'etre of the GLCs has not\r\n\r\nbeen  explicitly  spelt out and accepted. Minister  of  State\r\n\r\nRaymond Lim's ERC Sub-Committee on Promoting Entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nand  the  Growth  and Internationalisation of Singapore-based\r\n\r\nCompanies has been reviewing the role of the GLCs. They  have\r\n\r\ngiven  the  Government their views and ideas, which  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our philosophy is to have the GLCs operate as commercial\r\n\r\nentities. The Government does not interfere with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperations of the GLCs. The companies are supervised by their\r\n\r\nrespective boards of directors, who are accountable to  their\r\n\r\nshareholders, including the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not favour GLCs with special\r\n\r\nprivileges or hidden subsidies; nor will it burden them  with\r\n\r\nuneconomic \"national service\" responsibilities. The GLCs  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to compete on a level playing field, and frequently\r\n\r\nin a global environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As global competition heats up, the GLCs, like other\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies, will have to continually enhance  their\r\n\r\ncore  competencies. Temasek Holdings is the  holding  company\r\n\r\nthat  owns  the  Government's shares  in  most  GLCs.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore Temasek's responsibility to help the GLCs under its\r\n\r\ncharge grow into internationally competitive businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One issue of public interest is the Government's policy\r\n\r\non divesting its shares in the GLCs. Where the activities are\r\n\r\nstrategic and crucial to Singapore, such as aviation and  the\r\n\r\nelectricity  grid,  the  Government  intends  to  retain  its\r\n\r\nmajority   or   significant  stakes.  For   those   strategic\r\n\r\nactivities that are still wholly-owned, the Government  hopes\r\n\r\nto  list them in future, if it makes sense to do so in  order\r\n\r\nto help them grow and increase shareholder value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other major businesses with global or regional\r\n\r\npotential, Temasek will grow them to the benefit of Singapore\r\n\r\nover  the  long  term. If growing a GLC into a  major  player\r\n\r\nrequires the Government to dilute its stake through new share\r\n\r\nissues,  mergers or acquisitions, the Government is  prepared\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the GLCs that are no longer relevant to the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  or  Temasek's objectives, the  Government  will\r\n\r\ndivest  or dilute its shareholdings in a controlled  way.  It\r\n\r\nwill  take  a pragmatic approach, and pay close attention  to\r\n\r\nprevailing industry and market conditions. For example,  once\r\n\r\nthe  electricity market is operationally ready,  we  plan  to\r\n\r\ndivest our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npower-generating  companies: Power Seraya, Power  Senoko  and\r\n\r\nTuas Power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often suggested that if only the Government would\r\n\r\nsell  off  all the GLCs to somebody else, preferably cheaply,\r\n\r\nCinderellas  would  magically  become  beautiful  princesses.\r\n\r\nAlas,  this  only  happens  in  fairy  tales.  There  is   no\r\n\r\neffortless shortcut to upgrading and developing the GLCs, and\r\n\r\nthe  Govern-ment  cannot abdicate its responsibilities  as  a\r\n\r\nmajor shareholder.  Temasek Holdings is currently working out\r\n\r\na  charter  with  MOF that will spell out Temasek's  mission,\r\n\r\nrole  and  responsibilities. Temasek intends to publish  this\r\n\r\ncharter  soon  to make it clear how the Government  sees  the\r\n\r\nrole of the Temasek companies in the Singapore economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Restructuring Taxes, Creating Jobs</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee on Taxation, Wages, CPF and Land\r\n\r\n(\"the  ERC  Sub-Committee\"), chaired by  Senior  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  Tharman  Shanmugaratnam, published a  report  on  11th\r\n\r\nApril  on  \"Restructuring the Tax System for Growth  and  Job\r\n\r\nCreation\".  It  recommended  that  the  Government   make   a\r\n\r\nsignificant  immediate  reduction in corporate  and  personal\r\n\r\nincome tax rates, and that it lower both to 20% within  three\r\n\r\nyears. It also recommended that the Government raise the  GST\r\n\r\nrate  from  3%  to  5%  in 2003, and in  parallel  provide  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  offset package to help cushion the  impact  of\r\n\r\nthe  GST  increase  on Singaporeans, especially  lower-income\r\n\r\nhouseholds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts these key recommendations of the\r\n\r\nERC  Sub-Committee. Our highest priority is  to  create  good\r\n\r\njobs  for  Singaporeans.  To do this,  we  must  continue  to\r\n\r\nattract companies and talent to locate in Singapore and  grow\r\n\r\nour economy. But companies and talent are highly sensitive to\r\n\r\nthe  taxes they have to pay, especially direct taxes on their\r\n\r\nincome.  We  have  to bring down our corporate  and  personal\r\n\r\nincome tax rates to make ourselves more competitive. However,\r\n\r\nthis  will  cause  a  large shortfall in Government  revenue,\r\n\r\nwhich has to be made up one way or other. The most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffective way to do so is by raising the GST rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will lower the corporate and top personal\r\n\r\nincome tax rates to 20% by the FY 2004 Budget, as recommended\r\n\r\nby  the ERC Sub-Committee. This is barring a major change  in\r\n\r\nthe  economic  and  political  climate,  which  unfortunately\r\n\r\ncannot  be completely ruled out given the uncertain  regional\r\n\r\nand global environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee also made many other\r\n\r\nrecommendations on tax. Several of these have  been  included\r\n\r\nin  this  Budget. Others are still being studied by MOF.  All\r\n\r\nthose  found  to  be feasible will be included  in  the  next\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reducing Corporate Income Tax</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing the corporate income tax rate from 24.5% to 20%\r\n\r\nis  fundamental  to  strengthening our  competitiveness.  The\r\n\r\ncorporate income tax directly reduces the income of a company\r\n\r\noperating in Singa-pore. When companies compare the  relative\r\n\r\nattractiveness  of  investing  in  different  countries,  the\r\n\r\ncorporate  income tax flows straight through  to  the  bottom\r\n\r\nline. If we set our tax rate too high, we make it harder  for\r\n\r\ncompanies to make money, expand and create more jobs here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 15 years, the worldwide trend has been\r\n\r\ntowards  lower  corporate  and  personal  income  taxes.   In\r\n\r\naddition, countries often offer generous tax breaks, so  that\r\n\r\nthe effective tax rate that their companies pay is much lower\r\n\r\nthan  the  nominal  rate. For example,  Germany  reduced  its\r\n\r\ncorporate income tax rate last year from 40% to 25%;  a  huge\r\n\r\n15  percentage point cut. In the US, the corporate income tax\r\n\r\nrate  is  nominally 35%, but various provisions and loopholes\r\n\r\nreportedly enable some corporations to reduce their effective\r\n\r\nrate  to only 11%. Ireland, one of our competitors in Europe,\r\n\r\nplans  to cut its already low rate to a mere 12.5% next year,\r\n\r\nsupposedly without any tax breaks. Hong Kong's rate  is  only\r\n\r\n16%. These examples show just how fierce the competition  is.\r\n\r\nUnless we keep pace with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  competitors,  we  will inevitably lose  investments  and\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we enhanced our competitive position by\r\n\r\ngranting tax incentives that reduced or removed the corporate\r\n\r\nincome  tax  on  certain qualifying companies.  For  example,\r\n\r\nPioneer-status companies enjoy a tax holiday  for  up  to  10\r\n\r\nyears,  while  companies  granted investment  allowances  may\r\n\r\ndeduct  up  to  twice  their investment expenses  from  their\r\n\r\ntaxable income. But this strategy has its limitations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Firstly, it is harder to pick winners in a fast-changing economic environment. We need to encourage\r\n\r\nenterprise  across  the  board,  and  not  just  in   certain\r\n\r\ncompanies or certain sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Secondly, some sectors of the economy have\r\n\r\nbenefited more than others from tax incentives. For  example,\r\n\r\nour  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs),  most  of  them\r\n\r\nSingaporean-owned, often find it hard to qualify for the  tax\r\n\r\nincentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Thirdly, our tax incentives are gradually\r\n\r\nbecoming less effective. Our tax treaty partners are  seeking\r\n\r\nto remove tax-sparing provisions from the tax treaties. As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  benefits  that companies  enjoy  from  our  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  are  taken away by the other  tax  jurisdictions,\r\n\r\ndefeating the purpose of the incentive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be rationalising the current system\r\n\r\nof  tax incentives over the next few months. Later on  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech, I will describe improvements to our tax incentives to\r\n\r\nencourage the development of certain industries. But we  must\r\n\r\ncomplement these specific incentives with an across-the-board\r\n\r\nreduction in the corporate income tax rate, in order to  make\r\n\r\nthe tax burden on businesses in general as light as possible,\r\n\r\nand  make it worthwhile for companies to grow and create jobs\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reducing Personal Income Tax</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is equally important for us to lower personal income\r\n\r\ntaxes. The purpose is to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreward effort and achievement, promote entrepreneurship,  and\r\n\r\nattract and retain talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower personal income taxes allow Singaporeans to keep\r\n\r\nmore   of  their  hard-earned  income,  and  strengthen   the\r\n\r\nincentive  for  people to strive, create wealth  and  improve\r\n\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower personal income taxes also encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  If  people  are  to  risk  their  personal\r\n\r\nsavings  on some business venture, then they must be  allowed\r\n\r\nto keep more of the rewards of success. In business, the risk\r\n\r\nof  failure is always there. What drives entrepreneurs to run\r\n\r\nthe  risk  of  losing  their last  dollar  by  launching  new\r\n\r\nventures? The creative urge and the personal drive to achieve\r\n\r\nsomething  are certainly important. Beyond that,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nprospect of large personal rewards if a venture succeeds. One\r\n\r\nimportant reason, though not the only reason, why the US  has\r\n\r\nmore  entrepreneurs  than Europe is that US  personal  income\r\n\r\ntaxes are much lower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, reducing the personal income tax rate will help\r\n\r\nSingapore  attract  and retain talent. In knowledge-intensive\r\n\r\nindustries,  such  as  financial services,  the  business  is\r\n\r\nreally  the people in it. Where a business is located depends\r\n\r\non  where its key people want to live and work. If the people\r\n\r\nrefuse  to  move to Singapore, then the company  cannot  come\r\n\r\nhere.  And  when  such people consider where  to  live,  they\r\n\r\ncalculate  and compare how much tax they personally  have  to\r\n\r\npay  in  each  place.  A  low personal  income  tax  rate  is\r\n\r\ntherefore crucial for us to stand a chance of attracting such\r\n\r\npeople and businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal income taxes affect our home-grown talent too.\r\n\r\nIn the globalised economy, talent is highly mobile, and doors\r\n\r\neverywhere  are  open to talent. If Singaporeans  find  their\r\n\r\ntaxes  too onerous, some of them will move elsewhere. Without\r\n\r\ntalent, whether home-grown or imported, our economy will  not\r\n\r\nhum, new businesses will not start, and the prospects for all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will be bleak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Raising Goods and Services Tax</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowering corporate and personal income taxes will cost\r\n\r\nthe  Government a large amount of revenue. If we  reduce  the\r\n\r\ntax rates to 20%, in all, the Govern-ment will lose 9% of its\r\n\r\nannual revenue, or nearly 1.7% of GDP. We cannot afford  this\r\n\r\nloss;  we  have  to make up at least part of  it  from  other\r\n\r\nsources. That is why we must increase the GST rate from 3% to\r\n\r\n5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans have asked why we cannot simply accept\r\n\r\nthis  loss  of revenue, and leave the GST rate at  3%.  After\r\n\r\nall,  we have been enjoying comfortable surpluses, and should\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  accept smaller, but still large,  surpluses  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  The  problem is we do not expect large surpluses  in\r\n\r\nfuture.  Growth will be slower and more volatile than before.\r\n\r\nRevenues  will be less buoyant. But demands on the Government\r\n\r\nto  do  more and spend more are increasing. Even without  any\r\n\r\ntax  cuts, our surpluses are likely to shrink. With the large\r\n\r\ntax  cuts, we face a real risk of ending up with a structural\r\n\r\ndeficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A structural deficit means we will have a deficit in\r\n\r\nmost  years, whether the economy is booming or in  recession.\r\n\r\nThis will have serious consequences. One key reason the Singapore  dollar has been strong, and inflation has been low,  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  run a prudent fiscal policy. The  Government\r\n\r\nlives  within  its  means, and spends no more  than  what  it\r\n\r\nreceives. If the Govern-ment starts spending beyond  what  it\r\n\r\ngets,  and borrows or prints money to fund its spending,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar would go down. Inflation would go up.  Then,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'  hard-earned  savings  would  be  worth   less,\r\n\r\nincluding their CPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some argue that it is all right for us to run deficits\r\n\r\nregularly, because we can always draw on the reserves to make\r\n\r\nup  the shortfall. But that is not what the reserves are for.\r\n\r\nThe  reserves are to see us through rainy days,  to  be  used\r\n\r\nonly  in extremis, because Singapore produces no oil,  timber\r\n\r\nor gold that we can fall back on. Furthermore, we must not be\r\n\r\nmisled by the fact that all our previous recessions have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  short-lived.  We cannot discount the  possibility  that\r\n\r\nfuture  recessions will be prolonged and  deep  in  this  new\r\n\r\nenvironment. If we draw on our reserves routinely, they  will\r\n\r\nsoon  be  gone. In any case, using the reserves requires  the\r\n\r\nconsent of the President, who will very likely say \"No\",  and\r\n\r\nwith good justification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that we will never run deficits. In\r\n\r\ndifficult  years we will end up in deficit, as happened  last\r\n\r\nyear.  But  over  the whole business cycle, we  must  aim  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  modest  surplus. This is  only  possible  if  we\r\n\r\naccumulate  surpluses in good years to cover the deficits  of\r\n\r\nlean years. The Government therefore cannot operate on a tax-to-spend  basis.  Instead, we should build  in  a  margin  of\r\n\r\nsavings,  especially  given the more volatile  and  uncertain\r\n\r\nenvironment in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third argument against raising GST is that the Government should instead cut back on its expenditure. We will\r\n\r\ncertainly  do our best to be thrifty, especially  when  times\r\n\r\nare hard. But our government expenditure is already very lean\r\n\r\nat  18%  of  GDP.  In  contrast,  government  expenditure  in\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries is typically much higher - 30% to 40%  of\r\n\r\nGDP,  double ours.  Moreover, hard times are also times  when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  want  the Government to respond  with  generous\r\n\r\nhelping measures. Nevertheless, we will maintain a tight rein\r\n\r\non  the  cost of Government to ensure it stays below  20%  of\r\n\r\nGDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we examine the Government budget more carefully, we\r\n\r\nwill   see  how  difficult  it  is  to  make  deep  cuts   in\r\n\r\nexpenditure. Education is a priority area. It takes up 4%  of\r\n\r\nGDP.  If  we  reduce  this, we risk  under-investing  in  our\r\n\r\nchildren.  Even  if we could economise on  frills,  we  would\r\n\r\nstill  want to spend more on education. Indeed, MOE has  many\r\n\r\nmore worthwhile projects that it is keen to implement, if the\r\n\r\nmoney  can  be  found.  These include  upgrades  to  schools,\r\n\r\npolytechnics, the Institutes of Technical Education  and  the\r\n\r\nuniversities. Our health spending will rise as our population\r\n\r\nages, and as they demand higher standards of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhealth  care. MOT has multi-billion-dollar plans  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nour  public  transport infrastructure,  especially  the  rail\r\n\r\nnetwork.  Public  housing is yet another  big  area  where  a\r\n\r\nserious cut-back would adversely affect our quality of  life.\r\n\r\nFinally,  defence spending must be maintained if  we  are  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  enjoy peace and security. These  five  critical\r\n\r\nareas  - education, health, transport, housing and defence  - together comprise two-thirds of the Government's expenditure.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not realistic to cover the deficit by cutting\r\n\r\ngovernment spending without any negative impact on the  lives\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the ERC Sub-Committee recommended, and the\r\n\r\nGovernment has decided, to raise the GST to make up  for  the\r\n\r\ncuts  in  direct taxes. Increasing the GST rate  to  5%  will\r\n\r\nraise  0.8%  of GDP, and make up just half the  revenue  lost\r\n\r\nfrom the corporate and personal income tax cuts. Overall, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will still end up revenue negative by 0.9% of GDP,\r\n\r\nor  $1.2  billion  per year. This is a not  an  insubstantial\r\n\r\nloss,  but  it should still leave the Government with  modest\r\n\r\nsurpluses  over the medium term, provided we are careful  not\r\n\r\nto increase expenditures recklessly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for timing, the ERC Sub-Committee has recommended\r\n\r\nraising  the  GST  in 2003. By then the economy  should  have\r\n\r\nrecovered  further from last year's recession.  But  whatever\r\n\r\nthe  state  of the economy next year, the fact  that  we  are\r\n\r\ncoupling  a comprehensive offset package to the GST  increase\r\n\r\nmeans   that  the  increase  should  not  burden  Singaporean\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  choke  off  consumer  spending,  or  impact  the\r\n\r\neconomy. Our approach is to help Singaporeans adjust  to  the\r\n\r\nnew  realities, so that we can make essential changes to  our\r\n\r\ntax  structure  without delay, and forge  ahead  to  build  a\r\n\r\nstronger economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Offsetting the GST Increase</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans who pay income tax, the reduction in\r\n\r\nincome tax will offset, fully or partially, their increase in\r\n\r\nGST.  However many Singaporeans pay no income tax at all,  so\r\n\r\nthe higher GST will increase their tax burden unless we do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomething. In the longer term, they too will benefit from the\r\n\r\ntax  changes,  because  the  changes  will  promote  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth, create more jobs, and raise incomes across the board.\r\n\r\nIf  we do not bring down income taxes and raise the GST,  our\r\n\r\neconomy  may stagnate, unemployment may rise, and the  lower-income groups will be the hardest hit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will take time for the restructuring to create\r\n\r\ngrowth  and  prosperity.   Meanwhile,  the  Government   will\r\n\r\nimplement  a  comprehensive offset package that  will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  most households - of all income groups - are  no  worse\r\n\r\noff  during  a 5-year transition period. In other words,  the\r\n\r\npackage  will  offset completely at least 5 years'  worth  of\r\n\r\nadditional tax payable by most households. Indeed, we will go\r\n\r\nfurther  to  promise  that all lower-income  households  will\r\n\r\nreceive  at  least 5 years' worth of offsets. No lower-income\r\n\r\nhousehold will be left out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will announce the details of this year's corporate and\r\n\r\npersonal income tax cuts, next year's GST increase,  and  the\r\n\r\noffset package later in Part IV of my speech, when I set  out\r\n\r\nthe Economic Restructuring Package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Embracing the Future</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thrive in the different world we are in, we must\r\n\r\nconfront and accept the new realities. We must quickly  adapt\r\n\r\nourselves  to  the  changed environment,  and  to  many  more\r\n\r\nchanges  to  come. This Budget introduces changes  that  will\r\n\r\nhelp  the  Singapore economy to sustain growth over the  long\r\n\r\nhaul.  The  Government  will do  what  it  can  to  ease  the\r\n\r\ntransition,  but  Singaporeans must be ready  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nchanges. We have no other choice. At the same time,  we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue  to look out for one another, and to strengthen  our\r\n\r\nbonds  as  one  people. In an uncertain and  volatile  world,\r\n\r\nthese qualities are the best guarantee of a bright future for\r\n\r\nourselves and our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>PART II  THE FY 2002 BUDGET</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now turn to the Budget for the\r\n\r\nFiscal Year 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>FY 2001 Revised Budget Estimates</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me recap the FY 2001 Budget. I refer\r\n\r\nhonourable  Members  to  the  second  column  of  the  budget\r\n\r\nstatistics table in Handout 1 (below).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n Budget statistics for FY 2001 and FY 2002 (figures in $ bn)\r\n\r\n                     FY 2001       FY 2001      FY 2002\r\n\r\n                     Budget        Revised       Budget\r\n\r\n                                  Estimates\r\n\r\nTaxes and Fees        33.4           28.8         26.8\r\n\r\nNII Contribution       0.9           2.7          2.4\r\n\r\nOperating Revenue     34.3           31.5         29.2\r\n\r\nTotal Expenditure     28.1           27.7         28.3\r\n\r\nSpecial Transfers      1.9           5.3           0\r\n\r\nSurplus/(Deficit)      4.4          (1.4)         0.9\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Richard Hu presented the budget last year,\r\n\r\noperating  revenue was estimated at $34.3 billion  and  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  at  $28.1  billion. With  a  provision  of  $1.9\r\n\r\nbillion  for special transfers, the forecasted budget surplus\r\n\r\nwas a comfortable $4.4 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as Members can see from the third column of the\r\n\r\ntable, the sharp economic downturn reduced revenue from taxes\r\n\r\nand fees sharply by $4.6 billion to $28.8 billion. To make up\r\n\r\nfor  this,  we  raised the contribution from  Net  Investment\r\n\r\nIncome (NII) from the budgeted amount of $0.9 billion to  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional limit of $2.7 billion. Despite this, operating\r\n\r\nrevenue  still  fell  by $2.8 billion to $31.5  billion.  The\r\n\r\nrevised  total expenditure also fell, but by a  smaller  $0.4\r\n\r\nbillion   to  $27.7  billion.  Special  transfers,   however,\r\n\r\nincreased to $5.3 billion, mostly as a result of the two off-budget packages. Special transfers included $2.45 billion for\r\n\r\nthe   New  Singapore  Shares,  $500  million  to  the  Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund,  $500 million to the Eldercare  Fund,  and\r\n\r\n$200  million  to the Community Assistance Fund.  Even  after\r\n\r\ntapping  all revenue streams, we expect a budget  deficit  of\r\n\r\n$1.4  billion  for  FY 2001. However, this deficit  will  not\r\n\r\ncause a draw on past reserves,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause   it  can  be  funded  entirely  from  the  surpluses\r\n\r\naccumulated over the term of the previous government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Projected FY 2002 Fiscal Position</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the FY 2002 Budget proper, which\r\n\r\nis summarised in the last column of the table.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating revenue for FY 2002 is estimated at $29.2\r\n\r\nbillion, including a $2.4 billion contribution from NII. This\r\n\r\nis  $2.3  billion  less than the operating  revenue  for  the\r\n\r\nprevious year. We expect taxes and fees to be lower than last\r\n\r\nyear,  partly  because  they will be  based  on  last  year's\r\n\r\nearnings,  which were affected by the recession,  and  partly\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  rebates  and  tax  reductions  which   were\r\n\r\nannounced in the off-budget packages, but take effect in this\r\n\r\nfinancial year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, operating and development expenditures are\r\n\r\nbudgeted  at  $19.5  billion and $8.8 billion,  respectively.\r\n\r\nTotal expenditure in FY 2002 thus comes to $28.3 billion,  or\r\n\r\n$0.6 billion more than last year. Leaving aside, for now, any\r\n\r\nprovision  for special transfers and the impact  of  the  tax\r\n\r\nchanges to be discussed later, we can expect a modest  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus of $0.9 billion as our economy recovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is therefore not cutting back on\r\n\r\nexpenditure even though revenue has fallen. This is  to  fund\r\n\r\nurgently needed projects and services, and not because a  new\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has loosened the purse strings.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  budget  is  very tight.  This  underscores  the\r\n\r\ncritical  importance  of  spending only  on  essentials,  and\r\n\r\neschewing frills and extra-vagance.  My ministry has reminded\r\n\r\nall government departments of these constraints.  I also urge\r\n\r\nhonourable Members to bear them in mind when you request  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  be  more  generous  towards  your   cherished\r\n\r\nprojects in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Expenditure Priorities</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the Government's expenditure\r\n\r\npriorities.  I  refer  members to  the  chart  in  Handout  1\r\n\r\n(below).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740686.gif\">Sectoral Shares of FY 2002 Budget</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in previous years, the largest share of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  FY  2002  expenditure  budget  goes  to  Social\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  which  accounts for 45% of  total  expenditure.\r\n\r\nEducation,  Health and Community Development and Sports  will\r\n\r\nget  substantial  increases in their budget  allocation.  The\r\n\r\nincreases  support  the Government's emphasis  on  human  and\r\n\r\nsocial  capital.  These form the foundations  for  a  strong,\r\n\r\ncohesive  and resilient society. MOE will spend $2.6  billion\r\n\r\nin  operating  subsidies  to  educate  our  children  at  the\r\n\r\nprimary, secondary, pre-university and junior college levels.\r\n\r\nAnother  $1.7  billion  will  be  spent  on  university   and\r\n\r\npolytechnic  education,  as well  as  on  the  Institutes  of\r\n\r\nTechnical  Education. MOH will spend $1 billion on subsidised\r\n\r\nhealthcare  services  at  the 17  polyclinics,  64  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations and 13 public hospitals and healthcare\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  These  expenditures  will  be  targeted   more\r\n\r\nprecisely  at  lower-income households through means-testing.\r\n\r\nMeans-testing will also be applied to social assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next largest sector is Security and External\r\n\r\nRelations. The September 11 attacks have reminded us that  we\r\n\r\ncannot  take our security for granted. Despite the defeat  of\r\n\r\nthe Taleban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, global terrorism  is\r\n\r\nstill  an  active  force, with numerous  cells  and  networks\r\n\r\nendemic  in  many  countries, including in  our  region.  Our\r\n\r\nregional  situation is complex and unpredictable.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  let down our guard. To preserve and  enhance  our\r\n\r\ncapacity to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefend ourselves, the Government will devote 38% of the total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  budget  for  FY 2002 to  Security  and  External\r\n\r\nRelations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic Development is the third largest sector, at 12%\r\n\r\nof  the  total  expenditure budget. Our expenditure  in  this\r\n\r\nsector will enable us to invest in world-class infrastructure\r\n\r\nto   strengthen   Singapore's  competitive  position   as   a\r\n\r\ncompelling hub for global and regional businesses.  MOT  will\r\n\r\nspend  $1  billion  this  year on  road  upgrading  and  rail\r\n\r\nprojects, including the MRT Circle Line and the Sengkang  and\r\n\r\nPunggol LRT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to deregulate sectors of\r\n\r\nthe  economy  which  have  not been  fully  liberalised,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  electricity industry. This  will  sharpen  the\r\n\r\ninnovative  capacity of Singa-pore companies, and  make  them\r\n\r\nmore  efficient and competitive. We will help Singapore-based\r\n\r\nenterprises,  including SMEs, to upgrade  their  capabilities\r\n\r\nand  venture  abroad. We will also continue to encourage  new\r\n\r\ninvestments  and economic activities in order to develop  new\r\n\r\ngrowth  engines, and add depth and resilience to our economy.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, the Government will outsource services  to\r\n\r\nthe  private and people sectors wherever it is cost effective\r\n\r\nto do so.  Government expenditure in the Economic Development\r\n\r\nsector  will  continue  to  emphasise  worker  training   and\r\n\r\nupgrading. We have implemented many such programmes over  the\r\n\r\nyears.  The  second  off-budget package  last  year  enhanced\r\n\r\nemployment assistance and training programmes, including  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Development Fund and the People-for-Jobs  Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme.  Continuous skills upgrading is the best  form  of\r\n\r\njob security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not stint in its support for workers\r\n\r\nto  upgrade themselves. In preparing this Budget, I  reviewed\r\n\r\nthe range of training and upgrading programmes to see whether\r\n\r\nmore needed to be done. MOM and the trade unions told me that\r\n\r\nthere  was no shortage of money or training places. In  fact,\r\n\r\nmany places on the various training\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschemes  still  go unfilled. For FY 2002, there  are  100,000\r\n\r\ntraining places under the Skills Redevelopment Programme. MOM\r\n\r\nhas  also recently launched new retraining schemes,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  WorkSkills  Training Programme and  the  Self-Employment\r\n\r\nTraining  Programme. These should be sufficient. However,  if\r\n\r\nexisting programmes are filled, and the training places  need\r\n\r\nto  be  expanded, MOF will be ready to fund them,  the  tight\r\n\r\nbudget notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government Administration remains the smallest sector,\r\n\r\ncomprising  5.6%  of the total expenditure  budget.  We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to keep this the smallest sector in line  with  our\r\n\r\npolicy  to keep the central administration lean and trim,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  operational ministries can have the  bulk  of  the\r\n\r\nresources to deliver public services. We will improve service\r\n\r\ndelivery through the E-government initiative. By the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year,  all  government services that can  be  delivered\r\n\r\nthrough the Internet will be available online.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I will start  with  motor\r\n\r\nvehicle taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Motor Vehicle Taxes</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal disincentives have been a very effective means of\r\n\r\ncontrolling car ownership and usage. They have kept our roads\r\n\r\nsmooth-flowing  and  congestion free.  However,  our  current\r\n\r\nvehicle taxes are excessively skewed towards ownership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncosts  rather  than  usage charges. Moreover,  the  ownership\r\n\r\nlevies  are a complicated mix of taxes and fees that are  not\r\n\r\nfully rationalised. With the Certificate of Entitlement (COE)\r\n\r\nsystem  in  place, the Additional Registration Fee (ARF)  and\r\n\r\nexcise duty (ED) on cars are higher than they need to be. The\r\n\r\nroad  tax  is  also heavily biased against cars  with  large-capacity engines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government agrees with the ERC Sub-Committee that\r\n\r\nhigh  ownership cost is a blunt tool for controlling  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion.   Moreover,  it  creates   significant   economic\r\n\r\ndistortions. Car taxes are currently the heaviest taxes  paid\r\n\r\nby  upper-middle income households, far heavier  than  income\r\n\r\ntax.  High ownership costs have also distorted usage patterns\r\n\r\nby  encouraging  car  owners to drive frequently,  since  the\r\n\r\nexpensive car has already been paid for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government aims to strike a better balance between\r\n\r\nthe  ownership  and usage costs of a car, and to  rationalise\r\n\r\nthe various fees and charges. This will be done in stages, so\r\n\r\nas  not  to  destabilise the market. In  the  long  term,  we\r\n\r\nenvisage  that  the  ARF,  ED and  road  tax  will  still  be\r\n\r\nprogressive, but less so than now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reducing ARF and ED for Cars</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to reduce the ARF for cars\r\n\r\nfrom  140% of the Open Market Value (OMV) to 130% of the OMV.\r\n\r\nThe  ED  on cars will be cut from 31% of the OMV to  20%.  We\r\n\r\nthink that 20% is the appropriate long-term rate for ED,  and\r\n\r\ndo  not  expect to lower it further. However, the ARF can  be\r\n\r\ngradually  reduced  further  as the  market  adjusts  to  the\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Pegging PARF to ARF</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF)\r\n\r\nrebate  is  currently pegged to a car's OMV, instead  of  its\r\n\r\nARF.  This  was fine so long as the ARF rate did not  change.\r\n\r\nBut as we have progressively lowered the ARF, the PARF rebate\r\n\r\nhas become too\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarge relative to the ARF paid. We have therefore decided  to\r\n\r\npeg  the  PARF rebate to the ARF actually paid on  each  car,\r\n\r\ninstead  of the OMV. This way, the PARF will be automatically\r\n\r\nand proportionately reduced whenever the ARF is lowered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationalising Taxes on Cars and Taxis</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxis, being higher end public transport, are similar to\r\n\r\ncars,  and should be treated like cars in terms of ARF,  PARF\r\n\r\nand  ED.  The new ARF and PARF rates for cars will thus  also\r\n\r\napply  to taxis. However, the ED for taxis is currently lower\r\n\r\nthan  for cars. We will increase the ED for taxis from 7%  to\r\n\r\n10% of OMV. Nevertheless, the combined effect is to lower the\r\n\r\nownership charges on taxis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our eventual aim is to raise the ED on taxis to 20%, so\r\n\r\nas  to  equalise it with the ED on cars. However we  will  do\r\n\r\nthis  in  step  with future reductions in the ARF,  so  that,\r\n\r\noverall, the ownership taxes on taxis should continue to come\r\n\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reducing Road Tax</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road tax is part of the cost of owning a car, since\r\n\r\nit  is  payable regardless whether or not the car is actually\r\n\r\nused.  The  road tax for cars will be lowered,  typically  by\r\n\r\n20%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxis already enjoy a significant concession on road\r\n\r\ntax,  since their road tax is equivalent to that for a  1,766\r\n\r\ncc  private  car  under the new, reduced rates,  whereas  all\r\n\r\ntaxis have at least 1,900 cc engines. There will therefore be\r\n\r\nno change to the road tax for taxis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tables at Annex 1 (Cols. 727-728) shows these tax\r\n\r\nchanges for taxis and cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740727.htm\">Annex 1 - Changes to ARF, ED and PARF for Cars and Taxis (Cols. 727-728)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Issuing More Certificates of Entitlement</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes to motor vehicle taxes will reduce the\r\n\r\ncost of owning a car. However, unless we issue more COEs, the\r\n\r\nsavings  will feed through into higher demand for  cars,  and\r\n\r\nhigher  COE  prices, thereby negating the fall  in  ownership\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government announced in 1997 that 15,000 to 20,000\r\n\r\nadditional COEs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould be released if the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system\r\n\r\nproved  effective in managing congestion. We have decided  to\r\n\r\nrelease another 5,000 COEs in Quota Year 2002/2003 from  this\r\n\r\nreserve.  5,500  COEs  from this reserve  have  already  been\r\n\r\nreleased previously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in ARF and PARF will apply to COEs obtained\r\n\r\nfrom  the May 2002 bidding exercise onwards. The new ED rates\r\n\r\nwill  be effective tomorrow. The reduced road tax rates  will\r\n\r\ntake  effect from Sep 2002. The Land Transport Authority will\r\n\r\nannounce the details regarding the motor vehicle tax  changes\r\n\r\nand the extra 5,000 COEs for QY 2002/2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revising Car Park Charges</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the cost of owning and using a car is the cost\r\n\r\nof  providing a place to park it. At present, car park  space\r\n\r\nin  land-scarce Singapore is not properly costed. Our parking\r\n\r\ncharges within the city are much lower than cities elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhere  HDB  residential  parking is concerned,  the  existing\r\n\r\ncharges  do  not  cover the cost of building the  car  parks,\r\n\r\nleaving HDB with a large deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not logical to levy charges on other aspects of\r\n\r\nowning  and driving a car, while effectively subsidising  car\r\n\r\nparking costs for motorists. We therefore need to rationalise\r\n\r\ncar parking charges progressively.  I do not have the details\r\n\r\ntoday.  The HDB and the URA will announce the details later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Expanding Electronic Road Pricing</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more Singaporeans own cars, the cost of using a car\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  go up, where required, to prevent  congestion\r\n\r\nfrom  worsening  unacceptably. The ERP system  will  also  be\r\n\r\nexpanded  to  keep  our  roads  free  flowing.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  ERP is an efficient and precise  instrument  in\r\n\r\ncontrolling  congestion, if we rely more on ERP and  less  on\r\n\r\nownership  levies,  overall the  total  cost  of  owning  and\r\n\r\noperating a car should come down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singaporeans must bear in mind that the number\r\n\r\nof  additional cars that can eventually be put on  our  roads\r\n\r\nwill  be  primarily constrained by our lack of space.  Unlike\r\n\r\ncities such as New York or London, Singapore does not have  a\r\n\r\nlarge  hinterland  where city dwellers  can  use  their  cars\r\n\r\noutside the city. We will reduce ownership charges and enable\r\n\r\nmore Singa-poreans to afford cars. But cars in Singapore  can\r\n\r\nnever  be  as  cheap, and ownership of cars can never  be  as\r\n\r\nwidespread, as in these other cities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Foreign Worker Levy</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Worker Levy was reduced in 1999 to help tide\r\n\r\ncompanies over the 1998 economic downturn sparked off by  the\r\n\r\nAsian Financial Crisis. This concession was extended in  2001\r\n\r\nto  July this year because of the current economic recession.\r\n\r\nGiven  the uncertainty over economic recovery, the Government\r\n\r\nhas decided to extend the concession for a further six months\r\n\r\nuntil  December 2002. We will review the matter again towards\r\n\r\nthe end of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Liquor and Tobacco Taxes</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Raising Liquor Tax</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excise duty rates of certain liquors will be raised\r\n\r\nwith  effect  from today.

But as we focus on upgrading ourselves  to\r\n\r\nbecome   a   more   competitive  economy,   we   should   not\r\n\r\ninadvertently  become  less public-spirited  and  more  self-absorbed  individuals. We must continue to show our care  and\r\n\r\nconcern for fellow Singaporeans, and to contribute as members\r\n\r\nof  our  society to worthy community projects  and  services.\r\n\r\nThese  softer  aspects of life help to replenish Singa-pore's\r\n\r\nsocial capital, and keep our society strong and cohesive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans who do well have a responsibility to help\r\n\r\nfellow  citizens  who  are not as well off.  As  the  rewards\r\n\r\nincrease  for  the  most  successful Singa-poreans,  and  our\r\n\r\nincome  distribution stretches out, it becomes more important\r\n\r\nthat  those who do well contribute back to society.

In  the  current\r\n\r\nuncertain economic environment, voluntary organisations  face\r\n\r\nsome  difficulties in raising funds.

The\r\n\r\ncurrent  range of financial sector incentives is sufficiently\r\n\r\nbroad to promote high value-added activities. We have already\r\n\r\nmade   good  progress  in  attracting  global  and   regional\r\n\r\nfinancial activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, financial sector activities are highly mobile.\r\n\r\nAs  global  tax competition intensifies and drives tax  rates\r\n\r\ndown,  we  need  to provide more incentives  to  attract  and\r\n\r\nanchor   cutting-edge  activities  to  Singapore.  We  should\r\n\r\ntherefore  streamline and update our existing  incentives  to\r\n\r\nkeep them relevant and effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore enhance the tax incentives for the\r\n\r\nwealth-  and  asset-management industries to  encourage  more\r\n\r\nfunds  to be managed out of Singapore. There will be enhanced\r\n\r\nincentives  to  promote the growth of the derivatives  market\r\n\r\nand  bolster  Singapore's position  as  Asia's  treasury  hub\r\n\r\noutside Japan. Changes will be made to broaden and deepen our\r\n\r\nequity  capital  market.  I have also  decided  to  introduce\r\n\r\nconcessionary tax treatment for special reserves  set  up  by\r\n\r\ngeneral insurance companies for underwriting certain offshore\r\n\r\nrisks.  This will enhance Singapore's competitiveness  as  an\r\n\r\ninsurance centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the existing financial sector incentives will be\r\n\r\nmerged  into  an umbrella Financial Sector Incentive  scheme.\r\n\r\nThis will simplify the tax system and enable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh-growth  and  high  value-added financial  activities  to\r\n\r\nenjoy concessionary tax rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Promoting Enterprise Development</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improved Development and Expansion Incentive</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax incentives have long been an important instrument\r\n\r\nfor Singapore's economic development strategy. In particular,\r\n\r\nthe  Pioneer  Incentive,  which rewards  companies  with  tax\r\n\r\nexemption  on all qualifying income, has become a brand  name\r\n\r\nin  its  own  right.  Later, we introduced  the  Post-Pioneer\r\n\r\nIncentive to further anchor these companies to Singapore.  In\r\n\r\n1996,  this  was  replaced by the Development  and  Expansion\r\n\r\nIncentive (DEI).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to reduce the minimum tax rate under the\r\n\r\nDEI from 10% to 5% with effect from today. This will give our\r\n\r\neconomic  agencies  greater flexibility in administering  the\r\n\r\nDEI,  make it easier for companies to comply with the scheme,\r\n\r\nand  provide greater certainty for companies when they invest\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhanced Deduction for Research and Development Expenses</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we grant tax deductions for R&D expenses only\r\n\r\nfor  R&D  that  is conducted in-house, or else outsourced  to\r\n\r\napproved  R&D  organisations that conduct their  research  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This  is  to  build up R&D capabilities  locally.\r\n\r\nHowever,  companies in today's networked world harness  ideas\r\n\r\nand  talent from all over the world. Furthermore, as the  ERC\r\n\r\nSub-Committee   noted,  companies  carrying   out   R&D   are\r\n\r\nincreasingly  collaborating with offshore affiliates  or  the\r\n\r\nR&D outfits of other companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore decided to liberalise the tax\r\n\r\ndeductions  for expenses incurred for R&D that leads  to  the\r\n\r\nownership of intellectual property in Singapore. With  effect\r\n\r\nfrom  YA  2003,  single tax deduction  will  be  granted  for\r\n\r\nexpenses  incurred on R&D outsourced to any R&D organisation,\r\n\r\nwhether local or overseas.

It\r\n\r\nanchors  Singapore as a leading physical hub port for  global\r\n\r\ntrade.  This  is  due to a combination of factors:  extensive\r\n\r\nconnectivity, effective use of information-technology  and  a\r\n\r\npro-business   environment.  Nevertheless,   competition   is\r\n\r\nintensifying, not only from the leading maritime  centres  of\r\n\r\nthe world, but also from lower-cost newcomers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of an integrated approach to sustain Singapore\r\n\r\nas   a  competitive,  efficient  and  value-adding  logistics\r\n\r\ncentre,  we  will transform ourselves into a leading  supply-chain  management hub. We will go beyond providing  excellent\r\n\r\nphysical  port  infrastructure, such as  cargo  handling  and\r\n\r\nterminal  services, to become the nerve centre for the  \"mind\r\n\r\nand   management\"  driving  global  transport  and  logistics\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To attract these shipping leaders, I have decided to\r\n\r\nextend  the Approved International Shipping Enterprise Scheme\r\n\r\nand  enhance  its  attractiveness for international  shipping\r\n\r\ncompanies. The scope of the scheme will be expanded  and  its\r\n\r\neligibility criteria streamlined with effect from YA 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Incentives</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above measures, I will also introduce the\r\n\r\nfollowing tax incentives:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) With effect from YA 2003, the Unilateral Tax Credit\r\n\r\nScheme  for  services income will cover all  services  income\r\n\r\nremitted from all non-treaty countries;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Payments to international arbitrators will be\r\n\r\nexempt from withholding tax with immediate effect;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) With effect from 1st January 2003, dividends\r\n\r\nissued  by  companies with exempt income or income  taxed  at\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rates  will be tax-exempt  for  all  tiers  of\r\n\r\nshareholders, regardless of shareholding level;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The gross income of non-resident professionals\r\n\r\nwill  be  subject to a final income tax of 15% with immediate\r\n\r\neffect; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The movable assets of non-domiciles will be exempt\r\n\r\nfrom estate duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of these tax incentives are at Annex 5\r\n\r\n(Cols. 735-742).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740735.htm\">Annex 5 - Tax Incentives for the Financial Sector and Enterprise Development (Cols.  735-742)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>PART IV  THE ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING PACKAGE</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>A Package for a Different World</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key changes in this budget are the corporate and\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax cuts, the increase in GST, and  the  GST\r\n\r\noffset  package. These tax changes, together with the  offset\r\n\r\nmeasures, form a single economic restructuring package.  This\r\n\r\npackage is a critical element of our strategy to make  Singapore more competitive, and to create more jobs and prosperity\r\n\r\nfor Singa-poreans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Corporate and Personal Income Tax Cuts and GST Increase</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee recommended that the Government\r\n\r\ncut  corporate  and personal income tax rates  to  20%  in  3\r\n\r\nyears.  For  this  year, it recommended that the  Govern-ment\r\n\r\nmake \"significant immediate reductions\" in both corporate and\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax rates. We have considered carefully  the\r\n\r\nappropriate size of the immediate cuts, and the exact  timing\r\n\r\nof  the  GST  increase. We had to strike  a  careful  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the need to make a bold move now, and the  need  for\r\n\r\nfiscal  prudence in view of the uncertainties in the external\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From YA 2003, I have decided to cut the corporate income\r\n\r\ntax rate from 24.5%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  22%. This 10% reduction will save businesses $700 million\r\n\r\na year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also with effect from YA 2003, the top marginal personal\r\n\r\nincome   tax  rate  will  be  cut  from  26%  to  22%,   with\r\n\r\ncorresponding cuts in all income bands. This will reduce  the\r\n\r\ntax payable by most taxpayers by 13% to 16%, saving them $620\r\n\r\nmillion every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided to raise the GST rate from 3% to 5% from\r\n\r\n1st January 2003. The increase in GST is expected to raise an\r\n\r\nadditional $1.3 billion of tax revenue per year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an annual basis, the combined revenue loss from\r\n\r\ncutting  the corporate and personal income taxes to 22%  this\r\n\r\nyear  is  $1.32  billion, slightly more than  the  additional\r\n\r\nrevenue  of  $1.3  billion from raising  GST  to  5%.  In  my\r\n\r\njudgement,  this  strikes the right balance between  boldness\r\n\r\nand  prudence, and sets us on track to reduce both  corporate\r\n\r\nand personal income tax rates to 20% by the FY 2004 Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Restructuring Corporate Income Tax</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in corporate income tax will benefit all\r\n\r\ncompanies.   With   the  partial  exemption   of   companies'\r\n\r\nchargeable income since YA 2002, many SMEs already  pay  less\r\n\r\nthan  half  the  corporate income tax rate.  This  additional\r\n\r\nreduction will result in the SMEs paying effective tax  rates\r\n\r\nof  between 5.5% and 10%. Besides reducing the rate, we  will\r\n\r\nalso  restructure the corporate taxation system to  introduce\r\n\r\ntwo  features  recommended  by the ERC  Sub-Committee:  group\r\n\r\nrelief and a one-tier tax system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Group Relief</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations often organise themselves into multiple\r\n\r\nholding companies, subsidiaries and associates to reflect the\r\n\r\nstructure   of  their  business  and  to  limit  liabilities.\r\n\r\nSometimes corporations are required by law to set up separate\r\n\r\ncompanies  for  specific purposes. For  example,  to  protect\r\n\r\nbuyers, property developers are required to set up a separate\r\n\r\ncompany for each residential development project that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nundertake.  However, corporations are not allowed  to  offset\r\n\r\nthe  losses  of  one company against the taxable  profits  of\r\n\r\nanother  within the same group. Each company in a group  pays\r\n\r\ntax  as  a separate, stand-alone entity. As a result, setting\r\n\r\nup separate companies effectively raises the tax rate for the\r\n\r\nwhole group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee has recommended allowing group\r\n\r\nrelief  to  help  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Group  relief recognises  group  companies  as  a\r\n\r\nsingle economic entity by allowing the unutilised losses  and\r\n\r\ncapital allowances from one company to offset the profits  of\r\n\r\na related company in the same group. This is already the case\r\n\r\nin  most developed countries, including the US and the United\r\n\r\nKingdom (UK).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will accept the ERC Sub-Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommen-dation,  and  introduce a  loss-transfer  system  of\r\n\r\ngroup relief with effect from YA 2003. A group consists of  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  incorporated parent company and all its  Singapore\r\n\r\nincorporated   subsidiaries.   Two   Singapore   incorporated\r\n\r\ncompanies could also be members of the same group if  one  is\r\n\r\n75%  owned  by  the  other or both are 75% owned  by  another\r\n\r\nSingapore  incorporated  company.  Group  companies  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  transfer their current year  unutilised  capital\r\n\r\nallowances  and  losses. However, investment  allowances  and\r\n\r\nforeign losses may not be transferred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of group relief will lower the tax\r\n\r\nburden  on  companies,  and encourage  more  risk-taking  and\r\n\r\nenterprise. It will also help companies during recessions  or\r\n\r\nthe early years of new ventures, when they are likely to make\r\n\r\nlosses.  Companies  which  set  up  subsidiaries  for   risky\r\n\r\nventures will be able to enjoy the limited liability  benefit\r\n\r\nof    separate   subsidiaries,   and   still   offset   these\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries' losses against their own profits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change will cost the Government $170 million per\r\n\r\nyear.  As  for  the  ERC  Sub-Committee's  recommendation  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  consortium  relief and more complex  group  relief\r\n\r\nmeasures, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment will study these more carefully before making  its\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>One-tier Corporate Taxation System</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Sub-Committee recommended replacing the current\r\n\r\nfull  imputation  corporate taxation system with  a  one-tier\r\n\r\ncorporate taxation system. It argued that the current  system\r\n\r\ndiscourages  companies  with insufficient  dividend  franking\r\n\r\ncredits  from distributing dividends. Furthermore,  the  full\r\n\r\nimputation  system  is  not  well  adapted  to  sophisticated\r\n\r\nbusiness  transactions,  such as share  buy-backs  and  share\r\n\r\nborrowing and lending. MOF had to craft complicated tax rules\r\n\r\nfor  these transactions to meet concerns about tax avoidance.\r\n\r\nThis increased compliance costs for companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the Sub-Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendation.  We  will introduce  the  one-tier  corporate\r\n\r\ntaxation system with effect from 1st January 2003. Under this\r\n\r\nsystem,  the tax collected from corporate profits  is  final.\r\n\r\nSingapore  dividends are exempt. This will  greatly  simplify\r\n\r\nour   tax  code  and  reduce  the  cost  of  compliance   and\r\n\r\nadministration for companies. The one-tier system  will  work\r\n\r\nin  tandem  with group relief and the lower corporate  income\r\n\r\ntax  rate to make more profits available for distribution  as\r\n\r\ndividends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies will not be able to make full use of the\r\n\r\ndividend franking credits that they have accumulated  by  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  2003.  I  will therefore allow a  5-year  transition\r\n\r\nperiod  from  1st  January 2003 to  31st  December  2007  for\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  pay  franked dividends out of  any  unutilised\r\n\r\ndividend  franking  credits as of 31 Dec  2002.  During  this\r\n\r\nperiod,  shareholders will still be able to receive dividends\r\n\r\nwith credits attached.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-tier system will have the desirable consequence\r\n\r\nof allowing the unlimited flow-through of exempt dividends to\r\n\r\nall  tiers of shareholders, regardless of shareholding level.\r\n\r\nHowever,  companies that are still on the  imputation  system\r\n\r\nduring  the 5-year transition period will not be able  to  do\r\n\r\nso.  I  will  therefore allow these companies to flow  exempt\r\n\r\ndividends paid out of concessionary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome  to  all tiers of shareholders without restriction  on\r\n\r\nshareholding level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Restructuring Personal Income Tax</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in personal income tax rates will benefit\r\n\r\nall  taxpayers.

I have also taken the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  streamline,  and in some cases increase, personal  income\r\n\r\ntax  reliefs, and to simplify the tax structure  by  reducing\r\n\r\nthe  number of income bands. Let me deal first with  the  new\r\n\r\ntax structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Personal Income Tax Structure</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the significant reduction in the top personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax  rate,  we no longer need as many  tax  bands  as\r\n\r\nbefore. I have therefore decided to simplify the structure by\r\n\r\nconsolidating the existing 10 bands to 7.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, $250 of the $500 GST-related income tax\r\n\r\nrebate was incorporated into the individual tax structure  by\r\n\r\nexempting  the  first  $7,500 of an  individual's  chargeable\r\n\r\nincome  from tax. This year we will incorporate the remaining\r\n\r\n$250  GST-related income tax rebate, as well  as  the  $3,000\r\n\r\npersonal relief, which is enjoyed by all taxpayers, into  the\r\n\r\npersonal income tax structure. With these changes, the  first\r\n\r\n$20,000  of  an individual's chargeable income  will  not  be\r\n\r\ntaxed.

The UK and Ireland  already\r\n\r\nhave such schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the ERC's recommendation. We\r\n\r\nwill  create a new class of taxpayers called \"Not  Ordinarily\r\n\r\nResident\"  (NOR) taxpayers.  An NOR taxpayer will  be  exempt\r\n\r\nfrom  tax on income earned before he came here. A non-citizen\r\n\r\nNOR  taxpayer will also be exempt from tax on his  employer's\r\n\r\ncontribution to his overseas pension fund, to compensate  for\r\n\r\nthe  fact that non-citizens do not enjoy CPF tax relief.   In\r\n\r\naddition, an NOR taxpayer who spends at least 90 days a  year\r\n\r\noutside Singapore on business will pay tax only on his  total\r\n\r\nSinga-pore  employment income based on  his  number  of  days\r\n\r\nhere. This is subject to a floor tax rate of 10% on his total\r\n\r\nemployment  income.  It will help us to  attract  the  senior\r\n\r\nmanagement  of companies to use Singapore as their  base  for\r\n\r\nregional activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NOR scheme will take effect from YA 2003.

Our\r\n\r\nNSmen  spend precious time away from their work and  families\r\n\r\neach  year to build up their operational readiness, and  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  safe  and  secure.  This  is  a  heavy  commitment\r\n\r\nespecially during an economic downturn. To further  recognise\r\n\r\nthe  contributions of NSmen, I have decided to  increase  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  NS  reliefs by 50%. The amounts will  increase  from\r\n\r\n$2,000 to $3,000 for Active NSmen, from $1,000 to $1,500  for\r\n\r\nInactive  NSmen,  and from $500 to $750  for  the  wives  and\r\n\r\nparents of NSmen.

We\r\n\r\ntherefore set the rules to disallow parents who divorce  from\r\n\r\ncontinuing  to  claim the rebates. However, we have  received\r\n\r\nappeals  from  divorcees with children,  whose  rebates  were\r\n\r\ndiscontinued after they divorced. They pointed out that  they\r\n\r\ntoo needed support, perhaps more so than other parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government continues to uphold the value of\r\n\r\nmaintaining strong families. However, we also recognise  that\r\n\r\nwithdrawing  the  rebate  from divorcees  can  add  to  their\r\n\r\nalready  difficult burden. I have decided to allow  divorcees\r\n\r\nto  continue  to  claim their procreation  tax  rebates  with\r\n\r\neffect  from YA 2003.

The  Government  strongly   encourages\r\n\r\nfamilies  to look after aged parents in their own homes,  and\r\n\r\nonly  use old-age homes as a last resort. But this can  be  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  financial burden on the family, especially  for\r\n\r\nfamilies with few children to share the burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore introducing a handicapped parent relief\r\n\r\nof $3,000 on top of the normal parent relief with effect from\r\n\r\nYA 2003. Including the normal parent relief, the total amount\r\n\r\nof  relief granted to taxpayers taking care of their  parents\r\n\r\nwill  be:  $8,000 if the taxpayer is living with the  parent;\r\n\r\nand $6,500 if the taxpayer is not living with the parent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cost the Government $2 million per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Double Child Relief for Children Studying Overseas</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents may currently claim double child relief ($4,000)\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  a child who studies overseas.  The  original\r\n\r\npurpose   was   to  subsidise  the  overseas   education   of\r\n\r\nexpatriates' children. It was later retained because  of  the\r\n\r\nlimited   opportunities  to  pursue  tertiary  education   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However, the number of places in  local  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions  has  grown greatly over the  years.  It  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  necessary or justified to subsidise overseas tertiary\r\n\r\neducation.

The Government  will  introduce  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive package of measures to offset the  increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  GST.  These offsets will be enough to cover the increase\r\n\r\nin  tax  for  most households, and certainly for  all  lower-income households, for at least 5 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Offsets  for  Healthcare, Education and Service & Conservancy Charges</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans worry that a higher GST will increase\r\n\r\ntheir  medical bills, because hospital bills are  subject  to\r\n\r\nGST.  In  fact,  they  do  not  need  to  worry  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  provides  the hospitals  and  polyclinics  direct\r\n\r\ngrants  to offset completely the GST they have to pay on  all\r\n\r\nsubsidised healthcare services. With the increase in GST, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  increase  these  grants  to   restructured\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  polyclinics. Charges for  subsidised  medical\r\n\r\ncare will therefore not be affected at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will similarly absorb the GST payable on\r\n\r\neducation,  by increasing its subsidy to the state  education\r\n\r\nsystem.  And  it  will increase the subvention  to  the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  to  offset the GST payable on Service & Conservancy\r\n\r\nCharges (S&CC).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total annual cost of the increased subsidies is\r\n\r\nestimated at $29 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public Transport Fares</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council (PTC) is currently\r\n\r\nevaluating proposals from the transport operators  to  revise\r\n\r\nfares.

After  considering\r\n\r\ntheir  views,  the  likely increase in GST  to  5%,  and  the\r\n\r\nproposed cut in the corporate income tax, the PTC has decided\r\n\r\nthat there is no need to raise fares next year as a result of\r\n\r\nthe  GST increase. The transport operators have accepted this\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public Assistance and Singapore Allowance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the offset measures, very low-income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  may  need  more  help  to  cope  with  the  GST\r\n\r\nincrease.  The  Government will help  these  Singaporeans  by\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  Public Assistance rates, and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nAllowance paid to Government pensioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS and PSD are currently working out the proposals,\r\n\r\nand will implement the revisions in time for the increase  of\r\n\r\nthe GST rate next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Committee to Combat Profiteering</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the GST was introduced at 3% in 1994, it had\r\n\r\nminimal  impact on prices. The inflation rate rose marginally\r\n\r\nfrom  2%  to 3%, but it fell below 2% after 1994, and  stayed\r\n\r\nthere.  This year, inflation is projected to be zero or  even\r\n\r\nnegative.  In  this benign price environment, I am  confident\r\n\r\nthat  the  2  percentage  point  increase  in  GST  will  not\r\n\r\nsignificantly raise prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I appreciate the public concern over the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  undue  price  increases.  To  address   this\r\n\r\nconcern,  the  Government will set up a Committee  to  Combat\r\n\r\nProfiteering. The Committee will be chaired by  Mr  Chan  Soo\r\n\r\nSen,  Minister  of State in the Prime Minister's  Office.  It\r\n\r\nwill  deal with any complaints of profiteering or unjustified\r\n\r\nprice   increases.   It   will  work  with   the   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  and their advisors in all the  constituencies,\r\n\r\nand  especially  with the market committees and  shopkeepers'\r\n\r\nassociations,  to monitor the situation on  the  ground,  and\r\n\r\nencourage hawkers and shopkeepers to act responsibly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rebates for Service & Conservancy Charges and Rent</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current package of S&CC and rental rebates for HDB\r\n\r\nhouseholds was implemented last November to help lower-income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  cope  with the recession.   This  package  will\r\n\r\nexpire  in  March 2003. As part of the GST offsets,  we  will\r\n\r\ngrant  S&CC  and  rental rebates for 5 more years,  from  1st\r\n\r\nApril 2003 to 31st March 2008. The rebates will be maintained\r\n\r\nat   their  current  levels  in  the  first  year,  and  will\r\n\r\nthereafter  taper off gradually.  The Government  will  spend\r\n\r\n$340  million on this 5-year package. Further details of  the\r\n\r\npackage are at Annex 9 (Cols. 749-750).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740749.htm\">Annex 9 - Rebates for Service & Conservancy Charges and Rent (Cols. 749 - 750)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Restructuring Shares</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GST was introduced, the Government introduced tax\r\n\r\ncuts and a range of rebates, including income tax rebates, to\r\n\r\noffset its impact. However, the tax cuts over the last decade\r\n\r\nhave  resulted  in  the  majority of Singaporeans  paying  no\r\n\r\nincome  tax at all. Therefore, the Government has decided  to\r\n\r\ngive   out  Economic  Restructuring  Shares  (ERS)   to   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans as the major part of the GST offset package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERS are meant to help Singaporeans adapt to the\r\n\r\nstructural changes in the economy, especially the increase in\r\n\r\nthe  GST  rate.  They will be similar to  the  New  Singapore\r\n\r\nShares (NSS) distributed last November. The shares are  worth\r\n\r\n$1  each. They will earn annual dividends over 5 years,  from\r\n\r\n2004  to  2008. The dividends will be paid each year  on  1st\r\n\r\nMarch. The dividend rate will be a guaranteed minimum  of  3%\r\n\r\nper annum. In addition, bonus dividends equal to the real GDP\r\n\r\ngrowth rate of the preceding year, provided it is above zero,\r\n\r\nwill  be declared annually. The dividends will be in the form\r\n\r\nof bonus shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unlike the NSS, the ERS will be more evenly\r\n\r\ndistributed   among   all   Singaporeans,   since    economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring affects everyone. Those who live in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperties with Annual Values (AV) not exceeding $10,000 will\r\n\r\nget a basic allocation of 1,200 shares. This includes 90%  of\r\n\r\nhouseholds.  It covers all HDB flats except for a  few  units\r\n\r\nwhich  are  exceptionally large, as well as  smaller  private\r\n\r\nhomes  such  as  walk-up flats and flats in shop-houses.  The\r\n\r\nremaining  10%  of  Singaporeans staying  in  larger  private\r\n\r\nproperties,  with AVs above $10,000, will receive  a  smaller\r\n\r\nbasic allocation of 600 shares. They are likely to be earning\r\n\r\nhigher incomes, paying higher personal income tax rates,  and\r\n\r\nenjoying  significant savings from the  personal  income  tax\r\n\r\ncuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERS are meant to tide Singaporeans over the next 5\r\n\r\nyears.  But  the Government will be giving ERS out  in  three\r\n\r\nannual allocations starting from 1st January 2003.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, the distribution is front-loaded.  We are getting them\r\n\r\nearly.  Adult Singaporeans who have contributed at least  $50\r\n\r\nto  their  own  CPF  accounts between 1st  January  and  30th\r\n\r\nNovember this year will get their first allocation of  shares\r\n\r\non 1st January 2003. Those who do so in December will receive\r\n\r\ntheir shares on 1st February 2003. This is similar to the NSS\r\n\r\narrangement last year.  For each subsequent share allocation,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will similarly have to make a $50 contribution.\r\n\r\nThis  is not a co-payment for the shares, but a way to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the shares are not given to inactive accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSmen will receive bonus shares for their contribution\r\n\r\nto the security of Singapore. Active NSmen will get 200 bonus\r\n\r\nshares, while Inactive NSmen will get 100. NSmen will receive\r\n\r\nall  their bonus shares in the year they qualify.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, if you qualify in the second year, or the third  year,\r\n\r\nas  an  Active NSman, at that point, you will still get bonus\r\n\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens can cash in the shares with the Government for\r\n\r\n$1  per  share. They may cash in all the shares at any  time,\r\n\r\neven as soon as they are issued. There will be no requirement\r\n\r\nto hold part of the shares for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  minimum  period, unlike the New Singapore  Shares.  But  I\r\n\r\nencourage  Singaporeans to keep their ERS until maturity,  in\r\n\r\norder to earn the maximum amount of dividends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost of the ERS scheme is over $3.6 billion,\r\n\r\nor $1.2 billion per year over the next 3 years*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*Assuming  that all eligible citizens take up  their  shares,\r\n\r\nand all then hold their shares until maturity.\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Overall Impact of Economic Restructuring on Households</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now refer members to Handout 2 (Annex 10 (Cols.\r\n\r\n751-752)).   The  GST  offset package,  comprising  the  S&CC\r\n\r\nrebates,  rental  rebates,  and the  ERS  shares,  should  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to offset the net increase in taxes  a  household\r\n\r\nwill  pay  over  the next 5 years, at least. It  fulfils  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's promise that most households will not  be  worse\r\n\r\noff  during the 5 year transition period. The table at  Annex\r\n\r\n10   shows   examples  of  the  overall  impact  of  economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring on representative households.  If you  look  at\r\n\r\nthe  Handout,  you will see some examples.  Take  the  2-room\r\n\r\nflat.   Household  income  per year, 22,300;  additional  GST\r\n\r\npayable per year, estimated $373; there is no income tax,  so\r\n\r\nno  saving there; $373 extra GST; the rental and S&C  rebates\r\n\r\n$228,  Economic  Restructuring Shares for two adults  divided\r\n\r\nover  the  five years come to about $520 per year;  so  total\r\n\r\nannual benefits, $748, compared to additional tax of $373  it\r\n\r\nis  almost  double, which means that in fact, the package  is\r\n\r\nenough to pay for 10 years' worth of the 2-roomers' extra tax\r\n\r\nburden.   Similarly, for the others, for the 4-roomer,  seven\r\n\r\nyears; for the Executive HDB, six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20020503/20020503-HA-0740751.htm\">Annex 10 - Impact of Economic Restructuring Package on Households (Cols. 751 - 752)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, the offset package will cover at least 5\r\n\r\nyears' worth of additional tax payable for all flat sizes. In\r\n\r\nfact,  those  living in one- or two-room HDB  flats  will  be\r\n\r\ncovered for the next 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing how anxious Singaporeans are to find out how\r\n\r\nthis budget benefits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem,  my  ministry has created an online benefits calculator\r\n\r\nat             the             following             address:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.budget2002.gov.sg/offset.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Lower-income Households Guaranteed No Worse Off</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive as the offset package is, it may not cover\r\n\r\neveryone.    Each    household   has    slightly    different\r\n\r\ncircumstances. A few households may find that the package  of\r\n\r\noffsets,  rebates  and  ERS is insufficient  to  cover  their\r\n\r\nincrease in the GST. To help such households, we will have  a\r\n\r\nCitizens' Consultative Committee (CCC) Assistance Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this scheme, any household with an income below\r\n\r\nthe  median household income of $3,600 can apply to their CCC\r\n\r\nfor  assistance,  if  their package of S&CC  rebates,  rental\r\n\r\nrebates, and ERS shares does not fully offset their extra tax\r\n\r\nfor  at  least 5 years. If the CCC confirms that the  offsets\r\n\r\nindeed  fall short of the extra tax burden on that household,\r\n\r\nit will top up the difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set aside $3 million per year for 5\r\n\r\nyears  for  this scheme.  The scheme will be  overseen  by  a\r\n\r\nCommittee, to be chaired also by Minister of State  Chan  Soo\r\n\r\nSen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this CCC Assistance Scheme, we can promise that all\r\n\r\nlower-income  households will not be  worse  off  during  the\r\n\r\ntransition period, at least five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Overall FY 2002 Fiscal Position</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the entire package of offsets, rebates\r\n\r\nand  ERS will cost the Government $1,226 million in FY  2002.\r\n\r\nTaken  together with the other tax changes, we expect the  FY\r\n\r\n2002 fiscal position to turn from a modest budget surplus  of\r\n\r\n$900  million  to  a  small  deficit  of  $190  million.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment is able to finance this deficit from FY 2001 funds\r\n\r\nand therefore does not need to draw on past reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>PART V  CONCLUSION</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget lays the basis for our\r\n\r\neconomic  restructuring. The intensity of global  competition\r\n\r\nis  unprecedented. Our restructuring process will be  neither\r\n\r\neasy nor painless. But the world has changed, and we have  no\r\n\r\nchoice.  Hence,  the Economic Restructuring Package  includes\r\n\r\nboth  the tax changes to gear us for the future, and  also  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  set of offsets to help Singaporeans  adapt  to\r\n\r\nthe changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will put the Government in a tight fiscal\r\n\r\nposition  over the next few years. We can afford the  package\r\n\r\nonly  because  we  have been consistently prudent  in  fiscal\r\n\r\nmatters.   Many  countries  find  themselves  in   this   new\r\n\r\ncompetitive  environment,  but  few  are  in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  their taxes, offset the impact on their  people,\r\n\r\nand  prepare themselves systematically for the trials  ahead.\r\n\r\nWe  must continue to save in good years, and be prepared  for\r\n\r\ndifficult years every now and again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot predict how the global situation will develop,\r\n\r\nor  how quickly Southeast Asia will regain its stability  and\r\n\r\nconfidence.

HDB\r\n\r\nshop-owners are today faced with keen competition,  not  just\r\n\r\nlocally  but also overseas.  Since the eighties, new suburban\r\n\r\nshopping malls and mega stores have entered the local  retail\r\n\r\nscene,  and NTUC Fairprice's mega stores are but the  latest.\r\n\r\nThese  stores  provide the convenience of one-stop  shopping,\r\n\r\nusually  in air-conditioned comfort, within HDB estates,  and\r\n\r\nare hence popular with HDB residents.  Many Singaporeans also\r\n\r\ntravel   to  Johor  Bahru,  Kuala  Lumpur  and  other  nearby\r\n\r\ndestinations to shop for their groceries, personal  wear  and\r\n\r\nother   items  at  lower  prices.  In  the  current  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  domestic demand has also been  depressed  by  wage\r\n\r\ncuts and fear of job losses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against such a backdrop, it is inevitable that some HDB\r\n\r\nshop-owners  and  tenants will see a drop in their  business.\r\n\r\nTo  assist  them to tide through their current  difficulties,\r\n\r\nHDB  has  implemented various assistance measures,  including\r\n\r\nrental  rebates,  passing on property tax  savings  to  them,\r\n\r\nexercising  greater  flexibility  in  granting  approval  for\r\n\r\nchange  of use and trade, and allowing shop-owners to convert\r\n\r\nto  shorter leases or sublet their shops.  But in the longer-term,  HDB  shop-owners and tenants will have to  continually\r\n\r\nupgrade  their  business operations and  adapt  to  lifestyle\r\n\r\nchanges  and consumer preferences to survive.  They  need  to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  areas  such  as the use of  IT,  customer  service\r\n\r\nmanagement,   inventory  control  management   and   cashflow\r\n\r\nmanagement  in  their  business operations.   The  Standards,\r\n\r\nProductivity  and Innovation Board (SPRING)  and  the  Retail\r\n\r\nPromotion Centre have in place various schemes to help  them.\r\n\r\nUltimately,  whether a shop survives and thrives depends  not\r\n\r\non  how much assistance the Government gives, but whether the\r\n\r\nshop can attract and retain its customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, not all is gloom and doom. It is not\r\n\r\ndifficult for HDB shops to find their own niche and develop a\r\n\r\nbase  of  loyal  customers,  because  there  will  always  be\r\n\r\nresidents  who,  for reasons of convenience  or  familiarity,\r\n\r\nstill  prefer  to  patronize  HDB  shops  rather  than  large\r\n\r\nshopping  malls  and mega marts. Due to  the  size  of  their\r\n\r\noperations, it is also easier for HDB shopkeepers to  provide\r\n\r\npersonalized  services  to  their  customers.   Sheng   Siong\r\n\r\nSupermarket  is an example of a HDB shop which  has  upgraded\r\n\r\nits  business  operations and done very  well,  despite  keen\r\n\r\ncompetition from bigger players like NTUC Fairprice and  Cold\r\n\r\nStorage.  HDB shops should also consider banding together  to\r\n\r\nform   \"commercial   streets\"  to  attract   shoppers.    The\r\n\r\nshopkeepers in Marine Parade Town Centre, Chong Pang City and\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  Town Centre who have worked so, have demonstrated\r\n\r\nthat this is a worthwhile and workable idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROTECTION FOR REMITTING MONEY OVERSEAS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  Minister  for  Finance (a) how his Ministry  intends  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  interest of the public when  they  remit  their\r\n\r\nmoney overseas through licensed remittance companies and  (b)\r\n\r\nwhether  his Ministry will review the existing rules  with  a\r\n\r\nview to bring those rules in line with those made for banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) took over the\r\n\r\nlicensing  of  remittance  agents  from  the  Controller   of\r\n\r\nExchange Control in 1971.  When exchange controls were lifted\r\n\r\nin  1978, remittance agents continued to be licensed  by  MAS\r\n\r\nunder  a  new  Money-Changing and Remittance  Businesses  Act\r\n\r\n(MCRBA).  The  object of the licensing  regime  is  aimed  at\r\n\r\nexcluding   undesirable   persons   from   conducting   these\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remittance industry has grown over the years, but it\r\n\r\nremains  a  traditional  business, with  many  small  players\r\n\r\noperating on the basis of relationship and trust.   Many  are\r\n\r\nsole   proprietorships  or  family-owned  partnerships  which\r\n\r\ncannot  institute the same degree of internal  controls  that\r\n\r\nlarger financial institutions like banks insist upon.   Also,\r\n\r\nremittance   houses  often  use  parties  such  as   friends,\r\n\r\nrelatives, employees and unregulated overseas agents  instead\r\n\r\nof   banks  to  deliver  funds  to  designated  beneficiaries\r\n\r\noverseas. Such is the nature of the remittance business. This\r\n\r\nis  why  it  is  difficult to introduce measures  to  enhance\r\n\r\nsignificantly the safety and soundness of remittance  houses.\r\n\r\nMany  countries  have  chosen not to regulate  this  type  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful study, MAS has concluded that introducing\r\n\r\nnew  measures or raising the statutory deposit could give the\r\n\r\npublic  a  false  sense  of confidence in  remittance  houses\r\n\r\nwithout  significantly improving their safety and  soundness.\r\n\r\nIn  the event of losses, a higher statutory deposit would not\r\n\r\nguarantee  recovery of a significantly larger  proportion  of\r\n\r\nthe  losses.   It is therefore important for  the  public  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the nature and process of the remittance business,\r\n\r\nand  weigh the benefits and risks of using remittance  houses\r\n\r\nagainst  safer but perhaps less convenient channels  provided\r\n\r\nby banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will continue to conduct background checks on\r\n\r\napplicants  before it grants them remittance  licences.   MAS\r\n\r\nwill  also  continue to monitor remittance houses' compliance\r\n\r\nwith  existing  rules and regulations, and, where  justified,\r\n\r\nwill  impose fines on errant licensees.  In serious cases  of\r\n\r\nirregularities or non-compliance, MAS will consider  revoking\r\n\r\nor  not  renewing licences. MAS will also refer  cases  where\r\n\r\nfraud occurs or is suspected to the Police for investigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a cash business, the remittance industry should\r\n\r\nideally  be  required to have control structures  similar  to\r\n\r\nbanks.   As  far  as is practicable, the MCRBA  does  require\r\n\r\nremittance  houses to institute some basic control  features,\r\n\r\neg,  audits  performed by an external auditor, submission  of\r\n\r\naudited   accounts  and  auditors'  findings  to   MAS,   and\r\n\r\nseparation  of  remittance  funds  from  other  accounts   of\r\n\r\nlicensees.   However,  it is not feasible  to  require  these\r\n\r\noften small, one-man or family-owned operations to adopt most\r\n\r\nof  the  important control features found in banks, including\r\n\r\ncorporate  governance  structures or  sophisticated  internal\r\n\r\ncontrol systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons cited earlier, MAS has, after a review,\r\n\r\ndecided  not  to  amend  the  MCRBA.
