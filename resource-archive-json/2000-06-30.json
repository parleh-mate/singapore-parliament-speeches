This means that taxi companies\r\n\r\nnow  have autonomy to set taxi fares without needing to  seek\r\n\r\napproval  from  the  PTC. They now have more  flexibility  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  differentiated and niche services and  to  respond\r\n\r\nmore   quickly   to   changes  in  the  environment   through\r\n\r\ndifferential  pricing strategies. The aim was  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nforces of demand and supply to determine the pricing of  taxi\r\n\r\nservices  that  would optimise the utilisation  of  the  taxi\r\n\r\nfleet.  With  deregulation, taxi companies have  to  consider\r\n\r\ncarefully and individually decide on fare revisions based  on\r\n\r\ntheir pricing strategy and supply-demand considerations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi companies have to price their services at a fair\r\n\r\nlevel,  taking into consideration, among other  factors,  the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  their services, cost of providing the  services,\r\n\r\nearnings  of  taxi  drivers,  competition  from  other   taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies and other modes of transport, the need to  generate\r\n\r\nadequate  returns  to  pay for vehicle  replacement,  and  to\r\n\r\ninvest in expansion and upgrading. Commuters are in the  best\r\n\r\nposition to decide whether taxi fares are set too high or too\r\n\r\nlow. If taxi fares are set too high, the demand will drop and\r\n\r\ntaxi  companies  will not be able to operate  their  business\r\n\r\nprofitably.   Conversely, if fares are set  too  low,  supply\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to match demand and service standards  will\r\n\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deregulation of taxi fares therefore serves to\r\n\r\noptimise  the utilisation of resources in meeting the  demand\r\n\r\nfor  taxi  services.  Commuters stand to gain as  it  ensures\r\n\r\nthat the pricing of taxi services is competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fare deregulation, how each dollar of the taxi fare\r\n\r\nis  distributed is determined by the taxi companies.  We  can\r\n\r\nexpect that, to retain drivers in this highly competitive and\r\n\r\ntight labour market, taxi companies will have to enable their\r\n\r\ndrivers to earn a decent income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CERTIFICATE OF ENTITLEMENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Review of categorisation)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and Information Technology, in  view  of  the\r\n\r\ntrend that has emerged from the converging of Certificate  of\r\n\r\nEntitlement  prices,  if  his Ministry  will  reconsider  and\r\n\r\nreview  the categorisation of COEs, in order to preserve  and\r\n\r\nsupport  a system in which car buyers will have more  choices\r\n\r\nand the ability to opt for smaller capacity cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ncan I ask the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nClerk  of  Parliament to distribute the handout?  [Copies  of\r\n\r\nhandout distributed to hon. Members].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) categories for\r\n\r\nsmall  and  medium-sized cars were merged into one  category,\r\n\r\nCategory A, in May 1999, following a review by the Government\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Committee.  The  Committee  had   noted   that\r\n\r\nideally,  there  should  only be one category  of  COEs,  and\r\n\r\nrecommended  the  merger of the two COE  categories  to  also\r\n\r\naddress  the  concern that the COE quota for small  cars  was\r\n\r\ndeclining  while their COE prices were not greatly  different\r\n\r\nfrom those for medium-sized cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger of the two categories to form a larger quota\r\n\r\nhas  helped  to  stabilise COE prices. This does not  however\r\n\r\nmean  that the COE for smaller cars will be cheaper than that\r\n\r\nfor  bigger  cars, because price is a function of demand  and\r\n\r\nsupply.  Latest prices for Category B COEs for cars more than\r\n\r\n1,600  cc  against that for Category A COEs for  cars  up  to\r\n\r\n1,600  cc bear this out. The COE price of Category A is close\r\n\r\nto  and sometimes higher than that of Category B. This is  in\r\n\r\nspite  of the fact that the monthly quota for Category A,  as\r\n\r\nit stands now, is 2,617, which is more than twice the size of\r\n\r\nthe quota for Category B, which is 1,153.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, combining the former COE Categories 1 and 2 into\r\n\r\none category for all cars with engine capacity up to 1,600 cc\r\n\r\nhas  given car buyers greater flexibility to decide what cars\r\n\r\nto  buy based on affordability. The fact that more choose  to\r\n\r\nbuy  at  the higher cc end of this category reflects consumer\r\n\r\npreference  for such cars. This is notwithstanding  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  other cheaper, smaller  cc  models  in  the\r\n\r\ncategory which are more affordable. As a matter of fact,  the\r\n\r\nprices of some small cars have not changed much, compared  to\r\n\r\nthe  first quarter of 1999 before the two COE categories were\r\n\r\nmerged.  I have distributed to Members some data to show  the\r\n\r\ncomparison  of car prices to illustrate what I mean.  If  you\r\n\r\nlook  at  Table 1, generally, the prices for small  cars  are\r\n\r\nlower  than prices for medium-sized cars.  When you  look  at\r\n\r\nTable 3, comparing the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncar  prices, say, for small cars before and after the merger,\r\n\r\nyou can see that the changes are not much. Some have gone up,\r\n\r\nsome  have  come down.  The reality is that car  buyers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to benefit from the merger of the two  categories\r\n\r\nand  they  are exercising their preferred decision.  More  of\r\n\r\nthem appear to be opting for the bigger, though slightly more\r\n\r\nexpensive models, rather than the cheapest models within  the\r\n\r\nsame COE category.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of motor dealers, they have responded to the\r\n\r\nchange  in demand pattern by adjusting the range and  numbers\r\n\r\nof  car  models  they  import for the Singapore  market.  The\r\n\r\ndecision  to bring in fewer small car models is a  reflection\r\n\r\nof  the  shrinking demand for smaller cars, even though  such\r\n\r\ncars are still, as I have said earlier, generally cheaper and\r\n\r\nhence more affordable than the bigger cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owning a car is not a basic need. There is no reason why\r\n\r\nGovernment  should intervene and arbitrarily  decide  on  the\r\n\r\nmarket mix of the car population in Singapore. We should  not\r\n\r\ninfluence the type of cars buyers should choose. It  is  best\r\n\r\nleft to car buyers how much they are willing to pay for a COE\r\n\r\nand  what  type of cars they want to purchase. From the  land\r\n\r\ntransport point of view, all cars, regardless of the size  of\r\n\r\ntheir  engine capacity, occupy the same amount of road  space\r\n\r\nwhen moving.  Hence, traffic engineers have assigned all cars\r\n\r\nthe  same Passenger Car Unit (PCU) rating of 1. It is not the\r\n\r\nintent of the COE scheme to address the social issue of price\r\n\r\nprogressivity. This issue is addressed through the Additional\r\n\r\nRegistration Fee (ARF) and customs duty which are  pegged  to\r\n\r\nthe  Open Market Value (OMV) of the vehicle, and the road tax\r\n\r\nstructure which is based on the engine capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the current COE trends, some have expressed\r\n\r\nthe  view that Government should move towards merging all car\r\n\r\ncategories  into one broad category. The COE categories  were\r\n\r\nrestructured  just  over a year ago. We will  be  introducing\r\n\r\nopen bidding for COEs later this year. It is best that we let\r\n\r\nthe system stabilise and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nobserve  the  price trends of COEs and consumer  preferences.\r\n\r\nHence, the Government has no plans at this stage to merge the\r\n\r\ntwo car categories into a single category.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would just\r\n\r\nsimply  like  to ask the Minister of State that, albeit  that\r\n\r\ncars  are not a basic need, they do form a very real part  of\r\n\r\nthe aspirations of many Singaporeans and, therefore, the LTA,\r\n\r\nas  it further studies refinements and hopefully enhancements\r\n\r\nfrom  the public point of view, takes due consideration  that\r\n\r\nit  tries not to contribute more to the very real and growing\r\n\r\nfeeling among ordinary Singaporeans that more and more things\r\n\r\nare  getting  out  of reach of the little guy  and  of  young\r\n\r\npeople starting out in their careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, we understand that the\r\n\r\naspiration  to own cars is there and, of course,  subject  to\r\n\r\nthe  congestion objective, the Government will  try  to  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  fulfill their aspiration.  As I  said,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  there is progressivity also in the ARF and the  road\r\n\r\ntax,   and  the  COE  is  not  intended  to  accentuate  that\r\n\r\nprogressivity. But what we can do is wherever we can, subject\r\n\r\nto  congestion level, we will try to give more COEs and  that\r\n\r\nwill lower the COE prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOREIGN DOMESTIC WORKERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Complaints on ill-treatment and abuse)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if\r\n\r\nhe  will give figures of complaints received for the last two\r\n\r\nyears  on ill-treatment and abuse of foreign domestic workers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and state the actions taken by the  authorities\r\n\r\nin addressing these complaints.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in 1997, the Singapore Police Force  recorded\r\n\r\n157 substantiated cases of foreign domestic worker abuse.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a general policy, our\r\n\r\npublic  housing programme requires flat applicants to form  a\r\n\r\nfamily nucleus to qualify for the purchase of a new flat from\r\n\r\nHDB.  This is in line with the philosophy that the family  is\r\n\r\nthe basic building block of a strong and stable society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to meet the housing needs of some Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  remain single and would like to live on their  own,  the\r\n\r\nHDB  has  in place two schemes, namely, the Single  Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizen  Scheme  and  the Joint Singles  Scheme.   Under  the\r\n\r\nSingle Singapore Citizen Scheme, singles who are 35 years and\r\n\r\nabove  can buy resale 3-room or smaller flats located outside\r\n\r\nthe   urban  areas.   The  3-room  flats  provide  more  than\r\n\r\nsufficient space for singles who live on their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Joint Singles Scheme, two eligible single\r\n\r\ncitizens  can  jointly  purchase resale  flats  of  any  size\r\n\r\nanywhere in Singapore.  The CPF Housing Grant Scheme is  also\r\n\r\nopen  to  first-timer single applicants who are 35  years  or\r\n\r\nmore.  Today, the grant is $11,000 under the Single Singapore\r\n\r\nCitizen  Scheme  and double that, $22,000,  under  the  Joint\r\n\r\nSingles Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as there are sufficient avenues to meet the housing\r\n\r\nneeds  of singles, I think for now  there is no need to allow\r\n\r\nsingles to purchase new 4-room flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about downgrading during the first 5-year occupation period. In general, HDB requires lessees to\r\n\r\noccupy  their flats for at least five years before  they  can\r\n\r\nsell  them  in the open market.  This is to deter speculation\r\n\r\non HDB flats, which are heavily subsidized.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are two options available to HDB lessees\r\n\r\nif  they need, for whatever reasons,  to downgrade to smaller\r\n\r\nflats  within the 5-year occupation period.  First, they  can\r\n\r\nsurrender  their  existing flat to HDB and  then  purchase  a\r\n\r\nresale  flat  from  the  open market; or  they  can  mutually\r\n\r\nexchange  their  existing flat with another lessee,  provided\r\n\r\nboth parties have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompleted  a  minimum 1-year occupation period and  meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about raising the income ceiling for\r\n\r\nrental  flats.  Sir, HDB reviews the income ceiling regularly\r\n\r\nto  take into account changes in household incomes.   In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  rental flats, raising the ceiling from the  current\r\n\r\n$800  per  month  to  $1,000 per month  may  be  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  objective  to  help  as  many  Singaporeans  as\r\n\r\npossible  become home owners. Nevertheless, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nassure the House that HDB does exercise flexibility to  allow\r\n\r\nfamilies  with incomes exceeding $800 per month to  rent  HDB\r\n\r\nflats   at   subsidized  rental  if  there   are   mitigating\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  HDB also has several assistance schemes, such\r\n\r\nas  Sale of Flats to Sitting Tenants, Sale of 3-Room Buy Back\r\n\r\nFlats  and Rent and Purchase Scheme, to help the lower income\r\n\r\ngroups to own HDB flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WORKERS FROM LOWER-INCOME GROUP</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Training grants)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  if  his  Ministry has any plans to provide  further\r\n\r\nincentives  to workers from the lower-income group  to  enrol\r\n\r\nfor training courses to upgrade their skills, for example, by\r\n\r\ngiving  an  appropriate level of training grants directly  to\r\n\r\nthese workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir, worker\r\n\r\ntraining  is  critical for our economic  competitiveness  and\r\n\r\nsuccessful  transformation  into a  knowledge-based  economy.\r\n\r\nWith economic restructuring, the types of jobs available  and\r\n\r\nthe  skills  needed to perform these jobs  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nchange.   These  new  jobs will require  higher  skills.  For\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  especially  lower  income  and  less  educated\r\n\r\nworkers,  continual skills upgrading is the key  to  ensuring\r\n\r\nemployability and enhancing incomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Government has recently committed additional\r\n\r\nfunds  to  motivate  and  facilitate  skills  upgrading.   In\r\n\r\nFebruary  this year, my Ministry established a  $200  million\r\n\r\nManpower  Development  Assistance Scheme  (MDAS)  to  support\r\n\r\nmanpower  development initiatives over the next  five  years.\r\n\r\nOf  the $200 million, $90 million has been set aside for  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment Programme (SRP),  aimed  at  retraining\r\n\r\nlower skilled workers. This is in addition to the $50 million\r\n\r\ncommitted to the programme in 1998. Under the SRP, we aim  to\r\n\r\nprovide  training  for  100,000  workers  over  five   years.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have about 26,000 workers who have completed or\r\n\r\nare  undergoing SRP training. Companies sending their workers\r\n\r\nfor training receive generous grants, covering up to 100%  of\r\n\r\ncourse  fees  and 85% of absentee payroll.  SRP  also  covers\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  unemployed or those who initiate  their  own\r\n\r\ntraining. They can sign up for the training programme through\r\n\r\nthe CDCs and self-help groups. Already 6,700 Singaporeans had\r\n\r\ndone so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also generously supported the\r\n\r\nEducation and Training Fund (ETF) set up by the NTUC  with  a\r\n\r\nmatching  grant  of $3 for every $1 raised  by  NTUC.   Since\r\n\r\n1998,  the Government has committed $15 million to the  fund.\r\n\r\nThe ETF supports training for union members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, with effect from 1st July 2000, the salary\r\n\r\ncap  for  the  Skills Development Levy will  be  raised  from\r\n\r\n$1,000  to  $1,500.   The change will raise  the  total  levy\r\n\r\ncollection from the current level of $20 million  a  year  to\r\n\r\nabout  $48 million a year.  This will significantly  increase\r\n\r\nthe  training  grants  that can be made available  under  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Development  Fund.  Apart from  supporting  employer-based  training,  the SDF also operates a Surrogate  Employer\r\n\r\nScheme.  Under the scheme, Singaporeans who sign for training\r\n\r\nthrough  the  self-help groups or CDCs can also benefit  from\r\n\r\nSDF's training grants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands, I believe that we have sufficient\r\n\r\nresources to fund skills upgrading for lower income  workers,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is employer-based or individual-initiated.

To  avoid\r\n\r\ncreating  the wrong perception that the Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nwas  profiting  from such sales, the GLCs will  only  take  a\r\n\r\nsmall stake in these assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A S$400 million loan financing scheme to encourage\r\n\r\nSingapore   companies   to  look  for   commercially   viable\r\n\r\nopportunities in Indonesia.

The  sale  was   reported\r\n\r\nfavourably by the international media and both IBRA  and  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Government have noted the positive role played  by\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Temasek Holdings teamed up with two\r\n\r\nleading  palm  oil  companies  -  Golden  Agri-Resources  and\r\n\r\nCargill - to own, develop and operate oil palm plantations in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.

The\r\n\r\nparticipating member is permitted to draw on the facility for\r\n\r\nup to a maximum amount of twice their contributions, which is\r\n\r\nUS$80 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me now to explain a little about the mechanics of\r\n\r\nthis  swap  arrangement.   A member  country  with  liquidity\r\n\r\nproblems or needs can exchange or swap its local currency for\r\n\r\nUS dollars provided by the other member countries of the swap\r\n\r\narrangement.   A  currency swap is effected  through  a  spot\r\n\r\npurchase of US dollars against the domestic currency  of  the\r\n\r\nborrower, accompanied by a forward sale of US dollars by that\r\n\r\nborrower  against the same amount of domestic currency.   The\r\n\r\ninterest on the swap facility is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifference  between  the  forward and  spot  exchange  rates,\r\n\r\ndetermined  by  the interest rate of the Eurodollar  deposits\r\n\r\nfor  the relevant period of the Arrangement as quoted by  the\r\n\r\nBank  of International Settlements in Basle, two working days\r\n\r\nprior to the value date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A swap transaction shall be for a period of one, two or\r\n\r\nthree  months,  and  may be renewed once  for  a  maximum  of\r\n\r\nanother three months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swap facility is made available only to the central\r\n\r\nbanks  and  monetary  authorities of the participating  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries.  A participant may choose not to participate in  a\r\n\r\nswap transaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"Chiang Mai\" Initiative was an outcome of the ASEAN\r\n\r\nplus three Finance Ministers Meeting held in Thailand in  May\r\n\r\nthis year, and was in recognition of the need to establish  a\r\n\r\nregional   financing   arrangement  to  supplement   existing\r\n\r\ninternational  facilities.  The \"Chiang Mai\"  initiative  can\r\n\r\nessentially be broken down into two parts:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An expansion of the ASEAN Swap Arrangement to\r\n\r\ninclude all ASEAN countries; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The establishment of a network of bilateral swap\r\n\r\nand repurchase agreement facilities among the ASEAN countries\r\n\r\nand the plus three countries of China, Japan and the Republic\r\n\r\nof Korea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the details of the Initiative and its\r\n\r\nimplementation  are not yet finalised, and  are  still  being\r\n\r\nworked out by the central bank officials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked what impact this swap arrangement will\r\n\r\nhave  on Singapore's reserves.  In short, there will be none.\r\n\r\nThe  currency  swap  arrangement is a form of  collateralised\r\n\r\nshort-term loan.  It is no more than a conversion of one form\r\n\r\nof  asset  to  another,  that is,  from  US  dollars  to  its\r\n\r\nequivalent in another currency, with the commitment that  the\r\n\r\ntransaction  will  be  reversed  at  a  future  date   at   a\r\n\r\npredetermined exchange rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThus, there will be no impact on our reserve position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our close links with our neighbours in the\r\n\r\nEast Asia region, Singapore is affected by the economic well-being  of their economies.  This was clearly demonstrated  by\r\n\r\nthe   recent  financial  crisis.   It  is  therefore  in  our\r\n\r\ninterests  to  do  what  we  can  to  maintain  economic  and\r\n\r\nfinancial   stability  in  the  region.

Subsequently, in February  this  year,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Trade  and  Industry  of  Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nSecretariat  of Commerce and Industrial Development  (SECOFI)\r\n\r\nof Mexico agreed that negotiations would begin in July.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two main purposes to my recent trip to\r\n\r\nMexico.   First,  to open Singapore's first trade  office  in\r\n\r\nLatin  America.  This is in recognition of the  closer  trade\r\n\r\nlinks  between  Mexico and Singapore and  the  potential  for\r\n\r\ngreater  expansion in the future.  Over the last  ten  years,\r\n\r\ntrade  between Singapore and Mexico increased by  an  average\r\n\r\nrate of over 30% a year, reaching $2.2 billion last year.  In\r\n\r\n1998,  Mexico exported more electronics products to Singapore\r\n\r\nthan to the rest of East Asia, including China, Korea, Japan,\r\n\r\nHong Kong and Taiwan combined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second purpose of my trip was to deliver a personal\r\n\r\nletter  of  invitation from Prime Minister Goh  to  President\r\n\r\nZedillo  to visit Singapore in November before he steps  down\r\n\r\nat the end of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also met with my counterpart Minister, Dr Herminio\r\n\r\nBlanco.   Dr  Blanco  and  I agreed that  we  should  try  to\r\n\r\ncomplete our negotiations for an FTA by November, in time for\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  Goh  and President Zedillo  to  witness  its\r\n\r\nsigning when the President is in South East Asia for the APEC\r\n\r\nLeaders'  Meeting.  However, we may not be able  to  complete\r\n\r\nnegotiations  within this short time frame.  If  negotiations\r\n\r\ncannot  be  completed by then, Dr Blanco and I  will  sign  a\r\n\r\ndocument  listing the areas that our negotiators have  agreed\r\n\r\non   and   expressing  our  common  intention   to   complete\r\n\r\nnegotiations  by the middle of next year when a  new  Mexican\r\n\r\nadministration has been in office for a number of months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the candidate of the present ruling party wins, there\r\n\r\nwill of course be continuity.

While there were some concerns  about\r\n\r\nthe  impact  of  the FTA on specific domestic sectors,  these\r\n\r\nconcerns  arose  from  a lack of knowledge  about  Singapore.\r\n\r\nFundamentally,  Singapore  poses no  threat  to  politically-sensitive sectors in Mexico like steel and textiles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will negotiate an Investment Guarantee Agreement as\r\n\r\npart of the FTA to facilitate Singapore investment in Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhile  our  present  investment in  Mexico,  which  currently\r\n\r\namounts  to  US$133  million, is small  in  relation  to  our\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  Asia,  it has grown significantly  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.

Yet,  globalisation  and  fast\r\n\r\nchanging  technology require us to move quickly to  meet  the\r\n\r\nnew  challenges.   Thus, the urgent need to  retain  talented\r\n\r\npeople  in the civil service and the political arena to  take\r\n\r\nour  country into the very competitive world markets.  We are\r\n\r\nin Government to provide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe ambience for the private sector to create wealth and jobs\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans.  We must pay them well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, many in the House were revisiting many old\r\n\r\narguments  on  why politicians must put service before  self,\r\n\r\nand  I  agree.  But the discussion should be centred,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  on  whether the changes made to the  two  benchmark\r\n\r\nformulae  will be able to meet the changing wage  pattern  in\r\n\r\nthe years to come.  We will debate on these equally important\r\n\r\nissues  at  a later date, or we may lose sight of  the  topic\r\n\r\nunder review.  I know it is difficult to de-link, but we must\r\n\r\ntry.   So with this as the background, we have to ask whether\r\n\r\nwe  are  comfortable  with the revision in  the  remuneration\r\n\r\npackage and can we avoid the situation we are facing now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think today's debate is not why top civil servants and\r\n\r\npolitical  appointees should be paid well.   This  issue  was\r\n\r\nargued  in this House during the last debate on the  subject.\r\n\r\nWe  agreed and we discussed how best we could pay them.   And\r\n\r\nit  was in that debate that the current two benchmarks, 15P32\r\n\r\nand  2/3  average  24, were thoroughly discussed  and  agreed\r\n\r\nupon,  some  grudgingly.  I remember SM  said  that  once  we\r\n\r\nagreed  on  the formula, we need not come back to this  House\r\n\r\nagain  to  discuss this politically emotive  issue.   But  we\r\n\r\ncould not achieve this because of two changes taking place in\r\n\r\nthe  world.   One  is  the new economy  companies,  including\r\n\r\ndot.coms  and  life  sciences.  Their  remunerations  do  not\r\n\r\nfollow  the  norm.   Second,  stock  option  is  becoming  an\r\n\r\naccepted  way of rewarding the top executives.  This  portion\r\n\r\nof  reward  far exceeds their basic salary.  How  we  address\r\n\r\nthese two will be a challenge for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15P32 apparently is working well. But I am not so sure\r\n\r\nhow  long  it  needs another review, seeing the  big  numbers\r\n\r\ncoming  from the United States corporate remunerations.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  let me give you some idea.  Last year, US CEOs,  on\r\n\r\naverage,  earned an incredible 475 times more than  what  the\r\n\r\nworkers  did.  If you compare this to 84 times  in  the  year\r\n\r\n1990,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  is  a  very  big jump.  We may not see  such  figures  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  yet.  But we tend to follow the US trend.   Today,\r\n\r\nthe  average  Singapore  CEO earns 44  times  more  than  the\r\n\r\naverage worker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has proposed three changes. The first one is to put\r\n\r\nmore  numbers in the basket of top earners, that is, increase\r\n\r\nto  eight, instead of the present four top earners in the six\r\n\r\ncategories  -  banking, accountancy, law, engineering,  local\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and multinational companies.  The second change\r\n\r\nis  to rank these 48 top earners in these categories and take\r\n\r\nthe  median.  And third, stock options, a portion of the 48th\r\n\r\ntop earners be divided by two, that is, accept only 50%.  The\r\n\r\ntwo  points of increasing the pool of top earners to  48  and\r\n\r\ntaking the median as a reference base definitely improves the\r\n\r\nformula.  But, again as before, it fails to address the point\r\n\r\nthat  these 48 top earners change every year.  This has  been\r\n\r\nbrought up a couple of times by other Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question some are asking is, as long as the pay of\r\n\r\nthe  48  top  earners in the private sector  keeps  changing,\r\n\r\nMinisters'  pay  will always receive an  upward  revision  of\r\n\r\ntheir  pay, as experienced in the recession years.  To  many,\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  win-win situation.  Is there a  reason  for  not\r\n\r\nchanging?   Perhaps, DPM would want to consider keeping  half\r\n\r\nof  the 48, that is, 24 top earners permanent and rotate  the\r\n\r\nrest.   This could be a compromised move to reflect the truer\r\n\r\ncomparison  as the same cohort of 24 is used for every  year.\r\n\r\nThe  ideal  of course is to use the same cohort  of  48  each\r\n\r\nyear.  It is only a suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new economy, the salaries of top CEOs will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  go  up  as  the  salaries  are  based  on   the\r\n\r\nindividual's worth and not on good or bad years.  If we  take\r\n\r\nthe  cue from the US again, in 1994, the US CEOs made  US$2.8\r\n\r\nmillion.   Last  year, the average CEO of large  corporations\r\n\r\nearned  US$12.4  million.  As Singapore is 12  to  18  months\r\n\r\nbehind  the US, we can expect next year's salary of our  CEOs\r\n\r\nto  follow suit and a corresponding increase of our top civil\r\n\r\nservants and political appointees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large portion of pay package could come from stock\r\n\r\noptions.   Thus,  halving  the amount  of  the  stock  option\r\n\r\nportion, as suggested in the new formula, may be very high in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  years.   I therefore suggest  that  we  consider\r\n\r\nputting  a cap on this.  One suggestion is to use the present\r\n\r\nstock  option portion of this revised formula as a  benchmark\r\n\r\nto  work  out a figure on this.  In yesterday's DPM's speech,\r\n\r\nhe said, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Executives may exercise in a single year stock options\r\n\r\nwhich they have accumulated over several years, especially in\r\n\r\na  bull  market.  To accept the full amount of  stock  option\r\n\r\ngains  without  any  discount is unfair  and  will  skew  the\r\n\r\nbenchmark upwards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, my suggestion for a cap is reasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Singaporeans are not aware that the Minister's\r\n\r\nsalary  is a total package.  Many Singaporeans do not realise\r\n\r\nthis.   There  are no perks, like car, driver,  house,  maid,\r\n\r\nmedical benefits, etc, and that the bonuses form part of  the\r\n\r\npay package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have made a few suggestions which I\r\n\r\nhope DPM will consider.  I support this revision in salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport  this statement and wish to compliment  DPM  for  the\r\n\r\ntransparent   manner  in  which  this  issue  was   proposed.\r\n\r\nInevitably, the transparent manner of discussing this  matter\r\n\r\nwill generate discussion and debate.  Even in private sector,\r\n\r\ndiscussions   on  salaries  and  remuneration   are   usually\r\n\r\nsensitive  and  touchy.  In a small country, like  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhere  everybody knows everybody, you cannot avoid this issue\r\n\r\nbeing personalised.  This, I think, will remain for some time\r\n\r\nan unavoidable outcome to this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since this was announced yesterday, I asked a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  people whether it is too much to  pay  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  about  $1.9  million or $34  million  annually  for\r\n\r\nelected  Members of this House.  Most really do not know  how\r\n\r\nmuch is enough.  But they agree that the Prime Minister,  for\r\n\r\nexample, should be paid a very high\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsalary  for  the job he is doing.  In fact, some are  puzzled\r\n\r\nthat,  despite  the  increase, the Prime  Minister  is  still\r\n\r\nranked 63rd among top salary earners.  Many have no qualms to\r\n\r\nhave  our  Prime  Minister being the highest paid  among  top\r\n\r\nprofessionals.   This shows that Singaporeans now  understand\r\n\r\nthat  we need to pay the best to attract the brightest to  do\r\n\r\nwhat is seen as the most important job in this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there are problems, especially with\r\n\r\nbenchmarking  civil service salaries with the private  sector\r\n\r\nand this can be problematic.  It is quite clear that most top\r\n\r\njobs in the private sector carry a high level and element  of\r\n\r\nuncertainty   in  a  hire-and-fire  environment.    For   the\r\n\r\nMinister,  some  said  that  at least  he  gets  a  five-year\r\n\r\ncontract  before his next election, a luxury  private  sector\r\n\r\nexecutives do not enjoy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the salary review has been very comprehensive and,\r\n\r\nin  my  view,  quite  revolutionary,  as  it  has  even  made\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretaries non-permanent, it will be difficult  to\r\n\r\navoid  or  eradicate completely, like DPM said,  the  \"hentak\r\n\r\nkaki\"  mentality,  in  a large organisation  like  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  We need to consider a number of things.   While  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  transparent system of paying top  wages  to  attract\r\n\r\ntalents into the civil service, we seem to have less  than  a\r\n\r\ntransparent  system in dealing with non-performers.   With  a\r\n\r\nlarge  organisation like the civil service, we  can  possibly\r\n\r\nhave  a  free rider situation.  We therefore need to be  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive in the scrutiny and management of those who are\r\n\r\nnot performing well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see this as a problem of political office\r\n\r\nholders as they are more visible but the same cannot be  said\r\n\r\nof  civil servants who are generally and sometimes seen to be\r\n\r\ninsulated from blame and problems.  Second, there is also the\r\n\r\ntime  lag problem which has made it necessary to have  salary\r\n\r\nor  wage increase even at a time when private sector salaries\r\n\r\nare  just coming out of a recession.  Perhaps, one suggestion\r\n\r\nis to appoint a group of search\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfirms  tasked to recommend salaries consistent with  formulas\r\n\r\nthat  have  been established. This is a practice  adopted  by\r\n\r\nmany  in  major MNCs and can similarly be done  to  determine\r\n\r\ncivil service salaries. Such firms can be more responsive and\r\n\r\ntherefore close the time lag problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another benefit to this, that is, you have a\r\n\r\nthird  party  telling you what is the going market  rate  for\r\n\r\nthese professionals which would make it easier to handle this\r\n\r\nissue, because some feel that even if salaries are pegged  at\r\n\r\nmuch higher levels today, the overwhelming majority that  the\r\n\r\nPAP has in this House will make this a foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem you have is that when you provide a\r\n\r\nrange of salaries for certain categories of the same grade in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service,  the number of people  you  can  compare\r\n\r\nwithin  that  same  grade is far too  small  to  provide  any\r\n\r\nmeaningful competition as in the case of private sector where\r\n\r\nthere are a lot more competition and similar types of jobs in\r\n\r\nother  companies.   Therefore, I  think  the  appointment  of\r\n\r\nsearch firms may be relevant in this case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, concerned about one possible unintended\r\n\r\nconsequence of this whole exercise and, that is,  whether  it\r\n\r\nwill  affect  the  moral  authority  of  civil  servants  and\r\n\r\npolitical office bearers to govern because moral authority is\r\n\r\nextremely  important.  I travel in the  region  almost  every\r\n\r\nweek  and have discovered the deep and wide respect that this\r\n\r\nGovernment enjoys, not only in Singapore but also outside the\r\n\r\nregion and, partially, this has got to do with the fact  that\r\n\r\nprevious  office holders have demonstrated a level  of  self-sacrifice  when it comes to their own wages and remuneration.\r\n\r\nI am also aware that we have existing procedures and policies\r\n\r\nof  existing office holders who exercise restraint in  making\r\n\r\ninvestments or getting themselves involved in other kinds  of\r\n\r\njobs.   I think this is something that we need to make  clear\r\n\r\nand  something which we need to guard against  to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  while we pay top wages to our office holders, they  are\r\n\r\nnot seen to also compromise on the other investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in this particular instance, I think political\r\n\r\noffice  bearers  are visible, they can be seen,  people  know\r\n\r\nwhat  they do, where they go, where they live, what car  they\r\n\r\ndrive. But the same cannot be said for civil servants.   That\r\n\r\nis  where  we need to be more careful and have provisions  to\r\n\r\navoid  such  conflicts instituted and not be the  subject  of\r\n\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I would like to again reiterate my\r\n\r\nsupport for the statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It is\r\n\r\noften  said that touching on the subject of money would  hurt\r\n\r\ninter-personal relationship.  Even in a company, some  people\r\n\r\nwould  be unhappy if one of their colleagues gets a pay raise\r\n\r\nof  only  $50  or  $100.  We are now talking  about  the  pay\r\n\r\nincreases of our Ministers.  Thus, we have to take more pains\r\n\r\nin explaining this matter to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many governments do not publicly discuss pay increases\r\n\r\nfor ministers, especially in countries where the ruling party\r\n\r\nis  weak. The ruling party is worried that it might be  voted\r\n\r\nout.  Other  governments  do not  discuss  this  because  the\r\n\r\ncountry  cannot  afford higher pay for  its  ministers.   The\r\n\r\nresult is a less than clean government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is unique. Firstly, we discuss the issue of\r\n\r\nministers'  pay  openly.  The Government  takes  a  long-term\r\n\r\napproach  to this issue because we want to maintain  a  first\r\n\r\nclass government with first class efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our system is highly transparent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people ask why we are so transparent about the high\r\n\r\nsalaries of our Ministers.  There are many other easier  ways\r\n\r\nto  compensate  them  and to supplement their  salaries,  for\r\n\r\nexample, giving them housing allowances, providing them  with\r\n\r\na  chauffeur  or  a maid.  The Government can  also  increase\r\n\r\ntheir  salaries quietly through promotion.  If  we  do  that,\r\n\r\nthings  would have been much easier.  However, it is not  the\r\n\r\nstyle of the Government to do that.  We want to lay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neverything  on  the  table and allow  even  the  formula  for\r\n\r\ncalculating Ministers' salaries to be brought up  for  public\r\n\r\nscrutiny.   This  is a very honest way of  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we discuss this issue, my view is that the emphasis\r\n\r\nshould   be  on  how  to  establish  a  system  to  determine\r\n\r\nministers'  salaries rather than focusing on  the  individual\r\n\r\nminister's  salary.  I think this would make our  discussions\r\n\r\nmore objective and rational.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers and top civil servants are charged with the\r\n\r\nvery heavy responsibility of improving the standard of living\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans.  We have to establish a system so that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  civil  service  can  attract  the  best\r\n\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements of our Government are for all to\r\n\r\nsee.  There is no need for us to blow our own trumpet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I had a conversation with an Ambassador of a\r\n\r\nforeign  country.  She told me that in the past three  years,\r\n\r\nthere  were  two things in Singapore that left  a  very  deep\r\n\r\nimpression  on her.  First, during the financial crisis,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had time and again devised strategies  to  tackle\r\n\r\nthe  recession,  and  eventually led  Singapore  out  of  the\r\n\r\nrecession  -  the  first country in this  region  to  do  so.\r\n\r\nSecondly, while we were dealing with the recession,  we  also\r\n\r\nmade  preparations to face the challenges of the new economy,\r\n\r\nthat is, to plan for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I spoke to a couple of Hong Kong entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nand  they told me the property market in Hong Kong had fallen\r\n\r\ndrastically.  This had caused a lot of unhappiness among  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  many  of  them  had  taken  to  the  streets  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate   against  the  government.   These   Hong   Kong\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs asked me how Singapore managed to prevent  such\r\n\r\na  predicament.  I told them that in Singapore, the political\r\n\r\nleadership  had anticipated the problem of `over-heating'  of\r\n\r\nthe  property market and introduced some timely  measures  to\r\n\r\ncool down the situation in the property market.  This is  the\r\n\r\ndifference between Singapore and Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, PERC, an independent think tank\r\n\r\nbased in Hong Kong, in its report in May, rated the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment as number one in terms of political leadership and\r\n\r\neconomic policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not look at the revision of Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries  in  an  isolated manner.   We  have  to  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  various factors in  the  public  and  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sectors.   We are now in the midst  of  transforming\r\n\r\ninto  a new economy.  There are many attractions for talented\r\n\r\nyoung  people to go into the private sector.  This bodes  ill\r\n\r\nfor  the public sector in the long term.  On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nif the salaries in the public sector are much more attractive\r\n\r\nthan in the private sector, it is also not an ideal situation\r\n\r\nbecause  the  private sector might be weakened as  a  result.\r\n\r\nBetween  these two sectors, we have to maintain a balance  so\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be a free flow of talents. They  should  be\r\n\r\nable to move from the public sector to the private sector and\r\n\r\nvice  versa.   We  want to have first-class  talents  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector so as to help formulate and implement policies\r\n\r\nas  these policies will affect the private sector and all the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the relationship between the political leaders\r\n\r\nand the civil servants, let me share this story with members.\r\n\r\nRecently, I attended an international conference where I  met\r\n\r\na  delegate  from an economy whose government was just  newly\r\n\r\nelected.   I  asked him about his government's  new  economic\r\n\r\npolicies.   He told me that the new government had  only  two\r\n\r\npriorities - one was environmental protection and  the  other\r\n\r\nwas  to  please the workers.  As for how to promote  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, the new government had no ideas at all.  He said\r\n\r\nthat  civil  servants were facing big problems.   This  shows\r\n\r\nthat  if the political leaders are weak, the government  will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to function satisfactorily even if you have good\r\n\r\ncivil  servants.  The ideal situation is where the  political\r\n\r\nleaders are more far-sighted and more capable than the  civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to talk about the relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the  political leadership and  the  private  sector.\r\n\r\nYesterday,  some  MPs opined that the risks  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector are higher.  Of course, there are risks in the private\r\n\r\nsector.   Ministers  also face high risks,  though  different\r\n\r\ntypes of risks.  As for the responsibility that they hold,  I\r\n\r\nthink  no  one will have any doubt that theirs are very  much\r\n\r\nheavier.  They have to care for 3 million Singaporeans, their\r\n\r\nemployment, their education and their future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of peace and prosperity, we will not appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  important  roles  played by the Ministers.   Only  in  a\r\n\r\ncrisis  will  we  realise the importance  of  having  a  good\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political leadership, the civil service and the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  should maintain a balanced  relationship  so\r\n\r\nthat  there  can  be mobility among talents  in  these  three\r\n\r\nsectors.  We have a very limited pool of talents.  If we  can\r\n\r\nwork  out a salary formula, which can facilitate the flow  of\r\n\r\ntalents  among  these  three  sectors,  it  will  be  to  the\r\n\r\nadvantage of our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing formula will be replaced by a new formula.\r\n\r\nThe  new  formula is to take the 48 top earners  in  the  six\r\n\r\nselected  professions  and to use the  median  point  of  the\r\n\r\nincome  as  a  benchmark.  The ministers'  salaries  will  be\r\n\r\npegged  at  two-thirds  of the benchmark.   Compared  to  the\r\n\r\nexisting  formula, this is an improvement.  This  shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is prepared to review the agreed  formula  to\r\n\r\nsuit  new  circumstances.  There is one common characteristic\r\n\r\nin  these two formulae - the discounting factor.  Now, we are\r\n\r\nusing  two-thirds.  Should it be lower or higher?  A decision\r\n\r\nhas  to be made.  Deputy Prime Minister has surfaced this new\r\n\r\nformula for us to discuss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that there should be flexibility in the formula,\r\n\r\nso that even in changed circumstances, it can be adjusted and\r\n\r\nbe accepted by most people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is not the best time to raise the issue\r\n\r\nof pay increases for Ministers and civil servants.  This is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause the cut in employers' CPF contributions has not  been\r\n\r\nfully  restored yet and there have been increases in  utility\r\n\r\ncharges, taxi fares, etc of late.  So a lot of effort has  to\r\n\r\nbe made to convince the people to accept this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this connection, I hope that the Government will\r\n\r\npay  special attention to the following matters.  Firstly  is\r\n\r\nwage cost.  Will the pay increases result in a chain reaction\r\n\r\nthat  triggers  off  an  escalation in the  private  sector's\r\n\r\nsalaries?    If   wage   cost   is   increased,   will    our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness be eroded?  Secondly, will this result  in  a\r\n\r\nchain  of price increases and push up inflation?  Thirdly,  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  Government  will  continue  with  the  asset\r\n\r\nenhancement programmes so that all Singaporeans will be  able\r\n\r\nto enjoy the fruits of our economic success.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  principle  of  pegging Ministers'  and  top  civil\r\n\r\nservants' pay to that of the top earners  in the private sector was \r\n\r\ndebated in this  House  in 1994.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My stand on the matter remains unchanged. I do not\r\n\r\nagree  with the principle in the White Paper.  In my opinion,\r\n\r\nthose who decide to take up politics and those who decide  to\r\n\r\nearn  more  money for themselves are two distinctly different\r\n\r\ncategories  of  people.   If you  want  to  peg  the  pay  of\r\n\r\npolitical  appointees  like Ministers,  Ministers  of  State,\r\n\r\netc., to the top earners in the private sector, and say  that\r\n\r\nwithout  doing so,  you would not be able to attract suitable\r\n\r\ntalents into politics is virtually degrading the politicians'\r\n\r\nnoble spirit of serving the nation and serving the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that times have changed. We should be more\r\n\r\nrealistic  and look at this issue from the point of  view  of\r\n\r\nmarket  economy.   But we all know that governing  a  country\r\n\r\nwith the national resources as its backing and doing business\r\n\r\nwith   one's   private  capital  are  two  different   things\r\n\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector faces market competition, even\r\n\r\ncompetition  in  the  international market.   Among  the  top\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearners in the private sector, some are owners of enterprises\r\n\r\nand some are salaried employees.  But do not forget that even\r\n\r\nworld-class  banks  can collapse and  close  down!   The  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment does not own Singapore, neither are the Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaried employees.  They rule the country on a mandate given\r\n\r\nto  them by the people after a general election.   Once  they\r\n\r\nare  in  power, they can put to use the assets of the  State.\r\n\r\nThey  enjoy great power to decide everything.  They can  also\r\n\r\nformulate and implement all sorts of policies to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthey can be returned safely at the next general election.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore,  competition  in  the  election  market  is   very\r\n\r\nlimited.  As such, although both can be described as markets,\r\n\r\nthere is a vast difference between them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the electors in Singapore have elected the PAP to\r\n\r\nform  the  Government to rule the country, the PAP Government\r\n\r\ncan  decide how much their Ministers are worth.  Is it asking\r\n\r\nfor the sky?  It is left to the people to judge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the Government does not have to go through all\r\n\r\nthe  trouble, using  all kinds of computation methods  to peg\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers' salaries  to the top earners in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  just  to  justify the amounts they are  asking  for.\r\n\r\nThere  is no need to use the income of the top 24 or  top  48\r\n\r\nearners  in  the  country  as a benchmark  to  calculate  the\r\n\r\nMinisters' salaries.   They might as well put it in a  simple\r\n\r\nand  straightforward manner and say the Ministers need to  be\r\n\r\npaid  how  many  hundreds of thousands of  dollars  a  month,\r\n\r\notherwise the Ministers would not have enough money to use!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the civil servants' salaries, I believe\r\n\r\nthere  is  just a very small number of senior civil  servants\r\n\r\nwho  are  going  to  receive substantial  pay  rise  in  this\r\n\r\nexercise.  Thanks to the Ministers, they are given these  pay\r\n\r\nincreases  to  avoid having a big gap between their  salaries\r\n\r\nand  those of the Ministers, lest it may be difficult for the\r\n\r\nCabinet to account for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government says that it is transparent and the\r\n\r\nMinisters'  salary  system  is  also  transparent.   But  the\r\n\r\ninformation   provided  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister   in\r\n\r\nParliament yesterday was not transparent enough.  May  I  ask\r\n\r\nwhether the Ministers' salaries as reflected in Handout 2 are\r\n\r\nonly  the basic salaries under the Ministers' salary  system?\r\n\r\nI would like to request the Deputy Prime Minister to disclose\r\n\r\nthe  full  information on the gross salaries of the political\r\n\r\noffice-holders and the civil servants of the various  grades,\r\n\r\nincluding the various variable components, bonuses and  other\r\n\r\nallowances payable to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must not forget that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  paying a high price to engage this  batch  of\r\n\r\ntalents  to  become Ministers.  We sincerely  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nreturn received by the people will not be mere peanuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I am much obliged\r\n\r\nto you for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we debated on the disparity of incomes of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  The lowest 10% of our workers were reported to\r\n\r\nbe  earning as low as $133 a month.   The Minister said  that\r\n\r\nthe Straits Times had made a mistake in its report.  Assuming\r\n\r\nthat there were mistakes in that report and we correct it  by\r\n\r\ndoubling  the  reported wage of $133 to $266  a  month,  then\r\n\r\nrounding it off to $300 a month.  Even at $300 a month,  that\r\n\r\nis  a  very low income.  A man can barely survive on  $300  a\r\n\r\nmonth these days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am certain that Ministers must be aware that\r\n\r\nthere are Singaporeans who are barely scraping the bottom  of\r\n\r\nthe  barrel  to  make  a living.  Does  it  not  prick  their\r\n\r\nconscience then when they themselves ask for high salaries at\r\n\r\nover  a  million  dollars a year?    If we take  the  average\r\n\r\nworker's wages at $2,000 a month or $24,000 a year,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  salary at $1.4 million a year, then the  Minister\r\n\r\nis  earning  something  like 60 times more  than  an  average\r\n\r\nworker  in Singapore.  It means that  for a Minister to  work\r\n\r\nfor one year, the average worker in Singapore has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  slog for his lifetime for 60 years.  This, to me, somehow\r\n\r\ndoes not look right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers are supposed to be servants of the people.\r\n\r\nThey  are  to  take  care of the people and  to  give  public\r\n\r\nservice to lead the people, particularly by example.  How can\r\n\r\nour  Ministers have the moral authority when they take  their\r\n\r\nposts  purely  on  the  profit motive  by  asking  such  high\r\n\r\nsalaries?  At the moment, our Ministers are paid the  highest\r\n\r\nsalaries  in the world, more than Presidents, Prime Ministers\r\n\r\nand  Ministers  of  other bigger and  richer  countries  than\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, President Clinton is paid about S$630,000 a\r\n\r\nyear, half of what our Ministers get and one-third of that of\r\n\r\nour  Prime Minister.  I believe the work of the President  of\r\n\r\nthe  United  States  is definitely more  difficult  and  more\r\n\r\nonerous  than that of any of the Ministers and Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Yet, they can live quite comfortably on a much\r\n\r\nlower  salary than our Ministers and Prime Minister.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot that America is poorer than Singapore.  It is not that it\r\n\r\nis  unable to pay its President well.  If they wanted to, the\r\n\r\nAmericans  can  afford to pay their President three  or  even\r\n\r\nfour  times more than the Prime Minister in Singapore.   They\r\n\r\ncertainly  can  afford  to do so, since  it  is  the  richest\r\n\r\ncountry  in  the  world.   In fact, a  few  of  the  American\r\n\r\ncompanies earn more money a year than the whole of Singapore.\r\n\r\nYet,  the Americans choose not to pay the President and their\r\n\r\nMinisters high salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: why do Americans choose not to pay\r\n\r\ntheir President and the Ministers high salaries, as Singapore\r\n\r\nis  doing?  The reason is that the Americans feel that  those\r\n\r\nwho  aspire to take up public office must have an element  of\r\n\r\nsacrifice.   It  must be seen that those who take  up  public\r\n\r\noffice  are  there to serve the public, and  not  to  make  a\r\n\r\nprofit  out of that office.  The President and his  Ministers\r\n\r\nwill  then  have  the  moral authority  to  lead.   They  are\r\n\r\nbasically there to serve the people and not to make money out\r\n\r\nof their office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Americans are right on that point. We must\r\n\r\nnot scoff at American\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvalues.   That country has not only survived over 200  years,\r\n\r\nover two world wars, but has become the most powerful and the\r\n\r\nrichest nation in the world.  There must be something that we\r\n\r\ncan learn from the Americans in regard to the way they reward\r\n\r\ntheir  President and their Ministers.  I hope  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nits Ministers shall take note of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not envious of the high salaries paid to the\r\n\r\nMinisters.   My concern is more for the future of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of values should we set for young Singaporeans?  On\r\n\r\nthe one hand, leaders of Singapore urge the people to be more\r\n\r\ncommunitarian  and not to be so self-centred, individualistic\r\n\r\nand care only for oneself.  But, on the other hand, where the\r\n\r\nMinisters' salaries are concerned, they do not believe in the\r\n\r\ncommunitarian way.  The Ministers want their salaries  to  be\r\n\r\npegged  to  the private sector's high earners.   The  private\r\n\r\nsector's  motivation is on profit.  Private  sector  earnings\r\n\r\nand  level  of  salaries are entirely  based  on  profit  and\r\n\r\nearnings.  Whereas on the part of Ministers, their motivation\r\n\r\nis  not  profit  orientated  but  on  nation  building.   The\r\n\r\nMinisters  then  should not be asking for salaries  based  on\r\n\r\nhigh  earners in the private sector, but should be  based  on\r\n\r\nother principles.  I think the fairest way is to ask how much\r\n\r\na Minister needs to have a comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on the White Paper on Ministers' salaries in\r\n\r\n1994, I told the House that I estimated that about $50,000  a\r\n\r\nmonth  should  give  a Minister a comfortable  living   -   a\r\n\r\nbungalow house, servants, two motorcars and with a chauffeur,\r\n\r\nannual  holidays and children's education.  I note  that  NMP\r\n\r\nWalter Woon in the same debate also proposed a similar figure\r\n\r\nof  about  $50,000 a month or $600,000 a year.  He said  that\r\n\r\ncould be a base on which the Ministers could work.  I tend to\r\n\r\nagree with Dr Woon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that as long as the Ministers are given a\r\n\r\ndignified  comfortable  standard of  living  that  should  be\r\n\r\nenough.   That should be the criterion.  We cannot factor  in\r\n\r\nthe  profit element.  The profit element is a private  sector\r\n\r\npractice and should not be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfollowed  because  the Ministers are not  running  a  private\r\n\r\ncompany.  They are running a country, a nation, hopefully, in\r\n\r\nour  case.   They are leaders of the people and  they  should\r\n\r\nlead  by  example.  If our leaders show our people that  they\r\n\r\nare  there in public positions and claim for themselves  huge\r\n\r\nprofits,  the wrong signals shall definitely be sent  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  including our young Singaporeans.  They  shall\r\n\r\nbecome  cynical  and  the only thing that  concerns  them  is\r\n\r\nmoney.  In fact, if money is the only motivation why one does\r\n\r\na certain job, that person shall not do that job well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the great achievers in the world. When asked\r\n\r\nwhy  they  take on that job or do that thing which  they  are\r\n\r\ngood  at, the answers are inevitably not the great amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  they can earn, but the love of their job or the things\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing.  For example, when Michael Chang and  Boris\r\n\r\nBecker,  world famous tennis players from America and Germany\r\n\r\nrespectively,  were  asked why they  devote  their  lives  to\r\n\r\nplaying tennis, they said that they love the game and not the\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars they can earn or have earned.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nif  Ministers  really love their job and want  to  serve  the\r\n\r\npeople well, they should not be asking for high salaries.  By\r\n\r\nasking  for  high salaries, they are giving wrong signals  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that they do not love their job but for the huge\r\n\r\nprofits that they can earn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speakers in this debate and the debate on the White\r\n\r\nPaper in 1994 had commented on the unfairness of pegging  the\r\n\r\nMinisters' salaries to the six highest earners in a  selected\r\n\r\ngroup  of  professions  in the private  sector.   The  reason\r\n\r\nmainly  is  that  the private sector of  the  same  group  of\r\n\r\npersons may not be drawing the same salaries in the following\r\n\r\nyear and also that they are taking bigger risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more equitable method is to peg our Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries  to  the world leaders of other countries.   A  good\r\n\r\nexample  is to take the President of the United States  as  a\r\n\r\nbase  for  which  we can work on.  I do not  think  that  our\r\n\r\nMinisters  will  complain  on that.  We  should  compare  the\r\n\r\nsalaries paid to those in the public service in Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  those  in the public service of other renowned  countries\r\n\r\nand  not compare the public sector salary with those  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.   The public sector and the  private  sector\r\n\r\ncannot   be  compared  because  the  two  are  motivated   by\r\n\r\ncompletely different reasons.  One is for public good and the\r\n\r\nother  is  purely for profit.  The two cannot be  reconciled.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  public  sector salaries cannot  use  the  private\r\n\r\nsector salaries as a benchmark.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had read a report in the Hansard where Members of\r\n\r\nParliament  in  England  were debating  on  the  increase  of\r\n\r\nMembers'  allowances.  Almost each of the Members  there  who\r\n\r\nrose  to  speak began by saying how embarrassed they were  on\r\n\r\nspeaking of the increase of their own remuneration.   It  can\r\n\r\nbe  seen from that debate in England that the values  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish   parliamentarians  are  different  from   those   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Over in England, the parliamentarians there  were\r\n\r\nterribly  embarrassed when they were speaking on the increase\r\n\r\nof  their own pay.  One notes that it is not so in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministers  in  Singapore have affirmed confidently  that\r\n\r\nthey  have a right to be paid the proposed high salaries  and\r\n\r\nare  not  a bit embarrassed by it.  This is an observation  I\r\n\r\nnote  in  the difference of attitudes and values between  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Parliament and the English Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would just like to state what I heard\r\n\r\nlast  night  at  my meet-the-people session.  One  grassroots\r\n\r\nmember,  on hearing the revision of the Ministers'  salaries,\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Wow, can buy a house every year.\"  Another  remarked,\r\n\r\n\"Just like striking a lottery each year.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is not the United States.

So running Singapore, I believe, is much more hazardous\r\n\r\nand  difficult than running the United States.

If\r\n\r\nthe Government does not run Singapore well, the whole country\r\n\r\ncan disappear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1966, the Government sent me to study Development\r\n\r\nEconomics  in Williams College in the US.  It was  a  special\r\n\r\ncourse for officials from developing countries.  I was then a\r\n\r\nyoung officer working in the Economic Planning Unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My class of 20 came from 16 different countries in Asia,\r\n\r\nAfrica,  Latin  America and southern Europe. We  were  taught\r\n\r\ntheories  of  economic development, quantitative  programming\r\n\r\nand  other useful subjects.  But what we were not taught  was\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  good government as a  pre-condition  for\r\n\r\nsustained economic development.  This was assumed.  But alas,\r\n\r\nit  was an assumption that did not hold true for most of  the\r\n\r\ncountries  represented in my class.   What  has  happened  to\r\n\r\nthese  countries  since  then is instructive.   For  example,\r\n\r\nthree  of  the countries have broken up - Pakistan,  Ethiopia\r\n\r\nand  Yugoslavia.  Nine countries have experienced civil wars,\r\n\r\nsocial  upheavals  or violent changes of government  at  some\r\n\r\nstage  in  the  last  35 years - Philippines,  India,  Egypt,\r\n\r\nUganda,  Liberia,  Mexico, Colombia,  Bolivia  and  Honduras.\r\n\r\nThat leaves only four countries out of the 16 represented  in\r\n\r\nmy  class  without  severe political and social  upheavals  - Kenya,  Tanzania, Malaysia and Singapore.  Kenya and Tanzania\r\n\r\nare not exactly models of economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to do a Ph.D, I would study the relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  economic development and the quality of  government.\r\n\r\nEmpirically, there is clearly a close correlation between the\r\n\r\neconomic  performance of a country and  the  quality  of  its\r\n\r\ngovernment.   The more competent the government,  the  higher\r\n\r\nthe  economic growth of the country when measured over a long\r\n\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, other reasons why some countries\r\n\r\ndo  better than others, why their economies grow faster,  why\r\n\r\ntheir people enjoy a higher standard of living, and why  they\r\n\r\nhave peace and stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese  include  a country's natural resources, its  location,\r\n\r\nand  its  people.  All these are important factors no  doubt,\r\n\r\nbut  I  believe  my Ph.D thesis will conclude that  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant factor behind a country's economic performance  and\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of living it can provide its  people,  is  the\r\n\r\nquality of the political leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much wisdom in an old saying that an army of\r\n\r\nsheep led by a lion is stronger than an army of lions led  by\r\n\r\na sheep.  The former will function as an effective unit.  The\r\n\r\nlatter will end up with the lions fighting amongst themselves\r\n\r\nand  the  sheep being eaten.  People are no different.   They\r\n\r\nhave  to  be led.  A people led by a superior government  can\r\n\r\nproduce  exceptional  results.  On the other  hand,  an  able\r\n\r\npeople  led  by  a  mediocre  government  will  underperform.\r\n\r\nWorse, if they are led by a fanatical government which  fears\r\n\r\nbeing challenged, clever people might even lose their heads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cambodia is a tragic example. Pol Pot and his Khmer\r\n\r\nRouge killed off millions of their own people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uganda is another example. Under Idi Amin, it lost many\r\n\r\nof  its  talents.  My friend from Williams College, a  native\r\n\r\nUgandan, had to flee the country.  Ugandans of Indian  origin\r\n\r\nwho  ran the economy were chased out.  Today, 21 years  after\r\n\r\nthe  end of Idi Amin's reign, Uganda is still suffering  from\r\n\r\nhis misrule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;India has millions of talented people. Silicon Valley\r\n\r\nis  full  of  Indians.  Indian Singaporeans have  contributed\r\n\r\nsignificantly to our development.  Yet India remains  a  poor\r\n\r\ncountry.   It  is  weighed down by a bureaucratic  leadership\r\n\r\nthat prevents India from performing to its full potential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that India is capable of achieving much more.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in India in January this year, I put this question\r\n\r\nto several Indian leaders when we discussed the importance of\r\n\r\ntalents.  To what extent of its potential is India performing\r\n\r\ntoday?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their estimate was 30 to 40 percent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Good Government</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people will have different definitions of a\r\n\r\ngood government.  My own criteria for a good government are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It must be honest, fair and just.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It must be capable of forging national consensus and\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion, and willing to take painful  decisions  for\r\n\r\nthe overall good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) It must be able to anticipate the future to head off\r\n\r\nproblems   and   be   nimble  enough  to  adapt   and   seize\r\n\r\nopportunities when circumstances change.  In times of crises,\r\n\r\nit must be resourceful enough to overcome them.  And,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) It must be able to improve the standard of living of\r\n\r\nits  people,  maximize their potential and  involve  them  in\r\n\r\nbuilding a better society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have led this Government for 10 years now. How it has\r\n\r\nperformed is for you to judge, by my criteria or by  whatever\r\n\r\ncriteria   you   choose.   In  particular,   scrutinize   our\r\n\r\nperformance in the last five years from the time we argued in\r\n\r\nthis  House  that Ministers and civil servants must  be  paid\r\n\r\nmarket-based  wages.  Has the performance  of  my  Government\r\n\r\njustified its wage?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare the salaries of Ministers and senior civil\r\n\r\nservants  with  the benefits you receive from having  a  good\r\n\r\ngovernment.   Look at it from the viewpoint of results,  that\r\n\r\nis, the value of output and not the cost of inputs alone.  It\r\n\r\nis  the results which are important.  What you get out of it,\r\n\r\nnot  the  cost of inputs alone.  Has my Government given  you\r\n\r\n\"safe  homes,  stable  jobs and fuel  to  dream  of  all  the\r\n\r\ntomorrows?\", as a member of the public put it.  She wrote  to\r\n\r\nexpress  her  appreciation for my \"keeping the  country  well\r\n\r\noiled  and  well run\". \"Safe homes, stable jobs and  fuel  to\r\n\r\ndream of all the tomorrows?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might not have systematically evaluated the\r\n\r\nperformance   of   the   Singapore   Government,   but   many\r\n\r\ninternational consultancies have.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer to some of these professional\r\n\r\nthird-party  evaluations, not to blow our  trumpets,  but  to\r\n\r\nunderline the value of a good government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singapore's economic competitiveness. This year,\r\n\r\nfor the seventh year running, the International Institute for\r\n\r\nManagement  Development in its annual  World  Competitiveness\r\n\r\nYearbook ranked Singapore the world's second most competitive\r\n\r\neconomy after the US.  Another think-tank, the World Economic\r\n\r\nForum,  thinks  we  have done better.   In  its  1999  Global\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness Report, it ranked Singapore  as  the  world's\r\n\r\nmost competitive economy for the fourth year in a row.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both analyses regard the effectiveness of government\r\n\r\npolicies  as  a  key  factor  contributing  to  the   overall\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  of a country.  In the World  Competitiveness\r\n\r\nYearbook,  Singapore came out first on the  extent  to  which\r\n\r\ngovernment policies are conducive to competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Global Competitiveness Yearbook, Singapore was\r\n\r\nalso  ranked  first  in  many areas of government,  including\r\n\r\neconomic policies and public sector competence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times and Zaobao recently carried a survey\r\n\r\nby  the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) on the\r\n\r\nquality  of  various Asian governments.  The report  by  PERC\r\n\r\nshowed  Singapore  to  have  the best  quality  of  political\r\n\r\nleadership  among  the major economies of Asia.   Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic  policies were also deemed to be the most effective.\r\n\r\nThe  PERC report said, \"A nation's per capita GDP is  a  good\r\n\r\nexample  of  the  effectiveness of a particular  government's\r\n\r\neconomic policies.\"  It goes on to say that if it were to  go\r\n\r\nback fifty years and pick those countries of Asia which would\r\n\r\nbe  dominant  economies  today,  Singapore  would  have  been\r\n\r\nconsidered an economic backwater compared to places  such  as\r\n\r\nManila.   But  Marcos rode the Philippine  economy  into  the\r\n\r\nground,  whereas  Senior  Minister guided  Singapore  to  our\r\n\r\nachievements today in an \"amazingly short period of time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another PERC-produced report in March, Asian\r\n\r\nIntelligence,   also  reported  that  its   respondents   had\r\n\r\n\"consistently  rated  Singapore as having  one  of  the  best\r\n\r\nbureaucracies  in the region\" and that \"Singapore  is  widely\r\n\r\nregarded  as  a  place where things get done,  and  get  done\r\n\r\nefficiently.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not only in the area of economic policy that\r\n\r\ninternational  analysts have rated the  Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nhighly.   In \"The Economic Freedom of the World: 2000  Annual\r\n\r\nReport\", published by the CATO Institute in Washington DC and\r\n\r\nCanada's  Fraser Institute, Singapore scored full  marks  for\r\n\r\nits   legal   structure  and  property  rights.   In   PERC's\r\n\r\nComparative  Country  Risk Report 2000, Singapore's  judicial\r\n\r\nsystem  maintained its top position in Asia.  PERC commented,\r\n\r\n\"Singapore's  legal system has an excellent reputation  among\r\n\r\nbusinessmen for being fair and effective, if a bit  harsh  at\r\n\r\ntimes.\"   More  recently, Lord Woolf, one of  Britain's  most\r\n\r\nsenior judges, was so impressed by the smooth functioning  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  judiciary that he wished the  courts  in  his\r\n\r\ncountry would follow some of the processes here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of health, the World Health Organisation\r\n\r\nearlier  this  month assessed Singapore to have  the  world's\r\n\r\nsixth  best  performing health care system among  191  member\r\n\r\nstates surveyed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system has also come in for praise from\r\n\r\nforeign experts.  US Education Secretary Richard Riley,  when\r\n\r\nhe   was   in  Singapore  recently  for  the  APEC  Education\r\n\r\nMinisterial Meeting, commented that there was a  lot  the  US\r\n\r\ncould  learn from Singapore's education system.  In the third\r\n\r\nand  latest International Mathematics and Science Study  some\r\n\r\nyears  ago, Singapore's 13-year olds came in first  among  41\r\n\r\ncountries in their ability in science and mathematics.   This\r\n\r\nis  clear  testimony of the effectiveness  of  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem.   Some  US  schools are even  using  our  mathematics\r\n\r\ntextbooks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are but a sampling of the international\r\n\r\nassessments of the performance of Singapore and the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans by now take all these assessments and high\r\n\r\nrankings  for  granted.   But pause  for  a  moment  and  ask\r\n\r\nyourself how we have managed to achieve first world standards\r\n\r\nin  so  short a time and with so little resources.  Could  it\r\n\r\nhave  been  done  without leaders of integrity,  ability  and\r\n\r\ndedication to the people they serve?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Test of Government</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true strength of a government is revealed when it is\r\n\r\nput through the most severe crisis.  This Government has been\r\n\r\nput  through  one in the recent Asian financial crisis.   The\r\n\r\nfinancial  storm  devastated the economies  of  South  Korea,\r\n\r\nThailand,   Indonesia  and  Malaysia,  but   left   Singapore\r\n\r\nrelatively unscathed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just consider the damage to these economies in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Korea's economy shrank by 6.7%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thailand's economy shrank by 10.2%, Malaysia's by 7.4%,\r\n\r\nand Indonesia's by a massive 13%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Singapore avoided a contraction in 1998.\r\n\r\nOur economy still grew, if only by 0.4%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose we had not managed our economy well. It could\r\n\r\neasily  have  shrunk by 5%.  This would have taken  off  $9.5\r\n\r\nbillion (at current prices) from our GDP.  Divide this  by  a\r\n\r\npopulation of 3 million and you will get a loss of $3,166 per\r\n\r\nperson.   This is an indication of the price each Singaporean\r\n\r\npays if we had not managed our economy well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, what was the total annual salary for all\r\n\r\npolitical office-holders in 1998?  About $28 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the total salary increase we are proposing for\r\n\r\npolitical office-holders?  About $6 million.  With the salary\r\n\r\nrevision,  the  annual  salaries  of  all  political  office-holders,  that is my Government, will rise from  $28  million\r\n\r\ncurrently  to  $34  million.  Is this a  lot  of  money  when\r\n\r\ncompared  with  the $9.5 billion damage to the  economy  that\r\n\r\ncould have been inflicted by the Asian\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis?  Is $34 million a lot of money  when  they\r\n\r\namount  to only 0.024% of our GDP of $144 billion (at current\r\n\r\nprices)?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put it simply: the damage we had prevented to\r\n\r\nthe  economy  from the Asian financial crisis  is  more  than\r\n\r\nenough  to pay the Ministers and the other political  office-holders  for  the rest of their political lives and  in  fact\r\n\r\nover many lifetimes!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian financial crisis has distinguished us from the\r\n\r\nother regional economies.  Recently, an American asked the US\r\n\r\nAmbassador  to  Singapore, Mr Steven Green, on the  Internet:\r\n\r\n\"Why  was Singapore affected less than the region during  the\r\n\r\neconomic crisis?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His reply: \"In one word, it is management.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are very fortunate to have a government that  is\r\n\r\nvery  well-managed, very far-sighted and willing  to  embrace\r\n\r\nchange.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign governments and investors have noted our\r\n\r\nstrengths in the crisis.  Our ability to withstand the crisis\r\n\r\nhas  increased confidence in Singapore.  This is obvious from\r\n\r\nmy  many meetings with foreign investors and leaders both  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  abroad.  We are going  to  see  more  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments come in.  This means more jobs and better jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put the salaries of Ministers in their proper\r\n\r\nperspective.  A million dollars for a Minister  seems  a  lot\r\n\r\nwhen compared to the salary of a worker.  But $34 million for\r\n\r\nall  the Ministers and political office-holders, that is  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  government,  is a tiny drop when  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  GDP  that a good government can  produce.   For\r\n\r\nevery 1% growth, the GDP increases by $1.4 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Good People for Good Government</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we produce a good government? Get the best to\r\n\r\nserve the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good government does not come naturally. It must be\r\n\r\nsystematically created through the active recruitment of good\r\n\r\nand able people.  You cannot just\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nleave  it  to  the  electoral process  to  throw  up  a  good\r\n\r\ngovernment.   If  the present ruling party  is  not  able  to\r\n\r\npersuade some of the best people to enter politics, you  will\r\n\r\nhave  only  weak  men  and women to choose  from  to  form  a\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every election, we immediately look for new\r\n\r\ncandidates  for the next election (we do not wait  until  the\r\n\r\nelection  is  about to come) - from the civil  service,  SAF,\r\n\r\nPolice,  statutory  boards, GLCs,  the  professions  and  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  In other words, all over Singapore.   Since\r\n\r\nthe  last GE, we have already invited nearly 250 Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  their late 20s to mid-40s for tea sessions.  By the  time\r\n\r\nof  the  next  GE,  we would have met 400  to  500  potential\r\n\r\ncandidates.  Out of them, we hope to find 15 to 20 with these\r\n\r\n5  \"Cs\"  qualities.  These are the 5 \"Cs\" which  a  potential\r\n\r\ncandidate must have (not your usual 5 \"Cs\" but my 5 \"Cs\"):\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Capability: Does he have a record of good\r\n\r\nperformance?  Does he have the potential to become an office-holder?    Does  he  have  good  judgment?    Does  he   have\r\n\r\nleadership qualities?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Character: Does he have character flaws? Is he\r\n\r\nable to get on with people and motivate them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Compassion: Has he done things for others beyond\r\n\r\nhis own family?  Does he care for others?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Conviction: What does he believe in? What does he\r\n\r\nwant  to  achieve in life?  What motivates him?  Why does  he\r\n\r\nwant to be an MP or a Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Commitment: Is he loyal to his friends? Will he\r\n\r\nstay the course?  Will he fight when the chips are down?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we assess that a person is interested only in\r\n\r\npolitics  as  a  career move, he will  not  be  chosen  as  a\r\n\r\ncandidate.  If he is attracted only by the pay, he  will  not\r\n\r\nbe  selected as a Minister.  But that does not mean we should\r\n\r\nnot  pay  a Minister what he is worth.  We are targeting  the\r\n\r\ntop\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople to be Ministers.  They are high-income earners or will\r\n\r\nbe  in their non-political careers.  We will have to pay them\r\n\r\na competitive, market-based salary so that pay will not be an\r\n\r\nobstacle discouraging them from entering politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Joseph Nye, Dean of the Kennedy School of\r\n\r\nGovernment  at Harvard University, made the same point  in  a\r\n\r\ntalk in Singapore last year.  He said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore is very wise. You need to attract good\r\n\r\npeople into government, and paying high salaries reduces  the\r\n\r\nincentive for corruption.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point on corruption, Singapore's policy of paying\r\n\r\nour  public officials market-based wages has helped us create\r\n\r\na  corruption-free environment.  Transparency  International,\r\n\r\nan  NGO  dedicated  to  fighting  corruption  worldwide,  has\r\n\r\nconsistently  ranked  Singapore  within  the  top  ten  least\r\n\r\ncorrupt  countries in the world, since its  index  was  first\r\n\r\npublished  in 1995.  Among Asian countries, we are rated  the\r\n\r\nleast corrupt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Nye added that the high salaries also helped\r\n\r\n\"lateral  entries\" from the private sector  into  government.\r\n\r\nHe  said that this was important in a modern economy  with  a\r\n\r\ncomplex, fast-paced financial sector, as government decision-makers would need the inputs of private sector practitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Nye was right about lateral transfers. When\r\n\r\nwe  identify  a  suitable  young  man  (or  woman)  with  the\r\n\r\npotential to be a Minister, we have to persuade him  to  give\r\n\r\nup  his  bright  prospects  in  the  private  sector  for  an\r\n\r\nuncertain   future  in  politics.   Benchmarking   Ministers'\r\n\r\nsalaries to what the best in the private sector earns,  makes\r\n\r\nit  easier  for us to get some of the best people  to  become\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue that you do not have to pay so much to\r\n\r\nget people to join the public sector or become Ministers, and\r\n\r\nthat there will always be people who want to become Ministers\r\n\r\nor  civil  servants.  Quite right, if you think in  terms  of\r\n\r\nquantity, not quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economist in an article in its issue of 8th May 1999\r\n\r\non  \"The  Politics  of  Envy\"  asked:   \"Why  do  governments\r\n\r\nsystematically underpay their top people?\"  And answered that\r\n\r\nit  is  the  tendency  to  think in terms  of  quantity,  not\r\n\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Oswald, an economist at Warwick University, was\r\n\r\nquoted in the same article:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Governments can set low pay and still get workers. It\r\n\r\nis  the  quality  that will adjust.  I doubt whether  western\r\n\r\ndemocracies have fully grasped this.  Governments still  tend\r\n\r\nto count the warm bodies applying for occupations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not this Government. It goes for quality, not\r\n\r\nmerely warm bodies, and certainly not seat-warmers.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy we have performance bonuses for political office-holders,\r\n\r\none  of  the few countries in the world to do so.   Ministers\r\n\r\nare  paid in accordance with their performance.  I shall  now\r\n\r\nask  the Clerk of Parliament to hand out a table (Cols.  629-630)  showing the distribution of performance bonus  received\r\n\r\nby political office-holders.  [Copies of table distributed to\r\n\r\nhon.  Members.]   This is to answer the point  raised  by  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh that the performance of office-holders  should\r\n\r\nbe  properly evaluated (Table 1).  From the Table,  you  will\r\n\r\nsee  that only three Ministers received performance bonus  of\r\n\r\nmore  than four months, and the most number of Ministers  was\r\n\r\nin  the 3-4 months category.  We have been stringent with our\r\n\r\nevaluation.  The office-holders were given similar tables  at\r\n\r\nthe time they received their performance bonus.  So they knew\r\n\r\nhow they have been evaluated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000630/20000630-HA-0720629.htm\">Table - Performance Bonus Distribution for Political Office-holders (Cols. 629-630)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also insist on self-renewal. MPs and Ministers, even\r\n\r\nthough they are performing well, will at the right time, have\r\n\r\nto make way for younger people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, Permanent Secretaries too, even if they are\r\n\r\ngood,  will  have to make way for younger people.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nyounger people with high potential will not stay long  enough\r\n\r\nto become Permanent Secretaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Timing of Salary Revision</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs have told me that while they support the salary\r\n\r\nrevision for the public sector, they are concerned about  the\r\n\r\ntiming because the CPF cut has not yet been fully restored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons why we are proceeding with the\r\n\r\nsalary revision now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in November 1994, when we debated the White Paper\r\n\r\non  Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government,\r\n\r\nwe  said that the salary benchmarks would be reviewed in five\r\n\r\nyears' time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the gap between private sector and public sector\r\n\r\npay  has become a gulf since the start of the Asian financial\r\n\r\ncrisis.  This is because the Government froze the salaries of\r\n\r\nMinisters and top civil servants during the crisis.  This was\r\n\r\ndespite  the  fact  that the salaries  were  due  for  upward\r\n\r\nrevision.   For  example, the private  sector  benchmark  for\r\n\r\nMinisters' salaries at Staff Grade 1 had increased by 13%  in\r\n\r\n1998 and 29% in 1999.  Not to adjust the Ministers' and civil\r\n\r\nservants'  pay now when we have emerged from the  crisis  and\r\n\r\nresumed  strong  growth,  and especially  when  it  is  fully\r\n\r\njustified by the private sector benchmarks, is to fall into a\r\n\r\nstate of paralysis experienced by governments elsewhere  when\r\n\r\nthey  faced the issue of public sector pay revision.  Because\r\n\r\nthey  were  unable to keep the salaries competitive vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nthe private sector, inevitably, their countries saw a decline\r\n\r\nin the quality of people wanting to be MPs, Ministers, judges\r\n\r\nand civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not, however, insensitive to workers' feelings\r\n\r\nand  public  sentiments.  Because the CPF cut  has  not  been\r\n\r\nfully  restored, we are not restoring immediately the pay  of\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  top  civil servants  to  the  private  sector\r\n\r\nbenchmark  for  Staff Grade I, but phasing it in  over  three\r\n\r\nyears.   These office-holders will receive only  80%  of  the\r\n\r\nbenchmark in the first year.  The basic monthly salary for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinisters  will  therefore increase by only 0.3%  this  year.\r\n\r\nWith  bonuses, the annual increase for Ministers  will  be  a\r\n\r\nmodest 12%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Today's Realities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In debating the salary revisions, let me remind you of\r\n\r\nsome realities we cannot run away from.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we are seeing a global convergence in the pay of\r\n\r\ntop executives.  Globalisation and technological advances  in\r\n\r\ntransportation  and  communication  have  led  to  increasing\r\n\r\nmobility  of  this group of people.  They are  able  to  move\r\n\r\neasily  around  the  world in search of the  best  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities.    If   they   do  not   get   internationally\r\n\r\ncompetitive  remuneration in their country, they  can  easily\r\n\r\nuproot  for  other more favourable opportunities  in  another\r\n\r\ncountry.   Companies are therefore increasingly pressured  to\r\n\r\npay  internationally competitive salaries for top executives,\r\n\r\nregardless in which country they operate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our job of retaining talents is made more\r\n\r\ndifficult  because  Singaporeans, with their  proficiency  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  and  high  competence,  are  mobile  and  in   great\r\n\r\ninternational  demand.    American  universities   and   MNCs\r\n\r\nregularly  cream  off  our scholars and bright  students  who\r\n\r\nstudy in the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must make a rapid transition to a knowledge-based economy. We have done the easier parts like building\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,   putting   in  place   a   business-friendly\r\n\r\nenvironment, and training our workers for skilled jobs.   The\r\n\r\nnext  phase  is much more difficult.  We have to  create  new\r\n\r\nproducts  and services ourselves and not merely add value  to\r\n\r\nother  people's  products.   With globalization  and  the  IT\r\n\r\nrevolution,  competition has heightened.  It is  a  new  ball\r\n\r\ngame altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, what all this means is that the wages of top\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  talents in Singapore will  face  significant\r\n\r\nupward pressure in the years to come.  Companies in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill have to pay their top\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlocal  executives  internationally  competitive  salaries  to\r\n\r\nretain  them.   Certainly, they have to  pay  internationally\r\n\r\ncompetitive  salaries for foreign talents.  But  let  me  add\r\n\r\nhere  that  expatriates are excluded from the calculation  of\r\n\r\nthe salary benchmarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has no choice but to match these upward\r\n\r\ntrends  in  private sector pay in order to attract  its  fair\r\n\r\nshare of talents.  But the Government does not intend to be a\r\n\r\nprice-setter.  It will not lead the pace of pay  revision  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  will only be a price-taker.   We  will  only\r\n\r\nrespond  to the trends in the private sector, with a  lag  of\r\n\r\none   year,   to  ensure  that  public  sector  pay   remains\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reality we cannot escape from is the widening\r\n\r\nincome  gap  between the top and bottom  earners.   In  every\r\n\r\nsociety,  there will be a bottom 10% and a top  10%  of  wage\r\n\r\nearners.   The  Government  cannot  artificially  reduce  the\r\n\r\nincome  gap  between these two segments of the population  by\r\n\r\nforcing  upwards the salaries of the bottom 10%,  or  forcing\r\n\r\ndownwards  the  salaries of the top 10%.  This  is  a  market\r\n\r\neconomy, not a command economy.  What the Government will do,\r\n\r\nhowever,  is  to ensure that all Singaporeans have  an  equal\r\n\r\nopportunity to make it to the top 10%.  At the same time,  we\r\n\r\nwill  help  the  relatively poor to  ensure  that  they  also\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  the  general  increase  in  prosperity.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment has already put in place a system of subsidies for\r\n\r\neducation,  housing  and  health.  It  has  also  implemented\r\n\r\nseveral  assets-enhancement programmes.  We will continue  to\r\n\r\nhelp the lower-income Singaporeans increase their assets,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as improve their earning capacity through training  and\r\n\r\nskills upgrading.  We will give them hope through investments\r\n\r\nin their children's education and future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prime Minister, I have travelled widely and seen many\r\n\r\ngovernments  at  work.  Our Ministers  can  stand  their  own\r\n\r\nagainst  most  of their counterparts elsewhere.   We  have  a\r\n\r\nCabinet Singapore can be proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My most urgent job now is to make sure that there will\r\n\r\nbe  a  successor  team  which can manage Singapore's  complex\r\n\r\neconomy  in  an increasingly competitive global  environment,\r\n\r\nand  which  also understands the concerns of the  man-in-the-street.   I  can build up this team only if we  are  able  to\r\n\r\npersuade good men and women into politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty here is that a political career is not\r\n\r\nthe natural or first choice of most able Singaporeans.  Other\r\n\r\nmajor  advanced  countries too, like the US,  face  the  same\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to overcome this problem. Singapore has left\r\n\r\nbehind the revolutionary stage where leaders emerged to  lead\r\n\r\na  historic movement with little thought of pay.  We are in a\r\n\r\nsteady state of development where fortunes can be made in the\r\n\r\nbuzz of the private sector.  There is much excitement in  the\r\n\r\nnew  world of dotcoms, financial services, life sciences  and\r\n\r\nR&D.   Most  able Singaporeans prefer to seek  fulfilment  in\r\n\r\nthese challenges rather than in politics.  If we fail to  get\r\n\r\na group of these bright, able and honest Singaporeans to form\r\n\r\nthe political core of Singapore, then over time, the standard\r\n\r\nof government will go down, and Singapore will crumble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is vulnerable. It does not have any natural\r\n\r\nresources  except our people.  Our people have been fortunate\r\n\r\nto  be led by a good and competent Government since 1959.  It\r\n\r\nwill  be very shortsighted and costly for Singaporeans if  we\r\n\r\ngrudge good Ministers their due, and settle for lesser men in\r\n\r\nGovernment in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone through the proposed revisions to public\r\n\r\nsector  salaries  and  salary benchmarks  thoroughly.   I  am\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  they  are fair.  I do  not  think  they  are\r\n\r\ngenerous,  given  the  Ministers' huge  responsibilities  and\r\n\r\nimpact on our people's lives.  I want the right people to  do\r\n\r\nthese jobs.  And so should you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Ministers' pay is a source of envy for some people\r\n\r\nis  not necessarily bad.  We are more likely to recruit  good\r\n\r\nMinisters this way.  I would be extremely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworried if it were the reverse.  If Ministers envy the pay of\r\n\r\ntheir  counterparts in the private sector, that is the  first\r\n\r\nstep towards corruption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have advised me that we must deal with the\r\n\r\nemotional  reaction of Singaporeans over the salary revision.\r\n\r\nThey  themselves  support the market-based salaries  but  are\r\n\r\nconcerned that the man-in-the-street will not understand  why\r\n\r\nMinisters have to be paid high salaries.  I understand  these\r\n\r\nemotions.   But I have faith in the judgment and  rationality\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans.  I have no doubt that some Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nreact  emotionally and will not accept our arguments.  But  I\r\n\r\nbelieve most Singaporeans will listen to the logic and make a\r\n\r\nrational decision.  They have always done so.  A rational and\r\n\r\npractical  approach to problems has always  been  Singapore's\r\n\r\nhallmark.   Otherwise, Singapore will  not  be  where  it  is\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, let me go back to my Williams College days.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered what has happened to my classmates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened to my Ethiopian friend, who already\r\n\r\nhad six children at Williams College?  He was a high official\r\n\r\nin the government of the late deposed Emperor Haile Selassie.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my Yugoslav friend from Croatia, I wonder whether\r\n\r\nhis   children  had  to  fight  fellow  Yugoslavs  to  become\r\n\r\nCroatians?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the Pakistani official from East Pakistan who\r\n\r\nbecame  a Bangladeshi?  His government house overlooking  the\r\n\r\nport of Chittagong was shelled during the war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there were other classmates who have done\r\n\r\nwell,  retiring  in  high government  positions.   But  their\r\n\r\ncountries  have not lived up to their dreams when  they  were\r\n\r\nyoung  men at Williams College, eager to learn and  eager  to\r\n\r\nput into practice what they had learnt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real lesson for me from Williams College was:\r\n\r\nwithout a good government,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  the  good  theories  of economic development  count  for\r\n\r\nnothing.   Countries  with weak or bad  governments  will  go\r\n\r\ndownhill, suffer internal strife and may even break up.  They\r\n\r\nwill  not  be able to deliver a high standard of  living  for\r\n\r\ntheir  people.  And when a country goes down, it is  not  the\r\n\r\nable  people  who  will suffer most.  It is  the  man-in-the-street.  They are the people who cannot migrate easily.  They\r\n\r\nare the ones who need a good government most.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So ask yourself, \"Where will Singapore be 30 years from\r\n\r\nnow?  What type of government will produce you a safe, stable\r\n\r\nand prosperous Singapore?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me help you answer the questions by giving you some\r\n\r\nsimple arithmetic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the wage cost of all the political office-holders\r\n\r\nwill be $34 million after this pay revision.  There are three\r\n\r\nmillion  Singaporeans.  What is the cost  of  Government  per\r\n\r\ncapita?   $11  per year or about five plates  of  \"char  kway\r\n\r\nteow\" per Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in 1995, the Government made a contribution of\r\n\r\n$200  into  the CPF account of all Singaporeans aged  21  and\r\n\r\nabove and an additional pro-rated contribution of up to  $300\r\n\r\nto  those  who had contributed $750 themselves to  their  CPF\r\n\r\naccount.   The total amount paid out was about $800  million.\r\n\r\nWhat was the pay-out per Singaporean?  $270, if we divide  it\r\n\r\nby a population of three million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can do more such CPF top-ups in future, provided we\r\n\r\nhave  good  growth.  $11 per capita per year for a Government\r\n\r\nthat can produce good economic growth and give you $270, even\r\n\r\nif it is once in five years, is surely good value for money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summing up, it is wrong to focus on the individual pay\r\n\r\nof  Ministers in isolation.  He is only a member of  a  team.\r\n\r\nYou  should  focus  on  the cost of  my  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nbenefits and consequences of having that Government.  What is\r\n\r\nthe  cost of my Government to each Singaporean?  Five  plates\r\n\r\nof \"char kway teow\"!  What was the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprice each of us would have paid if our economy had shrunk by\r\n\r\n5%  during the financial crisis?  $3,166!  And this price  is\r\n\r\nonly  an example of the huge price you have to pay for a weak\r\n\r\nor bad government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put in place a virtuous cycle of good\r\n\r\nGovernment, economic growth and benefits for the people.  For\r\n\r\nyour own benefit, it is wise for you to strengthen, not break\r\n\r\nthis cycle.  [Applause]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification\r\n\r\nfrom the Prime Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Prime Minister also\r\n\r\nconclude in his proposed thesis that the higher the Ministers\r\n\r\nare paid, the higher the return in benefit for the people?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, when you do a doctoral thesis,\r\n\r\nyou  do not do such a simple correlation that the higher  the\r\n\r\npay,  the more the benefits for the people. You have to  look\r\n\r\nat  what  the Government can deliver and if you need to  have\r\n\r\nhigh  pay  to  attract good people into government,  then  of\r\n\r\ncourse, there is a link between that and the per capita  GDP.\r\n\r\nWhere  you  have  high pay, and you pay  people  who  do  not\r\n\r\nmeasure  up, then of course your performance cannot increase.\r\n\r\nSo  the link is not between the high pay. The link is between\r\n\r\ngood people whom you have to attract with the right pay.   In\r\n\r\nour  context, it has to be related to the market, and you see\r\n\r\nthe  results  later  on.  What I am  saying  is,  judge  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  totality for what it has performed.   Do  not\r\n\r\nlook  at  individual Ministers' pay alone.  Look at the  wage\r\n\r\ncost  of Government as a whole, the benefits to you, and  the\r\n\r\nprice of a bad government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I rise to support the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister's statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not touch on the salary adjustments of the\r\n\r\ncivil servants as I think that is less controversial than the\r\n\r\nissue  of  the Ministers' salary which is tied to the  public\r\n\r\nsector salary adjustment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had extensive debates before, inside and outside\r\n\r\nthis  House,  on  the  issue  of the  amount  that  political\r\n\r\nappointment holders and, in particular, a Minister, should be\r\n\r\ngetting as his salary.  Mr Chiam had earlier alluded  to  the\r\n\r\nfact that to the average Singaporeans who may not be paid  as\r\n\r\nmuch, especially to the fair number of Singaporeans who  earn\r\n\r\nless than $24,000 a year, the idea of a Minister getting more\r\n\r\nthan a million dollars is beyond comprehension.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first brush, there seems to be a sense of inequity to\r\n\r\nthis.  Somehow, many Singaporeans feel that it is  not  right\r\n\r\nthat  there should be such a divide between the masses and  a\r\n\r\nsmall   number  of  political  elite  who,  as  the  people's\r\n\r\nrepresentatives, should reward themselves so handsomely  with\r\n\r\nsuch salaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against this thinking, there is a sense that the\r\n\r\npeople have made deep sacrifices, as was acknowledged by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister earlier, when the Government decided  to  cut\r\n\r\ntheir CPF contribution following the recent financial crisis.\r\n\r\nTheir  CPF contribution has not been fully restored  to  date\r\n\r\nand  there  are constant calls for the Government to  restore\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  contribution to the level  before  the  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis.   Therefore, for some, it seems odd that  while  they\r\n\r\nare  making the sacrifices by taking pay cuts, the  political\r\n\r\nappointment  holders and civil servants should be  increasing\r\n\r\ntheir salaries at this time.  Many Singaporeans may feel that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should continue to set the  example,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  had  said earlier, by keeping the salary freeze  until\r\n\r\nsuch  time  when CPF contribution has been fully restored  to\r\n\r\nthe people and the economy shows robust growth again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministerial Statement unfortunately also comes at a\r\n\r\ntime   and   hot  on  the  heels  of  the  recent  spate   of\r\n\r\nannouncements of cost increases. These include, for instance,\r\n\r\nthe  $2  charge on POSB accounts for those who  maintain  low\r\n\r\ndeposits,  and the recent announcement of revision  to  water\r\n\r\nrates,  increase in transportation charges, and other private\r\n\r\nsector led charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, we know that the recovery of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy  is rather selective and  not  across  the\r\n\r\nboard. The construction industry is still in the doldrums and\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans are still unemployed.  At my MPS alone,  I\r\n\r\nget  many  requests from my constituents for help in  looking\r\n\r\nfor jobs.  They are the ones who have been retrenched and are\r\n\r\nnot so employable on account of age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the backdrop of the present scenario, many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans may be asking:  how can the Government  increase\r\n\r\nthe  salary  of  civil  servants  and  political  appointment\r\n\r\nholders?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not deny, Sir, that the issue of Ministers' salary\r\n\r\nhas  always been a very emotive one. For reasons that I shall\r\n\r\nelaborate  later,  I support the move by  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the public sector salary.  Let me examine  some  of\r\n\r\nthe arguments raised against the salary revision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as was alluded to by Mr Chiam, the inequity\r\n\r\nargument, ie, the growing gap in income distribution  between\r\n\r\nthe  top  and  bottom income earners and the  fact  that  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution has not been fully restored.  Sir, the  argument\r\n\r\nof  social inequity is based on the idea of equal misery  for\r\n\r\nall.  The  argument simply put is this:  as long as there  is\r\n\r\ninequality  of  income  distribution  and  as  long  as   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution   has   not  been  fully   restored,   political\r\n\r\nappointment holders, least of all, should be allowed to  have\r\n\r\nsalary revision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can this argument be tenable? Against this argument, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  ask ourselves the kind of society we want to  build\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore.  I do not think for a moment that  a  country\r\n\r\nfounded on a political philosophy of equal misery for all  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to bring about more wealth for the people in the  long\r\n\r\nterm.   Let us recognise a basic principle here.   We  are  a\r\n\r\nmarket  economy where talents and resources are allocated  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of pricing.  You want the best talent, you must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to pay for the best talent; and by talent,  I  mean\r\n\r\nnot  only people with the ability to run the country well but\r\n\r\nalso the honesty and integrity to run it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the detractors, I have a question. Would you rather\r\n\r\npay  the  political  appointment holders a  fraction  of  the\r\n\r\nsalary  and  have either people without the ability  to  take\r\n\r\ncharge of our Government and make a mess of Singapore or have\r\n\r\npeople whose only interest in coming to public office  is  to\r\n\r\ncream  off the system and line their pockets in the  process?\r\n\r\nLet  us  be  honest about it.  Talent is in short  supply  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We want to attract the best talents to serve this\r\n\r\ncountry. For them, they will have to come out of the  comfort\r\n\r\nzones  of  their  established  careers  and  family  for  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   It  is  indeed  a  sacrifice  for  many  who  have\r\n\r\nestablished themselves in their career.  They have to make  a\r\n\r\njudgement  call  by  resigning their  jobs  and  serving  the\r\n\r\ncountry  as political appointment holders.  We all know  that\r\n\r\nthere is no assurance that they will succeed in the long  run\r\n\r\nas  political appointment holders, having made the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore quite clear that some sacrifices  would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to ask them to make near complete sacrifice or\r\n\r\neven  total sacrifice in the service of the country is a very\r\n\r\nnaive  thing  to  do,  Mr  Chiam.  These  people  have  their\r\n\r\nmortgages to pay, their children to look after and a  certain\r\n\r\nlifestyle  to keep. His calculation of $50,000 is a  relative\r\n\r\nthing.  To the very poor in the poorest country in the world,\r\n\r\nyour  lifestyle would be obscenely rich.  I think it is quite\r\n\r\ninappropriate to just pluck a figure out of thin air  and  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  it  is  appropriate  by  your  standard  and  your\r\n\r\njudgement.   Let the person who is deemed by the  power  that\r\n\r\nbe, who is capable of running this country, decide whether or\r\n\r\nnot  it is a sacrifice that is worth making and paying at the\r\n\r\npoint in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the call to political office to serve the\r\n\r\ncountry is not a call to priesthood. They are not expected to\r\n\r\nlive  the  life  of  an ascetic.  Even in Israel,  where  the\r\n\r\ncountry  has  for years had prime ministers who lived  rather\r\n\r\nascetic  lives,  has  had  to face down  two  major  scandals\r\n\r\nrecently, when their President and former Prime Minister came\r\n\r\nunder investigation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  allegations of corruption.  If a salary adjustment is  in\r\n\r\norder, and having lived with a wage freeze for the last three\r\n\r\nyears, why should we begrudge this adjustment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not a basket case where our people live from hand\r\n\r\nto  mouth. We can afford the salary increase and we  want  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to have people at the top who will be able  to  give\r\n\r\nall  of us, and not just some Singaporeans, a better life  in\r\n\r\nthe new economy.  We had a discussion earlier about the issue\r\n\r\nof  growing income disparity between the poor and the rich in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  question that we have to ask  ourselves  is\r\n\r\nwhether  we  want  to  pay the right people  at  the  top  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  create wealth for Singapore and  to  close  the\r\n\r\nincome  gap in the process.  If the answer is yes, should  we\r\n\r\nnot  be  willing  to pay the price?  The Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\ngiven  us  a very lucid illustration earlier and I think  the\r\n\r\nexample is very telling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some Singaporeans, I suspect, may well support\r\n\r\nthe  pay  increase but would say that it is inappropriate  to\r\n\r\nimplement this at this stage with the recent spate  of  price\r\n\r\nincreases.   Sir, with all due respect, I do not  think  that\r\n\r\nthe two issues are necessarily related. What this argument is\r\n\r\ntantamount  to  saying  is  that  because  there  are   price\r\n\r\nincreases,   political  appointees  must  not   have   salary\r\n\r\nadjustments.  Why should the political appointment holders be\r\n\r\nany different? Are the promoters of this argument saying that\r\n\r\nwages  for  all  employees should be frozen?  Quite  clearly,\r\n\r\nSir, the argument is non-sequitur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have heard the argument making its rounds\r\n\r\nthat  the  political  appointment  holder  who  is  paid  the\r\n\r\nequivalent of private sector salary may not be able  to  hold\r\n\r\nhis own in the private sector once he leaves the comfort zone\r\n\r\nof  the public service. This applies to political appointment\r\n\r\nholders  who have never worked in the private sector  before.\r\n\r\nAgain, I find this argument rather difficult to follow.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  believe  that  we have used the salaries  of  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  as  a benchmark to allow us to (1) attract  and  keep\r\n\r\nthose  from the private sector with the necessary ability  to\r\n\r\nserve the country;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand,  more  importantly,  (2) to recognise  the  ability  and\r\n\r\ncontribution  of political appointment holders who  have  led\r\n\r\nthe country well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the cynicism of some Singaporeans on the ability of our\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders who never really went through the  baptism\r\n\r\nof fire in the private sector that I want to touch on briefly\r\n\r\nfor  now. The argument is simply this.  We pay Ministers  top\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  salaries.  Can they really  perform  to  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of expectation required of the remuneration that  they\r\n\r\nenjoy  if  they went to the private sector?  In other  words,\r\n\r\nwould  they  have  earned as much if they  actually  took  on\r\n\r\nprivate sector jobs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that to take this line of argument is to\r\n\r\nconfuse the issue.  Let me explain.  I am a solicitor  and  I\r\n\r\nearn  an  income.  I should not be expected to earn the  same\r\n\r\nsalary  as  a doctor if I tried to do the work of  a  doctor.\r\n\r\nThis is because I am not qualified and, more importantly, may\r\n\r\nnot  be suited for the job.  The two are not the same.  I  am\r\n\r\npaid  my salary which may be comparable to a doctor's  salary\r\n\r\nbecause of what I do as a lawyer.  Nobody begrudges the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  I earn as much as a doctor.  By the same token, we  use\r\n\r\nthe private sector salary as a benchmark.  That does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  we should expect all political appointment  holders  to\r\n\r\nhave  the same talent to be a top doctor, lawyer or a banker.\r\n\r\nWhat the benchmark does in addition is to provide a basis for\r\n\r\nvaluing  the  ability  of those in the public  service.   Why\r\n\r\nshould they be valued any less simply because they are in the\r\n\r\npublic  sector?   Clearly, this approach to  pay  our  public\r\n\r\noffice appointment holders well has been proven right, as was\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, because the last round of financial crisis\r\n\r\nhas  spared this country of the misery that we have  seen  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.  Is this not proof of the quality of the leaders\r\n\r\nthat we have?  In other words, the benchmark is arguably  our\r\n\r\nway  of remunerating them for the quality of skills that they\r\n\r\nhave brought about in running this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Sir, we have to ask ourselves:\r\n\r\nare  we prepared to pay the price for top leadership?  Is  it\r\n\r\nworth it?  I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould say that at least for us, the system is transparent and\r\n\r\nit is worth every cent of it.  We know how much we are paying\r\n\r\nour  public servants; or do we want a system where  political\r\n\r\nappointment  holders are paid little, and the  true  cost  of\r\n\r\nleadership  is not known until perhaps the leaders  fall  and\r\n\r\ncorruption investigations begin?  Sir, to my mind, the answer\r\n\r\nis obvious.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This is done in  order  to  maintain,\r\n\r\nstrengthen and continue the system that has stood us in  good\r\n\r\nstead.  In the past few decades, our system has brought about\r\n\r\nan improvement in the quality of life of our people.  Ours is\r\n\r\nan  open,  transparent  system which  practises  meritocracy.\r\n\r\nUnder this system, our leaders are not allowed to abuse their\r\n\r\npowers  and to amass a great amount of wealth for themselves.\r\n\r\nUnlike other countries where greed and corruption have become\r\n\r\nrife  and  rampant, in Singapore, there is no room for  money\r\n\r\npolitics and Ministers do not have dubious extra benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pragmatic to link Ministers' pay with those top\r\n\r\nearners  in  the private sector as their salaries should  not\r\n\r\nlag  far behind those top earners in the private sector.   We\r\n\r\nshould  attract the most capable and talented people to  come\r\n\r\nforward  to  join  the  Government by  ensuring   that  their\r\n\r\nsalaries should not lag far too behind those of their friends\r\n\r\nin the private sector.  We must attract the best and the most\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetent to enter politics.  Of course, they should  not  be\r\n\r\nmotivated  by  greed. They should come out  spontaneously  to\r\n\r\ntake  part  in  the  process  of  renewal  of  our  political\r\n\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the pay revision, our Prime Minister's pay is\r\n\r\n$1.94 million, which is equivalent to the pay of the 63rd top\r\n\r\nearner  in  the private sector.  Prime Minister Goh  and  his\r\n\r\nteam  have  led the people  through the financial crisis  and\r\n\r\nthey have been able to turn a deficit of $5.1 billion into  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  of  S$3.2  billion.   The  Prime  Minister's  yearly\r\n\r\nremuneration of $1.94 million is about 50 cents for  each  of\r\n\r\nthe  4  million people.  This is the negligible  amount  they\r\n\r\nhave to pay to hire a helmsman.  Is 50 cents too high a price\r\n\r\nto pay?  Of course, we can each pay 10 cents a year to get  a\r\n\r\nhelmsman, but that helmsman is a helmsman of a tongkang or  a\r\n\r\nsampan.   And a sampan or tongkang cannot carry four  million\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I re-read Senior Minister Lee's Memoirs, my belief\r\n\r\nin  the  importance  of good Government  leaders  is  further\r\n\r\nenhanced.  From the time we entered Malaysia and the time  we\r\n\r\nwere  separated  from it, if not for  the  Senior  Minister's\r\n\r\nwisdom and sharp political judgment, we would be sitting here\r\n\r\ntoday as a city council and not Parliament, and the issues we\r\n\r\nwould be discussing would be to get more financial allocation\r\n\r\nfrom the central government or to get loans from the IMF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am saying all these just to tell the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore that what we should worry about  is  not\r\n\r\npay  increases for the Ministers, but  whether we can get the\r\n\r\nbest  people to become our leaders and to practise the system\r\n\r\nof  meritocracy.  We must retain the best talent in our civil\r\n\r\nservice  and Cabinet.  If we lose them, it will be a loss  to\r\n\r\nthe nation.  Of course, of equal importance is that we should\r\n\r\nnot  forget  those low-income earners who work hard  for  the\r\n\r\nnation.  In this respect, I am glad to hear Minister  BG  Yeo\r\n\r\nonce  again  assuring the House yesterday that the Government\r\n\r\nwould continue to provide affordable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhousing  and healthcare to the lower-income group, and  would\r\n\r\ncontinue to invest heavily in education and training, thereby\r\n\r\nensuring the employability of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good government will ensure that the children of all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, rich or poor, will have equal opportunities  to\r\n\r\nbe  educated  and  to  be promoted to a  better  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good leaders will make the lower-income people feel, at\r\n\r\nall  times,  that whenever they encounter  difficulties,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would be around to lend them a helping hand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The politics of meritocracy not only enables the top talents\r\n\r\nto  scale  the peak but also continues to provide the  lower-income  people with the hope and the twilight that  they  and\r\n\r\ntheir  children  will be led to enjoy a  better  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Statement made by the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the remaining items on the Order Paper for\r\n\r\ntoday  be  exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CIVIL SERVICE NWC AWARD, PUBLIC SECTOR SALARY REVISIONS,</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>AND REVIEW OF SALARY BENCHMARKS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  first  of all, on behalf of the trade unions,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank  the Government for agreeing  to  credit  the\r\n\r\nunused  portions of the annual $350 cap on outpatient subsidy\r\n\r\nfor  civil  servants who are on the Medisave  and  Subsidised\r\n\r\nOutpatient  Treatment (MSO) scheme into the Medisave  account\r\n\r\nof the officers.

This\r\n\r\nis  a  vast world with blurred boundaries.  Compared  to  the\r\n\r\ntime when we detached ourselves from the British rule some 40\r\n\r\nyears ago, the Singapore of today has seen a 70-fold increase\r\n\r\nin  our GDP.   We have already attained great achievements in\r\n\r\nsocial  and  economic  fields.   Recently,  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board handed out the 800,000th key to  the  owner\r\n\r\nof  a brand new HDB flat.   90% of Singaporeans own their own\r\n\r\nflats.  Even among the bottom 10% of our people, some 65% own\r\n\r\ntheir 3-room or bigger HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have read in various literature and newspapers\r\n\r\nthat  different people in different regions, irrespective  of\r\n\r\ntheir  races and nationalities, have some common aspirations.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not want to be dependent on others.  They  wish  to\r\n\r\nhave  their  own  homes.  They also hope that their  children\r\n\r\nhave  education and everybody craves for the  country  to  be\r\n\r\nprosperous  and  the people live in peace and  harmony.  They\r\n\r\nhope  that their children will grow up healthily, live  in  a\r\n\r\nsafe  country and have jobs that provide them with  a  stable\r\n\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at all these hopes and aspirations.\r\n\r\nWe  all  feel that, as Singaporeans, we should be very  proud\r\n\r\nand happy because many of  those things that remain as dreams\r\n\r\nfor  the  people  in many parts of the world  have  become  a\r\n\r\nreality in Singapore.  Most, if not all, of the Singaporeans'\r\n\r\ndreams have become realities.  We must continue to put in our\r\n\r\nefforts  to  ensure that our people, especially  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration,  will continue to enjoy this kind  of  very  good\r\n\r\nsocial environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of mine once told me that there are three types\r\n\r\nof  government  in the world.  The first type  of  government\r\n\r\nconsists  of those who sit back and depend on their  national\r\n\r\nresources to finance the government's spending and eventually\r\n\r\nsquander away all the national wealth.  The second type is  a\r\n\r\ngovernment consisting of people who work very hard to  create\r\n\r\nwealth  -  for  themselves.  The third type is  a  government\r\n\r\ncomprising\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nable  people  who work hard to create wealth for the  country\r\n\r\nand  help  the people to enhance their assets and  share  the\r\n\r\nfruits of success brought about by the government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot find anywhere on the map of the world any\r\n\r\nother country like the little red dot of Singapore.  Yet, our\r\n\r\nsystem  and  our hardworking people have made us  outstanding\r\n\r\nand  different.  It is only here in Singapore  that  we  have\r\n\r\nthis  kind of transparency to discuss the question of how  to\r\n\r\nimplement meritocracy for good government to continue to help\r\n\r\nthe  country prosper and develop.  What we want in this  kind\r\n\r\nof  system of transparency is reward based on merit.  Because\r\n\r\nwe  do  not want to be like many other countries in the world\r\n\r\nwhich  have  fallen  into  the  pit  of  quicksand  of  money\r\n\r\npolitics.   Neither  do we want to be  a  country  using  the\r\n\r\n\"little  above  board and plenty under  the  table\"  kind  of\r\n\r\nreward system.  As a matter of fact, this kind of transparent\r\n\r\nsalary  system for our Ministers and civil servants who  have\r\n\r\nsacrificed  a lot, is one which can be described as  a  \"win-win\" system for both the Ministers and the masses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is often quoted by the Opposition Member, \"After\r\n\r\nall, the wool still comes from the sheep's back.\" (meaning in\r\n\r\nthe  long  run,  whatever you are given,  you  pay  for  it).\r\n\r\nHowever,  we must stress that if you want to have  the  wool,\r\n\r\nyou  must  also  ensure that the sheep  can  grow  with  good\r\n\r\nhealth.   Then only will we have the wool to shear.   Let  me\r\n\r\ngive  you  another  illustration. If a farmer  can  rear  the\r\n\r\nchickens  well,  then he will have eggs to harvest,  and  the\r\n\r\nbetter  your  chicken, the better eggs you will  get.   If  a\r\n\r\nfarmer  has  developed a special skill to  make  his  chicken\r\n\r\nproduce  golden  eggs, then the golden  eggs  should  be  his\r\n\r\nrewards.   On  the  contrary, if the farmer cannot  rear  his\r\n\r\nchickens  well, then he gets only sick or even dead chickens.\r\n\r\nHe can forget about having eggs to eat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying that people need food to\r\n\r\nsustain  their  lives, while the nation  is  built  upon  its\r\n\r\npeople.   Our  leaders and civil servants have to  work  very\r\n\r\nhard\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  earn  their  rewards.  In Singapore, to become  political\r\n\r\nleaders by itself is a sacrifice.  Like doctors and teachers,\r\n\r\nthe  political  leaders too make their  own  sacrifices.   We\r\n\r\nshould  remunerate  them  well so that  they  would  dedicate\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  serving the nation and  the  people,  without\r\n\r\nhaving to worry about providing for their families and  their\r\n\r\nchildren.   We  often say that for lovers in love,  they  can\r\n\r\nsurvive  on water and fresh air only. But how long  can  they\r\n\r\nsurvive?    If we want our horses to run well, we  must  feed\r\n\r\nthem  well.  How can you deny the horses of their feeds,  yet\r\n\r\nexpect  them to gallop well?  We should not inhibit the  able\r\n\r\nand  talented  people to earn the rewards  which  they  truly\r\n\r\ndeserve.    If   they  are  good,  pay  them  handsomely   to\r\n\r\ncommensurate with what they are worth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open society like Singapore, we should permit\r\n\r\n\"adding  flowers  to brocade\".  As a unionist,  I  feel  that\r\n\r\nwhile  practising \"adding flowers to brocade\", we should  not\r\n\r\nforget  also to \"send hot charcoal to the needy during  snowy\r\n\r\nweather\".    The  Government must try  and  do  its  best  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  the low-income and low-skilled workers so that  they\r\n\r\ntoo would have the opportunity to upgrade themselves and have\r\n\r\na  share in the fruits of  our economic success.  They should\r\n\r\nbe  given  the  necessary assistance in time of  need.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly,   we   must  ensure  that  children   of   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean, irrespective of their family background,  should\r\n\r\nbe given the equal starting point, to receive good education,\r\n\r\nso  that children from the lower-income group will also  have\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to  get out of the poverty trap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a widening income gap among the top earners and\r\n\r\nbottom earners.  There is this V-shape going up all the time.\r\n\r\nBut  this  is  not  the  problem.  The  key  is  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment-employer-employee  tripartitism  can  continuously\r\n\r\nwork  together to level up the \"V\", that is, to  continuously\r\n\r\npush up the bottom line of our incomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, we conducted a dialogue session with our\r\n\r\ntrade union leaders.  All\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  raised their hands in support  of  this  salary\r\n\r\nrevision.  So  long  as  the  Government  can  implement  the\r\n\r\nprinciples,  that is, to ensure that the less  fortunate  are\r\n\r\nproperly  looked after, in other words, we must have  a  good\r\n\r\ngovernment so that we can attract investments and create more\r\n\r\njobs  for  the people in Singapore, then we will have a  good\r\n\r\nand  stable  working  environment.   The  trade  unions  will\r\n\r\nsupport this salary revision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade unionists also agree with building the bonus\r\n\r\nsystem  into the scheme. The AUPE representative  hoped  that\r\n\r\nthe   PSD  will  further  enhance  its  transparency  in  the\r\n\r\nevaluation of public sector employees, especially  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  become  trade  union leaders.  If possible,  they  will\r\n\r\nensure  that these trade unionists will not suffer under  the\r\n\r\nscheme.   I hope the Government, in revising the salaries  of\r\n\r\nthe  public sector, will also expedite the work redesign  and\r\n\r\nre-engineering in the public sector so as to further  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  efficiency  of  the public service.   I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  benchmark the bonuses and  other  incentive\r\n\r\nawards  with our GDP and other development indicators.   They\r\n\r\nmust  also  take  into  account  the  social  indicators  and\r\n\r\nstandard of living of the lower-income group.  What  we  want\r\n\r\nis  a  public service that cares, one that does not sacrifice\r\n\r\nthe \"human touch\" for efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthere are no new arguments for the salary increases. They are\r\n\r\nobvious.   They  have been debated thoroughly  but  it  is  a\r\n\r\npopular issue which hits a popular imagination and it is  not\r\n\r\nthe  norm in other countries to pay the market rate  for  the\r\n\r\njob.  We have decided to do this and we know - I know and the\r\n\r\nprime  minister knows - that wherever we go, we  are  greatly\r\n\r\nenvied because they would like to do likewise.  They just  do\r\n\r\nnot have the political strength.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of the last five years, since the debate on\r\n\r\nministerial  salaries  working out this  formula,  have  only\r\n\r\nshown that the formula is a practical method.  Otherwise in a\r\n\r\nfast-changing  globalised economy - we  would  be  repeatedly\r\n\r\ndebating the need for salary revisions.  Instead, we are now\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfine-tuning  the  formula from the average of  the  top  four\r\n\r\nearners to the top eight earners, in six professions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have grappled with this problem for over 30 years from\r\n\r\n1959  to  1990.   I had argued this question  of  ministerial\r\n\r\nsalaries  when I was in the opposition in 1955/56,  45  years\r\n\r\nago.   I  then  urged the chief minister of  the  day,  David\r\n\r\nMarshall,  to be realistic.  His monthly salary  then  was  a\r\n\r\nprincely sum of $3,500 when as a leading lawyer he was making\r\n\r\n$10,000  to $20,000 a month.  I recommended a realistic  pay,\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  his  earnings.  But  he  did  not  have  the\r\n\r\npolitical strength to do it and he left it at $3,500.  So  it\r\n\r\nremained  until I developed sufficient political standing  to\r\n\r\nbe able to tackle the question and raise ministerial salaries\r\n\r\nin the 1970s when the economy had taken off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to recount briefly how we managed in the last\r\n\r\n40  years since 1959 so that you will understand where did we\r\n\r\nstart, how have we arrived at where we are.  As I have  said,\r\n\r\nthe first Cabinet was unusual because it consisted of men who\r\n\r\nhad  been drawn together by the forces of history.   We  were\r\n\r\nyoung  men  in  our  30s and 40s, who had  been  through  the\r\n\r\nsufferings  of the war and the Japanese Occupation.   And  we\r\n\r\nwere  tempered  by that experience.  We wanted  independence,\r\n\r\nand  were  strongly  driven to change  the  economy  and  our\r\n\r\nsociety.   My colleagues were outstanding men, a  core  group\r\n\r\nthat  stayed together from the 1950s to the 1980s, when  they\r\n\r\nretired.  They provided Singapore with 30 years of stability,\r\n\r\nsolid growth and finally a transformed society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But during that period, every few years I came to this\r\n\r\nHouse  to  revise their salaries to catch up  with  the  fast\r\n\r\ngrowth  economy and the ever higher salaries in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.   As  we  raced ahead and became part of  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy,  the salaries of our top people have been pulled  up\r\n\r\nby  those of their counterparts in the advanced countries and\r\n\r\nvice versa for those in the lower ranges.  This trend is  not\r\n\r\nlikely  to be reversed, unless we go into decline,  in  which\r\n\r\ncase,  the  highly-trained  and  highly-skilled  will  leave,\r\n\r\naccelerating\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  fall.   Of  course,  there is no  extrapolation  to  its\r\n\r\nlogical  conclusion,  as  sometimes it  would  stabilise  and\r\n\r\nplateau,  because you cannot have a society  which  keeps  on\r\n\r\ndiverging.   You can see from the protests in  the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  - in America, now in France - that they  also  are\r\n\r\nprotesting  against a globalised economy because their  lower\r\n\r\nend  and  their middle end earners are hurt by the export  of\r\n\r\nindustries,  services and jobs; and they are  really  working\r\n\r\nagainst the interest of the developing world that needs these\r\n\r\nindustries  and jobs.  So I advised the Prime  Minister,  and\r\n\r\nfinally  persuaded him to take this formula of  an  automatic\r\n\r\nadjustment  to Parliament.  The earnings of our  top  earners\r\n\r\nwill continue to go up with the growth of our economy and  so\r\n\r\nmust ministerial salaries.  This is a very strong trend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the growth in the last 10 years: average of\r\n\r\nthe  top  24  in six professions in 1989 (which is  for  1990\r\n\r\nincome  tax) was $1 million.  Five years later,  in  1994  it\r\n\r\nbecame  $1.4 million, an increase of over a third.  In  1999,\r\n\r\nit  was $2.5 million, an increase of three-quarters, just  in\r\n\r\nthe last 10 years.  So had we not had this formula, the prime\r\n\r\nminister would be faced with the awful dilemma of taking  the\r\n\r\n1994 salary and saying, \"Can we revise it by 76%?\"  There are\r\n\r\nlawyers  and  doctors  in this House  -  Shanmugam,  Davinder\r\n\r\nSingh,  Dr  Michael Lim.  They are in the private sector  and\r\n\r\nthey can confirm by how much the earnings of top lawyers  and\r\n\r\ntop  doctors in the private sector have gone up in  the  last\r\n\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tandem with ministerial salaries, and the ministers\r\n\r\nform  the benchmark, are the salaries of those in the  higher\r\n\r\nechelons  in  the  public service, and  they  are  absolutely\r\n\r\ncrucial  officers of the State.  Without good  men  occupying\r\n\r\nthese  positions, we would be unable to maintain our  present\r\n\r\nstandards  -  the  Chief  Justice, judges,  attorney-general,\r\n\r\nauditor-general,  accountant-general, permanent  secretaries,\r\n\r\nCEOs of statutory boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we took over in 1959, we inherited a civil service\r\n\r\nrecruited by the British with very few locals whom they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npicked from the best of a small pool of local talent.  And it\r\n\r\nhas been one unending process of improvisation and adjustment\r\n\r\never  since.  For years, we could not get good lawyers to  be\r\n\r\njudges,  because the disproportionate earnings in the private\r\n\r\nsector  which they have to give up to become a judge make  it\r\n\r\nunrealistic.   Only  after 1990, when  we  had  made  radical\r\n\r\nsalary revisions, and implemented them, has there been a full\r\n\r\npanoply of High Court judges.  And it is an unending struggle\r\n\r\nnow between the private sector, which includes multi-national\r\n\r\nlegal  corporations  in Singapore, and the attorney-general's\r\n\r\noffice and the legal service to compete for top talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain how we have done it in this chamber.\r\n\r\nTo self-renew, MPs and ministers, besides the civil servants,\r\n\r\nwe had to recruit at every election able younger people.  For\r\n\r\nministers, I persuaded, and my colleagues too, able academics\r\n\r\nwith  PhDs  and  professionals to run as MPs, then  appointed\r\n\r\nthem as ministers.  Many did not make it.  The attrition rate\r\n\r\nwas  high.  These scholars had good minds and the ability  to\r\n\r\nmarshal facts and figures, and to present them.  But they did\r\n\r\nnot  have that quality necessary for a minister - \"judgement\"\r\n\r\n-  making  a  decision, the right decision, on the  basis  of\r\n\r\ncomplex and incomplete data.  You cannot wait until you  have\r\n\r\ngot  all  the  facts  in and then decide.   It  is  a  moving\r\n\r\nsituation.   You  have to decide where  the  trend  is,  what\r\n\r\nshould we do.  So I cast around with my colleagues and  tried\r\n\r\nout  successful men, never mind whether they got PhDs or not,\r\n\r\nbut  whether  they had succeeded in the real world,  men  who\r\n\r\nhave been successful in their professions and business and in\r\n\r\ntheir own fields.  The results were better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my ministers were very good at judging people.\r\n\r\nHon  Sui  Sen,  who  was  one  of our  best  civil  servants,\r\n\r\npermanent secretary, head of Economic Development Board,  and\r\n\r\nlater  on  I  persuaded him to become an MP and then  finance\r\n\r\nminister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recommended several, among them people whom he had\r\n\r\nworked with - Goh\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChok   Tong,  S  Dhanabalan,  Tony  Tan.   They  were   three\r\n\r\nheavyweight ministers.  We did not know that when we started.\r\n\r\nWe  recruited them in the 1970s, but we knew them only in the\r\n\r\n1980s.   Each  year,  we also selected 20  to  30  (later  we\r\n\r\nincreased  it  to  100  to  120) of  our  best  students  for\r\n\r\nscholarships  to  study in the best universities  and  bonded\r\n\r\nthem  to serve the government for eight years.  Parents  were\r\n\r\npoorer then, and scholarships were few.   So we had the  pick\r\n\r\nof the crop.  And it is from that generation of the 1960s and\r\n\r\n70s  that  we  have today the present leaders  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  and  the  statutory boards, and quite  a  number  of\r\n\r\nministers, scholars and SAF scholars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the middle-80s, especially in the 90s, our\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions  changed and social  attitudes  altered.\r\n\r\nNow  scholarships are numerous and commonplace.  I  read  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times supplement on scholarships.  Hundreds of  them\r\n\r\nevery year, because they had seen how we had succeeded -  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  the banks, even foreign multi-nationals  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   So the Straits Times devotes a whole  supplement\r\n\r\nto  the  scholarships  on offer, describing,  tabulating  and\r\n\r\ncomparing  them in detail.  Statutory boards, GLCs,  all  the\r\n\r\nbig  banks,  major companies, like NatSteel, MNCs like  Exxon\r\n\r\nMobil,  KPMG  and  American Insurance (AIA),  they  all  give\r\n\r\nscholarships.  They are all chasing a limited pool of  scarce\r\n\r\ntalent.  Moreover, many parents now earn enough to send their\r\n\r\nchildren  abroad to the best universities and do the subjects\r\n\r\nof  their choice and have their children sign no bond, except\r\n\r\nto  the  father and mother, who would agree to whatever  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  do.   This has changed the whole  system  of  early\r\n\r\nrecruitment and nurturing and career development of the  best\r\n\r\nfor  higher  appointments.   For  the  last  few  years,  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  and statutory boards no longer have the  pick  of\r\n\r\nthe  crop.  That means 10, 15 years down the road, we may not\r\n\r\nhave the same quality at the top echelon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon Sui Sen recognised these changed circumstances and\r\n\r\nthe  altered values of our young.   So he persuaded me in the\r\n\r\n1970s to abandon this handcuffing of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngovernment  officers by their pensions.  We were  losing,  he\r\n\r\nsaid, too many good top men who are quite prepared to give up\r\n\r\ntheir  pensions  because  they were  attracted  to  lucrative\r\n\r\ncareers  in  the private sector.  So if we did not  pay  them\r\n\r\npension, we could up their salary and compete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was uneasy because we were departing from an age-old\r\n\r\nsystem.   The  British ran an empire for 200 years  based  on\r\n\r\nlifetime employment in the government service.  But  Hon  Sui\r\n\r\nSen  himself  had spent his whole life in government  service\r\n\r\nand, at the end, he told me, \"Look at my pension!\"  It was  a\r\n\r\npittance  because inflation plus growth meant a  pension  was\r\n\r\nworth  little.   And he was convinced, and finally  convinced\r\n\r\nme, that younger officers no longer considered their pensions\r\n\r\na  strong  pull factor when deciding whether to  stay  or  to\r\n\r\nleave.  They wanted to be paid their worth immediately and so\r\n\r\nwanted to go on CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After much hesitation and reflection, I accepted the\r\n\r\nchange and agreed to abandon pensions in favour of CPF.  This\r\n\r\nled  to the next series of other changes  where salaries have\r\n\r\nto  be regularly adjusted to match their counterparts in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, or we would end up with the second and  third\r\n\r\nbest.   It is a continuous series of exercises.  In  the  old\r\n\r\nsystem, the British recruited straight from the universities;\r\n\r\nwhether you are a law graduate, doctor, accountant, surveyor,\r\n\r\narchitect, they all have similar salary scales.  We inherited\r\n\r\nthat.   We carried that on.  But it was unrelated to reality.\r\n\r\nNobody  can predict which profession would be the high flying\r\n\r\nprofession  when it comes to maturity.  Today it's  the  law.\r\n\r\nTomorrow,  it  could be something else.   At  one  time,  the\r\n\r\narchitects in the building boom had the best returns.  So  we\r\n\r\nnow have decided, as a result of abolishing pensions, that we\r\n\r\nhave to go with the rate for the market in that profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have new multi-faceted problems, because the global\r\n\r\nenvironment has changed and the best, our best whom  we  send\r\n\r\nabroad, are being recruited by top MNCs, also chasing  talent\r\n\r\nand prepared to pay off their bonds.  What is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n$200,000-$300,000  when  you can  get  a  good  mind  already\r\n\r\nproven?   You can watch his school record, you can watch  his\r\n\r\ncollege record, you can see his capabilities in argument,  in\r\n\r\npresentation, and you have a ready-made winner.   Whether  he\r\n\r\nis  a big winner or a small winner, it does not matter.   But\r\n\r\nyou know this is first league.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now take you to how we are now placed. The\r\n\r\npresent  team in the government was selected and  had  worked\r\n\r\nwith  the old guards long before 1990.  The selection started\r\n\r\nin  the 1960s was not very successful because, as I said,  we\r\n\r\ndid not know how to spot who would make a good minister.   So\r\n\r\nwe  chose people who sympathised with our views, and had good\r\n\r\nminds.   But  they  lacked the quality of  making  the  right\r\n\r\ndecisions.  We started to succeed only in the 1970s, after 10\r\n\r\nyears  of  error.  And in 1972, I persuaded Ong Teng  Cheong,\r\n\r\nthen  an architect, to give up his lucrative practice to join\r\n\r\nus.  He took several years to wind up his practice first.  He\r\n\r\nhad  commitments.  Then 1976, Goh Chok Tong,  S.  Dhanabalan,\r\n\r\nand  1979,  Tony  Tan, and so it went on.   There  were  many\r\n\r\nothers.   But,  as  I  said,  the attrition  rate  was  still\r\n\r\nconsiderable.  And at one time, we were so short of ministers\r\n\r\nto  hold  big  ministries, that I persuaded two senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants, top men, proven administrative ability, to  contest\r\n\r\nelections  and  become ministers - Howe Yoon Chong,  who  was\r\n\r\nhead  of  civil service, to become minister for defence,  and\r\n\r\nTeh  Cheang Wan, head of HDB, to become minister for national\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  So it was an unending quest for the  right  man\r\n\r\nto put in the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes many years for a person to be tried and tested\r\n\r\nas  a  minister,  and  to develop that judgement  and  trust.\r\n\r\nEvery cabinet has its core members of the team, goal shooters\r\n\r\nand  goalkeepers.  Not all 11 players can have the same  star\r\n\r\nquality.  And it is the prerogative of the prime minister  to\r\n\r\npick  his  men  and,  having  picked  his  men,  it  is   his\r\n\r\nresponsibility to get them jell into a team and, as  a  team,\r\n\r\nto  deliver.  I have grappled with this problem.  And were it\r\n\r\npossible,  I  would have liked to pay the ministers  the  way\r\n\r\nfootball clubs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npay  their  players.   When you have a star  player  and  you\r\n\r\nchange  clubs,  hundreds of millions of pounds change  hands.\r\n\r\nCould I do it?  I would cause so much public discomfiture for\r\n\r\nthe other ministers who are not goal scorers, that team would\r\n\r\nsoon  be  unable to function as a team.  So a certain balance\r\n\r\nmust  be kept, solidarity of the team and recognition by  the\r\n\r\ncaptain  that  he  is  a  scorer  and  he  is  a  first-class\r\n\r\ngoalkeeper.  Somehow, you have got to get them to  share  not\r\n\r\nonly the glory but also the remuneration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My core members for 25 years, they are well known to the\r\n\r\npublic  - Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam, Hon Sui Sen, Lim  Kim\r\n\r\nSan.   Prime Minister Goh's core team must be obvious to  all\r\n\r\nthose who have watched how his government has performed,  who\r\n\r\nhave scored the goals, or have prevented them from being shot\r\n\r\ninto  our goal.  I leave you to judge.  But the point is that\r\n\r\nall  the present cabinet members, including Lim Hng Kiang and\r\n\r\nTeo  Chee  Hean, were selected before 1990, before I  stepped\r\n\r\ndown.  And since then, only three had made it to ministers of\r\n\r\nstate - Peter Chen, Lim Swee Say, David Lim.  The last intake\r\n\r\nof  MPs was the highest average we ever had.  But there is  a\r\n\r\ndifference between a good player and a Pele.  That is what we\r\n\r\nhave  to  look for, a striker.  If the present team does  not\r\n\r\nget  more good men to join them in the next election in 2002,\r\n\r\nthere will be a hiatus down the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good government did not happen by doing things naturally\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  It was a thorough and meticulous  process  of\r\n\r\nselection and testing.  Finally, I learned how the  big  MNCs\r\n\r\ndid  it in America, using psychologists and psychiatrists  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  and to test before promotion.  And we became  better\r\n\r\nalso at assessing character.  The ability is simple to judge,\r\n\r\nbut  the  character element is very difficult.  But  we  have\r\n\r\nassembled  together the best persons available  and  willing.\r\n\r\nAnd  there is no alternative team, or group of people outside\r\n\r\nthe  government, who can replace this present  team.   I  say\r\n\r\nthis  without  wanting to discourage those who  are  outside.\r\n\r\nThere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  some probably star players outside, but you have got  to\r\n\r\nform  a  team and work as a team.  If this government  should\r\n\r\nfall, standards of government would go down, because from the\r\n\r\nvery  start in 1959, Singapore has had a government which  is\r\n\r\nled  by  ministers,  not  by civil servants.   The  permanent\r\n\r\nsecretaries do not settle policy.  They do not innovate.   It\r\n\r\nis  the  ministers who strike out.  It was Goh Keng Swee  who\r\n\r\nstarted  the Economic Development Board;  Hon Sui Sen started\r\n\r\nNOL; SIA, DBS, so many things.  They are creative men.  It is\r\n\r\nthe opposite of the Japanese system, where top civil servants\r\n\r\nshape  policy.   Therefore, if Singapore does not  have  high\r\n\r\ncalibre  ministers,  our performance  will  degrade  and  our\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  will  stumble  and  social  problems   will\r\n\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we have adequate salaries for ministers removes\r\n\r\nonly  one  of the factors that stand in the way of recruiting\r\n\r\ntalent.   Since the last revision to this formula, the  prime\r\n\r\nminister  has  tried to get many from the private  sector  to\r\n\r\njoin  - top bankers, top CEOs.  He ended up only with  one  - Peter  Chen  from Shell.  Why did the others  decline?   Some\r\n\r\nhave  moved on and become venture capitalists.  Because  they\r\n\r\nare  bright enough and shrewd enough to see, \"Look, I am  40-plus.   If I join you, I will be asked to stay on and on  and\r\n\r\non,  if  I  am successful.  If I am not, I am out.   By  that\r\n\r\ntime,  I  have  lost my connections.\"  Some declined  because\r\n\r\nthey  sized up the ministers and decided they may  not  quite\r\n\r\nmeasure up.  So it is a difficult task.  It removes only  one\r\n\r\nobstacle, but not an insignificant factor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politically, it is not possible for any minister, or any\r\n\r\nMP, or any person to say at the outset that he would not have\r\n\r\ntaken on the task of being a minister if he knew he would not\r\n\r\nbe  adequately compensated.  But what he would do is,  do  it\r\n\r\nfor  a  short term and then excuse himself.  I can  say  this\r\n\r\nbecause I have been at it for over 40 years and anyway  I  am\r\n\r\napproaching  the  end of my career.  So I can  tell  you  the\r\n\r\nblunt  truth.  That period of revolutionary change that threw\r\n\r\nup  people with deep convictions and overpowering motivations\r\n\r\nis over.  That is a fact.  We are in an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nera   of  high  growth  with  fortunes  being  made  by   the\r\n\r\nenterprising, whether in a dot.com company or in  finance  or\r\n\r\nfund  management, or in the professions. And the whole social\r\n\r\nclimate has changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was looking through the latest Forbes magazine which I\r\n\r\nhave  got  by courtesy of SIA because I am a frequent  flyer.\r\n\r\nOne  whole  copy lists out all the billionaires in the  world\r\n\r\nwith short descriptions of how they became what they are.   I\r\n\r\nam quite sure they sell a few hundreds, if not a few thousand\r\n\r\ncopies  in  Singapore. So all our top minds are  reading  and\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Surely he can do it, why not I try?\" So we  have  a\r\n\r\nqualitative  change in aspirations.  And it affects  the  old\r\n\r\nguards  too.  Some  of  them meet me and  say,  \"Look  at  my\r\n\r\npension. This is what we are worth.\"  So I looked at them and\r\n\r\nI  said,  \"But that is the rules we made.\" They said,  \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nSo from time to time, I persuade the prime minister.  I said,\r\n\r\n\"Give  the pensioners a bonus because we are doing well.  But\r\n\r\nfor them, we would not be doing well.\"  But many of them,  if\r\n\r\nI  were to go back and ask them all again, and they knew  the\r\n\r\nprogress that Singapore would make, they would tell me,  \"You\r\n\r\ncarry  on.  I will stay out.\" This is the real world. We  are\r\n\r\nnot  talking  of  a hypothetical situation.  These  are  real\r\n\r\npeople  who  are going through a tremendous global revolution\r\n\r\nin  values.   You open up Fortune magazine, what  is  it  all\r\n\r\nabout?  They also have their list of billionaires.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, if I were a young man of 35 or even 45, I will\r\n\r\npause and ask myself, \"Why not? Is it so difficult?  Somebody\r\n\r\nelse  can do this job.\"  But the plain fact is that very  few\r\n\r\npeople  can  do  this  job.  I was explaining  to  the  party\r\n\r\nsecretary  of  Shenzhen when it was getting  started  in  the\r\n\r\n1980s, I said, \"You have to be satisfied to run a system that\r\n\r\nenables  many  millionaires to flourish, and you  are  not  a\r\n\r\nmillionaire.   And if you can do that, then you can  succeed.\r\n\r\nBut  if you see the millions being made and you want to  join\r\n\r\nin  those  millions,  you will fail. The  whole  system  will\r\n\r\ncollapse.\"   That  is  the  problem.   Look  around  and  ask\r\n\r\nyourself: why has it failed?  Because your authority to  sign\r\n\r\nor not to sign a licence decides whether you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  make him a millionaire or a billionaire or not, so  why\r\n\r\nnot   make  yourself  one  incidentally?   It  is  not   very\r\n\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, like America, people take on a job\r\n\r\nfor a short period and then they go out to the private sector\r\n\r\n- where having served their country is a valuable addition to\r\n\r\ntheir  bio-data,  apart from the important  connections  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  have.   You  look at one of the  most  successful\r\n\r\nAmerican  treasury  secretaries since World  War  II,  Robert\r\n\r\nRubin  - (Goldman Sachs, chairman) gave it up.  For six years\r\n\r\nthe  market knew that they had a professional and a very able\r\n\r\nprofessional, and they had confidence in him.   The  boom  in\r\n\r\nthe Clinton years is partly due to him and to Alan Greenspan,\r\n\r\nchairman of the Fed.  But he wanted to leave after the  first\r\n\r\nterm.   He  was persuaded to stay on.  He stayed  on  another\r\n\r\n11/2 years and now he is co-chairman of the Citigroup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out how long it takes to get an MP to learn\r\n\r\nto  be  a minister and have the public recognise him as such,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  he  is  not a natural  crowd  puller  or  a\r\n\r\nmobiliser.   There are two kinds of ministers in Singapore  - the  doer  and the mobiliser. The ideal is to be able  to  do\r\n\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mah Bow Tan contested against Chiam See Tong in\r\n\r\nPotong  Pasir,  you would not believe it, in 1980,  he  lost.\r\n\r\nBecause you stand in a crowd, watch two chaps performing, and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"I  think  this chap looks reasonable.  He  is  bright,\r\n\r\nenergetic,\"  and so they voted for him.  But  I  happened  to\r\n\r\nknow  Mah  Bow  Tan  and I knew his career.   He  had  worked\r\n\r\nclosely  with me when we tried to help the Singapore  Monitor\r\n\r\nget  started to compete against the Straits Times and halfway\r\n\r\nthrough he told me, \"Look, we can't.  It will lose because of\r\n\r\nthe grip of the Straits Times on all sources of news. They've\r\n\r\nbought  out  all the agencies, all the cartoons,  everything.\r\n\r\nYou   cannot  beat  them.\"   I  decided  that  this  man  has\r\n\r\njudgement.  So we fielded him in 1984 and only after  another\r\n\r\n10  years,  now  16  years,  that  people  have  a  different\r\n\r\nimpression  of  him.  They  know that  he  is  competent  and\r\n\r\neffective.  Look at the ministries that he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  handled.   So the prime minister now gives him  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, you take Teo Chee Hean. He stood in the by-election in Marine Parade in 1992 - tall, lean, lanky, a bit\r\n\r\ngawky - as against Dr Chee Soon Juan, voluble, exuberant.  If\r\n\r\nit was not a GRC, one-to-one, he may well have lost.  Because\r\n\r\nwhat  was the basis for judging?  A short note about  his  CV\r\n\r\nand you see the physical person and you judge him on what  he\r\n\r\nsays  at  a  few  rallies.  But eight years later,  from  the\r\n\r\nthings he has done, from the difficult problems he is setting\r\n\r\nout  to  solve, people recognise that this is a thinking  man\r\n\r\nand  a  very serious man who gets things done and he is going\r\n\r\nto  get the schools up to a different level, and the teachers\r\n\r\ntoo.  They have seen the quality in the man, the depth of his\r\n\r\ncommitment and that he can deliver.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take Lim Boon Heng, a Colombo Plan scholar, did\r\n\r\nnaval architecture in the University of Newcastle.  He worked\r\n\r\nin NOL in 1971 but because Goh Chok Tong had worked with him,\r\n\r\nhe  knew  that  this man can do things. He persuaded  him  to\r\n\r\nstand  for election as MP in 1980, then sent him to  NTUC  to\r\n\r\nwork with the secretary-general, Ong Teng Cheong. The NTUC is\r\n\r\nnot  a  glamour  sector.  No great addition to your  bio-data\r\n\r\nthat will get you into a higher job.  Maybe you can become  a\r\n\r\nhuman resource or a trade union contact man.  But from a good\r\n\r\ngovernment point of view, NTUC is absolutely crucial  because\r\n\r\nyour  policies have got to be sensitive to the large mass  of\r\n\r\nthe  semi-skilled and the unskilled and somehow you  must  be\r\n\r\nable  to craft your solutions so that they also have a  place\r\n\r\nunder  the  sun.  Quietly, he built  up  rapport  with  union\r\n\r\nleaders  and  workers  and  won  their  confidence   by   his\r\n\r\nsincerity.   Eleven years later, in 1991,  he  became  senior\r\n\r\nminister  of  state  for  trade and  industry,  to  test  his\r\n\r\ndecision-making power as an administrator. Then in  1993,  he\r\n\r\nwent  back to NTUC as secretary-general and minister  without\r\n\r\nportfolio in the PMO.  When a difficult measure like  cutting\r\n\r\nthe CPF by 10% was necessary two years ago, he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplayed  a major part in persuading workers and union  leaders\r\n\r\nto agree to this rational but emotionally very difficult cut.\r\n\r\nThe point I want to make simply is this.  It takes many years\r\n\r\nof  quiet work to build up relationships and establish trust.\r\n\r\nThose in the NTUC doing this job, they are a crucial part  of\r\n\r\ngood government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, one flaw of the democratic system is\r\n\r\nthat  voters  do  not have a proper assessment  of  the  real\r\n\r\nperson  behind  a first-time candidate - his  character,  his\r\n\r\nsteadfastness, his trustworthiness. They only know him  after\r\n\r\nseveral years and it is true of ministers, of the Speaker and\r\n\r\nof  every MP, including the opposition.  Both Chiam See  Tong\r\n\r\nand  Low  Thia  Khiang  have  been re-elected  because  their\r\n\r\nelectorate  has  seen them as consistent and steady  and  are\r\n\r\nprepared to continue to have them represent them.  Hence,  it\r\n\r\nis  important that MPs are suitably remunerated.  People need\r\n\r\ntime  to  gauge and assess who has the qualities best  suited\r\n\r\nfor  what  jobs that can make Singapore grow and thrive.  The\r\n\r\ndanger  for  Singapore is one of sudden change, a new  school\r\n\r\nterm  with new pupils, new prefects, new head prefect, and  a\r\n\r\nnew school principal.  Many things can go awry.  And I cannot\r\n\r\nover-emphasise the importance of continuity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtuous cycle that we have established, which the\r\n\r\nprime minister spoke about earlier today, is a cycle of  good\r\n\r\ngovernment  making  for  high  growth  and  social  progress,\r\n\r\nleading to the re-election of good government, leading to the\r\n\r\nability to renew that good government by recruiting more good\r\n\r\nmen to continue the work.  That cycle could be broken.  If it\r\n\r\ndoes,  it  will probably never be re-established.   You  just\r\n\r\nlook  at the travail of the LDP in Japan.  After 40 years  in\r\n\r\noffice,   in  the  last  decade,  they  have  suffered   from\r\n\r\ndecreasing voter support.  One factor which will help prevent\r\n\r\nthat  happening  in  Singapore is to have  elections  without\r\n\r\nmoney  politics - no money to win elections,  even  to  fight\r\n\r\nelections,   and   to   pay  ministers,   judges,   permanent\r\n\r\nsecretaries,  CEOs  of  companies  and  all  those   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  two-thirds of the market rate for the  job.   The\r\n\r\nissue is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsimple one, whether the public sector should adopt the market\r\n\r\nrate.   Big  corporations give their top CEO  share  options,\r\n\r\nworth  multi-millions, to attract the best.  When they  fail,\r\n\r\nthey are out.  Proctor & Gamble had two bad quarters, and the\r\n\r\nCEO resigned, and they looked for another one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has raised Singapore's per capita GDP\r\n\r\nfrom  third  world to first world levels.  1959, per  capita,\r\n\r\n$1,300, when I first took office.  1990, 30 years later  when\r\n\r\nI stepped down, $22,000, from $1,300.  Ten years later, after\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister Goh took over, it is now $37,000.  Sit  down,\r\n\r\nask  yourself,  was  that doing what comes  naturally?   What\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  done to achieve that?  A working system,  good\r\n\r\npolicies, anticipating problems before they hit you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question really is: can we afford not to increase\r\n\r\nthe $28 million paid to office holders last year by a further\r\n\r\n$6  million, which the revisions cost?  See it in  proportion\r\n\r\nto what is at stake.  Pay the judges what we used to pay them\r\n\r\nand  ask  whether Chief Justice Yong could have done what  he\r\n\r\nhas  done in the last 10 years.  I knew the problems with the\r\n\r\nBar  and  with the courts.  Work was piling up.  The  problem\r\n\r\ncould  not be solved.  It could only be solved by a  complete\r\n\r\nchange of system.  I looked for a man who was a lawyer,  whom\r\n\r\nI  have  known since we were in university together, who  had\r\n\r\ngone  into private practice and become a top banker.  I asked\r\n\r\nhim  to take on this job.  He has a real grasp of the outside\r\n\r\nworld.  I gave him the support.  I said, \"Change it,\" and  he\r\n\r\nhas.  And in 10 years, it is a totally different judiciary, a\r\n\r\ntotally  different  system,  because  he  has  been  able  to\r\n\r\npersuade  good  men  to take up these jobs.   The  sum  total\r\n\r\nincrease which we are talking about is $400 million  a  year,\r\n\r\nand they involve billions in the GDP every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, do not believe that we have escaped the\r\n\r\nproblems  that have plagued our neighbours and the  region  - KKN for corruption, collusion and nepotism, which have caused\r\n\r\nso much damage.  If we believe that we are immune from it, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  really  risking our future.  It is a world-wide  disease\r\n\r\nand  especially endemic in Asia, and we can be easily striken\r\n\r\nby it.  Only constant vigilance has kept it down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our market-based pay and allowances will give no excuse\r\n\r\nfor any slippage, and it is the duty of all of us  -  MPs  of\r\n\r\nall  parties and ministers  -  to be alert, to make sure that\r\n\r\nno  KKN incidents take place without proper investigation and\r\n\r\npunishment,  and  to  set  the example  by  maintaining  high\r\n\r\nstandards  in  protecting the integrity of our  institutions.\r\n\r\nAnd  you need two things for Singapore's continued well-being\r\n\r\n- strong institutions and good men to run them.  [Applause].\r\n\r\n<br>4.50 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Sir, for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure what I can contribute after all that has\r\n\r\nbeen  said, especially after the last speaker.  Let me  start\r\n\r\nby saying that Nominated Members of Parliament such as myself\r\n\r\ndo  not  enjoy  the same allowances as the  elected  MPs,  as\r\n\r\nreflected in Annex 3 circulated by DPM Lee.  I say  this  not\r\n\r\nto  begrudge them or to claim any moral high ground.  I  only\r\n\r\nsay  that so that all my friends would not try to claim lunch\r\n\r\nfrom me next week!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPM's statement covers three main issues - new\r\n\r\napproaches  for civil service leadership, the  civil  service\r\n\r\nsalaries as a whole and, third, and most controversially, the\r\n\r\nsalary  increases  for senior civil servants  and  Government\r\n\r\nappointments.  These are linked but quite different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make just some short points on the first and\r\n\r\nsecond   issues   before  moving  to  the  third   and   more\r\n\r\ncontroversial.   I  would say that this is a  very  difficult\r\n\r\ndebate  to  join, in terms of how it is structured.   On  one\r\n\r\nhand,  clearly in this House, we have emphasised  the  market\r\n\r\nand  logic.   The  emphasis has been on  the  need  for  good\r\n\r\ngovernment, ie, this Government which is trusted and has done\r\n\r\nwell.  And it is this Government that is asking the public to\r\n\r\nbelieve in the steps that it is taking.  What do we have,  on\r\n\r\nthe other hand?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As characterised in this House, we seem to have the\r\n\r\npolitics  of  envy  and emotion, and the danger  of  bad  and\r\n\r\ncorrupt  government.  My argument is that there is,  on  this\r\n\r\nother hand, something more than this, and that we may need to\r\n\r\nconsider.    The  words  \"equity\",  \"idealisim\"  and   \"moral\r\n\r\nleadership\"  have been far less prevalent in this  debate  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  I think all of us would say that maybe this  is\r\n\r\naccepted, understood, as part of the background, but I  think\r\n\r\nthey bear re-emphasis.  Of course, everyone will agree that a\r\n\r\ngood  living  wage,  and reward are necessary  for  political\r\n\r\nleadership.  But very few people in this House have spoken of\r\n\r\nthe  reward  of other less tangible things.  When the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister was speaking on the founding generation, he made  it\r\n\r\nvery clear that they were special, and that events of history\r\n\r\nhad  brought them together.  He also made it very clear  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  human enough to have some tinge of  envy  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  salaries.  But I would say to them also that because\r\n\r\nthey  were participants in that great history, they have  and\r\n\r\ndeserve  our respect in a very deep way, and that is  what  I\r\n\r\nmean by the reward of less tangible things, of being able  to\r\n\r\nsay  to  their  children that \"I did this for  you  and  your\r\n\r\ngeneration, and your children's generation.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am concerned about in bringing this issue\r\n\r\nup,  particularly the  rewards for the politicians, is of the\r\n\r\nunintended  consequences of debating  this  case  in  a  very\r\n\r\npublic,  rigorous way.  We are in danger of over arguing  the\r\n\r\ncase,  I  believe, that if we do not agree  to  these  salary\r\n\r\nrevisions, then everything we do will fail.  I think that  is\r\n\r\na  dangerous  argument.  And, therefore, I was glad  to  hear\r\n\r\nearlier  today Prime Minister Goh's assurance  of  the  other\r\n\r\nfive  Cs,  not  the typical 5 Cs of society,  of  the  market\r\n\r\nplace,  but these other 5 Cs  -  qualities such as  character\r\n\r\nand compassion  -  that he spoke so well about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to acknowledge therefore the good that our\r\n\r\nGovernment  has done and the need for future good government.\r\n\r\nBut I want to question what are the factors\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  made it good  -  only money or is there something more?\r\n\r\nIn  fact, this recognition of a good government is one of  my\r\n\r\nstarting  points, because I think one of the  questions  that\r\n\r\nhas  not been asked so far is a very basic one.  What is  the\r\n\r\nmischief that we are seeking to avoid?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the pay increase for the majority of\r\n\r\ncivil  servants, which has been less controversial.  But  the\r\n\r\npay  increase  is nevertheless substantial.   In  moving  it,\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister Lee has assured the  House  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is trying to follow the market, but not  lead  it.\r\n\r\nI understand that some people in the private sector have some\r\n\r\nreservations.  They think that the wage hikes will  undermine\r\n\r\nsome   of  the  cost-cutting  measures  we  took  to  enhance\r\n\r\nSingapore's  competitiveness last year  and,  secondly,  that\r\n\r\nthey may potentially spark a bidding war for talent.  In this\r\n\r\ncontext,  I  would ask the Deputy Prime Minister  to  address\r\n\r\nthese concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest a new mechanism. In\r\n\r\nfuture,  when Government decides to go well beyond  what  the\r\n\r\nNWC  recommends,  as in this case, these further  adjustments\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  the subject of some consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  In that sense, it is  NWC  plus.   The  NWC\r\n\r\ntripartite  system is a model that has served for  the  basic\r\n\r\nwage  increases,  and  I do not see  why  it  should  not  be\r\n\r\nreasonably  successful  in  negotiating  even  these  further\r\n\r\nefforts to catch up with the market.  Because the Government,\r\n\r\nput  together, is Singapore's largest employer, and  what  it\r\n\r\ndoes, does matter to the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying this, I want to emphasise that I do believe\r\n\r\nthat  some turnover in the civil service is not a bad  thing.\r\n\r\nThere is no harm in having some percentage of people transfer\r\n\r\nfrom  the  public sector to the private sector and,  in  this\r\n\r\nway,  learn how these two different entities work and perhaps\r\n\r\nlink  them better.  There is a certain dynamism in this,   to\r\n\r\ncreate  better links and understanding between  the  sectors.\r\n\r\nIn that sense, I am urging that the Government take a view of\r\n\r\nacceptable levels of turnover and monitor trends\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagainst  this before acting.  This is necessary for the  bulk\r\n\r\nof the civil service, but it is especially true for the elite\r\n\r\nAdministrative Service.  And with that, let  me  turn  to  my\r\n\r\nsecond point of the measures concerning this elite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that by looking at turnover, we will\r\n\r\navoid  the possibility of over reacting, because one  or  two\r\n\r\nelite  civil  servants leave.  Allow me to cite some  figures\r\n\r\npublished in the Straits Times on Thursday, 29th June, in the\r\n\r\narticle \"Fall in Number of People who Quit Jobs\".  The report\r\n\r\ncites  research  by  the  Manpower  Research  and  Statistics\r\n\r\nDepartment.  It says that the rate of labour turnover has, in\r\n\r\nfact,  declined in Singapore, following from 4.4% in 1990  to\r\n\r\n2.1% in 1998, and then 2.2% last year.  Of course, these last\r\n\r\ntwo were bad years, and people tend not to move in bad years.\r\n\r\nIn  that  sense, I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister,  in\r\n\r\nmoving  these large financial measures to catch up,  what  is\r\n\r\nthe  turnover  for  the civil service as  a  whole,  and  key\r\n\r\nsections  of the civil service.  Why are we needing  to  take\r\n\r\ncare of the turnover problem?  Is there a problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report I cite also mentions that professionals,\r\n\r\nmanagers and others at the higher end of the workforce  tend,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  to have the lowest resignation rate  -  1.6%.   In\r\n\r\nputting  these questions to the Government, I  also  want  to\r\n\r\nemphasise that there is the question of whether there is some\r\n\r\nsort of pent-up departure, in the sense that people have  not\r\n\r\nleft  as normal in the last two years.  There has been  under\r\n\r\nreporting   - 2.1%-2.2%  -   and therefore there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsurge  quite naturally this year, and then we may again level\r\n\r\noff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second set of questions I have for the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  relates to what are the reasons that civil servants\r\n\r\ncite  for  leaving,  assuming they have  this  kind  of  exit\r\n\r\ninterview  that  asks such questions.   I  ask  this  because\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister Lee's statement itself recognises  that\r\n\r\npay  alone will not keep people in their jobs.  The prospects\r\n\r\nof  the new economy are not just financial, but the sense  of\r\n\r\npioneering, adventure and ownership.  If\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso,  then raising pay by itself may not be the right  answer.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if we over argue this and over emphasise this, we may\r\n\r\nbe  misleading ourselves.  There can be pay differences  that\r\n\r\ndo  not  lead  to  turnover or there can  be  high  rates  of\r\n\r\nturnover  even  if there is good pay.  Other factors  clearly\r\n\r\ncome  into play  -  factors that money itself cannot address.\r\n\r\nI believe there are some people who have good reasons to want\r\n\r\nto  stay  in the civil service to contribute, even  if  their\r\n\r\npay,  whilst reasonably good, is not the best in the  market.\r\n\r\nI hope there are such people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, I actually welcome DPM's other point of\r\n\r\nhis  statement about the public sector leadership in allowing\r\n\r\nmore mobility, this flow of people, by requiring fixed tenure\r\n\r\nof  appointments rather than making Permanent Secretaries too\r\n\r\npermanent.  This change in permanence is a good one.   But  I\r\n\r\nwill put it to Members that in a sense it actually encourages\r\n\r\nturnover,  perhaps  of a healthy type.  Nevertheless,  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething  we need to consider.  I move to think about  these\r\n\r\nissues   because  of  some  recent  publicity   regarding   a\r\n\r\nparticular civil servant, Dr Finian Tan.  From what I read in\r\n\r\nthe papers, Dr Finian Tan was one of the very few, if not the\r\n\r\nonly  private  sector top performer, to respond  to  the  pay\r\n\r\nincreases  and the call of Government to join  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  leadership.  He did well serving as Deputy Secretary\r\n\r\nat  the  Ministry  of Trade and Industry, going  through  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service training, but now has recently left.   He  has\r\n\r\ngot better pay.  But from what I read again, it is not merely\r\n\r\nthe pay that drives his departure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without over focusing on this one individual, this case\r\n\r\nraises certain questions.  Why is it, despite increasing  our\r\n\r\npay,  the  Government  still faces difficulty  in  recruiting\r\n\r\npeople to the top of the civil service and of retaining  them\r\n\r\nthereafter?   The same questions apply in that sense  to  the\r\n\r\npolitical  leadership because we have not, despite these  pay\r\n\r\nrevisions,  recruited very widely from  the  private  sector.\r\n\r\nThe   new  members  of  Cabinet  have  come  much  more  from\r\n\r\ntraditional sources of the civil service and statutory bodies\r\n\r\nand the ranks of the scholars.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then turn to the last point and the most\r\n\r\ncontroversial.   I  think it is understood that  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwant  a Government of good quality.  But quality is not  all.\r\n\r\nCost  is  also a question of sensitivity and some  degree  of\r\n\r\nsubjectivity.   The  very fact that  we  are  in  this  House\r\n\r\ndebating how the formula should be re-worked recognises this.\r\n\r\nThe  very fact that for the two years of the crisis there was\r\n\r\na  freeze  recognises the sensitivity.  So, are  the  changes\r\n\r\nthat are being suggested enough?  In some ways, I am for  the\r\n\r\nchanges because they actually try to make it a fairer system,\r\n\r\n48 people rather than 24, the median rather than the average.\r\n\r\nBut  is  that enough of a change?  Again, I have to  ask  the\r\n\r\nquestion: what is the mischief?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are arguing today in a new context. Five\r\n\r\nyears  ago  when  we  argued  the principle  of  benchmarking\r\n\r\nsalaries,  we had the assumption that the whole  economy  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  go  up,  that  everyone would  benefit  from  good\r\n\r\nGovernment and what Singapore will deliver for them.  When we\r\n\r\ntalked  about  this again in the crisis years,  we  all  felt\r\n\r\naffected.  Of course, looking back now, we know that those in\r\n\r\nthe  very top still prospered.  But the general sentiment was\r\n\r\nthat we were in it together as one nation, one society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context today, as emphasised by many speakers,\r\n\r\nglobalisation will  actually increase the differences between\r\n\r\nthe  top,  the  bottom, the top and the middle,  and  even  a\r\n\r\nhandful  of the very top, from the next few in the 1%.   This\r\n\r\nnew  context  brings  out not just the  market  forces  which\r\n\r\neveryone  has emphasised, but the question the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  the  Senior  Minister put to us: what  do  we  do  as  a\r\n\r\nsociety?   Can  we keep diverging as a society?   The  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister who spoke before me said no.  We can hope there must\r\n\r\nbe  some balancing point.  He pointed to global forces  which\r\n\r\nthen  speak out against this continuing divergence.  In  this\r\n\r\ncontext,  we  have to ask ourselves whether this  new  policy\r\n\r\nwill  help or hurt us.  This is why the public and this House\r\n\r\nhave been engaged in debate about the true level of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe bottom 10% in Singapore, whether it is $133 per month  or\r\n\r\n$530 per month, if we take out the jobless people.  Are those\r\n\r\nstill  too  low?  We have, in this context, to ask  ourselves\r\n\r\nwhether this new formula is really going to continue to  help\r\n\r\nbind  the  society  together in a deeper  way.   I  emphasise\r\n\r\n\"deeper\"  because the forces of globalisation are  likely  to\r\n\r\nget stronger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that many people are concerned that linking the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  market  is  imperfect.   We  are  told  that\r\n\r\nMinisters  are not priests. Fair enough.  Another analogy  is\r\n\r\nlike  doctors.   We  respect that doctors must  earn  a  good\r\n\r\nliving.  In Singapore, they do.  But if your doctor tells you\r\n\r\nthat  he is interested in your fees and not your health,  you\r\n\r\nknow you are in trouble.  You want to change your doctor.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  profession I am from, lawyers, is the reverse  of\r\n\r\nthis  joke.   Everyone thinks that lawyers  are  in  for  the\r\n\r\nmoney,  which is why there are all these jokes about  lawyers\r\n\r\nand sharks, paying each other mutual professional respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the political dimension should be recognised and\r\n\r\nhandled,  not  just  with  appeals  to  logic  but  with  due\r\n\r\nrecognition for the values of society, of compassion, equity,\r\n\r\nif  not,  the sterile hand of equality.  If other governments\r\n\r\npay  too low, or are corrupt, they provide us with very  easy\r\n\r\ntargets to say that what we are doing is exactly correct.  It\r\n\r\nis  true that others do not have the right approach.   If  we\r\n\r\nlook at the US, I believe the salary of the President has not\r\n\r\nbeen  adjusted  for about 17 or so years.   That  is  clearly\r\n\r\nwrong.   But  we do not need to jump so fast to the  reverse.\r\n\r\nThey need not be adjusted automatically every year based on a\r\n\r\nvery  small  number  of  top performers  when  the  world  is\r\n\r\nglobalising and differences are accelerating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have good Government. We need to have\r\n\r\ncompetent bureaucracy.  A part of that is to have very strong\r\n\r\nlinks  to the median of people and even the bottom of people.\r\n\r\nI  would  therefore urge the Government to consider at  least\r\n\r\none proposal.  This is that the benchmark should no longer be\r\n\r\nwith those at the very top, whether it is 24 or 48, but aimed\r\n\r\nto  be  with the median.  In many statistics, one can analyse\r\n\r\ncompanies based on how\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmuch  the  CEO  is  paid as compared to  the  bottom  worker.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is a multiple of 20, 30, 40 or more.   That,  in\r\n\r\nsome   ways,  will  be  more  comfortable  for  me  and  some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  that Ministers should receive a  good  salary,\r\n\r\none  that  puts him above the temptations of corruption,  one\r\n\r\nthat  allows him to worry about the affairs of state  without\r\n\r\nworrying  about their own pockets, but perhaps  one  that  is\r\n\r\npegged  as  a  high  multiple of the median.   This  is  more\r\n\r\ncomfortable  because this would actually create  the  linkage\r\n\r\nbetween  their performance in bringing everyone  up  and  not\r\n\r\nallowing  just  the few top people to fly ahead  of  everyone\r\n\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government will not consider this for the base\r\n\r\nsalary  of  the  top political leadership,  I  urge  them  to\r\n\r\nconsider  it  for the bonuses.  As proposed, the bonuses  are\r\n\r\npegged to GDP and GDP, as we know, is too raw, too global,  a\r\n\r\nfigure.  We need to target the bottom. We need to target  the\r\n\r\nmedian.   We need political leaders who constantly  emphasise\r\n\r\ntheir  links  in both pocket, in compassion, and  where  they\r\n\r\nstand  with  these  people  at  the  bottom  and  middle   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, Singaporeans take\r\n\r\npride  that we have a Government that is efficient,  corrupt-free   and,   more  importantly,  one  that  is  far-sighted.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  any  country where salaries of politicians  are\r\n\r\nraised  for  discussion, it stirs emotion  and  public  talk.\r\n\r\nHence,  it  comes  as no surprise that the  topic  of  salary\r\n\r\nrevision  has become public topic today.  I am glad that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in  a  true,  open and transparent  manner,  has\r\n\r\nchosen  to table these salary revisions despite it being  not\r\n\r\nthe best of times to do so, especially when we are recovering\r\n\r\nfrom  a recession.  Sir, I commend the Government for tabling\r\n\r\nthese salary revisions timely for public scrutiny and debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first comment on the salaries of the\r\n\r\nMinisters.   Few  can deny that our Prime  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  are a fine lot.  They sacrifice much  to  take  on\r\n\r\npolitical appointments.  They sacrifice career certainty  for\r\n\r\npolitical uncertainty.  They sacrifice privacy for  a  regime\r\n\r\nof taxing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment  and community work.  Many also sacrifice  private\r\n\r\nand  family  life  for  the  country.   Sir,  they  manage  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  whose  foreign reserves are in the  billions,  an\r\n\r\neconomy that is vulnerable and they are also responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe well-being of three million Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the critical issue is whether our Ministers focus\r\n\r\non running the country or constantly worry how they will meet\r\n\r\nthe  present and future needs of their families.   If we want\r\n\r\nthe  best, let us then pay the best and expect the best  from\r\n\r\nthem.  That the ruling party sets very high standards for the\r\n\r\nrecruitment  of Ministers is there for public scrutiny.   Our\r\n\r\nMinisters are questioned in Parliament, by the media and even\r\n\r\nin international forums.  Their impressive knowledge, thought\r\n\r\nprocess and management skills are there for everyone  to  see\r\n\r\nand  to  scrutinise.  Even critics are known to have conceded\r\n\r\ndue credit to our Ministers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original benchmark formula adopted in 1994 was not\r\n\r\nthe best as is recognised by the further refinement announced\r\n\r\nrecently.  But it has to be so as the compensation package in\r\n\r\nthe  employment  market is one that is never  static.   Stock\r\n\r\noptions  were something new here in 1994.  But now these  are\r\n\r\nbecoming  basic  in many new companies, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nemerging  new economy companies.  Change is the only constant\r\n\r\nthing  in the new economy, and I am glad that this Government\r\n\r\nis  tackling the issue of compensating public employees  head\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking to some Singaporeans yesterday, I felt that many\r\n\r\ndo not really understand the details announced.  To many what\r\n\r\nmattered  was that the increase was substantial.   The  usual\r\n\r\ncriticisms were raised.  I thought I would raise them here so\r\n\r\nthat they can be discussed openly in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these have already been highlighted by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Some felt that political office is an ethical  and\r\n\r\nmoral  one  and not one that is purely pecuniary based.  They\r\n\r\nfelt  higher  salaries will translate to  cynicism  and  less\r\n\r\nrespect for the Ministers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some stated that the benchmark formula used is not\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of  the  pay of employees  but  are  that  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs who make big bucks not due to hard work but due\r\n\r\nto connections, guanxi, high risks and sheer luck.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some also felt that Ministers should set the right\r\n\r\nexample by withholding salary increases in an economy that is\r\n\r\nstill recovering.  Their point simply was that the timing was\r\n\r\ninappropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another view was that the new pay packet was one drafted\r\n\r\nby  civil  servants for civil servants and one that  was  not\r\n\r\nsubject to external evaluation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some even expressed the view that the new increases will\r\n\r\ntrigger a wage spiral in the economy as it becomes a case  of\r\n\r\nmany chasing fewer job candidates in the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what became clear to me after yesterday's feedback\r\n\r\nwas  that there are two groups of people.  One group is those\r\n\r\nwhom  I  would call the \"I know\" group and the other  the  \"I\r\n\r\nknow not\" group.  Those whom I refer to as \"I know\" group are\r\n\r\nthe  people who are very familiar as to what is happening  in\r\n\r\nthe  job  market,  particularly for the  top  talent  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy  and they know that it is very difficult to get  good\r\n\r\ntalent even when you pay high price.  The other group which I\r\n\r\ncall  the  \"I know not\" group is the group that has basically\r\n\r\nno knowledge as to what is happening in the top talent market\r\n\r\nand  they do not know how much it takes to pay them  and  how\r\n\r\ndifficult  it  is  to recruit top talent.   What  has  become\r\n\r\nclear,  even  when listening to the debate  that  took  place\r\n\r\ntoday, is that even some MPs are not clear as to how tough it\r\n\r\nis  to get good talent in the market. Some MPs have expressed\r\n\r\nthe  view,  particularly the Members  for  Potong  Pasir  and\r\n\r\nHougang,   that  our  leaders'  salaries,  particularly   the\r\n\r\nMinisters' salaries, be pegged to a reasonable level and they\r\n\r\ncompare to the salary of about $50,000 or the salary  of  the\r\n\r\nUS President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam, in his address, stated that the US\r\n\r\nPresident's salary was increased\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  about US$200,000 to US$400,000 which works out to about\r\n\r\nS$630,000.   But when the pay of the US President was  raised\r\n\r\nin  1998,  one  of the reports indicated that  the  President\r\n\r\nhimself was embarrassed.  However, the reality was that  they\r\n\r\nhad  to increase his salary because the US President's salary\r\n\r\nformed  the benchmark for the whole US administration.   Only\r\n\r\nwhen they increased the salary of the US President could they\r\n\r\nthen increase the salary for the whole administration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, when we benchmark the pay of the Ministers,\r\n\r\nwe  are not only talking about the pay for the Ministers, but\r\n\r\nwe  are  also  talking  about the pay  for  the  whole  civil\r\n\r\nservice.   Although we are asking our Ministers to  sacrifice\r\n\r\nand  forgo  salary increases, the reality is that below  them\r\n\r\nthere  is  a big group of civil servants who are all  waiting\r\n\r\nfor their pay increases and will constantly compare with what\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector is paying and what is the attraction  in\r\n\r\nthe private sector.  Although we are calling for Ministers to\r\n\r\nrestrain  pay  increases in the course  of  the  debate,  the\r\n\r\nreality  is  that we can never keep the pay of the  Ministers\r\n\r\nlow  and yet try to keep our civil servants by keeping  their\r\n\r\npay  high.   We have to ensure that the whole public  sector,\r\n\r\nwhich  includes the Ministers, is always paid  at  the  level\r\n\r\nwith  what  the  private sector is able to  afford  and  also\r\n\r\nattract the same talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nevertheless, it is essential that the Government\r\n\r\ncontinually explains the transparency of our Ministers'  pay.\r\n\r\nLet  me  highlight many other things that the public  is  not\r\n\r\naware.  Not many are aware that our Ministers' pay packet  is\r\n\r\na  whole package and there are no hidden benefits.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  free  housing, no free cars for private use, no servants'\r\n\r\nallowance, or paid holidays for them or their family,  as  it\r\n\r\nis like in many other countries.  Even the US President's pay\r\n\r\nis  not merely what he gets in terms of the US$400,000 but he\r\n\r\nenjoys many other perks, including a special jet for himself.\r\n\r\nSo there are many other perks which if one packages it in,  I\r\n\r\nam quite sure it well exceeds what our Prime Minister or many\r\n\r\nof our Ministers earn, and that is something that was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmissing,  I  thought, in the debate that took place  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, not many are also aware that not all\r\n\r\nMinisters are paid the same salary and bonuses but a range of\r\n\r\nsalaries   and   bonuses  according  to  appointments   held,\r\n\r\nperformance and other yardsticks, as also similarly indicated\r\n\r\nby the handout by the Prime Minister in respect of bonuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many also remember that Ministers, just like all big\r\n\r\nincome  earners, also pay a large income tax which  basically\r\n\r\ncreams off 26% of their income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many also remember that Ministers are not permanent\r\n\r\ntenure holders but individuals whose tenure is decided by the\r\n\r\npeople once in five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many also remember that they manage an economy that\r\n\r\nhas a GDP of $154 billion as of 1999 and a foreign reserve of\r\n\r\nabout $128 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many also remember that we hold our Ministers\r\n\r\nresponsible  when anything goes wrong in the country.   If  I\r\n\r\nremember  what  happened in 1997, everyone, particularly  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  was  asking what were our leaders doing  about  the\r\n\r\nrecession and their loss of jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, not many also remember that we hold our\r\n\r\nMinisters responsible when anything else goes wrong  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  Literally put, Singaporeans expect our Ministers to\r\n\r\nbe \"Superman\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call is: let us then pay them what they are worth and\r\n\r\nwhat they deserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these criticisms at home by Singaporeans, many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  I  met overseas usually take pride  in  stating\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  has a corrupt free environment  because  our\r\n\r\nMinisters and public sector employees are well paid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having added the above, there are two important\r\n\r\nissues that I would like the DPM to address, and these are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) whether our well-paid Ministers will continue to\r\n\r\nshare   the   aspirations  and  concerns  of   the   ordinary\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparticularly  the low-income groups and the disadvantaged  in\r\n\r\nSingapore; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) whether the new salary structure is adequate to\r\n\r\nattract  and retain the best in Singapore to become Ministers\r\n\r\nand political appointment holders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the civil servants' pay\r\n\r\nrevision.   While I recognise the need for the Administrative\r\n\r\nService to continue to recruit and retain the best talent,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  the  best approach to ensure  that  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  remains the backbone of a good and clean government.\r\n\r\nI  am  convinced after my interaction with the Administrative\r\n\r\nService   officers  over  the  years  that  they   are   both\r\n\r\nhardworking, have great minds and that they are also creative\r\n\r\nand,  most  of all, have the interest of the State  in  their\r\n\r\nminds.   Some  are  at  times  mistaken  that  Administrative\r\n\r\nOfficers  have  a cushy job.  I thought I will  highlight  an\r\n\r\ninstance   so  that  we  recognise  the  heavy   burden   and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  that  some  of  our  Administrative  Officers\r\n\r\ncarry.  While serving on the Inter-Ministerial Committee  for\r\n\r\nthe  Ageing last year, I gave a tough assignment with a tight\r\n\r\nschedule  to  an  Administrative Officer supporting  my  sub-committee.  He produced the required work in 24 hours.   Sir,\r\n\r\nI  saw his very red and tired eyes the next day and knew that\r\n\r\nhe had worked overnight.  I asked him whether this was common\r\n\r\nto  him.   And he informed me that he provides administrative\r\n\r\nsupport  to four to five committees usually and this  was  on\r\n\r\ntop  of his regular job at the Ministry.  I highlighted  this\r\n\r\nto  show that we pay them well but we also expect and extract\r\n\r\na  lot  from them.  I am sure that such officers will  be  in\r\n\r\nhigh  demand in the private sector and employers will  pay  a\r\n\r\npremium  to recruit men of such quality.  The more  such  men\r\n\r\nare  lost  in the civil service, I think the bigger the  loss\r\n\r\nfor Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Government to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  career route to the Administrative Service continues  to\r\n\r\nbe  fair  for  entry  by  all  others  at  all  levels.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment must ensure that the Administrative Service is not\r\n\r\na closed club of Mandarins who only get admitted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough Government scholarships or academic excellence.   The\r\n\r\nmore it remains a closed club, it would invite resentment and\r\n\r\ncriticism.  It must continue to recruit the best talent based\r\n\r\non academic performance and proven performance.  It must also\r\n\r\ncontinue  to remain open to proven talent at all levels  both\r\n\r\nfrom  other  Government departments of the civil service  and\r\n\r\nalso from the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bigger concern is whether our new class of Mandarins\r\n\r\nwill  lose touch with the average Singaporeans.  With  better\r\n\r\npay  and  bonuses, many will climb the ranks of the  well-off\r\n\r\ntoo  quickly.   I  already sense that many  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nfeeling that our policy making top civil servants are  losing\r\n\r\ntouch  with the ordinary lives of Singaporeans.   How  do  we\r\n\r\nensure  that they remember that many Singaporeans are working\r\n\r\nclass  people  with real problems like balancing  their  bank\r\n\r\naccounts  every month?  How do we ensure that  they  keep  in\r\n\r\ntouch  with  the ordinary Singaporeans and not just  the  top\r\n\r\nincome groups?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, let me move on to the civil service general\r\n\r\nsalary  revision.  Sir, I support the rise in the  salary  of\r\n\r\nall civil servants as it will certainly go towards building a\r\n\r\nfirst class public service.  What I would like to ask the DPM\r\n\r\nis  whether exit interviews are conducted when civil servants\r\n\r\nresign  from  the civil service.  I am sure many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  be interested in knowing whether salary was the  reason\r\n\r\nfor  the  resignation  of the 284 senior  officers  from  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Officer  Service so far this year.  The  details,  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  available,  will  enable  Singaporeans  to  better\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  dollar pull of the private sector.   If  the\r\n\r\nreason  disclosed  is  family commitments,  pursuing  further\r\n\r\nstudies  or  other  reasons,  then  improving  the  financial\r\n\r\npackage  will  not address the problem.  I do hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will pay attention to the detailed reason for  the\r\n\r\nresignations and take the necessary action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the Government benchmarks the salary of the\r\n\r\npublic sector to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, the public also expects the tough  practices\r\n\r\nof  the private sector, such as in the area of human resource\r\n\r\nmanagement to be introduced into the public sector.   In  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, non-performers are given adequate notice  and\r\n\r\nshown  the  door.   Some have expressed concern  whether  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector will be able to fire non-performers.  It  will\r\n\r\nbe  no  use  if  \"non-performers\" are  transferred  to  other\r\n\r\ndepartments as such non-performers will only continue to \"non-perform\"  in the other departments within the public  sector.\r\n\r\nIs  the public sector really able to bite the bullet and fire\r\n\r\nthe non-performers at all levels of the public service?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, with better pay and bonuses, the public\r\n\r\nwill  expect  even higher standards of public  service.   The\r\n\r\npublic   will  become  less  tolerant  of  long   queues   at\r\n\r\npolyclinics, delays in replies and average service.  I  would\r\n\r\nask  the  DPM  how  the civil service will respond  to  these\r\n\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the public sector salary\r\n\r\nrevisions tabled by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not by\r\n\r\nchance  that the citizens of a small resource scarce  country\r\n\r\ncan  live peacefully, comfortably and ably, equipping  itself\r\n\r\nto face the challenges of the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not by chance that the Singapore economy made a V-shaped recovery from the recent stormy recession. It is not\r\n\r\nby  chance  that we can boast of Ministers of  integrity  and\r\n\r\ncompetence,   and   who   can  carry   themselves   well   in\r\n\r\ninternational forums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the preservation of a good, efficient and honest\r\n\r\nSingapore Government in the new economy is too crucial to  be\r\n\r\nleft  to chance.  We should put in place a mechanism to  help\r\n\r\nnurture  this.  It is on this basis that I rise to  speak  in\r\n\r\nsupport of DPM's ministerial statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make the following observations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, the Government's recognition of the impact\r\n\r\nof  the new economy on the Government and the aspirations  of\r\n\r\nyoung  officers is most timely.  What is the new economy?   I\r\n\r\ndo  not think that anyone can readily claim full knowledge of\r\n\r\nthe  new  economy, as the very nature of the new  economy  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  ever changing.  But one thing is certain.   The\r\n\r\nfast  pace changes will generate opportunities, such  as  the\r\n\r\nsprouting  of  dot-com  companies and life  sciences.   These\r\n\r\nopportunities  will  come  by swiftly.   Unless  we  position\r\n\r\nourselves well and ahead of time, we run the risk of  lagging\r\n\r\nbehind  in  the  competition.   Given  our  natural  resource\r\n\r\nconstraints,  Singapore  cannot  afford  any  slip   in   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  What this means is that we need to  have  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  that keeps pace with new trends and developments,\r\n\r\nhas  the  capacity and audacity to act promptly,  has  senior\r\n\r\ncivil servants who are willing to read up on life sciences in\r\n\r\norder  to  grow the Singapore economy.  In short, we  need  a\r\n\r\nvibrant civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The typical image of a civil service is that of an\r\n\r\nageing,  inflexible bureaucracy, a fogy old man  holding  the\r\n\r\nreins.   A typical image of the Singapore civil servant  must\r\n\r\nbe  one  with  the attitude of agent Ethan Hunt in  \"Mission:\r\n\r\nImpossible  2\", highly skilled, IT-savvy, high IQ,  high  EQ,\r\n\r\nexcellent  network  of  contacts and  gutsy  enough  to  make\r\n\r\ncalculated risks.  I believe that with the proposal set up in\r\n\r\nDPM's statement, we can take heart that we will have to place\r\n\r\na  continual leadership renewal process in the Government.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the DPM's proposal will help to  maintain  the\r\n\r\naverage age of senior civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By instituting a 10-year term, the Government will send\r\n\r\nthe right signal that it is no longer an iron rice bowl.   It\r\n\r\nwill  allow Administrative Officers who have completed a  10-year term to bow out gracefully, should they choose to do so.\r\n\r\nThis  in  turn  will  generate more opportunities  for  other\r\n\r\ncompetent Administrative Officers to rise to the top.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second observation concerns the review of the salary\r\n\r\nbenchmarks.  I believe it is a timely exercise and will  even\r\n\r\ngo  as  far  as to suggest that it should be conducted  every\r\n\r\nthree to five years.  So far, we have heard ample suggestions\r\n\r\non  how  to compute the Ministers' benchmark.  Which  is  the\r\n\r\nmost  acceptable  one?  In my opinion,  we  should  not  trip\r\n\r\nourselves  on  the technicalities of the benchmark  formulas.\r\n\r\nWe should not be overly concerned regarding whether we cut it\r\n\r\nfine enough.  Rather we should use the ranking as a sanity or\r\n\r\nreality  check  to ensure that the pegging is  at  the  right\r\n\r\nlevel.  For example, the Prime Minister is ranked 63rd  after\r\n\r\nthe  salary  revision.  Given his duties and responsibilities\r\n\r\nas  the Executive Chairman and CEO of Singapore Inc, he  must\r\n\r\nbe  grossly  underpaid in the marketplace.  Our  Minister  at\r\n\r\nStaff  Grade 1 is only ranked 367th, which again  is  grossly\r\n\r\ndisproportionate as compared to a person of the same  calibre\r\n\r\nin  the  marketplace.   And using the ranking  as  a  reality\r\n\r\ncheck,  I  believe  that the proposed benchmark  revision  is\r\n\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that we should not view the remuneration of\r\n\r\nour  Government and political leadership entirely  in  market\r\n\r\nterms.   I  suggest that we should not deceive ourselves  and\r\n\r\nsay  that all Government leaders be only driven by their self\r\n\r\nsacrificial public service spirit.  Let us be realistic about\r\n\r\nit.   Let us try to marry the need to be driven by the market\r\n\r\nand public spiritedness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of the worth of the Government and political\r\n\r\nleadership is in times of crisis.  Can they stand  the  test?\r\n\r\nThey  have  done  so  repeatedly, and  again  in  the  recent\r\n\r\neconomic  recession.   The  litmus  test  for  the  political\r\n\r\nleadership is in the elections, just like the private sector.\r\n\r\nIf we feel that the management team has done a lousy job, the\r\n\r\nshareholders  can  convene  to  dispose  them.   We  have  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly sophisticated electorate.  I believe  that  they\r\n\r\nunderstand the need for good government.  I believe that they\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  good things never come cheaply.   Likewise,\r\n\r\nthere is a cost to good leadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the DPM's ministerial statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Mr Speaker, the Senior Minister and\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  have just earlier shared  with  us  and\r\n\r\nreminded  us  of  the  calibre  of  our  Ministers  and   the\r\n\r\nachievements of the Government.  Actually, I think there  was\r\n\r\nno  real need for that because there is no question that  our\r\n\r\nMinisters are deserving and that the Government has done very\r\n\r\ngood  work.   The question that is troubling me  is  how  you\r\n\r\nreconcile the pragmatic approach that we will always take  in\r\n\r\nreducing  everything down to economic equations, on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand, with our call, on the other hand, to Singaporeans,  and\r\n\r\nto  younger Singaporeans especially, to be patriotic  and  to\r\n\r\nhave a love for their country and to have a commitment to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two days we have been debating and discussing the\r\n\r\nsalary  revisions that are just about to be made for our  top\r\n\r\ncivil servants and Ministers.  Just about one month ago,  the\r\n\r\nresults  of  the 1999 Labour Force Survey were published  and\r\n\r\nthey were a reminder for us that things are not all well  for\r\n\r\nall Singaporeans.  Much of the discussion that has ensued  in\r\n\r\nthe  weeks since have focused particularly on the bottom  12%\r\n\r\nof households with income of less than $1,000.  Not that much\r\n\r\nattention  was  paid  to  the next  category  which  was  the\r\n\r\nhouseholds  with income of $1,000 to below $3,000.   This  is\r\n\r\nanother full additional 30% of our population.  While we  are\r\n\r\ncertainly  not destitute, they are not anywhere close  within\r\n\r\nreach  of  what we all consider the good material  things  in\r\n\r\nlife.   And we all know and recognise that cost will continue\r\n\r\nto  increase and that, with this increasing cost, this  group\r\n\r\nwill  also struggle more and more to be able to afford  these\r\n\r\ngood  things.  These two groups together comprise a full  42%\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no argument with the philosophy of paying a\r\n\r\nperson  his  worth and of the importance of having  the  best\r\n\r\npeople in leadership.  But with this juxtaposition of earning\r\n\r\ncapacities right now so starkly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhighlighted,  I  strongly and sincerely urge the  Government,\r\n\r\nour  top civil servants and Ministers that, as the Government\r\n\r\ncontinues in its work to formulate and implement policies and\r\n\r\nprogrammes, it takes pains to be seen to be sensitive to  the\r\n\r\naspirations   of  and  gives  adequate  weightage   to,   not\r\n\r\nalienating, this full 40% of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br>5.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I thank all the MPs who have  contributed  to\r\n\r\nthis  debate.  It has been a very good airing and arguing  of\r\n\r\nthe  issues.  Rather than replying to the MPs one by  one,  I\r\n\r\nwill  group the issues together into seven separate  sections\r\n\r\nand deal with them block by block.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first group of concerns raised has to do with the\r\n\r\nquality of the civil service.  Pay them well, yes, but ensure\r\n\r\nthat they perform.  Prof. Chin Tet Yung argued that selection\r\n\r\nfor Public Service Leadership positions must be rigorous.  Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo  asked  whether  the  civil  service  quality  will  be\r\n\r\nmaintained.   He asked whether we have attracted good  people\r\n\r\nsince the last revision.  And Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Ravindran\r\n\r\nand   several   others  strenuously  argued   for   measuring\r\n\r\nperformance   and  penalising  non-performers  transparently.\r\n\r\nThey  did  not  ask  to cane them.  I fully  agree.   And  Mr\r\n\r\nZulkifli  raised the question of free riders,  which  is  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing.  I fully agree with Members that selection  must\r\n\r\nbe  rigorous and standards must be high and must be enforced.\r\n\r\nAnd  we  have  not left this to chance since the last  salary\r\n\r\nrevision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years, since 1995, for the\r\n\r\nAdministrative Service, we recruited 148 people, that  means,\r\n\r\nnearly 30 a year.  We lost 115 for a net gain of 33.   So  we\r\n\r\nnow have 275 Administrative Officers.  The people who left  - left through resignations, left through retirement - part  of\r\n\r\nthis  outflow  happened  by itself, or  maybe  even  happened\r\n\r\ndespite  our  best efforts to discourage good  officers  from\r\n\r\nleaving.   But  an  important part of this  outflow  was  the\r\n\r\nresult of active management, as we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nredeployed our people who did not fit into the Administrative\r\n\r\nService  career  track.   So there has  been  a  considerable\r\n\r\namount  of  turnover every year in order to leaven the  group\r\n\r\nand to raise the standard of the group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we measure the CEP, the potential of the officers who\r\n\r\nare  in  the Administrative Service, five years ago and  now,\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  a  significant improvement.   Look  at  the\r\n\r\nofficers  aged  30  and above, when they  have  been  in  the\r\n\r\nservice  for  some  years and we are  able  to  form  a  good\r\n\r\nassessment of their standard and where they can go, how  many\r\n\r\nof  them can make it into a Deputy Secretary position, or now\r\n\r\nwhat  we will call a PSL position.  Five years ago, less than\r\n\r\nhalf,  about  46%.  Today, after the turnover and  after  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment,  63%  have the potential to  make  it  into  PSL\r\n\r\npositions, nearly two thirds.  These are regular assessments.\r\n\r\nWe  have  committees, we have cross-checking, PSC  interviews\r\n\r\nthe  officers  and  confirms  them.   So  we  are  reasonably\r\n\r\nconfident that the quality of the service has gone up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have been discriminating in rewarding the\r\n\r\nperformers  as opposed to the non-performers in the  service.\r\n\r\nWe  have the performance bonus.  It has been a valuable  tool\r\n\r\nfor   making  a  distinction.   Some  MPs  said  it  is   not\r\n\r\ntransparent.    Is   this  the  way  to   pay   people   more\r\n\r\nautomatically?   It  is not.  You work for  your  performance\r\n\r\nbonus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the Prime Minister had provided the\r\n\r\ndistribution  for the Ministers, how many received  how  many\r\n\r\nmonths of performance bonus.  For the Administrative Officers\r\n\r\n(AOs),  we  have  divided  them into  four  categories.   \"A\"\r\n\r\nperformers, very few; \"B\" performers, well above average; \"C\"\r\n\r\nperformers,  who  get  the base rate,  are  doing  well,  but\r\n\r\naverage; and sub-performers, who get nothing.  Last year, 234\r\n\r\npeople  were  eligible to receive performance  bonuses.   \"A\"\r\n\r\ngraders, 3; \"B\" graders, 68.  So to get an \"A\" or \"B\"  grade,\r\n\r\nyou  must  be  at least in the top third.  \"C\" graders,  155,\r\n\r\nmost of the rest; but no performance bonus, 8.  So there is a\r\n\r\npossibility of your being graded below average.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd  if you continue to deserve zero performance bonus, after\r\n\r\na couple of years, something more drastic will happen to you.\r\n\r\nIt  is not the quota.  We do not automatically rank everybody\r\n\r\nand  say  the  bottom person will forcibly be taken  out  and\r\n\r\nshot.   But  we  make a hard-headed assessment  and  we  have\r\n\r\ninstituted  procedures  to  make  sure  that  hard-headedness\r\n\r\nprevails and we do not after a while, out of the goodness  of\r\n\r\nour  heart, lower our standards and slacken in what we expect\r\n\r\npeople to perform.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will continue to manage the Administrative\r\n\r\nService,  to continue to recruit new talent, and to  continue\r\n\r\nto  manage  officers  who do not fit into the  Administrative\r\n\r\nService career path, and retention criteria.  And now that we\r\n\r\nhave  defined the Public Service Leadership positions,  these\r\n\r\nretention  criteria are going to be more stringent.   Because\r\n\r\nthe  test is: do you have the potential to make it into a PSL\r\n\r\npost?  And if so, you stay;  if not, we have to move you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, notwithstanding the calls for blood and thunder, we\r\n\r\nhave to handle this carefully and sensitively, because we are\r\n\r\ndealing  with good officers and we do not want to  demoralise\r\n\r\nthe  service.   It is an unavoidable reality.  Not  everybody\r\n\r\nwho  joins  the  service  will  really  turn  out  to  be   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  and  ideal cut to be an  AO.   Some  work  out,\r\n\r\nhopefully  most will; some do not.  And we must take  chances\r\n\r\nand  try people out.  Because if everybody who comes in works\r\n\r\nout,  my conclusion is that we were too cautious at the entry\r\n\r\npoint and we must have turned away many people who could have\r\n\r\nworked  out, but whom we did not take a chance on.  So  there\r\n\r\nmust be some expectation of people who came in and have to be\r\n\r\nmoved  out.   But  not  everybody who  has  to  move  out  is\r\n\r\nnecessarily failing to make the effort.  We decided to  bring\r\n\r\nhim  in.  We decided to judge that he might do it.  It turned\r\n\r\nout  that he could not.  It is as much our responsibility  as\r\n\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So therefore, when people leave because of exigencies of\r\n\r\nservice, or because we have changed our critieria, or because\r\n\r\nwe have decided to take a chance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  him  and it did not work, then we have to look after  him\r\n\r\nand  move him in such a way that he maintains his honour  and\r\n\r\nhis  standing.  Publicly shaming him will be unnecessary  and\r\n\r\ncounter-productive.  That is not the way you  manage  people.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  if  somebody is recalcitrant or  non-performing,\r\n\r\nthen, by all means, tar and feather him publicly and make  an\r\n\r\nexample  of him.  But fortunately, while there are  some  bad\r\n\r\nperformers  or non-performers in the service, the people  who\r\n\r\ndeserve this extreme treatment are few.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of risks and rewards of which\r\n\r\nmuch  has  been made.  Starting with Mr Tay Beng  Chuan,  who\r\n\r\nsaid you cannot compare Ministers and AOs with entrepreneurs,\r\n\r\nlike  Bill  Gates and Li Kashing, because they venture  their\r\n\r\nown  money, they make it, they make it big.  If they do  not,\r\n\r\nthey  are  totally wiped out.  Fair enough.  But we  are  not\r\n\r\ndoing  that.  We are comparing Ministers with the executives,\r\n\r\nprofessionals  and  managers,  the  people  working  for  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, like Bill Gates or Li Kashing,  and  they  are\r\n\r\npaid well in the private sector.  If you are a CEO of IBM, or\r\n\r\nHewlett  Packard, you are paid well.  As Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock\r\n\r\npointed out, very well in the US.  In Singapore, not quite so\r\n\r\nwell,  but  still, that is the group we are  comparing  with.\r\n\r\nThat is the right level which we want to compare with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Ong Chit Chung pointed out, there is a perception\r\n\r\nthat  the civil service is an iron rice bowl and the  private\r\n\r\nsector  is  much riskier.  I would concede that  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  environment is more volatile than the civil  service,\r\n\r\nalthough I would not say that it is more risky than political\r\n\r\noffice.   Because  in political office, you have  totally  no\r\n\r\ntenure  at  all.   You have no contract.   If  you  lose  the\r\n\r\nelections,  you are out.  If you lose the confidence  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, you are finished.  And you cannot just go on to a new\r\n\r\njob  easily because, having publicly not worked out, that  is\r\n\r\nsomething  which you carry on your CV for the  rest  of  your\r\n\r\nlife.  So the comparison is not so extreme.  And if you  look\r\n\r\nat the private sector, if you are working for an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMNC, or a large law firm, or an accounting firm, the risk  is\r\n\r\nnot  so  large.  It is not one little boat in a great  ocean.\r\n\r\nYou  are  working on an ocean liner.  IBM may go up or  down.\r\n\r\nIf  you are Louis Gerstner, you have to turn it around.   But\r\n\r\nif  you are a top executive in IBM, working with the company,\r\n\r\nthen  you  can expect a certain stability which may  well  be\r\n\r\ngreater than the stability of many governments in the  world.\r\n\r\nSo there is a point, but it should not be overstated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the test is: with the pay which we have set,\r\n\r\nare people leaving the private sector to queue up to join the\r\n\r\npublic  service?   Or are people queueing  up  to  leave  the\r\n\r\npublic service and join the private sector?  That is the test\r\n\r\nwhether  you  have  overpaid  or  underpaid.   And  by   this\r\n\r\ncriterion,  there  is no evidence that the civil  service  is\r\n\r\noverpaying people as a group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way forward out of this issue is to move away from\r\n\r\nabsolute  job security, and not to pay less because you  have\r\n\r\ngreater job security.  We have no more iron rice bowls in the\r\n\r\ncivil service.  I do not know where Mr Seng Han Thong used to\r\n\r\nsee golden rice bowls.  But I have never spotted any of them.\r\n\r\nIf  he  does, I would appreciate it if he will let  me  know.\r\n\r\nBut  what we have done now to move towards less absolute  job\r\n\r\nsecurity, less absolute rewards is, firstly, to increase  the\r\n\r\nperformance  bonus  component substantially.   And  secondly,\r\n\r\nwith  the Public Service Leadership framework where  we  talk\r\n\r\nabout  the 10-year period of appointment at the DS level  and\r\n\r\n10 years at the PS level, that is a fixed term, rather than a\r\n\r\nlifetime  commitment.   It  is  a  major  step  to  take  and\r\n\r\nnewspapers  have highlighted it and Members have  caught  on,\r\n\r\nbut  it is a step which we have to take carefully because  it\r\n\r\nis a fundamental change and we better consider carefully that\r\n\r\nwe do not go too far.  We move and assess and, if need be, we\r\n\r\nmove  further  but it is not something which you  can  adjust\r\n\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a turnover. Even in the natural course of\r\n\r\nevents, with the changes we are making, the turnover will  be\r\n\r\nthere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  there is an acceptable rate.  It will vary from  service\r\n\r\nto  service.   But  if the turnover is too low,  it  is  also\r\n\r\nsomething to worry about.  If you ask me now today, is  there\r\n\r\na  problem,  I  will say, yes, because when you compare  this\r\n\r\nyear's  turnover  with last year's, it has gone  up  sharply,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  senior officers, whether  it  is  the  other\r\n\r\nservices, it has gone up, compared to last year, and  nothing\r\n\r\nelse  has changed except that the gap with the private sector\r\n\r\nhas  widened.  Therefore, we believe that that  is  the  main\r\n\r\nproblem.   Talking to the officers confirms  this.   We  also\r\n\r\nhave  to  make  sure  that other conditions  are  right,  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  of  the job, the working conditions,  the  way  we\r\n\r\ntreat  our officers and plan their careers, these are  things\r\n\r\nwe  have  to look at too, but salary is something  which  you\r\n\r\ncannot ignore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we did our comparison with the private sector,\r\n\r\nwe  are  not comparing with the top.  We are saying, \"Let  us\r\n\r\nlook  at  the 75th percentile of the private sector  for  the\r\n\r\nvarious  services in the civil service.\"  How do we  compare?\r\n\r\nWe  found that the gap was quite large.  In fact, the gap  is\r\n\r\nabout  20%  but  we  decided  that  we  will  not  close   it\r\n\r\ncompletely.   We  will make this adjustment,  that  is,  13%,\r\n\r\nwhich   I  announced  yesterday,  and  let  us  assess   more\r\n\r\ncarefully.   Where we need, we can make a greater adjustment;\r\n\r\nwhere we do not, we can just hold it there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group of questions which MPs have raised is\r\n\r\nthe possible deleterious side effects of this salary revision\r\n\r\npackage.   Mr  Ang  Mong Seng and Mr Chew  Heng  Ching  asked\r\n\r\nwhether the additional personnel cost is provided for in  the\r\n\r\nbudget.  The  answer is no. However, the budget  surplus  for\r\n\r\nthis year which has been projected is sufficient to cover the\r\n\r\nadditional  cost, which is $400 million. Some Ministries  may\r\n\r\nneed  to  come  back  to  Parliament and  pass  supplementary\r\n\r\nbudgets in order to pay for this, but it will be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the higher civil service salaries push up the cost\r\n\r\nof  utilities, public transport and so on?  Dr Vasoo  and  Mr\r\n\r\nChew Heng Ching asked this.  Because we are paying it out  of\r\n\r\nthe budget, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincreases should not affect the cost of PUB utilities, public\r\n\r\ntransport  and  so on.  They have to move for other  reasons.\r\n\r\nAnyway,  public transport is not Government-run.   Those  are\r\n\r\nprivate  companies.   But  in the cases  where  services  are\r\n\r\nprovided  on  a cost recovery basis, for example, healthcare,\r\n\r\nand where wages are a major component of the cost, then it is\r\n\r\nunavoidable that somehow or other patients have  to  bear  at\r\n\r\nleast part of the wage cost, whether it is 20%, whether it is\r\n\r\n15% for the C class or whether it is 100% for the A class.  A\r\n\r\nlarge  part  of  what you pay goes towards  the  doctors  and\r\n\r\nnurses,  the hospital staff, not the x-ray machines  and  the\r\n\r\noperating  theatres.   But we have no  choice.   If  we  want\r\n\r\nbetter  services, we need to pay the doctors and  the  nurses\r\n\r\nproperly and this costs money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a letter in the Straits Times recently which\r\n\r\nsaid  that the writer went to queue up at the polyclinic  and\r\n\r\nhe  was made to wait a long time, and the doctor was harassed\r\n\r\nand  packing up her bag while talking to him and so on.   Why\r\n\r\ncan't he have better services?  But it costs money and one of\r\n\r\nthe reasons the doctor appeared harassed is because we do not\r\n\r\nhave enough doctors.  We are not paying enough to the doctors\r\n\r\nin  the polyclinics who are doing a heavy and difficult  job,\r\n\r\nand  we  will  have to raise the pay of the  doctors  in  the\r\n\r\npolyclinic  to improve the service, because the  public  does\r\n\r\nnot  tolerate poor service either and somehow or other,  this\r\n\r\nexpense  has  to  be covered.  I saw that Mr  Lim  Hng  Kiang\r\n\r\nanswered  this question very carefully when he announced  the\r\n\r\ndoctor's salary revision a couple of days ago, but  it  is  a\r\n\r\nreality.   Personal services are expensive and,  in  fact,  a\r\n\r\nmajor  component of cost increases in the developed countries\r\n\r\nand it is going to affect us too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan, Dr Vasoo and Mr Chew Heng Ching asked\r\n\r\nabout  excessive civil service salary increases causing  wage\r\n\r\ninflation.   I  would  make  three  points.  First,  we   are\r\n\r\nfollowing, not leading the private sector. I have  said  this\r\n\r\nagain  but it is an important point.  I think we have to  say\r\n\r\nit repeatedly.  We are not leading, we are not pushing it up.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot be left\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbehind  too many steps.  One step, yes, three steps, you  can\r\n\r\nsay that is the Asian style, walk three paces behind.  But if\r\n\r\nyou continue three paces behind for too long, your system  is\r\n\r\ngoing to run into trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I accept that making the Government a more\r\n\r\ncompetitive  employer will mean making it more difficult  for\r\n\r\nthe private sector to recruit, especially to recruit from the\r\n\r\npublic service. That cannot be helped. We cannot stand  there\r\n\r\nand helplessly watch our lawyers leave, our nurses leave, our\r\n\r\nclerks   leave,   our   senior   officers   leave   and   our\r\n\r\nAdministrative Officers leave and say that this is  good  for\r\n\r\nthe private sector.  It may be good for the private sector in\r\n\r\nthe  short  term, but if the Government falls down,  that  is\r\n\r\nvery  bad  for  the  private sector.   So  we  have  to  stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  But we must also make sure that civil  servants\r\n\r\nrecruited  by  the  Government are employed productively  and\r\n\r\njustify  their pay. When we take that person and put  him  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government, he is actually producing something  and  not\r\n\r\njust a drone, not just a parasite. Then he justifies his  pay\r\n\r\nbecause otherwise, we are just going to have a large class of\r\n\r\npeople sharpening pencils and pushing papers, and we will  be\r\n\r\nwasting resources and causing wage inflation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that this year, we have put the\r\n\r\nGovernment salary revision and the NWC award together.  It is\r\n\r\ntwo in one. Traditionally, the NWC award has been a benchmark\r\n\r\nfor  private sector NWC adjustments.  But this year,  because\r\n\r\nthe  two  of  them have been put together into  one  package,\r\n\r\nwhich  includes  the  AVC, the extra  performance  bonus  and\r\n\r\nmonthly  salaries, the total Government package, 13%,  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  taken as the norm for private sector settlements. We  are\r\n\r\ncatching up and this package is not only NWC. There is salary\r\n\r\nadjustment  to  catch up. The private sector companies  which\r\n\r\nhave  justification in salary adjustment can argue their  own\r\n\r\ncase,  but  I do not think it will be fair to use  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice as a benchmark.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Simon Tay asked whether we could consult the\r\n\r\nprivate sector when the Government makes pay revisions.  I am\r\n\r\nafraid  the answer has to be no. The private sector does  not\r\n\r\nconsult  us  when they make pay revisions.  We have  no  wage\r\n\r\ncontrol or wage freeze and the Government cannot consult  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  when we make our pay revision.   It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible.  We  have to decide what is right and  we  have  to\r\n\r\njudge.  We have the responsibility and we have to answer  for\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth group of questions concerns the basic principle\r\n\r\nof paying the market rate for the job.  Mr Tay Beng Chuan was\r\n\r\nthe first to raise this, talking about the spirit of personal\r\n\r\nsacrifice  which  is required because of tripartism,  because\r\n\r\nwithout  sacrifice, leaders will not deserve  respect,  trust\r\n\r\nand confidence.  And others too, including Mr Zulkifli and Mr\r\n\r\nChiam,  talked about moral authority.  It is a  basic  point.\r\n\r\nThere  has  to  be,  and  there is  some  personal  sacrifice\r\n\r\ninvolved in public service, otherwise, it would not be called\r\n\r\npublic  service. But the sacrifice cannot be so large  as  to\r\n\r\nput off able men.  A business leader earns a full wage but he\r\n\r\nis  respected for his business acumen, for his organisational\r\n\r\nskills,  for his professionalism and the results he produces.\r\n\r\nWhy  should a political leader not be judged in the same  way\r\n\r\nby  his acumen, organisational skill, professionalism and the\r\n\r\nresults  he produces?  If he is paid nothing and produces  no\r\n\r\nresults, he deserves no respect.  If he is paid properly  and\r\n\r\nhe delivers results, I think he is fully entitled to respect.\r\n\r\nHe  is doing an honourable job. There is nothing improper  or\r\n\r\ndishonourable about it.  He should not enrich himself through\r\n\r\npublic service but why does he have to make a large financial\r\n\r\nsacrifice just to prove his credentials?  As Dr Ker  Sin  Tze\r\n\r\nhas  asked:  can we find people who will do this in  peaceful\r\n\r\ntimes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Mr Tay Beng Chuan described and the other MPs also\r\n\r\ntalked  about is indeed the model in many countries.   I  say\r\n\r\n\"model\" in the sense that that is how it works, not that that\r\n\r\nis  the  ideal for us to follow.  Actually, in some of  these\r\n\r\ncountries, it is the other way round.  Politicians\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  not  respected and the public refuses to support  paying\r\n\r\nthem  properly and, therefore, they are unable to raise their\r\n\r\nwages.  That is why the British Members of Parliament had  to\r\n\r\nstand up and say, \"We are very embarrassed to talk about this\r\n\r\nbecause  the public will not countenance raising politicians'\r\n\r\nwages.\"  And so too in other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just in Australia recently and the MPs said to me,\r\n\r\n\"Your  politicians  are paid well.\"  I said,  \"Yes,  we  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to make it a clean wage.\" They said, \"If we  did  it\r\n\r\nhere,  we would be sacked.  We would be out.\"  They  did  not\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Here,  we all volunteer to sacrifice.\"   But  it  just\r\n\r\ncould not be done in their environment.  I was talking to  an\r\n\r\nAmerican  central banker and he asked about our wages  -  how\r\n\r\nbig  the gap was.  He said that it was a real problem for him\r\n\r\nbecause  the  politicians' wages are not  moved  up,  so  his\r\n\r\npeoples'  wages cannot go up.  There is some sense of  public\r\n\r\nservice,  so  he still has some good officers.  What  is  the\r\n\r\nproblem?   Because  they  have  to  send  their  children  to\r\n\r\ncollege.   So what he does is once a person comes in,  if  he\r\n\r\nthinks the chap is good, he moves him right to the top of his\r\n\r\nscale  immediately. And he says, \"You please save this  money\r\n\r\nup,  so  when  you reach the top of your career and  you  are\r\n\r\nstill at that salary point, at least you would have been able\r\n\r\nto  accumulate  savings over the last five or ten  years  and\r\n\r\nwould  be  able to send your children to college.  You  would\r\n\r\nnot  have to come and tell me that you have to resign to send\r\n\r\nyour children to college.\"  So it is a real problem.  As  for\r\n\r\nBill  Clinton,  of whom much was made, the  US  Congress  has\r\n\r\ndecided  that they are going to double the salaries, starting\r\n\r\nwith the next President. They could not do it for themselves.\r\n\r\nIt  is  politically untenable.  But it is a problem and  they\r\n\r\nare  going  to double it. When we say we follow the  American\r\n\r\nexample,  I  think  we should understand  what  the  American\r\n\r\nexample entails.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have chosen a different formula. It has worked for\r\n\r\nus, and I think we better keep it.  I would not shy away from\r\n\r\nthis  transparency  by moderating the salary  increase  using\r\n\r\nsupplementary incentives\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  rewards, as Mr Tay Beng Chuan pointed out. We go  for  a\r\n\r\nclean wage.  What we declare is what the Ministers get. It is\r\n\r\nmore transparent.  It is more sensible.  It is better to  pay\r\n\r\n$968,000 and be honest and open about it than to pay a  small\r\n\r\nnominal wage and top it up with perks.  Perks cause money too\r\n\r\n- to provide maids, cars, houses, free holidays and education\r\n\r\nfor   children  is  very  expensive.  Besides,  we  will   be\r\n\r\ngenerating  a privileged class of people who then will  start\r\n\r\narguing  what car you are entitled to, which holiday are  you\r\n\r\nallowed  to go, can you travel first-class or business  class\r\n\r\non  holiday and so on.  So as Dr Tan Cheng Bock pointed  out,\r\n\r\nwe show all components.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that we are not transparent\r\n\r\nenough. What else is there which we have not declared,  which\r\n\r\nis not in the Table I handed out yesterday? There is nothing,\r\n\r\nthat  is  it.   It  is broken down in many  different  pieces\r\n\r\nbecause there are different purposes, bonuses, allowances and\r\n\r\nso  on,  but  all  the pieces are declared and  however  many\r\n\r\npieces there are, it adds up to that total sum of money.  And\r\n\r\nif  you  want to know what the pieces are, the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nhas  done  its homework.  Instead of asking your  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssistants,  you can look up the Straits Times today  and  it\r\n\r\nprovides  a  neat little tabulation of what the Superscale  G\r\n\r\nsalary  consists  of, what the Staff Grade I salary  consists\r\n\r\nof. There is nothing else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going on from the principle, MPs also argued about the\r\n\r\ndetailed  basis of the benchmark. Mr Iswaran asked:  does  it\r\n\r\ninclude   foreigners?   Does  it  include  bankers  who   are\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs?  The answer is no. The benchmark only includes\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and also Malaysians who are Permanent  Residents\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  because  that is really  one  labour  market.\r\n\r\nForeigners are out and bankers who are entrepreneurs are also\r\n\r\nexplicitly  excluded. This has always been the  case,  it  is\r\n\r\nnothing new.  Members may have forgotten or may not have been\r\n\r\npresent at the last debate, I think it is worth clarifying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major point made is that the list of top earners\r\n\r\nchanges every year, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntherefore  Ministers earn much more than any person  outside.\r\n\r\nMr  Shanmugam raised this.  Mr Ang Mong Seng said that it  is\r\n\r\nlike two aeroplanes, one of which is in the air all the time.\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam  See  Tong  raised this,  and  Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock\r\n\r\nsuggested that maybe out of the 48, we have 24 people  fixed,\r\n\r\nand  24  people change from year to year.  I am not sure  how\r\n\r\nyou  fix  them, because sometimes they grow old, they  retire\r\n\r\nand  sometimes  they  change  jobs.   But  I  understand  the\r\n\r\nsentiment of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several answers to this. The first answer is\r\n\r\nthat Ministers and civil servants also have no permanence. We\r\n\r\nare  not  here forever.  We are here while we are  doing  the\r\n\r\njob.   When we are no longer the Minister, we are  out.   Our\r\n\r\naeroplane  has  landed.  How much should they be  paid  while\r\n\r\nthey  are doing the job  -  an amount comparable to what  top\r\n\r\nexecutives with similar responsibilities earn in the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to have an alternative approach, as Mr\r\n\r\nZulkifli  has  suggested.   Get a pay  consultant,  make  pay\r\n\r\ncomparisons,  survey  the  industry,  identify  other   firms\r\n\r\nagainst   which  you  are  comparing  yourself,  benchmarking\r\n\r\nyourself  or  against  which  you  are  competing,  and  then\r\n\r\nascertain how much executives in these firms are paid.  It is\r\n\r\na  way  private sector companies do it, and it is a practical\r\n\r\napproach.   We  studied it quite extensively in  this  review\r\n\r\nbefore  finally deciding, no, we better go back  to  the  old\r\n\r\napproach of highest paid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons. First, because the process\r\n\r\ncannot  be  totally  transparent  or  automatic.   There   is\r\n\r\njudgment.   You  have  to decide whom  to  include,  whom  to\r\n\r\nexclude,  and  you will have to review the list of  companies\r\n\r\nfrom year to year. It is not a fixed list.  Then you have  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  the companies and say, \"Is it a foreigner or  not?\"\r\n\r\nAnd  too  much  judgment goes in for it to  be  an  automatic\r\n\r\nformula.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that if we do it that way by using\r\n\r\na  private survey, the data would be less reliable  than  the\r\n\r\nIRAS' data.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIRAS sees your total pay, or at least they have a fairly good\r\n\r\nsense  of what your total pay is.  And if they have any doubt\r\n\r\nthat  that is your total pay, they will look into the  matter\r\n\r\nand  satisfy  themselves  as  to  what  the  truth  is.   Pay\r\n\r\nconsultants  -  Towers Perrin, A T Kearney or whoever  it  is\r\n\r\n-  do not have quite the same binocular and telescopic vision\r\n\r\nin  these matters.  They have an impression.  It is not quite\r\n\r\nas accurate.  I think, overall, for purposes of automatically\r\n\r\ncomputing  a  benchmark, it is better just  to  use  the  top\r\n\r\nearners as a proxy for the leaders in each profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some bias, because the top earners change from\r\n\r\nyear  to  year, and there is a certain amount of  randomness.\r\n\r\nMaybe  by chance, that person's business was good and he  was\r\n\r\nranked  high  that  year.   But then  so  too  with  the  top\r\n\r\ncompanies, because companies go up, go down, and I will  have\r\n\r\nto  continue to compare against the top companies.   We  have\r\n\r\ntried to minimise the bias.  First, by increasing the samples\r\n\r\nfrom  24 to 48; secondly, by using the median instead of  the\r\n\r\nmean.   And also the two-thirds factor which we apply to  the\r\n\r\nbenchmark tends to go on the opposite direction to bring down\r\n\r\nyour numbers.  So that also compensates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, our answer is $968,000, ranked 367th amongst\r\n\r\nprivate sector earners, based on this year's revision  or  if\r\n\r\nwe  went for the full benchmark, $1.21 million, ranked 206th.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that is an eminently reasonable outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many other suggestions made by other MPs. Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran  said  why  not  just use the 200th  ranking  private\r\n\r\nsector  earner.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock said why not cap the  size\r\n\r\nof  the  stock option gains, maybe at $1 million.  We can  do\r\n\r\nmany  of these things.  Numerically, I think, one way or  the\r\n\r\nother, it would come out at about the same place.  But we are\r\n\r\nlooking  for sound rationale to make the comparison,  because\r\n\r\nthe  benchmark is not only a numerical formula, it is also  a\r\n\r\nstatement  of  where  you  peg your Ministers,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and  job scope.  What is  the  group  against\r\n\r\nwhich   we  should  rank  our  Ministers  and  compare  their\r\n\r\noutcomes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd  we say we should rank against the top professionals  and\r\n\r\nexecutives  in  the  private sector with  general  management\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  That was the definition in the White Paper\r\n\r\nand I think that is the right definition.  In other words,  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  compare our people  -  the Ministers and the  Staff\r\n\r\nGrade  I Permanent Secretaries  -  with people in the private\r\n\r\nsector holding that level of jobs with that standing in their\r\n\r\nprofessions.  So I am really talking about the top 24  people\r\n\r\n-   four  professions times six.  But to give my number  more\r\n\r\nstability,  to  make some adjustment, in  case  the  top  man\r\n\r\nhappens not to have top pay that year, so, all right, we have\r\n\r\ndecided  we will go to 48 people instead of 24.   And  it  is\r\n\r\nstill representative, but stabler.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is different from saying I will aim for number 200\r\n\r\nor  367, because I am not aiming just for the number.   I  am\r\n\r\naiming  for  that category and, as I will show later,  number\r\n\r\n367  includes  many people in front of it.  As Mr  Noris  Ong\r\n\r\nsays,  very sensibly, finally, you are looking for a  reality\r\n\r\ncheck.  Do not get caught up on the technical details of  how\r\n\r\nthe  benchmark is calculated.  Just have a reality check;  is\r\n\r\nthe  outcome  reasonable, rank 200th for the full  benchmark,\r\n\r\nrank  367th  for  the present adjustment?  I think,  on  that\r\n\r\nbasis, we pass the reality check.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not go for a link to the median per capita\r\n\r\nincome and multiply by X, as Mr Simon Tay suggested.  We have\r\n\r\na  component in the package which is linked to GDP.  I  think\r\n\r\nit  is the most comprehensive single indicator of the overall\r\n\r\nperformance  of the economy, rather than any sub-group.   And\r\n\r\nwe  really  want growth, because growth is the first  target.\r\n\r\nWith  growth, you can have distribution.  If you  start  with\r\n\r\ndistribution and then hope to have growth, you are getting it\r\n\r\nthe  wrong way around.  So I would stick to GDP and  I  would\r\n\r\nstick  to  the basic principle that we are comparing  against\r\n\r\nthe top people in the private sector, and that is what I want\r\n\r\nto measure against.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the formula, the next question is: is the\r\n\r\nquantum reasonable?  This\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquestion was asked in different ways, firstly, by Mr Seng Han\r\n\r\nThong  and  Mr  Chay  Wai  Chuen  who  wanted  to  know  what\r\n\r\nprofessions are the 366 or 367 people who earn more than  the\r\n\r\nbenchmark.   The Clerk will now distribute the Tables  (Cols.\r\n\r\n631-634) .  We have tabulated them and you can see who  these\r\n\r\npeople are or at least what professions they are in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000630/20000630-HA-0720631.htm\">Table 1 - Professions of Top 366 Earners (Cols. 631 - 634)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the 366 people who earned more than the\r\n\r\nbenchmark,  namely, $968,000 in 1998 and  assessed  in  1999.\r\n\r\nYou  can  see that they belong to a wide range of professions\r\n\r\n-   accountants, bankers, manufacturers.  The legal  services\r\n\r\nare right at the top, large numbers.  These are the ones that\r\n\r\nwe  are  comparing against.  The one group we  are  comparing\r\n\r\nagainst,  not figured here, are the engineers who earn  less.\r\n\r\nBut  then  there  are  many other professions  who  also  are\r\n\r\nrepresented  in  the top 366 people  -  real estate,  medical\r\n\r\nservices,   ie,   doctors,  computer  services,   hospitality\r\n\r\nservices,  market  research, luxury  goods,  advertising.   I\r\n\r\nthink if you ask whether the Minister ought to be better than\r\n\r\nsome of the people on this list, I would say yes.  And if  he\r\n\r\nis  not better than somebody on this list, then he should not\r\n\r\nbe  a  Minister.  So I think that the figure is a  reasonable\r\n\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, look at the second page of Tables 2 and 3 (Cols.\r\n\r\n635-636),  to  have  a  look  at  what  the  individual   six\r\n\r\nprofessions  in the benchmark actually earn.  Table  2  shows\r\n\r\nthe  range  of  the  eight people in  each  profession.   The\r\n\r\nbankers  earn  $2.2-$4.5  million.   Lawyers  earn  $1.5-$2.8\r\n\r\nmillion.   That is completely typical.  Accountants earn  $2-$2.3  million, and so on.  Engineers earn less  -   $0.5-$0.8\r\n\r\nmillion,  but that is really because a lot of engineers  have\r\n\r\nbecome CEOs of companies and are not captured as professional\r\n\r\nengineers on this chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000630/20000630-HA-0720635.htm\">Tables 2 and 3 - Earning ranges of top 8 earners in 6 professions (Cols 635-636)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you discount for stock option gains because you think\r\n\r\nthey  are  volatile and discount by 50%, the numbers actually\r\n\r\ncome  out  about the same.  The only people who are  affected\r\n\r\nare  those working in multi-nationals who come down, both the\r\n\r\nlowest  and  highest.  And the local manufacturers  who  come\r\n\r\ndown for the lowest earner.  The highest did not change.   So\r\n\r\nit really does not make much\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifference.  I think you can see that a lot of people are  in\r\n\r\nthese income brackets.  These are not fictitious figures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We excluded doctors from the benchmark but, as you can\r\n\r\nsee  from  the  list on the first page, there are  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ndoctors who are in this earning category  -  11 people are in\r\n\r\nmedical  services.   And  if you  ask  about  the  top  eight\r\n\r\ndoctors, because Mr Simon Tay mentioned doctors and  I  think\r\n\r\nDr  Michael  Lim  too,  they earn between $1.12  million  and\r\n\r\n$2.48  million.   It is a little bit less than  lawyers.   So\r\n\r\ndoctors  have to care for their patients, not just  care  for\r\n\r\ntheir fees, but doctors do not earn negligible fees, which is\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have had to make significant adjustments to doctors'\r\n\r\nsalaries in the public sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of stock options which Dr Tan Cheng Bock\r\n\r\nfocused  on,  I have shown from the Table that they  actually\r\n\r\ndid  not make much difference in the past.  In the future,  I\r\n\r\nthink they will make a difference to the multi-nationals,  to\r\n\r\nthe  local manufacturers.  They were not figured for lawyers,\r\n\r\naccountants and engineers because there you are talking about\r\n\r\nprincipal earned income from their partnerships.  So they  do\r\n\r\nnot get stock options from their partnerships, unless one day\r\n\r\nwe  allow our law firms to become lawfirm.com.  When that day\r\n\r\ncomes, we will have another debate in the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the way we are calculating the benchmark now,\r\n\r\nnamely,  depending  on  the median,  because  we  have  these\r\n\r\nprofessions  -  lawyers, engineers and accountants, at least,\r\n\r\nand  probably  also the bankers  for now   -   without  stock\r\n\r\noptions,  even  if  the people who have  stock  options  have\r\n\r\ninflated  options, it is not going to make a disproportionate\r\n\r\nmove to your median, because they will be the few at the top,\r\n\r\nunless all 24 people have huge stock options and therefore it\r\n\r\naffects  your median.  If that happens, we will  look  at  it\r\n\r\nagain.   I  do not think that is imminent.  So the conclusion\r\n\r\nfrom this is that the adjustment is well justified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one group which I must confess which we\r\n\r\naccidentally omitted to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmention  although we did not omit to consider them, and  this\r\n\r\nwas  pointed  out by Mr Simon Tay and by a few other  Members\r\n\r\nprivately,  and  this  has  to do  with  the  Nominated  MP's\r\n\r\nallowance.   This  will be adjusted in  step  with  the  MP's\r\n\r\nallowance,  and so too the NCMP's allowance, proportionately.\r\n\r\nWe are completely fair and equal in these matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I pay some attention to the speakers whom I\r\n\r\nhave  agreed with, as opposed to speakers where we have  some\r\n\r\ndifference of views.  Prof. Chin Tet Yung, Mr Iswaran and  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Ah Heng urged us to restore the CPF as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI  fully agree.  We have accepted the NWC's recommendation to\r\n\r\nbring forward the next step to January 2001, and we have said\r\n\r\nthat  we will announce in October how big this next step will\r\n\r\nbe.   We  have to keep faith with the workers.  When we  told\r\n\r\nthem  that  things were bad and to cut, they cut and  agreed.\r\n\r\nNow that things are good and they want to restore it, we also\r\n\r\nwant  to  restore it, and it has to be restored  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.  2% has already come and I look forward to  another\r\n\r\nadjustment on 1st January.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think underlying this question is a different\r\n\r\nquestion,   which  was  what  Mr  Sin  Boon  Ann   explicitly\r\n\r\narticulated, and that was why we move Ministers' salaries now\r\n\r\nbefore  the  full CPF restoration.  Let me turn the  question\r\n\r\naround  and ask:  now that the economy is recovering, is  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector continuing to freeze its salaries?  No, before\r\n\r\nCPF  full restoration, it is moving up.  In fact, it  is  one\r\n\r\nreason why we are bringing forward the CPF restoration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the private sector is not freezing salaries, should\r\n\r\nwe  hold back all of the civil service salary revisions until\r\n\r\nthe  CPF is fully restored?  I think the answer has to be no,\r\n\r\nbecause if we did hold back, we are being unfair to the civil\r\n\r\nservants and we are going to lose more good officers, and the\r\n\r\nbest  ones are the ones who are going to go first.   Then  we\r\n\r\nwould  have  the  real problem which the MPs worry  about  of\r\n\r\npeople who are free-riding and under-performing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So should we move for the whole public sector but leave\r\n\r\nout the Ministers?  I think that would be wrong too.  Because\r\n\r\nit would show that we lack faith in our own argument that the\r\n\r\nMinisters' pay should follow the benchmark and the  benchmark\r\n\r\nshould follow the private sector up and down.  We have argued\r\n\r\nand  debated this.  We have decided that the benchmark is the\r\n\r\nway  to  go because we want to move with the private  sector,\r\n\r\nnot  automatically up alone, but both up  and  down.   In  an\r\n\r\nexceptional  situation when we are faced with  a  crisis,  we\r\n\r\nfroze the benchmark in 1998 and 1999.  The crisis is past and\r\n\r\nthe economy is recovering.  It is on the way up.  I think the\r\n\r\nright  thing to do is to move for the Ministers' salaries  to\r\n\r\ncatch up, but 80% of the full benchmark, and we phase out the\r\n\r\nadjustment over three years.  I think that is eminently fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Mr Thomas Thomas asked the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to re-commit itself to promoting social  mobility\r\n\r\nand   flexibility.   I  fully  agree  with  them.    I   also\r\n\r\nparticularly  agree with Mr Thomas Thomas  that  in  the  US,\r\n\r\nalthough  income  disparities are large, social  mobility  is\r\n\r\nsignificant.   The US social attitude towards the  successful\r\n\r\nones  who  make it big are positive, because everybody  hopes\r\n\r\nalso  to  do the same and to rise, and thinks that he  has  a\r\n\r\nchance  to get there.  It is the major reason why in  the  US\r\n\r\nthey  have  social  stability and the income  gap  is  not  a\r\n\r\npolitical problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income distributions are stretching out but this does\r\n\r\nnot  mean that hope is extinguished.  So long as we keep  our\r\n\r\nsociety  open and we help all citizens to start out  in  life\r\n\r\nwith  education, good health care, with a home, and  we  give\r\n\r\ntalent  from all backgrounds every opportunity to succeed,  I\r\n\r\nthink  that is to our benefit that we have these high  peaks.\r\n\r\nThey will bring others along and lift up the average for  the\r\n\r\nwhole society.  If we push the peaks down we are not going to\r\n\r\nraise  the  rest  of  the society.   We  are  going  to  push\r\n\r\neverybody down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to continue to look after low income groups and\r\n\r\ncreate  more  jobs for all.  As Mr Ravindran and Dr  Jennifer\r\n\r\nLee said, and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang put it in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChinese, not only Jin shang tian hua but also Xue zhong  song\r\n\r\ntan  not just add a rosette on to your brocade but also  send\r\n\r\ncoals  in  the snow to a needy person.  I fully  agree.   The\r\n\r\nstrategy should be what Mr Chay Wai Chuen explained, which is\r\n\r\nto  uplift the lower income households and not focus  on  the\r\n\r\nincome  gap  per se.  What is important is the level  of  the\r\n\r\nlower  income group. That Dr Jennifer Lee is able to say  the\r\n\r\n$1,000 to $3,000 household income group is something to worry\r\n\r\nabout  is a great tribute to Singapore.  Because in any other\r\n\r\nAsian  country,  if  one  is earning from  $1,000  to  $3,000\r\n\r\nhousehold  income,  owning a house  with  a  television  set,\r\n\r\nwashing  machine, telephone and probably handphone and  a  CD\r\n\r\nplayer,  one  would be very comfortably off.  In China,  they\r\n\r\nwould  consider  that an enormous achievement,  and  in  many\r\n\r\nother  countries in Asia too.  But in Singapore,  because  we\r\n\r\nhave  succeeded  in uplifting our people en masse,  even  the\r\n\r\nlower   income   groups  are  $1,000  to  $3,000   and   have\r\n\r\nconsiderable assets to their name.  I am not saying we should\r\n\r\nrest  on our laurels.  We should continue to work and  uplift\r\n\r\nthis  group  further.  But that this group is  already  in  a\r\n\r\nconsiderably  privileged  position compared  to  any  similar\r\n\r\nstratum in any other Asian society, that is not in doubt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the crucial point, which Mr Lim Boon Heng made\r\n\r\neloquently yesterday, that we must attract talent to come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We must retain talent, get Singaporeans  back  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and we must have good government.  Because  without\r\n\r\ngood  government, we can have very hardworking  and  talented\r\n\r\npeople,  but  we  are  going to have a lot  of  hardship  and\r\n\r\nsuffering.   This is crucial.  The future of all Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndepends on this and our revisions will help to achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs have understood this. Therefore, they have supported\r\n\r\nthis  policy.   I would like to thank all the MPs  for  their\r\n\r\ncontributions.   I think what we need to do now  is  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether  with them to raise the standards of public  service\r\n\r\nand  Government, to get people who are idealistic, committed,\r\n\r\npatriotic and capable to come forward and serve Singapore and\r\n\r\nto bring\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout a better future that we all aspire to.

I refer to Handout  2  that  DPM\r\n\r\ndistributed in Parliament yesterday.  Is the salary figure in\r\n\r\nthat  Table  inclusive of AVC, bonuses, etc?  Is it  a  gross\r\n\r\nfigure or a basic figure?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is a gross figure. It includes\r\n\r\neverything.   It  includes  the  monthly  pay,  AVC,  Special\r\n\r\nAllowance,  which the Ministers have been getting one  month,\r\n\r\nPublic   Service   Leadership   Allowance,   which   we   are\r\n\r\nintroducing, car allowance, which has always been  there  and\r\n\r\nis tax free.  So we actually imputed on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntop  of the car allowance the amount of tax which would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  paid if it were taxable and added that into the  bundle\r\n\r\nas  well the performance bonus and the GDP bonus.  It is  all\r\n\r\nlisted out in the Straits Times.  Go and check it up there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I take the vote, can I just remind\r\n\r\nhon.

MAS can  only\r\n\r\nencourage, not dictate. There have been no moves by the local\r\n\r\nbanks  to  merge  so far. As competition intensifies  in  the\r\n\r\nbanking industry, through the progress of technology and  our\r\n\r\nliberalisation measures, the pressure on banks to consolidate\r\n\r\nand rationalise will grow. Alternatively, banks can choose to\r\n\r\nbecome niche players in specific segments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures to open up the domestic banking market that\r\n\r\nMAS announced in May 1999 were the first instalment of a five\r\n\r\nyear  programme to liberalise the industry. MAS  will  review\r\n\r\nthe position next year before deciding on the next package of\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000630/20000630-HA-0720629.htm\">Table - Performance Bonus Distribution for Political Office-holders (Cols. 629-630)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000630/20000630-HA-0720631.htm\">Table 1 - Professions of Top 366 Earners (Cols. 631 - 634)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000630/20000630-HA-0720635.htm\">Tables 2 and 3 - Earning ranges of top 8 earners in 6 professions (Cols 635-636)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
