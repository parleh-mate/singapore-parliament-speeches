This valuable report, which\r\n\r\nhas   been  accepted  by  the  Government,  is  the\r\n\r\nculmination of careful deliberations by  the  3-man\r\n\r\nCommission  headed by Mr Justice  F.  A.  Chua  and\r\n\r\nassisted by Mr C. A. V. Chew and Mr Jimmy Chen  Wie\r\n\r\nYing,   and   I   wish   to   record   Government's\r\n\r\nappreciation of their public service. I  also  wish\r\n\r\nto  thank the various individuals and organisations\r\n\r\nlisted  in  the  Appendices  to  the  Report,   who\r\n\r\nsubmitted  memoranda  or  otherwise  assisted   the\r\n\r\nCommission in its work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Commission has found that the\r\n\r\nfire  that destroyed Robinson's Departmental  Store\r\n\r\nat  Raffles Place on the morning of 21st  November,\r\n\r\n1972,  resulting in the death of nine  persons  and\r\n\r\nthe destruction of property worth approximately $21\r\n\r\nmillion, was caused by a short circuit as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na result of the overloading of an electrical branch\r\n\r\ncircuit  on  the  ground floor. The  Commission  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the criticisms levelled at the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  of  poor  fire-fighting  performance   are\r\n\r\nunjustified, and that the Fire Brigade  fought  the\r\n\r\nfire  under trying conditions and had done well  in\r\n\r\ncontaining  the  fire  from  spreading   to   other\r\n\r\nbuildings  in that area. The Commission is  of  the\r\n\r\nview  that  by  the  time  the  Fire  Brigade   was\r\n\r\nsummoned,  Robinson's Departmental Store could  not\r\n\r\nhave  been saved. The fire had been allowed  to  be\r\n\r\nnursed  in  the loft stores without being detected,\r\n\r\nand  the  domestic fire-fighting squad was fighting\r\n\r\nthe  fire at the wrong locations. It is appropriate\r\n\r\nat  this  juncture for me to congratulate the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade not only on its commendable performance  on\r\n\r\nthat  occasion, but also on the general  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich it had performed its role for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the recommendations made by the\r\n\r\nCommission, Members many wish to know that many  of\r\n\r\nthe recommendations have, in fact, been implemented\r\n\r\nand some are being actively pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the recurrence of such a\r\n\r\ncatastrophe,  the  Commission has  recommended  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of legislation to enable  appropriate\r\n\r\nauthorities  to  implement  a  system  of  periodic\r\n\r\ninspections of places of public resort to check  on\r\n\r\nunauthorised additions and alterations to buildings\r\n\r\nwhich might endanger the safety of the public.  The\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control  Bill,  now  before  this  House,\r\n\r\nstrengthens the law in respect of building  control\r\n\r\nto  enable  the  Building Authority  to  take  more\r\n\r\nspeedy  and  effective action against  unauthorised\r\n\r\nbuilding   works   and  dangerous  buildings,   and\r\n\r\nprovides  for  enhanced  penalties  in  respect  of\r\n\r\noffences.   Provision  to  control,  regulate   and\r\n\r\nsupervise  places to which the public have  access,\r\n\r\nhas also been provided for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has recommended that for\r\n\r\nelectrical  installations of  a  stipulated  higher\r\n\r\ncurrent  rating,  consideration  be  given  by  the\r\n\r\nPublic Utilities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard   to   grade  the  licensing  of   electrical\r\n\r\ncontractors  so as to ensure that only  contractors\r\n\r\nwith  the  requisite  professional  expertise   and\r\n\r\nexperience are allowed to undertake such  work.  It\r\n\r\nwas  also suggested that the 1947 Municipal  Wiring\r\n\r\nRules  and Conditions of Supply should be  updated.\r\n\r\nIn  this connection, I must state that towards this\r\n\r\nend,   the  Public  Utilities  Board  has   already\r\n\r\ninitiated  action to draft appropriate  legislation\r\n\r\nand set up the necessary administrative machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further recommendation of the Commission is that\r\n\r\na    public   authority   be   charged   with   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for ensuring the proper construction\r\n\r\nand  maintenance of lifts to which the  public  may\r\n\r\nhave  access. The Ministry of National  Development\r\n\r\nhas decided in this connection to place the control\r\n\r\nof  the installation of lifts and escalators  under\r\n\r\nits  Building Control Division, and the control  of\r\n\r\ntheir   maintenance  under  the   Commissioner   of\r\n\r\nBuildings  appointed under the Building and  Common\r\n\r\nProperty (Maintenance and Management) Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has also suggested that a Committee\r\n\r\nbe  formed to look into ways and means of  rescuing\r\n\r\npeople  trapped  in  lifts in situations  of  power\r\n\r\nfailure.  Representatives  from  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nNational   Development,   the   Building    Control\r\n\r\nDivision, the Singapore Fire Brigade, the Singapore\r\n\r\nInstitute of Standards and Industrial Research  and\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner  of Buildings  are  now  actively\r\n\r\nlooking  into  the  question  of  installation,  in\r\n\r\nlifts,  of equipment to facilitate emergency rescue\r\n\r\noperations and the operational aspects of  rescuing\r\n\r\npeople trapped in lifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another recommendation of the Commission is that\r\n\r\nall  lift  attendants be given proper  training  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  emergencies  and  that  managements  of\r\n\r\nestablishments  of  public resort  be  required  to\r\n\r\nprovide  effective  training  for  all  staff   and\r\n\r\ndomestic  fire-fighting squads in  preparation  for\r\n\r\nany  emergency. Here, I wish to point out that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Fire  Brigade has always  assisted  with\r\n\r\nsuch training on request. The necessity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   amending  existing  legislation  to  make   it\r\n\r\nmandatory  for  managements  of  establishments  of\r\n\r\npublic   resort  to  provide  for  the  recommended\r\n\r\ntraining  in  fire-fighting  and  in  dealing  with\r\n\r\nemergencies is being looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a few recommendations pertaining\r\n\r\nexclusively to the Singapore Fire Brigade have also\r\n\r\nbeen made by the Commission, viz: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that officers of higher rank in the Fire Brigade should supervise the Control Room operations;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that the formal training of firemen should\r\n\r\ninclude lift rescue operations; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that service conditions of serving officers\r\n\r\nbe improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Action  on  all  these  matters  has  already  been\r\n\r\ninitiated and is in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission also suggested that the Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade  should  be  responsible  for  the  regular\r\n\r\ninspection  of  all fire hydrants in the  Republic,\r\n\r\nalthough   they  are  maintained  by   the   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board. This recommendation  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  implemented and regular inspections  of  fire\r\n\r\nhydrants  are  now  being  conducted  by  the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also wish to know that very soon all\r\n\r\nfire    regulatory   functions,   including   those\r\n\r\npertaining to dangerous trades, will be transferred\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Fire  Brigade to  the  Building  Control\r\n\r\nDivision    under   the   Ministry   of    National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.   The  Assistant  Director   (Building\r\n\r\nControl  Division)  will  be  responsible  for  all\r\n\r\nmatters  pertaining  to safety in  buildings.  This\r\n\r\nwill  lessen the administrative burden on the  Fire\r\n\r\nBrigade and allow it to concentrate solely on fire-fighting,  devoting more time to the study  of  new\r\n\r\ntechniques of fighting fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although an efficient and modern\r\n\r\nfire  service  is  essential for saving  lives  and\r\n\r\nproperty,   the   primary   objective   should   be\r\n\r\npreventing the outbreak of fires. This requires the\r\n\r\ninsistence  of  a  high  standard  of  fire  safety\r\n\r\nrequirements in buildings, and educating the public\r\n\r\non fire safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fatalities as a result of fire were five in\r\n\r\n1970,  eight in 1971 and twelve in 1972. This year,\r\n\r\nto-date,  fires have claimed nine lives and  it  is\r\n\r\nessential   that  such  tragic  losses  should   be\r\n\r\nprevented. The figures for fire loss have  steadily\r\n\r\nincreased  over  the  last  three  years  - from  $4\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1970 to $6.2 million in 1971,  with  a\r\n\r\njump  to  $30.6 million in 1972. The fire  loss  in\r\n\r\n1973   to-date   amounts  to  $7.6   million.   The\r\n\r\nindiscriminate  discarding  of  lighted   cigarette\r\n\r\nbutts  and  matches and electrical  short  circuits\r\n\r\nhave  been  the  direct  causes  of  many  a  fire.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, greater vigilance and care by everyone\r\n\r\nwould minimise the incidence of fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance companies can also play a vital role in\r\n\r\nreducing fire losses by giving meaningful discounts\r\n\r\non  fire  premiums where fire protection facilities\r\n\r\nare  of  a  high standard. They could also increase\r\n\r\nthe  premiums or even refuse to underwrite  if  the\r\n\r\nfire protection measures are inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy at Robinson's Departmental Store has\r\n\r\nhighlighted the need to give fire-fighting and fire-prevention greater priority in our society.  As  we\r\n\r\nbecome    increasingly    more    urbanised     and\r\n\r\nindustrialised, and with the rapid  development  of\r\n\r\nhigh-rise  buildings, fire prevention requirements,\r\n\r\nthe training of staff in fire-fighting, as well  as\r\n\r\nthe   education  of  workers  on  fire   preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures and emergency requirements, will  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  constantly reviewed and regularly stressed.  We\r\n\r\nneed to overcome the common human tendency to shrug\r\n\r\noff  measures  laid  down to cope  with  unpleasant\r\n\r\nemergencies   (such  as  fire  drills)   as   being\r\n\r\nunnecessary, tedious and a waste of time.  A  small\r\n\r\ncountry, like ours particularly, can ill-afford the\r\n\r\nheavy  fire  losses, both in terms of manpower  and\r\n\r\nproperty,  which constitute a heavy  drain  on  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to stress that fire safety\r\n\r\nis  a community obligation, and every man, woman or\r\n\r\nchild  has  a social responsibility to ensure  that\r\n\r\nvigilance  is exercised at all times to prevent  an\r\n\r\noutbreak  of  fire. History is harsh to  those  who\r\n\r\nonly know how to use fire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  fail to exercise caution and vigilance and  to\r\n\r\ntake the necessary steps for its effective control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INCREASE IN PRICES OF HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Law and National Development)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present\r\n\r\nselling  prices  of  Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nflats  were fixed in 1965 when the \"Home  Ownership\r\n\r\nfor the People\" scheme was first introduced. In the\r\n\r\nlast  eight  years  the cost  of  providing  public\r\n\r\nhousing  has  risen  considerably,  mainly  due  to\r\n\r\nincreases  in,  firstly,  the  prices  of  building\r\n\r\nmaterials and wages pushing up construction  costs;\r\n\r\nsecondly,   land  cost;  thirdly,   clearance   and\r\n\r\nresettlement  costs; and lastly,  additional  costs\r\n\r\ndue  to  improvement  in the design  of  flats  and\r\n\r\nbetter  communal  and recreational facilities.  The\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board can, therefore,  no\r\n\r\nlonger  continue to sell flats at prevailing prices\r\n\r\nwithout incurring heavy losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are over 100,000 applicants on the waiting\r\n\r\nlist  for  Housing  Board flats; more  than  75,000\r\n\r\nwanting  to  buy  and more than 25,000  wanting  to\r\n\r\nrent.  The Board can only satisfy this great demand\r\n\r\nfor  flats without suffering a great financial loss\r\n\r\nif  the  selling prices of Housing Board flats  are\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from 1st January of next year, the selling\r\n\r\nprice  of Housing Board flats will he increased  by\r\n\r\n$2,000  for  two-room fiats, $4,000 for  three-room\r\n\r\nflats,  $6,000 for four-room flats and  $8,000  for\r\n\r\nfive-room flats. In order to help the lowest income\r\n\r\ngroups,  there will be no increase in  the  selling\r\n\r\nprice  of  one-room flats. The new  selling  prices\r\n\r\nwill  be as follows: one-room flat, no change. Two-room (standard), Urban $9,500, Suburban $8,200, New\r\n\r\nTown $6,900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will proceed to give the prices\r\n\r\nof various other categories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof flats in the Urban, Suburban and New Town\r\n\r\nareas respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                       Urban    Sub-     New \r\n\r\nTypes of Flat                   urban    Town\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo-room Improved      $11,000  $ 9,500   $8,000\r\n\r\nThree-room Standard    $14,500  $11,800  $10,200\r\n\r\nThree-room Improved    $17,500  $13,500  $11,800\r\n\r\nThree-room Corner      $18,500  $15,000  $12,800\r\n\r\nFour-room flats        $26,000  $21,500  $18,500\r\n\r\nFive-room flats        $41,000  $35,500  $30,000\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

My next  question\r\n\r\nis:  in view of the oil crisis, there is a move  to\r\n\r\ncut down wasteful use of electricity, may the House\r\n\r\nbe  informed as to what the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard is going to do about it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in direct reply, charges for\r\n\r\nservice and conservancy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  go up. The cost, I believe, is about $6.50  a\r\n\r\nday, but the costs of providing these services have\r\n\r\ngone  up,  particularly the amenities  for  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats which have improved considerably.  The\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  is responsible for  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nparks, playing fields and other improved amenities.\r\n\r\nBut there is one peculiarity and, that is, that the\r\n\r\nold  Singapore  Improvement Trust flats  have  been\r\n\r\ntotally  exempted from all service and  conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges ever since they were built. It is time this\r\n\r\npolicy was changed. All I can assure the Member  is\r\n\r\nthat  if these charges go up, they will go up  only\r\n\r\nsometime next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for rents, the likelihood is that they will go\r\n\r\nup,   but  we  will  give  consideration  to  these\r\n\r\nincreases only after receipt of the recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the National Wages Council, which will probably\r\n\r\nbe in the middle of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for energy conservation, every alternate\r\n\r\nlighting  point  along  the  common  corridors   of\r\n\r\nHousing  Board flats, except along the  staircases,\r\n\r\nhas  been  cut  off. Altogether 23,000  fluorescent\r\n\r\ntubes  have  been removed and kept in  the  stores.\r\n\r\nFurther, the lighting hours have been cut  down  by\r\n\r\ntwo  hours,  the common lights are switched  on  an\r\n\r\nhour  later  than before and switched off  an  hour\r\n\r\nearlier in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister  consider selling Housing Board  flats  at\r\n\r\nthe  old  rate  to those people affected  by  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal?  The reason is that since the compensation\r\n\r\nthey are going to receive is based on the old rate,\r\n\r\nthey should be allowed to purchase flats at the old\r\n\r\nrate. The Housing Board should not charge them  the\r\n\r\nhigher  selling prices now, because the  Board  was\r\n\r\nnot  able to allocate them any flats earlier.

Member does not know\r\n\r\nthat even the Housing Board, when it purchases land\r\n\r\nfrom the Government or from the private sector, has\r\n\r\nto  pay  for the land at market prices. One of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  I gave for the increase in building  costs\r\n\r\nwas  the increase in land costs which have gone  up\r\n\r\nconsiderably   in  Singapore.  Hence,  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy  statement last September barring foreigners\r\n\r\nfrom   purchasing   land   in   Singapore   without\r\n\r\npermission;  and  I  shall  be  tabling  the   Land\r\n\r\nAcquisition (Amendment) Bill very soon after  this.\r\n\r\nThis  is Government's effort to prevent speculation\r\n\r\nin  land  prices  in  order to  stabilise,  if  not\r\n\r\nlessen,  land  prices.  But  we  have  always  been\r\n\r\nconcerned  with the amount of compensation  payable\r\n\r\neither  to farmers in the rural areas or  to  urban\r\n\r\ndwellers. It was not long ago that the compensation\r\n\r\nrates went up, and if conditions are such that  the\r\n\r\namount of rates should go up, they will go up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwith  the increase in the purchase price of Housing\r\n\r\nBoard flats, will there be a consequent increase in\r\n\r\nthe rent for Housing Board flats?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I have said just now that\r\n\r\nconsideration  will be given to  such  an  increase\r\n\r\nsometime  next  year.

Sir, the next ballot will be sometime\r\n\r\nnext  year, and prices will go up. We must  have  a\r\n\r\ncut-off date. There have been letters to the  press\r\n\r\ngrumbling  about the flats in Marine  Parade  which\r\n\r\nare nearly ready, \"Why don't we sell them now?\" The\r\n\r\nobjection is this. If we balloted away one  or  two\r\n\r\nblocks  of flats in Marine Parade in December,  and\r\n\r\nthey  would have to be sold at the old prices, then\r\n\r\nif  we  have  a  second ballot next year  with  the\r\n\r\nincreased  prices,  those who  buy  in  the  second\r\n\r\nballot  will  grumble. They  will  point  to  their\r\n\r\nneighbours  next  door and say, \"That  person  paid\r\n\r\n$2,000  or  $4,000  less.\" This  policy  is  not  a\r\n\r\npleasant one. But unless we increase the prices  of\r\n\r\nflats,  it  will  be uneconomical for  the  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  and  the  Minister for Finance  to  increase\r\n\r\nconsiderably  the  subsidies  that  Government   is\r\n\r\nalready providing for cheap low-cost housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  did  say  that  he  would  consider\r\n\r\nincreasing  the quantum of compensation for  people\r\n\r\naffected by urban renewal, and he also said that he\r\n\r\nwould  consider it when the time is  ripe.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  time  is  ripe now.  Will  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconsider increasing the compensation especially for\r\n\r\nthose  people who have just been affected by  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  sometime  in  August,  as  they  will   be\r\n\r\nobtaining  their flats after January? The increased\r\n\r\ncompensation  can help them meet  the  extra  costs\r\n\r\nthat are to be charged for Housing Board flats with\r\n\r\neffect from 1st January, 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I will have to work out the details.\r\n\r\nAll   I  can  say  is  that  it  is  unlikely  that\r\n\r\ncompensation rates will be increased by the end  of\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H.

In  recent  months,  Singapore,  like\r\n\r\nother  countries in this region, has suffered  from\r\n\r\nhigh rice and bread prices because of poor harvests\r\n\r\nand  export bans by producing countries, themselves\r\n\r\nshort of such supplies. The recent Middle East  War\r\n\r\nhas  led to crude oil shortages. Unless the  supply\r\n\r\nsituation  improves, crude oil shortages will  lead\r\n\r\nto   reduced   supplies  of  petrol,   fertilisers,\r\n\r\nplastics  and other petroleum products. There  will\r\n\r\nalso be a slowdown in the production of high energy\r\n\r\ncontent  manufactured  goods,  such  as  steel  and\r\n\r\ncement.  Shortages  of essential  commodities  will\r\n\r\ndislocate  all economies, including  our  own  very\r\n\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current economic uncertainty, all that\r\n\r\nSingapore can do is to take steps to reduce adverse\r\n\r\neffects  as  far  as  possible. The  Government  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  raising the rice stockpile  from  25,000\r\n\r\ntons  to  90,000 tons, sufficient for at least  six\r\n\r\nmonths' consumption. While there appears to be some\r\n\r\nimprovement  in the world food grains situation,  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  rice stockpile still appears  to  be  a\r\n\r\nprudent  precaution. Six months' stocks  will  tide\r\n\r\nSingapore  over should harvests fail and  shortages\r\n\r\noccur again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Government and the oil industry are\r\n\r\ntaking  steps  to  safeguard  oil  stocks  to  meet\r\n\r\nSingapore's  own direct needs and also  to  supply,\r\n\r\nwith  bunker  fuel  and  aviation  gas,  ships  and\r\n\r\ninternational   airlines   calling   regularly   at\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However,  crude  oil  supplies  to  our\r\n\r\nrefineries  have  been  reduced  and  it  will   be\r\n\r\nnecessary for all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore households, industries and business firms\r\n\r\nto  exercise the greatest economy in the use of oil\r\n\r\nand  electricity. While Government will do its best\r\n\r\nto  ensure  security  of supplies,  Singapore,  not\r\n\r\nbeing  a  producer  of rice nor  of  oil  or  other\r\n\r\nprimary  products,  will have  to  pay  competitive\r\n\r\nprices   in   the   international   market   place.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, supplies to Singapore would just dry up.\r\n\r\nSo  long  as we can pay internationally-competitive\r\n\r\nprices,  adequate,  if  perhaps  because  of   more\r\n\r\nrestricted  production, somewhat  reduced  supplies\r\n\r\nwill  keep flowing and our economy will be able  to\r\n\r\nfunction,   though   it  may  grow   more   slowly.\r\n\r\nInternational  events  can, however,  take  a  turn\r\n\r\nswiftly for the worse, entirely outside Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontrol.  Should  there be a  rapid  deterioration,\r\n\r\nthere   could  be  actual  shortages  of  essential\r\n\r\ncommodities for Singapore. In such a situation,  it\r\n\r\nwould be the duty of Government to ensure fair  and\r\n\r\nequitable distribution of scarce commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Control of Essential Supplies Bill, 1973,\r\n\r\nwhen   enacted  will  give  Government  powers   to\r\n\r\ncontrol,  including  possibly  by  rationing,   the\r\n\r\ndomestic  sale  of  essential  commodities.  These,\r\n\r\nhowever, are emergency powers to be exercised  only\r\n\r\nwhen the situation demands, and then only with  the\r\n\r\nconsent of the President. The Minister, on his own,\r\n\r\nwill not be able to invoke such powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to stress that this Bill will\r\n\r\nregulate   the   distribution  only  of   essential\r\n\r\ncommodities  and  not  of any  other  article.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  no intention and, indeed,  it  can\r\n\r\nhave no effective means of regulating domestic  and\r\n\r\ninternational trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to repeat that these are\r\n\r\nemergency  powers which will enable  Government  to\r\n\r\nact firmly and decisively in a crisis. There are no\r\n\r\nindications  as  yet that stocks of  any  essential\r\n\r\ncommodities  will  fall  to  critical  levels.  The\r\n\r\npublic should therefore not allow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthemselves   to   be   panicked  into   unnecessary\r\n\r\npurchases  at excessively high prices.  The  public\r\n\r\nshould  treat  rumours  of  shortages  with   great\r\n\r\nscepticism.   If  they  allow  themselves   to   be\r\n\r\npersuaded  by such rumours, they run the danger  of\r\n\r\nbringing  about  the situations they  fear  and  of\r\n\r\nbenefiting  those who, in the first place  and  for\r\n\r\ntheir own purposes, started these rumours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just a small\r\n\r\npoint of clarification.

It  has\r\n\r\nbeen found that the present method and procedure of\r\n\r\nrevising   the   registers   of   electors   causes\r\n\r\nunnecessary  delay because of the requirement  laid\r\n\r\ndown  by  section 16 of the Parliamentary Elections\r\n\r\nAct  that,  apart from the revised  registers,  two\r\n\r\nadditional  lists referred to as \"List A\"  (dealing\r\n\r\nwith  deletions from the registers)  and  \"List  B\"\r\n\r\n(dealing with additions to the registers) must also\r\n\r\nbe  prepared. The preparation of both  these  Lists\r\n\r\ntakes  time but serves very little purpose as  they\r\n\r\nare  hardly known to the public, most of  whom  are\r\n\r\nmerely  interested  in finding  out  whether  their\r\n\r\nnames  are in the revised registers or not.  Clause\r\n\r\n10  of  the  Bill, therefore, dispenses  with  this\r\n\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been found that the existing section\r\n\r\n15  of  the  Act is unduly rigid as  it  imposes  a\r\n\r\nmandatory  requirement to revise the  registers  of\r\n\r\nelectors  every year even though there may  not  be\r\n\r\nany  real need for such revision. Clause 9  of  the\r\n\r\nBill, therefore, seeks to amend section 15 so as to\r\n\r\nintroduce greater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflexibility by empowering the Minister  to  require\r\n\r\nthe  registers of electors to be revised from  time\r\n\r\nto  time but in any case not less than three  years\r\n\r\nafter the last general election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the shorter time that will be\r\n\r\nneeded  in preparing revised registers of electors,\r\n\r\nthe  cut-off date for the inclusion of names in the\r\n\r\nregisters  can  be extended from  1st  February  at\r\n\r\npresent to 1st July in any year in respect of which\r\n\r\nregisters are prepared. Clause 2 of the Bill, which\r\n\r\namends section 5 of the Act, seeks to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past it has also been the practice to amend\r\n\r\nsection  10 of the Act whenever fresh registers  of\r\n\r\nelectors  (as distinct from revised registers)  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  be  prepared for a general  election.\r\n\r\nThis   method   is   somewhat  unsatisfactory   and\r\n\r\ncumbersome,  and  clause 3 of the Bill  now  simply\r\n\r\nprovides  that,  whenever a  notification  is  made\r\n\r\nunder section 8 of the Act to specify the names and\r\n\r\nboundaries of the electoral divisions for  purposes\r\n\r\nof  a  general  election, the Registration  Officer\r\n\r\nwill  prepare fresh registers of electors for  that\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains one other important amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  seeks to increase the amount required to  be\r\n\r\ndeposited by a candidate for election from $500  to\r\n\r\n$1,200. The amendment, which is contained in clause\r\n\r\n14,  will  also empower the Minister  to  vary  the\r\n\r\namount of deposit up to a maximum of 10 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  total  allowances  payable  to  a  Member   of\r\n\r\nParliament   in  each  year.  This   amendment   is\r\n\r\nnecessary because the present amount of deposit was\r\n\r\nfixed as long ago as 1954 and is therefore somewhat\r\n\r\nunrealistic by present day standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 14 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a correction to be made:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6 (Form 3), to insert line 14 below line 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This will be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROHIBITION ON SMOKING IN CERTAIN PLACES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to prohibit smoking in public\r\n\r\nbuses.  I  do  not  need to go into  the  whys  and\r\n\r\nwherefores  for  prohibition on smoking  in  public\r\n\r\nplaces.  Members  are  well  aware  of  these.  The\r\n\r\nProhibition on Smoking in Certain Places  Act  came\r\n\r\ninto  operation on 1st October, 1970,  followed  by\r\n\r\nprohibition  on  smoking in cinemas,  theatres  and\r\n\r\nsimilar  public places. More recently,  smoking  in\r\n\r\npublic  lifts  was also prohibited  in  March  this\r\n\r\nyear. About 1.75 million bus trips are made by fare-paying  passengers, including school  children,  in\r\n\r\none   day.   It  is  therefore  logical  that   the\r\n\r\nprohibition on smoking in public places  should  be\r\n\r\nextended to public buses to give these passengers a\r\n\r\nbetter  atmosphere to travel in  and  protect  them\r\n\r\nfrom the harmful effects of smoking by others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of this Bill, the present\r\n\r\ndivision  in public buses between smoking and  non-smoking  sections  will be  done  away  with.  Each\r\n\r\npublic bus will be wholly non-smoking. The prohibition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non smoking in buses would apply to  buses\r\n\r\noperating on scheduled routes while carrying  fare-paying  passengers.  Excursion  and  private  buses\r\n\r\nwould not be included in the prohibition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill empowers the conductor or a ticket\r\n\r\ninspector  to  warn passengers against  smoking  in\r\n\r\nbuses. A passenger who disregards such warning  may\r\n\r\nbe  asked to leave the bus. The conductor or ticket\r\n\r\ninspector  may  also  seek the  assistance  of  any\r\n\r\npolice  officer, public health auxiliary  or  other\r\n\r\npublic  officer  authorised by the Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nPublic Health, to deal with a passenger who refuses\r\n\r\nto heed the warnings or leave the bus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, smoking in public buses would be\r\n\r\nan  offence  subject to arrest without warning.  On\r\n\r\nconviction in Court, an offender would be liable to\r\n\r\na fine of up to $500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Ang Kok Peng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a correction to be made:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 5, to leave out \"Act,\" and insert \"Act;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This will be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthere can be no appeal by the Public Prosecutor  in\r\n\r\nrespect of sentence imposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas there are these restrictions on the Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor, there are no corresponding restrictions\r\n\r\non  the accused person who, upon conviction by  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court,  is entitled as of right to  take  his\r\n\r\ncase on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal; and\r\n\r\nin  every  case where he is dissatisfied  with  the\r\n\r\nsort  of punishment meted out on him by the  Court,\r\n\r\nlodge  an  appeal  against sentence.

The\r\n\r\nBill  therefore seeks to amend and consolidate  the\r\n\r\nexisting  law and to repeal Part III of  the  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment Integration Act (Cap. 210) dealing  with\r\n\r\nbuilding activities. The general scheme of the Bill\r\n\r\nis  similar  to  Part III of the  Local  Government\r\n\r\nIntegration Act, but substantive changes have  been\r\n\r\nmade  to  simplify  the law and to  confer  greater\r\n\r\npowers  on  the Building Authority (who is  defined\r\n\r\nunder  the Bill as the Assistant Director (Building\r\n\r\nControl) of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.W.D.)  to  deal with unauthorised building  works\r\n\r\nand  dangerous or dilapidated buildings.  Penalties\r\n\r\nfor  offences in relation to unauthorised  building\r\n\r\nworks  have been increased under the Bill,  as  the\r\n\r\npresent penalties are considered inadequate.  There\r\n\r\nare also other new provisions which will strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of  the  Authority. I  will  only  draw\r\n\r\nMembers'  attention to some of the more significant\r\n\r\nclauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides that no person shall commence\r\n\r\nor carry out any building works without the written\r\n\r\npermission of the Building Authority. This  is  not\r\n\r\nnew. But \"building works\" is defined to include any\r\n\r\nkind  of  construction,  site  formation,  repairs,\r\n\r\ndemolition, alteration, addition and every kind  of\r\n\r\nbuilding operations. Provisions will be made in the\r\n\r\nRegulations to exempt minor repairs and alterations\r\n\r\nfrom the requirements of this clause. In respect of\r\n\r\nany  unauthorised building works, the Authority  is\r\n\r\nauthorised  under  the  Bill  to  charge  sums  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  50  times the prescribed fees,  for  the\r\n\r\napproval of plans to cover such unauthorised works.\r\n\r\nThe  existing  maximum penalty  is  ten  times  the\r\n\r\nprescribed fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 which is substantially similar to the\r\n\r\nexisting law confers on the Authority power to stop\r\n\r\nthe construction of unauthorised building works and\r\n\r\nto  demolish the structures and to recover the cost\r\n\r\nand   expenses  of  demolition  from  the   persons\r\n\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 empowers the Authority to enter a\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  seize  all  movable  property  found\r\n\r\ntherein  if  it is satisfied that the building  has\r\n\r\nbeen  converted for any purpose or use  other  than\r\n\r\nthe  purpose or use for which the building has been\r\n\r\napproved.  Such movable property may be confiscated\r\n\r\nor  returned to the owner. This clause is  designed\r\n\r\nto  enable speedy and effective action to be  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  any  unauthorised  change  of  use  of   a\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill confers wide powers on the\r\n\r\nAuthority to deal with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany building which is dangerous or liable to become\r\n\r\ndangerous  by fire, wind, rain, dilapidation,  use,\r\n\r\nlack  of  fire  escapes or any other  cause.

In view of the present high cost  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  construction materials, these people  may\r\n\r\nvery  well find three months too short a period  to\r\n\r\nraise  sufficient money to replace the  attap  roof\r\n\r\nwith  other suitable material. In cases of  genuine\r\n\r\nfinancial  hardship, I do hope that the  Department\r\n\r\nwill  be prepared to grant a longer period for  the\r\n\r\nwork to be carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that has occurred to me is that the\r\n\r\nexisting procedure to obtain official permission to\r\n\r\nchange  the  roof from attap to some other  hardier\r\n\r\nmaterial is somewhat involved, and in most cases it\r\n\r\ntakes  more  than  three months to obtain  planning\r\n\r\napproval. So, for this clause 11 to be implemented,\r\n\r\nI  presume that something will be done to  simplify\r\n\r\nthe procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding, Sir, I do like to mention that I\r\n\r\ncan fully appreciate the very good intention behind\r\n\r\nthis particular clause of the Bill, which obviously\r\n\r\naims  at minimising the risk of fire spreading from\r\n\r\nhouse to house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, first, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMember for his kind remarks.

This\r\n\r\nis an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, extremely difficult to secure\r\n\r\nconvictions  under this provision  because  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  adducing evidence to  prove  beyond\r\n\r\nreasonable  doubt that the defendant is engaged  in\r\n\r\nthe  business of trafficking illegal immigrants  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. Between 1970 and June 1973,  of  the  88\r\n\r\ntraffickers  arrested only 35  were  prosecuted  in\r\n\r\ncourt. The other 53 were not charged because it was\r\n\r\nnot  possible  to  adduce the  amount  of  evidence\r\n\r\nrequired for a conviction in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate proof, clause 2 (c) of the\r\n\r\nBill   therefore   seeks  to  introduce   a   legal\r\n\r\npresumption   to  provide  that   where,   in   any\r\n\r\nproceeding  for  an offence of trafficking,  it  is\r\n\r\nproved   that   the  defendant  has  conveyed   any\r\n\r\nprohibited  illegal immigrant in or on any  vessel,\r\n\r\naircraft  or  vehicle, it shall be presumed,  until\r\n\r\nthe contrary is proved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  defendant is engaged in the business  or\r\n\r\ntrade   of   conveying   to  Singapore   prohibited\r\n\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for trafficking illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nunder  the existing law is imprisonment for a  term\r\n\r\nof  two  years  and  a fine not  exceeding  $4,000.\r\n\r\nFurther a person who enters Singapore illegally and\r\n\r\nany  person  who  abets his entry  or  harbours  or\r\n\r\nemploys   him   is   liable,  on   conviction,   to\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term not exceeding one  year  or\r\n\r\nto  a  fine  not exceeding $4,000 or to  both  such\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and fine. These penalties  under  the\r\n\r\npresent  law  are manifestly inadequate  especially\r\n\r\nfor   traffickers   who  prey  on   these   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the number of illegal immigrants\r\n\r\narrested  since  1969  has  been  increasing.   The\r\n\r\nnumbers arrested in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972  were\r\n\r\n902,  1,128, 1,002 and 1,554 respectively.  In  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half of this year, that is, from January  to\r\n\r\nJune   1973   alone,  there  were   1,086   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants arrested. These figures, however, do not\r\n\r\nreveal the true position as there are most probably\r\n\r\nmany  more  illegal immigrants who have up  to-date\r\n\r\nremained undetected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the Immigration\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill is to give more teeth to  the  law\r\n\r\nso  that  it  will  be  a deterrent  especially  to\r\n\r\ntraffickers and to those who abet another person to\r\n\r\nenter Singapore unlawfully, or to harbour or employ\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants. We must enhance  penalties  to\r\n\r\nensure  that it does not pay especially to  traffic\r\n\r\nin illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (a) (i) of the Bill therefore seeks to\r\n\r\nincrease   the   penalties   for   traffickers   to\r\n\r\nimprisonment for a term of not less than two  years\r\n\r\nand  not  more than five years and to  a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $10,000  and to  caning.  Thus  for  the\r\n\r\noffence  of  trafficking, a  minimum  sentence  and\r\n\r\nmandatory caning are introduced for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment for any person who enters\r\n\r\nunlawfully,  or any person who abets his  entry  or\r\n\r\nharbours  or employs him, is raised to imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor a term not exceeding two years or to a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfine   not   exceeding  $6,000  or  to  both   such\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and  fine. This is  provided  for  in\r\n\r\nclause 2 (a) (ii) of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Committee stage I shall be moving a\r\n\r\nfurther  amendment to sections  2  and  49  of  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Act. This amendment is to provide  for\r\n\r\nthe  seizure, detention and forfeiture of  vehicles\r\n\r\nused  in  the commission of any offence  under  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Act. This is necessary  because  under\r\n\r\nexisting  provisions, although there  is  power  to\r\n\r\nseize, detain or forfeit vessels below 75 tons used\r\n\r\nin  the  commission of any offence under  the  Act,\r\n\r\nthere  are no similar provisions for vehicles.

In 1972,  20,208\r\n\r\nseizable offences were committed in the Republic as\r\n\r\nagainst   15,752  in  1962.  This  represented   an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  4,456 cases, or 22.1  per  cent.  The\r\n\r\naverage number of seizable offences committed  over\r\n\r\nthe last ten years, that is, between 1962 and 1972,\r\n\r\nwas   19,776.  However,  the  number  of   seizable\r\n\r\noffences  for  the years 1970, 197] and  1972  were\r\n\r\n19,835,  22,564 and 20,208 respectively. There  are\r\n\r\nno  signs that this upward trend has abated for, in\r\n\r\nthe first six months of this year, the number\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  reported seizable offences was 10,611. If  this\r\n\r\nrate   continues,  the  total  number  of  seizable\r\n\r\noffences for 1973 should be well over 20,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, robbery is one of the prevalent\r\n\r\noffences  in the Republic. The number has increased\r\n\r\nsharply  in recent years. In 1968 there were  1,067\r\n\r\ncases  of  robbery. But within a  period  of  three\r\n\r\nyears  this  figure has doubled for in  1971  there\r\n\r\nwere 2,146 cases and in 1972 there were 1,715 cases\r\n\r\nof  robbery.  But what is disturbing is  the  rapid\r\n\r\nincrease  of  robbery cases in Singapore  in  which\r\n\r\noffensive  weapons were used. These  are  known  as\r\n\r\narmed  robberies. In 1969 there were 473  cases  of\r\n\r\narmed  robbery  out of a total of 1,009  robberies.\r\n\r\nThis works out to 46.9 per cent. In 1970 the number\r\n\r\nincreased to 821 Out of a total of 1,379 robberies.\r\n\r\nThis  works out to 59.5 per cent. There were  1,124\r\n\r\ncases  of  armed robbery in 1971 out of a total  of\r\n\r\n2,146 robberies and in 1972 there were 939 cases of\r\n\r\narmed robbery out of a total of 1,715 robberies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offensive weapons used in these robberies\r\n\r\ninclude firearms, knives, bearing scrapers  or  any\r\n\r\nsharp  instruments.  This  clearly  indicates  that\r\n\r\ncrimes  of  violence  have  become  wide-spread  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. What is even more alarming is  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  robberies in which firearms  have  been\r\n\r\nused has also increased sharply. In 1971 there were\r\n\r\n93  robberies in which firearms were used,  and  in\r\n\r\n1972  firearms were used in 79 robberies.  However,\r\n\r\nin  the  first  half of 1973 alone there  were  127\r\n\r\nrobberies  where  firearms were  used.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nstaggering  increase over last year's figure.  This\r\n\r\nworks  out  to about an average of 21  robberies  a\r\n\r\nmonth,  involving firearms. It has therefore become\r\n\r\nvital  and urgent that something drastic should  be\r\n\r\ndone  to  curb this widespread use of  firearms  if\r\n\r\npeace  and  good  order in our Republic  is  to  be\r\n\r\nmaintained.  It is well known that  those  who  use\r\n\r\nfirearms  in  the  commission of criminal  offences\r\n\r\nwhen  resisted do not hesitate to open fire to maim\r\n\r\nor to kill their victims. They have even less hesitation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  open fire at the police when  they  are\r\n\r\nconfronted. Some even shoot to kill in cold  blood.\r\n\r\nHon.  Members may recall the incident in the middle\r\n\r\nof  this year of the detective police constable who\r\n\r\nintervened in a dispute between a bus driver and  a\r\n\r\nmotorist at Katong. The motorist turned out  to  be\r\n\r\none of the top 10 criminals in the wanted list.  He\r\n\r\npulled out his gun and in cold blood shot twice  at\r\n\r\nthe  detective constable. He then relieved  him  of\r\n\r\nhis  service revolver and calmly walked away.  This\r\n\r\nyear   the  Police  Force  lost  two  of  its  best\r\n\r\nofficers,  shot  dead  in  two  separate   shooting\r\n\r\nincidents.   Early  this  year,  the  police   also\r\n\r\nuncovered  a  big-time syndicate for  the  hire  of\r\n\r\nfirearms  to  thugs  for use in the  commission  of\r\n\r\ncriminal offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this grave threat from this\r\n\r\nwidespread  use  of firearms in the  commission  of\r\n\r\ncriminal offences, it was clear that the Government\r\n\r\nhad  to find an effective deterrent to this growing\r\n\r\nmenace.  It  was also clear that the law pertaining\r\n\r\nto  the  use  of  firearms  in  the  commission  of\r\n\r\noffences  had  to  be  amended  to  strengthen  its\r\n\r\nprovisions  and to enhance punishment  so  that  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  an effective deterrent. Hence  you  have\r\n\r\nbefore you this Arms Offences Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, to give hon. Members a preview of its\r\n\r\ndeterrent  effect, let me give the figures  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of robberies involving the use of  firearms\r\n\r\nafter  the Bill was introduced in August this  year\r\n\r\nas  compared  with  the  figures  previous  to  its\r\n\r\nintroduction.   For  the  three-month   period   of\r\n\r\nSeptember to November 1973, that is, after the Bill\r\n\r\nwas introduced and its provisions publicised, there\r\n\r\nwere  only  14 cases of robbery involving firearms.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other  hand, from January to August  1973,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a period of eight months, there  were  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  155  robberies involving firearms.  This\r\n\r\nsharp   decline  in  the  incidence  of   robberies\r\n\r\ninvolving  the use of firearms after the  Bill  was\r\n\r\nintroduced in August was quite dramatic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Arms Offences Bill makes it an\r\n\r\noffence punishable with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeath  for any person who uses or attempts  to  use\r\n\r\nany  arms  with  intent to maim or  cause  physical\r\n\r\ninjury  to the victim. \"Arm\" is defined to  include\r\n\r\nfirearm,  air-gun, bomb or grenade, etc. Under  the\r\n\r\nexisting Arms Offences Act, which it is proposed to\r\n\r\nrepeal,  the  court can either punish the  offender\r\n\r\nwith death or with imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, which is a new provision, provides the\r\n\r\nsame  punishment for an accomplice of a person who,\r\n\r\nwhen   committing  or  attempting  to  commit   any\r\n\r\noffence,  uses  an arm provided the accomplice  was\r\n\r\npresent  at  the  scene  of  the  offence  and  may\r\n\r\nreasonably  be  presumed to  have  known  that  the\r\n\r\nperson who had used the arm was carrying it or  had\r\n\r\nit  in  his  possession. This clause  provides  for\r\n\r\njoint liability on accomplices without the need  to\r\n\r\nprove common intention on their part to use the arm\r\n\r\nwhich  would otherwise be necessary if sections  34\r\n\r\nand 149 of the Penal Code arc to be invoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 provides as penalties death or\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for life plus caning for  any  person\r\n\r\ntrafficking  in arms. Any person proved  to  be  in\r\n\r\nunlawful  possession of more than two  arms  shall,\r\n\r\nuntil  the  contrary is proved, be presumed  to  be\r\n\r\ntrafficking  in arms. This is a new  provision.  At\r\n\r\npresent  persons  trafficking  in  arms  are   only\r\n\r\nheavily fined or imprisoned for possession of arms.\r\n\r\nSuch punishment is manifestly inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to make a person, who consorts\r\n\r\nwith  or is found in the company of another  person\r\n\r\nwho  is  unlawfully  carrying  or  is  in  unlawful\r\n\r\npossession  of  any arm, guilty of an  offence  and\r\n\r\nliable  to  the same punishment as the person  with\r\n\r\nwhom  he was consorting or in whose company he  was\r\n\r\nfound,  if  the  circumstances raise  a  reasonable\r\n\r\npresumption that he knew that such other person was\r\n\r\ncarrying or had in his possession such arm. This is\r\n\r\nanother  new provision. It is similar in nature  to\r\n\r\nclause  5  and  provides  for  joint  liability  on\r\n\r\naccomplices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 proposes penalties for exhibiting any\r\n\r\nimitation arm in a manner likely to put any  person\r\n\r\nin  fear  of  death  or  hurt  when  committing  or\r\n\r\nattempting to commit or abetting the commission  of\r\n\r\nany  scheduled  offence.  This  new  provision   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  as imitation arms are nowadays  so  well\r\n\r\nmade  that unless they are closely examined, it  is\r\n\r\nquite  impossible  to  distinguish  them  from  the\r\n\r\ngenuine  ones.  The degree of intimidation  on  the\r\n\r\nvictim is therefore equally grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 seeks to make the occupier of any\r\n\r\npremises  in  which  any arm  is  found  guilty  of\r\n\r\npossession of such arm unless he proves  that  some\r\n\r\nother person was in possession of it or that he had\r\n\r\nno  knowledge  or reasonable means of knowing  that\r\n\r\nsuch  arm was in the premises and that he had taken\r\n\r\nall  reasonable precautions against such arm  being\r\n\r\nkept in his premises. This is also a new provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, caning is made mandatory in\r\n\r\nrespect  of all offences except in cases where  the\r\n\r\noffence is punishable with death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, as I have stated in a speech\r\n\r\nbefore,  in  our  system of  criminal  justice  the\r\n\r\nraison  d'etre of it is that criminal elements  are\r\n\r\ndetected  and apprehended and through a combination\r\n\r\nof  punitive and rehabilitative measures  they  are\r\n\r\nreturned  to society in a condition whereby  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped  they  are  more amenable to abiding  by  the\r\n\r\nsocial  norms  and  restraints  necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of  organised  society.  This  work   of\r\n\r\nensuring  justice  is performed by  three  distinct\r\n\r\nagencies. They are the police, the courts  and  the\r\n\r\nprisons. Any inadequacy or weakness on the part  of\r\n\r\nany one of the agencies must necessarily jeopardise\r\n\r\nthe  objective of the entire system. As far as  the\r\n\r\ncourts  are  concerned,  the  sentences  that  they\r\n\r\nimpose must be adequate so as not only to act as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  to  repeat offenders but also  to  deter\r\n\r\nothers  as well. This is particularly important  in\r\n\r\ncases of serious crimes and crimes of violence.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  ensure  this, the  relevant  laws  where\r\n\r\nnecessary must and will be amended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.

To  them  I  think  the   extreme\r\n\r\npunishment  is  something which they will  probably\r\n\r\nunderstand.  Anything less than that  will  not  be\r\n\r\neffective.

I also spoke of the urgent need to make  use\r\n\r\nof  the  element  of deterrence to  help  cut  down\r\n\r\ncrime, especially crimes of violence in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, besides firearms, other offensive\r\n\r\nweapons  are  also being used in the commission  of\r\n\r\ncrime, particularly robberies. Armed with offensive\r\n\r\nweapons  like  knives, bearing  scrapers  or  other\r\n\r\nsharp  objects,  the  robbers  would  waylay  their\r\n\r\nvictims  in some quiet street or backlane, or  hold\r\n\r\nthem  up  in their premises, rob them and disappear\r\n\r\nquickly.  Most  victims invariably  do  not  resist\r\n\r\nbecause  they  fear injury or being killed.  It  is\r\n\r\nwell  known  that  these thugs who carry  offensive\r\n\r\nweapons  will not hesitate when resisted  to  cause\r\n\r\ngrievous hurt to their victims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our records show that these crimes of violence\r\n\r\nwhether  they  be  armed robbery occurring  in  the\r\n\r\nstreets,  or in taxis, or extortions, intimidations\r\n\r\nand gang clashes by secret society thugs are on the\r\n\r\nincrease. Hon. Members will remember that  not  too\r\n\r\nlong ago an example of a blatantly inhuman act  was\r\n\r\nperpetrated by thugs on a boy of 14 years  when  he\r\n\r\nwas set fire upon after kerosene was poured on him.\r\n\r\nI  understand that this boy is now emasculated  and\r\n\r\nhis  whole  appearance is quite hideous.  Our  law-abiding  members of the public have to be protected\r\n\r\nfrom  this  growing threat of brutal  assaults  and\r\n\r\ngrievous hurt being inflicted upon them apart  from\r\n\r\nbeing robbed by these violent thugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police have the responsibility of ensuring\r\n\r\npeace and good order of our Republic as well as the\r\n\r\npersonal  safety  of  our  citizens.  However,   in\r\n\r\ndischarging these duties, the Police have often  to\r\n\r\nface  dangers  of attack and assault  from  violent\r\n\r\ncriminals. These thugs have no hesitation in  using\r\n\r\nforce   and   violence  against  the  Police   when\r\n\r\nconfronted  or  in  resisting arrest.  Members  may\r\n\r\nrecall  the brutal assault on two Police constables\r\n\r\nby a mob in a firecracker incident in February last\r\n\r\nyear. The constables were discharging their duty to\r\n\r\nenforce  the  firecracker ban. One of them  was  so\r\n\r\nbrutally  assaulted  and  sustained  such   serious\r\n\r\ninjuries  that he now exists almost  as  a  \"living\r\n\r\nvegetable\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1972, a total of 31 Police officers were\r\n\r\nassaulted  by thugs in the course of their  duties.\r\n\r\nOf  these, eight Police officers (or 25.7 per cent)\r\n\r\nwere  injured  or  killed by the use  of  offensive\r\n\r\nweapons  or  firearms. Thus  apart  from  our  law-abiding  members of the public, our law enforcement\r\n\r\nofficers  who undertake risks in discharging  their\r\n\r\nduties  must also be protected from being  brutally\r\n\r\nassaulted  by  thugs. There is an  urgent  need  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  penalties for  the  various  offences\r\n\r\nunder  the Penal Code so that they will  act  as  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  to offenders from maiming or  inflicting\r\n\r\nhurt on any person\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether he is a member of the public or any  public\r\n\r\nofficer who is discharging his duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill proposes to increase the\r\n\r\nmaximum  punishment for rioting with violence  from\r\n\r\ntwo  years  to  five  years,  and  caning  is  made\r\n\r\nmandatory.  Clause 3 further provides that  if  any\r\n\r\narms or offensive weapons are used which are likely\r\n\r\nto   cause  death,  this  offence  will   be   made\r\n\r\npunishable  with  imprisonment of seven  years  and\r\n\r\ncaning,  instead  of  three  years  and/or  a  fine\r\n\r\npresently  provided in section  148  of  the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill any person found guilty of\r\n\r\nobstructing  a public servant from discharging  his\r\n\r\nduties   with  intimidation  or  assault  will   be\r\n\r\npunished  with  imprisonment of up  to  six  years,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  three years as presently  provided  in\r\n\r\nsection 152 of the Penal Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if the offender inflicts hurt to\r\n\r\nprevent  a  public  servant from carrying  out  his\r\n\r\nduties, he will be punished with imprisonment of up\r\n\r\nto  five  years,  instead of three years  presently\r\n\r\nprovided under section 332 of the Penal Code. He is\r\n\r\nalso  liable to be caned for this offence.  If  the\r\n\r\npublic  servant  sustains grievous hurt,  then  the\r\n\r\noffender will be punished with imprisonment  of  up\r\n\r\nto 10 years in addition to caning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important amendment involves offences\r\n\r\nagainst the person. Under clause 7 of the Bill, any\r\n\r\nperson  who  voluntarily  causes  hurt  to  another\r\n\r\nperson  by  the  use of dangerous  weapons  or  any\r\n\r\ncorrosive substance likely to cause death  will  be\r\n\r\nimprisoned  up  to  five years,  instead  of  three\r\n\r\nyears. If this offence results in grievous hurt  to\r\n\r\nthe person, under clause 8 of the Bill he is liable\r\n\r\nto imprisonment for seven years and caning as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to make caning mandatory for\r\n\r\nrobbery and robbery with hurt. Under clauses 14  to\r\n\r\n16  of the Bill these offences are punishable  with\r\n\r\ncaning  of not less than four strokes to  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  six  strokes in addition to the  imprisonment\r\n\r\nterm already provided in the Penal Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese  offences  will no longer  be  punishable  by\r\n\r\nimposition of a fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a robbery, if an offender is armed or uses any\r\n\r\ndeadly weapon to cause grievous hurt or attempt  to\r\n\r\ncause death to any person, the punishment for  this\r\n\r\noffence is increased under clause 19 of the Bill by\r\n\r\ncaning with not less than 10 strokes in addition to\r\n\r\nthe term of imprisonment already provided under the\r\n\r\nrelevant section of the Penal Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for gang robbery are also enhanced.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Bill  any person who commits gang  robbery\r\n\r\nwill be punished with imprisonment for life or with\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for  a term of up  to  10  years.  In\r\n\r\naddition  he  is liable to be caned with  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  six  strokes of the rotan.

However,  if  the\r\n\r\npunishment is other than death, clause  18  of  the\r\n\r\nBill provides that they be caned with not less than\r\n\r\n10  strokes,  instead of imposition of  a  fine  as\r\n\r\nprovided in section 396 of the Penal Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 401 and 402 of the Penal Code, which\r\n\r\nprovide   punishment  for  persons  who  habitually\r\n\r\ncommit  gang  robbery  or  theft,  are  amended  to\r\n\r\nprovide   for  mandatory  caning  in  addition   to\r\n\r\nimprisonment.

Sir, the\r\n\r\nBill  as  now  tabled before the House incorporates\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations of the Select  Committee.  The\r\n\r\nCommittee  held three meetings and has recommended,\r\n\r\ninter  alia, the following amendments to the Bills:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An amendment to clause 15 of the Bill to\r\n\r\nprovide  that it shall be one of the functions  and\r\n\r\nduties  of  the  Urban Redevelopment  Authority  to\r\n\r\nsuperintend  parking places within the  meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe  Parking  Places Act (Chapter 90).  It  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  that  the Urban Redevelopment  Authority\r\n\r\nshould  upon its formation take over the  functions\r\n\r\nand   duties  of  the  Car  Parks  Division.   This\r\n\r\namendment  will  also  enable the  transfer,  under\r\n\r\nclause  12  of  the  Bill, of  the  Superintendent,\r\n\r\nofficers and staff of the Car Parks Division to the\r\n\r\nservice of the Urban Redevelopment Authority  which\r\n\r\nis necessary in order to effect the takeover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The amendment of clause 36 of the Bill to\r\n\r\ninclude amendments as proposed by the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nTitles. The amendments seek, inter alia, to obviate\r\n\r\nthe  need for the Urban Redevelopment Authority  to\r\n\r\nseek  its  remedy in court in order to  cancel  any\r\n\r\ninstrument  or assurance which has been erroneously\r\n\r\nregistered under the provisions of the Land  Titles\r\n\r\nAct  or  the Registration of Deeds Act contrary  to\r\n\r\nsub-clause  (3)  of clause 36 of  the  Bill  as  it\r\n\r\npreviously stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also provide that the Authority\r\n\r\nmay, in any case where an assurance, or a mortgage,\r\n\r\ntransfer, charge or lease has been executed without\r\n\r\nthe  written  consent  of the Authority,  lodge  an\r\n\r\ninstrument  with  the Registrar of  Titles  or  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Deeds as the case may  be,  for  the\r\n\r\nvesting  in the Authority of the title  to  or  the\r\n\r\nestate or interest in the unit in respect of  which\r\n\r\nthe  assurance, mortgage, transfer, charge or lease\r\n\r\nhad been executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The deletion of clauses 41 to 44 of the Bill\r\n\r\nand the substitution therefor of the new clauses 41\r\n\r\nto  44  as incorporated in the reprinted Bill which\r\n\r\nis  annexed  to  the  Report  as  Appendix  I.  The\r\n\r\ndeletion  of clauses 41 to 44 and the insertion  of\r\n\r\nthe  four  new  clauses 41 to 44 is  to  take  into\r\n\r\naccount the model provisions to be incorporated  in\r\n\r\nan  Act  of  Parliament when  establishing  a  body\r\n\r\ncorporate. The new clauses have been drafted on the\r\n\r\nadvice of the Auditor-General.
