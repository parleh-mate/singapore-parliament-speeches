I know that all hon. Members in this House\r\n\r\nas well as all right-thinking people of Singapore will\r\n\r\njoin us in such condemnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I certainly feel, Sir, that we do not only\r\n\r\ndeplore such a class of people but also the other side\r\n\r\nof those who are involved. I am referring to those who\r\n\r\nhave urged or who have been using such officials to\r\n\r\nmake them divulge such secret information. Those who\r\n\r\ncorrupt the civil servants are also guilty of that\r\n\r\noffence. Between the two, those who have bribed or have\r\n\r\nattempted to corrupt these people should deserve\r\n\r\ngreater punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many laws in Singapore concerning this. I\r\n\r\nknow that if a person should bribe a police constable\r\n\r\nand if that matter is reported, then that person too\r\n\r\nwill be punished by the law. I feel that, as this\r\n\r\nmatter is of such grave consequence, those who are\r\n\r\ninvolved should also be punished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information before us is that the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar has come forward with such information.\r\n\r\nWhere has he got the news? Who has been instrumental in\r\n\r\ngetting that news? Who has been edging on the civil\r\n\r\nservants to be disloyal to the Government which they\r\n\r\nserve?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it from higher officials who have had access to\r\n\r\nthe files, or was it, as alleged by the hon.

I\r\n\r\ndescribed  various possibilities but I did  not  allege\r\n\r\nhow  the  particular leakage of the information  coming\r\n\r\nout  from the Income Tax Department came about.  I  did\r\n\r\nnot allege any particular method by which it got out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am grateful for his\r\n\r\nexplanation, Sir. But whatever it is, this  concerns  a\r\n\r\nmatter  which, we would say, is top secret. The  people\r\n\r\nwho  have access to such files are few. People who have\r\n\r\ninfluence over such files are fewer still. We would say\r\n\r\nthat,  in  all probability, it might be those who  have\r\n\r\nalways  been passing information from one side  to  the\r\n\r\nother - from  the  Government side to the Opposition,  or\r\n\r\nfrom  one party to the other. That may be so. I am also\r\n\r\njust  suggesting a method whereby it may be leaked out.\r\n\r\nIf  such  were  so, it should be fully investigated.  I\r\n\r\npersonally have a very low opinion of those who indulge\r\n\r\nin  such  operations, if such men have no honour,  they\r\n\r\nshould be better out of the political field or even out\r\n\r\nof our own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have men who say that their whole life is devoted\r\n\r\ntowards promoting the welfare of Singapore. Now we have\r\n\r\ninformation that there are quite a number of people who\r\n\r\nare not. We demand complete loyalty even from those who\r\n\r\ncome  to live with us and want to become citizens.  Who\r\n\r\nwants  to  set examples to them? We want to  make  them\r\n\r\nfeel   that  they  are  following  leaders   who   have\r\n\r\nintegrity,  and  who are going to make them  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  living with leaders in whom  they  can  have\r\n\r\nfaith and to whom they can even close their eyes and be\r\n\r\nled  along.  But  if we have leaders  who  force  civil\r\n\r\nservants  who  have  all the time  been  loyal,  to  be\r\n\r\ndisloyal,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  have all the time been cheating on procedures when\r\n\r\nsecrecy  is essential, then such men. I would say,  are\r\n\r\nthe very scum of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Sir, that the Commission of Inquiry, when\r\n\r\nit inquires into this matter, should have this question\r\n\r\nforemost in their minds, to establish the identities of\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  made  possible the  leakage  of  such\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point, Sir, that I would like to mention is\r\n\r\nthat, on this side of the House, we want an inquiry. On\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition side, we have one Member  who  did  not\r\n\r\nwant  the  inquiry to carry on. Similarly, Sir,  during\r\n\r\nthe  sitting early this month-the 4th of March -we also\r\n\r\nhad  the  Opposition Party, the People's Action  Party,\r\n\r\ntaking  a  similar stand of wanting to have an  inquiry\r\n\r\nand  then  wanting to drop it. If a matter is  of  such\r\n\r\nimportance  that  a  Commission of  Inquiry  should  be\r\n\r\ncalled upon, then that inquiry should carry on.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot want just to indulge in speculation. We do not want\r\n\r\nto  establish any allegation where possibly there is no\r\n\r\ntruth. In an instance like this, Sir, we know that  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is wrong. It must be investigated and  we  must\r\n\r\nget  to the bottom of it. Similarly. Sir, in the  other\r\n\r\ninquiry  we know that it would be wrong not  to  pursue\r\n\r\nit,  because there could be innocent parties who  would\r\n\r\nbe  involved  and who would be blamed in this  Assembly\r\n\r\nwhere  there is privilege; but if they have an inquiry,\r\n\r\nthey may prove their innocence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring up this point, Sir, because I feel in the\r\n\r\nother  inquiry, too, allegations have been made  as  to\r\n\r\nhow  the  funds came about. But I would say, Sir,  like\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar, that there is no crime in\r\n\r\nreceiving  any  political gift. What  he  is  concerned\r\n\r\nabout  is  whether  the  funds came  from  any  foreign\r\n\r\nsources.  I  am certain that even if there was  such  a\r\n\r\ngift,  and  even if people did help the  former  Labour\r\n\r\nFront-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member was\r\n\r\ncorrect  up to the point where he mentioned the  former\r\n\r\ninquiry or the former motion in passing. But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  seems to be developing his argument on those  lines\r\n\r\nand,  of  course, he is going very, very far from  this\r\n\r\npresent motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am grateful for your guidance,\r\n\r\nSir, I was saying that the difference between those two\r\n\r\ncases is that we want to get at the truth. I have faith\r\n\r\nin all inquiries. In passing also. Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nmention  the  inquiry that looked into  the  matter  of\r\n\r\ncorrupt  practices,  involving  the  political  figures\r\n\r\nduring  the Cairnhill by-election. There, we find  that\r\n\r\nthe  inquiry  gave us a picture that  it  was  not  the\r\n\r\naccused  that was right. Neither the accused was  right\r\n\r\nnor  those who were accused were right, in fact,  there\r\n\r\nwas  blame  apportioned to so many people. Some  people\r\n\r\nmay  take  it that, after a court of inquiry, when  the\r\n\r\nfindings are not in their favour, that court of inquiry\r\n\r\nis  not  good.  But I am of the opinion  that  when  we\r\n\r\nappoint  a  court  of inquiry we must  abide  by  their\r\n\r\nfindings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain, Sir, that this court of inquiry when\r\n\r\nappointed  will  reveal many other  things  of  greater\r\n\r\ninterest  to the people of Singapore. It will also  expose a great deal of intrigue and false allegations  in\r\n\r\none  case,  and probably reveal the true  substance  of\r\n\r\nwhat we want to find in other cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this leakage I feel is not just a leakage. I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is also a system of spying amongst your  own\r\n\r\nfriends,  amongst your own people. If this system  were\r\n\r\nallowed to carry on and be fostered, there would  be  a\r\n\r\ntime  when we should not be able to speak to our  next-door neighbour nor even to our children. There would be\r\n\r\nno secret whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had instances of this in Singapore most\r\n\r\nrecently.  The rot is slowly setting in. We  must  stop\r\n\r\nthe  rot.  Cure it, or throw it out of Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nmethod alien to this land, as a method that will create\r\n\r\na lot of mistrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, Sir, in Singapore instances of people using\r\n\r\ntheir  political influence and asking their drivers  to\r\n\r\ngo against their employers when the employees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprobably  have  not  even a single complaint.  We  have\r\n\r\nagain, Sir, in unions, where spying is going on, giving\r\n\r\ninformation  to parties or political parties  that  are\r\n\r\nnot  in  their  favour or the unions, and  where  union\r\n\r\nofficials  get  into great trouble with  the  political\r\n\r\npower in the City Council. We have much more than that.\r\n\r\nThe  rot does not just end there. We have, even in  the\r\n\r\nmajor  political  parties in Singapore,  officials  who\r\n\r\nimpart information to Opposition members, telling  them\r\n\r\ntheir  inner secrets and giving them all the ammunition\r\n\r\nto shoot at the party they lead!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, Sir, demands absolute loyalty of its\r\n\r\ncitizens to the state. Anybody who is not loyal to this\r\n\r\nland  should  go to lands where their loyalty  belongs.\r\n\r\nBut  he  should not clothe himself in sheep's clothing,\r\n\r\nand  come and mingle with us to destroy us. This motion\r\n\r\nhas  arisen from the allegations made by the leader  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Action Party. They have much explanations\r\n\r\nto  offer to the people of Singapore. They have much to\r\n\r\nlet us know who those involved were. We do not want the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore just to stop thinking at the income\r\n\r\ntax  level of the inquiry. We want them to think  of\r\n\r\ntheir own lives, of the lives in the community, of  the\r\n\r\nfriends they have, of the children they have. Are  they\r\n\r\ngoing to have that spying system coming to Singapore to\r\n\r\ndestroy them? I am certain the people of Singapore will\r\n\r\ntake  this matter seriously. They must retain here what\r\n\r\nthey  have today and not go back to the time of Syonanto, as Singapore was called during the occupation, when\r\n\r\nthey were afraid. You were ruled by fear. You just  did\r\n\r\nnot  know  when  the  Kempeitai, the Japanese  Military\r\n\r\nPolice,  would  take  you away  from  your  home,  just\r\n\r\nbecause you inadvertently said something unpleasant  to\r\n\r\nthe ruling power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Sir, that it is time the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  wake  up  to  eradicate those  who  are  always\r\n\r\ninstigating  men  against men, race against  race,  and\r\n\r\ndoing a great disservice to this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inquiry must go on. The truth must be got\r\n\r\nat.  Whether  the truth is pleasant or unpleasant,  let\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  responsible for all  these  things  be\r\n\r\npunished most suitably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.18 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, it is\r\n\r\nsurprising that a Member from the Government back bench\r\n\r\nis  bringing  up the motion. In my opinion,  it  is  to\r\n\r\ncensure the Government. Information was leaked out from\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Department and the Minister in charge is\r\n\r\na  Government  Minister - the  Financial  Secretary.  The\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary should take the  necessary  action\r\n\r\nfor the leakage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when you bring in a motion, that automatically\r\n\r\nmeans  you  are  censuring the Financial Secretary  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will support this motion. It is not because of\r\n\r\nthe  calling for an inquiry. It is firstly, because  it\r\n\r\nis censuring the Financial Secretary and the Government\r\n\r\nfor  their incompetence and bungling. Secondly, for the\r\n\r\nleakage  of  information. It is admitted that  a  civil\r\n\r\nservant  has  leaked  out certain  information  and  he\r\n\r\nshould  be  punished. I agree, but let us evaluate  the\r\n\r\ninformation  against the crime he  has  committed.  The\r\n\r\ninformation  released was that our former Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation had received $500,000 from some source. Well,\r\n\r\nto receive $500,000, he must have sold some information\r\n\r\nor  render some service to foreign people, otherwise no\r\n\r\nfool is going to give him $500,000 for nothing. He must\r\n\r\nhave  made  a promise to give certain service  to  that\r\n\r\nforeign force. But what is the service? Service against\r\n\r\nthe interests of the population of Singapore. So it  is\r\n\r\na  question of selling the service of 1,500,000  people\r\n\r\nand  receiving $500,000 by an individual - one  Minister.\r\n\r\nSo when you count the Civil -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just wondering whether the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  is  anticipating the findings of the Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry  that is to be set up.

I hope the House, in the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the integrity of the civil service,  will\r\n\r\njoin  me  in  repudiating in no  mean  terms  any  such\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Mr Francis Thomas has suggested that\r\n\r\nthere is a lot of ado about nothing in this matter  and\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  really  no  distinction  between   the\r\n\r\nleakage, which is the subject of this motion,  and  the\r\n\r\ntype  of Press leakage, which I must agree with him  is\r\n\r\nall  too  common.  But I think there is  a  fundamental\r\n\r\ndifference between these two. It often happens that the\r\n\r\nPress  by  their own means are apt to obtain access  to\r\n\r\ninformation  or a Government intention or  proposal  in\r\n\r\nadvance  of  the  time when the Government  intends  to\r\n\r\nrelease it. That may be at times embarrassing.  But  it\r\n\r\ndoes not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  further  than that. But I do suggest  to  him  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a very great difference between that type  of\r\n\r\nleakage and a leakage where there may or there may  not\r\n\r\nhave  been a deliberate breach of his oath by  a  civil\r\n\r\nservant,  and  where  the public  are  entitled  to  be\r\n\r\nassured   that   any  information  made  available   in\r\n\r\nconnection  with their income tax assessments  is  kept\r\n\r\nsecret, not just for a few days, but for all time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. friend the Financial Secretary will, I have\r\n\r\nno  doubt,  be informing the House that as soon  as  it\r\n\r\nbecame  clear that there had been a leakage he at  once\r\n\r\nput  in  hand a departmental investigation. But I  must\r\n\r\npoint   out   to   the   House  that   a   departmental\r\n\r\ninvestigation,  and it is not yet complete,  does  have\r\n\r\nits  limitation. Where the parties concerned are solely\r\n\r\nmembers of the department or Government servants,  then\r\n\r\nit may be possible to clear the matter up and arrive at\r\n\r\nthe  truth.  But where there are members of the  public\r\n\r\nconcerned, they are not of course compellable witnesses\r\n\r\nfor the purpose of a departmental investigation, and if\r\n\r\nthe  information  is particularly in  their  possession\r\n\r\nwhich  would  enable  an inquiry of  this  kind  to  be\r\n\r\nbrought   to   a   successful  conclusion,   then   the\r\n\r\ndepartmental investigation can be completely frustrated\r\n\r\nif  they  are not willing to come forward. Hon. Members\r\n\r\nwill  remember that that was the situation in  relation\r\n\r\nto  the  investigation  of the leakage  of  examination\r\n\r\npapers in the Chinese Middle School examinations. As  I\r\n\r\nsee it at present, it is still a matter for speculation\r\n\r\nas  to  how this leakage occurred. It may have  been  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  carelessness; it may have been a matter  of\r\n\r\nnegligence,  or it may have been that a  civil  servant\r\n\r\nwas  deliberately responsible. The matter clearly needs\r\n\r\nto be explained and the public anxiety to be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIf  the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar is taking part in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  debate  later,  I hope he  will  deal  with  that\r\n\r\nparticular point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.29 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, there are two points that  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to speak on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First with regard to the Department. There is need\r\n\r\nfor  confidentiality of information in the  Department.\r\n\r\nThere has been public concern over the disclosures that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  made at the last sitting on 4th March and  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the name of the Department  should  be\r\n\r\ncleared.

The looting\r\n\r\nwas  known  by someone outside the protected  area  and\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  Assembly, who  are  supposed  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people, held up their  hands  in\r\n\r\nhorror and in mock indignation, not at the fact of  the\r\n\r\nlooting  but at the fact that it was known outside  the\r\n\r\nprotected area, We did not hear the Member for  Queenstown  or  the Member for Paya Lebar or the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon, when the issue of the $500,000 was  debated,\r\n\r\nbut now the cry is for shame that that should ever have\r\n\r\nbeen   made  known.  Sir,  it  was  a  calculated   and\r\n\r\ndeliberate act when I read out the file number to prove\r\n\r\ntwo  things - that it is one thing for the Government  to\r\n\r\nexpect  loyalty  from civil servants, but  that  it  is\r\n\r\nanother   thing   when  the  Financial  Secretary,   in\r\n\r\npursuance  of  the  orders from his elected  Ministers,\r\n\r\nmakes  a  statement  which he  knows  to  be  partially\r\n\r\nincorrect. We did not expect that kind of conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is almost an air of comedy about this\r\n\r\nmotion.  This is a Government matter. If the Government\r\n\r\nwants  to  have a Commission of Inquiry,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity to move a motion in this Assembly.  Press  on\r\n\r\nwith it, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis of course is a diversion. Everybody was aghast and\r\n\r\nflabbergasted  that this thing should have  been  known\r\n\r\nand  the  best way of distracting attention is to  talk\r\n\r\nabout how it came to be known. Sir, at the proper  time\r\n\r\nand  in the proper place, we shall let it be known  how\r\n\r\nit  came  to  be  known. But I will say  this:  if  you\r\n\r\nexpect,  as  we expect, integrity in the  service,  you\r\n\r\nmust  have Ministers to set the pace. Anyone  who  goes\r\n\r\ninto  any  of the Government Ministries can  smell  the\r\n\r\ndecay and feel the sense of collapse of morale. That is\r\n\r\nbad, because we have to run the same machine and it  is\r\n\r\nour  duty to stiffen up the morale. That was the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  we  gave  the  file  number.  Does  the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  realise  that  anybody  can  pick   up   the\r\n\r\ntelephone - but: not now, because there is such a jolt in\r\n\r\nthe   Income  Tax  Department  that  nobody  will   say\r\n\r\nanything - and say, \"I am Mr So and So. Will you  please\r\n\r\ngive  me  my file number?\" And they do. The Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment  literally speaks to  the  public  over  the\r\n\r\nphone and gives a man's file number. I have tried  it,\r\n\r\nbefore  they made this an issue. How do I come to  know\r\n\r\nthis?  I can tell the Financial Secretary and the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  a  few  other  things.  I  know  that   this\r\n\r\ndepartmental inquiry has been going on, as it ought  to\r\n\r\nbe without waiting for a resolution of this Assembly. I\r\n\r\nknow  that  Mr  Teo  Kah Leong  and  Mr  Pepper  (the\r\n\r\nComptroller-General of Income Tax) have  been  doing  a\r\n\r\ndepartmental  inquiry,  and  I  know  that  they   have\r\n\r\nshortlisted it to three or four gentlemen. I would like\r\n\r\nto  inform  them that they have got the  wrong  people.\r\n\r\nThey  are  not  involved. How do I know it?  It  is  my\r\n\r\nbusiness  to  know what is going on in this Government,\r\n\r\notherwise  we would not have survived. I say  this:  we\r\n\r\nwill keep on knowing what is going on right to the end,\r\n\r\nand  it is because we know what is going on that  I  am\r\n\r\ngoing  to move the next motion which is down for debate\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no objections to a Commission of\r\n\r\nInquiry. I think the Chief Secretary knows exactly what\r\n\r\nthe results will be.

In the course of this Inquiry \r\n\r\n- be  it  one or two - let it never be forgotten that  our\r\n\r\nsense  of  morality should not get perverted. What  was\r\n\r\nreally  disgraceful was the deliberate lie  and  denial\r\n\r\nbefore  we produced the evidence. I spent a great  deal\r\n\r\nof  the  time of this Assembly at its last  sitting  in\r\n\r\ngiving  details just to make sure that this  House  and\r\n\r\nthe  public  understand, Sir, that before  we  make  an\r\n\r\nassertion of fact, we have ascertained its accuracy. In\r\n\r\nmy position as leader of an Opposition political Party,\r\n\r\nI get a lot of information - some confidential, some very\r\n\r\nconfidential, and most highly explosive. I do  not  use\r\n\r\nit  unless  I  am sure of it. I will just give  you  an\r\n\r\nexample, Mr Speaker, Sir. The moment the motion on Mr\r\n\r\nChew Swee Kee was on, I received many letters giving me\r\n\r\nmore  details of that transaction, it was  a  political\r\n\r\ngift.  We  thought  well  of  the  civil  service,  and\r\n\r\nbelieved they acted properly. Therefore, they must have\r\n\r\nsatisfied themselves that it was a political  gift  not\r\n\r\nliable  to  income  tax. But according  to  information\r\n\r\nwhich I have now received from the post, it says,  \"You\r\n\r\ncan  check  it up by advertising so and so and  then  I\r\n\r\nshall  cross-check  and  prove further  by  giving  you\r\n\r\nfurther information.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> On a point of order.\r\n\r\nSir.

I believe they have blundered\r\n\r\ninto  something which is completely unnecessary. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  our  business in this Assembly to bring  down  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system. We have had four years of  a  half-trial in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na baby Austin with dual-control, and we are about to\r\n\r\nshed the driving instructor and take over. I was\r\n\r\nprepared not to press for a Commission. My Party took a\r\n\r\ndecision at a Central Executive Committee meeting after\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister's offer to allow Mr Chew to resign.\r\n\r\nWe were prepared to forego the trials and tribulations\r\n\r\nand the ordeals of the disclosures that are bound to\r\n\r\ntake place. That will not only disgrace Mr Chew, but\r\n\r\nwill disgrace the whole of the democratic process. Due\r\n\r\nto some uncontrollable impulse, the Chief Minister in a\r\n\r\nfit of anger said, \"Let us go on with it.\" Now he\r\n\r\nthinks that since everybody on his side is getting into\r\n\r\ndirt, why not try and get the Opposition and the civil\r\n\r\nservice into it also? I ask him to remember this.\r\n\r\nMinisters may come and Ministers may go, but it is our\r\n\r\nbusiness to see that the institutions which we are\r\n\r\nestablishing survive, and it is not our business to try\r\n\r\nto bring these institutions into disrepute. I welcome\r\n\r\nthe remarks about people of integrity leading the\r\n\r\ncountry. I often feel that the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon - whatever his other failings - is not a\r\n\r\ndishonest man, and I think he should be the first to be\r\n\r\ndistressed to discover that the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nwas not the man of integrity that he would have liked,\r\n\r\nin order to give morale and tone to the service which\r\n\r\nhe led. As a result not only of this disclosure but\r\n\r\nalso of a series of misdemeanours which took place in\r\n\r\nhis Ministry - perhaps through no fault of his - the whole\r\n\r\nof the education service and all parents whose children\r\n\r\nare in school have lost faith in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation. One and a half million cannot be accounted\r\n\r\nfor. Defalcations-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

If you\r\n\r\nengage in mercenary activities and leave your political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduties and responsibilities by the side, then you, as\r\n\r\nthe political head, must be responsible for the\r\n\r\nconsequences that are bound to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry if this disclosure has\r\n\r\nfrightened - according to the Member for Changi - corrupt\r\n\r\ndiplomats from foreign countries. I hate to believe\r\n\r\nthat there are corrupt diplomats from neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries. Unless it is proved to the contrary, I\r\n\r\nbelieve them to be honest men of integrity. But let no\r\n\r\none be under the same misapprehension as the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar is that a P.A.P. Government will not know\r\n\r\nwhat is happening. The Chief Minister told us in this\r\n\r\nHouse that he did not know Mr Khaw Kai-Boh had already\r\n\r\nbecome an entitled officer and was going to quit. I did\r\n\r\nnot believe him. I did not believe him because I could\r\n\r\nnot believe that the Government can go on without\r\n\r\nknowing what is happening. I did not want to embarrass\r\n\r\nthe Chief Secretary yesterday by asking whether he knew\r\n\r\nabout the five others who applied and one who had\r\n\r\nbecome entitled. I did not want to press for their\r\n\r\nnames. If and when it is necessary after the elections,\r\n\r\nwe shall know what we want to know. But if you want the\r\n\r\nsystem to succeed and if you want men to assume\r\n\r\nresponsibility, then you must give them full control.\r\n\r\nIf you run a baby Austin with the driving instructor\r\n\r\nalways changing into reverse gear when you want to move\r\n\r\nforward, then verily you must crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry for the Government. They never had a\r\n\r\nchance and the Chief Minister ought to know why. But I\r\n\r\nwill say this for him and his Ministers. We are\r\n\r\ngrateful to them for one thing. They opened Pandora's\r\n\r\nbox. We know what is inside. We know every turn in this\r\n\r\nmaze and we hope that when it is our turn to lead, we\r\n\r\nshall lead with firmness, resolution and purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.51 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when a piece of\r\n\r\ncake is thrown at a group of persons, the ensuing\r\n\r\nbehaviour of that group shows their maturity. If they\r\n\r\nscramble for the cake and during the scramble they\r\n\r\nknock things over, the world sees that they are but\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  they are adults, they will realise the consequences\r\n\r\nof  their  actions. They will realise that the knocked-over  things are more important than the piece of  cake\r\n\r\nfor  which  they  scramble; and today we  are  in  that\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take stock of Singapore today, Sir. We have had\r\n\r\nover  100 years of colonialism. After the war, we  have\r\n\r\nhad  a  few years of colonial stooges nominated to  the\r\n\r\nLegislative    Council    but    not     having     any\r\n\r\nresponsibilities. Now, the elected Ministers have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  a  difficult  period during  these  last  four\r\n\r\nyears,  Sir, not only because the baby Austin is  dual-controlled - as the Member for Tanjong Pagar said - whereby\r\n\r\ncertain  powers  are  with the  elected  Ministers  and\r\n\r\ncertain  powers  are  not, but also  because  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember and his Party have not made things easy for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore and for the Government.  Memories\r\n\r\nare not short, Sir. We have gone through riots. We have\r\n\r\ngone  through all sorts of difficult periods.  We  have\r\n\r\ngone  through a period of tension with our neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries - with the Federation of Malaya - all because  of\r\n\r\ncertain members of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this scramble for power, the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nwilling to sacrifice what is most important of all, and\r\n\r\nthat  is the democratic system. We have lost all  sense\r\n\r\nof   values.  Today,  we  are  being  judged  by  other\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the world according to our actions,  and\r\n\r\nour  actions  in  the past do not  show  that  we  have\r\n\r\nreached  maturity.  Sir,  a  sense  of  proportion   is\r\n\r\nimportant  in  political behaviour. Unfortunately,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. do  not seem to realise that. The  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nmade  a  call  for sanity, Sir. That call appropriately\r\n\r\nfits his own Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually boasted that it was his business to know\r\n\r\nwhat  was going on in the Government and thereby showed\r\n\r\nthat he condones this method of spying. It is certainly\r\n\r\nhis business, as an Opposition Party Member, to know of\r\n\r\nGovernment policies and to oppose or support them as he\r\n\r\npleases;  but it is certainly not his business  to  get\r\n\r\npeople to spy into confidential files of the public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  are entrusted to Government departments, because\r\n\r\nthat is the root of good government. If the rot sets in\r\n\r\nand  if  every  bit of information that any  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment holds is available for use by politicians or\r\n\r\nby  unscrupulous persons, then where do members of  the\r\n\r\npublic  stand, Sir? How can we then have any confidence\r\n\r\nleft  in  the  Government of the  country  and  in  the\r\n\r\npoliticians  who  may form the next Government  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member posed the question: \"Why have a\r\n\r\nmotion in the Assembly? The Government themselves could\r\n\r\nhave appointed a Court of Inquiry.\" The purpose of  the\r\n\r\nmotion  in  this  Assembly  is  to  see  how  perverted\r\n\r\nthinking  could  be, how the Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nwould individually react to this despicable conduct  of\r\n\r\nhuman beings in spying and passing on secrets entrusted\r\n\r\nto  them.  We have seen today - I am sorry,  Sir,  and  I\r\n\r\nspeak  more in sorrow than in anger - the reaction of  my\r\n\r\nformer  colleague, Mr Francis Thomas. It  is  strange,\r\n\r\nSir,  how  people change overnight. I do not  know  the\r\n\r\nreason  for this sudden change overnight of a  man  who\r\n\r\nwas  violently  opposed to the P.A.P. But  besides  his\r\n\r\npolitical way of thinking - he may have fallen  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. way of thinking-he opposes something that nobody\r\n\r\nin  his right senses would oppose and he condones  what\r\n\r\nseems to be despicable conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chew Swee Kee never thought fit to confide in\r\n\r\nme about the money matters brought up in this House. He\r\n\r\nthought  fit to confide in Mr Francis Thomas  who  was\r\n\r\nthe  first Vice-President of the Labour Front  at  that\r\n\r\ntime.  I was the second Vice-President then. But if  he\r\n\r\nhad confided in me, I would have thought twice before I\r\n\r\ngave   out  something  that  was  confided  to  me   in\r\n\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

At what price are\r\n\r\nwe  to  get this power? Are we going to get that power\r\n\r\nat  the  price  of sacrificing the livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\npeople? This has got to be thought of,\r\n\r\nand  a person who is a responsible person will  think\r\n\r\ndeeply before he takes action which will undermine the\r\n\r\nwhole life of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is an indication of the methods of the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party when they are in the Opposition,\r\n\r\nI  do  not know what will happen when they are in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. We already see the happenings in the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  They  have aroused a  lot  of  fear  and\r\n\r\nresentment  in  the hearts of the general  public  who\r\n\r\nunderstand the deep significance of their actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the democratic system can only work if both\r\n\r\nsides  play the game. So far we find in England  that,\r\n\r\nhowever  bitterly the Parties oppose each other,  they\r\n\r\nstick  to  the  rules and they play the game.  If  one\r\n\r\nParty  does  not  play the game, then  the  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  will collapse and the hon. Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  knows it full well; he is out not to  see  that\r\n\r\nthe  democratic system works, but he is out to  get  a\r\n\r\none-Party  rule,  That  is not  a  statement  made  at\r\n\r\nrandom.  I  base that statement, Sir, on three  facts.\r\n\r\nOne  is  the goings-on in the City Council when  peons\r\n\r\ncan  be  asked to come in as an inquisition  team  and\r\n\r\ngive  evidence against a Councillor on a motion  which\r\n\r\nhas  no  relevance  to the personal  conduct  of  that\r\n\r\nCouncillor. I dread to think what would happen  if  we\r\n\r\nhad  a  Speaker  here in the next Assembly  Session - a\r\n\r\nParty  man - who allows peons to come into  this  House\r\n\r\nand  give  evidence against Assemblymen. Is  that  the\r\n\r\nessence  of  democracy?  The  second  basis   for   my\r\n\r\nstatement  that the P.A.P. are out to have a one-Party\r\n\r\nrule  is  the  fact that the Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\njibed at me two months back in this House when I moved\r\n\r\namendments to certain Bills connected with industries.\r\n\r\nHe  jibed  at me, Sir, saying that it was a  come-down\r\n\r\nfor  me  to have moved those amendments and I  replied\r\n\r\nthat I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  no  dictator. Now that again is  the  essence  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  If a Minister or a person responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe  conduct of the affairs of a country is  satisfied\r\n\r\nfrom representations made, from whichever sources they\r\n\r\nmay   be - whether   from  the   Opposition   or   from\r\n\r\noutside - that  what he intends to do is not  ultimately\r\n\r\ngoing   to  benefit  the  country,  and  that  certain\r\n\r\namendments are necessary, it is his duty to make those\r\n\r\namendments  irrespective of whether he loses  face  or\r\n\r\nnot.  That is the essence of democracy, but the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar does not understand that. He  jibed\r\n\r\nat   me  for  making  those  amendments  when  I  felt\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the amendments were necessary. It is no\r\n\r\nshame,  Sir, to own up that one can be wrong at times.\r\n\r\nA human being has his weaknesses and the human element\r\n\r\nis present in every form of action of a human being. A\r\n\r\nMinister can be wrong, a Government can be wrong,  and\r\n\r\nindividuals can be wrong too. But it is the essence of\r\n\r\ndemocracy, that when your actions are going to have an\r\n\r\neffect  on  the  livelihood  of  the  people  and  you\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  you  are wrong,  you  must  make  the\r\n\r\nchanges  and the kudos should go to the man who  makes\r\n\r\nthe  changes  voluntarily by himself, rather  than  be\r\n\r\nforced to do so. And to be jibed for doing that, shows\r\n\r\nthe mentality of the person and of the Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third factor, Sir, is the oft-repeated boast of\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member  for Tanjong Pagar about  his  Party\r\n\r\norganization.  He has said very often,  \"We  have  the\r\n\r\norganization.\" The basis of his democracy  talk  rests\r\n\r\nsolely  on the fact of the Party organization, not  of\r\n\r\nwhat  the  people want, not of what the people  think,\r\n\r\nbut  rather  on  the Party organization  to  fool  the\r\n\r\npeople  into  voting for them. Sir, that is  something\r\n\r\nthat  can  be  developed into a thing  that  could  be\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the people. Not only Communism has that\r\n\r\nsystem,  Sir,  we had it in Nazi Germany,  in  Fascist\r\n\r\nItaly,  and  to a certain extent we have  it  even  in\r\n\r\nSpain  now under Franco. Once you get people with  the\r\n\r\nthought  that  \"It  is  the  Party  organization  that\r\n\r\nmatters,  and  nothing else\", you have a system  where\r\n\r\nyou  cannot even talk to your neighbour. You dare not,\r\n\r\nbecause you can never know what your neighbour might\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe - whether he might be spying on you and relaying  what\r\n\r\nyou  have  said to the Government agent. You  dare  not\r\n\r\neven speak to members of your own family! Your children\r\n\r\nmay  be  spying on you and telling their teachers,  who\r\n\r\nmay be Government agents, of what you have said. Again,\r\n\r\nSir,  according  to the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,  the\r\n\r\nessence of democracy is the Party organization,  but  I\r\n\r\nsay  it  is  not.  It is the people voluntarily  giving\r\n\r\ntheir   opinion  through  the  ballot.  Not   a   Party\r\n\r\norganization that works like a machine and  drives  the\r\n\r\npeople    to    give   votes   through    intimidation,\r\n\r\nthrough - maybe the word is \"hostage\", though there is  a\r\n\r\nmuch worse word, Sir, but I do not think you will allow\r\n\r\nme  to use it - or lure of gold or promise of power.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong  Pagar may say  that  he  is  non-Communist, and I believe that he is non-Communist.  But\r\n\r\nnon-Communism  is  not the end. A man  can  be  a  non-Communist and yet be a dictator. The Japanese  are  not\r\n\r\nCommunists,   and  yet  during  their   occupation   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  people  suffered  because   of   their\r\n\r\ndictatorial methods, like the Kempeitai's.  Hitler  was\r\n\r\nnot  a  Communist; in fact, he fought Communist Russia,\r\n\r\nand yet the people under Hitler were not happy. Sir, it\r\n\r\nis  not only a matter of whether you are a Communist or\r\n\r\nnot,  but a matter of whether you are really a democrat\r\n\r\nor  not.  You  can  be a non-Communist  and  yet  be  a\r\n\r\ndictator.  You can grind the people under the  heel  of\r\n\r\ndictatorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon.

In the\r\n\r\nelections!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to remember this. Keep your politics and your\r\n\r\npersonal views out of your service. If you take the\r\n\r\nChief Minister's advice\"-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>The advice was to vote for whom they like-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"and try to down the Government because you do not\r\n\r\nagree  with it, then that Government will not  tolerate\r\n\r\nit.  Take  the advice of the Opposition: Do  your  duty\r\n\r\nbecause  that  is  right;  do  not  try  to  'fix'  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, that, read by anybody, seems to be a threat - a\r\n\r\nthreat  to the civil servants - \"If you do not  vote  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. and try to fix the S.P.A. Government, then\r\n\r\nyou beware!\" If that is not the interpretation, and the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  is  that  you  must   be   honest   and\r\n\r\nstraightforward to the Government of the time, and  not\r\n\r\nto  try  and  'fix' it, or try to embarrass  it  or  do\r\n\r\nanything against the\r\n\r\nGovernment, then the action of the person who gave all\r\n\r\nthese  leakages about the Minister was an  action  that\r\n\r\ncould be interpreted as 'fixing' the Government in that\r\n\r\nsense of the word. As such, that action cannot then  be\r\n\r\ncondoned by any Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some mention was made by, I believe, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar,  of \"looting wildly  in  protected\r\n\r\nplaces\",  or  words  to  that  effect.  \"There  was  no\r\n\r\nshouting from the Government Backbenchers. Now they are\r\n\r\nout  to  find out how it was looted\" - or words  to  that\r\n\r\neffect,  Sir  I have not got the exact quotation.  Sir,\r\n\r\nonce  looting takes place, it is just as important also\r\n\r\nto  find  the  causes of the looting and to  catch  the\r\n\r\nlooters, so that there will be no more looting  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Therefore, it is as important to find out  not\r\n\r\nonly what has been looted, but also to find out who has\r\n\r\nbeen  the looter. And if the P.A.P. do not follow these\r\n\r\nprinciples, then  a different government  will  be  in\r\n\r\npower.  The  hon. Member's own words in the  past  have\r\n\r\nclearly  indicated that they intend  to  be  much  more\r\n\r\nharsh on persons who try to 'fix' their government. Let\r\n\r\nus  have  a  sense  of sanity, as the hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar wants us to believe that he would like to\r\n\r\nhave. Let us try and work this democratic system  in  a\r\n\r\nfair  manner.  Today, we find many  countries  in  Asia\r\n\r\nstarted  the democratic system that was handed down  to\r\n\r\nthem  on a platter - a written constitution - England never\r\n\r\nhad  a  written  constitution, a  written  constitution\r\n\r\nembodying  all  sorts of safety for its  citizens.  And\r\n\r\nwhat is in the hands of these countries today? They are\r\n\r\nin  the hands of military governments although we might\r\n\r\ncall  it  \"a  benevolent dictatorship\".  We,  Sir,  are\r\n\r\ntrying the same experiment here. If we want to succeed,\r\n\r\nwe have got to play fair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  both sides. If we do not want to succeed, then  the\r\n\r\nworld  is  going to laugh at us, and we  will  probably\r\n\r\nfind  that our constitution may be suspended, or  riots\r\n\r\nmight start all over again, or the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nmight  have  to  step in in some place,  because  their\r\n\r\nsecurity  may  he prejudiced due to our  actions  here.\r\n\r\nThings  which certainly will not be beneficial  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  and to  their  livelihood  might\r\n\r\nhappen.  Then  let  us  at all  times  in  our  actions\r\n\r\nremember that the purpose of politics is to enhance the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of the people, and therefore  the  economic\r\n\r\nconditions  of the country should be the first  thought\r\n\r\nto be given to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.12 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I consider that a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry as suggested by my hon, friend, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown, is very reasonable in connection with\r\n\r\nthe  disclosures  made by the hon. Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar in his speech on the 4th March. Sir, to quote his\r\n\r\nfamous words (Hansard col. 2155), he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Sir, the facts are there. First, for the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe Financial Secretary, we will just tell him that  we\r\n\r\nhave got all the cards on the table. Mr Chew's file is\r\n\r\nG.S. 47909.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  it is not reasonable to have information of  this\r\n\r\nkind  coming from a person who is not entitled to  that\r\n\r\ninformation.  I feel that a Commission  of  Inquiry  is\r\n\r\nfully   justified,  in  view  of  the  fact  that   any\r\n\r\ndepartmental  inquiry  would  be  inadequate  for  that\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think, Sir, that this is of national\r\n\r\nimportance  and cannot be just left with a departmental\r\n\r\ninquiry. I was amazed when the hon. Member talked about\r\n\r\nthe  civil service. At one stage, he praised the  civil\r\n\r\nservice and at another he condoned the offences of  the\r\n\r\ncivil service. I regard the attempt made at the sitting\r\n\r\non the 4th March, as an attempt to demoralise the civil\r\n\r\nservice at the present time. This time is the time when\r\n\r\nthe  civil servants must be given encouragement to keep\r\n\r\nup  their  morale and to enable them to continue  their\r\n\r\nservice  impartially with the incoming  government.  No\r\n\r\ngovernment of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  type repeated that, if they came into power,  they\r\n\r\nwould  keep the civil service neutral, but on the other\r\n\r\nhand,  attempts  will be made to demoralise  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants.  It  was  an  indiscretionary  act  which,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  is regrettable indeed. At the same  time,  we\r\n\r\nmust   get  down  to  the  bottom  of  the  truth   and\r\n\r\ninvestigate  into  all the matters connected  with  the\r\n\r\nleakage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I consider that the previous motion calling for\r\n\r\na  Commission of inquiry and this one are related,  but\r\n\r\nsurely  the  objects of the two are different.  I  felt\r\n\r\nthat a Commission of Inquiry called for by the previous\r\n\r\nmotion  was  justified, and similarly  I  feel  that  a\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry is also justified in this  case,\r\n\r\nbecause  this is of national importance and any  effort\r\n\r\nby  the  civil service to do such an act, as  had  been\r\n\r\ndone,  should  be  nipped in the bud  as  the  incoming\r\n\r\ngovernment expects the civil service to be  of  a  very\r\n\r\nhigh  calibre and it cannot have any black sheep in  it\r\n\r\nto  spoil its fair name. Sir, I sincerely support  this\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.16 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar said that it was\r\n\r\nnot necessary for this motion to be moved, and that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could appoint a Commission of Inquiry.  The\r\n\r\nfact that this motion is brought before this House is - I\r\n\r\nforgot  his  very  words - that it  is  nothing  but  an\r\n\r\nelection  stunt. Sir, the hon. Member who  tabled  this\r\n\r\nmotion felt very strongly about this disclosure, but he\r\n\r\ndid not take part in the debate on the motion which was\r\n\r\nbrought  up at the last sitting by the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar calling for a Commission of Inquiry.  The\r\n\r\nBack-benchers did not take part in that debate  because\r\n\r\nthey  did not know the facts of the case and they could\r\n\r\nnot contribute to the debate at all; it was left to  me\r\n\r\nto reply on behalf of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, as usual, was\r\n\r\ncarried  away  by  his eloquence. He said  these  words\r\n\r\nwhich are very significant: \"If and when we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  in the Government, the civil service will have  no\r\n\r\nsecrets   from  the  Ministers.\"  And  he   said   this\r\n\r\nparticularly in the context of a debate on  an  alleged\r\n\r\ndisclosure in the Income Tax Department. The Income Tax\r\n\r\nlaw is very, very clear - there shall be no disclosure to\r\n\r\nanyone, not even to the Government of the day. And  how\r\n\r\nfirm  that Department has been can be gauged  from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  when one Ministry instituted investigations\r\n\r\ninto allegations of corruption, it came up against  the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Department which refused to disclose even to\r\n\r\nthe  Government the facts, or whatever facts there are,\r\n\r\nthat  are made available by the person concerned  under\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax law. And yet the hon. Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  would have it that \"Law or no law,  we  are  the\r\n\r\nsupreme  power, and we do what we like.\" That, Sir,  is\r\n\r\nrather disturbing to the public of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has since said something more about\r\n\r\nMr  Khaw Kai-Boh. I told him I was not aware that this\r\n\r\nofficer became an entitled officer until November, when\r\n\r\nhe  sent  in  his notice of resignation.  He  found  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to believe me. I am not worried  whether  he\r\n\r\nbelieves me or not, but that is the truth. He  did  say\r\n\r\none  thing,  Sir,  \"Let our sense of morality  not  get\r\n\r\nperverted.\"  And  yet he disclosed in the  same  speech\r\n\r\nthat  he has a lot of information at his disposal, that\r\n\r\nhe could use it if he felt inclined, but he did not use\r\n\r\nit  because  he felt that it was not necessary  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the civil service or of his  Party.  But\r\n\r\nsurely,  Sir,  if  he had such disclosures  and  if  he\r\n\r\nwished  to  maintain an independent civil service  with\r\n\r\nintegrity, he could have reported such misdemeanours to\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  and  the Government  would  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to look into the allegations  of  wrongful\r\n\r\nacts  and  thereby  help to protect the  civil  service\r\n\r\nwhich  he  himself hopes to take over  at  the  general\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed lamentable that as we - get nearer to\r\n\r\nthe  general  elections,  it  is  inevitable  that  our\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents want to indulge  in  mud-slinging,\r\n\r\nand  it  does happen that in this clamour for power,  a\r\n\r\nlot  of casualties take place along the line. The  hon.\r\n\r\nMr  Francis  Thomas  yesterday, in  his  speech,  made\r\n\r\ncertain disparaging remarks regarding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  manner  in  which  my office  treats  confidential\r\n\r\ndocuments. For the record, I would like to state that I\r\n\r\nam  not  aware that there has been any leakage from  my\r\n\r\noffice since its setting-up. I am satisfied, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthe Confidential Registry in my office is out of bounds\r\n\r\nto  unauthorised persons and Government personnel.  If.\r\n\r\nas  the  hon. Mr Francis Thomas has alleged, this  has\r\n\r\nnot  been so, I am indeed very surprised that he should\r\n\r\nonly  now  choose to divulge this after he has resigned\r\n\r\nhis  Ministerial  office and after he has  crossed  the\r\n\r\nFloor. He had every opportunity of bringing this matter\r\n\r\nto  my  notice, or, if not, at least to my  Secretary's\r\n\r\nattention.  But he did not choose to do so. Of  course,\r\n\r\nnow  that he is on the Opposite Bench, he has not  lost\r\n\r\nmuch  time  in  regaling us with some  of  his  dubious\r\n\r\nreminiscences   regarding  our  alleged   actions   and\r\n\r\nomissions. But then we are well aware that Mr  Francis\r\n\r\nThomas  himself has his own ideas of how  to  safeguard\r\n\r\nconfidential information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another motion coming up immediately\r\n\r\nafter  this  and, as the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nhas  said, he has a lot of disclosures which  he  would\r\n\r\nlike  to make when he moves that motion. I would rather\r\n\r\nwait  until  those disclosures are made  before  I  say\r\n\r\nanything further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.25 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think\r\n\r\nthere is much for me to reply, as my Chief Minister and\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues  have covered most of  the  points.  But\r\n\r\nthere  is  one  thing: from this debate I have  learned\r\n\r\nsomething more than what I actually knew. We  all  know\r\n\r\nthat  politics  is  dirty. Everyone of  us  knows  that\r\n\r\npolitics  is  dirty. But the surprising thing  is  that\r\n\r\nafter  this  debate I learn that politics is  so  dirty\r\n\r\nthat it can put a country at stake. It has come to this\r\n\r\nstage - our country now is at stake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here politicians who are honourable Members,\r\n\r\nlike  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar and the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park,  coming to this House to connive  at  and\r\n\r\nabet an offence which both of them were fully aware and\r\n\r\nfully\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow is against the law. They have come here to express\r\n\r\nthat  they are prepared to encourage civil servants  to\r\n\r\ndisclose secret and confidential information. Such  are\r\n\r\nthe honourable Members that we have in this House!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, our country now is at stake. We have\r\n\r\nnow  come  to the conclusion that there is a  political\r\n\r\nParty  prepared to plant stooges in the civil  service.\r\n\r\nWe  now  come  to know that there is a political  Party\r\n\r\nthat   is  politically  corrupt  and  prepared  to   do\r\n\r\nanything.  For this, Sir, I now come to the  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  I  must  warn  the people of  Singapore,  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  our country, that they must  realise  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of having such politicians if  they  vote\r\n\r\nthe  wrong Party into power. They must now vote  wisely\r\n\r\nand  properly. It is only a matter of two months before\r\n\r\nwe go to the polls, and if they vote wrongly, they will\r\n\r\nfind that they have voted traitors into the Government,\r\n\r\ntraitors  who  are prepared to betray  our  confidence,\r\n\r\ntraitors  who  are prepared to betray our country, and\r\n\r\ntraitors who are prepared to betray our people and sell\r\n\r\nour  country.  Are we going to have such a  government?\r\n\r\nSir,  I warn the people of Singapore, all citizens  who\r\n\r\nhave a right to vote to vote wisely, whoever he may be-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not to vote for Lee Choon Eng!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - at least, whichever Party that\r\n\r\ncomes into power, we do not want traitors, traitors who\r\n\r\nare   prepared  to  disclose  secret  and  confidential\r\n\r\ninformation which they have come, to know through their\r\n\r\nofficial  capacity. The Member for Serangoon  correctly\r\n\r\nstated  that it is only people with influence and  with\r\n\r\npositions   who  are  able  to  get  such  secret   and\r\n\r\nconfidential information. As a man-in-the-street,  can\r\n\r\nhe get such confidential information? Certainly not! It\r\n\r\nis  only  those who are in high positions that can  get\r\n\r\nsuch  information.  Then,  if  only  people  with  high\r\n\r\npositions  can  get  such  information,  how  did   the\r\n\r\nleakages come about? I am quite sure if such people can\r\n\r\nleak out information, they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalways  in the habit of leaking secret and confidential\r\n\r\ninformation either from the Government to the  enemies - as  I  have  stated, it is a betrayal of trust - or  from\r\n\r\nParty  to  Party.  I  was very  horrified  to  hear  in\r\n\r\nyesterday's  sitting that Mr Francis Thomas  disclosed\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  leakage  even  from  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters. It is really surprising and horrifying.  Was\r\n\r\nhe  not  a Member of that Council of Ministers? If  so,\r\n\r\nthen  was it not his duty to report such a leakage,  if\r\n\r\nthere had been any? I really cannot understand. In  all\r\n\r\nmy four years in this Assembly. I have not heard of any\r\n\r\nleakage from the Council of Ministers. But today an ex-Member of the Council of Ministers comes here and tells\r\n\r\nus  that  there  was even leakage from the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters. It was his bounden duty to report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am allowed, Sir, I would like to amend my\r\n\r\nmotion,  but  since I am not allowed, I would  ask  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  to  extend the terms  of  reference  of  my\r\n\r\nmotion,  so that the disclosures by Mr Francis  Thomas\r\n\r\nof the secret information from the Council of Ministers\r\n\r\nshould  also be investigated into.

He  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nencourage his own officers to go against the  law,  and\r\n\r\nif  he calls himself a legislator, then let us see  how\r\n\r\nhe enforces his law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point he mentioned was that it is very simple\r\n\r\nto   pick  up  a  telephone  and  ask  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment, \"What is my file number?\" I may agree  with\r\n\r\nhim  on this point. It is quite simple. \"Hello, is that\r\n\r\nthe Income Tax Department? I am so and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso.  May  I have my file number?\" But that file  number\r\n\r\nmay mean nothing. It is the seriousness of the contents\r\n\r\nof  that  file that is involved. It is not G.S.  47909.\r\n\r\nWhat  is that G.S. 47909? But what is recorded in  that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfile  No.  G.S. 47909 is involved, not that figure.  He\r\n\r\nmay  even  have a four-letter digit lottery or whatever\r\n\r\nit is with that number. It refers to nothing at all. If\r\n\r\nhe  thinks that he can depend on that lucky number, let\r\n\r\nhim  depend on it. But we are involved in the  contents\r\n\r\nthat are recorded in that file.

Those who have\r\n\r\ncome here hoping that we are going to pull the House\r\n\r\ndown will be disappointed, because it is not our\r\n\r\nintention to pull the House down. But we are gravely\r\n\r\nalarmed that in their Gotterdammerung our Ministers\r\n\r\nhave no quite the stability and judgment which we\r\n\r\nexpect of them when the lights go out on this\r\n\r\nGovernment. It requires a great man to go down coolly,\r\n\r\nquietly and sanely. When one goes down, there is an\r\n\r\nalmost irresistible impulse to pull everything down.\r\n\r\nWe saw it in 1956. I did not much admire the tactics\r\n\r\nand techniques of the Chief Minister, but I have\r\n\r\nalways thought him to be a tough little man who could\r\n\r\ntake it. But I discovered that, when the time came and\r\n\r\neverybody rushed for the lifeboats, he, the Captain,\r\n\r\nalso showed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  inclination to get on the life-boat. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nthought it was imperative after the last sitting, that\r\n\r\nwe  should  put  the issue back on a sane  and  proper\r\n\r\nbasis.  He  said  in the course of that  sitting  many\r\n\r\nthings.  But  none of them was more  damaging  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and to the confidence which we have in fair\r\n\r\nand  free elections than his one interjection - that  he\r\n\r\nintends to play dirty politics. It is one thing for an\r\n\r\nordinary Member of this House to say that he is  going\r\n\r\nto  resort to dirty methods and dirty politics. It  is\r\n\r\nanother  thing when it comes from the Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\neven  though it was in a fit of anger, in a moment  of\r\n\r\nmadness.  For  that reason, we assessed the  situation\r\n\r\nand  we  decided to table this motion. Two things  can\r\n\r\nhappen after this motion. We can go back to a sane and\r\n\r\nstable  basis  on  which political issues  are  to  be\r\n\r\nfought out; or we go off at a tangent, round the bend,\r\n\r\nand  have a real, all-in wrestling bout with no  holds\r\n\r\nbarred for the next two months. The outcome of such  a\r\n\r\ncontest must mean a lot of unhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up till now we are in control. The Chief Minister is\r\n\r\nin  control  of the apparatus of State  to  a  certain\r\n\r\nextent,  and  we  are in control of the  direction  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the contest shall be pursued. But once  certain\r\n\r\nthings happen and all the brakes are released, then we\r\n\r\ngo  tearing round the bend. I do not want to see  that\r\n\r\nhappen.   For  that  reason,  I  hope   that,   as   a\r\n\r\ndemonstration  that  he  intends  to, play  the  game\r\n\r\naccording  to  the rules, and not go  in  for  Siamese\r\n\r\nboxing,  first, that he will retract his statement  on\r\n\r\ndirty  politics; secondly, that he will also  withdraw\r\n\r\nwhat he said about a secret meeting which he said took\r\n\r\nplace  between him, me and the Secretary of State.  As\r\n\r\nfor  dirty  politics, he has indicated that  that  was\r\n\r\nsaid in a fit of anger. As for the other, he knows  it\r\n\r\nis  a  falsehood. However, I want to  put  this  issue\r\n\r\nplainly to him: that if it has to be all-in wrestling.\r\n\r\nthen we will trade blow for blow to the very end.  But\r\n\r\nwe  believe  that  he, despite everything,  would  not\r\n\r\nrecklessly embark on such a course. For that reason, I\r\n\r\nwish to couch my language in the course of this debate\r\n\r\nin sober terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what has happened is past. But what will\r\n\r\nhappen  after this is another matter, because today  is\r\n\r\npositively  the last sitting of this Assembly,  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  next  few  days there will be no more  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  where  questions  can  be  asked  or   issues\r\n\r\ndebated.  We were confident in November last year  when\r\n\r\nwe  moved  our  motion that there should  be  elections\r\n\r\nafter  the 2nd April, 1959; that we should dissolve  on\r\n\r\nor  before the 2nd; and I did not force the issue about\r\n\r\nthe Ministers who had been appointed, because they were\r\n\r\nMembers  of this Assembly, continuing in office without\r\n\r\nan   Assembly.   It  is  true  that  in  constitutional\r\n\r\npractice,  after  Parliament  is  dissolved,  Ministers\r\n\r\ncontinue  on a caretaker basis until the elections  are\r\n\r\nover. But when the Chief Minister said, \"I am going  to\r\n\r\nplay the game in a dirty way\", then I say we have cause\r\n\r\nto   ask   ourselves  whether  or  not,  wittingly   or\r\n\r\nunwittingly, he may, in fact, allow dirty  politics  to\r\n\r\nbe  played in this election. I indicated earlier  that,\r\n\r\nhad  we  not known what was going on, the P.A.P. would\r\n\r\nnot  have survived. Right now we know exactly  what  is\r\n\r\ngoing on, and we are, frankly speaking, disturbed  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the time comes for the final round of the contest\r\n\r\nmen  who  should  make momentous decisions  only  after\r\n\r\ncareful reflection and consideration are acting in fits\r\n\r\nof pique and anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday there was wild talk that the Minister for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government,  Lands  and  Housing  was  going  to\r\n\r\ndissolve  the City Council, because he was  angry  that\r\n\r\nsome minutes which he had demanded had not been sent to\r\n\r\nhim.  Yes. He told the Press, but he told them to  keep\r\n\r\nit  quiet and confidential. One reporter did not,  much\r\n\r\nto  the chagrin of the reporter of the other paper  who\r\n\r\ndiscovered he had been scooped the next day.  But  even\r\n\r\nthis paper did not disclose the full extent of this mad\r\n\r\ntalk.  I do not believe even now that the Minister,  on\r\n\r\nsober  reflection, would wish to take such a  momentous\r\n\r\ndecision  so  light-heartedly. Even if he  did,  it  is\r\n\r\ndoubtful whether his other Ministers would acquiesce in\r\n\r\nthat decision. Even if they did, it is doubtful whether\r\n\r\nthe ultimate official responsible, namely, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor, will be a party to it. Therefore, if and when\r\n\r\nthat  happens, we must assume that all have  acquiesced\r\n\r\nin that, and have calculated the consequences. What are\r\n\r\nthe  consequences? If nothing happens between  now  and\r\n\r\nNomination  Day and between Nomination Day and  polling\r\n\r\nday, then I say the odds have already been settled. But\r\n\r\nwhat  I  fear  is that people in moments  of  impending\r\n\r\ndefeat  act  like desperadoes. They might dissolve  the\r\n\r\nCity Council in the hope that there might be some civil\r\n\r\ncommotion which will give them a magnificent excuse why\r\n\r\nvotes  should not be cast and the elections  postponed.\r\n\r\nAll   this   becomes  very  dangerous  and  unpleasant,\r\n\r\nbecause, technically speaking, it is no breach  of  the\r\n\r\nconstitution for this Government to carry on until  the\r\n\r\n2nd  of  July, three months from the date of compulsory\r\n\r\nautomatic dissolution of this Assembly, namely, the 2nd\r\n\r\nof April, bringing it to the 2nd of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November, when I moved my motion, we were\r\n\r\nconfident   that,  whatever  their  shortcomings,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the Ministers would play  according  to\r\n\r\nthe  rules of the game. Frankly, now I am not so  sure,\r\n\r\nnot  because we think that we would lose if it  is  not\r\n\r\nplayed according to the rules of the game. However  the\r\n\r\ngame  is played, I believe the result is the same.  But\r\n\r\nif the game is played the dirty way, then the aftermath\r\n\r\nis  unpleasant. I do not, for one moment, suggest  that\r\n\r\nthere  are going to be trials as what happened in  Cuba\r\n\r\nor  in Baghdad, but if people get injured - as they were\r\n\r\ninjured  in  Kallang;  two of  my  Party  members  were\r\n\r\nstabbed - well,  if they were killed in  outlying  areas,\r\n\r\nthen a lot of unpleasantness must follow. And we do not\r\n\r\nwant Castro trials here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore ask the Chief Minister whether he would\r\n\r\nnot  seriously  consider that, in view  of  the  public\r\n\r\nalarm  which he has caused by what he said at the  last\r\n\r\nsitting,  he  and  his  Ministers should  vacate  their\r\n\r\noffices during the period of the elections. Sir, let us\r\n\r\nbe  honest  and  realistic about it. We know  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  are hard-working men, but we also know  that\r\n\r\nthe administration will carry on exactly the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout them. The Chief Minister is looking after three\r\n\r\nportfolios - Chief  Minister,  Minister  for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nWelfare, and Minister for Education. I do not think the\r\n\r\nschools  have suffered as a result of the loss  of  the\r\n\r\nformer  Minister  for Education. Another  Minister  was\r\n\r\nwell  enough  to  attend  a banquet  for  the  Duke  of\r\n\r\nEdinburgh  but not well enough to attend a  sitting  of\r\n\r\nthe   Assembly.  He  recovered  well  enough  to  issue\r\n\r\nstatements  to the newspapers, but not well  enough  to\r\n\r\nattend the final sitting of this Assembly. Nobody is in\r\n\r\nany  doubt  that,  because of the  heavy  stresses  and\r\n\r\nstrains on his nervous system over the last four years,\r\n\r\nit  would be unkind to expect him to do much work now.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would suggest that if not much work anyway\r\n\r\ncan  be  expected before Nomination Day,  certainly  no\r\n\r\nwork  at  all  is  possible after Nomination  Day  when\r\n\r\nelectioneering proper begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no objection to the Minister taking leave\r\n\r\nwith full pay prior to retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Very generous!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There is the illustrious example of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya.

If that is not possible, then I say, much  as\r\n\r\nI  detest having to say it, that the driving instructor\r\n\r\nshould  put  the brakes on, because the pupil  has  not\r\n\r\nlearned  in four years and it is reckless to allow  him\r\n\r\nto career along the public highways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say point-blank that had our survival as a Party\r\n\r\nand  as  a  movement  depended on the  wisdom  and  the\r\n\r\njudgment  of our illiterate Ministers alone,  we  might\r\n\r\nnot  be here today to make this plea for clean and fair\r\n\r\nelections. I would say, having decided to allow  us  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  right  up till now, it is  the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\ndriving  instructor  to see that the  driving  is  done\r\n\r\naccording to the Highway Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Ministers continue - I do not say that they\r\n\r\nthemselves  will  indulge in any  illegal  or  unlawful\r\n\r\nactivities -  there  are bound  to  be  cases  of  minor\r\n\r\nmisuse, and sometimes major misuse of power. I  give  a\r\n\r\nsimple  illustration. The Chief Minister at the Kallang\r\n\r\nby-election  was  moving  in and  out  of  the  polling\r\n\r\nstations with ease to supervise and see how the polling\r\n\r\nwas  going on. I was the election agent of my candidate\r\n\r\nand  I  could not enter the polling stations.  That  is\r\n\r\njust a minor instance. I do not suggest that he went in\r\n\r\nand coerced anybody to vote for his side. But I did see\r\n\r\nhim enter the polling stations, something which I could\r\n\r\nnot  do, even as an election agent. I happened  to  see\r\n\r\nit,  Sir. Election agents were not allowed to enter.  I\r\n\r\nwas  an  election agent, too, and I was not allowed  to\r\n\r\nenter.  We  all  know  that, however  impartial  police\r\n\r\nofficers  are,  if  Ministers turn  up  at  the  police\r\n\r\nstation  on  behalf of the people in the lock-up,  they\r\n\r\nare bound to be polite, because it is their duty to  be\r\n\r\npolite. I am not suggesting that the Ministers will  do\r\n\r\nit,  but  I  am seriously suggesting that some  of  the\r\n\r\ncharacters  to be found in not too distant  association\r\n\r\nwith  some  Ministers are quite capable of doing  these\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I say nothing is lost if they publicly\r\n\r\ndivest  themselves of their power, positions and  their\r\n\r\nprestige  and influence by vacating their office  until\r\n\r\npolling day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would remind the Chief Minister about this. He\r\n\r\nhas  indicated to me that he is prepared to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nliaison  committee  as a guarantee of  fair  play.  The\r\n\r\nChief   Secretary  shall  be  the  Chairman   of   that\r\n\r\ncommittee,  and each Party in this Assembly shall  have\r\n\r\none  representative  with direct access  to  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  on  all  complaints  of  partiality  by  the\r\n\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is prepared to go thus far; if he is prepared\r\n\r\nto  acknowledge that, in fact, there is concern because\r\n\r\nof  his intended or unintended remarks, then I say, let\r\n\r\nus   publicly  take  a  position  which  is  not   only\r\n\r\nunassailable but appears manifestly to be unassailable.\r\n\r\nIf  they  vacate their office or give us an undertaking\r\n\r\ntoday\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat they will take leave after Nomination Day, then  I\r\n\r\nam quite prepared to accept that.

I asked  myself\r\n\r\nwhat was the purpose of the Member for Tanjong Pagar in\r\n\r\nmoving this motion at this juncture? I tried to analyse\r\n\r\nthe  reasons, like a surgeon undertaking a post-mortem.\r\n\r\nWhat  makes  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture  want  to shorten the life of  the  Government\r\n\r\nwhen  it  has got a few more days to go? We  know  that\r\n\r\nGovernment is committed to hold the elections - if  I  am\r\n\r\nwrong,  I  hope  the Chief Minister will correct  me - on\r\n\r\n31st May. Sir, I came to the conclusion that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar  is again seeking  to  turn  public\r\n\r\ninterest away from a matter which is concerned with the\r\n\r\nnational  movement of our country. Sir, the man-in-the-street in every nook and corner of Singapore knows  too\r\n\r\nwell  that  the  $500,000 story is already  a  foregone\r\n\r\nconclusion. Sir, the public seem to have lost  interest\r\n\r\nin the disclosure of the $500,000 gift, but the general\r\n\r\ntopic  after the disclosure of 4th March is whether  it\r\n\r\nis  true  or  false  about the meeting  on  the  famous\r\n\r\nsubversive clause 30 which bars the ex-comrades of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. from taking part in the elections. Sir, I regret\r\n\r\nthat  the ex-Member for Cairnhill is not with us today.\r\n\r\nThe accusation of double-crossing was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactually  raised  by  him.

The  ex-Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The P.A.P., it is notorious, is extremely anxious to\r\n\r\ndeprive  its  left  wing of the  very  people  whom  it\r\n\r\npretends to befriend.

Members can recollect the  reply\r\n\r\nfrom  the Member for Tanjong Pagar. At column  1738  of\r\n\r\nHansard, Volume 2, No. 24, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I think he understands that when serious charges of\r\n\r\ndouble-crossing,  charges  that  we  have  cheated  the\r\n\r\npeople, most of the people, most of the time...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  was the answer to the accusation of the ex-Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me the purpose of the motion in the name of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar is mainly to switch public\r\n\r\nnotice  from the famous by-election. Sir,  if  a  smear\r\n\r\ncampaign is going on, you can even say that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Changi receives money from American capitalists and\r\n\r\nChinese Communists and that he is a political bankrupt!\r\n\r\nMaybe this is the only time for me to move an amendment\r\n\r\nto the motion to read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That, in view of the public disgust and loss of\r\n\r\npublic confidence in the Member for Tanjong Pagar as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of recent disclosures, this Assembly calls  for\r\n\r\nthe  immediate  resignation of the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But,  Sir, I know that you will rule out this amendment\r\n\r\nand  therefore  it is useless for me to seek  political\r\n\r\ncapital at the expense of the Member for Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of national unity, I do not intend to move\r\n\r\na motion censuring the Member for Tanjong Pagar.

Unemployment  is\r\n\r\nincreasing.

Sir,  unfortunately,  two  years  ago,  the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  and\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister was too good. They went hand in hand\r\n\r\nto  bring  back  the famous clause 30, and  if  I  were\r\n\r\nseeking  more  political capital, I would also  censure\r\n\r\nthe Member for Havelock who was also connected with the\r\n\r\nfamous  clause 30. But, Sir, I do not wish to do  that.\r\n\r\nFor  the  last four years, I learned nothing  from  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"..one thing we never unlearn is that if you want to\r\n\r\nbe a force, you have to be clean.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  from Hansard, Volume 3, No. 24, column  2177,\r\n\r\nbut  now I begin to doubt the cleanliness of the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar when he double-crossed in respect of\r\n\r\nthe famous clause 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, it is the duty of the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar to prove how clean he is, how the disclosure came\r\n\r\nbefore  the  eyes of the public; because, Sir,  I  have\r\n\r\ngone  through the Hansard of the 3rd and 4th  March.  I\r\n\r\nhave  tried to trace the reason why the mover  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion moved it, yet I only found in Volume 3, No.  24.\r\n\r\ncolumn 2178:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We do not want to embarrass the whole of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  as  a  result of investigating  Mr  Chew's\r\n\r\naffairs.

Yet we have this\r\n\r\nmotion before us. This morning when the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar moved a motion, maybe he did not\r\n\r\nintend  to  link  this  motion  with  the  $500,000\r\n\r\ndisclosure.  What he is interested in is  what  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister has said, \"If he plays dirty, I will\r\n\r\nplay dirty in the coming elections.\" If that is the\r\n\r\ncase,  Sir,  what  is the extent  of  dirt  in  our\r\n\r\npolitics?  The hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  said\r\n\r\nthat  it is not a fact, yet he seems to accept  the\r\n\r\nchallenge - \"If you play dirty, I also  know  how  to\r\n\r\nplay  dirty.\"  Since  the hon. Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar is so confident in accepting the challenge of\r\n\r\n\"dirty politics\" that is coming into this Assembly,\r\n\r\ntherefore  the purpose of this motion  is  part  of\r\n\r\ndirty politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since dirty politics is coming into being, I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is best for me to give some truth  about\r\n\r\nwhat  has been going on during the last four years.\r\n\r\nThe  national aspiration of this country  has  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time  been  quoted by  various  political\r\n\r\nleaders.  In May 1956, Sir, - I hope you can remember\r\n\r\nit - on  the day when the constitutional talks  broke\r\n\r\ndown,  I  had an unexpected call that very midnight\r\n\r\nfrom the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar and the hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Timah. They kindly offered to call\r\n\r\na  Press conference for me to denounce the Lib-Soc.\r\n\r\nI can still remember the exact words of my reply. I\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"It  is  very kind of you to  make  such  an\r\n\r\narrangement. My English is no handicap to me  since\r\n\r\nI  know very little of what has happened in London.\r\n\r\nBut please allow me, after the Press conference, to\r\n\r\ndisclose  that this Press conference  was  actually\r\n\r\narranged  by  you.\"  Sir,  of  course,  this  Press\r\n\r\nconference never materialised. The hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar and the hon. Member for Bukit  Timah\r\n\r\nknew  that  I  have the prestige of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndelegation; I have the national unity of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore at heart. And I refused such  a  kind\r\n\r\noffer.  If I would kill Lib-Soc, I would be killing\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, but never in London. Sir,  that  is\r\n\r\npart  of  dirty  politics. I have another  example,\r\n\r\nSir - citizenship which was also denied, as given  in\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard  of  27th April, 1957.  We  know  that\r\n\r\ncitizenship was one of the items in the  Agreement,\r\n\r\nbut  I  never  expected that the idea  was  happily\r\n\r\nsupported by the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  to\r\n\r\noppose this item's inclusion in the agenda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The motion is moved,\".. . in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  public disgust and  loss  of  public\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Government as a result of  recent\r\n\r\ndisclosures\".  The word \"recent\",  I  take  it,  is\r\n\r\nrecent - just before the sitting today - and it  looks\r\n\r\nas though the hon. Member for Changi is making it a\r\n\r\nlittle  more recent. I suggest that he is  going  a\r\n\r\nbit  too far from the motion, and I ask him to  try\r\n\r\nand  keep as close as possible to the terms of  the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, it seems that the 1956\r\n\r\ntalks are rather far from this motion. I will quote\r\n\r\na  recent  one - I do not know how recent  you  will\r\n\r\nconsider  it - the case of Lim Ching  Joo,  a  motion\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the hon. Member for Queenstown  charging\r\n\r\nthe  Special Branch with cruelty and torture. I was\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  have  seconded  the  motion.  I   was\r\n\r\ninformed by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  that\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister said that Lim Ching Joo's wounds\r\n\r\nwere self-inflicted - a part of Communist tactics  to\r\n\r\nembarrass the Government. Sir, all these I  treated\r\n\r\nas strictly confidential. It is not our duty really\r\n\r\nto  break the rule which politicians usually  think\r\n\r\nof.  But, nevertheless, in Singapore today politics\r\n\r\nis   not   personal,   and  the   frustration   and\r\n\r\ndisappointment is widespread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back to the famous clause about the\r\n\r\nsubversive elements. The Nanyang Siang Pau and  the\r\n\r\nSin  Chew  fit  Poh gave headline  news  about  the\r\n\r\nFrench  News  Agency's  story  that  \"the  Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice  spokesman denies the meeting  took  place.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, the P.A.P. spokesman issued a statement,\r\n\r\n\"We  are  very pleased with such a denial from  the\r\n\r\nspokesman of the Colonial Office.\" Sir, why  should\r\n\r\nthe Colonial Office choose such a crucial moment to\r\n\r\ngive  our  Hon. the Chief Minister a slap,  \"He  is\r\n\r\ntelling lies!\", and the Chief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  is  hurt? Sir, to me the  appointment  of  a\r\n\r\nCommission  of  Inquiry into the $500,000  is  not  as\r\n\r\nimportant as the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\ninto  the leakage from the Income Tax Department.  But\r\n\r\nstill more important than this is the setting up of  a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry to investigate into this \"dirty\"\r\n\r\nsubversive clause. This is most important. The  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  are anxious to know how dirty  politics\r\n\r\nis, and how long politics has been double-crossing and\r\n\r\nmanoeuvring  in this country. \"We are  loyal!  We  are\r\n\r\nproud  of  our comrades in Changi Prison!\" Sir,  these\r\n\r\nare  merely  crocodile tears, and are not  from  human\r\n\r\nbeings! I have a file here; a \"Crocodile\" brand file!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I sincerely and humbly demand the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  this motion because, if  I  may  be  a\r\n\r\nlittle  rude, Sir, it is not only bad and  selfish  of\r\n\r\nthose who make it a political stunt, but the important\r\n\r\nthing is that they are seeking to destroy our national\r\n\r\nunity,      thereby     deepening     the     rift - the\r\n\r\ndifferences - among our people - between the rich and  the\r\n\r\npoor,  the  Malays and the Chinese. Do they know  that\r\n\r\nthere  might be an open clash as a result of  twisting\r\n\r\nthe charge that the U.M.N.O., which merely accused the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  are  anti-Chinese? We  know  the  P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nseeking  the  support of our Malay  brothers - once  you\r\n\r\nwear  a  songkok, then you are a Malay - to support  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O.  (Preservation of Public Security Ordinance).\r\n\r\nWoe  to the Federation of Malaya! Sir, all these  make\r\n\r\nme  think that the motive of the mover of this  motion\r\n\r\nis  most  deplorable. They are only  seeking  personal\r\n\r\nglorification  and Party interests, and  not  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare or the interests of the people of Singapore or\r\n\r\neven for a Greater Malaya as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second reason for demanding the withdrawal of\r\n\r\nthis motion is this. Do not create a bad precedent  in\r\n\r\nthe coming election campaign through this motion which\r\n\r\nis irresponsible, unfounded, and unnecessary. The life\r\n\r\nof  the  Assembly runs for only a few more  days.  The\r\n\r\ndate   of  the  general  elections  has  been   agreed\r\n\r\nunofficially. And yet we have this motion! I quote one\r\n\r\nexample.  I attended one election rally of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand I heard the speech of one P.A.P. speaker,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin, the General Manager of the Overseas\r\n\r\nAssurance  Company Limited. He accused the  S.P.A. of\r\n\r\nbeing   supported  by  capitalists  from  abroad   and\r\n\r\nlocally.   What  is  wrong  with  the  S.P.A. boxing\r\n\r\nsupported  by  capitalists? As the hon.  Member  said,\r\n\r\n\"Mr  Chew Swee Kee should probably have said, 'I have\r\n\r\ngot  the money. So what?'\" It is the same thing,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwho  is Mr Yong? This may only be a coincidence. They\r\n\r\nall come from a multi-millionaire banker's family. The\r\n\r\nhon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar and Mr Yong  Nyuk  Lin\r\n\r\nare married to the same daughter - oh, no, no, different\r\n\r\ndaughter-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must from now on\r\n\r\nconfine  himself to the motion. He has kept  wandering\r\n\r\naway  ad  lib,  and I have given him  enough  rope.  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that he should now come back to the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, May I apologise? I only\r\n\r\nwanted  to  quote  an example of  the  dangers  if  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  conduct  our  political  activities   or\r\n\r\npolitical campaigns to such an extent. As a result  of\r\n\r\nthe  nature and motive of this motion, I am forced  to\r\n\r\nmention  that it is wonderful that a multi-millionaire\r\n\r\nbanker can produce two brilliant sons-in-law!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third reason for demanding the withdrawal of the\r\n\r\nmotion   is  this.  The  P.A.P. have  been  boasting,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar,  from\r\n\r\ntime to time that they are genuinely supported by  the\r\n\r\nmasses.  Therefore, they are confident they will  come\r\n\r\ninto  power and the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar will\r\n\r\nbe  Prime Minister, as we have heard this morning.  It\r\n\r\nis  my  business to know income tax. Let me take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to assess how genuinely and how  popularly\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are really supported by the masses.  They\r\n\r\ncalled  for  a boycott of the welcome to the  Duke  of\r\n\r\nEdinburgh,  which  the hon. Member for  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nthought would be fully supported and would succeed. He\r\n\r\nhas  every confidence in moving this motion to request\r\n\r\nthe Government to resign, quickly and much earlier, so\r\n\r\nthat he can become Prime Minister. Sir, I tell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou it is not that simple. The public are not so simple\r\n\r\nas  they  were a few years back. The call for a boycott\r\n\r\nof  the  welcome  to His Royal Highness,  the  Duke  of\r\n\r\nEdinburgh, was a failure. They should have learnt  this\r\n\r\nlesson  and thought over why the boycott was a failure.\r\n\r\nIt  is  because we have failed to bring about  national\r\n\r\nunity.  It is not a matter of who can become the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  We really must succeed in bringing  all  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  realise  one aim - to  achieve  our  national\r\n\r\naspiration - but  not  merely to ask this  Government  to\r\n\r\nresign  quickly so that someone can step in  to  become\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister. The whole motive  of  the  motion\r\n\r\nlooks like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the call to boycott the Duke of Edinburgh\r\n\r\ncould   be  supported  by  all  political  Parties   in\r\n\r\nSingapore in order to challenge the symbol of  colonial\r\n\r\npower,  then  what  was the result? Unfortunately,  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar can  never  see  that.\r\n\r\nNational   unity  and  national  interests   are   more\r\n\r\nimportant   than  personal  glorification   and   Party\r\n\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I wish the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  can  accept my humble advice in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  and  for the unity of  this  country,  and\r\n\r\nwithdraw  the  motion.  If not - I beg  your  indulgence,\r\n\r\nSir - maybe  I am too small to issue a challenge  to  the\r\n\r\nalmighty  hero of Tanjong Pagar - but let  me  extend  my\r\n\r\nhumble invitation to him to come to Changi constituency\r\n\r\nto  answer the accusations which I put forward today in\r\n\r\nthis  House. Let me then answer him in public.  Let  me\r\n\r\nanswer him without any protection or privilege. Let  me\r\n\r\nrepeat all the allegations, all the accusations,  which\r\n\r\nfor  years  I  have levelled at him, in  front  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  in  front  of the people  of  Changi.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nconsider  this motion selfish and unnecessary.  I  also\r\n\r\nhave  a  strong doubt as to the integrity and sincerity\r\n\r\nof  the  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar in the  national\r\n\r\nstruggle.  I now wish to withdraw the remarks  which  I\r\n\r\nmade about the hon.

He even alleged, very wrongly though,  that  I\r\n\r\nhad  indicated  to some reporters of the Straits  Times\r\n\r\nand of the Singapore Standard that I would do so. Well,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  put  matters in their proper  perspective,  I\r\n\r\nnever  said any such thing to any reporter, be  it  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Standard or the Straits Times, or  for  that\r\n\r\nmatter,  even  Moscow's Pravda. But at the  same  time,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  will  not be drawn into the P.A.P. trap  into\r\n\r\ntying my hands vis-a-vis the City Council so long as  I\r\n\r\nam  the Minister concerned. It is my duty to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  to  see  that the City  Council  is  run\r\n\r\nproperly and for the good of its inhabitants,  and  not\r\n\r\nfor  any  political Party or its stooges.  I  will  not\r\n\r\nshirk my responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the cumulative damaging effect of the\r\n\r\nvarious  actions of the present City Council since  its\r\n\r\ninception  in December 1957, and in view  of  the  many\r\n\r\nrepresentations which have been made to me from time to\r\n\r\ntime,  not  only from the general public but also  from\r\n\r\nmany\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  City Councillors themselves and from the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  Staff  Unions, I have come to  the  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  the  City  administration in  the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  Councillors has reached the  point  where  the\r\n\r\npublic interest demands serious consideration by me  as\r\n\r\nto  whether  I  should intervene or  not.  I  therefore\r\n\r\nintend  to  take  all  such  Steps  should  I  deem  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  in  the  public  interest,  irrespective  of\r\n\r\nwhether  the People's Action Party accuses me of  doing\r\n\r\nso  for  political ends or not. As far as the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party is concerned, anything we on this side  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bench  do  has a political bias - not so  with  them\r\n\r\nthough,  even when they institute a People's Court  and\r\n\r\nthe Gestapo system in the City Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, coming to the motion before the House. Why\r\n\r\nhas the leader of the People's Action Party brought  it\r\n\r\nup  at  this late stage of this Assembly's life? Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause   he  really  and  honestly  fears  that   this\r\n\r\nGovernment would play dirty politics? Does he sincerely\r\n\r\nand  honestly believe or think that we would do  so?  I\r\n\r\nwill  tell you why, Sir. The reason is this. The longer\r\n\r\nthe  elections are delayed, even for a week, mind  you,\r\n\r\nthe  worse  it would be for the People's Action  Party.\r\n\r\nThey  know this, and the leader of the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty  knows it as well as I do. We all know  that  the\r\n\r\nstock  of the People's Action Party has fallen  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket.

Well, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nonly  after my Party's all-out exposure of the People's\r\n\r\nAction Party that the people of Singapore are beginning\r\n\r\nto  realise that in the situation in which Malaya is in\r\n\r\ntoday, the word \"non-Communist\" is synonymous with pro-Communist,  and  to  me, Sir, a non-Communist  is  more\r\n\r\ndangerous than a full-blooded Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these factors, Sir, have compelled the People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  to demand an immediate election  of  the\r\n\r\nresignation of the Government. Any further delay  would\r\n\r\nnaturally  mean loss of votes to them. It  is  good  to\r\n\r\nhear  the leader of the People's Action Party say  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. will not start any riots or strikes  during\r\n\r\nthe  forthcoming  election campaign even  if  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil is suspended. In fact, Sir, only the other  day\r\n\r\nat  a mass meeting, the Member for Tanjong Pagar warned\r\n\r\nhis  supporters not to involve themselves in  any  such\r\n\r\nmonstrous occupation. In October 1956, the same warning\r\n\r\nwas  given  over and over again by the same  honourable\r\n\r\ngentleman. Then what happened? We had our riots and  we\r\n\r\nhad  our  strikes. I do not know, Sir, whether  today's\r\n\r\nassurance  by  the People's Action Party leader  was  a\r\n\r\ncoincidence.

As far as I know,  official\r\n\r\nrecords  do  not  put down such things  that  happened.\r\n\r\nOfficial records in the Colonial Office would not  have\r\n\r\nrecorded this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us here believe what the Chief Minister said\r\n\r\nand some of us know, Sir, that there can be no official\r\n\r\nrecord  in  the Colonial Office.

He just cannot contain himself. He wants to  get\r\n\r\non  that  motorcycle and make use of the power  at  his\r\n\r\ndisposal.  That, today, is exactly the  position  which\r\n\r\nthe hon.

He wants to become Prime Minister as quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar often talks and\r\n\r\nbehaves in this House and outside as if he is the equal\r\n\r\nof Nehru or Mao Tze-tung or any of the world leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often, Sir, in this House talk of Singapore as a\r\n\r\ncountry. Maybe we are setting our sights too high. Let\r\n\r\nus get down to earth and realise what we really are. A\r\n\r\ntiny speck of an island with great nations all around\r\n\r\nus. Do not let us fool ourselves into imagining for one\r\n\r\nmoment that we are a country. We are not a country. Do\r\n\r\nnot let us fool ourselves into imagining that our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in the next Government can ever be the equal\r\n\r\nof even the smallest of the Prime Ministers of the big\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we aspire to? What is our future? We went to\r\n\r\nLondon not to ask for independence, because we\r\n\r\nrecognised that Singapore as a sovereign independent\r\n\r\nnation is just nonsense. We recognise that at best our\r\n\r\nfuture lies in integration with the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya, and when we reach that goal, we just become a\r\n\r\ntiny portion of the mainland of Malaya. There will be\r\n\r\nno more nonsense about having a Prime Minister in\r\n\r\nSingapore and a Cabinet. We realise that Singapore has\r\n\r\nnot the wherewithal to become a sovereign independent\r\n\r\nnation. We realise that we can never be a country by\r\n\r\nitself. Then why should our politicians put on airs?\r\n\r\nWhy should they not get on with their real business of\r\n\r\nlooking after the community's interests? It is a\r\n\r\ncommunity, not a nation or country, though I have been\r\n\r\nguilty of using that word often in excited debates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the getting on with the business of\r\n\r\ngoverning and enhancing the interests of the people,\r\n\r\nhow much contribution to that have the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar and his Party made in the last four\r\n\r\nyears? The Member for Tanjong Pagar and his Party feel\r\n\r\nthat their elected representatives are there for\r\n\r\npolitical purposes only. They do not realise that the\r\n\r\npeople elect representatives to further the interests\r\n\r\nof the people in all fields - educational, medical, and\r\n\r\nespecially in the economic field. Until the last three\r\n\r\nor four months, I had been responsible in this House\r\n\r\nfor goading the Member for Tanjong Pagar into speaking\r\n\r\nhis mind on economic matters.

But\r\n\r\nso far, Sir, the P.A.P.'s representatives in this House\r\n\r\nhave kept aloof. I do not know why they have kept\r\n\r\naloof. Perhaps it is because they have no economic\r\n\r\npolicy or perhaps they have no inclination to\r\n\r\nparticipate in mundane matters concerning the daily\r\n\r\nlives of the people.

Now what could that political\r\n\r\npurpose be? Could it be the spread of Communism? The\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar has time and again said that\r\n\r\nhe is a non-Communist and that his Party - the remnants\r\n\r\nafter August 1957 - is non-Communist. I am inclined to\r\n\r\nbelieve him personally, Sir, that he and certain\r\n\r\nmembers of his Party are non-Communist. Then, Sir,\r\n\r\ncould the political purpose be a nationalist purpose in\r\n\r\nthe context of Singapore which is not a nation? Let us\r\n\r\ncall it \"nationalist\" for the sake of using that word.\r\n\r\nIn that case, what does nationalism demand? It demands\r\n\r\na bettering of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  economy  of the country.

Evidently today,\r\n\r\nSir,  he  has  shown that that was not his purpose.  At\r\n\r\nleast  he  claimed that that was not his  purpose,  but\r\n\r\nthat his real purpose was a sincere fear - a sincere fear\r\n\r\nof this democratic Government which has not in the last\r\n\r\nfour years used its powers as the P.A.P. has been using\r\n\r\nits powers in the City Council in the last two years!

I understand that it is the intention\r\n\r\nof  the  Chief Minister to make such a proposal  and  I\r\n\r\nwould like to make it clear at this stage that it  will\r\n\r\nbe  important, in my view, that the terms of  reference\r\n\r\nof such a Committee should be very clearly drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister intends to propose that there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a Liaison Advisory Committee on  which  all\r\n\r\nParties   taking  part  in  the  elections  should   be\r\n\r\nrepresented  and which would sit under my chairmanship.\r\n\r\nI  think,  Sir, that such a body could prove  extremely\r\n\r\nuseful  and very valuable. It could indeed do the  sort\r\n\r\nof  thing that we have recently been engaged on, in the\r\n\r\nmatter  of agreeing on the regulation of the number  of\r\n\r\nposters  to  be  used  and matters  of  that  kind.  If\r\n\r\nundesirable  practices appear  in  the  course  of  the\r\n\r\nelections,  then  that will be a very  useful  body  in\r\n\r\nwhich  it will be possible to reach All-Party agreement\r\n\r\nthat  those practices should cease. Similarly, it  will\r\n\r\nbe  a suitable body with which to maintain liaison with\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner of Police on his responsibilities, the\r\n\r\ndifficulties he is incurring, and so. Finally, it is  a\r\n\r\nbody which could act as a forum in which allegations of\r\n\r\nincidents  and so on can be aired and, one would  hope,\r\n\r\nthe truth arrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Member for Tanjong Pagar, in referring to it,\r\n\r\nsuggested - I   am   not  sure  if  I  am   quoting   him\r\n\r\nexactly - only  one  term of reference,  that  it  should\r\n\r\ninvestigate complaints of partiality on the part of the\r\n\r\nPolice. I myself, Sir, know of no ground for suggesting\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police  have  been,  or  would  be  in   the\r\n\r\nforthcoming  elections, in any way  partial.  Moreover,\r\n\r\neven  if  there  were  any occasion  for  investigating\r\n\r\naccusations  of  that kind, it seems to  me  that  this\r\n\r\nwould be a very inappropriate body to do so. Inevitably\r\n\r\nthe Parties sitting on it would be partisan and, in the\r\n\r\ncase  of at least one and possibly in the case of  two,\r\n\r\nthey  would in fact be the aggrieved Parties and  would\r\n\r\ntherefore  not  be a very appropriate body  to  sit  in\r\n\r\njudgment. I must also point out that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice  have the responsibility of enforcing  law.

The Police will do all they can\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the law is enforced, or if there  is  a\r\n\r\nbreach of it, that they bring the offenders to justice.\r\n\r\nBut  the Police in this matter are responsible  to  the\r\n\r\nLaw  itself; the power conferred upon them is conferred\r\n\r\nby  law; it is not a delegated authority, and it  would\r\n\r\nbe  quite wrong for me, as the Minister responsible, to\r\n\r\ndirect  any  particular policeman in carrying  out  his\r\n\r\nduties,  whether  it was to arrest or to  refrain  from\r\n\r\narresting anybody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only conclude, Sir, by saying that I do believe\r\n\r\nthat  a body of this kind could be very useful provided\r\n\r\nwe  all understand what its functions are going to  be,\r\n\r\nbut I do not think that its primary function should  be\r\n\r\nto  provide the answer to the question: \"quis custodiet\r\n\r\nipsos custodes?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

The\r\n\r\nLabour Front Government should have resigned when their\r\n\r\nthree  Members  left  them and  they  were  left  in  a\r\n\r\nminority. The Labour Front Coalition Government  should\r\n\r\nhave  resigned when their architect, the  former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and  leader  of  the  Party,  left  them  and\r\n\r\nresigned  his  Chief Ministership.  The  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment should have resigned when there were only 15\r\n\r\nMembers on the Government side and 17 on the Opposition\r\n\r\nside.  The Labour Front Government should have resigned\r\n\r\nwhen  there  were  only  ten  elected  Members  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment side and 15 on the Opposition side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Including the expert!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, they talked of democracy and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  government, but because of their  lust  for\r\n\r\npower, they hung on to power and position and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrew  democracy  aside. It would have been  honourable\r\n\r\nfor  any Party to go to the people and say, \"Look here,\r\n\r\nif  you want us, elect us back because we are now in  a\r\n\r\nminority  and  therefore we cannot run the Government.\"\r\n\r\nBut  with the Rendel Constitution as an excuse and  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of three ex-officio Members and four Nominated\r\n\r\nMembers,  they  carried  on the  so-called  \"caretaker\"\r\n\r\nGovernment  and it lasted from June 1956  right  up  to\r\n\r\nnow! This has not been for the benefit of Singapore  or\r\n\r\nits  people.  The  result  was  a  Budget  with  higher\r\n\r\ntaxation   to   off-set  spending   on   holidays   and\r\n\r\nentertainment. The public have to foot the bill. Let me\r\n\r\nask them:\r\n\r\nwhat is left of the prestige of the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their resignation should at least have come\r\n\r\nabout  when  the  elected Members of the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nbetrayed  their voters and left their Party.  They  now\r\n\r\ncall  themselves the S.P.A. Government. Let me ask you,\r\n\r\nSir:  how  many elected Members on the Government  side\r\n\r\nare of the S.P.A. Party label? None! There are only two\r\n\r\nelected   Members  on  the  Government  side,   Sir - the\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O./ M.C.A. - who are still with their own  Parties.\r\n\r\nThe others are not, and therefore the Government has no\r\n\r\nbusiness  to  carry on as the Government of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe public have lost confidence in them and the test is\r\n\r\nvery  near, not far away. I am sure that if they  stand\r\r\n\r\nfor  elections, they will lose their deposits,  because\r\n\r\nthe  voters today are conscious. They know who and  who\r\n\r\nhas  done what and what, and which Party has done  most\r\n\r\nfor  their  benefits. They are not going to  be  bought\r\n\r\nwith a flush of money this time. Those days are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is this: if the Government resigns,\r\n\r\nwho  is  going to run the Government? May I  ask  this?\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Ministers were away, either on  holiday,  on\r\n\r\nbusiness or on leave, who ran the Government? And  this\r\n\r\nhas  happened very often. The Government was run by the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretaries, and there were also  three  ex-officio  Members. They could run an interim Government.\r\n\r\nWe  could  also have an All-Party Government  say,  one\r\n\r\nMember from each Party, or something like that. But  it\r\n\r\nis not fair that the Members of the present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment should stick to their posts after the 2nd of\r\n\r\nApril  next  when this Assembly is dissolved,  for  the\r\n\r\nsimple reason that they no longer represent the people.\r\n\r\nThe  second  reason  is that the other  day  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister talked about playing dirty politics.  Sir,  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and I on this side of the House have  never\r\n\r\ntried  to play the fool with one Party or the other  as\r\n\r\nthe    Labour    Front   Coalition    Government    had\r\n\r\ndone - friendship and breaking with the P.A.P. We are not\r\n\r\nthrowing  mud at either of them and it is for  them  to\r\n\r\nsettle  the business of the disclosures that have  been\r\n\r\nmade.  As  a  Party, we feel that the coming  elections\r\n\r\nshould be clean and honest, without the Ministers using\r\n\r\nany   influence  in  their  canvassing.  Sir,  if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not accept this motion, I request  His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Governor - not only him, Sir, but  I  also\r\n\r\nrequest Mr Lennox-Boyd, the Secretary of State - that as\r\n\r\nthis  is  the first election of the State of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhen all the Members of the Assembly will be elected by\r\n\r\npublic  franchise, please assure us clean elections  by\r\n\r\nnot  allowing  any Ministers to use their influence  on\r\n\r\nthe voters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that the S.P.A. is dead. We do not want\r\n\r\nto  flog  a dead horse. It is no use, the public  knows\r\n\r\nit.  And  in  order that clean elections  may  be  held\r\n\r\nwithout any influence by anyone, I would like,  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of my speech, to move an amendment to this motion.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that the amendment will be acceptable to  both\r\n\r\nsides  of  the  House, especially the  leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and that of the Government, because  it  is  in\r\n\r\nfairness  to the general public as a whole. The  public\r\n\r\ncould  then vote without influence by anyone or by  any\r\n\r\nParty  remaining in office. I am rather surprised  that\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar was rather sober  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech when he moved his motion; possibly he still\r\n\r\nhas some love for the Chief Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other day in one of the recent Assembly\r\n\r\nsittings, I said I might move a motion. I did not do so\r\n\r\nas  it  will  be  the  duty of the next  government  to\r\n\r\ninquire  into the assets of Ministers, etc. I now  wish\r\n\r\nto  make a passing remark as to why I did not bring  up\r\n\r\nthat motion.

This\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  have died,  because  they  had  ten\r\n\r\nelected  Members against fifteen elected, or 15 Members\r\n\r\nagainst 17 Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the unfortunate thing is that all that he has\r\n\r\nspoken  on just now and all that he has been  speaking\r\n\r\non time and time again has just disclosed a lamentable\r\n\r\nignorance  of constitutional law. I am Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nnot  because of SPA. I am Chief Minister because I  am\r\n\r\nable  to  have the confidence of the majority in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  and  by  virtue of that I am  Chief  Minister,\r\n\r\nwhether I am in the Labour Front, the SPA or any other\r\n\r\nparty.  By  virtue  of  my  being  able  to  get   the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of  the majority of the  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I  remain  Chief Minister. He  could  have  me\r\n\r\nremoved  in 1956, or even much earlier than  that.  He\r\n\r\ndid not do so because he knew he was not strong enough\r\n\r\nto  do so. Then why must he feel a bit sorry? One must\r\n\r\nnot worry about the bleatings of a weak man during the\r\n\r\nlast  few  days of his membership in this Assembly.  I\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir,  so many years ago when  he  was  then\r\n\r\ncontesting the elections, the poor hon.

He said: \"Please, Lim Yew Hock, tolong la,\r\n\r\nsaya  tidak  boleh  menang, tolong, tolong.\"  I  still\r\n\r\nremember  the date. But let it be. That is all  right.\r\n\r\nEven now, Sir, I do not know who is the leader of  his\r\n\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

Member for Telok Ayer moves  an\r\n\r\namendment  without anybody wanting to  second  him,  I\r\n\r\nthink, in a democracy, if a man just shouts and shouts\r\n\r\nalone, he is therefore useless and not wanted. That is\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague, the Chief Secretary, has\r\n\r\nexplained  to this House how he proposes to have  that\r\n\r\ncommittee working in liaison with him.

The mover of\r\n\r\nthe  motion has said that he hoped he would set a more\r\n\r\nserious tone in this debate, and for that I thank him.\r\n\r\nI shall see to it that whatever I say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be in a more serious tone, and that it  should\r\n\r\nnot only be serious but should also be truthful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot understand the reason why the hon.

I wondered  why\r\n\r\nit was necessary for the mover of this motion to table\r\n\r\na motion here like this, and to call on the Government\r\n\r\nto   resign   when,  constitutionally  speaking,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment remains in a caretaker capacity  until  the\r\n\r\nnext  Government  comes in. But  now  I  know.  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  of the unfortunate words I used, and  I  must\r\n\r\nadmit that those words were unfortunate. But you  must\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Sir, at that time when I said  all  those\r\n\r\nwords, I was really greatly distressed. I will try not\r\n\r\nto  be  distressed again and I will be careful of  the\r\n\r\nwords I use so that hon. Members may not have any more\r\n\r\nfears  as to what I mean and as to what I do not mean.\r\n\r\nI think he made a reference to those few words of mine\r\n\r\nwhich  were  spoken under great stress. Let  me  quote\r\n\r\nfrom  Hansard,  Volume  3, No.  24,  columns  2164  to\r\n\r\n2165 - just one sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If one side can play dirty and begin to be dirty, I\r\n\r\nshall  play the same game and do it too, and  let  the\r\n\r\ncountry and the world and God decide.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  I did later on in my speech qualify what I meant\r\n\r\nby  dirtiness. I said the hon. Member was dirty to the\r\n\r\nextent  that  he  broke a promise. Therefore,  to  the\r\n\r\nextent that he broke a promise, I will break mine, and\r\n\r\nlet  God decide whether I am dirty or he is dirty,  or\r\n\r\nwhether we are all dirty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> God forbid to say!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister, Minister for Labour and Welfare and Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Then I went on to explain, well,\r\n\r\nshall we say, at that time I was really distressed and\r\n\r\nsaid: \"Now, Sir, the subversive clause was put in as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the hon. Member and I seeing the Secretary\r\n\r\nof State for the Colonies.\" He said it was a downright\r\n\r\nlie, and he was called to order, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  not  allowed to say more. I also did not  say  any\r\n\r\nmore.  I  left  it  at that because suddenly  I  became\r\n\r\nsober.  If one can be dirty, I think it is quite  right\r\n\r\nthat  the other side should not be as dirty or dirtier.\r\n\r\nIf  a  little  bit  dirty, tidak apa (never  mind).  It\r\n\r\ncannot be helped. You have already lost your head.  You\r\n\r\nhave said it. Let it be. Now, I must ask two questions.\r\n\r\nWhat  did I mean by the word \"dirty\"? What I meant  was\r\n\r\nthat  since he could break his promise given to  me,  I\r\n\r\ncould  jolly well break my promise given to  him.  That\r\n\r\nwas  all. To that extent, the word \"dirty\" in my speech\r\n\r\nshould be qualified. Nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been in office as Chief Minister since 1956,\r\n\r\nand, indeed, I am rather proud of my record. No one can\r\n\r\nsay  that  I  have been dirty in my dealings  with  the\r\n\r\npublic,  not  even with the Members of the  Opposition.\r\n\r\nNot   at   all,  Sir, In  fact,  I  have   been   most\r\n\r\naccommodating. I have helped the Opposition to survive.\r\n\r\nIf  I had not done so, I do not know how the Opposition\r\n\r\nwould have been able to survive until today. Would  you\r\n\r\ncall that dirty politics? Definitely no. It is not only\r\n\r\nclean  politics but it is politics of the highest order\r\n\r\nto  help even your Opposition to survive! And yet  they\r\n\r\ncrow today and say they are going to throw me out!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I was asked - let me use the proper words, which\r\n\r\nare  much better - if I would \"withdraw the statement\"  I\r\n\r\nmade  about  the secret meeting. I think I  said  about\r\n\r\nfifteen  words,  just  fifteen words.  \"The  subversive\r\n\r\nclause\"  and when I came to the word \"Colonies\"  I  got\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member's interjection and  he  called  me  a\r\n\r\n\"downright  liar\". Then you pulled me up  to  order.  I\r\n\r\nonly said about 15 words, Sir. But the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  in his reply, I think, said  about  150\r\n\r\nwords. I am still satisfied with my 15 words.

Member himself  had\r\n\r\nused  about 150 words to say that I was wrong. Then  in\r\n\r\nthat debate last month, I really learned something from\r\n\r\nhim.  Let  me see. Here it is. He was saying about  Mr\r\n\r\nNewell.  This  is what he called in Latin,  \"Suppressio\r\n\r\nyen  suggestio  falsi\".  I  throw  the  words  back  at\r\n\r\nhim - Suppressio yen suggestio falsi. I said 15 words. He\r\n\r\nsaid  150. That is all right. Let it be. Let the public\r\n\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member, Mr R. C. H.

And  it\r\n\r\nis  because, unfortunately, I had used the word \"dirty\"\r\n\r\nin  a  speech when I was really emotional that  I  have\r\n\r\nmade  the P.A.P. most unhappy and most fearful, and  as\r\n\r\nthey say, fearful that I will be really dirty. One must\r\n\r\nnot  judge  a man by just what he has said. One  little\r\n\r\nslip  should  not, and must not, damn  him.  Judge  his\r\n\r\nactions  for  the past three years.

In fact, I am  so\r\n\r\nproud that I can go to the polls tomorrow and say:  \"On\r\n\r\nmy record I come back to you as I am.

Nor can we achieve anything  if  we  are\r\n\r\ndominated  by  the  equally senseless  consequences  of\r\n\r\nsenseless fear, and that is the vain conceit  that  our\r\n\r\nown  person, our own Party, our own community or  class\r\n\r\ncontains  in  itself all that is wise and all  that  is\r\n\r\ntrustworthy and all that is worth while. It is not  so.\r\n\r\nI  disagree with many people, but I always recognise in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  that they have some good intentions and that they\r\n\r\nhave  some wisdom; and we must all recognise  that.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt  we  shall  often profoundly disagree.  We  shall\r\n\r\ncriticise  each other. We shall attack each other,  and\r\n\r\nit  is right that that should happen because it is part\r\n\r\nof the natural basis of democracy. But beneath all that\r\n\r\ncriticism and attack on the Party system there does lie\r\n\r\nan    absolutely   fundamental   sense   of    national\r\n\r\nbrotherhood,  a sense of mutual trust in  each  other's\r\n\r\ngood  intentions. We have got to hold fast to the faith\r\n\r\nthat  our political opponents are trying to do what  is\r\n\r\nright,  even when we are convinced, in fact, that  they\r\n\r\nare doing what is wrong. We have got to accept that, at\r\n\r\nbottom,  they too are seeking the welfare of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  not  its destruction. Any politician or  Party  or\r\n\r\ncommunity which tries to separate itself from the sense\r\n\r\nof  national  brotherhood and to retire into  suspicion\r\n\r\nand distrust and self-conceit is blind to the challenge\r\n\r\nof Merdeka.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon.

Columns 1844-5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said those words, Sir, I said them as a result\r\n\r\nof  quite long experience of politics. I quoted in  the\r\n\r\npapers  recently from another speech of  mine  about  a\r\n\r\nyear  later,  1957,  when  we  debated  corruption  and\r\n\r\npolitics  where I said that I had seen a good  deal  of\r\n\r\nthe dirty side in the political life in Singapore, that\r\n\r\nis,  mixed up with quite a number of dirty politicians;\r\n\r\nsome,  I was happy to say, had crossed out of political\r\n\r\nlife, others are still with us. I said it had not  been\r\n\r\npleasant but I saw no alternative and that is  a  fact.\r\n\r\nWe  have to live together in Singapore whether we  like\r\n\r\nit  or  not. If we do not live together, we  shall  die\r\n\r\ntogether.  Anybody  who builds up sectional  fears  and\r\n\r\ndistrust is doing a very grave disservice to Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  was partly because of that that I thought the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister was going far down that path. In view of  what\r\n\r\nhis  Party had sat down beforehand, I crossed the Floor\r\n\r\nof  this House, because I felt that he was going beyond\r\n\r\nthe  point  at  which the national interests  could  be\r\n\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this debate we heard a great deal of distasteful exchanges and I do not want to add to them.\r\n\r\nBut  I  must try to justify the point of view which  my\r\n\r\nParty  has put forward and which I myself have said.  I\r\n\r\nam  not trying to make any innuendo or to say any  more\r\n\r\nthan  precisely what I say. But if I do appear to  make\r\n\r\nany  innuendo, Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that  you  will\r\n\r\nstop  me  and I shall welcome your stopping  me  and  I\r\n\r\nshall  apologise sincerely. I am not trying to say  any\r\n\r\nmore  than  precisely what I say and  I  am  trying  to\r\n\r\nchoose my words with the greatest care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe that there has been some loss of\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Government. On the 3rd of March,  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Queenstown spoke to the effect that  it\r\n\r\nwould be a very good thing if foreign investors in  the\r\n\r\ntransport industry had their legal position taken away;\r\n\r\nand we have not yet had any categorical denial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom the Front Bench of the Government. The Front Bench\r\n\r\nof   the   Government  has  not  said  that   that   is\r\n\r\nemphatically  not  their policy and that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion at all of depriving foreign investors  of  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  the  law. I do not believe  it  is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Chief Minister or any other  Minister\r\n\r\nto  deprive foreign investors of the protection of  the\r\n\r\nlaw. But they had not, as a Party, nor as a Government,\r\n\r\nbeen  able, in fact, to control one of their own  party\r\n\r\nmembers,  one  of their own Government supporters,  who\r\n\r\nwished  to say that for what reasons he best knows.  He\r\n\r\nhas  said  it  and that word can be quoted  by  anybody\r\n\r\nagainst   Singapore  to  frighten  away   any   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestor, and the Government has not been able even  to\r\n\r\nrepudiate  it  as a policy, let alone  to  control  him\r\n\r\nbeforehand and prevent him from saying it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> If the hon. Member is referring to\r\n\r\nwhat  I said, as far as I can recollect, I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  ever referred to foreign investments  in\r\n\r\nthis country in my speech on 3rd March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not think that we need debate it\r\n\r\nagain,  Sir. The hon. Member's speech was to the effect\r\n\r\nthat  the Singapore Traction Company should be  reduced\r\n\r\nto the same terms as the Chinese bus companies where at\r\n\r\npresent   it  has  a  privileged  position  under   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Traction Ordinance. I was perfectly aware  of\r\n\r\nwhat  he  said, and the implication obviously was  that\r\n\r\nthey  were expatriate capital and therefore they should\r\n\r\nnot  be  protected  by the Ordinance under  which  they\r\n\r\nbuilt up their company, established their interests and\r\n\r\nprovided transport services to Singapore. It is a  very\r\n\r\narguable point of view, but it is not a point  of  view\r\n\r\nwhich  is going to serve Singapore to argue here  at  a\r\n\r\ntime when you need more employment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  not less, and where you must import capital if you\r\n\r\nare going to expand employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give that example, Sir, because if the Government\r\n\r\nFront   Bench  cannot  effectively  control  its  Back-Benchers  on matters of importance, it does  inevitably\r\n\r\nbreed  a  loss of confidence in the public, the friends\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and people overseas. It is my belief also\r\n\r\nthat  a  very  new  Party like the  Singapore  People's\r\n\r\nAlliance  inevitably has some weaknesses of control  at\r\n\r\nthe subordinate levels. The Chief Minister is, I think,\r\n\r\nthe  President of the Party as well as the head of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  I  suppose  that  on  him  falls  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the control of the Party, but I have\r\n\r\nmy  doubts. What is more, many people in Singapore have\r\n\r\ntheir  doubts  whether in fact  he  would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nexercise  control  over  the  Party  during  the   very\r\n\r\nexcitable period when the elections are coming. My mind\r\n\r\ngoes back, Sir, to the Kallang by-election when Tun Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock  was personally in control of the conduct  of\r\n\r\nthat  by-election.  I am making no innuendos,  Sir,  at\r\n\r\nall. I am simply stating a simple fact that there was a\r\n\r\ncriminal  assault on some P.A.P. workers in  the  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar  area;  that apparently the thugs  who  made  the\r\n\r\nassault   travelled  in  a  Labour  Front  office   car\r\n\r\nregistered in the name of the Labour Front to  be  lent\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of that by-election, and that that car\r\n\r\nwas held by the Police for some weeks for investigation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I do not know whether the hon.\r\n\r\nMember is blaming the Government for that incident, but\r\n\r\nthe  motion is merely a motion asking for the immediate\r\n\r\nresignation of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I am trying to deal with\r\n\r\nthe  loss  of  public  confidence.  The  point  of   my\r\n\r\nreference was that as soon as that telephone call  came\r\n\r\nto  me, I had other people asking me, \"Is it true?  Has\r\n\r\nthis  been  done?\"  I  do  not  say  that  it  has  any\r\n\r\nconnection at all. As far as I know, the incident  took\r\n\r\nplace  in or near some liquor shop and it may  well  be\r\n\r\nnothing more than a brawl over a bottle of beer. What I\r\n\r\nam  saying  is  that the public mind is  disturbed  and\r\n\r\nthose who remember the Kallang by-election will believe\r\n\r\nthat  this was a political assault; and that, Sir, does\r\n\r\nindicate  a  very  grave  loss  of  confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I am not wishing to link in  any  way  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister with this incident or with the  earlier\r\n\r\nincident. I am only saying that he has not, in my view,\r\n\r\ngot  full control of some of those who wish to  act  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of his Party. He apparently had not  got  full\r\n\r\ncontrol  over Mr Chew Swee Kee. I do not  wish  to  go\r\n\r\ninto this thing at great length, but Mr Chew Swee  Kee\r\n\r\napparently had $500,000. I knew nothing of it until  it\r\n\r\nwas  revealed in the Press, but apparently  the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nknew  nothing  about  it. Mr Chew  Swee  Kee  was  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education of the S.P.A. and was a  member\r\n\r\nof the Party, and apparently was not sufficiently under\r\n\r\ncontrol to let the Government know what he was doing or\r\n\r\nlet  the  Party know or let anybody know  that  he  was\r\n\r\napparently acting in the name of the Party, or else his\r\n\r\nfunds  would  have been subject to tax. The  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  they were Labour Front funds is merely ludicrous.\r\n\r\nEveryone  knows  that the S.P.A. took a  long  time  in\r\n\r\nactually  achieving birth and that it was substantially\r\n\r\nformed  some  months before the formation was  publicly\r\n\r\nannounced.  The suggestion that Mr Chew Swee  Kee  was\r\n\r\ncollecting  funds  for  the Labour  Front  and,  having\r\n\r\ncollected the funds, he suddenly changed his  mind  and\r\n\r\njoined the S.P.A., is just absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there again there is a lack of control within\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and the Party and that  is,  I  think,\r\n\r\ndangerous because if a wrong action does take place  at\r\n\r\nsome  subordinate  level without the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nheads  of the Party or of the Government, nevertheless,\r\n\r\nonce the action has occurred, it will be very difficult\r\n\r\nfor  them  to disown it and to try to take  the  strong\r\n\r\naction  that  ought to be taken, to try to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  man who has done wrong is not in any way protected\r\n\r\nbut  that he should receive, if anything, more rigorous\r\n\r\ntreatment because he has abused a position of trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very happy, Sir, when the Chief Minister said\r\n\r\nthat  his unfortunate remarks on 4th March were not  an\r\n\r\noverall intention to countenance dirty politics  or  to\r\n\r\nuse  dirty political methods, but that they were merely\r\n\r\nspoken  in  a sense of distress at a time when  he  was\r\n\r\nunder great stress and that he was only referring to  a\r\n\r\nparticular thing that he was going to do. He felt  that\r\n\r\nthe  leader of the P.A.P. had said something he  should\r\n\r\nnot;  so  he was also going to say something  which  he\r\n\r\nshould  not  as  well, and I hope  his  denial  of  any\r\n\r\nfurther  purpose was strong enough to leave no question\r\n\r\nin the minds of some of his supporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another aspect of confusion, as it\r\n\r\nappears to me, in the background of the S.P.A. and  one\r\n\r\nwhich  again, from what I hear, is causing  a  loss  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the wisdom of the Front  Bench  of  the\r\n\r\npresent Government. There have been references  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers to a proposed students' observation  mission\r\n\r\nto China. I know very little about it. According to the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,   the  Students'  Unions  of  the   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity and the University of Malaya said, \"This  is\r\n\r\nall  nonsense. There should not be any such observation\r\n\r\nmission organised by somebody who is not himself in any\r\n\r\nway  a student.\" The organiser, according to the Press,\r\n\r\nis  a man who has for many years worked very closely on\r\n\r\nthe  Central Committee of the Labour Front. He left the\r\n\r\nLabour Front at the time the S.P.A. was formed. Whether\r\n\r\nor  not  he  is a member of the S.P.A., he is certainly\r\n\r\nsympathetic   to  the  S.P.A. and  has   gone   around\r\n\r\ncanvassing on their behalf and he is trying to organise\r\n\r\nthis students' observation mission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  Red China. I say nothing at all against it, but\r\n\r\nif  the  S.P.A. is going to take  a  strong  anti-Communist  line,  then  I presume  they  will  have\r\n\r\nsomething  to say about this students'  observation\r\n\r\nmission.  It  is  time they did. They  should  make\r\n\r\ntheir  position clear. Are they for it  or  against\r\n\r\nit? What does it all mean? What are they trying  to\r\n\r\ndo? I do not think that they should let Mr Lee Yew\r\n\r\nSeng  try  to build up support amongst the students\r\n\r\non  the  basis of giving them a free trip to  China\r\n\r\nwhilst,  at  the same time and on the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nthey  are  attacking  them for  being  not  hostile\r\n\r\nenough towards Communists. It appears that there is\r\n\r\na  possibility of confusion of thought  over  this.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  child's play. This  is  not  sitting\r\n\r\naround a table playing cards or mahjong, trying  to\r\n\r\noutsmart  the other man. This is a time  when  very\r\n\r\ngrave decisions have got to be taken. The future of\r\n\r\n1\ufffd  million people and of many more still  to  be\r\n\r\nborn  rests on the next few months to some  extent.\r\n\r\nIt  has not been a creditable exhibition very often\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly, Sir, and it is  not  surprising\r\n\r\nthat the public do not always treat the proceedings\r\n\r\nof the Assembly with the respect that they ought to\r\n\r\nget.  The corruption debate of 1957 ought  to  have\r\n\r\nconvinced the public beyond question that all sorts\r\n\r\nof  extremely wrong things were going on  in  local\r\n\r\npolitics,  and  yet the shock of surprise  and  the\r\n\r\ntwisting  and turnings which have followed  further\r\n\r\nrevelations show that that debate made very  little\r\n\r\nimpact on the mass of the people at all. It is only\r\n\r\nnow  that they are beginning to wake up to some  of\r\n\r\nthe  possibilities  of the folly  and  muddle  that\r\n\r\npeople can create in politics. The main achievement\r\n\r\nof our recent debates has been to throw dirt on the\r\n\r\nfaces of everybody possible, to do as much harm  as\r\n\r\nwe  can to the reputations of political leaders. If\r\n\r\nthat  process goes on, as it has gone on  steadily,\r\n\r\nthe   only   result  can  be  the  destruction   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  All  the  leaders  will  be  disgraced.\r\n\r\nEverybody will say, \"For heaven's sake, let us have\r\n\r\nsomebody who has got a serious interest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  is  not merely wasting his time shouting  rude\r\n\r\nwords   like  a  street-corner  little   boy.\"   If\r\n\r\ndemocracy   breaks   down,  there   is   not   much\r\n\r\nalternative  but some less free form of  government\r\n\r\nwhich might make very deep changes in Singapore and\r\n\r\nmake  us less happy than we have been in the  past.\r\n\r\nNow,  the dirt has been cast in this debate and  in\r\n\r\nthe  last few weeks in the Press, things have  been\r\n\r\nsaid. The Minister for Local Government, Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing  first seemed to say that he would  not  do\r\n\r\nanything  to the City Council, because  they  would\r\n\r\nnot immediately send him their minutes and then  he\r\n\r\nseemed to say that he would do something to them. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know what was in mind. He did not make  it\r\n\r\nvery  clear  but at least he has not said  anything\r\n\r\nthat is going to be very reassuring to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult, Sir, for me to feel that if the\r\n\r\nGovernment remain in office for the next two months\r\n\r\nthey  will  not command the confidence of  all  the\r\n\r\npublic  in the way that they ought to. We ourselves\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly have pointed out in July 1957 the\r\n\r\nvery   great  extent  of  corruption,  wrong-doing,\r\n\r\nmalpractice  and all sorts of things  which  should\r\n\r\nnot  have occurred in elections. We have all  borne\r\n\r\ntestimony  to  it with the unanimous  vote  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. There it is in the record. But now we are\r\n\r\ncoming  to a much more important election-not  just\r\n\r\nthe Cairnhill and Tanjong Pagar by-elections-but to\r\n\r\nan  election  under  a  new Constitution  in  which\r\n\r\n320,000   new  citizens  are  to  vote;   under   a\r\n\r\nConstitution  which gives new powers  to  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant election yet. Consequently, the heat will\r\n\r\nbe  all  the  greater.  And  can  the  public  have\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  an Assembly which itself  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  all the elections hitherto have been  corrupt\r\n\r\nand  have been full of improper practices and  gang\r\n\r\nactivities and all the rest of it? Can it really be\r\n\r\nsaid. \"Well, of course, it does not apply to any of\r\n\r\nthe    Ministers   or   any   of   the   Government\r\n\r\nAssemblymen.\"? I do not think they can, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say a few brief words on the\r\n\r\nsociological background of these elections. In 1954\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front gave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits principles and aims; one of the principles was the\r\n\r\nremoval  of unjust disabilities fettering any  section\r\n\r\nof   the   population,  and  another   aim   was   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of citizenship - full political rights - for\r\n\r\nthose  who wish to make Singapore their home  and  the\r\n\r\nobject  of  their loyalty. Whilst it was expressed  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  terms,  what was in mind  obviously  was  the\r\n\r\nlarge  number of China-born Chinese who had  lived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  contributed  very notably  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  expansion and  prosperity  but  who,\r\n\r\nuntil the Labour Front wrote that down and put it into\r\n\r\npractice  as a Government policy, and secured  it  for\r\n\r\nthe  people and created a Singapore Citizenship,  they\r\n\r\nhad  no political rights. And it was the Labour Front,\r\n\r\nwith  the  assent and support of all other Parties  in\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly, which opened the door and  said,  \"Come\r\n\r\nin, brothers. Come in and join us. We are all citizens\r\n\r\ntogether,  citizens of one fair City. We are  brothers\r\n\r\ntogether; we will not keep you out any more.  Come  in\r\n\r\nand take your share of the powers, the responsibility;\r\n\r\ntake  your  full  political  rights.\"  And  they  came\r\n\r\nin - 320,000.  Well, every one can see what that  meant.\r\n\r\nit meant an enormous shift in the balance of political\r\n\r\npower.  In the past, political leadership was confined\r\n\r\nby   and  large  to  the  English  educated.  It   was\r\n\r\nnecessarily  confined in the past to those  who  could\r\n\r\nspeak  English at a fairly high level.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties  were  largely  controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  educated  and  the part  of  the  non-English\r\n\r\neducated  was  to  support the  English  educated  and\r\n\r\nsecure political power for them. But when we put  that\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  Labour  Front  in  1954  into   our\r\n\r\nprinciples  and aims, we said, \"That is wrong  and  it\r\n\r\nhas  got to stop. There must be equal citizenship  for\r\n\r\nall.\" And we said it, and we did it. It was right.  It\r\n\r\nis  not  going  to  be easy. It has made  an  enormous\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the sociological facts in Singapore is that\r\n\r\nyou  have  still  not established a  single  Singapore\r\n\r\nculture.  There  is even some cultural strain  between\r\n\r\nthe  English educated Chinese and the Chinese educated\r\n\r\nChinese - not  deep,  yet  getting  less,   I   believe.\r\n\r\nPolicies  have been sound and right; steps  have  been\r\n\r\ntaken in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast  few  years  which  have  helped  to  narrow  any\r\n\r\ndivision  and  to unify and not to split  more  widely\r\n\r\napart.  Things  have been going well. There  has  been\r\n\r\nmarked improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one controverting factor. That is the\r\n\r\nvery  rapid  expansion  of the  population.  There  is\r\n\r\ninevitably  going to be a period of reduced prosperity\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore.  The trade figures  may  improve;  the\r\n\r\nnumber of investments may improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  could relate all those remarks to  the  motion\r\n\r\nbefore the House. Perhaps the hon. Member is so  taken\r\n\r\nup with the subject that he forgets that the motion is\r\n\r\nfor the Assembly to call for the immediate resignation\r\n\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do apologise, Sir. This is a point\r\n\r\nwhich cannot be made except at considerable length. It\r\n\r\nis,  to  my  view, relevant. But if you think  it  has\r\n\r\ntaken  excessive  time, then I must  drop  it  without\r\n\r\nattempting to make it short, because to make it  short\r\n\r\nwould inevitably misrepresent the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only say that there is an aspect in the\r\n\r\npropaganda  line which has been followed, not  by  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister but by some members of his Party,  and\r\n\r\nwhich  could be damaging and could be very  dangerous,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  by seeking to drive further  apart  the\r\n\r\nChinese  educated and the English educated to cause  a\r\n\r\nsplit  in national unity. People are talking about  it\r\n\r\nhere  and there. Word comes back to me from the people\r\n\r\nwho  like to keep me informed of what is going on, and\r\n\r\nthere  is  that little feeling of doubt as to  whether\r\n\r\nthere  is  some attempt to drop back from the decisive\r\n\r\ncitizenship law, and to say, \"Well, we gave too  much.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we ought to withdraw it.\" But I do not believe\r\n\r\nthat  danger exists in any very deep sense, but it  is\r\n\r\none  point of possible explosion, and it is one  which\r\n\r\nis liable to become heated as things are said and done\r\n\r\nduring the pre-election period. If things are said  by\r\n\r\na  man speaking as an individual, then they carry  his\r\n\r\nindividual  weight behind them. If they  are  said  by\r\n\r\nanybody who has the rank of a Minister, they do  carry\r\n\r\nvery great weight with the large number\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  public,  because  the  name  of  Minister  has\r\n\r\nacquired  very high qualities of power in the minds  of\r\n\r\nthe public. Even as an ex-Minister, I get people coming\r\n\r\nto  me  and imagining that I have a quite unreal degree\r\n\r\nof  power which even a Minister would not exercise. But\r\n\r\nthey  still think that I have some power even though  I\r\n\r\nam  not  a  Minister now. And statements  can  be  made\r\n\r\nwhich, as they pass round in the coffee-shops and  come\r\n\r\nback to the plank and attap huts, are misunderstood and\r\n\r\nare  taken  as constituting statements of the intention\r\n\r\nof the authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only wish to conclude by urging that the\r\n\r\nMinisters should resign. I do not have any quarrel with\r\n\r\nthem.  I  myself resigned my Ministry with a  sense  of\r\n\r\nrelief,  and I wrote to the Chief Minister to say  that\r\n\r\nwe  had  disagreed  in  the past without  any  wish  to\r\n\r\ndisagree   again  and  there  would  be   difficulties,\r\n\r\npolitical  strains, in the future. I also said  that  I\r\n\r\nshould  remember, I did remember and I would  remember,\r\n\r\nthe  very  valuable  and courageous services  which  he\r\n\r\nrendered to Singapore in the past three years;  he  had\r\n\r\ndone  a very valuable job in many ways, and I hope that\r\n\r\nthough  there  would be disagreements, they  would  not\r\n\r\ndestroy  old  friendships - I say  that  to  all  my  old\r\n\r\nfriends  on  the Government Benches - and if I  disagreed\r\n\r\nwith  them, I would say so; and if they would say  what\r\n\r\nwas  wrong, I would try to put them right, but I  would\r\n\r\nnot  let my heart be filled with anger against them nor\r\n\r\nwill I conduct any election campaign to try to build up\r\n\r\nthe  forces  of  anger and quarrelling as  a  means  of\r\n\r\ngetting  votes.  Those  things could  be  very  bad  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and still more bad for ourselves. When I  say\r\n\r\nthe Government should resign, I see no loss to them  in\r\n\r\nresigning except perhaps a small loss of saying, \"Well,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. called on us to resign, and we  have  done\r\n\r\nwhat   the  P.A.P. asked.\"  That  I  suppose  is   the\r\n\r\ndifficulty,  but  that seems to be  the  only  possible\r\n\r\nloss.  There is no work for them to do now;  occasional\r\n\r\nroutine letters will come up for signing; there will be\r\n\r\nsome matters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich are quite a good thing for Ministers to look  at.\r\n\r\nBut  there is nothing which cannot wait for two  months\r\n\r\nor are so important that must be taken as a Ministerial\r\n\r\ndecision  of  policy.  The decisions  perhaps  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken,  but  they can be taken perfectly  well  without\r\n\r\nhaving  a  Minister's statement or the  Ministry's,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary. Then I suppose the three official  Ministers\r\n\r\ncould carry on. But I do not think the Ministers should\r\n\r\nremain  as  Ministers. There is the power and  prestige\r\n\r\nand  influence  of  Ministers during this  pre-election\r\n\r\nperiod.  Even  if they themselves are most scrupulously\r\n\r\ncareful  in  every  possible way to act  in  the  right\r\n\r\nmanner, the only result will be that they will make  it\r\n\r\nvery  difficult  for themselves to win  the  elections,\r\n\r\nbecause   they   have  to  withdraw  themselves   from\r\n\r\nperfectly harmless election activities. And in spite of\r\n\r\nthat,  there will still be many uncontrolled supporters\r\n\r\nin the background who will make use of their names, and\r\n\r\nthe  people know it. It has been done all the  time:  a\r\n\r\nman goes around and says, \"I am working for Mr So-and-so.  Do  this. Do that.\" Whether he is working or  not,\r\n\r\nnobody can tell, and until the elections actually start\r\n\r\nhe  would  not even have to show a credential from  his\r\n\r\ncandidate.  And  what can you do about it?  Nothing  at\r\n\r\nall. But  the name of the Ministry is there,  and  the\r\n\r\nname of the Minister can be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think anybody, Sir, would feel that the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  staying  in  office  serves  any   public\r\n\r\npurpose, any necessary purpose. It will be hard for the\r\n\r\npublic  to believe that if they do stay in office  they\r\n\r\nare  staying in from a sense of dedication and service.\r\n\r\nThe public will be tempted to say, \"They think they are\r\n\r\nmore likely to win the next elections if they stay  in,\r\n\r\nthan  if  they come down from their pedestals and  join\r\n\r\nthe common man, and fight the elections as common men.\"\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think it will help them at all to  win  the\r\n\r\nelections,  but I think there are dangers in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  which ought to be avoided, and I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will help to avoid them by resigning in  the\r\n\r\nvery  near  future  and standing for the  elections  as\r\n\r\nmodern citizens and not as Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis motion is an astounding one and it created so much\r\n\r\nastonishment when it was first published in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers that the people of Singapore expected quite\r\n\r\na lot of allegations against the Ministers, the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and other very damaging remarks (according\r\n\r\nto the P.A.P.) of gifts of hundreds of thousands of\r\n\r\ndollars. But up to now it has reached an absolute anti-climax. Is there any justification whatsoever for this\r\n\r\nmotion to be filed in this manner, \"That, in view of\r\n\r\nthe public disgust and loss of public confidence . .\r\n\r\n.\"? What disgust is there? What loss of confidence? The\r\n\r\nmover of the motion has not been able to cite a single\r\n\r\ncase of disgust. The only thing that has been brought\r\n\r\nup again is the question of the half a million dollars,\r\n\r\nand I would have been happy to leave it with a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry; but as the hon. Mr Francis\r\n\r\nThomas has brought it up again, I must speak on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are happy to abide by the findings of a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry, and our Party is pressing for it; and  the\r\n\r\nresult, I am sure, will be given even before Nomination\r\n\r\nDay. We are quite clear that our Party, the S.P.A., has\r\n\r\nnothing  to do with it. The only Party that has  to  do\r\n\r\nwith it is the Labour Front, and when we look upon  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances under which this money was  received  and\r\n\r\ndisclosed by Mr Francis Thomas in September 1957,  and\r\n\r\nthe  result of the receipt of that money from a foreign\r\n\r\nsource  in  order to combine the P.A.P. and the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront to fight the Liberal-Socialists, then we can  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Labour Front is and must be responsible  for\r\n\r\nthis money, and not us. And what was worse - in spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  money being used to purchase support by one  Party\r\n\r\nor  by the other, there was absolute treachery, and one\r\n\r\nParty was torpedoed. In spite of the treachery that was\r\n\r\npractised  by the P.A.P. when it made a pact  with  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front,  the Vice-Chairman of the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\ncan, in this Chamber and in the last two days, stand up\r\n\r\nand  support the very Party which has let it down. That\r\n\r\nI  cannot  understand. That is beyond my comprehension.\r\n\r\nIf we take away that item which is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  before  the Commission of Inquiry,  what  else  is\r\n\r\nthere  for the Government to answer? Mr Francis Thomas\r\n\r\nmade  the most unconvincing speech in his life in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  I do not know why he spoke without confidence\r\n\r\nand  so  shakily. Perhaps he crossed the Floor  on  the\r\n\r\nwrong premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not good at throwing wild allegations, and\r\n\r\nmaking  conjectures like the hon. Member for Changi.  I\r\n\r\nam  usually  very brief, and try to speak home  truths.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes home truths hurt. For instance, Sir, when\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Mr Speaker stopped the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  for saying that my remarks were inane,  he  said\r\n\r\nthat  my remarks were stupid. Sir, truth does hurt when\r\n\r\nit  reaches home. I want to let this meeting end  in  a\r\n\r\nspirit  of goodwill and try and keep it on the tone  on\r\n\r\nwhich it has been fought throughout today. This is  our\r\n\r\nlast  meeting here, and I hope everyone of us who  will\r\n\r\nbe  meeting again in the field of elections will do  so\r\n\r\nwith  clean  hands and good heart. Let the  better  man\r\n\r\nwin.  Do  not let us go out of the way to try and  hurt\r\n\r\nthe  other  by damaging his character. I can  tell  you\r\n\r\nfrom my own experience that that will not pay, and I am\r\n\r\nsure  the people of Singapore are much wiser than  they\r\n\r\nwere  four years ago, and will cast their votes in  the\r\n\r\nright way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what a publicity\r\n\r\nstunt  and  what a political stunt! When my motion  was\r\n\r\ndebated  yesterday and this morning, I was  accused  by\r\n\r\nthe  leader  of the PAP., the hon. Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  and  Mr Francis Thomas, that I  was  trying  a\r\n\r\npolitical  and  publicity  stunt.  My  Party  was  also\r\n\r\naccused  of  trying to have some political stunt.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir, both these Members, the leader of the P.A.P. and Mr\r\n\r\nFrancis  Thomas, know the constitution very well.  They\r\n\r\nknow the Rendel Constitution. So is there any necessity\r\n\r\nin  bringing in this motion here today? If there is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity,  is it not a political stunt of the  P.A.P.?\r\n\r\nWhy  then  accuse  me  when  my  motion  calls  for   a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry into the leakage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the debate I heard this afternoon, Sir, it\r\n\r\nappears  that Members of the Opposition have  the  same\r\n\r\nfeeling  that this motion should have been  brought  up\r\n\r\ntwo  years ago. If that is so, why is it that no Member\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition has had the courage to bring in this\r\n\r\nmotion?  If  it  is the feeling of any  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition that this motion should have been brought up\r\n\r\ntwo  years  ago, then a Member should have  brought  in\r\n\r\nthis  motion,  and then throw the Government  out.  Why\r\n\r\nwait  until  today? Again I say that it is a  political\r\n\r\nstunt because the election is coming near. It is only a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  two months away. So they say, \"Let  us  try\r\n\r\nsome  political stunt to smear our opponents\",  and  in\r\n\r\norder  to  smear  their opponents, the political  Party\r\n\r\nmight gain power. That is why this motion is brought in\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar knows very well\r\n\r\nthat if this motion were accepted, we would have to  go\r\n\r\nback   to  the  position  where  the  running  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment would be in the hands of His Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor and the three officials. Now, during the  four\r\n\r\nyears  that  he has been here, he has been against  the\r\n\r\nColonial  power,  and  he  has  been  against  Colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment. But now when elections are a matter of  one\r\n\r\nor  two  more  months, he prefers to  have  a  Colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment.  What a political stunt! What a  somersault\r\n\r\nstunt  of  the P.A.P.! Sir, the Chief Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nreply  to  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar qualified  his\r\n\r\nwords,  that \"I will also be dirty. If you  try  to  be\r\n\r\ndirty,  I  will also try to be dirty\". And he qualified\r\n\r\nthose  words by saying that \"if you, as an hon. Member,\r\n\r\ncannot  keep your promise, I will also try not to  keep\r\n\r\nmy promise, and be as dirty as you are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. are so much of a political bankrupt\r\n\r\nthat  they are afraid of this little word \"dirty\".  The\r\n\r\nChief  Minister has never indicated that  he  will  use\r\n\r\nforce  just  by his having said that word \"dirty\".  The\r\n\r\nChief  Minister has never indicated that he will arrest\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. stooges and their members. So why must they\r\n\r\nhave  that fear? Is it not a guilty conscience?  It  is\r\n\r\nonly the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccused  person; it is only the wrongdoer who  fears  a\r\n\r\nthing. If you are not a wrong-doer, and if you have the\r\n\r\ncourage,  why  then should you be afraid of  that  word\r\n\r\n\"dirty\"? The S.P.A. will never go to the polls  with  a\r\n\r\ndirty  mind.  We fight clean, and we will always  fight\r\n\r\nclean. I am quite sure every Member on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse will fight the elections clean. It was, and it is\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s motive to fight the elections dirty. They\r\n\r\nhave already fought elections dirtily, and that is  why\r\n\r\nthey  are  so  scared and so afraid that  if  they  are\r\n\r\nreally  dirty, the Government might use force on  them.\r\n\r\nIf not, why should they be afraid?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surprising that Mr Francis Thomas comes today\r\n\r\nto  say  that he supports the motion calling  upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to resign forthwith. In his statement, where\r\n\r\nhe explained in the Press why he had crossed the Floor,\r\n\r\nhe made a few remarks which I cannot understand. One of\r\n\r\nthe remarks is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I did not think it would be good for Singapore to\r\n\r\nsmash  the  then Government, which with all its  faults\r\n\r\nwas doing a good job.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  appeared  in the Straits Times of Saturday,  14th\r\n\r\nMarch,  1959. Even though he knew of the faults of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, he admitted that the Government was still a\r\n\r\ngood  Government. He, at that time, did not  intend  to\r\n\r\npress  for  the resignation of the Government.  Neither\r\n\r\ndid  he think fit to smash the then Government. Further\r\n\r\ndown, Sir, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government was already discredited; Singapore's\r\n\r\ngood name was already damaged; the Labour Front\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Not the S.P.A.-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"was already disgraced by the actions of its former\r\n\r\nleaders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, is not Mr Francis Thomas a leader of the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front? If so why did he make the statement?  If\r\n\r\nhe  then felt that the Labour Front had already damaged\r\n\r\nits  reputation, he was still a member  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront,  and a Minister of the Labour Front. Why had  he\r\n\r\nnot  called  upon his own Government at  that  time  to\r\n\r\nresign?  Why wait until today? Why support  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand try to curry favour and get married to the P.A.P.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further went on, Sir, in the same paper:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I did not think it would be good for-Singapore to\r\n\r\nsmash the then Government\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>repeating what he had said previously-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"which with all its faults was doing a good job.\r\n\r\nInstead, in January, 1958, I got Tun Lim Yew Hock  and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  other  Labour Front leaders to  promise  that  we\r\n\r\nwould  make  a  real effort to clean up the  party;  I\r\n\r\naccepted  appointment  as secretary  general  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of cleaning it up and reorganising it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Secretary-General! Is it not a very  high  appointment\r\n\r\nin  a  political Party? Is it not his  duty  then,  as\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of his own Party, to clean it up? If\r\n\r\nhe, as Secretary-General, could not clean up his Party\r\n\r\nthen, who is at fault? Why then come along now and say\r\n\r\nthat  the Government must resign, when it has  only  a\r\n\r\nmatter of one or two months to go?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, he further said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"By the middle of 1958, it was obvious that the Labour\r\n\r\nFront would not be cleaned up as promised.

Mr  Francis\r\n\r\nThomas  was a school teacher before he came into  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. After coming into this Assembly, he became a\r\n\r\nMinister,  and a Minister carries a salary of  $2,500.\r\n\r\nWas  it because of the $2,500 that he was not prepared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  resign?  If it is so, let him be frank enough  and\r\n\r\nsay so. Why wait until today? He is now of the opinion\r\n\r\nthat  if  the Government remains in office for another\r\n\r\ntwo  months  the  people  of Singapore  will  have  no\r\n\r\nconfidence   in  the  Government.  If  they   had   no\r\n\r\nconfidence in the Government, it would not have  stood\r\n\r\nuntil  today,  and if the Government can  stand  until\r\n\r\nwhat it is today, the Government will be able to carry\r\n\r\non for another two months until a new Government comes\r\n\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I certainly\r\n\r\nfeel  that this is in contrast to the City Council  in\r\n\r\nDecember  1958 when, at its last meeting, pleasantries\r\n\r\nwere exchanged. Today, Sir, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfind that there has been a lot of mud-slinging. This is\r\n\r\nnot right, and I would urge everyone of us here to try\r\n\r\nnot  to  end this meeting after this four-year session\r\n\r\non  a  note  of anger or hatred. But let  us  part  as\r\n\r\nfriends  and  go  to the elections and  see  the  best\r\n\r\npeople  win.  So far as I am concerned,  I  have  been\r\n\r\nattending many of the All-Party meetings. I think  the\r\n\r\nlast    All-Party    meeting   was   one    concerning\r\n\r\nposters-drawing up regulations for the poster campaign\r\n\r\nthat  is to come. We on this side of the House do take\r\n\r\nin  opinions of all other Parties, especially when the\r\n\r\nmatter concerns everybody. Not only did we discuss all\r\n\r\nmatters  concerning posters very sanely, but  we  also\r\n\r\ngave everybody ample opportunity to amend, add to,  or\r\n\r\nsubtract from all those regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reply to the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar's\r\n\r\nanxiety,  that in all probability things  may  not  be\r\n\r\nright with the Ministers at the helm, I would like  to\r\n\r\nsay  a  bit  more. This motion coming in at this  hour\r\n\r\ndoes  not seem right. All along throughout these  four\r\n\r\nyears there had been opportunities when the Government\r\n\r\ncould  have been opposed, and there was at one time  a\r\n\r\nreal danger of the Government toppling over should the\r\n\r\nOpposition combine their votes. We have read all  that\r\n\r\nin the papers. There was some bit of truth in what the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Ayer had said about 15 Members on one\r\n\r\nside  and 17 on the other. But I would like to  recall\r\n\r\nthose  incidents  at the time when Government  was  in\r\n\r\nreal danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has many a time been saved by the People's Action\r\n\r\nParty!  That was three years ago, two years  ago,  one\r\n\r\nyear  ago, or four years ago. There is no denial  that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanjong Pagar was a very good friend of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Havelock, and I think they  are  still\r\n\r\nvery  good  friends. I know that they  have  conferred\r\n\r\nwith  each  other on all important issues.  They  have\r\n\r\nbeen old friends; they have come to conclusions.\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  and peacefully on so many  things;  they\r\n\r\nhave  trusted  each other throughout  all  these  four\r\n\r\nyears;  there is no harm in trusting each other  again\r\n\r\nfor the next two months. I would say that trusting the\r\n\r\nMember for Havelock and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  elected Ministers would be far better than leaving\r\n\r\nmatters with the officials. I think, if the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar withdraws his motion and allows  matters\r\n\r\nto  rest  there,  it will be more in keeping  with  the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  the people of Singapore  and  his  own\r\n\r\ndesire throughout all these years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been doubts whether the elections will be\r\n\r\nfought  clean  or  dirty. I would  like  to  say  that,\r\n\r\nwhether  it be clean or dirty, it will depend upon  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  all the political parties. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  seen  fit  to appoint a committee with  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary as Chairman to look into such matters. And if\r\n\r\nall  leaders are determined and will carry  out  their\r\n\r\npromises  to  fight  the elections  clean,  then  I  am\r\n\r\ncertain there will be no dirt, or at least less dirt. I\r\n\r\nhave been really distressed by the spate of breaking of\r\n\r\npromises.  Every  time you make your  promise  to  your\r\n\r\nfriends,  you  seem  to swear by anything - probably  the\r\n\r\ncoconut palm in front of your house! And you break your\r\n\r\npromise  the  next  moment. What is said  in  the  most\r\n\r\nserious  tone  and  in moments which you  should  never\r\n\r\nforget  in all your life :s broken, just broken.  I  am\r\n\r\nalarmed  at that, and I hope that whatever new promises\r\n\r\nwe  make, we should make it a point to keep them and to\r\n\r\nhonour them. The Member for Changi has touched on a lot\r\n\r\nof  things  and on clause 30. I am touching on  it  now\r\n\r\nbecause  I  happened  to be a member  of  the  five-man\r\n\r\ndelegation. There have been many questions put to me. I\r\n\r\nhave  not  uttered a word, and I want to make it  clear\r\n\r\nhere that I am not uttering a word on that matter.  It\r\n\r\nhas  been a promise. If somebody says something, it  is\r\n\r\nup  to his own conscience to say whether it is true  or\r\n\r\nnot.  If  the other person is at the receiving end,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be up to his conscience to feel whether it  hurts\r\n\r\nor  it  does not hurt. I, on my part, will keep  to  my\r\n\r\npart of the bargain.

According to the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister,  he  and I went to  see  the  Colonial\r\n\r\nSecretary  and  we got clause 30 in. According  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon, he is keeping his mouth shut.  He\r\n\r\nis not saying anything, but we can imply the worst. Let\r\n\r\nus  get  the  facts  straight. I  challenge  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister to swear on oath that I and he went to see Mr\r\n\r\nLennox-Boyd  to get clause 30 in, or to discuss  clause\r\n\r\n30, or to see Mr Lennox-Boyd at all.

He sounded  more\r\n\r\nlike an old gypsy lady looking into the crystal ball. I\r\n\r\nwould ask him to take his crystal ball home, polish  it\r\n\r\nup, and perhaps meet us at election time at the 5\ufffd m.s.\r\n\r\nSerangoon,  as  we are going to hold an election  rally\r\n\r\nthere this Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get these facts clear. Through all the\r\n\r\ntwists and turns of the last four years, there was  one\r\n\r\nmistake  I  never  committed,  and  that  was  to  give\r\n\r\nhostages, and the Chief Minister knew that I was not  a\r\n\r\nstupid man. But he did not know that I thought that  he\r\n\r\nwas  a very wily operator and never gave him a hostage.\r\n\r\nI  think the words which he said at Queenstown, when he\r\n\r\nwent  down  to open some private meeting at  some  fire\r\n\r\nstation, and which were reported subsequently in Monday\r\n\r\nmorning's newspapers, were the absolute truth.  If  you\r\n\r\ncall  me a fool or call us fools, we will not deny  it.\r\n\r\nThat  is  true, because he was left carrying the  baby.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  make  no apologies for this. I  am  completely\r\n\r\nunabashed  that, partly from moderation of  policy  and\r\n\r\npartly   through  ability  in  gauging  our   opponents\r\n\r\naccurately, we have survived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister is different from his predecessor.\r\n\r\nHis predecessor was a flamboyant, flashy man, who likes\r\n\r\nto  shout and who likes to mess up things - very messy!\r\n\r\nThe  present Chief Minister is different. He is  quiet,\r\n\r\nsmall,   unobtrusive,  cracks  jokes,  plays  practical\r\n\r\njokes, puts balls into pockets and takes them out.  But\r\n\r\nhe  is a very deep fellow, and I knew that. I say  this\r\n\r\nto  him. I am sorry that he was left holding the  baby.\r\n\r\nBut  he  knew  very well that when he  opened  fire  in\r\n\r\nOctober 1956, he had been outmanoeuvred by the British.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the real position. From then onwards  it  was\r\n\r\ncheck  and counter check on the chess board.  Today  he\r\n\r\nknows  as  well  as  I do that we  have  been  able  to\r\n\r\nestablish a position where we can only be scrubbed  off\r\n\r\nthe race, not by him, but by the British. He could have\r\n\r\nscrubbed us out in 1957, but he did not. For that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  thank  Mr  Gerald  de  Cruz,  Organising\r\n\r\nSecretary, who advised him that he could absorb us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put the issues fairly and squarely before we\r\n\r\ngo to the polls. The Chief Minister knows we are a non-Communist  force,  in fact, a vital and  dynamic  force\r\n\r\nbetter   than   his.  But  because   we   cannot   make\r\n\r\naccommodation  for  him,  he  has,  on  the  one  hand,\r\n\r\nappeared  to smear us as Communists, and on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, tried to ask the Communists not to support us  by\r\n\r\nsaying   I   went  with  him  and  did  a   dirty   and\r\n\r\ndishonourable thing. Since he is going down anyway, why\r\n\r\nnot   bring   the  whole  house  down?  He  is   beyond\r\n\r\nredemption.  So why not implicate me? I put  the  issue\r\n\r\nvery  fairly to him. It is not sufficient to  kill  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew, because the P.A.P. is a movement bigger than\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan Yew. It has got more than Lee Kuan Yew. I say\r\n\r\nthis  too:  that if in four years he had  succeeded  in\r\n\r\nmaking a coherent group out of his collection of prize-fighters, he might have got somewhere, but he did  not.\r\n\r\nFinally cornered, he says, \"All right, on the one hand,\r\n\r\nin  fact, Lee was an anti-Communist who conspired  with\r\n\r\nme  with  the Archbishop of Colonialism\"; on the  other\r\n\r\nhand, at the end of his speech, he says, \"Ah, but watch\r\n\r\nout,  all  good nationalists! Let us come together  and\r\n\r\nbang  the  P.A.P.!\" Make up his mind. Which way  is  he\r\n\r\ngoing  to shoot? Because the Communists are not  kidded\r\n\r\nin  this. They know exactly what we are, what we  stand\r\n\r\nfor,  what  we are going to fight for. And neither  are\r\n\r\nthe British kidded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, before we depart - many of us perhaps never to\r\n\r\nreturn - that we have understood what has been happening.\r\n\r\nWhy  we  had such a motley collection of people in  the\r\n\r\nlast  Council, and why there was no improvement in this\r\n\r\npresent one. The reason was because in 1945 the Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist Party led the anti-Colonial movement, and all\r\n\r\nthose  who  hated  Colonialism were absorbed  into  it,\r\n\r\nincluding  a  number of my personal friends.  In  1948,\r\n\r\nthere was an armed revolt and they led an anti-Colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle, and we had the first assembly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  handpicked  men - weak, wishy-washy types  who  never\r\n\r\nmade  the  grade, except the Member for Havelock.  The\r\n\r\nBritish  gave a further concession in 1951. I had  the\r\n\r\nprivilege  of being an election agent for  one  of  the\r\n\r\ncandidates.  If  ever the British believed  that  these\r\n\r\nsort  of  people  were going to build  a  fortress  for\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  this part of the world, they  must  have\r\n\r\nbeen extremely stupid. But then, at that time, they had\r\n\r\nthe   Rt.   Hon.   Mr   Malcolm  MacDonald   as   High\r\n\r\nCommissioner,  and  he  praised  Bao  Dai  as  a  great\r\n\r\ndemocrat.  So I expect he believed Mr C. C. Tan  would\r\n\r\nhave been an even greater democrat. Came 1955, and they\r\n\r\nwere all swept into the limbo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front did not win because it was a\r\n\r\npowerful force. The Labour Front won on the pure  anti-Colonial, anti-Colonial stooges movement. And I will be\r\n\r\nthe first to admit that when the P.A.P. wins, it is not\r\n\r\nbecause of the strength and organisation of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nalone. Behind it lies the whole history of the struggle\r\n\r\nagainst the British, and now a struggle for the destiny\r\n\r\nof  this  country. It is no use for the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\ntrying at this stage to switch his horses and say, \"Ah,\r\n\r\nbut you know, Lee is really an anti-Communist with us.\"\r\n\r\nThe  Chief Minister fights the Communists on paper,  on\r\n\r\nbooks and manuscripts handed to him. I see all kinds of\r\n\r\nbooks when we go to conferences in his office. I do not\r\n\r\nthink that I am breaching any Official Secrets Act when\r\n\r\nI  say that one of them is called Positive Thinking  by\r\n\r\nsome moral rearmament fellow. I say that we should  all\r\n\r\ndo some positive thinking now. I have not read the book\r\n\r\nbut I am sure that it will do everybody a world of good\r\n\r\nto  read  such books. The Communists have no  illusions\r\n\r\nand  they know what the P.A.P. stands for. They do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to be told by the Chief Minister what the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis,  what its leaders believe in, and what its  leaders\r\n\r\nintend to do. In fact, they know better than the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  we stand for, and so does the British Government.\r\n\r\nIn  four  years, all the cards have been  laid  on  the\r\n\r\ntable  and  the  reason  why  I  say  there  is  now  a\r\n\r\ndistinction  between  the  British  officials  and  the\r\n\r\nelected  Ministers is because one is calculating  on  a\r\n\r\nlong-term  basis and the other is calculating  for  the\r\n\r\nmorrow. The British fully understand that we are  anti-British, that we are anti-colonialism, and that we will\r\n\r\ndo a lot of things which they will find unpleasant. But\r\n\r\nthey  also understand, whether they like us or not,  we\r\n\r\nare the only force outside the Communist group that  is\r\n\r\nable  to  muster  mass support - the only coherent  group\r\n\r\nthat  does not have to apologise for itself. No  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers in the leadership have hurled recriminations at\r\n\r\neach  other. That is the first lesson in the A.B.C. of\r\n\r\npolitics.  I  will never denounce my colleague  and  my\r\n\r\ncolleague   will  never  denounce  me,   whatever   our\r\n\r\ndifferences. Because we have a higher common  political\r\n\r\nobjective. But these people on the opposite  side  have\r\n\r\nonly  one  objective. It is not a political  objective.\r\n\r\nTheir  objective  is loot, and when  the  loot  is  not\r\n\r\nshared properly, then there is trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Chief Minister that we can go to the\r\n\r\npolls and take on any smear he wants to start. But I am\r\n\r\nglad  at  least that he realised that he spoke  out  of\r\n\r\nturn  when  he  said that he was going  to  play  dirty\r\n\r\npolitics.

They think if they knock out Lee Kuan  Yew\r\n\r\nor  besmirch him, or knock out Ong Eng Guan,  they  can\r\n\r\npack  us  up. It is not Lee Kuan Yew whom they have  to\r\n\r\nfight.  They have to fight a coherent group  which  has\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  a  movement  that has  got  people  who  are\r\n\r\nprepared to work, to make it into a movement.  And  the\r\n\r\nBritish understand this. That is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreason  why we survived. They understand that  if  they\r\n\r\nsnuff  us out, then the one decent group that has  been\r\n\r\nable  to muster and rally support and recruits will  go\r\n\r\nover. If not us, those who follow us would go over  and\r\n\r\njoin the Communists and bang the system. The fight here\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and  in the Federation  is  a  fight  to\r\n\r\npreserve the democratic system. On that we are  agreed.\r\n\r\nWe  talk  of democratic forces. Mr Chew Swee  Kee  was\r\n\r\none.  The  tragedy  of those who talk about  democratic\r\n\r\nforces in reference to anti-Communism is this: that the\r\n\r\nword   \"democratic\"  is  not  synonymous   with   anti-Communism,  because otherwise they would have  to  avow\r\n\r\nSyngman  Rhee as the most democratic man in the  world.\r\n\r\nNobody  pretends that. If you are relentlessly  pressed\r\n\r\nuntil finally you have no support but the corrupt,  the\r\n\r\ncrooked, who only want money, who are prepared  to  use\r\n\r\ntheir  power  positions  ruthlessly  to  maintain   the\r\n\r\n\"democratic\" system and suppress the Communists, then I\r\n\r\nwould say the battle is lost. The battle in Malaya  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  lost. In my opinion, whether we  succeed  or\r\n\r\nfail in the end will depend upon whether we can recruit\r\n\r\npeople into the movement. And when I say people,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot mean scallywags, rogues and vagabonds. I mean those\r\n\r\nwho  are  prepared  to  stake  their  lives  and  their\r\n\r\nenergies for a cause. If all the able people coming out\r\n\r\nfrom  your  Chinese Middle schools, from Nan  Ta,  even\r\n\r\nfrom  the  University of Malaya, opt for the  Communist\r\n\r\nmovement, then I say in ten or fifteen years' time  the\r\n\r\nbattle  is  near-lost. Then you  have  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill   shouting  about  democracy  and  democratic\r\n\r\nforce,  when  one of his supporters has just  had  some\r\n\r\ntrouble  with somebody at the Esplanade. Then you  have\r\n\r\nan  inquiry by the Elias Commission, and all  kinds  of\r\n\r\ncurious things happen. When you reach that point,  then\r\n\r\nnaked military dictatorship is upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position has been thrust upon us. If we were\r\n\r\ngiven  the choice, we would have preferred to  work  on\r\n\r\nthe  ground  for many more years to build the  movement\r\n\r\nup,  because he who runs the country and holds the  gun\r\n\r\nis at a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisadvantage.  I  explained  all  this  to  the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  in October 1956, when he opened fire  with  a\r\n\r\ndouble barrel, and he said, \"Oh, it is not the British.\r\n\r\nIt is I that is doing it.\" He took the gun and fired! I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think he knew what it was all about. I believe\r\n\r\nhe now begins to understand that he lost the propaganda\r\n\r\nbattle.  That when he opened fire and lost, his Special\r\n\r\nBranch  told him, \"They're Communists.\" The  people  on\r\n\r\nwhom he opened fire and their friends were able to turn\r\n\r\nit  and  say,  \"He  opened  fire  on  Chinese  culture,\r\n\r\ncivilization,...\" etc., etc.; till today he  is  trying\r\n\r\nto  explain that he did not do that. But the battle has\r\n\r\nalready  been  lost!  That is why  we  are  really  not\r\n\r\ninterested  in whether they call themselves  S.P.A. or\r\n\r\nany other alphabetical combination; the battle is over,\r\n\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned because the problem for us is not\r\n\r\nthe  winning of the elections but the survival  of  the\r\n\r\nsystem after having won the elections; because if we go\r\n\r\nthe road that the Labour Front, the S.P.A. and the Lib-Socs  travel, then verily we shall perish as they  have\r\n\r\ndone.  But  whatever the odds, I can assure Members  on\r\n\r\nthe  Government side of this: that what happens in five\r\n\r\nyears'  time - win  or  lose - we would  not  make  such  a\r\n\r\ndisreputable  sight. We would, if we have  to  go  down\r\n\r\nafter five years for holding the gun with the Tunku and\r\n\r\nhis  troops in the north, the Communists on the ground,\r\n\r\nthe   British  squatting  over  us,  we  would  do   so\r\n\r\nhonourably,  we  will not yelp. I have  no  desire  for\r\n\r\npower.  The last thing we want to do is to grab  power,\r\n\r\nbecause  this  is not a playful matter.  Power  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  to  be  bargained for and  handed  over  the\r\n\r\ncounter.  It  has to be fought for, held  and  won.  My\r\n\r\nhonest admission is that, although vis-a-vis the  whole\r\n\r\nlot of these so-called S.P.A., Lib-Socs, and what-have-you  can  just be knocked out with the rap of a finger,\r\n\r\nit is another thing in fighting the Communist movement.\r\n\r\nYou  do  not fight it just by guns.

And\r\n\r\nwhen  the pressure became acute, and the boat began  to\r\n\r\nsink,  even  if  he  did not do so, the  collection  of\r\n\r\nunsavoury  people in his Party surrounding his  members\r\n\r\nin  this Assembly who are all very savory people, would\r\n\r\nuse  unsavoury methods in his name. He knows that! That\r\n\r\nhappened  in Kallang. I did not accuse him of arranging\r\n\r\nfor the Labour Front car to be fortuitously loaded with\r\n\r\niron  bars and bicycle chains, and for two of our chaps\r\n\r\nto  be stabbed in Jalan Besar. I knew he had not. If  I\r\n\r\nbelieved for one moment that he had anything to do with\r\n\r\nit,  there  would have been a hue and  cry.  I  quietly\r\n\r\nacknowledged that he perhaps knew nothing about it. But\r\n\r\nthose  things were done in his name, and they could  be\r\n\r\ndone, because so-and-so could say, \"Ah, don't worry; we\r\n\r\nhave  got  the Chief Minister. He will settle  anything\r\n\r\nfor  you.\" That is a fact, and he knew it. He said, \"We\r\n\r\nnever  use  our  Ministerial  positions.\"  Perhaps  not\r\n\r\nconsciously.  We always put in favourable  construction\r\n\r\non  their actions. The Chief Minister said he  went  to\r\n\r\none polling station in the capacity of a polling agent.\r\n\r\nSir,  I think that is a very dangerous remark to  make,\r\n\r\nbecause,  to  my  knowledge, I saw  him  walking  to  a\r\n\r\npolling station, look around, and come out. And I,  the\r\n\r\nelection agent of the opposing candidate, could not  do\r\n\r\nit, because I was not a Minister! But never mind, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of today's debate only confirms what for a\r\n\r\nlong  time we have already suspected. We are not saying\r\n\r\nthat  his side consists all of evil men who want  evil.\r\n\r\nBut  I say there are many dangerous characters and,  in\r\n\r\ntimes  of  crisis, they would resort to dirty  tactics.\r\n\r\nAnd  he  will  not be able to stop them. And  he  knows\r\n\r\nthat. Sir, the point is: it is our duty to see that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhatever happens, after the elections there are  stable\r\n\r\nand  sober  conditions. The last thing we  want  is  an\r\n\r\naftermath and a blood-bath. We do not want to embark on\r\n\r\na  witch-hunt. I am pressing this point.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nlast  sitting. In the course of the election  campaign,\r\n\r\nif  my Party members are injured, fingers are cut  off,\r\n\r\nthen  it will be impossible for me - I will not be  able,\r\n\r\nnor  will my whole Committee be able - to put the  brakes\r\n\r\non; and we will then go down on the slippery slope of a\r\n\r\nwitch-hunt and a vendetta. We do not want that. That is\r\n\r\nthe  reason why I have tabled this motion. I  am  sorry\r\n\r\nthat  the  suggestion which I threw out in my  opening,\r\n\r\nthat they should vacate their office on leave prior  to\r\n\r\nretirement, during the course of the election campaign,\r\n\r\nwas  not accepted. I did not want to press this  motion\r\n\r\nif  I  could have a reasonable assurance that, in fact,\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  no Ministerial use  of  prestige  and\r\n\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am sorry to say that the conduct of the Deputy\r\n\r\nChief  Minister leaves a very big question mark  in  my\r\n\r\nmind.  I  know he is not here; he is a very  angry  man\r\n\r\nsulking  away in the C.P.A. Room. He is very angry  and\r\n\r\nvery  sulky because he believes, just because he and  I\r\n\r\nare  also  good  friends, that I should not  state  the\r\n\r\ntruth.  He has good qualities, but he has one  failing,\r\n\r\nand  that  is, he gets angry and talkative.  He  denied\r\n\r\nthat  he  told  the Press this, but after  I  made  the\r\n\r\nstatement this morning - I do not want to be involved  in\r\n\r\nanother  expose and prove the man a liar; nobody  gains\r\n\r\nby that - he knew as well as anybody else that there were\r\n\r\ntwo  people in the Gallery this morning (one  from  the\r\n\r\nStraits   Times  and  the  other  from  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nStandard) who confirmed at the lunch interval  that  he\r\n\r\nhad indicated - not in so many words that he was going to\r\n\r\nfix  the City Council! After all, one could indicate  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  things without words; otherwise animals  could\r\n\r\nnot  get  along with one another. Now, Sir, we  do  not\r\n\r\ncare.  By  all  means, \"Let's fix  the  City  Council.\"\r\n\r\nMagnificent! We have a first-class election  issue;  we\r\n\r\nwill  take a big stick to bang the Government  and  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. candidates with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  what  we want to avoid at all costs is  the  civil\r\n\r\ncommotion which may follow when the public feel  a  bit\r\n\r\nperplexed, frustrated and angry. My purpose in bringing\r\n\r\nit  out  today - the  purpose  of  my  Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee, after we have had a discussion on this  last\r\n\r\nnight - was  to tell the public that such a thing  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  air;  that if it happens, they should  forget  it,\r\n\r\nignore it, and let the City Council be closed down. But\r\n\r\nlet  there  be general elections within sixty  days  of\r\n\r\ndissolution.  Because  then we can  settle  the  parent\r\n\r\naccount. I am sorry the Deputy Chief Minister has  left\r\n\r\na big question mark in all our minds. We can appreciate\r\n\r\nhis anger; after all, much as I would deplore this sort\r\n\r\nof  pique -  he  walked  out of, I  believe,  a  special\r\n\r\nperformance given in honour of the Duke because he  was\r\n\r\nnot given a chair-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is personal\r\n\r\nconduct  outside the Assembly. The hon.  Member  cannot\r\n\r\nrefer to it at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Just because the Minutes were not\r\n\r\nsent  to  him  as  immediately as  he  thought  he  was\r\n\r\nentitled  to  have them, it does not mean that  he  can\r\n\r\njust scrap the City Council. By all means scrub it! But\r\n\r\nyou  have to justify it. And I will say this:  that  we\r\n\r\nknow  what is going on, otherwise we would not survive;\r\n\r\nwe  knew yesterday what was on the boil. There was  Mr\r\n\r\nMeadows  running  around; there was  the  Senior  Crown\r\n\r\nCounsel  hovering  in  the  background.  They  were  in\r\n\r\nconference. I also knew that Mr Carl Schubert,  Acting\r\n\r\nSecretary  and Legal Adviser to the City  Council, had\r\n\r\ngone  and  seen  a  D.P.P.,  who  confirmed  that   his\r\n\r\ninterpretation was the correct interpretation; that the\r\n\r\nCouncil,  and not the Mayor or the C.A.O., should  give\r\n\r\nthe  Minutes. But these are all technicalities. We knew\r\n\r\nsomething was brewing, and we wanted to nip it  in  the\r\n\r\nbud. And this is the reason why we say it is absolutely\r\n\r\ndangerous.  The brakes should be put on. If  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  allows the brakes to go off, then unwittingly\r\n\r\nhe would have embarked on a really hazardous adventure.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  brakes  are going to be put on or not.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthey  will. That somewhat emotional exhibition  of  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Chief Minister this morning probably has stifled\r\n\r\nany  hope,  if  he had any, of getting his  Ministerial\r\n\r\ncolleagues to agree to embark on this perilous journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But although we have stifled this one, there are\r\n\r\nstill two and a half months to go before polling day at\r\n\r\nthe  end of May. And then it could well be the  end  of\r\n\r\nJune  or the beginning of July. I do not know when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   intends  to  advise  the  Governor   about\r\n\r\ndissolving  this Assembly. But the Governor has  stated\r\n\r\nin  solemn  language that there will be polling  within\r\n\r\nsixty days of the date of dissolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we come to the crux of the point: if the\r\n\r\nBritish  are  prepared for international  repercussions\r\n\r\nand the long-term repercussions of snuffing out a Left-wing  democratic movement, then I would  say,  \"We  are\r\n\r\nfinished.  We  are out.\" We are prepared for  that.  In\r\n\r\nwhich  case,  I say those who come after us  should  be\r\n\r\nwell  advised  to join some other Party.  That  is  our\r\n\r\nposition. We are not interested in obtaining power  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake  of power. As I have explained,  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndifference of degree between the Members in front of me\r\n\r\nand  my colleagues, so great as to make it a difference\r\n\r\nof  kind. Every one of my colleagues, when he goes into\r\n\r\nthe  arena,  is  losing  something.  They,  unlike  the\r\n\r\ngentlemen  opposite,  know exactly  what  this  is  all\r\n\r\nabout. We saw Pandora's Box opened one by one till  the\r\n\r\nsmallest  and last box, and we are moving forward  into\r\n\r\nposition  to  take  over because  we  have  no  choice.\r\n\r\nBecause  it  is  the right thing to do by  our  people.\r\n\r\nBecause  if  we  do  not, a collection  of  scallawags,\r\n\r\nrogues and vagabonds might get in, and then that is the\r\n\r\nend of the democratic experiment, and all this nonsense\r\n\r\nof  holding  elections  will  never  happen.  Then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  British  are no  longer  responsible  for\r\n\r\ninternal security. Then we are all in the bag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the reason. Knowing full well what is in that\r\n\r\nBox,  knowing full well that we may never  be  able  to\r\n\r\nmount a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbigger  campaign at the end of five years  than  we  do\r\n\r\nnow, and fully aware of all the pitfalls, I suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore that we have a better chance of\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  making  the democratic  system  work  than\r\n\r\nanybody  else. Because we know the price of  making  it\r\n\r\nwork does not depend on just locking up people who work\r\n\r\nto  build up power, who work to build up popularity. If\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon had the opportunity  to  work\r\n\r\nwith  some of those who have been arrested and banished\r\n\r\nas  Communists,  he would know the dedication  and  the\r\n\r\ndrive that they put on the ground-and they worked  like\r\n\r\ndemons.  And if he wants to compete, I believe  he  may\r\n\r\nbecause  his  hands  are clean. He  is  a  simple  man,\r\n\r\nalthough at one time I was afraid Mr Chew Swee Kee was\r\n\r\ngoing  to subvert him. They went out of London together\r\n\r\nand departed to some secret destination. I thought that\r\n\r\nwas   the  end  of  him.  I  am  glad  he  has  emerged\r\n\r\nuntarnished.  But he could not put up a fight.  Because\r\n\r\nyou must have drive, and you must believe in it to have\r\n\r\ndrive.  And  this Government on going down believes  in\r\n\r\nnothing  but  survival, and for that reason  I  propose\r\n\r\nthat,  regardless of the voting on this Division,  they\r\n\r\nshould  seriously consider whether or not  they  should\r\n\r\nnot  put  themselves  in  an unassailable  position  by\r\n\r\ntaking  leave.  I say, if they want the money,  by  all\r\n\r\nmeans get their pay up to polling day on leave prior to\r\n\r\nretirement.  We all know it is retirement  anyway.  The\r\n\r\nTunku  has set an illustrious example. He says: \"I  can\r\n\r\nserve  the  people better working on the  ground.\"  The\r\n\r\nChief  Minister was so carried away as to  remark,  \"We\r\n\r\nwill  all be so busy with the elections that we  cannot\r\n\r\nuse  our  Ministerial positions to exercise influence.\"\r\n\r\nWell, if that is so, if that is the position honest  to\r\n\r\nGod,  then  what reason is there for remaining  in  the\r\n\r\nMinisterial chair? This is the last sitting.  We  would\r\n\r\nrather  have  left them alone because these  were  just\r\n\r\nlittle things. The Chief Minister has now more or  less\r\n\r\ndesisted. But only for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  time being. He keeps dithering on the brink.

I urge  him  even\r\n\r\nafter  we have departed from this Chamber to reconsider\r\n\r\nwhether he should not put himself beyond doubt and quit\r\n\r\nMinisterial office after Nomination Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my motion was couched in what I\r\n\r\nthought  was relatively restrained language. I did  not\r\n\r\nbother  to  justify the disgust at the loss  of  public\r\n\r\nconfidence, because I think that was too obvious. But I\r\n\r\ndo  ask them in their last few weeks of office, not  to\r\n\r\nbring   about  more  discredit.  If  they  only   bring\r\n\r\ndiscredit  to  themselves, it  does  not  matter,  but,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, their discredit may discredit the  whole\r\n\r\nsystem  and the institutions through which subsequently\r\n\r\nwe  will have to work.

If at times we had  been\r\n\r\ninclined to be trying or difficult, it was not prompted\r\n\r\nby  disrespect  but by emotion which, on  a  number  of\r\n\r\noccasions, some of us were quite unable to contain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It augurs well for the future of Singapore and our\r\n\r\nhopes for a truly democratic Government that under  the\r\n\r\nnew Constitution you, Sir, will also preside as Speaker\r\n\r\nwhen the new Assembly comes into being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like also, Sir, to place on record, on behalf\r\n\r\nof  all Members of this House, our sincere appreciation\r\n\r\nof  the services and assistance which the Clerk of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly and his staff accorded all Members\r\n\r\nduring this and previous sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nplace  on record the deep esteem we have felt  for  the\r\n\r\nway  in which you have conducted your high office.

In ruling these remarks out of order, may I  say\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  completely overwhelmed  by  the  kind  and\r\n\r\ngenerous  remarks of hon. Members? I can only say  that\r\n\r\nmy  task,  which has been exacting at times,  has  been\r\n\r\nmade   easier   by   the  goodwill,   cooperation   and\r\n\r\nunderstanding of hon.
