Other  points\r\n\r\npertain  to  the further stress that will  be  loaded  on\r\n\r\nteachers,   parents   and   students   because   of   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of new subjects as well as  the  danger  of\r\n\r\ncreating an elitist society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard through the debate, I am reminded of a\r\n\r\nSunday  school song that I used to sing and used to  feel\r\n\r\nvery troubled when singing it.  The lyrics of the song go\r\n\r\nthis way:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look all over the world,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one likes me,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look all over the world,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one exactly like me,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are short and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are tall,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But God loves them all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to feel very troubled singing these lyrics\r\n\r\nuntil one day, I ventured to ask my mother why is it that\r\n\r\n\"no one likes me\", and that was when my mother gave me  a\r\n\r\nlesson on the reality of the world that we are living in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me to put out my 10 fingers and to note\r\n\r\nthat  the  10 fingers are of different lengths  and  they\r\n\r\nalso  bear different  fingerprints.  However, each finger\r\n\r\nis  unique  in  itself and they are all precious  to  our\r\n\r\nCreator.   So, it was about being different and not about\r\n\r\nbeing liked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going by this illustration, at home, our siblings\r\n\r\ncan  be  very different from one another, yet we are  all\r\n\r\nloved  by our parents.  Extend that to the nation  state;\r\n\r\nthe  citizens are all different individuals, yet they are\r\n\r\nall  loved by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of what NMP Dr Jennifer Lee has\r\n\r\nmentioned  about  the 400,000 potential  workers  at  the\r\n\r\nbottom rung of the ladder.  In fact, I would say that 75-80%  of  the  student cohort will not  benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nrevised  recommendations for the Upper Secondary  Schools\r\n\r\nand the JCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotally, this is similar to putting nail polish\r\n\r\non  the  two middle fingernails.  When we hide  away  the\r\n\r\nother  eight  fingers, the fingers with nail polish  look\r\n\r\nvery  pretty.  However, when you put up the  other  eight\r\n\r\nfingers,  the  two middle fingers with nail  polish  that\r\n\r\nhappen  to  be the longer ones will stick out  like  sore\r\n\r\nfingers  amongst  the other eight fingers  with  no  nail\r\n\r\npolish.   This pair of hands will not look as  pretty  as\r\n\r\nanother pair of hands with nail polish on all the  finger\r\n\r\nnails.  So, the way to close the gap between the top  20-25%  and  the other 75% is really to level up  the  lower\r\n\r\ncohort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is where Dr Jennifer Lee's and\r\n\r\nthe  other MPs' point about the need to take care of  the\r\n\r\nother  75%  or  so of the student cohort begs  attention,\r\n\r\nlest  we  inadvertently cultivate students who feel  that\r\n\r\n\"no one likes me\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted the fact that resources are limited and that\r\n\r\nit is only natural that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresources are allocated to investments that give the best\r\n\r\npayoff, no one begrudges that we ought to concentrate our\r\n\r\nresources on the top 20- 25% of our student cohort.  This\r\n\r\nis  one way that we can ensure that our creme-de-la-creme\r\n\r\nare  nurtured to continue to lead our nation and  economy\r\n\r\ninto the future.  Nonetheless, it is necessary that there\r\n\r\nmust be some leftovers for the other 75% or so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted that the schools cannot afford to give equal\r\n\r\nresources  to  the  other 75% and  the  fact  that  going\r\n\r\nforward,  our  economy depends also on the input  of  the\r\n\r\nother 75%, how can MOE ensure that this 75% will be given\r\n\r\nthe opportunity for that life long learning?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out by my parliamentary colleague, Assoc.\r\n\r\nProf.  Koo  Tsai Kee, education is a life  long  journey.\r\n\r\nPreparing  our  students for the new society  requires  a\r\n\r\nlong-term plan where we will need to continually  educate\r\n\r\nknowledge  workers.   This is because knowledge  workers,\r\n\r\nunlike the traditional workers, no longer work with their\r\n\r\nhands,  and knowledge gets obsolete very rapidly  because\r\n\r\nit  is made irrelevant by advanced improvement in science\r\n\r\nand technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, what the Ministry is doing in terms of\r\n\r\nproviding the foundation and fundamental training for the\r\n\r\ngeneral  cohort of our students is correct.   However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to urge that the Ministry thinks beyond  the\r\n\r\nschools to ensure that the majority of the product of its\r\n\r\nsystem is given an opportunity to level itself up when it\r\n\r\nis  in  the real working world.  In this way, this  lower\r\n\r\ncohort   can  continue  to  contribute  to  the  economy,\r\n\r\nalthough they may not be at the helm of leadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I would like to compliment the Sub-Committee of the Economic Review Committee on Enhancing\r\n\r\nHuman  Capital.  The Sub-Committee has come up  with  two\r\n\r\nvery pertinent recommendations that I feel the MOE should\r\n\r\nmake a point to support, although I reckon that it is not\r\n\r\nin  the  charter of the MOE to bother itself  with  adult\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the directions and long-term plan of\r\n\r\nthe MOE to churn out\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknowledge workers of the economy cannot be formulated  in\r\n\r\nan  ivory  tower.  The determinants of MOE's  policy  are\r\n\r\nvery much grounded in the working world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two recommendations of the Sub-Committee of the\r\n\r\nERC  on  Enhancing Human Capital make important reference\r\n\r\nto  educating  and  nurturing our students  for  the  new\r\n\r\nsociety.   We are aware that the new society  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsociety populated by knowledge workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is unlike traditional skills, which change\r\n\r\nvery slowly.  To give an example, a museum near Barcelona\r\n\r\nin  Spain  contains a vast number of hand tools  used  by\r\n\r\nskilled  craftsmen  of the late Roman Empire,  which  any\r\n\r\ncraftsman  of  today would recognise immediately  because\r\n\r\nthey are very similar to the tools that are still in  use\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purpose of skill training, it is therefore\r\n\r\nreasonable to assume that whatever that has been  learned\r\n\r\nwhen  you  are  17 or 18 years of age would  last  for  a\r\n\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, knowledge becomes rapidly\r\n\r\nobsolete  and  knowledge workers have to  regularly  come\r\n\r\nback to school.  Continuing education of already educated\r\n\r\nadults will become a big growth area in the future.   The\r\n\r\ninformation  revolution  which already  has  an  enormous\r\n\r\nimpact  on  education  and  on  traditional  schools  and\r\n\r\nuniversities will probably have an even greater effect on\r\n\r\nthe continuing education of knowledge workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the recommendation on stimulating creativity\r\n\r\nand innovation by the ERC Sub-Committee.   I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our prime engines of growth will need to be fuelled\r\n\r\nby  capabilities that are indigenous, knowledge-based and\r\n\r\nservices-oriented  with  a  greater  emphasis  on   value\r\n\r\ncreation,  innovation and international orientation.   We\r\n\r\nneed our organisations to be places that consciously  and\r\n\r\nintentionally enable workers to be at their best and,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  build and expand their capabilities  to\r\n\r\nbecome more productive, more resilient, able to tap their\r\n\r\ncreativity   and   initiative,  and   bring   forth   new\r\n\r\ninnovation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can our schools partner the corporate world for\r\n\r\nthis bigger game plan?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHere,  I would like to recommend that our schools partner\r\n\r\nthe  corporate world to develop a virtual creativity  and\r\n\r\ninnovation  centre.   The  whole  idea  is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nstudents  to  upload their creative ideas  and  the  best\r\n\r\nideas could then be rewarded publicly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support perhaps could be given to the contributors\r\n\r\nof these ideas through adoption by an interested company,\r\n\r\nfor  example.   Such initiative can  go  a  long  way  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  the other 75% of our student cohort.  To nurture\r\n\r\na  bigger  cohort  of  students  for  more  creative  and\r\n\r\ninnovative    contribution,    the    environment     and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure must be all-encompassing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second recommendation of the ERC Sub-Committee\r\n\r\non   Enhancing  Human  Capital  is  on  transforming  the\r\n\r\neducation institutes into suppliers of knowledge workers.\r\n\r\nIt  was stated in the recommendation that \"we need to re-position schools and universities, so that in addition to\r\n\r\nteaching  and  educating,  they  serve  as  creators   of\r\n\r\nknowledge,   engines  of  innovation   and   cradles   of\r\n\r\nenterprise\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, schools can explore the possibility of\r\n\r\ntying  up with the corporate world to run a KBE-Readiness\r\n\r\nEnhancement  Project,  which the objective  would  be  to\r\n\r\nensure   that  education  institutes  supply  operational\r\n\r\nknowledge workers to the corporate world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a project, representatives of education\r\n\r\ninstitutes  and  representatives of the  corporate  world\r\n\r\ncould  meet,  to assess which key knowledge,  skills  and\r\n\r\ntraits  the business organisations most urgently  require\r\n\r\nof   their  employees  but  feel  are  not  yet  properly\r\n\r\nencouraged/developed by the education sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties can then identify how the corporate\r\n\r\nworld  can most efficiently help the education sector  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping these knowledge, skills and traits, and  which\r\n\r\nthird  party may help with this project.  Such  help  can\r\n\r\nactually  be  done  through lectures, provision  of  case\r\n\r\nstudies  and other materials, internships, exchanges  and\r\n\r\ninterviews.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the suggestions outlined so far attempt to\r\n\r\nclose a gap between the top 25% and the other 75% of  the\r\n\r\nstudent cohort, which if left unattended, will only widen\r\n\r\nthe divide.  All that MOE needs to do to make this happen\r\n\r\nis  to  take a more flexible approach in extending itself\r\n\r\nbeyond the schools and link up with the resources in  the\r\n\r\ncorporate world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the good and timely work put in by\r\n\r\nthe  Committee,  I  would like to  highlight  four  other\r\n\r\nissues for review by MOE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area of concern which MPs have talked\r\n\r\nabout  pertains to having enough supply of teachers.   My\r\n\r\nparliamentary   colleague,  Mr  Chew  Heng   Ching,   has\r\n\r\nsuggested  that we should look to taking in more  foreign\r\n\r\nteachers.   I would propose that we also should  look  to\r\n\r\nthe  pool of retrenched executives who would be  able  to\r\n\r\ntake  on  a  second  career  as  teachers  because  their\r\n\r\ncommercial  and real life experiences will  put  them  in\r\n\r\ngood   stead   as   non-academic  character   development\r\n\r\nprogramme specialists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education, RAdm Teo Chee Hean, has\r\n\r\nstated  in  his  speech  at  the  Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nInvestiture  of the 2001 National Day Awards  in  January\r\n\r\n2002  that one of the key challenges for the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation in the years ahead is to continue to build high\r\n\r\nquality teachers.  He had acknowledged that good teachers\r\n\r\nare  the  foundation  of  a good education  system.   The\r\n\r\nchallenge, he said, was to ensure that we maintain a high\r\n\r\nstandard  of teaching profession even as the  profile  of\r\n\r\nthe teaching force changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 3,500 of our experienced teachers will be\r\n\r\nretiring over the next five years.  This lot needs to  be\r\n\r\nreplaced.  With the revised syllabus, we know that  there\r\n\r\nis an additional load on existing teachers and we need to\r\n\r\nbeef up the pool.   Besides, MOE also has to recruit more\r\n\r\nteachers  in preparation for the larger student enrolment\r\n\r\nat  the secondary and junior college levels over the next\r\n\r\nfew  years.  Student enrolment at this level is projected\r\n\r\nto  increase by 25,000 from 220,000 today to  245,000  in\r\n\r\nyear 2006.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry was expected to recruit 3,000 new\r\n\r\nteachers  for  the  recruitment cycle  which  started  in\r\n\r\nAugust last year to July this year.  This recruitment was\r\n\r\nsupposed  to replace those who are retiring and  also  to\r\n\r\nset  up  recruitment in advance for secondary school  and\r\n\r\njunior college teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder to what extent the Ministry has met its\r\n\r\ntarget.   We  are aware that, apart from the  traditional\r\n\r\nsource  of fresh graduates joining the teaching  service,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  has also been recruiting those  with  some\r\n\r\nworking experience as teachers.  This is very encouraging\r\n\r\nand  opens a window of opportunity and hope for the  many\r\n\r\nretrenched executives today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that the Ministry consider a conversion\r\n\r\nprogramme that will put the professionals, executives and\r\n\r\nmanagers  who have been retrenched through a non-academic\r\n\r\nteaching diploma course within this 3-year window  before\r\n\r\n2006.  This group of retrenched executives constitutes  a\r\n\r\nfairly  high  percentage of the retrenched  employees  of\r\n\r\n100,000 in Singapore today.  They can be converted to  be\r\n\r\neconomically active and gainfully employed again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may lament that the issue really is that we can\r\n\r\nhave such a scheme but there would be no takers.  Well, I\r\n\r\nreckon  that in this aspect, we need to champion for  the\r\n\r\nfruition  of  such a scheme and even launch campaigns  to\r\n\r\nbring about awareness of a second career in teaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, perhaps the MOE could partner the National\r\n\r\nJob  Task  Force  and other agencies  such  as  SPEC,  to\r\n\r\nidentify   suitable  candidates,  design  the  conversion\r\n\r\nprogramme  for  character  development  and  deliver  the\r\n\r\nprogramme.   Such  effort and new  opportunities  in  the\r\n\r\neducation  industry will give a boost to these retrenched\r\n\r\nexecutives  who  will be able to find hope  in  a  second\r\n\r\ncareer in this industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of concern has to do with the\r\n\r\nbroader  range  of subjects that students are  now  faced\r\n\r\nwith and would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  to make a choice.  Independent counsellors  may  be\r\n\r\nneeded  because of the much wider choices to be  made  by\r\n\r\nstudents in the Integrated Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students have had little experience of free and\r\n\r\nwide  choice.  So far, they have been channelled  through\r\n\r\nthe whole education system almost totally on the basis of\r\n\r\ntheir  various  scores.  They and their parents  are  not\r\n\r\nready  for  freedom  of  choice to  this  extent.   These\r\n\r\nindependent  counsellors could be  trained  up  from  the\r\n\r\nranks   and   file   of  the  retrenched   professionals,\r\n\r\nexecutives and managers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third area of review, I would advocate that\r\n\r\nwe  integrate  project work into the  real  life  working\r\n\r\nenvironment.   As  project work gives an opportunity  for\r\n\r\nnurturing  EQ  and  character  development,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nleadership,  we  ought to think in  terms  of  internship\r\n\r\nduring school vacation for students in the working world.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  arrangement  should  be  made  to   encourage\r\n\r\nemployers,  as good corporate citizens, to  help  nurture\r\n\r\nthe   future   manpower  of  Singapore  by   being   more\r\n\r\nforthcoming in their internship programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, experience has shown that if there is no\r\n\r\nproper  monitoring of this type of programme, very  often\r\n\r\nthese   interns  end  up  as  mere  hands  and  legs   in\r\n\r\norganisations.  This is really a waste because  it  would\r\n\r\nnot  provide  these students with the necessary  learning\r\n\r\nthat they are looking for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, it would be good for MOE to think\r\n\r\nin  terms  of how they can work out a suitable  programme\r\n\r\nwith  employers  to  enhance  some  of  these  internship\r\n\r\nprogrammes for project work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth issue I would like to raise is that the\r\n\r\nReview  Committee's  proposal is not  clear  as  to  what\r\n\r\npercentage  of  the  learning will be  on  nurturing  the\r\n\r\nstudent in the EQ and character development aspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of EQ, besides the innate characteristic\r\n\r\nof an individual, I believe a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncertain  amount  of nurturing and exposure  can  actually\r\n\r\ncreate   awareness  in  an  individual  to  realise   and\r\n\r\nunderstand the importance of developing strengths in this\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal has recommended that one way to do it\r\n\r\nis  to  allow  the nurturing of these characteristics  to\r\n\r\nreside in the non-academic area.  It would appear  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  a  paradoxical situation could arise  for  a  young\r\n\r\nteenager  in  the  JC because he would  be  torn  between\r\n\r\nfocusing his energy in the academic pursuits rather  than\r\n\r\nstriking   a  balance  simply  because  the  non-academic\r\n\r\npursuits  may not be given equal weightage  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fine provided that there is a campaign to\r\n\r\ncreate  understanding and awareness amongst our teachers,\r\n\r\nparents  and  students, that though not as measurable  as\r\n\r\nthe academic pursuits, the non-academic pursuits will  be\r\n\r\nrecorded as track record and experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due recognition for such pursuits should include\r\n\r\nappropriate and meaningful proportionate weightage in the\r\n\r\nadmission  into  university programmes  as  well  as  for\r\n\r\nappointments  in  their  careers.   It  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nestablish a quantitative measure of non-academic  or  co-curricular work in order to incentivise pursuit  of  such\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the top universities like Yale, Harvard\r\n\r\nand   the  other  Ivy  League  universities  place  great\r\n\r\nemphasis  on students' co-curricular activities in  their\r\n\r\nadmission  criteria.   Of course, the  applicant  has  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  the basic requirements but it is common knowledge\r\n\r\nthat the student's non-academic activities have important\r\n\r\nweightage.    In  our  case,  the  university   admission\r\n\r\ncriterion states a bonus 5% on CCA, which for all the big\r\n\r\nbang  on  promoting  non-academic  pursuits  as  in   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations, would be insignificantly effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with project work which encompasses a big\r\n\r\nchunk  of  EQ quality and integrating skills,  would  MOE\r\n\r\nconsider increasing this aspect of learning and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  ie,  CCA and project work  to  15%  of  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission criterion?  This  is  approximately\r\n\r\nequivalent  to the credits earned in one subject.   Since\r\n\r\nmuch  time  is spent on such pursuits, we ought  to  give\r\n\r\nsome   credit  here  and  not  because  many  Singaporean\r\n\r\nstudents  adopt  the attitude of \"if you give  me  points\r\n\r\nthen I'll do it\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we know that in truth, there may be little sport\r\n\r\ndone  by these students for pure enjoyment.  CCA  is  not\r\n\r\nimparting  mental strength in many of our  students.   It\r\n\r\ndoes impart a scoring mentality.  This happens because we\r\n\r\nhave  yet  to  be able to deliver a system,  which  would\r\n\r\nmotivate students to pursue purely for the love of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating for a materialistic approach but\r\n\r\nbeing   practical  about  things,  in  my  opinion,   the\r\n\r\nidealistic philosophy of \"I do it for the love of it\" has\r\n\r\ngot  to be cultivated.  It takes time to do that, and  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest of time, let us begin by buying in as  many\r\n\r\nas  possible,  with an approach that can win  big  scores\r\n\r\namong Singaporeans.  Once we have achieved a culture  for\r\n\r\nthe   non-academic  pursuits,  we  can  then  throw  away\r\n\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, co-curricular activities of a person are\r\n\r\ngiven high weightings by multinationals corporations such\r\n\r\nas  Shell, Exxon-Mobil and Mars Chocolates.  They have  a\r\n\r\nvalue-add   contribution  in  determining  the   holistic\r\n\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I ask what should any system of\r\n\r\neducation set out to achieve?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a recent study conducted by Towers\r\n\r\nPerrin,  the  attributes most sought after today  include\r\n\r\ncreativity, the ability to learn, versatility,  awareness\r\n\r\nof  the  business  environment and the ability  to  think\r\n\r\nbeyond   functional   and  cultural  boundaries.    These\r\n\r\nattributes  encompass a combination of knowledge,  skills\r\n\r\nand  mindsets  or  attitude.   In  a  sense  this  model,\r\n\r\nattitude, skills and knowledge, the ASK model,  gives  us\r\n\r\nsomething  to  start with but we need to think  carefully\r\n\r\nabout how we go about to achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying philosophy of any competence-based\r\n\r\ninitiative is based on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  perceived  need to help individuals  respond  to  an\r\n\r\nenvironment, which is becoming increasingly  diverse  and\r\n\r\nunpredictable.  The revised JC and upper secondary course\r\n\r\nsyllabus  should  incorporate a  competence  approach  to\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and learning to learn for all and  not  just\r\n\r\nthe top 25%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should be looking at is a broader definition\r\n\r\nof learning - one that is process orientated, integrated,\r\n\r\nholistic  and ongoing for all.  And that also takes  into\r\n\r\naccount  the wider environment, as well as the  learner's\r\n\r\npersonality  traits.  I believe that the  recommendations\r\n\r\nof  the  Review Committee would ultimately drive  towards\r\n\r\nthese objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry or the Committee to be\r\n\r\nresponsive  to suggestions for improvements made  and  to\r\n\r\ninitiate  a  whole  new discussion on the  implementation\r\n\r\nfollow up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I would like to support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank\r\n\r\nyou, Speaker, Sir, for letting me join in the debate.   I\r\n\r\nrise  in  support of the motion and also to raise  a  few\r\n\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the Education Review Committee's report on\r\n\r\nthe Upper Secondary/Junior College curriculum well-placed\r\n\r\nin  wanting  to give students a breadth in  knowledge  as\r\n\r\nwell as depth in subjects that they hold dear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly excited by the subject 'Knowledge\r\n\r\nand  Inquiry', seeing it as an opportunity  to  introduce\r\n\r\nmodules,  such  as  certain  aspects  of  university  101\r\n\r\ncourses,   such  as  anthropology,  sociology,   cultural\r\n\r\nstudies,  management skills, or perhaps  best  practices,\r\n\r\nand mass communication skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am keen on this widening of the curriculum as long\r\n\r\nas  long  as  it  holds  true to what  I  see  as  a  key\r\n\r\noperational  phrase in the report - giving  students  the\r\n\r\n\"space  to pursue\".  I think it is pivotal that  we  give\r\n\r\nthem the space and the time to learn, to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nredefine, to review, and the whole process repeats itself\r\n\r\nagain.   That is part of the initiative to which I  think\r\n\r\nindividuals can pick up those skills to become  confident\r\n\r\nin  coming up with new ideas.  On a larger scale,  I  see\r\n\r\nthis  initiative as something that is very  important  to\r\n\r\nour  society  because it is giving a  clear  signal  that\r\n\r\nperhaps from maybe 2006, or from now on, we are placing a\r\n\r\nlarger emphasis on the value of learning, the process  of\r\n\r\nlearning,  rather than just the facts.  So I commend  and\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the Committee for coming  up  with  such  a\r\n\r\nproposal.   It is going to take some time for  people  to\r\n\r\nshift their gears into understanding what it all means at\r\n\r\nthe ground level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the concerns, primarily, I would have\r\n\r\nbeen most comforted if the report had also engaged itself\r\n\r\non  the ranking scheme, the university admission criteria\r\n\r\nand the appraisal scheme for teachers.  These have to  be\r\n\r\nin  tandem  and  aligned with the outcomes  of  this  new\r\n\r\nreview  where  the curriculum is concerned.   If  we  are\r\n\r\nexpecting  our  students to perform  according  to  these\r\n\r\nindicators,  whatever the outcomes be, then  likewise  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  following  that  through  with  an  appraisal\r\n\r\nscheme,  whether it is appraised in schools,  whether  it\r\n\r\nmeans  admitting students into university  or  appraising\r\n\r\nteachers in tandem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just go back to an old issue that has come up\r\n\r\nin  Parliament many, many times, in the media and,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  in  many  feedback sessions -  the  great  ranking\r\n\r\nscheme.   It  has  always been based on  pure  academics,\r\n\r\nwhether it is the value-added side, or whether it is just\r\n\r\nthe  schools  or  JCs, they are ranked according  to  the\r\n\r\nacademic achievements of the students.  Perhaps this  has\r\n\r\nled to, at the ground level, a lot of us sacrificing what\r\n\r\nis the learning process and going just for the score.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give an example. As a former teacher\r\n\r\ntrying  to  persuade students or coming to that  kind  of\r\n\r\nconflict, whether I should persuade a student to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndrop  Literature  because the grades are  not  there,  or\r\n\r\nwhether I should let the student continue, it is a  tough\r\n\r\nscheme  to  be  up  against  the  system  that  does  not\r\n\r\nencourage the breadth that we are right now seeking  when\r\n\r\nwe  are interested only in the scores.  So I am heartened\r\n\r\nby  this  recommendation.  But I also  wish  the  ranking\r\n\r\nscheme can be reviewed as part of that recommendation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to see, and this has been\r\n\r\nsuggested  before,  is the schools  and  junior  colleges\r\n\r\nlisted in alphabetical order with perhaps five stars  for\r\n\r\nparticular   strengths,  be  they  in   Sciences,   Moral\r\n\r\nEducation  or  whatever, and three stars  for  internship\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   Such a resource library of information  for\r\n\r\nparents  to choose and for students to choose  what  they\r\n\r\nwould  like to pursue will be a clear signal that we  are\r\n\r\ngiving to society as to what we are putting emphasis on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another side effect of the ranking scheme, at\r\n\r\npresent,  is  that a lot of polytechnic students  end  up\r\n\r\nhaving remedial classes in additional Mathematics because\r\n\r\nthey  have  been encouraged to drop it,  or  it  was  not\r\n\r\noffered.   So the breadth is important if we want  things\r\n\r\nto happen according to this Review Committee's proposals.\r\n\r\nAnd  ranking, in my opinion, is a stumbling block and can\r\n\r\nalso  subvert what the Ministry is trying to do.   So  it\r\n\r\nbecomes quite ironical.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, university admission criteria. Changes are\r\n\r\nalready  happening and it is heartening.   However,  like\r\n\r\nMdm  Ho Geok Choo, I too wonder whether the project  work\r\n\r\ncould  have  a  higher  weightage,  and  the  'A'  levels\r\n\r\nthemselves, instead of 75%, should come down a bit lower.\r\n\r\nThe  interviews at universities should play an  important\r\n\r\nrole so that we can assess whether the student is capable\r\n\r\nof whatever the outcome that we are trying to measure the\r\n\r\nstudent for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, teachers' appraisals. It is common knowledge\r\n\r\nthat  teachers are appraised on the kind of results  that\r\n\r\nthey  bring back where their students are concerned.   It\r\n\r\nis  quite  a  major criterion, talking  to  teachers  and\r\n\r\nprincipals.  They do tell you that it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplays  a  part and, in some cases, a big part.  Appraisal\r\n\r\nof  teachers  is then linked to performance  bonuses  and\r\n\r\nteachers themselves are drawn into this scheme.  If we do\r\n\r\nnot  change the appraisal scheme, making it perhaps  even\r\n\r\nan  open appraisal scheme whereby teachers and principals\r\n\r\nnegotiate  what  they mean by teaching a  student  to  be\r\n\r\ncreative,  what  they mean by teaching a  student  to  be\r\n\r\ncritical, these are intangibles in a lot of ways, how are\r\n\r\nwe  going to measure that and give due credit to teachers\r\n\r\nso  that they do not get demoralised for the efforts that\r\n\r\nthey  put  in but can continue and buy in into what  this\r\n\r\nrecommendation is all about?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, for this aspect of what I am talking\r\n\r\nabout,  I  feel that I would have been most comforted  if\r\n\r\nthere is an assurance that these three areas are going to\r\n\r\nbe  in  sync, in tandem or aligned with what this  report\r\n\r\nsets out to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the others, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Iswaran and Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer Lee, I too feel that, while tackling the top,  I\r\n\r\nhave  got  no quarrels with making the system better  for\r\n\r\nthe  top  25%.   I feel that it is equally  important  to\r\n\r\nhandle the lower primary.  I wish that, in the same  nine\r\n\r\nmonths, this same Committee, or another, could look  into\r\n\r\nreviewing the curriculum, etc, for pupils from Primary  1\r\n\r\nto  Primary 3.  They are the years that really  give  the\r\n\r\nchild   the  fundamentals  in  language  skills  and   in\r\n\r\nArithmetic.   There  are  good programmes  like  LSP  and\r\n\r\nENABLE.   But still, where language skills are concerned,\r\n\r\nfor  the  demands that are coming up, can  we  equip  our\r\n\r\nchildren  well enough?  So this has to be in tandem  too,\r\n\r\nthat we try and fix the lower primary classes as well  as\r\n\r\nthe  upper end.  So I am hoping that that too is  on  the\r\n\r\ncards and will surface perhaps quite soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Minister of State, Dr Ng Eng Hen, and\r\n\r\nalso Minister Teo Chee Hean, on how we have come very far\r\n\r\nand  how we have helped our students to come along.   90%\r\n\r\nis a good, big average that we have looked after, as what\r\n\r\nwas  said,  and that a lot of our students now  are  well\r\n\r\nequipped to converse in English.  This is laudable.  I do\r\n\r\nfeel that while it is a good place to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narrive at when we are in a global world with demands that\r\n\r\nare  becoming  greater, we also have  to  relook  at  the\r\n\r\nquality and think about, besides the numbers appearing at\r\n\r\n'O'  levels  and the numbers who are passing through  the\r\n\r\nlanguage courses, the quality of our students.  One trend\r\n\r\nthat  I  personally  find disturbing  is  the  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents  who  are  now ending in the  Normal  (Academic)\r\n\r\nstream, not to say that that is a wrong stream.  But when\r\n\r\nwe  first started with small numbers, I think, today,  it\r\n\r\nis  three  out of every eight students.  And it begs  the\r\n\r\nquestion that, while we review and do better for the top,\r\n\r\noffering choices, etc, should we not go further back  and\r\n\r\ntry  and  see  what  are  the  trends  where  quality  is\r\n\r\nconcerned?   So  I am hoping that the review  will  cover\r\n\r\nthat  because, like what was said before, fixing the  top\r\n\r\nis  well  and good and needs to be done.  But  the  group\r\n\r\nthat  is  feeding  the top too needs to be  given  better\r\n\r\nvitamins, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this whole issue on the importance of the mother\r\n\r\ntongue, again, back at JC curriculum level, a lot of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  have  become, through 10  years  of  education,\r\n\r\nquite  well  emplaced in their proficiency  where  mother\r\n\r\ntongue is concerned.  May I suggest that perhaps it is  a\r\n\r\nbetter idea that we offer a second language, with not the\r\n\r\nhigh  rigours  of a mother tongue at the JC  level,  that\r\n\r\nmakes  them  become  a  global  citizen,  whether  it  be\r\n\r\nsomething for the region, or something across,  and  that\r\n\r\nshould  give them more language-based skills as  well  as\r\n\r\nnot  to  overload  them with the mother tongue  emphasis.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the university admission criteria will have  to\r\n\r\nbe readjusted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Centralised Institutes. There are 1,063\r\n\r\nstudents  who  attend the Centralised  Institutes.   They\r\n\r\nhave  a  good record of being able to send quite a number\r\n\r\nof  their students to university.  My fear here is, under\r\n\r\nthe present 2006 curriculum that is supposed to come, can\r\n\r\nour  students from these Centralised Institutes cope with\r\n\r\nsuch high demands?  It might be a better idea to take the\r\n\r\nlower  end of the junior college intake, perhaps  the  19\r\n\r\npointers and the 20 pointers, fill them with the students\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Centralised Institutes and put  them  under  a\r\n\r\ncollege\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprogramme whereby these efforts are intensified, and they\r\n\r\nhave a better chance of surviving the 'A' levels which we\r\n\r\nall  know is going to get a bit more stressful, and  make\r\n\r\nit  to  university.  Because, by 2006, in my opinion,  it\r\n\r\ncan be quite out of sync for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few concerns where implementation is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  One of them is the revised curriculum that is\r\n\r\nto  be written.  I have some questions.  Who would be the\r\n\r\nplanners?   What  is  their expertise?   What  are  their\r\n\r\nspecialist  areas?  And what kind of  training?   On  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of teachers, much has been said - Dr  Amy  Khor\r\n\r\nhas  spoken on it and I am echoing that - quite a  number\r\n\r\nof  the teacher trainees, who now go through the National\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Education,  are  students  who  have  come\r\n\r\nthrough  this programme of being quite examination-smart.\r\n\r\nHow  are  we going to retrain them within the  next  four\r\n\r\nyears  such  that  we can open up their  minds  to  start\r\n\r\nthinking more creatively and critically?  Could  we  have\r\n\r\nsome assurance on both the numbers as well as the quality\r\n\r\nwhere teacher training is concerned?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue of the teachers and students, those\r\n\r\nwho are already in the classrooms right now, how are they\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  trained  where  the  training  hours   are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  because we have just got our first  group  of\r\n\r\n'A'  level  students who are sitting for their 'A'  level\r\n\r\nexamination under the revised syllabus?  And the teachers\r\n\r\nhave  just  adjusted  to  the  revised  syllabus.   I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  who is monitoring  this  and  how  will\r\n\r\nteachers  cope  with  trying  to  vacillate  between  two\r\n\r\nsystems,  the  revised syllabus for  the  'A'  levels  at\r\n\r\npresent as well as the 2006 curriculum that is coming.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to hear some kind of a plan or programme  in\r\n\r\nthis aspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wonderful to have specialised tools to cater\r\n\r\nto  students who want to excel in sports, the arts,  etc.\r\n\r\nBut  I also wonder, if by this proposal, we are very keen\r\n\r\nin opening the window and letting students come up with a\r\n\r\npath  that  suits them best, why are we not  opening  the\r\n\r\nsports school\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  students  from the Normal (Academic)  stream  or  the\r\n\r\nNormal (Technical) stream?  Such students will learn much\r\n\r\nfrom  the  discipline  of sports to  excel  also  in  the\r\n\r\nacademic  curriculum with much help from such  a  school.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is a little bit beyond me to understand.  On  one\r\n\r\nhand,  in  summary, there is this proposal, a  very  good\r\n\r\nexciting  one, and yet there are these few things  around\r\n\r\nthis  proposal that can run the risk of subverting  these\r\n\r\ngood intentions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, such a proposal, to be successful - and I\r\n\r\npersonally  hope  that it will succeed -  cannot  act  in\r\n\r\nisolation.   Society too needs to embrace this  proposal,\r\n\r\nunderstand  what  it  means for  them  as  individuals  - parents,   students  or  teachers  -   and,   with   that\r\n\r\nunderstanding, force themselves not to be over-eager, not\r\n\r\nto  be so kiasu, as we normally call it, and to give this\r\n\r\na chance to breathe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I would say that sometimes our obsession\r\n\r\nwith  saving face and not wanting to make mistakes, as  a\r\n\r\ncultural  norm  too, can thwart the progress  of  such  a\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, this motion to\r\n\r\ndebate on the White Paper on education in the name of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education, RAdm Teo Chee Hean,  has  caused\r\n\r\ntwo  different  reactions.  On one level,  that  includes\r\n\r\nmost,  if  not  all  of  us  in this  House,  the  stated\r\n\r\nintentions of the recommendations of the education  White\r\n\r\nPaper are so positively constructed that no one can  find\r\n\r\nfault  with.   On the other level, some Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nsome  of our foreign friends overseas are befuddled  with\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper.   They wonder  is  it  that  when  our\r\n\r\nstudents   keep   coming   out  tops   at   international\r\n\r\nmathematics and science tests, we are still not satisfied\r\n\r\nand have to try and change it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I initially had some thoughts along these lines\r\n\r\ntoo.   I  had  the  benefit of a local  education  in  my\r\n\r\nformative  years and a good overseas tertiary  education.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned from the US in 1988, I compared and found\r\n\r\nour local curriculum too stacked up in terms of knowledge\r\n\r\nacquisition.  My colleagues, who were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlocal   graduates,  were  extremely  competent   in   the\r\n\r\ntechnical  aspects of their work and found it interesting\r\n\r\nwhen   I   shared   with  them  the   US   system   where\r\n\r\nundergraduates must take courses other than classes  that\r\n\r\nare  required to satisfy the major that they are  taking.\r\n\r\nSuch   classes   include   Holistic   Medicine,   Speech,\r\n\r\nCommunication and Rhetoric.  I was also required to  take\r\n\r\ncourses  for  both  an  Arts and  Science  cluster  as  a\r\n\r\nBusiness undergraduate.  Without the completion  of  such\r\n\r\nuniversity  requirements  of  the  clusters,  a  Business\r\n\r\nundergraduate may not even get a degree, if the  Business\r\n\r\nclasses  are  completed.  The Arts  cluster  may  include\r\n\r\nsubjects like Social Psychology, German Language, Russian\r\n\r\nLiterature,  or Geography.  Examples of Science  clusters\r\n\r\ninclude  Physics  of Light, Astronomy or Fluid  Dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis   gives  students  a  broader  knowledge  base  and,\r\n\r\ncertainly,   some  competence  in  participating   in   a\r\n\r\ndiscourse that is outside their major field of study.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a nagging thought that something needed fixing\r\n\r\nthen,  and  again thought to myself, our system  had  met\r\n\r\nSingapore's national needs for the longest time.  So,  if\r\n\r\nit  ain't  broke, don't fix it or, rather,  if  it  isn't\r\n\r\nbroken,  leave  it, to emphasise support  of  RAdm  Teo's\r\n\r\npoint  that we do have a good standard of English.  Also,\r\n\r\nit  was a system that let me stay well above others at  a\r\n\r\ngood university in the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, then to now, a lot of water had gone under\r\n\r\nthe  bridge, to borrow the often-used phrase, \"the  world\r\n\r\nhas  changed\".  We are indeed in a very different  world.\r\n\r\nEducation reform has now become a global trend and is now\r\n\r\ndiscussed   and   has   taken   centre-stage   at    many\r\n\r\ninternational conferences.  Part of the reason  for  this\r\n\r\nis  the  rapid and drastic socio-economic change that  is\r\n\r\ntaking  place on a global scale.  In an era of  increased\r\n\r\neconomic  competition, it is critical to have  a  trained\r\n\r\nand  qualified workforce to support, sustain and  advance\r\n\r\nthe  scientific, technological and economic  capabilities\r\n\r\nof our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education reform, as an integral part of a nation's\r\n\r\nstrategic policy, is not something new.  The US  and  the\r\n\r\nUK have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npromoted improving the quality of education as a means to\r\n\r\nstrengthen international competitiveness since the 1980s.\r\n\r\nFrance   has  integrated  educational  reform  into   its\r\n\r\npolicies  for the development of the country.  China  has\r\n\r\nbeen using the slogan \"Invigorating China through Science\r\n\r\nand  Education\".  In Japan, two years ago the  government\r\n\r\nhas pledged to make educational reform the foundation  of\r\n\r\nall social systems in this century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these countries, which are richer and better\r\n\r\nendowed in terms of natural resources than us, are giving\r\n\r\nsuch  a  high  priority to educational  reforms,  we  too\r\n\r\nshould look at how else we can build upon and improve our\r\n\r\nsystem.   We  cannot  stand still.   In  resource-limited\r\n\r\nSingapore, we not only cannot afford to stand still,  but\r\n\r\nwe  need  to run doubly fast.  I mentioned in one  of  my\r\n\r\nspeeches during the Budget debate earlier this year  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  like  an  airplane  navigating   in   very\r\n\r\nturbulent and difficult airspace.  I said that we  needed\r\n\r\nto  snap on new engines that will take us through.  To do\r\n\r\nthat, we need to look at our education system so that  we\r\n\r\nhave the innovative ability to conceptualise to make  the\r\n\r\ntools that will help us build that kind of engine to take\r\n\r\nus through for years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the importance of education and\r\n\r\neducational  reforms enjoys very high level support.   In\r\n\r\nfact, almost every US President in the last 20 years  had\r\n\r\nput   their   mark   on   improving   education   through\r\n\r\nlegislation.  We are no different in Singapore.  In 1997,\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  \"Thinking Schools,  Learning  Nation\"  was\r\n\r\nintroduced.  In this regard, we have appended much of our\r\n\r\nresources  to  the PRIME initiative.  From the  completed\r\n\r\nPRIME  schools that I have visited, I must say,  even  at\r\n\r\nthis  middle  stage  of  the programme,  it  is  a  great\r\n\r\nsuccess.   Similarly, a lot of effort and  resources  had\r\n\r\nbeen   put  into  getting  honest  and  useful  feedback,\r\n\r\npractical  suggestions and to lay down these  suggestions\r\n\r\nand  recommendations in the form of the  White  Paper  on\r\n\r\neducation.   This  will certainly  be  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant blueprints in the remaking of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that having a good education is an\r\n\r\nimportant  factor, not the only, but certainly  a  strong\r\n\r\ncontributor  towards economic success in life.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  true  in  a meritocratic and  academic-driven\r\n\r\nSingapore.   If you have good academic results,  you  are\r\n\r\nalmost certain of a good employment which, in turn, would\r\n\r\nprovide a good and comfortable life.  Thus, having a good\r\n\r\nemployment  is  a  motivating  factor  for  almost  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean in their academic pursuit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the area of employment, the civil service\r\n\r\nsends  the signal on what is important.  In most  of  the\r\n\r\nsenior positions in our civil service, the minimum  entry\r\n\r\nrequirement is at least an Honours (Second Upper).    For\r\n\r\na  student in Singapore, studying hard and aspiring to be\r\n\r\namply compensated, his or her work is cut out for him  or\r\n\r\nher,  and the route to be taken clearly marked out.  They\r\n\r\nwill   be  singled-minded  and  study  to  sit  for   the\r\n\r\nexamination subjects that will count towards entering the\r\n\r\nuniversity, never mind that the intent of the White Paper\r\n\r\non education calls for a thinking person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many fields, compensation does drive\r\n\r\nbehaviour.   Am I going to spend much time in  other  co-curricular  activities, such as sports or music?   Maybe.\r\n\r\nAnd  only  if I have some spare time left after  studying\r\n\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the most important determinants that\r\n\r\ndrives   students'   performance   must   be   university\r\n\r\nadmission.   Since  the  White Paper  leaves  it  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity/campus to decide on the weighting to be  given\r\n\r\nto  co-curricular activities and, at the same time, calls\r\n\r\nfor  a  downgrading to a 15% SAT, the university/campuses\r\n\r\nmust  review  their  admission criteria  too.   It  would\r\n\r\nappear  that when the recommendations of the White  Paper\r\n\r\ncome into play, the admission criteria would be outdated.\r\n\r\nUniversity admission criteria will have to be redrawn, in\r\n\r\nline  with  the  proposed changes  in  the  White  Paper.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, there will be another debate then.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation to allow for private schools is a\r\n\r\nstep  in  the right direction.  In the area of  knowledge\r\n\r\nacquisition and the quest for wisdom, no one can claim to\r\n\r\nhave  the right of monopolistic hold on it, not the least\r\n\r\nthe Government.  It does not do any good to have only one\r\n\r\nsystem  of  education  in a country.   The  existence  of\r\n\r\nprivate schools would spur greater performance all round.\r\n\r\nIn  the  US, on a standardised achievement test, ie,  the\r\n\r\nNational  Assessment  of  Educational  Progress,  private\r\n\r\nschool  students  generally  perform  higher  than  their\r\n\r\npublic  school  counterparts.  We already  have  a  high-quality  public  school system.  Certainly,  the  private\r\n\r\nschools  will also add to setting new benchmarks that  we\r\n\r\nmay  at  some stage consider for yet another White Paper.\r\n\r\nI  would  urge  then for the Ministry to  govern  private\r\n\r\nschools with a light hand and to let the market find  its\r\n\r\nown level in terms of operations, pricing and curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe private schools will then play a value-added role  in\r\n\r\npromoting Singapore as an education hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper calls for a reduction in the\r\n\r\nteaching hours for the students to be reduced by 10%, but\r\n\r\nwith  an  increase in the intensity of the curriculum  of\r\n\r\n25%.  I understand that the teaching staff in the schools\r\n\r\nthat  applied  for IP is ready to take on the  prescribed\r\n\r\nload.   This is not surprising, considering those schools\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the Raffles cluster and ACS(I) had  been  doing\r\n\r\ntheir  IP-similar programmes for some years.  My fear  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  readiness of the teachers -  whom  some  of  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleagues have talked about over the  last\r\n\r\ntwo  days  - whether those who are expected to teach  the\r\n\r\nincreased intensity subjects as recommended in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper,  although  at  a  reduced 1,300-1,700  hours,  are\r\n\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that, presently, a secondary\r\n\r\nschool  teacher spends more than 50 hours on average  per\r\n\r\nweek on teaching and related activities.  In a year, they\r\n\r\nspend   close  to  500  hours  on  non-teaching   related\r\n\r\nactivities, such as Sports Day or Speech Day.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nif  we  had thought about over-stretching our teachers  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  too  much.  The teachers  are  an  important\r\n\r\nresource; in fact, very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportant  in  achieving the goals set out in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is a key to having a competitive and\r\n\r\nhighly  qualified workforce.  One thing  is  certain:  as\r\n\r\nsure as there are jobs that have vanished forever, it  is\r\n\r\nalso  correct  to say that there are jobs that  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  configured yet.  It is vital, then, to prepare  our\r\n\r\nnation  and  our  people  with a  wide  exposure  through\r\n\r\neducation, so that the fit into tomorrow's job  evolution\r\n\r\nis  possible.  I think this is very important,  where  we\r\n\r\ncan  add to the talent pool that is culturally connected,\r\n\r\nespecially for our leaders-to-be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Singaporean, I urge all to support this\r\n\r\ninitiative to ensure that we stay ahead of the curve,  in\r\n\r\norder  that  we  may  survive  in  a  fast-changing   and\r\n\r\nuncertain  world.  As a parent, I urge all to  understand\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  these  changes  in  order  that  our\r\n\r\nchildren may have an opportunity to enjoy a more  diverse\r\n\r\nand broader education, and for our country's survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>1.25 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in\r\n\r\nthis  debate.  At the outset, let me declare that,  as  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  educator, I am very interested in the  motion\r\n\r\nfor obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the Review Committee in the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper, when implemented, will have a direct bearing\r\n\r\nand   significant  impact  on  university  education   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It will have major significance on  how  the\r\n\r\nuniversities will carry out their mission, as well as  on\r\n\r\nhow university faculty members like myself will discharge\r\n\r\nour  responsibilities.  I am therefore delighted to  rise\r\n\r\nin support of the motion in principle and, like my fellow\r\n\r\nparliamentarians who have spoken before me, wish  to  see\r\n\r\nthe  successful transformation of these and other changes\r\n\r\nthat  will  make JC and the diversified secondary  school\r\n\r\neducation truly meaningful and fulfilling for generations\r\n\r\nof students to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to congratulate the Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  for  its  bold  views,  vision  and  ideas  to\r\n\r\ntransform  part of the education system.   In  any  major\r\n\r\nchange effort, there is always the danger that a gap will\r\n\r\nemerge   between   policy  intention  and  implementation\r\n\r\naction.   Hence, it is necessary, indeed vital, for  pro-active  consultation, feedback and revisions to occur  at\r\n\r\nthe  conceptual and planning stages, and not  wait  until\r\n\r\nimplementation  time before improvements  will  be  made.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  we  have heard many thoughtful  and  useful\r\n\r\ncomments  and ideas in this House on what can and  should\r\n\r\nbe  done to bridge or narrow the gap between system ideal\r\n\r\nand  action realities.  It is in this spirit and with the\r\n\r\nwelcoming invitation of the Minister for Education that I\r\n\r\noffer my take on the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said in the past two days, and I will\r\n\r\nnot   belabour  some  of  the  same  points  that  I  had\r\n\r\noriginally  thought of but which have since been  brought\r\n\r\nup.   Some  of  my friends said that this  should  be  my\r\n\r\nmaiden  speech.  But I feel that actually I am  making  a\r\n\r\npage-boy  speech, since I am only left with a little  bit\r\n\r\nto  say,  so  as  not to repeat myself and  those  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I would like to touch on the bigger picture\r\n\r\nabout  our educational reforms.  The revision to  the  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum  and the inclusion of the three new  types  of\r\n\r\nsecondary school structures are not all there is  to  the\r\n\r\neducational reforms we need for our country.   They  form\r\n\r\nbut  part  of  the  bigger picture  called  the  learning\r\n\r\nrevolution,   in  which  active  learning  and   lifelong\r\n\r\neducation  are  the  key  words to  signal  the  type  of\r\n\r\neducation required in an innovation-driven and knowledge-based new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard, and sometimes robustly explained,\r\n\r\nthat   MOE  has  actually  been  overhauling  Singapore's\r\n\r\neducation  system over the years, the latest  being  this\r\n\r\nset  of  recommendations.  As such, the Review  Committee\r\n\r\ncame up with this new JC curriculum, the additional types\r\n\r\nof  secondary  education structures so as to  offer  more\r\n\r\nchoices  for students to receive an appropriate education\r\n\r\nat a pace suited to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir learning abilities and aptitudes.  Clearly, this is\r\n\r\nin   response   to  past  criticisms  about   our   rigid\r\n\r\neducational structure and system.  Nor in my  mind  would\r\n\r\nthis  be the last of the series of major changes  to  our\r\n\r\neducation system. Given this background, Sir, I think  it\r\n\r\nis  important that the public should understand where the\r\n\r\nchanges to the JC curriculum and secondary structures are\r\n\r\ncoming  from.  Unfortunately  - this is not the fault  of\r\n\r\nthe  Review  Committee - the White Paper did not  provide\r\n\r\nthis larger backdrop of how the proposed changes will fit\r\n\r\ninto the overall education system for Singapore.  That is\r\n\r\nwhy  we have a lot of ideas that sometimes touch on areas\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not fair for the Committee to have  commented\r\n\r\non.  I do not think that was in their terms of reference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to explain to the public, and even to\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House, since we all may not  have  been\r\n\r\nkeeping up with all the changes.  Whenever we think about\r\n\r\neducation, we tend to recall what we had gone through and\r\n\r\nuse  that  as part of the reference point.   We  need  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  what should be the overall educational  goals\r\n\r\nfor  the  whole  education system and  in  this,  I  even\r\n\r\ninclude  the pre-schools and not just primary, secondary,\r\n\r\nJC  or  tertiary institutions.  In the light of this  new\r\n\r\nworld  economic  order, we have to find out  whether  the\r\n\r\ndesired outcomes of education that MOE has spelt out some\r\n\r\nyears  back  do  need  revisiting and  updating  in  this\r\n\r\nglobalised  world.   I  would say  that,  whilst  we  are\r\n\r\nmindful of the need to have thinking students, a learning\r\n\r\nnation,  the  kind of education that we are striving  for\r\n\r\nshould  not  negate those earlier concerns we have  about\r\n\r\nwhat a true education should be.  And I recall many, many\r\n\r\nyears  back, SM Lee mentioning that we can be a  literate\r\n\r\nnation,  but  not necessarily an educated one.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  also needs restating.  In this regard, I have three\r\n\r\nmain concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the education outcomes of this revamp on the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  and new secondary school structures.  We  are\r\n\r\ntrying to redress some of the over-emphasis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  have  on  rote learning so that now we  can  be  more\r\n\r\ncreative, we can be thinking more imaginatively, we would\r\n\r\nhave the means to be able to be adaptable and flexible in\r\n\r\nthe  new  workforce, and so on and so forth.  However,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to caution that in doing so, we do not go  for\r\n\r\nform  over  substance as a result. We have heard  how  in\r\n\r\ncomparison  with overseas graduates, our local  graduates\r\n\r\nare  good  in following or executing orders, that  is  we\r\n\r\nhave  content knowledge.  But we are not so good when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  the  showmanship, the ability to present,  the\r\n\r\nability  to  bring issues up, debate them, discuss  them,\r\n\r\nand  so forth.  But I hope we can retain the best of both\r\n\r\nbecause  we need both work horses as well as show horses.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  important that students should be  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunities in this new revamped curriculum to be  show\r\n\r\nhorses  but not at the expense of being able  to  do  the\r\n\r\nwork.  An example of some of the dangers we have of  form\r\n\r\nover  substance  would  be, as my  colleague,  Dr  Maliki\r\n\r\nmentioned yesterday, the danger of students wanting to be\r\n\r\nspoon-fed  and not being original in their  answers.   In\r\n\r\nfact, they just 'cut and paste' from the Internet.   They\r\n\r\nplagiarised.  This is becoming an increasing concern  for\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we get them to be able to craft essays well\r\n\r\nand  project work well?  So the communication skills  are\r\n\r\nimportant.   But  I think some aspects of literature  and\r\n\r\nthe  humanities should also be grounded in  our  students\r\n\r\neven  though  they  are  in the  Science  or  Mathematics\r\n\r\nstream.   In  this  regard, having to  cross  disciplines\r\n\r\nwould be very welcoming.  But more importantly, Sir,  how\r\n\r\nwould  different groups of stakeholders  -  the  parents,\r\n\r\nprincipals,  teachers,  students and  employers  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  at  large  - take to all these proposed  changes?\r\n\r\nThere would be differential impact among the stakeholders\r\n\r\nhere   for   the   different  types  of   recommendations\r\n\r\nmentioned.   I  think  MOE needs to look  into  what  the\r\n\r\nvarious  stakeholders would feel and understand in  terms\r\n\r\nof the various recommendations.  The JC curriculum change\r\n\r\nis  one;  having the through-train is another;  and  then\r\n\r\nhaving specialised schools.  Probably, you will not  find\r\n\r\na uniform consensus on all the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanges.   It will differ.  I think we need to look  into\r\n\r\nthat.   For  instance, can there be room  for  more  life\r\n\r\nskill subjects to be taught, to be incorporated into  the\r\n\r\nnew  curriculum  for  the JCs and the  various  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  structures?   Even though they  are  specialised,\r\n\r\nprivate  or through-train, can we ensure that  they  form\r\n\r\npart  of  an  all-rounded  education  -  life  skills  on\r\n\r\ninterpersonal     relationship    building,     effective\r\n\r\ninterpersonal   communication  skills,   problem-solving,\r\n\r\nmediation,  negotiation, etc?  I know  that  elements  of\r\n\r\nthese are taught in the primary and secondary schools  at\r\n\r\ndifferent stages, but we should ensure that they continue\r\n\r\nand, in fact, go on even to the universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said that we need to have a\r\n\r\nmindset   change  for  us  to  comprehend  the   profound\r\n\r\nimplications  of  such  changes for  the  future  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren.  In this regard, the changes that we see around\r\n\r\nus,  the new global effect of terrorism, the need for  us\r\n\r\nto  go regional and to go global, require us that we also\r\n\r\nhave  a  good  understanding  of  our  neighbours,  their\r\n\r\nhistory,  their  literature,  their  culture.   In   this\r\n\r\nregard,  some of these should be incorporated, especially\r\n\r\nfor those who are going on to JCs and universities.  Even\r\n\r\nfor those who do not, if we want to create entrepreneurs,\r\n\r\nthey  will  also  need to have a good  knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket  conditions in the neighbouring countries and  the\r\n\r\nworld,  and these are subjected to social, political  and\r\n\r\neconomic forces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thread I would like to emphasise, and I\r\n\r\nshare  this with many of my parliamentary colleagues,  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  look at how, at the pre-primary  level,\r\n\r\nkindergartens  and  child  care  centres  have   actually\r\n\r\nincorporated project work.  If you look at  some  of  the\r\n\r\nchild   care   centres'   curriculum,   they   are   very\r\n\r\nimaginative.  Can we continue to ensure that this kind of\r\n\r\nactive learning will not be stifled at the primary level?\r\n\r\nIn  this, I share the sentiments of my colleagues that we\r\n\r\nshould not just stop with the IP and JC changes.  We have\r\n\r\nheard that it is easier to start at the JC level and  the\r\n\r\nupper  secondary rather than to revamp all the way  since\r\n\r\nwe have resource constraints.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  need  to build up our cadre of expertise, we need  to\r\n\r\nhave  the experience and we need to change mindsets  from\r\n\r\neducationalists all the way down to the employers and the\r\n\r\npublic.   I would like to emphasise that we have  started\r\n\r\nsomething that is needed, and it is something that we are\r\n\r\ngrappling with.  In some respects, we are going into  the\r\n\r\nunknown  as to how we can transform our education  system\r\n\r\nwhereby  multiple intelligences would be  recognised  and\r\n\r\nnurtured and not just focusing on a uni-dimension concept\r\n\r\nof intelligence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, the \"streaming\" and\r\n\r\n\"stress\"  issues that we have, in a way, with  all  these\r\n\r\nchanges going on, will force a rethink, hopefully in  the\r\n\r\nparents'  minds  of  the misplaced importance  that  they\r\n\r\nplace on just academic achievements.  Hopefully, we  will\r\n\r\ntake pains to explain to the public how a common tool now\r\n\r\non  ranking  will no longer be relevant.   New  forms  of\r\n\r\nranking  will, in fact, take place.  How do you  evaluate\r\n\r\nsomeone who comes through on a specialised school  system\r\n\r\nor  a  private school and rank him lineally from  top  to\r\n\r\nbottom?  Probably, you will have different categories and\r\n\r\nwe  will have to include efforts for project work and co-curricular activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably a way to force a crisis in the\r\n\r\nparents' minds.  So they will say, \"I need new guidance\".\r\n\r\nThat  is  where the role of MOE  and the schools  becomes\r\n\r\nvery  important now. We have to take pains to  guide  the\r\n\r\nparents   along.   We  need,  in  fact,   some   steering\r\n\r\ncommittee, some coordination, a better network of schools\r\n\r\nwith  the grassroots bodies and the VWOs coming  in.   In\r\n\r\nfact, Mr Speaker, Sir, I dare venture that even for  some\r\n\r\nof  these new types of schools, a closer, more deliberate\r\n\r\nattempt  to involve the community should be made  by  MOE\r\n\r\nand the schools so that all these very useful suggestions\r\n\r\nthat we have made will not just end up as records for  us\r\n\r\nto  look  through, but actually, where we  will  put  our\r\n\r\nwords  where  our mouth is and get us involved  with  the\r\n\r\nschools  in making sure that some of those ideas that  we\r\n\r\nchampion could actually be realised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I realise that when we create a\r\n\r\nmore  thinking  population, it is a  double-edged  sword.\r\n\r\nThere  are  also other societal changes that we  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  put  up with because a  more  thinking  and\r\n\r\ncreative educated citizenry of the future might also mean\r\n\r\na  certain  amount of critical feedback and  action,  and\r\n\r\ndemand  for  more  individual  choice,  more  freedom  of\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all part and parcel of fostering a climate\r\n\r\nof  intelligently thinking citizens so that  even  though\r\n\r\nthere is divergent thinking, we have convergent interests\r\n\r\nthat will propel Singapore as a first-world nation and we\r\n\r\nwill  continue our stride, and we can take  our  rightful\r\n\r\nplace  in this new world order.  As Mr Chan Soo  Sen  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  yesterday, there are many roads to  Rome.   In\r\n\r\nthis   set  of  recommendations,  we  are  allowing  some\r\n\r\nstudents  to take the road less travelled. We  wish  them\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although the 30 MPs before me have\r\n\r\ntouched  on most of the topics concerned, it is still  my\r\n\r\nduty  to rise and address these changes, especially  from\r\n\r\nthe non-PAP perspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I speak in support of this motion in principle.\r\n\r\nAlthough more can and should be done to make education  a\r\n\r\nlearning  and enjoyable experience, the proposed  changes\r\n\r\nare a good start and a good sign of more positive changes\r\n\r\nto come, especially and hopefully for the lower secondary\r\n\r\nand  primary  levels.   To that, I credit  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry and the Senior Minister of State, Mr Tharman and\r\n\r\nhis  Committee,  for taking the effort  to  identify  the\r\n\r\nshortcomings  of  our  education  system  and  make   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  changes  to make learning  more  relevant  and\r\n\r\nenjoyable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has built its reputation on an open\r\n\r\neconomy  and free trade. To that, let us work  towards  a\r\n\r\nthird  reputation,  and  that is \"creative  spontaneity\".\r\n\r\nSenior\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  Lee  had said that there is something  in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  that  causes  it  to have  more  \"buzz\",  and  that\r\n\r\nsomething  missing in our Singapore society  to  give  it\r\n\r\nmore   buzz   is  this  element  that  I  term  \"creative\r\n\r\nspontaneity\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to reduce the number of rules in our society\r\n\r\nand  allow our citizens and our young to generate greater\r\n\r\nspontaneity in their actions.  We also need to  free  the\r\n\r\nminds of our young and give them lots of room to explore;\r\n\r\nto  allow them to think out of the box and identify other\r\n\r\ndimensions  and  angles to a problem.  That  is  creative\r\n\r\nthinking  at work.  Together with the spontaneous  action\r\n\r\nto experiment and try, it will create greater buzz as our\r\n\r\nsociety  develops.  Our current education  system  churns\r\n\r\nout   a   production  line  of  workers,   managers   and\r\n\r\ninstruction  takers.  This used to satisfy the  needs  of\r\n\r\nour  industries  during our development  years,  but  not\r\n\r\nanymore.   We have reached a First World economy  and  no\r\n\r\nlonger  in the league of those cheap manufacturing bases.\r\n\r\nThe   road   ahead  is  unclear  and  paved  with   stiff\r\n\r\ncompetition.  Singapore businesses must compete on ideas,\r\n\r\ninnovation and originality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality and standards of our future workforce to\r\n\r\nbe churned out through our current education system is no\r\n\r\nlonger  going  to  be adequate.  We need  more  thinkers,\r\n\r\ncreators  and  innovators.  We do not  need  more  order-takers.   We  need them to be spontaneous and gung-ho  in\r\n\r\nspirit  and  in  action.   We also  need  to  remove  the\r\n\r\nstandard  pathways for future generations.   As  what  Mr\r\n\r\nChan  Soo Sen said yesterday, there is more than one road\r\n\r\nthat  leads  to  Rome.  And the road less  travelled  may\r\n\r\nbring  more  meaning  and fulfilment  to  life  than  the\r\n\r\ncongested  highways  that  every  graduate  seems  to  be\r\n\r\nscrambling to get on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be clear also in the minds of the students\r\n\r\nand  their  parents  that  having  a  degree  or  even  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  scholarship may not be the best  career  path\r\n\r\nfor  them  anymore.  If they are that good, they  do  not\r\n\r\nneed  a  scholarship to chart a future for them.   To  be\r\n\r\nvery  successful,  they  may  even  need  to  follow  the\r\n\r\nfootsteps of Bill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGates   -   leave  school and follow their  dreams.   The\r\n\r\nnature   of   careers  has  evolved  so   radically   and\r\n\r\ndramatically that there is no longer one standard  career\r\n\r\npathway.   For example, a person can be very highly  paid\r\n\r\njust by playing and testing computer games.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it also be clear in our young children's minds\r\n\r\nand  their  parents' that they do not need  a  degree  or\r\n\r\nscholarship  to  be successful in society  and  in  life.\r\n\r\nWhat  they need is this ability to free their minds  from\r\n\r\nthe  standard pathways set by the Government and society,\r\n\r\nand  take  the gung-ho spirit of \"can-do, just-do-it  and\r\n\r\nnever-say-die\" spirit.  It is no longer what  degrees  or\r\n\r\nscholarships  you  have  that  are  important,  but  what\r\n\r\ninnovative  ideas  and patents you  own  that  make  your\r\n\r\nfuture.  We need to be creative and to be spontaneous  at\r\n\r\nthat too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the proposed Junior College and Upper Secondary\r\n\r\neducation review is fully implemented across all schools,\r\n\r\nI  hope this new cohort will be the generation that  will\r\n\r\nbring  about  more buzz and vibrancy into our Singaporean\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I first mentioned in the debate on the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement in May, there is a great need to develop\r\n\r\n\"thinking creativity\" in our young.  We need to inculcate\r\n\r\nthe  inquisitive spirit in them.  They need to  learn  to\r\n\r\nask tough questions like \"why\" and \"why not\", and develop\r\n\r\nthe  courage  and tenacity to explore and  give  it  many\r\n\r\ntries.   By  asking  \"why\", they  learn  to  explore  the\r\n\r\nfundamental concerns surrounding that issue, and  develop\r\n\r\ntheir  own justification that they will internalise  into\r\n\r\ntheir  being.  So, questions asked by Senior Minister  of\r\n\r\nState Dr Vivian Balakrishnan's son like, \"Why must I  die\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore?\" is highly relevant and important to  the\r\n\r\npsychological and character development of the child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To survive and prosper in this knowledge economy, we\r\n\r\nneed  to  free  our minds.  The revised  JC  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nthinking and communication skills is a good start, but it\r\n\r\nis  not enough.  Like what Dr Jennifer Lee mentioned  the\r\n\r\nday before, the Education Ministry needs to bring it all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  way  down  to  pre-primary and primary  level.   The\r\n\r\nchildren  in  the  schools need to be encouraged  to  ask\r\n\r\nquestions,  and tough questions too.  The  teachers  need\r\n\r\nnot  have  all the answers to these tough questions  like\r\n\r\n\"why\"  or \"why not\".  But at the very least, the teachers\r\n\r\nshould  encourage these questions, and force the students\r\n\r\nto  go home and think about it for the next few days, and\r\n\r\nask their parents or their friends.  We will be surprised\r\n\r\nby  the  range of replies that could be thrown up by  the\r\n\r\nchildren in their search for answers.  Participation  and\r\n\r\nanswers  with wit or originality should be given  greater\r\n\r\nassessment credits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such processes will also build up the communicative\r\n\r\nskills  in  our  young  children  to  communicate   their\r\n\r\nthinking  and  ideas to the class and  authorities  in  a\r\n\r\nbenign  setting.   This will be the key to  their  future\r\n\r\nsuccess, and has to be done starting from primary  level.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be  too late to turn the engine of thinking  on\r\n\r\nonly when they reach the JC level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I see it now, if there is one skill that\r\n\r\ninternational    talents   have   in    abundance    over\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, it is their ability to talk their  way  out\r\n\r\nand  argue convincingly.  Singaporeans are often  tongue-tied and stuck when confronted.  And this has nothing  to\r\n\r\ndo with genetics, mind you, but how we were brought up in\r\n\r\nour education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When young, students are constantly told to shut up\r\n\r\nand  do  not  make too much noise, nor to  ask  too  many\r\n\r\nquestions  in  class.   This suppression  has  become  so\r\n\r\nstrongly internalised in our young, so much so that  they\r\n\r\ngrow  up  learning to keep quiet and shut their mouth   - to the detriment of a creative society at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Ministry needs to break this bad\r\n\r\npractice.  Stop stopping the asking of questions  by  our\r\n\r\nchildren  in primary and lower secondary level.  Instead,\r\n\r\nmake  them  ask questions, and force them  to  think  and\r\n\r\nsearch for their own answers.  Then, when they reach  the\r\n\r\nupper   secondary  and  JC  level,  encourage   them   to\r\n\r\narticulate it out and defend their answers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen  that is successfully done, there will be more  hope\r\n\r\nfor our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate greater interactions between\r\n\r\nstudents and teachers, the class size needs to be cut.  A\r\n\r\nbig  class  is  useful  for the  one-way  impartation  of\r\n\r\nknowledge.   However, it is not going to be effective  if\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to encourage more speaking  up  and  more\r\n\r\ninteractions.  When classes are too big, there is no  way\r\n\r\na  teacher  can handle a class of 40 talkative  students.\r\n\r\nThe  only  way to control such a big class  is  to  order\r\n\r\neveryone  to  keep quiet, and punish those that  do  not.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  going  to  help in teaching  our  students\r\n\r\ncommunicative skills later on in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a young age, the students will have\r\n\r\ninternalised  into their sub-conscious that  speaking  up\r\n\r\nwill  bring  about negative consequences and  punishment,\r\n\r\nand  will  resist all attempts in speaking up.   This  is\r\n\r\noperant  conditioning  at work.  The  Education  Ministry\r\n\r\nneeds to recognise this aspect and work hard to eradicate\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children and future leaders must be equipped\r\n\r\nwith the right thinking skills to reinvent themselves and\r\n\r\nacquire specific work skills to stay relevant.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  job security these days.  The fact is that, globally,\r\n\r\nwe  are  moving towards a free agent nation   -   towards\r\n\r\ncontract and self-employment.  Having a degree or even  a\r\n\r\nscholarship is only useful for those who want an easy and\r\n\r\nwell-paved life, and may even be a psychological  barrier\r\n\r\ntowards greater personal achievement in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the second part\r\n\r\nof  the  motion   -   having greater  diversity  and  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  new  pathways  to  cater  to  the  different\r\n\r\nstrengths  of  students.  As several MPs before  me  have\r\n\r\nraised,   there  is  concern  about  these  new  pathways\r\n\r\nbecoming another form of streaming and a higher  form  of\r\n\r\nelitism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is room for genuine concern. While I\r\n\r\napplaud  this move to open up more pathways, I  hope  the\r\n\r\nnew privately-run schools will not be a gathering place\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor the average sons of the rich, famous or connected.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Ministry will put sufficient checks in place  to\r\n\r\nensure that only the top per cent in each cohort will  be\r\n\r\nadmitted   -  based on intelligence and academic ability,\r\n\r\nand not on family backgrounds, links or contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, with the introduction of the Integrated\r\n\r\nProgrammes in selected schools, I expect greater emphasis\r\n\r\nto  be  given  in  the area of co-curricular  activities,\r\n\r\nvalues  upbringing,  character  building  and  leadership\r\n\r\ntraining.   It is one thing to channel our best resources\r\n\r\nto  train our brightest students for their future.  It is\r\n\r\nanother  when  the  desired outcomes of such  specialised\r\n\r\ntraining  fail to deliver a future generation of  leaders\r\n\r\nwho   are  committed  to  Singapore,  and  improving  our\r\n\r\nSingaporean society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a failure of our education system if we\r\n\r\nare  to  train  our  best  and brightest  with  our  best\r\n\r\nresources  only  to be told that they  are  going  to  be\r\n\r\nquitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion\r\n\r\nfor  the  weak  and the down; or that they  behave  in  a\r\n\r\nsnobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to\r\n\r\ntheir  peers and followers; or that the elites only  care\r\n\r\nabout  their  own  self-interests.   The  elites  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety  must  appreciate the opportunity  and  resources\r\n\r\ngiven to train and develop them, and seek to return  back\r\n\r\nto  society  -  more than what they have taken  from  it.\r\n\r\nThis will be the way for our society to grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, values of integrity and character building\r\n\r\nshould be a key emphasis in these IP schools.  As it  is,\r\n\r\nI   have  come  across  very  bright  scholars  and  very\r\n\r\nbrilliant individuals  -  the elite among their cohort  - who  lack the values of integrity and honesty; who behave\r\n\r\ncondescendingly  to  their peers and think  themselves  a\r\n\r\nclass above the rest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such is the end result of these Integrated\r\n\r\nProgrammes, we would have failed in our education process\r\n\r\nand  as a society in teaching our young the values of our\r\n\r\nsociety.  It is useless to train our students to  be  the\r\n\r\nbest  and  brightest in the world if these common  values\r\n\r\nlike patience,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nkindness,  gentleness, compassion, integrity and  respect\r\n\r\nfor  others  are  not  internalised  into  the  character\r\n\r\nbuilding process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  in these proposed changes, I hope the Education\r\n\r\nMinistry will also give greater emphasis to the character\r\n\r\nbuilding process of the individual.  Let us not  build  a\r\n\r\ncity  without  a  soul, nor develop a  person  without  a\r\n\r\nstrong character.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  motion  in the name  of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation.  Let me start by making a few observations  on\r\n\r\nthe  process by which the recommendations of  the  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee were formed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a consultative process, drawing on a diverse\r\n\r\nconstituencies.   The  Review  Committee  itself  was   a\r\n\r\ndiverse one, with politicians like Ahmad Khalis, Chan Soo\r\n\r\nSen    and   myself,   educationists,   private    sector\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs,   scientists and a few  senior  officials.\r\n\r\nWe  also  consulted  widely with parents  and  employers,\r\n\r\nbesides  educationists themselves, ie  the  teachers  and\r\n\r\nprincipals in our schools.  The major directions that are\r\n\r\nrecommended in the Report were strongly supported amongst\r\n\r\nall  these constituencies - the university academics, the\r\n\r\nteachers in our schools, parents and employers.   It  was\r\n\r\nnot  a  situation where people outside the Ministry  were\r\n\r\nchallenging the MOE to change the system and the MOE  was\r\n\r\ndoing  the  defending.  I must say that my colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  were  themselves amongst  the  boldest  of\r\n\r\nvision  and  amongst the most anxious to get  ahead  with\r\n\r\nchanges  that will prepare our students well for  a  very\r\n\r\ndifferent future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a common recognition that the Singapore\r\n\r\nsystem has strengths that we would not like to erode.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  system that provides a rigorous education,  and  a\r\n\r\nsystem  that  encourages  every  student,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nability and talent, to aim\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhigh and to work hard to achieve something more than what\r\n\r\nhe can achieve easily.  It is a system that stretches and\r\n\r\nchallenges every student, and that is a strength.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was also a common perception that our\r\n\r\npast   and   current  achievements do not  assure  us  of\r\n\r\nsuccess  in a future that is going to be quite  different\r\n\r\nfrom  what  we  are used to. We have to  change  to  stay\r\n\r\nrelevant to the shifting demands of an innovation  driven\r\n\r\nera  and an environment that will, in one way or another,\r\n\r\nplace  an increasing premium on flexibility - flexibility\r\n\r\nin  the  workplace, as well as the ability to  adjust  to\r\n\r\nensure that we remain a strong society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot say precisely how we have to prepare for\r\n\r\nthis  more  fluid innovation-driven future.   After  all,\r\n\r\nthere is no direct means of training innovation, there is\r\n\r\nno  direct  means of producing flexibility.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount of buzz-words and catch-phrases  that  we\r\n\r\nall use - you will find some of it in the Report, and  it\r\n\r\nhas been repeated in the debate.  And sometimes the catch-phrases assume a certain precision  in what we are trying\r\n\r\nto do.  But there is no precision .  We know that we have\r\n\r\nto  make  major shifts in direction, but  a  lot  of  the\r\n\r\nsubstance and details will need to be worked out as we go\r\n\r\nalong, intelligently and carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have been struck by is the freshness and\r\n\r\nboldness of perspective that we derived from everyone  we\r\n\r\nhave  consulted,  and in this debate itself. There  is  a\r\n\r\ndesire  to  push forward, make the major shifts  now,  so\r\n\r\nthat we can stay ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensity of the debate reflects the importance\r\n\r\nwhich Singaporeans, and which Members of the House, place\r\n\r\non  education, for Singapore's future.  Education is  our\r\n\r\nmost   important   strategy  for   long   term   economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  and it is our most  important  strategy\r\n\r\nfor  building a strong society.  But there is recognition\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no single formula for preparing  students\r\n\r\nfor  the  future,  no optimal path, no  golden  mean,  no\r\n\r\nunique set of skills and talents that will secure our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfuture.  There is a recognition that we need more diverse\r\n\r\ntalents,  more diverse Singaporean talents, and  we  will\r\n\r\nnot get this unless we nurture, groom and train our young\r\n\r\nalong  diverse  paths, each no less  important  than  the\r\n\r\nother.  And all Singaporean students, regardless of paths\r\n\r\nthey  go through, ending up Singaporean in character  and\r\n\r\nin  spirit.  Or as Dr Ngiam says , we can have  divergent\r\n\r\nthinking, but we must have convergent interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad directions have been well supported. But\r\n\r\nat  the  heart  of the debate, we really  have  questions\r\n\r\nabout balance in education, in four respects.  First, the\r\n\r\nbalance  between depth and breadth of study, particularly\r\n\r\nin  the  junior college years; second, a balance  between\r\n\r\nstructure and flexibility of choice; third, preserving  a\r\n\r\nrigorous  and challenging education, without  overloading\r\n\r\nour  students;  and  fourth, achieving  diversity  whilst\r\n\r\npreserving  a  sense of commonality amongst Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nThese  are  inherent  tensions in education.  The  debate\r\n\r\nreflects  these  tensions, and it  is  as  well  that  we\r\n\r\naddress these squarely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reached the stage of advancement where there\r\n\r\nare  no easy models for us to borrow or  import.  We have\r\n\r\noutgrown the UK system of \"A\" level education, and  there\r\n\r\nis  no  new UK model that is satisfactory for us, or  any\r\n\r\nother  foreign model that we can import and implant.   We\r\n\r\nhave  looked  carefully  at other  foreign  systems,  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Baccalaureate systems, the US system  and  other\r\n\r\nAsian  systems.  They all have their strengths  but  they\r\n\r\nalso have their weaknesses.  And they are all looking  to\r\n\r\nreform their systems with the same considerations that we\r\n\r\nhave  - to prepare for a rather different future.  We can\r\n\r\nlearn  lessons from them as we go along, but we  have  to\r\n\r\nchart our own destiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address some of the key issues of balance\r\n\r\nthat I have just mentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, concerning the JC curriculum. The key issue\r\n\r\nis one of depth as against\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbreadth.  It  is  a non-trivial issue.   There  is  broad\r\n\r\nsupport  for greater breadth of learning amongst  our  JC\r\n\r\nstudents.  We have been moving in that direction  at  the\r\n\r\nuniversities,   we  have  a  fairly   broad   \"O\"   level\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  but as Ahmad Khalis said, there  is  a  coca\r\n\r\ncola structure,  in which the JC education we provide  in\r\n\r\nbetween  is  too highly specialised.  So there  is  broad\r\n\r\nrecognition  that we have to broaden out.   There  are  a\r\n\r\nnumber of reasons why this  is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, of course, it is important for students who\r\n\r\nare  going  to  be  citizens in a modern, knowledge-based\r\n\r\nworld  to  have a grounding in different areas, different\r\n\r\ndisciplines.   It is intrinsic to a good education.   And\r\n\r\nas  Warren  Lee  pointed out, it  is  important  that  we\r\n\r\nprovide,  especially  for students from  less  privileged\r\n\r\nhomes,  this  ability to receive a broad exposure   which\r\n\r\nthey would not always receive very easily at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and this is a significant change in\r\n\r\nenvironment,  it  is becoming more difficult  for  us  to\r\n\r\npredict  the  type of specialisations  that  will  be  in\r\n\r\ndemand  in  future.   Job definitions are  changing  more\r\n\r\nfrequently,  people  are having  to  shift  careers  more\r\n\r\nfrequently.   Even our fresh graduates, if  you  look  at\r\n\r\nrecent years, our fresh graduates in various disciplines,\r\n\r\nespecially   the   engineering   disciplines,   a    very\r\n\r\nsubstantial number move on to different vocations, either\r\n\r\nthe  moment they graduate, or within two or three  years.\r\n\r\nSo  early  specialisation  is not  helpful  in  preparing\r\n\r\nourselves for an environment where there will be frequent\r\n\r\nchange  in  specialisations,  continuous  change  in  the\r\n\r\nnature of skills that are advantageous in the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and most importantly, the reason why we\r\n\r\nneed  a  broad  education is that we need to  expose  our\r\n\r\nstudents  to  different  methods of  thinking,  different\r\n\r\nmethods  of  learning, different methods of training  the\r\n\r\nmind.   A  breadth of education in the sciences  and  the\r\n\r\nhumanities  is  one way of achieving this.   The  present\r\n\r\nsituation is not optimal.  There are some details in  the\r\n\r\nReport,  but  40%  of our \"A\" level candidature  do  only\r\n\r\nScience and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMathematics subjects.   Of course, they have got  General\r\n\r\nPaper,  project work, mother tongue, on top of that,  but\r\n\r\nas  far as the content  disciplines are concerned, 40% do\r\n\r\nonly   Science   and  Mathematics,  and   that   is   not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me address an alternative view, which has\r\n\r\nbeen,  I think, quite well articulated by Prof. Low  Seow\r\n\r\nChay.  Prof.  Low's argument is that the  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy needs individuals with specialised knowledge that\r\n\r\nwill give us an edge over others.  And the broadening  of\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum, he sees as lowering standards.  Lowering\r\n\r\nstandards where it counts.  His view is that the thinking\r\n\r\nskills  that  we are talking about are best  achieved  by\r\n\r\nchanging  teaching methods and learning  methods,  rather\r\n\r\nthan  changing the specialised curriculum that  we  have.\r\n\r\nIt is a coherent view and  worth addressing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I agree that it is important to retain a\r\n\r\ncertain  depth of learning in core disciplines.  This  is\r\n\r\nour  strength and we do not want to lose it.   We  should\r\n\r\nnot  lose  the  advantage of a strong grounding  in  core\r\n\r\ndisciplines.  It has held our students very well wherever\r\n\r\nthey   go  -  including  top  UK  universities,  top   US\r\n\r\nuniversities.   But  the  present system  of  specialised\r\n\r\ntraining  at  an  early  age  -  and  this  is  what  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  academics  and  those  who  are  involved  in\r\n\r\nresearch   -  is not well geared to future  demands  even\r\n\r\nwithin  the core disciplines.  In other words, if we  are\r\n\r\nto  encourage innovation in the sciences and engineering,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, we need a broader education to begin with,\r\n\r\nbefore  you  finally  go  on at the  graduate  and  post-graduate  stage  to  specialise.  This  is  an  important\r\n\r\nshift.    The  British  have  been  a  little  later   in\r\n\r\nrecognising  this than the Americans, but they  are  also\r\n\r\nnow  moving in this direction. It is a  recognition  that\r\n\r\nearly specialisation is not necessarily the best route to\r\n\r\ndeveloping   the   innovative  abilities   and   research\r\n\r\nabilities  required as you move up the  value  curve,  in\r\n\r\nmanufacturing or in services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the key question is: how do we best train\r\n\r\ninnovative  minds during the school and   junior  college\r\n\r\nyears?   Do  we  do  it  best by specialising  in  a  few\r\n\r\ndisciplines or by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexposing students to a range of disciplines?  And  I  ask\r\n\r\nthis   question  whilst  recognising,  of   course,   the\r\n\r\nfundamental  truth,  that teaching methods  and  learning\r\n\r\nmethods  are  critical, whatever you study.  Whether  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum is specialised or broad, teaching methods will\r\n\r\nbe   critical, probably most important at the end of  the\r\n\r\nday.  But it should not distract us from important issues\r\n\r\nof  structure  in curriculum, within which  teaching  and\r\n\r\nlearning take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some depth is necessary because to train your mind,\r\n\r\nwhether  rigorous conceptual analysis, logical  thinking,\r\n\r\nor innovative thinking, you have to study something to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  level  of  difficulty, whatever  it  is.   So  a\r\n\r\ncertain  level  of  depth in any subject,  in  your  core\r\n\r\ndiscipline, is necessary in order to train your mind.  It\r\n\r\nis also important to know some content.  Education is not\r\n\r\njust  about  skills  as distinct from  content.   Without\r\n\r\ncontent,  you  have a vacuum in which you would  find  it\r\n\r\nvery difficult to shape your skills.  That is why we have\r\n\r\nchosen  not to import wholesale, features of some foreign\r\n\r\ncurriculum  systems  that  we looked  at,  including  the\r\n\r\nInternational  Baccalaureate  and  in  large   part   the\r\n\r\nAmerican High School System,  which have the strength  of\r\n\r\nproviding  a  broad education but  are not  renowned  for\r\n\r\nrigour   of   training,  particularly  in   Science   and\r\n\r\nMathematics.   Well  suited for some  students,  but  not\r\n\r\nsuited for all.  And in refashioning a JC curriculum  for\r\n\r\na  large 25% of cohort, you have got to make sure that it\r\n\r\nhas  features which meet the needs of the majority of  JC\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So depth is important and we do not want to dilute\r\n\r\nit  too much.  But we are going to need more breadth  for\r\n\r\nthe  future than we have had in the past, to groom future\r\n\r\nscientists, bankers, managers, anyone who wants to  be  a\r\n\r\ngood  specialist  eventually  will  be  advantaged  by  a\r\n\r\ncertain breadth of education early on.  We are no  longer\r\n\r\nimporting knowledge, but having to create knowledge.   We\r\n\r\nare   moving  up  the  value  curve  -  innovating,   not\r\n\r\nreplicating.   It  would  require  an  ability  to   spot\r\n\r\nopportunities, see connections and patterns in  disparate\r\n\r\nevents and phenomena, and make decisions in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsituations of uncertainty and ambiguity.  None of this is\r\n\r\nnew,  but it will be much more present with us in  future\r\n\r\nthan  it  has  been  in the past.   And  it  will  be  an\r\n\r\nadvantage  hto have multiple perspectives, and habits  of\r\n\r\nminds  that are shaped from having gone through  learning\r\n\r\nin multiple discliplines .  We need many faceted minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip Yeo is right - to succeed as a biomedical\r\n\r\nhub  we  need many more Masters and PhD graduates amongst\r\n\r\nour  Singaporeans.   But the question  is:   what  should\r\n\r\ntheir  earlier education look like?  What should   school\r\n\r\nand  junior college education  be to best groom   Masters\r\n\r\nand  PhD graduates of excellence in the sciences  or  any\r\n\r\nother  field?  We cannot specialise too early if we  want\r\n\r\nto  develop multiple frames and habits of mind  that  are\r\n\r\nnecessary to do well in an innovation-driven climate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, I accompanied Minister Teo Chee\r\n\r\nHean  to  the UK.  We were  studying how they are coping,\r\n\r\nhow  they are trying to reform their system to cope  with\r\n\r\nsimilar demands of the future.  One of the people we  met\r\n\r\nwas  Prof.  Peter  Goddard, Master of St John's  College,\r\n\r\nCambridge, and Chairman of UCLES (University of Cambridge\r\n\r\nLocal  Examinations Syndicate). He was, by profession,  a\r\n\r\nProfessor of Theoretical Physics.  We asked him what were\r\n\r\nthe  attributes that he and his colleagues in  the  field\r\n\r\nlooked for at the  'A' level stage,  that they considered\r\n\r\nimportant  in  grooming or in producing  future  research\r\n\r\nscientists  in  the area of Physics.  He  thought  for  a\r\n\r\nwhile - he did not give us a pat answer - and then  said,\r\n\r\nfirst, Mathematics is important.  He wanted to make  sure\r\n\r\nthe  person is good at Mathematics and has learnt it with\r\n\r\na  certain  degree of rigour.  Second, he said  reasoning\r\n\r\nskills,  an ability to think differently and to transcend\r\n\r\ndisciplines, to think outside the box.  So I  asked  him:\r\n\r\nwhat   about  Physics?   My  question  was  really  about\r\n\r\ntraining research scientists in Physics.  He said,  well,\r\n\r\nit  is  optional, not strictly  necessary.  Helpful,  but\r\n\r\nnot really necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this illustrates the point - the importance\r\n\r\nof  a  multi-disciplinary orientation to breed  reasoning\r\n\r\nskills  and learning skills that are not uniform and  not\r\n\r\nsingular, a range of learning skills and thinking skills.\r\n\r\nSo  we have got to shift focus, broaden the curriculum in\r\n\r\norder to develop these skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sciences and Mathematics provide very useful\r\n\r\ntraining, as Prof. Low Seow Chay says, provide very  good\r\n\r\ngrounding   in   logical  thinking  and  in  experimental\r\n\r\nmethod.  But it is not satisfactory that the majority  of\r\n\r\nour  Science students at JC do not take humanities.   The\r\n\r\nhumanities,  by and large, are better placed at  training\r\n\r\nan   ability  to  appreciate   ambiguity  and  deal  with\r\n\r\nambiguity.  There are no right answers in the humanities.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a range of possible interpretations  on  every\r\n\r\nquestion.   Every  time, you read  the  Mahabharatha,  or\r\n\r\nDream of The Red Chamber, you get a different lesson  and\r\n\r\na different meaning.  Almost every economics question you\r\n\r\nask   does not have a deterministic answer.  There  is  a\r\n\r\nrange  of  possible answers and a  degree of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  linear  fashion in which  monetary  policy\r\n\r\ndetermines a certain rate of inflation or shapes economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.  There is no one way to balance a budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to look at what the specialised\r\n\r\nschools  in  Science and Mathematics abroad do  in  their\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   These are schools aimed at gearing  budding\r\n\r\nscientists,  and  I  am referring here  to  schools  like\r\n\r\nThomas  Jefferson High School for Science and Technology,\r\n\r\nin  the Washington DC area.  There is a similar school in\r\n\r\nIllinois   and  you  have  got  Bronx  High,  Stuyvesant,\r\n\r\nBrooklyn  Technical High in New York.  We have spoken  to\r\n\r\ntheir  curriculum designers and they are  very  clear  in\r\n\r\ntheir  minds  that they want to ensure that students  who\r\n\r\naim  to  be  budding scientists must have  a  breadth  of\r\n\r\nlearning  at that age.  Thomas Jefferson is  the  typical\r\n\r\ncase  of  a Science and Mathematics school.  They require\r\n\r\nthat  students  take  credits to the  advanced  level  in\r\n\r\nLanguages,   Social   Studies,  Fine  Arts,   Humanities.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,   you  cannot  graduate.    Typically,   these\r\n\r\nspecialist schools\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill require that at least 20%, but usually more, of your\r\n\r\ncredits are in a contrasting area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise for schools of the Arts, there are a few\r\n\r\nthat you find internationally, and I visited one recently\r\n\r\nin  San Francisco - broad curriculum, strong emphasis  on\r\n\r\nMathematics and Science, although it was a  School of the\r\n\r\nArts.   They  distinguish  themselves  from  the  average\r\n\r\nschool  by  putting  an added emphasis  on  the  area  of\r\n\r\nspecialisation  that  they were known  for,  often  going\r\n\r\nbeyond  regular  curriculum hours, and more  importantly,\r\n\r\nadopting a different method of learning.  So the  Science\r\n\r\nand Mathematics school adopts quite a different method of\r\n\r\nlearning in Science and Mathematics.  And the Arts school\r\n\r\nlikewise  - different ways of experimenting with methods,\r\n\r\ndifferent  activities  for the students  rather  than  an\r\n\r\naltogether different curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think the proposed JC curriculum framework\r\n\r\nachieves  the  right balance.  We have tried  to  take  a\r\n\r\nholistic  view  of  how best we can develop  a  range  of\r\n\r\nthinking  skills.  We have to broaden out,  but  we  must\r\n\r\navoid  a  shallow exploration of subjects that  does  not\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  mind.  We need to study a few  subjects  in\r\n\r\nsome  depth  but  within  a stronger,  multi-disciplinary\r\n\r\norientation.  It is not just the core subjects that  will\r\n\r\nachieve this. Project work, GP and the new Knowledge  and\r\n\r\nInquiry  subject  will  enhance  this  multi-disciplinary\r\n\r\norientation.  They will also enhance our ability to build\r\n\r\nup communication skills amongst our JC students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, finally, training of conceptual thinking skills\r\n\r\nhas  to  take place across the curriculum, regardless  of\r\n\r\nsubject.    This  is  where  teaching  methods,  learning\r\n\r\nmethods  are quite important and changes in our  mode  of\r\n\r\nassessment, which I will come to briefly later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so keen on some of the other suggestions\r\n\r\nfor  the types of disciplines we should introduce at  JC.\r\n\r\nMs Braema Mathiaparanam mentioned sociology, anthropology\r\n\r\nand  a  range of others.  Mr Gan Kim Yong and some others\r\n\r\nmentioned management studies.  These are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninteresting subjects.  At the university level, there  is\r\n\r\nusually  opportunity  to take an elective  or  option  in\r\n\r\nthese  subjects, if not to specialise  in  them.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  should  keep  our  JC  curriculum  focused  on\r\n\r\nfundamental  disciplines,   disciplines  where  you   can\r\n\r\ndevelop conceptual thinking abilities as well as a  basic\r\n\r\nappreciation of the core areas of knowledge, and then  go\r\n\r\non  from  there to specialise when you are in university.\r\n\r\nI do not want to say this in a doctrinaire fashion.  But,\r\n\r\nas a matter of priority and balance, I would say we stick\r\n\r\nto the fundamental disciplines for now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the non-academic curriculum which\r\n\r\nseveral  Members  have  spoken on quite  eloquently,  and\r\n\r\nwhich   I   agree  on  completely.   CCA  and   Character\r\n\r\nDevelopment Programme (CDP) - we have not spelt it out at\r\n\r\ngreat  length in the report.  But it is a very  important\r\n\r\ncomponent of the  broader and more rounded education that\r\n\r\nwe  would  like to see our JC students go  through.   Not\r\n\r\njust  because  it provides you with the skills  to  be  a\r\n\r\nuseful  citizen,  or to raise a strong family,  but  also\r\n\r\nbecause these are the life skills required to succeed  in\r\n\r\neven  your career, in any endeavour.  Ms Indranee had  an\r\n\r\nexample  of an international law firm that looks  at  the\r\n\r\ncandidate's   CV to see what team sports he  has  played.\r\n\r\nIt  is  one  that  is replicated in many sectors  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy when you talk to firms that think hard about  how\r\n\r\nthey  select their people.  They will often look at  what\r\n\r\nyou  did  in CCA.  It may not always be team sports,  but\r\n\r\nthey  look at what you did to see whether you might  have\r\n\r\nacquired instincts and habits that are different from the\r\n\r\nrest.  So the non-academic curriculum is integral to  the\r\n\r\nJC  education.  We make some recommendations as to how we\r\n\r\ncan  increase  emphasis  on it,  including  a  change  in\r\n\r\nweighting at the university admission system.  But a  lot\r\n\r\nwill  depend  on  how  principals and  school  leadership\r\n\r\nactually conduct their programmes in the school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the issue of structure versus flexibility of\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   We  have debated this  extensively  in  the\r\n\r\nReview  Committee  and in the consultation  process:  how\r\n\r\nmuch should we prescribe and how much we leave to choice,\r\n\r\nespecially in the JC\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurriculum?   Dr John Chen says, perhaps we should  leave\r\n\r\nit to \"moral suasion\" rather than prescribe that you must\r\n\r\ntake a contrasting subject.  I do not agree with that.  I\r\n\r\nthink  we are quite clear that a broader education  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessity  and we should make that a requirement  of  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum.  But we should retain flexibility of choices.\r\n\r\nWhich  contrasting subject you take can be  left  to  the\r\n\r\nstudent.   We  have decided, after extensive  discussion,\r\n\r\nnot   to   go   down  the  route  of  the   International\r\n\r\nBaccalaureate, or the American High School system,  where\r\n\r\nyou are mandated to take a wide  breadth of subjects.  It\r\n\r\nis  quite a noble aspiration, but it has some of the side\r\n\r\neffects  I  mentioned earlier, a certain  shallowness  in\r\n\r\nareas where you rather have more depth.  It does not play\r\n\r\nto  Singapore's  strengths  and  what  we  need  for  the\r\n\r\nforeseeable future.  So let us allow a range of options - provide students the flexibility of choice and give  them\r\n\r\nthese  three levels of subjects - H1, H2, H3  -  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can go for configurations that suit their individual\r\n\r\npreferences and talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have the JCs offering more combinations of\r\n\r\nsubjects,  as  well,  more than they  have  done  in  the\r\n\r\npastThere are a fair number of combinations you will find\r\n\r\nin  our junior colleges, both in Sciences and Humanities.\r\n\r\nI  think it was Dr John Chen who said you cannot do  both\r\n\r\nLiterature and Biology.  It will be possible to  do  that\r\n\r\nin  future.   But  it  is  not a situation  of  more  the\r\n\r\nmerrier.    It   is   important  that   students   choose\r\n\r\ncombinations  that are meaningful and that  expand  their\r\n\r\nopportunities.   And as many Members  have  pointed  out,\r\n\r\nschools  will need to engage in counselling  of  students\r\n\r\nand  advise  on how they can choose subjects  that  match\r\n\r\ntheir  talents,  match  their  interests  and  match  the\r\n\r\nopportunities they could have in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, workload. This is an important and valid\r\n\r\nissue that came up most frequently in the debate.  If you\r\n\r\nwant greater breadth while retaining a certain amount  of\r\n\r\ndepth in all disciplines, something has to give.  As many\r\n\r\nhave pointed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nout, breadth is intrinsically a little more difficult for\r\n\r\nthe student to handle.  It requires more time on the part\r\n\r\nof  the  student.  As Mr Cedric Foo has pointed out,  you\r\n\r\nalso  need  more  time to provide for  a  learner-centred\r\n\r\neducation.  It takes more time to learn independently and\r\n\r\nin curious ways, as distinct from listening to a lecture.\r\n\r\nAs  Mr  Iswaran has also pointed out, you need some  down\r\n\r\ntime  in the system for students to reflect and to detect\r\n\r\ninter-linkages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE agrees with this. We want to see what we can do\r\n\r\nto reduce total curriculum load.  First, however, we will\r\n\r\nalso address  the JC calendar which has some inefficiency\r\n\r\nbuilt  into  it, a large amount of wastage in  the  first\r\n\r\nthree  months.  So we will implement a  system that  will\r\n\r\nhave   a  single  JC  intake,  therefore  reducing   that\r\n\r\ninefficiency and expanding the length of the real  school\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the curriculum itself, we will have to prune the\r\n\r\nsize   of  each  subject,  prune  down  content,   whilst\r\n\r\nretaining  the  rigour of learning that  is  entailed  in\r\n\r\nlearning  that subject.  It has to be a careful exercise,\r\n\r\nwhich  MOE  will  do  in  close  consultation  with   the\r\n\r\nuniversities, to make sure that our students continue  to\r\n\r\nbe well prepared for any discipline that they take in our\r\n\r\nuniversities.  It is not a simple issue of chopping off a\r\n\r\nsubject  halfway and thinking that makes  for  a  lighter\r\n\r\nload.  We have got to make sure that we avoid shallowness\r\n\r\nof  treatment.   It probably means we have  fewer  topics\r\n\r\nwithin a particular subject, but you still need to have a\r\n\r\ncertain depth of treatment of each topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are clear about our intention to reduce the\r\n\r\ncurriculum load.  We will work out the details  carefully\r\n\r\nto  make  sure that we do not just end up with a  smaller\r\n\r\ncurriculum  load, but one that retains this rigour.   How\r\n\r\nfar  should we go?  The report says that from  330  hours\r\n\r\ncurrently  per  subject, let us move down to  270  hours.\r\n\r\nThere  is no magic in the number.   But it is  a sensible\r\n\r\nobjective.   It  is  higher than what  the  International\r\n\r\nBaccalaureate  would  have for a typical  subject,  or  a\r\n\r\ntypical US High School subject, but that is because\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey take more courses.  They have a broader curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What perhaps is more important is the total amount\r\n\r\nof  curriculum hours, and some Members have  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  we  may not be going far enough.  We are  expecting\r\n\r\nthat  total curriculum hours over the two years  will  be\r\n\r\nbetween  1,300 and 1,700.  For the top end, for  students\r\n\r\nwho are currently doing four 'A' levels, particularly  in\r\n\r\nScience subjects, there is a significant reduction.   For\r\n\r\nthose  who  are doing just  three 'A' levels, there  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  much reduction under this proposed system.   But\r\n\r\n1,300 hours for these students is not an overstretch.  It\r\n\r\nis  not an overload.  It is not significantly higher than\r\n\r\nwhat   exists   in   the   UK,   or   the   International\r\n\r\nBaccalaureate.  And if you speak to some educationists in\r\n\r\nthe  UK, they will tell you that their students are still\r\n\r\nunder-stretched, and they are concerned about it.  In the\r\n\r\nUS, although the minimum you will find in High School  is\r\n\r\ntypically between 1,300 and 1,400 hours, most of the best\r\n\r\nschools  have a curriculum that is between the  range  of\r\n\r\n1,500  and  1,700, not very different from  what  we  are\r\n\r\nproposing.  So although Dr Wang Kai Yuen noted  that  our\r\n\r\nproposal of 1,300-1,700 hours was higher than the  US,  I\r\n\r\nshould   clarify   that  that  refers  to   the   minimum\r\n\r\nrequirement in the US, rather than what the best  schools\r\n\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reduction, as I said, will be for students\r\n\r\nwho  take   more  subjects.  For them, they  will  see  a\r\n\r\nsignificant reduction in curriculum time.  For those  who\r\n\r\ntake just three 'A's, they will not see much reduction or\r\n\r\nany  reduction  at all.  But the problem is  not  one  of\r\n\r\noverload of the curriculum for students taking three A's.\r\n\r\nSome  of  them  may  find problems  with  the  curriculum\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is an intellectually challenging curriculum.\r\n\r\nBut it is not one of curriculum overload as such.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran is right that this is all about the front-end of curriculum time, and not what happens at the back-end or outside the formal curriculum - self-study,\r\n\r\nresearch,  and  a lot of things students  do  to  try  to\r\n\r\nimprove their performance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  how well they will do in their examinations.   There\r\n\r\nis  not very much we can do directly to reshape how  much\r\n\r\nstudents do outside of the curriculum, outside of what is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  And we are not unique in that respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a competitive system where parents and\r\n\r\nstudents  see education as a path to future success.   We\r\n\r\nare   still  a  society  in  momentum,  where  no   one's\r\n\r\nbackground  pulls him back from a better future.   Social\r\n\r\nmobility  is still there in the system, and that  is  the\r\n\r\nsource of competition.  And we have equipped students  to\r\n\r\ncompete, much better than we have done in the past  -  to\r\n\r\ncompete  at increasingly higher levels - so that at  each\r\n\r\nlevel  that you look at, there are far more students  now\r\n\r\ncompeting to get ahead than  used to be in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look around East Asia, we will find exactly\r\n\r\nthe  same  phenomenon.  If we look at China,  Taiwan  and\r\n\r\nKorea, I would say there is more stress, more overload in\r\n\r\nthe  system.   These are the reports we  get.   Singapore\r\n\r\nexpatriates who send their children to  schools in  China\r\n\r\nor Taiwan tell us it is  more stressful.  In Korea, there\r\n\r\nis  a  saying  that they drum into kids at a  young  age,\r\n\r\n`Sleep   five  hours,  fail.  Sleep  four  hours,  pass'.\r\n\r\nRichard  Lim,  who runs Majullah Connection  in  the  US,\r\n\r\ntold  me  recently over the email that he was talking  to\r\n\r\nsome   students  from  China who had the  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nstudying  in  Singapore along the way, who  spent  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  studying  in  Singapore. They told  him  that  our\r\n\r\nSingapore  system struck them as being much more  rounded\r\n\r\nthan the system that they had gone through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we have a problem, but let us look at it in\r\n\r\nperspective.  This is in large part a social  phenomenon,\r\n\r\nnot  an  educational  one, and it  is  in  large  part  a\r\n\r\npositive  phenomenon  of  a  society  that  is  still  in\r\n\r\nmomentum.  Our students probably work too hard  at  their\r\n\r\nexaminations.  I agree with that.  And our parents should\r\n\r\nset  more realistic expectations for their kids.  But the\r\n\r\nsolutions are not obvious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taiwan attempted to change the situation two years\r\n\r\nago.  They had a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommission  that  was  set up  in  1996,  that  was  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  rote-like preparation for  examinations\r\n\r\nand  the  stress in the system.  They devised  what  they\r\n\r\ncalled  a  multi-path education system.   Admission  into\r\n\r\nsenior  middle school from junior middle school  will  no\r\n\r\nlonger be determined by a common examination, but will be\r\n\r\ndetermined  by recommendations by the school,  interviews\r\n\r\nand   the  candidate's  own  proposals  for  his   future\r\n\r\neducation - a range of criteria will be used.  Similarly,\r\n\r\na quarter of the places in colleges for those from senior\r\n\r\nmiddle   schools   are  now  to  be  reserved  for   this\r\n\r\nqualitative means of entry - -  -  instead of by   common\r\n\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, two years later, surveys are being done of\r\n\r\nparents  and  teachers to see how they  feel  about  this\r\n\r\nsystem that was aimed to relieve examination stress.  The\r\n\r\nresult - situation more stressful.  Parents and teachers,\r\n\r\nthe  majority  are saying that students are more  unhappy\r\n\r\nnow.    Students  are   stressed out by  having  to  take\r\n\r\ninterviews,  write applications to different schools  and\r\n\r\nwrite  proposals about their future education.  Many  are\r\n\r\nnow   calling   for  a  return  to  a  universal   common\r\n\r\nexamination,  with  all the stress and  unintended  side-effects that that will entail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan tried - Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee went into\r\n\r\nthis  at  some length - a very interesting experiment  by\r\n\r\ncutting down on content, seeking to reduce the stress  in\r\n\r\nthe  examination system.  Prof. Koo has covered  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  unintended  effects of what was  done,  eg,  reduced\r\n\r\nrigour, reduced depth of learning in key core areas,  but\r\n\r\nthere  was another interesting side-effect. Not only  did\r\n\r\nthe  students need to study less hard, but they are  also\r\n\r\nless interested in their studies, and less interested  in\r\n\r\neach  other and in society.  So, there has been a general\r\n\r\ndecline  in intensity of education, not just with  regard\r\n\r\nto  examinations, but  intensity of education in all  its\r\n\r\naspects.  There is  reduced interest in  education  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was speaking last week to the Chairman of Fuji\r\n\r\nXerox, Mr Yutaro\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nKobayashi, an eminent Japanese industrialist, and he said\r\n\r\nthat this is now of great concern to Japanese businesses,\r\n\r\nie,  the  fact  that  students are  not  taking  learning\r\n\r\nseriously  and  they are not interested  in  each  other.\r\n\r\nThey  are not interested in society.  It is not a problem\r\n\r\nfor  the  top  end,  the top 20%.  If you  cut  down  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  they just spend more time  in  private  juku\r\n\r\nschools and, in fact, that has been happening.  They  are\r\n\r\nadvantaged because their parents know what they  have  to\r\n\r\ndo  to  get ahead in life.  But there has been a widening\r\n\r\ndispersion   between  the  top-end  and  the   bottom-end\r\n\r\nprecisely because education has become less intense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, one merit of our system - where we put it all in\r\n\r\nthe  education  system, ensure that every  student  works\r\n\r\nhard  within the system and aims high - is that  it  also\r\n\r\nreduces  this dispersion that comes about when you  leave\r\n\r\nit to market forces to determine which parents urge their\r\n\r\nchildren to take studies  seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to shift focus, shift balance, encourage non-academic pursuits and encourage students to take a\r\n\r\nsubject  which they are interested in to as far  as  they\r\n\r\ncan  go  and have a passion in it.  But let us  keep  the\r\n\r\noverall  intensity in place.  Let us change what students\r\n\r\ndo  within  education, but not reduce  the  intensity  as\r\n\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examinations and teaching methods are clearly\r\n\r\ncritical.  We will continue to change the nature  of  the\r\n\r\nexamination system.  It is an evolutionary process, not a\r\n\r\nsudden one-off break.  We are attempting to place greater\r\n\r\nemphasis   on  testing  the  understanding  of  concepts,\r\n\r\nstudents'  ability  to  reason and  to  evaluate  subject\r\n\r\nmatter  critically,  ie, greater  emphasis  on  students'\r\n\r\nability  to apply what they have learnt, rather  than  to\r\n\r\nreproduce what they have learnt.  It is being done across\r\n\r\na  range of subjects - eg, in literature, history and  in\r\n\r\nthe  science subjects.  In science, for instance, we  are\r\n\r\nmoving   towards   a   school-based   science   practical\r\n\r\nassessment,  ie,  a  form of continuous  assessment  that\r\n\r\nlooks  at students' laboratory investigation skills,  the\r\n\r\nability to design\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexperiments,  as  distinct  from  a  one-off  end-of-year\r\n\r\nscience laboratory test.  This process will continue, and\r\n\r\nit is important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a perception on the part of many hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  that some subjects are easier to score  in  than\r\n\r\nothers.   Dr  John Chen and a few others  have  mentioned\r\n\r\nthat literature seems harder to score in and that is  why\r\n\r\nstudents  shun  it.  I think it is not a situation  where\r\n\r\nsome subjects are easier to score in than others, but the\r\n\r\nfact  that  Singaporean students  are  stronger  in  some\r\n\r\nsubjects  than in others.   All over the world,  students\r\n\r\ntake  subjects that they are strong in.  In  the  UK,  in\r\n\r\nfact, preferences are exactly the reverse.  Students shun\r\n\r\nscience  and  mathematics  because  they  think   it   is\r\n\r\ndifficult.  So, there is nothing wrong in taking subjects\r\n\r\nthat  you are strong in.  We must want to make sure  that\r\n\r\nyou do not over-specialise and that you have some breadth\r\n\r\nof learning, particularly while you are in school and JC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the data on literature. We have to look\r\n\r\nat  the data quite carefully.  If we look at students  of\r\n\r\nthe  same  ability group, we will not find a big  gap  in\r\n\r\nperformance  in literature and the other  subjects.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, if we look at schools like RI and RGS, we get a\r\n\r\nhigher   proportion  of  students  who  take   literature\r\n\r\nobtaining  distinctions, compared to  the  proportion  of\r\n\r\nstudents    taking   chemistry   or   biology   obtaining\r\n\r\ndistinctions.Any student who has an interest and  passion\r\n\r\nin a subject will be able to do well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Ms Braema Mathiaparanam raised\r\n\r\nthe issue of the university admission system, whether  we\r\n\r\nshould  give greater weight to CCA, project work, and  so\r\n\r\non.  The  entire university admission framework would  be\r\n\r\nstudied  carefully.    Dr Ng Eng Hen chairs  a  committee\r\n\r\nthat  is  looking at this, and we will have to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat the intent of the new JC curriculum is reflected  in\r\n\r\nthe new JC admission system.  We should  move away from a\r\n\r\nsingle  formula for university admission, and  we  should\r\n\r\nmove  towards a system where each university evolves  its\r\n\r\nown   system  of  admission  and  perhaps,  even   across\r\n\r\nfaculties, different criteria will be taken into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the challenges faced by our teaching force\r\n\r\nare  going to be central to this whole exercise.  We will\r\n\r\nput more teaching resources into our junior colleges,  so\r\n\r\nthat they can confidently deal with this broader and more\r\n\r\nflexible   curriculum.   There  are  some  specific   new\r\n\r\nrequirements.   Knowledge and Inquiry is a  new  subject.\r\n\r\nIt  will require a new set of skills and we will probably\r\n\r\ntrain  new  teachers  as well as some   of  our  existing\r\n\r\nteachers.  We  may even import a few foreign expatriates.\r\n\r\nFor  instance,  those with experience in  the  IB  system\r\n\r\nwhere  they have a Theory of  Knowledge subject, we might\r\n\r\nimport a few of them to help us out in the initial years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be working closely with the NIE to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  teachers develop a broader repertoire  of  teaching\r\n\r\napproaches,  and we will be retraining our existing  pool\r\n\r\nof  teachers.   But  none of these  is  new.   It  is  an\r\n\r\nevolutionary process.  We are not shifting from one  mode\r\n\r\nto a completely new mode of teaching or learning.  So,  I\r\n\r\nam uncomfortable with some of the references to having to\r\n\r\n\"remake\"  our  teachers or \"remake\" Singapore's  teaching\r\n\r\nforce.   They  are  not  as  rigidly  captured  by  their\r\n\r\nbackground  as  we  make them out to be.   In  fact,  the\r\n\r\ndistinctive about the Singapore teaching force  has  been\r\n\r\nits willingness to change, particularly if you compare it\r\n\r\nto  teaching  forces  elsewhere.  If  you  look  at  some\r\n\r\ncountries  where  they  attempted to  introduce  IT  into\r\n\r\neducation,   they  ran  into  many  teachers   who   were\r\n\r\npassionately  against change.  We have very few  teachers\r\n\r\nwho  are  passionately against change, and we  have  many\r\n\r\nteachers  who are passionate about change.  This  is  our\r\n\r\nstrength.   It  is a strength of our system.   So,  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  confident  that  if we size  up  the  requirements\r\n\r\ncarefully,  put  resources and energy into  training  our\r\n\r\nteachers, they will respond well and respond confidently.\r\n\r\nLet us not caricature the teaching force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A diverse education landscape is the second major\r\n\r\nlimb of the White Paper, and I will not be as long in  my\r\n\r\nresponses  on  this issue.  The key issue that  has  been\r\n\r\nraised has been whether we are building elitism into  the\r\n\r\nsystem by introducing the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIntegrated Programme schools, and I think this is a valid\r\n\r\nissue.   The  Minister  for  Education,  RAdm  Teo,   has\r\n\r\naddressed this substantively in his opening remarks.   My\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Minister of State for Education,  Dr  Ng  Eng\r\n\r\nHen,  has  spoken  yesterday  about  the  resources   and\r\n\r\nenergies that go into ensuring that all our students  are\r\n\r\nequipped to go as far as they can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add a further perspective on this. We all\r\n\r\naccept that we need to have a more differentiated system.\r\n\r\nIt  is necessary to spur innovation, including innovation\r\n\r\nin  education  itself,  and  it  is  necessary  to  groom\r\n\r\ndiverse  talents.  The question is how we do it.   Do  we\r\n\r\nhave greater differentiation within the mainstream of the\r\n\r\nstate  education  system, or do we have  it  outside  the\r\n\r\nmainstream?  That is the key question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are almost unique internationally in attempting\r\n\r\nto   bring   differentiation  and  diversity   into   the\r\n\r\nmainstream, with the principle of meritocracy  continuing\r\n\r\nto  apply,  so  that everyone with the determination  and\r\n\r\nability  can  benefit.   Affordability  will  not  be   a\r\n\r\ncriterion  for  taking  any of  these  diverse  paths  in\r\n\r\neducation.  So, this is what distinguishes us from  other\r\n\r\ncountries that have differentiated systems,  that we  are\r\n\r\nproviding  differentiation  within  the  system.  We  are\r\n\r\nkeeping education relevant for the future while  ensuring\r\n\r\nit  remains a social leveller, as Mdm Halimah put  it,  a\r\n\r\ntool  for  social mobility,  with equal access  based  on\r\n\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look around the world - and many countries\r\n\r\nhave  now  moved  towards highly differentiated  systems,\r\n\r\nsome very innovative ones - we will find that, generally,\r\n\r\nthe  differentiation  takes  place  outside  the  system,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the failure of the state school system.   So,\r\n\r\nthere  may be an  egalitarian posture in  public  debates\r\n\r\nin  the  UK, US and elsewhere, but it obscures a thriving\r\n\r\nprivate  school system, which is where the  bulk  of  the\r\n\r\ninnovation  takes place in their education systems.   The\r\n\r\nUK  had   a big furore about equality of access to  their\r\n\r\npublic schools.  They got rid\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  their  grammar  schools, got rid of  the  ability  of\r\n\r\nschools    to    select   by   merit,   and    introduced\r\n\r\ncomprehensives.  But  very little was  being  said  about\r\n\r\ntheir  thriving \"public school\" system or what are really\r\n\r\nprivate  independent  schools  where  parents  with   the\r\n\r\nresources  and  the  motivation  send  their   kids   to,\r\n\r\nincluding even  many of those who were  themselves  arch-advocates of the changes in the state school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, private schools are at the pinnacle of\r\n\r\nthe system.  The US probably has some of the best schools\r\n\r\ninternationally, but they are private, expensive, and you\r\n\r\nhave  to be able to afford their fees.  Except for a  few\r\n\r\nspecialised   public  schools,  the  Bronx   Highs    and\r\n\r\nStuyvesants,  most public schools are  unable  to  select\r\n\r\nstudents  on  merit.  They select students  according  to\r\n\r\nwhere  they  live. Admission to school is  determined  by\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.  I was recently told by a principal  of  a\r\n\r\npublic school in the Bay area of the US that there  is  a\r\n\r\nsaying  amongst  the  principals  that  the  higher   the\r\n\r\naltitude of the school, the better the performance of the\r\n\r\nschool.  Because schools that are in the higher altitudes\r\n\r\nare in the better neighbourhoods where the professionals,\r\n\r\nscientists and engineers  stay.  And because they have  a\r\n\r\nsystem where the local community funds a fair bit of  the\r\n\r\nexpenditures  of  the school, especially  its  enrichment\r\n\r\nprogrammes, it is really a system of social elitism, even\r\n\r\nin public school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan, a very egalitarian society, has had a\r\n\r\nthriving private education system, from pre-school up  to\r\n\r\nuniversity,  for many decades now.  It is so  competitive\r\n\r\nthat  to  get  into the system, parents have  to  subject\r\n\r\nthemselves to interviews to get their kids into the elite\r\n\r\nprivate  pre-schools.   And the system flows all the  way\r\n\r\nup. Once you are into the right nursery, you get into the\r\n\r\nright primary school, the right secondary school and  all\r\n\r\nthe way up.  It is a very egalitarian society but that is\r\n\r\nthe  way in which they have accommodated differentiation.\r\n\r\nAnd we are choosing a different path.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few advanced countries that still\r\n\r\nhave a largely public school\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem.  Some of the European countries have it - Holland\r\n\r\nand  Sweden.   And  there too, they  have  differentiated\r\n\r\ntheir  system.  In Sweden, in the upper secondary  school\r\n\r\nsystem, they have 14 different programmes, of which  only\r\n\r\nthree  are  geared towards eventual university admission.\r\n\r\nIn  Holland, they have four quite distinct streams.   But\r\n\r\nbecause they stream their students relatively late,  many\r\n\r\nof  their  weaker  students  are  not  well-equipped  for\r\n\r\ncontinuous learning and not well-trained in core  skills.\r\n\r\nToday's Straits Times has an article on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even China has no compunction in creating special\r\n\r\npaths  for  different  talents, be it  academic  talents,\r\n\r\nmusical  talents,  gymnastic  talents.   They  have  many\r\n\r\nexperimental schools now which go much further than  what\r\n\r\nwe are proposing in our Report. Take for instance Beijing\r\n\r\nJingshan School, one of their experimental schools,  from\r\n\r\nprimary  school  all  the way up  to  senior  middle.  It\r\n\r\nprovides  a  through-train for  all  its  primary  school\r\n\r\nstudents  to go on to junior middle school. And  the  top\r\n\r\njunior middle students, the top 10% or so, are provided a\r\n\r\nthrough-train to go on to senior middle.  If you look  at\r\n\r\nsome of their other experimental schools, they provide  a\r\n\r\nthrough-train  for  the  top  students  in  Science   and\r\n\r\nMathematics to the top universities.  Again, we  are  not\r\n\r\nproposing  this,  but I raise this as an illustration  of\r\n\r\nhow  even  China,  a relatively egalitarian  society,  is\r\n\r\nproviding  these differentiated paths and  not  shrinking\r\n\r\nfrom  it.  Because they know that in the  knowledge-based\r\n\r\nenvironment of the future, they need outstanding talents.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the  basic  point.  We  need  more  outstanding\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in all fields - Science, Mathematics,  law,\r\n\r\ndiplomacy, arts. We need more outstanding Singaporeans to\r\n\r\ntake  us  forward.  We need to groom them as best  as  we\r\n\r\ncan,  nurture  a spirit of Singaporeanness  in  them  and\r\n\r\nmaximise  their  contributions to society.   So,  let  us\r\n\r\nbuild  this  diversity into the mainstream  and  seek  to\r\n\r\ncontain social elitism as we do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Integrated Programme schools will actually offer\r\n\r\nus  more  opportunities to guard against  social  elitism\r\n\r\nthan our existing school system does.  They will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  more time.  If you look at the proposals that  have\r\n\r\nbeen put forward by the schools that are applying to  run\r\n\r\nthe Integrated Programmes, they indeed intend to spend  a\r\n\r\nlot more time on developing leadership and commitment  to\r\n\r\nthe  community.   So,  this  is  not  a  change  that  is\r\n\r\nintrinsically going to lead to a more elitist system.  If\r\n\r\nanything, it offers  an opportunity for the top  academic\r\n\r\ntalents  to develop stronger instincts of Singaporeanness\r\n\r\nand commitment to their fellow citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should clarify, because a question was asked about\r\n\r\nthe  GEP programme, that we see this also among  the  GEP\r\n\r\nstudents.   We have done a longitudinal tracking  of  our\r\n\r\nGEP  students,  although they are still quite  young;   I\r\n\r\nthink the first batch is only 30 years old.  A far higher\r\n\r\nproportion of GEP students do community service  compared\r\n\r\nto the population average for their cohort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked the question of whether\r\n\r\nwe  should extend the Integrated Programme beyond the top\r\n\r\n10%. Again, I must say that there was no magic in the 10%\r\n\r\nnumber.  It was a matter of judgment, because we have  to\r\n\r\ndecide which students the Integrated Programme was  going\r\n\r\nto be suitable for.  It does not suit all JC students and\r\n\r\nwe  have to accept that.  Some students will be confident\r\n\r\nof  doing  well  in  their \"A\" levels and  proceeding  to\r\n\r\nuniversity  and getting into a faculty of  their  choice.\r\n\r\nAnd  others  will  be  a  little  less  confident.   Some\r\n\r\nstudents would relish an unstructured environment in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle of their secondary school years, and others  would\r\n\r\nprefer  a  more structured environment. And many  of  the\r\n\r\nparents  would  prefer a more structured environment,  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure he gets the \"O\" levels in hand before he  goes\r\n\r\non to the \"A\" levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be realistic about this. In fact, Mr Ang\r\n\r\nMong  Seng  and  Mr  Zainudin have  themselves  expressed\r\n\r\nconcern  about  whether some of the Integrated  Programme\r\n\r\nstudents  will not do so well, and about  what will  they\r\n\r\nend  up  with.  I think we will minimise the risk  of  IP\r\n\r\nstudents  not doing well if we are stringent in selection\r\n\r\nof students into the IP schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThat is the main policy strategy - make sure that we  are\r\n\r\nselective and do not just channel people into IP  because\r\n\r\nit  sounds  like  a  better path to education.   We  have\r\n\r\nlooked  at  the data.  If we look at the top 5%  of  PSLE\r\n\r\ncohort,  92% of them eventually do well enough to qualify\r\n\r\nfor  our  local  universities.  If we go  to  the  6-10th\r\n\r\npercentile,  it  already begins to drop  significantly  - only 86% of them qualify for our local universities.  So,\r\n\r\nwe have to be realistic.  If we go beyond 10%, I think we\r\n\r\nwill  have a higher rate of error, and we will face  more\r\n\r\nof the problems which Mr Ang Mong Seng was talking about,\r\n\r\nof  students who go in quite confident but end up not  so\r\n\r\nconfident, because they have not done so well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Integrated Programme schools will themselves be\r\n\r\nin  the  best position to assess suitability.  Once  they\r\n\r\nhave  taken  in their pupils, they will be  in  the  best\r\n\r\nposition  to assess in the first couple of years  who  is\r\n\r\nreally  suitable to stay on the Integrated Programme  and\r\n\r\nwho  should, in fact, opt for the \"O\" levels. Some,  like\r\n\r\nACS, are proposing to offer both the Integrated Programme\r\n\r\nand  the \"O\" level stream, so that students will be  able\r\n\r\nto switch. But RI has said that  within a matter of a few\r\n\r\nyears  it  is  going  to be  a pure Integrated  Programme\r\n\r\nschool.   So, if you want to switch, you move to  another\r\n\r\nmainstream school. I think that is a reasonable scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki, Mr Zainul, Ms Braema and a few others\r\n\r\nhave raised the issue of what can be done to improve  our\r\n\r\n3-year  pre-university programme.   It  is  an  important\r\n\r\nissue.   I must tell Members that we deliberated at  some\r\n\r\nlength   in  the  Review  Committee  on  the   issue   of\r\n\r\nCentralised Institutes, because one perspective  is  that\r\n\r\nwe should not actually provide for them within the system\r\n\r\nbut  let  private  schools take care of them.  These  are\r\n\r\nstudents  who  typically could not  get  into  the  right\r\n\r\nfaculty in polytechnics and also cannot make it to junior\r\n\r\ncollege  -  why not let the private sector take  care  of\r\n\r\nthem?   We  decided  against it.   We  decided  that  the\r\n\r\nCentralised  Institutes should remain part of  the  state\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tharman, you have got about five\r\n\r\nminutes of streaming time left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Yes, thank you. Every\r\n\r\nstudent benefits from a state subsidy for 12-13 years  of\r\n\r\neducation and from the resources and quality improvements\r\n\r\nthat we keep putting into the system.  We want to see the\r\n\r\nCentralised  Institutes (CIs) not just as a  residual  of\r\n\r\nthe  system but as a quality component in its own  right.\r\n\r\nMOE   has  been  discussing  this  with  the  Centralised\r\n\r\nInstitutes to see how we can improve their programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked a question of what would\r\n\r\nhappen  to the Gifted Education Programme (GEP) with  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the Integrated Programme.   The  Gifted\r\n\r\nEducation Programme will have to be restructured  at  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  level with the introduction of the  Integrated\r\n\r\nProgramme schools.  Four of the existing Gifted Education\r\n\r\nsecondary  centres - RI, RGS, Chinese  High  School,  ACS\r\n\r\nIndependent  - have applied to the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nto   run  Integrated  Programmes.   If  their  Integrated\r\n\r\nProgrammes are approved, as I expect they will, three  of\r\n\r\nthese  schools  - RI, RGS and the Chinese High  School  - will  cease to be Gifted Education Centres and will offer\r\n\r\nthe  Integrated Programme only.  Under ACS  Independent's\r\n\r\nproposal,  it  is  somewhat different because  they  will\r\n\r\ndecide  on  Integrated  Programme students  at  Secondary\r\n\r\nThree  rather than Secondary One.  So they will  continue\r\n\r\nto  run a Gifted Programme.  For students who do not  end\r\n\r\nup  on the Integrated Programme, they can continue to  be\r\n\r\nin  the  Gifted Programme while pursing their \"O\" levels.\r\n\r\nGifted  Education  pupils who opt to join  an  Integrated\r\n\r\nProgramme  that  does  not  offer  the  GE  Programme  at\r\n\r\nsecondary  level  will compete, like all other  students,\r\n\r\nfor  places  in  Integrated Programme schools;  in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  RI,  RGS,  Chinese High, based on  the  admission\r\n\r\ncriteria  of  those schools.  And pupils who  join  those\r\n\r\nschools,  who  have  come from the  Gifted  Programme  at\r\n\r\nprimary school, will join those schools as part of  their\r\n\r\nmainstream  classes. What the IP schools will  do  is  to\r\n\r\napply some of the techniques and programmes of the Gifted\r\n\r\nProgramme across the board to all their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclasses.  The Gifted Education Branch at MOE will support\r\n\r\nthem  in  doing  so.  We will continue to offer  funding,\r\n\r\nsupport, advice on the design of such programmes and  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  that  is  best suited  to  the  top  band  of\r\n\r\nstudents.   They will still need to have some  programmes\r\n\r\nthat  are specific to the very top end of students.   But\r\n\r\nwe  should  have some flexibility in this and  allow  the\r\n\r\nschools  to shape programmes that best meet the needs  of\r\n\r\ntheir pupils.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have the Integrated Programme schools in\r\n\r\nplace,  MOE will discontinue the supplementary  selection\r\n\r\nexercise   for   admission  into  the  Gifted   Education\r\n\r\nProgramme   at  Secondary  One.  This  is   because   the\r\n\r\nIntegrated  Programme  schools  and  the  new  specialist\r\n\r\nMathematics  and Science School, once it is formed,  will\r\n\r\nopen up opportunities for more pupils who are not already\r\n\r\npart  of  the primary school Gifted Education  Programme.\r\n\r\nSo,  there  will  be ample opportunities  to  join  these\r\n\r\nschools and there is no need for a supplementary exercise\r\n\r\nto  select students for the Gifted Programme at secondary\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cedric Foo and a number of others have suggested\r\n\r\nthat  we should provide Government scholarships for needy\r\n\r\nstudents to attend private schools.  I do not think it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  or  desirable for us to do  that.  Anyone  who\r\n\r\nqualifies  for a place in our national schools, including\r\n\r\nour independent schools and any of our best schools, will\r\n\r\nnot  be  deprived  of  a  place on account  of  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   With diversity in place in  our  mainstream\r\n\r\nsystem  and with innovation and quality in place  in  our\r\n\r\nmainstream  system, there is really no  need  to  provide\r\n\r\nincentive or financial assistance for students to  go  to\r\n\r\nprivate schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On foreign system schools, some Members have\r\n\r\nquestioned whether we should ease up on some of the rules\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans to attend the foreign system schools  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Currently, MOE considers this  case-by-case.\r\n\r\nWe  will review the guidelines, particularly with respect\r\n\r\nto children of Singaporeans returning from abroad. But we\r\n\r\nshould\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbear   in  mind  that  the  international  schools   were\r\n\r\nestablished  for the purpose of catering to  children  of\r\n\r\nforeign  expatriates working in Singapore and  they  will\r\n\r\nhave  their  character  shaped  by  that  objective.  The\r\n\r\nchildren  in these schools will not experience  the  same\r\n\r\nsocial environment that our national schools provide, the\r\n\r\nenvironment that makes them uniquely Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, very quickly, the issue of whether\r\n\r\ndiversity  is  being restricted only  to  the  specialist\r\n\r\nschools  and Integrated Programme schools.  This  is  not\r\n\r\nthe case.  Diversity is not just for the top 10%.  It  is\r\n\r\nbeing spread throughout the system.  Look at our existing\r\n\r\nindependent   and  autonomous  schools.    We   have   23\r\n\r\nautonomous   schools  now.   19  of  them  have   already\r\n\r\nestablished  substantial niches  and  specialisations  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own in the arts, in sports, in Science, in special\r\n\r\nareas of learning.  Some of them, very recently, but some\r\n\r\nfor   several  years  now.   Look  at  our  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschools.  Through the cluster system that we have set  in\r\n\r\nplace,  our  neighbourhood schools now have available  to\r\n\r\nthem  the  opportunity to develop special  talents  in  a\r\n\r\nbroad  range  of areas.  Take arts. For example,  EastOne\r\n\r\nCluster  Art  Centre  at Siglap Secondary  School,  which\r\n\r\ncaters  not just to students at Siglap Secondary  but  to\r\n\r\nthe  whole  cluster.   It has three arts  galleries,  one\r\n\r\ngraphic  design centre, one ceramics room  and  one  arts\r\n\r\nresource  library. That is the hardware.  It has teachers\r\n\r\nwho    are   being  continually  trained,   and   sharing\r\n\r\nexperiences in how to engage students in the arts.   This\r\n\r\nis  something which is spreading throughout the system in\r\n\r\nour  neighbourhood schools.  Anyone with a special talent\r\n\r\nwill have an opportunity to develop it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are at a turning point. We have not painted\r\n\r\nan  end  destination, but I think we are confident  about\r\n\r\nthe  direction  that we are proceeding  in.   And  if  we\r\n\r\nimplement carefully,  ensure that our teachers  are  well\r\n\r\nprovided  with training, and keep them well motivated,  I\r\n\r\nam confident we will achieve our objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  after listening to the comprehensive speech by  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister  of State, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,  I\r\n\r\ncan  only  say that I rise to speak in strong support  of\r\n\r\nthe  motion  standing  in the name of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation.   Over 30 Members of this House  have  already\r\n\r\nexpressed  their views and Members present here  will  be\r\n\r\nrelieved  to know that this has considerably reduced  the\r\n\r\nlength of my speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I listened to the speakers, it struck me\r\n\r\nthat  the search for a perfect education policy is rather\r\n\r\nlike  searching for the Holy Grail.  It is unlikely  that\r\n\r\none  would  eventually find it, but  in  the  process  of\r\n\r\ntravelling  down the roads and the pathways, which  seems\r\n\r\nto  be the buzz word these days, we will be enriched and,\r\n\r\nin  some cases, even ennobled.  But, of course, some  may\r\n\r\nstumble  and fall but the quest goes on.  In this  House,\r\n\r\nfor the last couple of days, we have been embarking on  a\r\n\r\njourney  to  search  for a better  education  system  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, first, I think that our educators deserves\r\n\r\ncredit  for  the  many  achievements  of  past  education\r\n\r\npolicies.   These  policies  have  enabled  Singapore  to\r\n\r\npropel itself to first world status within three decades.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  owe a debt of gratitude to educators,  past\r\n\r\nand  present.  As a parent of two children who have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough the system, I for one would like to say thank you\r\n\r\nto them for providing my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchildren  with  an  education  that  is  hard  to   beat,\r\n\r\nespecially if one were to consider the costs of providing\r\n\r\nfor  such  an  education.  I am one of those parents  who\r\n\r\naccept  that  stress  is a necessary  part  of  life  and\r\n\r\neducation,  and  that  the  development  of  intellectual\r\n\r\nrigour  is  of  utmost  importance in  the  education  of\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading Command Paper No. 8, I searched, first, for\r\n\r\nthe  vision that must ex hypothesi be different from  the\r\n\r\none that had held good for nearly three decades.  The old\r\n\r\nvision,  if  one  can  call it that,  was  one  that  was\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  produce  \"high  levels  of  achievement  by\r\n\r\ninternational   comparison,   and   prepared   successive\r\n\r\ngenerations  well  for  the  workplace,  citizenship  and\r\n\r\nresponsible adulthood.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new vision is stated in paragraph 26 of the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Going forward, we face the challenge of preparing\r\n\r\nstudents  for a future of innovation-driven  growth,  and\r\n\r\nfrequent  and  unpredictable changes in the economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial  environment..  The focus of education must  shift\r\n\r\nfrom  efficiency to diversity, from knowing to  thinking,\r\n\r\nand  from  fitting people to specific jobs  to  equipping\r\n\r\nthem  for  lifelong  learning  and  creating  their   own\r\n\r\nopportunities.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNice, eloquent phrases.  But how true is this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a bold vision, a borrowed vision or a\r\n\r\nblurred  vision?  As I understand it, the old vision  had\r\n\r\nto  do with educating our students for specific jobs, and\r\n\r\nfor  training  them  to work efficiently.   Emphasis  was\r\n\r\nplaced on knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new vision, in a world subjected to the\r\n\r\ndemands  of  globalisation and the knowledge economy,  we\r\n\r\nshould provide our students with a diversified education,\r\n\r\nwith  thinking skills rather than knowledge and with  the\r\n\r\nability   to  be  extremely  mobile,  and  to  re-educate\r\n\r\nthemselves,   if   need   be,   when   their   employment\r\n\r\ncircumstances change.  This is the new vision.   If  this\r\n\r\ncan  be achieved, I think the Minister for Manpower would\r\n\r\nno  longer  need to worry about structural  unemployment,\r\n\r\nbecause workers will re-educate themselves for new  jobs.\r\n\r\nAnd that would be a wonderful scenario, which would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake  a lot of sense in the current circumstances,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vision assumes that developing thinking\r\n\r\nskills  and  acquiring greater breadth of learning  would\r\n\r\nmeet the needs of the knowledge economy.  The White Paper\r\n\r\nstates that \"in the knowledge economy, an ability to draw\r\n\r\non  different disciplines will be at a premium.\"  Sir, my\r\n\r\nfirst query really is:  how true is this?  Will depth  of\r\n\r\nlearning  be sacrificed for the breadth of learning?   As\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam,  has\r\n\r\nfully  addressed this point, even though this is  not  an\r\n\r\nunimportant question  -  and he had said so himself  -  I\r\n\r\nthink that his answers more than satisfactorily cover the\r\n\r\npoints  that  I  want to make about the  fact  that  even\r\n\r\nthough  we broaden the curriculum, it will not be at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  the shallowness of learning.  And  I  assume\r\n\r\nthat  this will be very important when the new curriculum\r\n\r\ntakes effect.  But I think parents and their children may\r\n\r\nstill  be  at  a  loss  as  to  how  to  deal  with  this\r\n\r\ninterdisciplinary   approach.   They   ask   simple   and\r\n\r\nimmediate   questions,  such  as  what  would   the   new\r\n\r\ncurriculum mean in terms of the chances for my  children,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  to  secure a place in the  university,  in\r\n\r\nmedical school, in engineering or in accountancy or  law.\r\n\r\nDiversity  in curriculum may bring uncertainty  and  even\r\n\r\nunhappiness to many, particularly in the years that  such\r\n\r\na  new curriculum start because not many people would  be\r\n\r\nsure as to how it would go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I am all for the diversity in the\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   I  hope  that there will  be  some  serious\r\n\r\nattention  given  to  working out exactly  what  sort  of\r\n\r\nworkers  are  needed  in a knowledge-based  economy.   We\r\n\r\npride ourselves in the past for providing education  that\r\n\r\nwould  fit our people into different jobs.  And  a  large\r\n\r\npart of that success has been due to manpower projections\r\n\r\nabout  how  many  engineers, how many doctors,  how  many\r\n\r\nlawyers, how many accountants are needed.  How will  such\r\n\r\nprojections now work in the age of uncertainty?  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  question  needs  to be addressed  and,  so  far,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  has  not been quite addressed  by  the  answers\r\n\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn next to a problem already referred to by\r\n\r\nsome  Members  of this House, namely, resources.   It  is\r\n\r\ntrue  to  say  that  when we shift the balance  from  the\r\n\r\nacquisition of knowledge to the acquisition of analytical\r\n\r\nor communication skills, we are talking of a very serious\r\n\r\nincrease  in the number and quality of teachers of  these\r\n\r\nskills.   As  we  found  out  in  teaching  advocacy  and\r\n\r\nlawyering skills in the Law Faculty, staff-student ratios\r\n\r\nhave  to be drastically reduced in order for such  skills\r\n\r\nto  be taught effectively, because the emphasis would  be\r\n\r\non  each  individual student and his or  her  ability  to\r\n\r\nanalyse and communicate.  We found out, for example, that\r\n\r\na   staff-student  ratio  of  1:8  would  be  just  about\r\n\r\nmanageable.  Do we intend to increase staff resources  to\r\n\r\nthat  level?   Can  we train sufficient teachers  in  the\r\n\r\nshort  space  of time available in such skills,  and  not\r\n\r\nonly  in  such  skills but in imparting  such  skills  to\r\n\r\nhundreds or even thousands of JC and secondary students?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasise the words of the\r\n\r\nmotion that \"the curriculum will better develop thinking,\r\n\r\ncommunication and other process skills .\"   Whether  this\r\n\r\nwill  actually achieve the result or not depends  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch  on  the curriculum per se, which only provides  the\r\n\r\nopportunity for the acquiring of such skills, but on  the\r\n\r\nteachers  and  the  time given to the  training  of  such\r\n\r\nskills to their charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not to say that the new vision and\r\n\r\napproach  does not promise much.  It does.  It  has  many\r\n\r\ngood  elements  in  it.  The development  of  independent\r\n\r\nthinking,  teamwork spirit and social  consciousness  are\r\n\r\ncritical objectives.  They are worth developing for their\r\n\r\nown  sake.   It  seems, however, that a balance  must  be\r\n\r\nstruck,  and  the  Senior Minister of State  Tharman  has\r\n\r\naddressed some of the problems.  A balance must be struck\r\n\r\nbetween  knowledge and skills - which  he  has  addressed\r\n\r\nvery  thoroughly - diversity and specialisation, teamwork\r\n\r\nand  individual development.  Working out these  balances\r\n\r\nwill take time, and as he so properly pointed out, if the\r\n\r\nbalance is properly addressed and worked out, it will  be\r\n\r\na  system  that  the world has never seen before,  and  I\r\n\r\ndoubt if any other country\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  lay  claim to having worked out such a  system.   So\r\n\r\ninstead  of a borrowed vision, Senior Minister  of  State\r\n\r\nTharman has convinced me that we can say that this  is  a\r\n\r\nbold vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if it is wrongly balanced, we would see an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  workload and stress, and  decrease  in  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of the programmes and a lack  of  focus  in\r\n\r\nthe  education  given  to students.   So,  of  course,  I\r\n\r\nsincerely hope that we will succeed in working  this  out\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supporting the motion, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nraise  a  problem  that  does  not  seem  to  have   been\r\n\r\nmentioned, and that is whether the implementation of  the\r\n\r\nnew  curriculum  would require not just  an  increase  in\r\n\r\nhuman  resources in terms of teachers and  trainers,  but\r\n\r\nalso   infrastructural  facilities,  such   as   language\r\n\r\nlaboratories,  recording studios, what have  you,  needed\r\n\r\nfor  the  teaching of communication skills and the  like.\r\n\r\nHas  the Ministry already got the plan in place to  build\r\n\r\nsuch  additional facilities in schools selected for  this\r\n\r\nnew curriculum?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to make the point about\r\n\r\ncompetition  among  colleges  and  schools,  the  ranking\r\n\r\nsystem in this new setup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranking of colleges according to their students'\r\n\r\nperformance  records,  and  the  like,  appears  to  have\r\n\r\ncreated  an atmosphere of competition among the  colleges\r\n\r\nand  schools.  However, what I would like to ask is:  has\r\n\r\nthis  so-called competition caused schools to lose  their\r\n\r\ncollegiality, their sense of cooperation with each other,\r\n\r\ntheir willingness to share resources and experiences with\r\n\r\neach other?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the diversified curriculum would impose a\r\n\r\ndemand  on  resources, the like of which has  never  been\r\n\r\nexperienced  before.   The new curriculum  will  bring  a\r\n\r\nperiod of uncertainty too for the schools.  There may  be\r\n\r\na  tendency to hoard expertise and experience rather than\r\n\r\nto  share  and  weld  a collegial spirit  among  all  our\r\n\r\ncolleges.   So I would like to ask what are  the  current\r\n\r\nmeasures and future\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeasures that are necessary to build up this collegiality\r\n\r\nin  the  schools and colleges that hitherto we  have  not\r\n\r\npromoted.  Sir, in the new age of diversity, we must  all\r\n\r\nthe  more  look for collegiality, among the  schools  and\r\n\r\ncolleges, among the teachers and students, and among  the\r\n\r\nstudents themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the diversification also in terms of private\r\n\r\nschools and public schools, we are entering into  an  era\r\n\r\nof what one might call an embarrassing richness of choice\r\n\r\nand  opportunity  for students compared to  the  relative\r\n\r\npoverty of choice under the old system.  I hope that  all\r\n\r\nin  this House will of course agree that we must make  it\r\n\r\nwork.   But  in order that the new curriculum  and  setup\r\n\r\nwill  work, educators and manpower planners must provide,\r\n\r\nI believe, more guidance and direction than that given in\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper.   Only  then  would  there  be  public\r\n\r\nconfidence that this sea-change of policy into  uncharted\r\n\r\nand uncertain waters will end up in a safe harbour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 - [Mr Mah Bow\r\n\r\nTan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JUNIOR COLLEGE/UPPER SECONDARY EDUCATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for giving me the opportunity to speak on the motion.\r\n\r\nI will go straight to the three areas of my concern and I\r\n\r\nwill make it short as all the points have been said,  and\r\n\r\nwell said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point one concerns the potential of the module-based\r\n\r\nJC curriculum for the lower and upper secondary education\r\n\r\nsystem.   I  commend  the Committee  led  by  Mr  Tharman\r\n\r\nShanmugaratnam, Senior Minister of State  for  Education,\r\n\r\nfor the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nintroduction of the module-based system for the provision\r\n\r\nof  breadth and depth of the subject contents of  the  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   It provides diversity and yet allows  depth\r\n\r\nof  knowledge.  I was so excited when I read this section\r\n\r\nof  the  report as I see the potential.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nurge  that  the module-based system be implemented  on  a\r\n\r\nwider  basis, from the lower secondary, and not  only  at\r\n\r\nthe  JC level.  With this implementation, the flexibility\r\n\r\nof the module-based system, we should try to do away with\r\n\r\nthe streaming of children at the secondary level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I was concerned recently of the ills of\r\n\r\nstreaming  and banding of the secondary school  children.\r\n\r\nI  was at a secondary school prize presentation ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhen  you  put the children together, you will  note  the\r\n\r\ndifference of the children's mannerism, eg, the sounds of\r\n\r\nthe  children's footsteps coming forward to  receive  the\r\n\r\nschool  awards  becoming  softer  and  softer,  from  the\r\n\r\nExpress student, to the Normal (Academic), to the  Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical)  stream  of  students.   This  difference  in\r\n\r\nboldness, and in confidence, was highlighted by  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  and  parents  after  the  ceremony,  which\r\n\r\nconfirmed my observation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I agree that the concept of streaming has\r\n\r\nvery  good  intention - to maximise our human talent  and\r\n\r\nresources - I believe what we did not anticipate was  the\r\n\r\nside-products of social stigma and the fear  of  failure.\r\n\r\nTo  allow  the  breadth and diversity  of  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem,  the  different  modules  of  subjects  could  be\r\n\r\ngrouped  into the various fields of studies,  and  within\r\n\r\nthe  fields, allow the depth of the subject that has been\r\n\r\nintroduced, like the H1, H2 and H3, in the JC curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the module-based system could be\r\n\r\ndesigned  to  have a few sets of core studies,  with  the\r\n\r\nbreadth  and  depth of knowledge within  it.   But,  most\r\n\r\nimportantly, to allow the children to have the confidence\r\n\r\nto  take  the  world, as the stigma  or  banding  of  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools  would not be with the  children,  and\r\n\r\nallow the flexibility to climb the education ladder.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My two other concerns are mainly on the\r\n\r\nimplementation details.  For any changes of the education\r\n\r\nsystem,  it must start with the teachers first,  who  are\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  and will be implementing  the  changes.   I\r\n\r\nquote  this  real example of a comprehension  test  of  a\r\n\r\nPrimary 1 child.  The comprehension is about the story of\r\n\r\na  match-box girl, who eventually died from the  freezing\r\n\r\ncold  with  a  joy in the heart.  The last  comprehension\r\n\r\nquestion was:  \"What happened to the little girl  in  the\r\n\r\nend?\"   The child answered:  \"The child died with a smile\r\n\r\non her face\".  I thought it was quite good that the child\r\n\r\nwas  able  to  grasp the concept of courage and  love  in\r\n\r\nadversity,  and at Primary 1 would have expressed  it  in\r\n\r\nthe  simplest way.  However, the answer was marked  wrong\r\n\r\nbecause the child added the phrase \"with a smile  on  her\r\n\r\nface\".  This phrase was not in the comprehension article.\r\n\r\nWell,  I presume the parent should have taught the  child\r\n\r\nto  be examination-smart, to follow the text strictly and\r\n\r\nshould not be creative and imaginative, or at least  that\r\n\r\ncreativity had its limits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my recent contacts with teachers, their concerns\r\n\r\nhave  always been that there were too many and  too  much\r\n\r\nchanges  in the curriculum, and the teaching skills  that\r\n\r\nmany  are  ill-prepared.   One reason  is  the  speed  of\r\n\r\nimplementation, the other is the length of  training  and\r\n\r\nthe  learning  curve needed.  This review requires  major\r\n\r\ntraining in the teaching skills.  Training would  require\r\n\r\ntime and effort for the change to be realised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is too little and too late. My\r\n\r\nfinal concern is that we may want to take a short cut, in\r\n\r\nview of our limited resources, to introduce knowledge and\r\n\r\ninquiring  skills to the top 25% upper secondary  and  JC\r\n\r\nstudents  for  independent thinking,  analytical  skills,\r\n\r\ninnovation  and  creativity.  But if, in  the  course  of\r\n\r\nprimary  and lower secondary education of eight years  or\r\n\r\nmore, the mode of teaching had been one of rote learning,\r\n\r\nand if the majority of our students are frowned upon,  or\r\n\r\nworse, punished for displaying independent thinking,  the\r\n\r\nasking  of  whys,  the asking of hows, sometimes  due  to\r\n\r\ntheir young age,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmay  sound  like challenging, then how can our  students,\r\n\r\nwho  excel in that kind of rote learning environment  for\r\n\r\neight  years of more, now be able to turn around  and  do\r\n\r\nthe  reverse in the upper secondary level?  The  argument\r\n\r\nof  the  Review Committee is that Singapore  is  changing\r\n\r\nfrom  an  industrial  economy to one that  is  knowledge-based.   Hence,  to prepare our young to  be  our  future\r\n\r\nleaders   and  contributing  citizens,  the   revamp   is\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this as the background, why then limit the\r\n\r\nreview  to  the top 25% students?  I urge that the  other\r\n\r\n75%  students in the secondary schools should  be  within\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of this change of the core curriculum  under\r\n\r\nthis  review.  In other words, since we need  to  develop\r\n\r\nconceptual  thinking and other knowledge  process  skills\r\n\r\nacross   the   curriculum,  especially  on  communication\r\n\r\nskills, knowledge and inquiring skills, which are  needed\r\n\r\nin a globalised economy and the service industry, why not\r\n\r\nintroduce  these  lifelong learning  skills  to  all  our\r\n\r\nstudents from the primary level onwards, and not limit it\r\n\r\nto the top 25% upper secondary school children?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Dr Ng Eng Hen has argued and told us that\r\n\r\nthe  resources  spent  on the lower stream  students  are\r\n\r\nhigher than the pre-university students, these are  basic\r\n\r\nlifelong skills and it should be implemented as widely as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, implement some of the recommendations\r\n\r\nto  a wider student population, to allow our students  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  their  own  talent, their own interest,  without\r\n\r\nbeing banded or differentiated downward by the school and\r\n\r\nthe society.\r\n\r\n<br>3.56 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, first of all, let me thank the 34  Members\r\n\r\nwho  were not from the Ministry of Education and my three\r\n\r\ncolleagues for their views and contributions during  this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State, Mr Tharman, has dealt\r\n\r\nwith most of the questions and comments raised by Members\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nover the last three days.

Let me take a  step  back  and\r\n\r\naddress   the  key  issues  raised  by  the  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  in  the last few days, not  just  about  this\r\n\r\nreview, but also about education in Singapore as a  whole\r\n\r\n- how do we make improvements to various parts of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the main issues raised can be collected into\r\n\r\nfive major areas.  First, why the JC level?  What have we\r\n\r\ndone  for  the  rest  of our kids?   That  is  the  first\r\n\r\nquestion.   Second question is one of elitism,  and  more\r\n\r\nstreaming.   The  third question is about the  curriculum\r\n\r\nitself - broadening.  Will it lead to more stress?   Will\r\n\r\nit lead to heavier workload?  The fourth question is that\r\n\r\nof  teachers.  And the fifth question, one which has been\r\n\r\ntouched  on by various Members, is how do we measure  the\r\n\r\nsuccess of our education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not touch on all these issues because several\r\n\r\nof  them  have been addressed adequately by  Mr  Tharman.\r\n\r\nInstead,  let  me take a slightly different approach  and\r\n\r\nanswer  some of these questions as I go along.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  Members to go through with me  my  thought\r\n\r\nprocess in the last five to six years as I have been with\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Education and how we have  implemented\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first things I decided to do was not to\r\n\r\nstay in Singapore all the time and visit just our schools\r\n\r\nin  Singapore because then you get locked into a  system.\r\n\r\nYou  begin  to think that this is the only way  of  doing\r\n\r\nthings.   And  so  I  had  spent  quite  a  lot  of  time\r\n\r\ntravelling and visiting school systems around the  world.\r\n\r\nIn the East - Korea, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and all the\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries.   In  the West -  in  Europe,  Britain,\r\n\r\nFrance,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSweden, Finland, Germany and Switzerland; and in the  US.\r\n\r\nI  have  been  to  the US many times.  And  also  a  very\r\n\r\ninteresting  education system in Israel.  I have  learned\r\n\r\nmany things from these visits.  One of the most important\r\n\r\nthings that I have learned from all these visits is  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  an  enormously strong education system.   I  am\r\n\r\nalways  a  little  amused that, whenever  I  visit  these\r\n\r\ncountries,  we get a lot of compliments.  That  fortifies\r\n\r\nme  for when I come back to Singapore and come into  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we have such a strong system, then why do we\r\n\r\nwant  to  change it?  I think we have heard many reasons,\r\n\r\nand  Members  agree.  We want to be in time to  meet  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   We  have  a strong system for today,  and  that\r\n\r\nstrong  system was based on the reforms that were put  in\r\n\r\nplace  in  1979,  courageously supported by  this  House.\r\n\r\nThis  brought about streaming, catering to the  different\r\n\r\nabilities  of our students, much maligned today,  but  it\r\n\r\nhas  in fact led to high levels of achievement not  found\r\n\r\nanywhere else in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked for this one sheet from the Third\r\n\r\nInternational  Mathematics  and  Science  Study   to   be\r\n\r\ndistributed.   It shows not just a point where  Singapore\r\n\r\nstands,  but it shows a band where Singapore stands.   It\r\n\r\nshows  a  band  of  achievement of Mathematics  at  about\r\n\r\nSecondary 2, from the 5th to the 95th percentile  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents.   And we stand out there in front of the  world\r\n\r\nbeating   every  other  country.   It  is   an   enormous\r\n\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students at the Normal (Academic) level perform\r\n\r\nnear  Belgium's  average,  who  ranked  6th  out  of   38\r\n\r\ncountries.  Our Normal (Technical) students perform  near\r\n\r\nItaly's  average,  just below the international  average.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  reason at all for our  students  to  \"walk\r\n\r\nsoftly\",  or to feel disadvantaged.  They have  benefited\r\n\r\nfrom  an  education system that has put them up there  on\r\n\r\ntop of the world able to compete with others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing our education system is a bit like changing\r\n\r\nthe tyres on a car that is moving down the road.  It is a\r\n\r\nhazardous business.  It is a bumpy ride for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npassengers,  very  dangerous for the  driver,  even  more\r\n\r\ndangerous for the one trying to change the tyres.  So why\r\n\r\nhave  we  started to change at the JC level?   Basically,\r\n\r\nthere  are three reasons.  Firstly, the JC level  is  the\r\n\r\nlevel   at  which  change  is  most  needed.    We   have\r\n\r\nsubstantially  a strong primary education system.   There\r\n\r\nare  improvements that can be made.  I concede  that  and\r\n\r\naccept that.  And we have been making improvements as  we\r\n\r\ngo  along.  We have the LSP for children who are weak  in\r\n\r\nEnglish  Language when they come to school.  We have  the\r\n\r\nENABLE  programme to help students along.  By and  large,\r\n\r\nwe  have  achieved  high standards, high  levels  in  our\r\n\r\nprimary   school  education  which  have  made   a   firm\r\n\r\nfoundation for the secondary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary school level, we also have high\r\n\r\nachievement  levels.  You can see that  for  Secondary  2\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Third  International Mathematics  and  Science\r\n\r\nStudy.   Completion  rates  are high,  articulation  into\r\n\r\nhigher  education is also high.  We are at  levels  which\r\n\r\nBritain  hopes  to  reach  -  85%  having  post-secondary\r\n\r\neducation beyond Secondary 4.  That is quite a remarkable\r\n\r\nachievement.  And that achievement is possible because of\r\n\r\nthe strengths in our education system, laid down with the\r\n\r\nfoundations  of the Goh Keng Swee Report.  Without  those\r\n\r\nfoundations, we would not have been able to move forward.\r\n\r\nWe would not even be able to make the changes that we are\r\n\r\nproposing to do today, because the foundations would  not\r\n\r\nhave been there for us to make these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why at the JC level? The JCs, as I said, are the\r\n\r\narea where the changes are needed most.  I have looked at\r\n\r\nschools  in various parts of the world.  And one  of  the\r\n\r\nmost  attractive schools that I went to, early in my term\r\n\r\nas  Minister  for  Education, was Thomas  Jefferson  High\r\n\r\nSchool  in  the Washington DC area.  It is a  Mathematics\r\n\r\nand  Science  school  and the students  were  doing  very\r\n\r\ninteresting  projects,  our equivalent  of  Secondary  3,\r\n\r\nSecondary  4,  JC 1 and JC 2.  And I was  very  enthused.\r\n\r\nThere was a very enthusiastic principal, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was turning over in my mind why is it that we are\r\n\r\nnot  able to do this.  And it suddenly struck me that one\r\n\r\nof  the reasons is that, during the same four years,  our\r\n\r\nstudents of the same calibre are spending a lot  of  time\r\n\r\nstudying  for their 'O' level and 'A' level examinations.\r\n\r\nSome  of  these students will require that  structure  in\r\n\r\norder for them to proceed.  But some of the students  can\r\n\r\ndo  without that structure, and that structure is  really\r\n\r\nholding them down and stopping them from blossoming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like you to look again at this Table that I\r\n\r\nhave distributed.  It is an interesting Table because, as\r\n\r\nI said, it contains the 5th to the 95th percentile.  What\r\n\r\nis interesting is not the students who were there.  It is\r\n\r\nquite  clear that our education system has provided  well\r\n\r\nfor the mass of the students.  And my responsibility,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Education, is to make  sure  that  we\r\n\r\nprovide  for all our students as best as I can  from  the\r\n\r\nresources voted to me by this House.  And there is  proof\r\n\r\nthat,  in  fact, we have done well for the  mass  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents.   But  the students who are not there  are  the\r\n\r\nones  who  are  interesting.  We are one of the  smallest\r\n\r\ncountries   on   that  list  -  3.2  million   indigenous\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, 270 million Americans.  We have about 5% at\r\n\r\nthe  bottom  end, 5% at the top end who are not  on  that\r\n\r\nlist.   The numbers are small.  It allows us to see  what\r\n\r\nwe  can  do  for these students.  We have many programmes\r\n\r\nfor  the students at the lower end.  I have described our\r\n\r\nLearning  Support  Programme, and so  on.   And  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  high levels.  Our Normal (Technical)  students,\r\n\r\nas I said just now, are at the international average.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about the students in the top 5%? Many of\r\n\r\nthe  good models of education that my colleagues in  this\r\n\r\nHouse have spoken about are actually models of education,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is MIT, Brooklyn High, Bronx High, which  are\r\n\r\nreally  for students who are not on the chart.  They  are\r\n\r\nin  the  top 1/2%, 1% maybe, of the population.  We  have\r\n\r\nmaybe  5%  or  2,000 a year.  If you look at  the  United\r\n\r\nStates, they are about 90 times our population, ie, 5%  x\r\n\r\n90 is 450 of our percent.  They have 4.5\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntimes more students not on that chart than we have in one\r\n\r\nwhole  cohort.   They provide for them in  a  variety  of\r\n\r\nways.   We need to provide for them too in order  to  get\r\n\r\nthe most out of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this an elitist system? My colleague, Dr Ng Eng\r\n\r\nHen, has shown from his data yesterday that, in fact,  we\r\n\r\ndo  provide  a very good education for all our  students.\r\n\r\nThe  JC  students academically are the top 25%.  Our  ITE\r\n\r\nstudents academically are in the lower quartile.  But  we\r\n\r\nprovide for them very adequately, and we will continue to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  them as much as they need to  have  a  good\r\n\r\neducation.   So  we  must not short-change  ourselves  by\r\n\r\nfailing to provide for our good students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is the two points that I have made\r\n\r\nearlier  in  my opening speech.  The first  is  that  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  meritocracy continue  to  apply.   As  Mr\r\n\r\nTharman said, in the United States, many of these top  5%\r\n\r\nare  in  private  schools - at high  altitude,  breathing\r\n\r\nrarefied  air.   Our  schools take in students  from  all\r\n\r\nbackgrounds,  whatever  their socio-economic  background,\r\n\r\nprovided  they can make it.  And our primary schools  and\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools are strong enough to  make  sure  that\r\n\r\nstudents from all backgrounds, provided they can do well,\r\n\r\ncan benefit from the best that our education system, that\r\n\r\nour  country  can  offer  them.  That  is  a  fundamental\r\n\r\ndifference  between our system and the  US  system,  when\r\n\r\nmuch  of  the top end, or the top 5%, is provided  really\r\n\r\nout  of  the private sector for people who can afford  to\r\n\r\npay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need to change our JC/upper secondary system\r\n\r\nin  order to provide different paths for our students  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can develop.  And this is one of the important\r\n\r\nthings that we need to do.  But one of the dilemmas I had\r\n\r\nto  face  -  and why it took me so many years, because  I\r\n\r\nvisited Thomas Jefferson School in 1997 and this is 2002,\r\n\r\nand almost 2003 - is that I could not resolve in my mind,\r\n\r\nperhaps I am an Engineer, as Ms Indranee said, and I  was\r\n\r\nlooking   for   a   clean   solution   which   could   be\r\n\r\nsystematically  applied  to  all  our  students  and  was\r\n\r\nsearching  for  one.  We have a very neat  system  today.\r\n\r\nSix years\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  primary  school,  four  to five  years  of  secondary\r\n\r\nschool,  and  after  that,  people  disperse  to  various\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   I was trying to look for  a  neat,  clean\r\n\r\nsolution, a system, a basis like that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, I have to think of the students\r\n\r\nwho are going to polytechnics and ITE.  To cause them  to\r\n\r\ngo  through 12 years in school I think would be the wrong\r\n\r\nthing to do.  I have looked at the US system too, not the\r\n\r\ntop  end,  but the middle band.  And I think 12 years  of\r\n\r\nhigh  school,  12 years of education, is  not  the  right\r\n\r\nthing  to do in school.  By the time the students are  17\r\n\r\nyears  old, they are getting very restless and  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to stay in school and learn more Mathematics,\r\n\r\nGeography,  History,  or even English  Literature.   They\r\n\r\nwant  to  do something else which has relevance to  life,\r\n\r\nwhich has relevance to their work in the future.  That is\r\n\r\none  of  the  reasons why at the upper  secondary  level,\r\n\r\nGrades  11  and  12, the drop-out rates  are  high.   The\r\n\r\nalternative of trying to bring a vocational and technical\r\n\r\neducation into the high school does not work.  I have not\r\n\r\nseen it work satisfactorily anywhere, because a school is\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  kind of environment for this.   Our  ITE  and\r\n\r\npolytechnics provide a much better education for students\r\n\r\nof this type than trying to bring it into high school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other consequence, of course, is that if you\r\n\r\nbring  it into a high school, then you will end  up  with\r\n\r\nstratified high schools, streamed high schools, where all\r\n\r\nthe children will \"walk softly\" and they will not be able\r\n\r\nto  mix with each other.  You will have a different  kind\r\n\r\nof  problem.   So  I  had  a  tussle  between  these  two\r\n\r\nrequirements.   My  own  feeling was  that  10  years  of\r\n\r\neducation  was  about  right  for  the  majority  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents.  We need 12 and, possibly, a through-train  for\r\n\r\nthose students who can do well.  But how to put it into a\r\n\r\nsystem  that is neat, and which you can draw  on  a  two-dimensional chart, rather than a three-dimensional chart.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I could not find the answer.  That is  why\r\n\r\nsome  time last year, after thinking it through,  I  felt\r\n\r\nthat  the way forward was to allow for a system which  is\r\n\r\nmuch  more diverse with many more choices but, of course,\r\n\r\na system which is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  as  neat  and as clean as the system  that  we  have\r\n\r\ntoday.  One of the reasons why it has been difficult  for\r\n\r\nhon.  Members to understand the system is because  it  is\r\n\r\nnot so easy to draw a two-dimensional chart.  But that is\r\n\r\nbecause  if  we want to introduce more opportunities  and\r\n\r\nmore variety for our students, this is what we should do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondary school system, the primary school\r\n\r\nsystem,  can benefit from many of the concepts and  ideas\r\n\r\nbut,  as Dr Ng said, we should not have a parity in terms\r\n\r\nof  solutions, or we may be giving the students the wrong\r\n\r\nthing.   But  certain principles, such  as  communication\r\n\r\nskills,   lifelong   learning,  the  right   values   and\r\n\r\nattitudes, these are things which we pass to the students\r\n\r\nthroughout the education system anyway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put computers in the schools. The first students\r\n\r\nto   get   computers  in  the  schools  were  our  Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical) students when we started in 1994, not the top-end  students, because we felt that these students needed\r\n\r\nsomething hands-on to excite them, to keep them in class,\r\n\r\nto  help  them to learn.  So, we gave it to them.   I  am\r\n\r\nglad  many  hon. Members came with me.  They accepted  my\r\n\r\ninvitation  to  visit the ITEs.  They saw for  themselves\r\n\r\nhow exciting the learning environment is in the ITEs, and\r\n\r\nhow  engaged the students were.  This is something  which\r\n\r\nwe will not find in an education system in any other part\r\n\r\nof the world for this group of students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when we come to this reform, the critical area\r\n\r\nreally  was  in  reforming the  upper  secondary  and  JC\r\n\r\nsystem.   What are the other reasons why we have reformed\r\n\r\nthe upper secondary and JC system?  The second reason  is\r\n\r\nbecause it is faster to do it this way.  If we start from\r\n\r\nGrade  1 and move up, it would take us many, many  years.\r\n\r\nIt  would take us three or four years to develop a  whole\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  12 years for it to flow right  through.   It\r\n\r\nwill take us a very long time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I come to the third reason. It may be even more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  do,  if we start from Primary  1.   In  an\r\n\r\neducation  system, what motivates teachers, students  and\r\n\r\nparents\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis the end point.  If they cannot see what is at the end,\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  going to change their  behaviour  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning.  So, if we do not change the end, it  is  very\r\n\r\nhard  to change the beginning.  If we start at Primary  1\r\n\r\nand say this is what it is going to look like roughly  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  but,  in the meantime, for the next  11  or  12\r\n\r\nyears,  the students there are doing what they did before\r\n\r\nbecause  we have not changed it yet, it is very  hard  to\r\n\r\nget  people to envision the future and to be prepared  to\r\n\r\nchange.  Already, as it is, by putting a small change  in\r\n\r\nthe university admission system to say project work would\r\n\r\nbe  included,  as Dr Ng said, I think all  those  parents\r\n\r\nwith  primary school-going children will know that  their\r\n\r\nchildren are doing their projects and doing various kinds\r\n\r\nof  things.  The signalling is almost instant through the\r\n\r\nsystem.  And when we want to make a change later  in  the\r\n\r\nsystem,  in the rest of the system, it is much easier  to\r\n\r\ndo.   In  any case, in the meantime, the correct  signals\r\n\r\nare being passed down the chain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of education system are we trying to\r\n\r\ndesign?   This is something which some hon. Members  have\r\n\r\nasked.  When I look at the eastern education systems, ie,\r\n\r\nin China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea, we are high\r\n\r\non conformity, high on structure and high in achievement.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the systems in Europe, much of it has been\r\n\r\naffected,  if  I can put it neutrally, by  socialism,  by\r\n\r\npolitical   correctness  and,  as  a  result  of   which,\r\n\r\nstandards  have  not been maintained because  the  system\r\n\r\ntries  to  pretend that everyone is the  same  and  gives\r\n\r\neveryone  the  same diet, which leads to  not  very  high\r\n\r\nstandards.   That  is why people escape from  the  public\r\n\r\nsystem and go into private education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States, in a sense, is the opposite end\r\n\r\nof  the East Asian education systems.  It has some of the\r\n\r\nmost excellent schools I have seen anywhere in the world,\r\n\r\nbut  it also has some of the most dreadful schools I have\r\n\r\nseen  anywhere in the world.   It is a system of enormous\r\n\r\ncontrasts, and I am always surprised that, in  a  country\r\n\r\nthat  prides itself on equal opportunity, they  have  not\r\n\r\nhad a revolution yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what is it that we are trying to build. I went\r\n\r\nto  the  United States earlier this year and  I  met  the\r\n\r\nSecretary for Education, Roderick Paige.  I also met some\r\n\r\neducation  reporters and they all asked me, \"You  are  so\r\n\r\nhigh  up  on  the  Third  International  Mathematics  and\r\n\r\nScience Study, what is it that you hope to learn from the\r\n\r\nUnited States?\"  My answer was, \"We are a system of  high\r\n\r\naverages in Singapore, but in the United States you  have\r\n\r\na  system that has been able to produce high peaks.\"   We\r\n\r\nwant  to  try  to  marry those two  parts  together.   To\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  structure and the rigour of what  we  have\r\n\r\nwhich  has  given us those high averages and  put  us  up\r\n\r\nthere  on the top of the list.  But we must also try  and\r\n\r\nput  into our system a path which allows our people,  the\r\n\r\nvery  few people that we have, to reach those high peaks.\r\n\r\nBy  having  this  merger, this hybrid  of  what  I  would\r\n\r\ncharacterise  as an Eastern and the US education  system,\r\n\r\navoiding  the worst parts but pulling together  the  best\r\n\r\nparts,  I think we will have a very good education system\r\n\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we succeed? I think, yes, we can succeed,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are somewhere in between both systems  today\r\n\r\nanyway.  We are neither on one end nor on the other,  and\r\n\r\nI believe that in our system, which is small enough, with\r\n\r\npeople  forward-looking enough and people,  including  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, courageous enough to say, \"Yes, we  will  go\r\n\r\nfor such a system\", we can make it work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that of elitism and I think, to\r\n\r\nsome  extent,  I  have dealt with that  already.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant, as we move towards a system like this with  IP\r\n\r\nschools and so on, that the students in those schools  do\r\n\r\nlearn  that  they have a responsibility  to  society  and\r\n\r\ntheir  fellow citizens.  But it is not so simple,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve  Chia  would have it, that the schools have  to  do\r\n\r\nthis and do that.  The society has to do it, ie, parents,\r\n\r\nall  of us, by word, by deed, have to show to these young\r\n\r\npeople  that this is the right thing to do: \"You  have  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for  your  fellow  man,   you   have   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  your fellow  citizens,  you  have  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility for your country, particularly if you  are\r\n\r\nbetter off, brighter, more able.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened also to note that all Members who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  on the issue have come out  in  support  of\r\n\r\nprivate schools.  Freeing up the private school sector is\r\n\r\na   departure  from  the  meritocratic  practice  in  the\r\n\r\neducation system that we have today, since admission will\r\n\r\ndepend  in  part  on the ability to pay.   These  private\r\n\r\nschools  will  be  privately  funded.   Well-run  private\r\n\r\nschools  can  contribute  to  our  education  system   by\r\n\r\nproviding   an  added  source  of  ideas  and  innovative\r\n\r\npractices in education.  They can also cater to  children\r\n\r\nwhose parents might otherwise have sent them overseas for\r\n\r\na  secondary  or JC education for a variety  of  reasons.\r\n\r\nThis  is again an issue which I have tossed about  in  my\r\n\r\nmind  and wrestled with for a while, because of the  very\r\n\r\nsame  reasons that some of the hon. Members of this House\r\n\r\nhave also raised this issue of private schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance, it is reasonable to allow two to three\r\n\r\nprivately-funded schools to be set up.  We  will  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  certain requirements to ensure that  such  schools\r\n\r\nwill  offer  an  essentially  Singaporean  education  and\r\n\r\nencourage them to make sure that their students will  mix\r\n\r\nwell.  They will have to adhere to key national education\r\n\r\npolicies and have a majority Singaporean enrolment.   But\r\n\r\nwe  will regulate them with a very light touch, otherwise\r\n\r\nit is no point having privately-funded schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that as long as our national\r\n\r\neducation  system continues to be innovative and  remains\r\n\r\nvibrant and responsive, and that we do not dumb it  down,\r\n\r\nour   national   schools,   with  merit-based   admission\r\n\r\ncriteria,  will  continue to remain the mainstay  of  our\r\n\r\neducation system.  As Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam said, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not be offering scholarships to privately-funded  schools, as any able student will always be  able\r\n\r\nto secure a place in our best state schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to commend hon. Members once again for\r\n\r\nweighing  the  issue  of privately-funded  schools  in  a\r\n\r\nconsidered manner and supporting their establishment.  It\r\n\r\nreflects  the  growing maturity of the  society  and  its\r\n\r\nreadiness to extend greater choice to people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue was one of broadening versus\r\n\r\nworkload, stress, and so on.  I do not propose to address\r\n\r\nthis   issue  in  detail,  because  I  think  Mr  Tharman\r\n\r\nShanmugaratnam  has  addressed it sufficiently.   Suffice\r\n\r\nfor  me  to  say  that I believe that our  students  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to work as hard, and that is not a bad thing.  I\r\n\r\nwould  prefer our students to work hard, rather than  not\r\n\r\nto  work hard, and then to have to persuade them to  work\r\n\r\nless  hard rather than to have to push them along to make\r\n\r\nthem work harder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, by changing the curriculum structure,\r\n\r\nassessment  system and what counts, we can influence  the\r\n\r\nmotivation  of  teachers, students and parents,  and  how\r\n\r\nstudents  spend their time and energy, and move  them  in\r\n\r\nthe  direction that we want them to.  This  is  what  the\r\n\r\nreview will do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth issue is the question of teacher\r\n\r\nreadiness.   Are our teachers ready?  The first  point  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  raise  is that  our  teachers  are  much\r\n\r\nmaligned.   They  are  really  quite  a  good  lot,  very\r\n\r\nenthusiastic and prepared to do many things.  And they do\r\n\r\na  lot.   I  hope that hon. Members will continue  to  be\r\n\r\nencouraging to our teachers, and speak to them and  treat\r\n\r\nthem  the  way we would want them to treat our  children,\r\n\r\nie,  encourage them rather than criticise  them  all  the\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are our teachers prepared to deliver the new\r\n\r\ncurriculum  with  its  greater  emphasis  on  skills  and\r\n\r\nbreadth?  We have a strong forward-looking teaching force\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not unfamiliar with change.  In fact,  when  I\r\n\r\nfirst  came in to the Ministry of Education, Mr  Lawrence\r\n\r\nSia,  an  hon. Member of this House before, told  me  how\r\n\r\nmany  Ministers for Education he had survived  and  said,\r\n\r\n\"We have seen all these changes, we are used to all these\r\n\r\nchanges, and we have been changing all the time.\"  So  he\r\n\r\nwanted to see what this new Minister for Education  would\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system has been changing and adapting\r\n\r\nall  this  while, and so have our teachers.  They  are  a\r\n\r\nremarkably resilient lot who have been very adaptable  to\r\n\r\nchange.  One example is when we introduced computers,  as\r\n\r\nMr Tharman\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nShanmugaratnam  said.  We only did that five  years  ago.\r\n\r\nInitially,  schools were not wanting to be first  on  the\r\n\r\nqueue to be computerised.  But after a year or a year and\r\n\r\na  half, when I visited schools, they were asking,  \"When\r\n\r\nis  it  our  turn?  We want to go.\"  And  this  is  about\r\n\r\nteachers across-the-board.  I went to one school where  I\r\n\r\nwas  very  pleasantly surprised to find that the  Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage Department in this very neighbourhood school was\r\n\r\nthe first in that school to have gone computerised.  They\r\n\r\nsaw it coming, they got the computers, they got together,\r\n\r\ntrained themselves and moved forward.  So, they were more\r\n\r\nready  than  anybody else in that school with  computers.\r\n\r\nThese are the kinds of teacher that we do have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our teachers enjoy opportunities for professional\r\n\r\ndevelopment  throughout  their  careers.   The   National\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education - I think hon. Members may not  be\r\n\r\naware  of this, but some Members are more active  in  the\r\n\r\nNational  Institute  of  Education  -  has  undergone   a\r\n\r\ncomplete revamp in the last five years.  Perhaps I should\r\n\r\nalso  invite hon. Members to come and visit the  National\r\n\r\nInstitute of Education to see what has happened.  We  run\r\n\r\nnow  one  of the best courses for principals anywhere  in\r\n\r\nthe world.  It is a 6-month executive-type programme.  We\r\n\r\ntake  the principals through not just the education  side\r\n\r\nof   it  but  how  to  manage  people,  how  to  run   an\r\n\r\norganisation for change.  We attach them to companies  in\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector,  we  take  them  to  visit  schools\r\n\r\noverseas,  and they go back to the schools  with  a  very\r\n\r\ndifferent approach and attitude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIE has restructured its courses. One of the key\r\n\r\nthings that NIE stresses now is values education.  One of\r\n\r\nthe  reasons NIE stresses on values education is  because\r\n\r\nwe  have  seen an enormous transformation in our teaching\r\n\r\nforce.   In  the last five years, we have recruited  more\r\n\r\nthan  10,000 teachers.  Our whole teaching force is  only\r\n\r\n25,000  strong.  As Mdm Ho has said, we are  losing  many\r\n\r\nexperienced teachers.  We are taking many new teachers in\r\n\r\nand it is important that the values of the teaching force\r\n\r\nare maintained.  Values education is one of the key areas\r\n\r\nthat NIE is now focusing on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be happy to know that for assessment of\r\n\r\nschools,  we do not just do ranking by academic  results.\r\n\r\nWe  already have SEM in place.  It is, basically, a self-assessment of the school and, from time to time, we  will\r\n\r\nhave  an external validation board come in to have a look\r\n\r\nat  how the school is doing.  I think academic ranking is\r\n\r\nstill important, because it is a matter of accountability\r\n\r\nto you.  If we do not have ranking, you would ask for it,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  what  happened in the United  States,  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  and other jurisdictions.   The  parents,\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  and Members of Parliament wanted to  know  how\r\n\r\ntheir schools are doing, in relation to other schools  in\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been to school districts in the United\r\n\r\nStates.   They pulled me aside and proudly told me,  \"You\r\n\r\nknow,  in  TIMSS, we beat Singapore.\"  They are  watching\r\n\r\ntheir  ranking.  We  will be silly to  give  up  ranking,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  an important tool of accountability  for\r\n\r\nschools.   We  can  rank them on a  number  of  different\r\n\r\nareas.  That I agree.  But to stop ranking them, I  think\r\n\r\nit  would be to give up a tool of accountability to  you,\r\n\r\nsomething which our schools and educators owe to you.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  in  any jurisdiction in the world, I have  never\r\n\r\nbeen  to  a  school  district  where  the  teachers  like\r\n\r\nranking.  Of course, they do not.  Why would you want  to\r\n\r\nbe  held  accountable if you can get away  without  being\r\n\r\naccountable?   I  have never met a school district  where\r\n\r\nthe  teacher  said, \"Yes, ranking is a wonderful  thing.\"\r\n\r\nBut  I am surprised that Members of this House should say\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  stop  ranking.   Because,  if  we  stop\r\n\r\nranking, we would have no instrument of accountability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the personnel management system, we are\r\n\r\nintroducing a new personnel management system  to  assess\r\n\r\nour  teachers.   It is an open system.   It  will  assess\r\n\r\nperformance  and potential but it also has a very  strong\r\n\r\ndevelopmental element in it.  We have been working on  it\r\n\r\nfor  the last 2-3 years with Hays Management Consultants.\r\n\r\nIt  is  defined in terms of what teachers need to  do  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  quality  of education for  their  students.\r\n\r\nCertainly,  it is not based on absolute scores  of  their\r\n\r\nstudents.  It has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnever  been.   What  we are doing  now  is  that  we  are\r\n\r\nbeginning  to implement it in our schools. We will  start\r\n\r\nwith   the  management  level  in  the  schools   -   the\r\n\r\nprincipals, the heads of departments, subject  and  level\r\n\r\nheads - so that they understand the instrument very well,\r\n\r\nand  we  can fix whatever problems there are,  before  we\r\n\r\napply it to the teaching force as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we have enough teachers and teaching resources?\r\n\r\nWe  have  managed to improve pupil-teacher ratios  across\r\n\r\nthe  board - primary, secondary and JCs - over  the  last\r\n\r\nfew years. This is because we have strong recruitment and\r\n\r\nstrong retention.  And with the changes that we have done\r\n\r\nwith  EduPac,  the  salary structures and  the  retention\r\n\r\nbonuses,  we  hope that we will continue to  have  strong\r\n\r\nretention when our economy turns up as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the JCs and CIs, we had a pupil-teacher ratio of\r\n\r\n16.4 in 1990.  It has come down gradually, and it is  now\r\n\r\n13.2.   That  is the pupil-teacher ratio.  We  have  also\r\n\r\ngiven  resources  to our JCs, with school administrators,\r\n\r\noperations  managers and so on. Each JC has a  budget  of\r\n\r\nabout  $144,000 a year - $12,000 a month  -  to  hire  in\r\n\r\nadministrative help if they need to. They can  do  it  in\r\n\r\nwhatever  form they want.  When we implement the  system,\r\n\r\nwe do intend to give the JCs the resources that they need\r\n\r\nto do their job properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me address this issue of measuring\r\n\r\nsuccess.  I could not help a smile escaping from my  lips\r\n\r\nwhen  the subject came up on assessing success.  Measures\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  performance of our students in  TIMSS  are\r\n\r\nalmost  taken for granted and dismissed as irrelevant  by\r\n\r\nthis   House.   Or  even  more  strangely,   success   in\r\n\r\nMathematics  and  Science is seen as a  negative.   In  a\r\n\r\ndelightful little speech yesterday, Ms Indranee Rajah, in\r\n\r\na lovely leap of logic, ascribed poor road habits and not\r\n\r\nknowing  right from wrong, I suppose, to our emphasis  on\r\n\r\nMathematics   and  Science  and  lack  of   emphasis   on\r\n\r\nhumanities.   I think this is really going a  little  too\r\n\r\nfar.   In practically every country that I have been  to,\r\n\r\nmy colleagues have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomplimented me on the achievements in TIMSS, and  lament\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  serious shortages of people  adequately\r\n\r\ntrained and prepared in Mathematics and Science in  their\r\n\r\nschools - serious shortages.  And the more developed  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  the  more  serious the  shortage.   The  United\r\n\r\nStates  lives on imported engineers from abroad and  they\r\n\r\nknow that this shortage will affect their competitiveness\r\n\r\nin  the  future.  They also lament that they are under  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  pressure  from their public  and  electorate  to\r\n\r\nexplain  why  their students did not do  well  in  TIMSS.\r\n\r\nThey  are somewhat bemused when I tell them that  I  have\r\n\r\nthe opposite problem in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an excellent system today because of the\r\n\r\nchanges and adaptations that we have made over the  years\r\n\r\n-  the  vision  and  courage of my  predecessors  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education, who introduced those changes,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Members  of this House, particularly  in  1979,  who\r\n\r\nsupported them. We have not shied away from making  major\r\n\r\nand  difficult decisions to help our students  do  better\r\n\r\nand  address  the social and economic challenges  of  the\r\n\r\nday.   We  have made real improvements in education,  not\r\n\r\nwhitewashed the problems away or try and make people feel\r\n\r\nbetter  and then, 5-10 years later, they find  that  they\r\n\r\nare really worse off, rather than better off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result has been a resilient, rugged people,\r\n\r\nequipped  with  the  basics  for  economic  survival  and\r\n\r\nemployability.  We know that our education  system  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  one  because, to-date, we have  done  well  by  all\r\n\r\ninternational  measures and ranking that serve  as  proxy\r\n\r\nmeasures of how competitive our people are, how strong we\r\n\r\nare  as  a nation, and how well-prepared we are  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Singapore  has passed various  tests  that  the\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  global politics and the  world  economy\r\n\r\nhave  thrown at us.  Against all odds, we have  prospered\r\n\r\nand grown as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the proposed changes will build\r\n\r\non  our current strength and result in a better education\r\n\r\nsystem  capable of producing the leaders, innovators  and\r\n\r\ncitizens Singapore needs in a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nglobalised,  innovation-driven  future.   We  will   know\r\n\r\nwhether  this  latest  set  of  educational  reforms   is\r\n\r\nsuccessful  when future cohorts of Singaporeans  are  put\r\n\r\nthrough  the crucible of world competition.  The  market,\r\n\r\nnot us, will decide what the criteria for success are. We\r\n\r\ndo  not  know what the future tests are, what the  future\r\n\r\nchallenges are and what the future proxy tests that  will\r\n\r\nbe used to measure whether or not our education system is\r\n\r\nsuccessful  or  not.  We do not know.  But  what  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  do  here in this House is to  look  into  the\r\n\r\nfuture  and  try and make sure that our Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nthere  to  meet it.  Singaporeans must be  able  to  hold\r\n\r\ntheir  own and forge ahead, not just as individuals,  but\r\n\r\nas  a  cohesive united people.  The education system must\r\n\r\nbe  able to equip them with the knowledge, skills and the\r\n\r\nvalues to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House would have had the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  study the recommendations carefully in their totality\r\n\r\nand  make  an assessment of whether the proposed  changes\r\n\r\nare what we need to face the challenges ahead of us.  The\r\n\r\nroad  will not be a smooth one. There will be bumps along\r\n\r\nthe  way  in implementation and so on. The Whip has  been\r\n\r\nlifted,  and  I hope Members will vote with  courage  and\r\n\r\nconviction  and  give their full support to  the  changes\r\n\r\nproposed.  A\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclear  parliamentary  vote  of  support  will  show  that\r\n\r\nMembers  acknowledge that the changes  point  us  in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction and are committed to seeing through  the\r\n\r\nchallenges and issues we will face as we implement  them.\r\n\r\nIt  will  send a clear signal of the broad-based  support\r\n\r\nand    commitment    necessary   for    the    successful\r\n\r\nimplementation of the recommendations.
