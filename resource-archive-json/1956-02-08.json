The work of the City Council, Sir, is  work\r\n\r\nin  the  service  of the public,  but  I  personally\r\n\r\nconsider it inadvisable that City Councillors should\r\n\r\nbe  Members of this Assembly, let alone Ministers or\r\n\r\nAssistant Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are conscious of the fact that we have\r\n\r\ninherited this position of City Councillors together\r\n\r\nwith  the Rendel Commission's recommendations  about\r\n\r\nthat   body;  that  Government  has  rejected  those\r\n\r\nrecommendations; and that we have repeatedly had  to\r\n\r\nextend  for  short  periods the  life  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil.

However, here is my answer\r\n\r\nto   the  hon.  Member's  question:  Yes,  Sir.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  fully aware of the  urgent  need  to\r\n\r\nexpand the veterinary services available to farmers,\r\n\r\nand, as you will see, active steps have in fact been\r\n\r\ntaken  and are being taken at the moment to increase\r\n\r\nthat staff. Increases in the staff of the Veterinary\r\n\r\nDepartment were approved in the 1956 Estimates  last\r\n\r\nNovember.   Four  junior  officers  are  being   now\r\n\r\nrecruited. They will have a van and will be able  to\r\n\r\noperate as a mobile unit from village to village.  A\r\n\r\nnew  post of storekeeper is also being filled. We are\r\n\r\ntaking steps to recruit a team of 24 farmers - I hope\r\n\r\nthis will appeal to hon. Members - who will be trained\r\n\r\nby the Department in poultry inoculation work. These\r\n\r\nfarmers  will  be  used full-time with  departmental\r\n\r\nstaff for only two days a week and they will be paid\r\n\r\nfor that work. The rest of the week will be spent by\r\n\r\nthem  on their own farms. The idea, Sir, is to  seek\r\n\r\nto  bring  to  the  farmers a full understanding  of\r\n\r\nthese processes. In addition, Sir, arrangements  are\r\n\r\nbeing  made  to recruit eight temporary  inoculators\r\n\r\nand   two  van  drivers  and  to  equip  them   with\r\n\r\ntransport. These services will be used to  help  the\r\n\r\nexisting  staff  to  combat the recent  outbreak  of\r\n\r\nswine fever in the northern part of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following steps have been taken to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  senior staff.

During 1955, 609 families were re-housed  in  the Guillemard Housing Estate which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  specially  allocated  for  this  purpose.  The\r\n\r\nresettlement of the businesses and light  industries\r\n\r\npresented a difficult problem and after consultation\r\n\r\nwith the associations representing the undertakings,\r\n\r\nit  was decided that the most suitable area for this\r\n\r\npurpose  was Tanjong Rhu.

Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I  seek  your indulgence  to  advise  the\r\n\r\nAssembly   of  certain  aspects  of  matters   which\r\n\r\ntranspired  during the journey which I indicated  to\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly at the last sitting which  may  affect\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the people of Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the official purpose of our journey was to\r\n\r\narrange  with the Colonial Office for a date  for  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional conference at which we are to seek  a\r\n\r\nfresh  constitution for Singapore and to  prepare  a\r\n\r\ntentative agenda. I have the pleasure to inform hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  that it has now been agreed by the Colonial\r\n\r\nOffice  that  the  constitutional  conference   will\r\n\r\ncommence on the 23rd of April next and provision  is\r\n\r\nmade for its continuance for two to three weeks. The\r\n\r\ntentative agenda, Sir, includes the following items:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Definition of internal self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make it very clear, Sir, that the phrase\r\n\r\n\"internal    self-government\"    was     used     in\r\n\r\ncorrespondence with the Colonial Office long  before\r\n\r\nI  arrived  in England, but when I was in  London  I\r\n\r\nindicated to the Secretary of State for the Colonies\r\n\r\nthat,  as  a  result  of  my  discussions  with  the\r\n\r\nstatesmen of India and Ceylon, I had gained a  wider\r\n\r\nunderstanding of our problems and our  role,  and  I\r\n\r\ndesired it to be clearly understood that the  phrase\r\n\r\n\"internal   self-government\",  although   used   for\r\n\r\nconvenience,  should not be deemed  in  any  way  to\r\n\r\nlimit  the  nature or the status of the constitution\r\n\r\nwhich Singapore may seek at the April talks. Without\r\n\r\nin  any  way committing Her Majesty's Government  to\r\n\r\nexpression  of  views on any aspects of  the  issues\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  my  statement, the Colonial  Secretary\r\n\r\nagreed  completely  that the  term  \"internal  self-government\" is used for purposes of convenience  and\r\n\r\nis  not  intended in any way to limit the nature  of\r\n\r\nour  proposals or the consideration to be  given  to\r\n\r\nthem at the constitutional conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A date for the introduction of internal self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was agreed to on the understanding that Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Government was in  no  way  committed  in\r\n\r\nadvance  to  the  principle that a  date  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven,  but  that  the whole issue would  be  freely\r\n\r\ndiscussed at the conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The question of the structure of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The question of the future of the Public\r\n\r\nService.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The question of external relations and\r\n\r\nexternal defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during our later discussions a sixth item was\r\n\r\nadded - and  that is, citizenship, on  which  I  have\r\n\r\nmore to say later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also agreed that both the Colonial Office\r\n\r\nand  the Government of Singapore may add any matters\r\n\r\nto this agenda until the date of the conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the constitutional conference, Sir, my\r\n\r\ncolleagues   and   I   sought   certain    immediate\r\n\r\nconcessions.  The  first  was  multi-lingualism.  We\r\n\r\nrequested that the provision in the Singapore  Order\r\n\r\nin   Council  that  English  is  the  only  official\r\n\r\nlanguage  of  the  Assembly should be  deleted.  The\r\n\r\nSecretary of State for the Colonies warned us of the\r\n\r\npractical  difficulties involved but finally  agreed\r\n\r\nthat the Assembly should have the right, as soon  as\r\n\r\npossible, to decide for itself the question  of  its\r\n\r\nown   procedure,  including  the  question  of   the\r\n\r\nlanguages  to be used in the Assembly. He  indicated\r\n\r\nhis readiness to recommend an amendment to the Order\r\n\r\nin Council to delete Section 55 completely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item two, Sir, was the question of national\r\n\r\nservicemen  and  control.  The  Secretary  of  State\r\n\r\nconceded  that  it was only right  and  proper  that\r\n\r\nnational   servicemen,   comprising   citizens    of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  raised  by Singapore  and  paid  for  by\r\n\r\nSingapore,  should  be  under  the  control  of  the\r\n\r\npeople's  representatives and  not,  as  heretofore,\r\n\r\nunder  the  exclusive control of His Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor.  I  am happy to inform hon.  Members  that\r\n\r\nthis agreement has now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen fully enforced by the Singapore Colony Order in\r\n\r\nCouncil  dated  2nd  February,  1956,  which  passes\r\n\r\ncontrol of national servicemen from the Governor  to\r\n\r\nthe Governor in Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to my departure, I had received certain\r\n\r\ncomplaints from local service officers that they had\r\n\r\nonly  right  of  access to the Chief Secretary,  and\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  were  dissatisfied  with  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary's decision, they had absolutely  no  right\r\n\r\nof  access to the Chief Minister. I consider that an\r\n\r\nuntenable  position, and I am happy to  report  that\r\n\r\nthe  Secretary of State for the Colonies appreciates\r\n\r\nthe  situation  and has accepted our representations\r\n\r\nthat  civil  service staff associations should  have\r\n\r\nthe right of approach to the Chief Minister, through\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Secretary, on matters affecting  general\r\n\r\nconditions of service and public policy relating  to\r\n\r\nthe public service. This rule is now in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonial Secretary further agreed to recommend\r\n\r\nan amendment to the Order in Council to increase the\r\n\r\nnumber of appointed Ministers from six to seven,  so\r\n\r\nas  to  allow  the  Chief Minister  to  be  Minister\r\n\r\nwithout  Portfolio, to concentrate in this formative\r\n\r\nperiod on questions of co-ordination and orientation\r\n\r\nof  policy,  and to deal with the vital  issues  now\r\n\r\nbefore   us   arising   out  of   our   desire   for\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, Sir, which was not given\r\n\r\npublicity  at  the  time and which  has  since  been\r\n\r\nfinalised   is  the  agreement  with  the   Colonial\r\n\r\nSecretary  to  recommend  that  Section  25  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Colony  Order in Council  be  amended  by\r\n\r\ndeleting  the words \"Ex-officio\", so that in  future\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister is enabled to preside at meetings\r\n\r\nof  the  Council of Ministers in the absence of  the\r\n\r\nGovernor,  the  Deputy  Governor,  or  the   Officer\r\n\r\nAdministering the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am more than delighted to know that the\r\n\r\nonly   contribution  that  the   hon.   Member   who\r\n\r\nrepresents the P.A.P. can make to the achievement of\r\n\r\nmy  mission is a sneer. An important matter that was\r\n\r\nraised  during the talks concerned the  question  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship for Singapore. It was represented by  me\r\n\r\nand some of my colleagues to the Secretary of State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat,  in  the  light  of the comments  he  made  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it was vital that we should know  whether\r\n\r\nthe   Citizenship  Bill  which  the   Labour   Front\r\n\r\nMinisters  had  prepared, of which he  was  given  a\r\n\r\ncopy,  would,  if passed, be disallowed  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Royal Letters  of  Instruction,\r\n\r\nSection 7 (1) - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> 1 (1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I do not take corrections from\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member, Sir. My friend and colleague  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Minister for Local Government, Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing  (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat) made  it\r\n\r\nclear  that he opposed the Bill, that his colleagues\r\n\r\nand  considerable  sections of the population  drawn\r\n\r\nalong  racial lines were opposed to the question  of\r\n\r\ntwo  types of citizenship - one, a Singapore  citizen,\r\n\r\nand  the other a British national. In the course  of\r\n\r\nthe  discussion that ensued, Sir, it was made quite\r\n\r\nclear  by  my hon. Friend on his own behalf  and  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of U.M.N.O., and he assured me that we  would\r\n\r\nhave  the  support of the people he had in mind  who\r\n\r\nobjected  to the Citizenship Bill, that  if  at  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  conference in  April  Singapore  did\r\n\r\nachieve  the  status  of  an  independent  territory\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Commonwealth and could then  create  a\r\n\r\nsingle  Singapore citizenship, he and his colleagues\r\n\r\nwould  fully support a Bill to provide for a  single\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship, comprising all true Malayans,\r\n\r\nboth the British subjects domiciled in Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe long domiciled aliens in Singapore, subject only\r\n\r\nto  the conditions of an oath of loyalty and an oath\r\n\r\nabjuring  any other national loyalty. Sir, in  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, and particularly realising during the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  the  discussion that I was  placing  the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  State  for the  Colonies  in  a  very\r\n\r\ninvidious  position of indicating whether  he  would\r\n\r\nwaive  in  advance  the rights  of  Her  Majesty  in\r\n\r\nCouncil  in respect of legislation coming under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Section 7 (1) of the Royal Letters  of\r\n\r\nInstruction,  and  rather than embark  upon  a  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  would  divide Singapore, I  decided  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  preferable to wait for a  matter  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuntil  the  results of the constitutional conference\r\n\r\nwere   known,   because  this  is  an  issue   which\r\n\r\nunquestionably would rouse, and has in  a  mild  way\r\n\r\nalready  threatened to rouse, some racial  emotions.\r\n\r\nIt  is in these circumstances, Sir, and knowing  the\r\n\r\npeople  of this country and the forbearing  patience\r\n\r\nof  the domiciled races who have for years and years\r\n\r\nand   years   sought  to  attain  their   legitimate\r\n\r\naspiration  of  full citizenship  in  this  country,\r\n\r\nknowing  their  reasonableness,  I  felt  that  they\r\n\r\nthemselves  would  prefer to wait these  six  months\r\n\r\nrather  than  anticipate what may be a full  victory\r\n\r\nfor  all without racial divisions and without racial\r\n\r\nantagonisms.  Sir, it is in these circumstances  and\r\n\r\nwith  the solemn assurance of my colleague the  Hon.\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing\r\n\r\nthat I did propose at that juncture - a proposal, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  which I take responsibility - that this  item  be\r\n\r\nadjourned to the April meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add, Sir, that in our discussions\r\n\r\nand  negotiations  with the Colonial  Office,  which\r\n\r\nlasted  between the 10th and the 16th  of  December,\r\n\r\nthe  atmosphere was both cordial and  friendly,  and\r\n\r\nthere did seem to be a genuine desire on the part of\r\n\r\nthe   Colonial   Office  to   seek   to   understand\r\n\r\nsympathetically  and  to meet our  very  modest  and\r\n\r\nlegitimate requests. The keynote, Sir, of the  whole\r\n\r\ntalks  was one of reasonableness and that  goes  for\r\n\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the talks with the Colonial Office, I\r\n\r\nhad  interviews with the Treasury and  the  Bank  of\r\n\r\nEngland  officials, who indicated their  willingness\r\n\r\nto  support Singapore in any legitimate proposals it\r\n\r\nhad  for  enlarging  trade with Indonesia.  I  spoke\r\n\r\nparticularly  of Indonesia's request for  additional\r\n\r\nhard  currency  allocation in respect of  re-exports\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore of imports of Indonesian produce.  I\r\n\r\nmust  confess, Sir, that I met with a reception which\r\n\r\ngives  me  every hope that this will be  fully  met.\r\n\r\nBoth  the Bank of England and the Treasury indicated\r\n\r\nthat  they  would  be  happy to  send  observers  to\r\n\r\ncooperate  with  us  in the Pan-Malayan/Indonesian\r\n\r\nMinisterial trade talks which we expect soon to take\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, though the British Prime Minister, Sir\r\n\r\nAnthony Eden, was ill in bed, I did wish to see  him\r\n\r\non  one  matter and he had the extreme  courtesy  to\r\n\r\nreceive me and to assure me that he would give every\r\n\r\nsympathetic consideration to my suggestion  that  an\r\n\r\nall-Party parliamentary delegation should be sent to\r\n\r\nSingapore prior to the April talks. My anxiety there\r\n\r\nis  this,  Sir. I  do not wish British  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament or the British people to feel  that  they\r\n\r\nare  getting  a one-sided picture of Singapore  from\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  its  Ministers  and  therefore  are\r\n\r\nspecial  pleaders. I want them to realise that  what\r\n\r\nthey have heard from us is the truth. I want them to\r\n\r\nsend  their own men - independent investigators - and  I\r\n\r\nwant  that  they  should have every  opportunity  to\r\n\r\ndiscover  the  truth of our desires, our  abilities,\r\n\r\nand  the modesty, reasonableness and justness of our\r\n\r\naspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sounds very reasonable!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Members that on the 15th of\r\n\r\nDecember the Secretary of State for the Colonies and\r\n\r\nHer  Majesty's Minister of Works, on behalf  of  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's   Government,   presented   to   us,    as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Singapore Government, in  the\r\n\r\npresence of a gathering which comprised the Chairman\r\n\r\nand  Secretary  of  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nAssociation, a stone which was part of the fabric of\r\n\r\nthe Palace of Westminster. It is more than a hundred\r\n\r\nyears old, Sir, and is in the form of an elaborately\r\n\r\ncarved  Tudor Rose. It was salvaged from the  damage\r\n\r\nof   the   Victoria  Tower  in  Westminster  Palace,\r\n\r\ninflicted  by  the air-raids during  the  last  war.\r\n\r\nPrior to my departure for England, I did mention  to\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  on  both  sides  of  the  House   the\r\n\r\npossibility of the offer of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstone.  May  I  say, Sir, that I did appreciate  the\r\n\r\nfact that all Members on the Opposition Benches,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as on the Government Benches, rose above their\r\n\r\nnatural  anti-colonial feeling and appreciated  this\r\n\r\ngesture for a genuine act of friendship and courtesy\r\n\r\nthat  it  is. I accepted the stone with appreciation\r\n\r\nand I hope, Sir, to have the pleasure of handing  it\r\n\r\nto  you on an occasion that you may arrange, so that\r\n\r\nyou  will receive it on behalf of the Members of the\r\n\r\nAssembly  and  make arrangements for  its  permanent\r\n\r\nincorporation in the fabric of this building. I know\r\n\r\nthat  all hon. Members will wish to join us  in  our\r\n\r\nthanks  to the British Government for this symbolic\r\n\r\ngesture  of  friendship and unity  between  the  two\r\n\r\nAssemblies  of  Westminster  and  Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\ntraditions of the democratic process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come to one other aspect of our visit to\r\n\r\nEngland - our main task as we saw it - and that  was  to\r\n\r\nmake  the  British people conscious of the truth  of\r\n\r\nour   position   and  the  reasonableness   of   our\r\n\r\naspirations,  and  to  create, in  anticipation,  an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  goodwill for our  forthcoming  April\r\n\r\nconference. The Information Officer in Malaya House,\r\n\r\nMr  John Batten, and Mr S. C. Lim of Radio Malaya,\r\n\r\nwhom I took with me as Public Press Liaison Officer,\r\n\r\ndid  magnificent work in preparing a most  intensive\r\n\r\nprogramme  of daily talks, meetings, broadcasts  and\r\n\r\ntelevision interviews. I understand it is  estimated\r\n\r\nthat  almost  every Member of the House  of  Commons\r\n\r\nheard  us  at some time or another; that some  seven\r\n\r\nmillion televiewers heard and saw us; and that  the\r\n\r\nradio  audience was far larger. In so far as letters\r\n\r\nreceived  and Press reports indicated, the  reaction\r\n\r\nwas  very,  very sympathetic. We were received  with\r\n\r\nreal  interest  and with friendliness.  The  British\r\n\r\nLabour  Party, Sir, and the Fabian Society  made  us\r\n\r\nfeel  very much at home, but to my mind perhaps  the\r\n\r\noutstanding  incident of that visit to London,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwas   a  very  large  meeting  of  the  Conservative\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  Parliamentary  Association   and   the\r\n\r\nConservative   Commonwealth  Association   which   I\r\n\r\nattended and which I addressed. I realised the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact  that they were seasoned politicians  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  only way to deal with them in the short time  I\r\n\r\nhad  was  to indulge in the blunt truth. I addressed\r\n\r\nthem, Sir, with very considerable frankness. I think\r\n\r\nI  would like to report to this House - it took me  by\r\n\r\nsurprise  and I hope it gives hon. Members the  same\r\n\r\npleasure  as  it gave me - that speaker after  speaker\r\n\r\nfrom that responsible Conservative organisation rose\r\n\r\nup  and  emphatically rejected the doctrine  of  the\r\n\r\n\"nobility  of colonialism\" with which we  have  been\r\n\r\nplagued.  They  said, \"Mr Marshall,  Colonel  Blimp\r\n\r\ndoes not live here any more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Where has he gone to?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He is in Singapore. This\r\n\r\nresponsible  group of Conservatives, Sir,  expressed\r\n\r\nearnest sympathy for our aspirations. I will confess\r\n\r\nthat these sentiments were unexpected. I started off\r\n\r\nby telling them that I understood that they were the\r\n\r\nbottleneck to the attainment of our aspirations, but\r\n\r\nI  do  say this: Having heard them and having spoken\r\n\r\nto  them  in  private, I do believe them  and  I  am\r\n\r\nhoping that the constitutional talks next April will\r\n\r\nprove that they were not merely polite but that they\r\n\r\nwere  genuine and sincere. Frankly, Sir, nowhere  in\r\n\r\nLondon  did  I  meet with that antagonism  and  that\r\n\r\npetty-fogging   objection  to  our  aspiration   for\r\n\r\nindependence   which   we  traditionally   meet   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  could wish - and  I  say  this  in  all\r\n\r\nearnestness - that  the  warm sympathy  shown  by  the\r\n\r\nnormal   decent  Englishman  in  England   for   our\r\n\r\nconstitutional  aspirations could  be  reflected  in\r\n\r\nsome   small  measure  by  his  compatriot  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  That  would contribute very materially  to\r\n\r\nthe general welfare, stability and harmony essential\r\n\r\nto our progress. Independence we will have, or chaos!\r\n\r\nIt is a question of choice of sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst in London, Sir, one of the most delightful\r\n\r\nexperiences  was  meeting the  Malayan  students  in\r\n\r\nMalaya Hall. It was a really enjoyable gathering and\r\n\r\nI  hope that hon. Members who will be going with  us\r\n\r\nto  the constitutional conference in April will have\r\n\r\nthe privilege of meeting them, and I know they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill have the same thrill and pride in those sturdy,\r\n\r\nenthusiastic  and happy people who are the  students\r\n\r\nof Malaya in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to our journey through the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth nations - no less important  an  aspect.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, I consider it perhaps the most vital  part\r\n\r\nof  our travels. In Colombo, Sir, I was the guest of\r\n\r\nSir  John Kotelawala, the Prime Minister of  Ceylon,\r\n\r\nand  had  the  privilege  of meeting  the  Governor-General, Sir Oliver Gooniteleke, one of the  doughty\r\n\r\nwarriors of independence of Ceylon. Yes, it is  easy\r\n\r\nto sneer, we who walk in their footsteps, who do not\r\n\r\nknow the struggle which they went through for years,\r\n\r\nand  who now seek to tell us so and to obtain,  with\r\n\r\nease  sitting  in  our arm-chairs, that  which  they\r\n\r\nsweated through generations to obtain. It is easy to\r\n\r\nsneer. I do not. The Prime Minister of Ceylon,  Sir,\r\n\r\nasked  me to express to the people of Singapore  the\r\n\r\nbest  wishes and the sincere and active sympathy  of\r\n\r\nthe   people   of   Ceylon  for  our  constitutional\r\n\r\naspirations.   The  Government  of  Ceylon   further\r\n\r\nindicated  that,  should we require any  assistance,\r\n\r\nthey would be glad to accommodate us, whether in the\r\n\r\nrealm  of  expert Tamil educationists  to  meet  our\r\n\r\nvernacular education requirements or in the  way  of\r\n\r\nadvice   on  our  Central  Bank  or  our  Industrial\r\n\r\nDevelopment Corporation, which subjects I  discussed\r\n\r\nin  a  very  fruitful interview with  their  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two days that I spent in Colombo, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwent  some  distance to inspect the work  of  a  Mr\r\n\r\nMiddleton of the United Nations Technical Assistance\r\n\r\nAdministration, an expert who has dedicated his life\r\n\r\nto  bringing low-cost housing to Asian countries.  I\r\n\r\nconfess, Sir, that I was impressed by his work. I am\r\n\r\nno  technician, but the figures he gave and which  I\r\n\r\npassed on to my colleague the Hon. the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government, Lands and Housing are impressive.\r\n\r\nArrangements have been made to ask for Mr Middleton\r\n\r\nto be loaned to us by the United Nations, and it may\r\n\r\nwell be that he will be here, Sir, at latest by  the\r\n\r\nend of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bombay, Sir, I was the guest of the Governor-General and had the pleasure of meeting that very\r\n\r\nremarkable  person,  the Chief  Minister  of  Bombay\r\n\r\nPresidency, and his colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Delhi my colleague the Hon. Mr J. M.\r\n\r\nJumabhoy  and I were the guests of the President  of\r\n\r\nIndia.  During our four days' stay in New  Delhi  we\r\n\r\nhad  the  privilege  of meeting the  President,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  Mr  Nehru,  and  several  of  his\r\n\r\nCabinet  colleagues. On the 6th of  December,  1955,\r\n\r\nMr    Nehru,   that   dynamic   leader   of   Asian\r\n\r\nindependence,  gave to the Singapore Press  for  the\r\n\r\nSingapore people a message. I know, Sir, that it  has\r\n\r\nbeen fully publicized, but for the pleasure, I hope,\r\n\r\nof  Members in this Assembly and for the  record,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to repeat two small parts. In  one,  he\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am sure that the problem of Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  will  be  dealt  with   more\r\n\r\nadequately when the people there have the  sensation\r\n\r\nof freedom and have to shoulder the responsibilities\r\n\r\nthat follow it. I wish therefore all success to  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya  in\r\n\r\ntheir march to freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And further, Sir, just one more passage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We carried through our struggle for freedom over\r\n\r\nmany  long  years  in  India, but  did  it  through\r\n\r\npeaceful  methods.  We are firm believers  in  these\r\n\r\nmethods not only because they yield results but also\r\n\r\nbecause  they  do not leave trails of  conflict  and\r\n\r\nbitterness behind them and they help build a united\r\n\r\nnation.  The  dominant urges in Asian countries,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in African countries, are nationalism  and\r\n\r\nsocial  advance.  Both  are  essential.  Nationalism\r\n\r\nleads to political freedom. In view, however, of the\r\n\r\nbackwardness  of many Asian countries, the  question\r\n\r\nof  social  advance  and betterment  of  the  people\r\n\r\ngenerally is one of vital importance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One tangible result, Sir - since hon. Members love\r\n\r\ntangible  results - of  our  visit  to  India  is  the\r\n\r\nassurance received from the Government of India that\r\n\r\nthey  would  be glad to help us, whether  under  the\r\n\r\nColombo  Plan  or  otherwise, by  way  of  technical\r\n\r\nassistance  whenever  we  should  require   it   and\r\n\r\nwhenever they are in a position to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to report to you, Sir, and to hon.\r\n\r\nMembers that information has been received from that\r\n\r\ngood friend of Singapore, the Commissioner for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia  in  Singapore, that the Indian Government  is\r\n\r\nmaking  available to the Singapore Government  their\r\n\r\nmost senior official on government organisation  and\r\n\r\nmethods   in   order   to   investigate   and   make\r\n\r\nrecommendations  on  the  best  means  for  a   most\r\n\r\nefficient  and  economic civil service organisation.\r\n\r\nThe  officer  in question, Sir, is Mr  S.B.  Bapat,\r\n\r\nEstablishment  Officer and Director of  Organisation\r\n\r\nand   Methods  and  Vigilance  Department   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment of India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Pakistan my colleagues the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand the Minister for Local Government and I were the\r\n\r\nguests  of  the Governor-General, and met the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, Mr Choudhri Mohamed Ali, and his  Cabinet\r\n\r\ncolleagues. I am happy to inform this House that the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of Pakistan asked me to  express  to\r\n\r\nthe   people  of  Singapore  his  sympathy  for  our\r\n\r\naspirations,  which he considered  to  be  perfectly\r\n\r\nnatural.  He also assured me that the Government  of\r\n\r\nPakistan  would be glad to assist us in the  way  of\r\n\r\nstudy  facilities for our students  in  any  of  the\r\n\r\nspecialised subjects which they have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was a stirring journey of which the most\r\n\r\nimportant    achievements   are    intangible    but\r\n\r\nnevertheless vital to our future welfare. The  Press\r\n\r\nand  public  reaction in England was most favourable\r\n\r\nand  created  an  atmosphere which I believe  augurs\r\n\r\nwell  for the constitutional conference next  April.\r\n\r\nThe  friendship of the peoples of India, of Pakistan\r\n\r\nand  of Ceylon for Singapore found public expression\r\n\r\nand  it is very heartening, Sir, to be conscious  of\r\n\r\nthe fact that these great Asian nations are eager to\r\n\r\nwelcome  Singapore  amongst  the  great  family   of\r\n\r\nindependent  Asian countries. It is my  humble  hope\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore can look to these new-found  friends\r\n\r\nto  support  her  in  her desire  to  be  an  equal,\r\n\r\nindependent   member   of  the   Commonwealth.   The\r\n\r\nbitterness   of   racial   domination   and   racial\r\n\r\nexploitation which they have suffered as colonies is\r\n\r\na  matter  of recent memory to them. They  remember,\r\n\r\nthough they do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhate,  in the true spirit of their immortal  Gandhi.\r\n\r\nThey  have forgiven. Their friendship for Singapore,\r\n\r\nI  honestly  believe  to be absolutely  sincere  and\r\n\r\nabsolutely disinterested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking for myself, I look to them from the\r\n\r\ndepths of their experience to champion the cause  of\r\n\r\nSingapore in its efforts to obtain independence  and\r\n\r\nto  champion  that  cause  at  the  meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  Prime Ministers next  June.  We,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhave  not made any official approaches. We have  not\r\n\r\nasked for any commitments, nor have we received  any\r\n\r\ncommitments.  You are conscious, I  hope - I  am  very\r\n\r\nconscious,  very - that under the Rendel  Constitution\r\n\r\nthe  question  of our relationships  with  not  only\r\n\r\nforeign   countries   but  even   members   of   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  is  in  the  portfolio  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  and the reserved power of His Excellency.\r\n\r\nIt   is  the  present  constitution.  That  is   not\r\n\r\ndemocracy which is what we are seeking. My appointed\r\n\r\ncolleagues and I, Sir, intend, however, to seek  the\r\n\r\npermission  of  our  official  colleagues  and   His\r\n\r\nExcellency  to approach all Commonwealth  countries,\r\n\r\nnot only those great Asian nations with whom we have\r\n\r\nestablished relations of warm friendship,  but  also\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries. I would like to  approach  them\r\n\r\ndirectly as soon as we are ready with memoranda of a\r\n\r\nprecise   nature  on  the  subject  of   Singapore's\r\n\r\naspiration. If we are to succeed in being  an  equal\r\n\r\nindependent  member of the Commonwealth,  the  other\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Commonwealth are  entitled  to  be\r\n\r\nconsulted,  because they are affected. I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  fully  consulted  before  the  April\r\n\r\nconference  so  that there will  be  no  unnecessary\r\n\r\ndelay should they wish to make their positions clear\r\n\r\nin the relevant quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this connection I would like to say this.\r\n\r\nOur  approach  to these Commonwealth countries  must\r\n\r\nawait  the  formation  of the  all-Party  delegation\r\n\r\nwhich  I promised to this Assembly in gratitude  for\r\n\r\nthe wonderful support we received at the time of the\r\n\r\nconstitutional crisis. It must await an agreement - or\r\n\r\nat  least a recognition of any disagreement - by  that\r\n\r\ndelegation on the broad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbasis  of our representations. I will say this.  Two\r\n\r\nconstitutional advisers have already been appointed.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be no delay on that side, and  we  hope\r\n\r\nshortly  to  appoint  a  leader  who  is  a  man  of\r\n\r\nconsiderable eminence as a constitution maker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take this opportunity to express the\r\n\r\nwarm  appreciation of the Government  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith  which I hope all Members in this Assembly will\r\n\r\nassociate  themselves, to the Governments of  India,\r\n\r\nPakistan   and   Ceylon  and  their   very   helpful\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  in Singapore for  the  considerable\r\n\r\ncourtesy,  and  the  warm and  friendly  hospitality\r\n\r\nwhich they showed to Singapore's representatives out\r\n\r\nof  love for Singapore, although we were nothing but\r\n\r\nshadow Ministers of a colonial Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, that is not an appropriate\r\n\r\nquestion  for discussion here. I would like  to  say\r\n\r\nthis very briefly. In Singapore, as a result of  the\r\n\r\ninitiative  of  U.M.N.O.,  led  by  my  friend   and\r\n\r\ncolleague  the Minister for Local Government,  Lands\r\n\r\nand  Housing, a meeting was called of all  political\r\n\r\nParties  in  Singapore - those  represented  in   this\r\n\r\nHouse, those not represented, and even those not yet\r\n\r\nformed - and  we all agreed upon what we  sought.  The\r\n\r\nphrase  used  was  'internal self-government'  which\r\n\r\nmeans a fully-elected legislature in control of  all\r\n\r\ngovernment machinery other than defence and  foreign\r\n\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during my 'pilgrimage', as my hon. Friend the\r\n\r\nleader of the P.A.P. has so justly put it, I learned\r\n\r\nto look at it from an oppositive angle. In London  I\r\n\r\nmerely  put  it in this fashion - that  for  myself  I\r\n\r\nwould  not be prepared now to seek that status which\r\n\r\nstill  remains colonial, but that I would  rather  a\r\n\r\nmore  positive approach be taken - independence within\r\n\r\nthe Commonwealth, subject to concessions in external\r\n\r\ndefence and external affairs. I am happy to say, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  I  have  my  colleagues of  the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\ncompletely with me and I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  mandate from my Party. I am also happy to  report\r\n\r\nthat  my  friend  and colleague the  leader  of  the\r\n\r\nAlliance  has  indicated his full support  for  this\r\n\r\napproach. The exact details I would like to work out\r\n\r\nin  private  at  this all-Party  conference  and  in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with the constitutional adviser  whom,\r\n\r\nif  we find it necessary, we could ask to come  down\r\n\r\nto Singapore before our departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

I had to tell him what was in my mind so as to\r\n\r\navoid  having  the constitutional conference  pinned\r\n\r\ndown  to  discussing  internal  self-government.   I\r\n\r\nwanted  to  make it clear that that phrase  did  not\r\n\r\nlimit  us, and in order to explain why, I  told  him\r\n\r\nwhat  was  my  personal  view:  that  there  was  no\r\n\r\nquestion of discussion or obtaining views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the question of the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Telok  Ayer,  Sir,  there   is   this\r\n\r\ndistinction: the internal self-government  which  we\r\n\r\nwere  considering to seek still left us  a  colonial\r\n\r\nstatus  and  still left us a Governor with  reserved\r\n\r\npowers - it  is a negative position. We  are  still  a\r\n\r\ncolony.  I  want  an  end to colonialism.  It  is  a\r\n\r\npositive approach to the problem - independence within\r\n\r\nthe  Commonwealth.  You are a  free  territory,  and\r\n\r\nfreely  and voluntarily you make an agreement ceding\r\n\r\naspects of defence and foreign affairs.

Sir, we gave notice\r\n\r\nof this decision on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31st  of December last and the reason for it is tied\r\n\r\nup  with our talks in Baling on the 28th and 29th of\r\n\r\nDecember, when the Chief Minister of the  Federation\r\n\r\nand I, as his guest, and Dato Sir Cheng-lock Tan met\r\n\r\nthe Secretary-General of the Malayan Communist Party\r\n\r\nand  two of his colleagues. Sir, the House may  wish\r\n\r\nto know some of the details, some of which are known\r\n\r\nand some of which were not published. I will be very\r\n\r\nbrief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communist representatives sought strenuously\r\n\r\nto  obtain  recognition  of  the  Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty.  This was firmly rejected, but I must confess\r\n\r\nthat on the evening of the first day I gathered  the\r\n\r\nimpression that they seemed to be prepared to accept\r\n\r\nthe   statement  of  the  Chief  Minister   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  that he would not recognise the  M.C.P.\r\n\r\nbut  that  he  would permit members of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party, who, after a loyalty  check,  were\r\n\r\nfreed  and allowed to rejoin their families,  freely\r\n\r\nto  join  any political Party or to form  their  own\r\n\r\npolitical Party so long as that political Party  was\r\n\r\nnot   Communist.  However,  that  was   a   mistaken\r\n\r\nimpression,  and  the next morning we  learned  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  question  whatsoever  but  that  the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Communist Party was not prepared to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  term  of the amnesty which required  a  loyalty\r\n\r\ncheck   of  those  who  surrendered.  The  Communist\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   did   indicate,   Sir,   that   an\r\n\r\nappreciable number of their people may  wish  to  be\r\n\r\nrepatriated to China and the Tunku and I agreed that\r\n\r\nwe  would  not insist on the investigation of  those\r\n\r\nwho  would  be  leaving the country  under  official\r\n\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister of the Federation, Sir, went\r\n\r\neven further in his sincere desire to put an end  to\r\n\r\nthis regime of violence which is causing unnecessary\r\n\r\nsuffering to the people. He said to them that  if  a\r\n\r\nmajority  of  their leaders and a  large  number  of\r\n\r\ntheir   followers   were   prepared   to   opt   for\r\n\r\nrepatriation to China, then he might reconsider  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of limiting investigation by requiring  of\r\n\r\nthe   remainder,   who   stayed   in   Malaya,    an\r\n\r\ninvestigation which amounted to periodical visits to\r\n\r\nthe   police  for  report.

They said, \"We will not discuss  that\r\n\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the discussions at the second session\r\n\r\non  the  29th,  it  seemed as though  the  Communist\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  were  prepared   to   cease   their\r\n\r\nactivities of violence unconditionally in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture. Chen Tian, who was the interpreter, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As soon as you obtain...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen  it  was clarified. He said he would  not  even\r\n\r\nwait  for  Singapore. He was quite prepared  not  to\r\n\r\nwait  for Singapore, in case the Tunku thought  that\r\n\r\nSingapore might be slower. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As soon as the Federation obtains complete control\r\n\r\nof internal security and local armed forces, we will\r\n\r\nend  hostilities, lay down our arms and disband  our\r\n\r\nforces.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that seems to be rather important. It is true\r\n\r\nit  gave  no  hope for today but it  gave  hope  for\r\n\r\ntomorrow  and it was unconditional surrender.  So  I\r\n\r\nasked  him  to repeat it. I wrote it down  verbatim,\r\n\r\nand  in order that there should be no question about\r\n\r\nits accuracy, I sent that paper across and I said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Chin Peng, you read English. Is this it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  then  transpired that there was no  question  of\r\n\r\nunconditional surrender and they added:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This does not amount to acceptance of the amnesty\r\n\r\nterms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>However,  we  promised that that  would  go  to  the\r\n\r\nPress.  It went to the Press as emanating  from  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party. Then, Sir, we went  down  to  what\r\n\r\nthey  meant. They meant the same as they  mean  now.\r\n\r\nThey   meant   that  even  if  the   Tunku   obtains\r\n\r\nindependence,   before  they   would   cease   their\r\n\r\nactivities   of   violence,   they   would    expect\r\n\r\nrecognition  of  the  Malayan  Communist  Party,  no\r\n\r\nloyalty  check, no detention, unconditional amnesty,\r\n\r\ncomplete  freedom,  and  facilities  for  those  who\r\n\r\nwished to go overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, one more thing transpired which rocked\r\n\r\neven  the placid Tunku - and quite surprisingly. They\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Of course, when we speak of laying down arms, it\r\n\r\ndoes   not  mean  to  surrender  the  arms  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. That is in the amnesty terms which  just\r\n\r\nsay  'Lay  down arms'. To 'lay down arms'  means  to\r\n\r\ncease activities of violence. But we expect, when we\r\n\r\nare free, to have the right to retain our arms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the Tunku:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So you can start shooting me when next you\r\n\r\ndisagree with me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He made it quite clear that there would be never any\r\n\r\nquestion at all of the right to retain arms by those\r\n\r\nfree to rejoin society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did try to bring the question round to a\r\n\r\nclarification  of a possible time-limit  of  loyalty\r\n\r\nchecks and of conditions that might be acceptable in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the loyalty checks. That was  what  they\r\n\r\nobjected to, but they would not discuss the question\r\n\r\nin  detail,  nor  would they seek  conditions  which\r\n\r\nmight  be  acceptable.  They said  flatly - the  words\r\n\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I have no authority to accept amnesty terms which\r\n\r\ninclude a loyalty check.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did plead, Sir, that hatred and violence\r\n\r\nproduces nothing constructive. I appealed to them to\r\n\r\nthink  of  the welfare of the people as a whole - more\r\n\r\nthan  seven  million. I asked them not  to  set  the\r\n\r\nquestion of face, pride and the mild humiliation  of\r\n\r\ntheir small group\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the path of the welfare of the people which they\r\n\r\npretended  to seek. I seemed to be talking  to  deaf\r\n\r\nears. The reply I got was:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have said we have no authority whatever to\r\n\r\naccept loyalty investigations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in so far as Singapore is concerned, the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives made it quite clear that  they  were\r\n\r\nin  complete  control  of the  Communist  Party  and\r\n\r\nCommunist  sympathisers  in  Singapore.  Before  the\r\n\r\nmeeting ended, Sir, and with the concurrence of  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister of the Federation, I stated that  if\r\n\r\nthey  would sink their pride and the matter of  mild\r\n\r\nhumiliation  in  the  name of  the  welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  if they could see their way to a change  of\r\n\r\nheart,  the  Tunku and I would be prepared  to  meet\r\n\r\nthem again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must inform this House that I went to these\r\n\r\ntalks  believing  that there was an element  amongst\r\n\r\nthose  in  the  jungle who were genuine,  frustrated\r\n\r\nnationalists;  believing that we  might  reach  them\r\n\r\nbecause we are about to achieve independence through\r\n\r\nthe  democratic  process  and  we  need  all  honest\r\n\r\ncitizens, all sincere nationalists, to pull together\r\n\r\nat  this  period; believing that some of them  might\r\n\r\nrespond  to an appeal to their decent instincts  not\r\n\r\nto  hamper the economic and political advance of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  the  country  by  their  activities   of\r\n\r\nviolence.  Maybe  I  was flattering  myself,  Sir - it\r\n\r\nlooks  as  though I was, but I did hope to  persuade\r\n\r\nsome  of them. I would like to say this: I have come\r\n\r\naway  from  this meeting - and I do not say  this  for\r\n\r\npropaganda purposes in respect of those who are  not\r\n\r\nhere to defend themselves, but because I think it is\r\n\r\nmy  duty that the people of this country should know\r\n\r\nof  this,  whatever some hon. Members  opposite  may\r\n\r\nthink; I want them to know, those who believe in  me\r\n\r\nwill  believe  I am speaking the truth,  Sir - I  have\r\n\r\ncome  away from this meeting believing with  all  my\r\n\r\nheart  and absolutely convinced in my own mind  that\r\n\r\nneither  the  independence of these territories  nor\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the people matters in the  slightest\r\n\r\nto  the Malayan Communist Party. They do not care  a\r\n\r\nhoot! All they want is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  obtain control of the country. All they want  is\r\n\r\nthe expansion of their own imperialist Communism and\r\n\r\ntheir  own foreign ideology. They have more contempt\r\n\r\nfor the people than Colonel Blimp!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say this, Sir. There we have an\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the  Members of  the  Assembly,  to  the\r\n\r\nresponsible Press and to the people. I am  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat   the   Malayan  Communist  Party   and   their\r\n\r\nsympathisers  will  only cease their  activities  of\r\n\r\nbrutality  against  the  people  and  against  their\r\n\r\ngovernments,  against their economic  and  political\r\n\r\nwelfare, by means of violence, only when the Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party is convinced that it is losing  the\r\n\r\nsympathy of the people by continuation of these foul\r\n\r\ntactics.  It is for the people and for the Press  of\r\n\r\nthis  country  to  make  it  clear  that  under  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  process  we  are achieving  freedom  and\r\n\r\nprosperity, and we want none of the brutality  which\r\n\r\nis  the  hallmark of the Communist  Party.  You  can\r\n\r\nsmile,  Sir. We will not tolerate - and I do not  care\r\n\r\nwhat Press it is -  the violence and intimidation which\r\n\r\nis being perpetrated upon the people of this country\r\n\r\nby  those  who call themselves Communists.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection  and  in fairness to my outburst  against\r\n\r\nthat  person  sitting in the Strangers'  Gallery,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to say this: I was very pleased to  read\r\n\r\neditorials in the Chinese Press condemning,  in  the\r\n\r\nstrongest terms, the recent grenade outrage  against\r\n\r\ninnocent  members of a force that seeks  to  protect\r\n\r\nthe  peace of the people. I say let us have more  of\r\n\r\nthose   editorials.  Let  us  have   open,   public,\r\n\r\nspontaneous expressions of the disgust of the people\r\n\r\nat  this Communist regime of brutality. That is  the\r\n\r\nonly  way,  Sir, if we are ever to have  an  end  to\r\n\r\nCommunist violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the Baling talks, Sir, the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister of the Federation indicated  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  representatives that since they,  in  the\r\n\r\nname  of  the Malayan Communist Party, rejected  the\r\n\r\namnesty  terms, he could see no further  purpose  in\r\n\r\ncontinuing  them  and  he asked  them  whether  they\r\n\r\nconcurred, and in those circumstances, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister and I agreed that  the  amnesty\r\n\r\nterms  should be withdrawn after reasonable  notice.\r\n\r\nThe  Chief  Minister fixed the date after  informing\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of  Singapore,  and  the  date   is\r\n\r\ntoday - five months after its inauguration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, Sir, take this opportunity to express, on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Government and, I hope, the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, our appreciation and thanks to the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the Government of the Federation  for\r\n\r\ntheir  courtesy in inviting us to be represented  at\r\n\r\nthese  talks, and for the hospitality and  excellent\r\n\r\narrangements  they  made  for  the  comfort  of   my\r\n\r\nassistants and myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Was the Hon. the Chief Minister\r\n\r\npresent at these talks as a guest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

C.\r\n\r\nGoh,  who was responsible for documentation  of  all\r\n\r\nthe  memoranda submitted to the Committee and  other\r\n\r\ndetailed information obtained from various sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main recommendations in summarised form are\r\n\r\nfound  at  pages  47 to 50 of the Report.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of gratification to know that the Report is an\r\n\r\nunanimous  one and it is hoped that the  House  will\r\n\r\ngive  it  the  blessing  that  it  deserves.  It  is\r\n\r\npossible  that a Government White Paper on education\r\n\r\npolicy,  based on the Report, will be tabled  before\r\n\r\nthe  House.  As the Report touches on  questions  of\r\n\r\ngrave  importance and implications, full opportunity\r\n\r\nwill be made available for Members to debate on  the\r\n\r\nsubject at a later date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FLOODS AND FLOOD RELIEF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Labour and Welfare)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members of this House\r\n\r\nwill  doubtless want me to give them a statement  on\r\n\r\nthe  recent  floods  which occurred  on  Friday  and\r\n\r\nSaturday, the 27th and 28th of January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to be able to say that the floods this\r\n\r\nyear  were not so widespread or serious as in 1954.\r\n\r\nIn  all, about 7 inches of rain was recorded at  the\r\n\r\nMeteorological  Station, Singapore  Airport,  but  5\r\n\r\ninches in most other places,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  two  days,  the 27th and 28th  of  January.\r\n\r\nAccording to records, storms such as these are  not\r\n\r\nunusual  at  this  time  of  the  year.  The   Bedok\r\n\r\nresettlement and Ulu Bedok areas suffered most,  and\r\n\r\nas  the  water  rose  in these areas  it  was  found\r\n\r\nnecessary  on the night of Friday the 27th  and  the\r\n\r\nfollowing   day  to  evacuate  some   62   families,\r\n\r\ntotalling  330  adults  and  children.  The   Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department established a relief  centre  at\r\n\r\nthe Bedok Boys' School on Friday night, the 27th  of\r\n\r\nJanuary,  where  the  evacuated flood  victims  were\r\n\r\naccommodated  and given hot meals for  a  period  of\r\n\r\nfour  to  five  days. In all, 3,600  hot  meals  and\r\n\r\nsnacks were provided, while Government officers  and\r\n\r\nvoluntary   officers   gave   medical   and    other\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other areas, such as Lorong Tai Seng, Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai,  Jalan Eunos, Tampenis Road and one  or  two\r\n\r\nother  small  isolated areas,  minor  flooding  took\r\n\r\nplace  but no families from any of these areas  were\r\n\r\nevacuated, and damage was small. In view of the fact\r\n\r\nthat Bedok is a resettlement area for squatters from\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar who were resettled there when work began\r\n\r\non  the  Singapore  Airport, Government  accepted  a\r\n\r\nspecial responsibility towards them. Government  has\r\n\r\nalso  decided  to  accept  a special  responsibility\r\n\r\ntowards the families at Ulu Bedok where the flooding\r\n\r\nthis   year   was  largely  due  to   new   drainage\r\n\r\nconstruction works in the vicinity. These  works,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, will be completed soon and it  is  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  no flood damage will occur there again in  the\r\n\r\nfuture. As regards the other areas where only  minor\r\n\r\nflooding  took place, Government must  regard  these\r\n\r\nminor  elemental disturbances as the normal  hazards\r\n\r\nof farming life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning Government's special attitude to the\r\n\r\nBedok  resettlement  area and the  Ulu  Bedok  area,\r\n\r\nassessment   teams  completed  on   Wednesday,   1st\r\n\r\nFebruary,  their  investigation of losses  sustained\r\n\r\nand,   based   on   the  findings,  Government   has\r\n\r\nsubsequently  authorised relief  and  rehabilitation\r\n\r\npayments to flood victims amounting to $43,001.

I  have  personally\r\n\r\nknown  him for six years and during those six years,\r\n\r\nI  have  known him as a tireless worker  with  quiet\r\n\r\nwisdom  in the single-minded thoughts of the freedom\r\n\r\nof his country. That his country is now on the verge\r\n\r\nof freedom is, in no small measure, due to him and I\r\n\r\ntrust this Assembly will understand when I say  that\r\n\r\nit  is appropriate that these congratulations should\r\n\r\nhave  a personal aspect - congratulations not only  to\r\n\r\nthe people of the Federation but to the Tunku - and it\r\n\r\nis  for this reason that I anticipate and seek  that\r\n\r\nwe  should send these congratulations to him on this\r\n\r\nday, which has personal significance for him as well\r\n\r\nas   great   significance  for  our   brothers   and\r\n\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is enough information from reliable\r\n\r\nPress sources to indicate that he is happy with  the\r\n\r\nachievements of this Mission; that, in  fact,  there\r\n\r\nis  every  likelihood that our brothers  across  the\r\n\r\nStraits will achieve freedom next year. Sir, this is\r\n\r\nthe  triumph  of a sincere man and of a  people  who\r\n\r\nhave  the  sense  to recognise his ability  and  his\r\n\r\nsincerity - a people who gave him unstinting support.\r\n\r\nThere is no P.A.P. in the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been, Sir, and there are matters of\r\n\r\nirritation, matters of difference between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand the Federation.

Their  troubles  are  our  troubles,  their\r\n\r\nwelfare our welfare, and their joy our joy. We  feel\r\n\r\nfor  them - I  feel  for them - more than  a  matter of\r\n\r\nrespect,  something that goes deeper than affection,\r\n\r\nand   on  this  great  and  thrilling  day  for  the\r\n\r\nFederation, all irritations and all differences  are\r\n\r\nswept aside and I know we will all join together  to\r\n\r\ntell  the  Federation and its great  leader  of  our\r\n\r\nunbounded  joy  and our unalloyed gladness.

In times of joy and rejoicing,  they  look\r\n\r\nfor   fair   weather  friends,   those   who,   like\r\n\r\nthemselves, enjoy the flesh-pots of life.

It is the whole movement.\r\n\r\nIt   is   the   spirit  which  inspires  the   whole\r\n\r\ngeneration. The people of the Federation have  shown\r\n\r\nunequivocably  in  the  last  ten  years  since  the\r\n\r\nBritish returned to Malaya that they will have  none\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also notice that on occasions such as this, our\r\n\r\nnew-found  Socialist comrades on this  side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  talk  of fighting for freedom. They  want  to\r\n\r\nlead  the  fight.  I  often  wonder  whom  they  are\r\n\r\nthinking of fighting, because they have been so long\r\n\r\nin  this game that I think they have forgotten  whom\r\n\r\nthey  were  fighting  against, for  what  they  were\r\n\r\nfighting, and for whom they were fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had this morning a glimpse of the old\r\n\r\nChief  Minister when he told us that he was  ashamed\r\n\r\nof  this  constitution, that he  was  but  a  shadow\r\n\r\nMinister, and that we must fight and struggle on for\r\n\r\nindependence. I knew that sooner or later  he  would\r\n\r\ncome  back to a complete circle. First he downs  it.\r\n\r\nThen  he says, in moments of elation and joy, \"I  am\r\n\r\nthe  Government. We are the Government. We represent\r\n\r\nyou.\" Then in moments of depression he says, \"We are\r\n\r\nshadow  Ministers. Things are not working. Out  with\r\n\r\ncolonialism!\"   Every  time  they  say   \"Out   with\r\n\r\ncolonialism\", we are with them; but every time  they\r\n\r\nsay  \"We are the Government\", we stand on the  side-lines  and watch them and ask, \"How long will it  be\r\n\r\nbefore he goes back one complete circle?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing about the Federation's Chief\r\n\r\nMinister - this  is perhaps the only personal  note  I\r\n\r\nwill  touch  on  in referring to that  distinguished\r\n\r\ngentleman - is  that  he  has  the  great  quality  of\r\n\r\nknowing when not to say anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is a great advantage, because it saves him  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience  of having to deny what  was  said  or\r\n\r\nwhat   was  said  wrongly.  In  spite  of  all   his\r\n\r\ndifficulties, he has succeeded, in a matter of  fact\r\n\r\nway, in bringing home to the people of Malaya and to\r\n\r\nthe   Government  in  Britain  that  there  are  two\r\n\r\nalternatives  for  the British in  Malaya.  One,  to\r\n\r\nfight  the nationalists and the Communists, in which\r\n\r\ncase  there will be, as the Hon. the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nof  Singapore has said, chaos. Two, to take  a  more\r\n\r\nsensible  approach and say, \"This fight is finished,\r\n\r\nand should have been finished years ago. Let us sort\r\n\r\nit  out.

The  point  is\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  two  territories  become  independent\r\n\r\nseparately,  they  will  never  get  together.

A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I have the consent of the Governor\r\n\r\nunder Standing Order 33 (1) (a) to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now, I regret to say, several years since\r\n\r\nrepresentations were first received on behalf of the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community  in Singapore,  through  the  good\r\n\r\noffices  of  the Muslim Advisory Board,  asking  for\r\n\r\nlegislation  to remedy the unsatisfactory  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs   regarding   Muslim   divorces   and    the\r\n\r\nadministration  of the law of Muslim  marriages  and\r\n\r\ndivorces.  I had hoped, Sir, to get such legislation\r\n\r\nenacted  in  the previous Legislative  Council  but,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, it could not be got ready in time. In\r\n\r\nfact,  it  was only in November last year that  this\r\n\r\nBill was ready for introduction to this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main cause of concern amongst the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  Singapore is the very  high  rate  of\r\n\r\ndivorce amongst Muslim marriages. Investigations  in\r\n\r\n1953 revealed a divorce rate of about 60 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe  corresponding marriage rate - a  very  disturbing\r\n\r\nfigure.  Muslim marriages and divorces are regulated\r\n\r\nby the Muslims Ordinance Chapter 57 of our Laws, and\r\n\r\nas  the law stands at present, any one of the twelve\r\n\r\nKathis in Singapore, as a Deputy Registrar of Muslim\r\n\r\nMarriages, can register a marriage or a divorce  for\r\n\r\nany Muslim person who has been resident in Singapore\r\n\r\nfor more than four months. Each of these Kathis also\r\n\r\nhas  the power of a civil court to enquire into  and\r\n\r\nadjudicate  upon  claims for the payment  of  dowry,\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  such  matters.  These  Kathis  are\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Governor, but they are  not  paid.\r\n\r\nThey  retain the fees for solemnising marriages  and\r\n\r\nregistering  divorces,  and  appeals  against  their\r\n\r\ndecisions  go  to the Registrar of Muslim  Marriages\r\n\r\nwho is not himself a Muslim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, it is generally admitted amongst the\r\n\r\nMuslim   community   here  that   there   has   been\r\n\r\nconsiderable  laxity  in the administration  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim law of marriage and divorce. There is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  conflict of jurisdiction between  the  Kathis,\r\n\r\nand  there is a tendency, perhaps not unnatural, for\r\n\r\na Kathi to register a divorce rather than to attempt\r\n\r\nto  effect a reconciliation between the parties; nor\r\n\r\nhas there been adequate supervision of the Kathis by\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar of Muslim Marriages. It has therefore\r\n\r\nlong  been recommended that fresh legislation should\r\n\r\nbe  introduced  to establish Muslim Courts  for  the\r\n\r\nbetter  administration of the Muslim law of marriage\r\n\r\nand  divorce,  and the necessary legislation  is,  1\r\n\r\nhope, provided in this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill repeals the present law - the Muslims\r\n\r\nOrdinance  (Chapter 57) - and, while re-enacting  many\r\n\r\nof  its provisions, makes provision in addition  for\r\n\r\nthe  appointment  of, firstly, a  Chief  Kathi  with\r\n\r\njurisdiction over the whole of Singapore and certain\r\n\r\nspecial  powers; and, secondly, for the  appointment\r\n\r\nof  a  Shariah Court under the Registrar  of  Muslim\r\n\r\nMarriages who is himself to be a Muslim, with  power\r\n\r\nto  determine  issues  between Muslims  relating  to\r\n\r\nmarriage and divorce in connected matters, and  with\r\n\r\npower  to  hear  appeals from the decisions  of  the\r\n\r\nKathi; and, thirdly, it provides for the appointment\r\n\r\nof  an Appeal Board to hear appeals from the Shariah\r\n\r\nCourt.   There  are  certain  particular  provisions\r\n\r\nwhich,  I think, perhaps could better be dealt  with\r\n\r\nat the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles of this Bill, I am assured, are\r\n\r\nwarmly welcomed by the Muslim community and they are\r\n\r\nrecommended  by  the  Muslim  Advisory  Board.   The\r\n\r\ndetailed provisions of the Bill involve a number  of\r\n\r\npoints  of Muslim law and procedure, and even  after\r\n\r\nall   these   months   of   preparatory   work   and\r\n\r\nconsultation,  I  am still receiving representations\r\n\r\nfor amendments on points of detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay translation of the Bill has been\r\n\r\npublished, which I hope will enable persons, who are\r\n\r\nnot  able  to  understand the Bill  in  the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage   and  who  have  experience   and   expert\r\n\r\nknowledge  in this matter, to study it  and  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat if any one has any further comments to make  on\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  they  can  be sent  to  me  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible; for I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nam anxious that there should be no further avoidable\r\n\r\ndelay in enacting this piece of legislation which  I\r\n\r\nam sure is for the benefit of the Muslim community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the most practical way of finalising the\r\n\r\ndetails of the Bill will be to refer it to a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  this House. This will have  one  very\r\n\r\nparticular  advantage in that the  Select  Committee\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to hear evidence from experts  should\r\n\r\nthere be any particular point of difficulty on which\r\n\r\ndoubts have to be resolved.

I  am\r\n\r\nglad that the Hon. the Chief Secretary has very ably\r\n\r\nput his points before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to speak on the principle of the Bill.\r\n\r\nAs far as the registration of marriages and divorces\r\n\r\namong  Muslims and the establishment  of  a  Shariah\r\n\r\nCourt are concerned, I wonder if any one would  want\r\n\r\nto  postpone  these  for even a single  minute,  but\r\n\r\nclause 47 is something very new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-known lawyer Mr N.

But  if  a\r\n\r\nMuslim has left a will - and this is a Colony and  not\r\n\r\na Muslim state, in which there should be freedom for\r\n\r\nany  individual  to  make  a  will  in  any  way  he\r\n\r\nlikes - then  he should not be interfered  with.

Members are aware, this Bill deals with the\r\n\r\nfate  of  a  particular community. For a  long  time\r\n\r\nnow - in fact, for decades - Muslim leaders in Singapore\r\n\r\nhave bemoaned the fact that there are no laws in the\r\n\r\nstatute  book  of  this island which  are  effective\r\n\r\nenough to deal with the growing complexities of  the\r\n\r\nway of life of the Muslim people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill deals with two main aspects of Islamic\r\n\r\nlaw. The first affects the ques-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntion of marriages and divorces, and the second deals\r\n\r\nwith  the question of inheritance. Although  in  the\r\n\r\npast  the  Muslims of Singapore have been guided  by\r\n\r\nthe laws of the Koran, there are no means within the\r\n\r\nconcept  of our existing laws by which these Koranic\r\n\r\nlaws  could be effectively carried out. As a result,\r\n\r\nthere  has been a considerable degree of abuse.  One\r\n\r\nhas  only to read the statistics of Muslim marriages\r\n\r\nand  divorces in Singapore to realise the  magnitude\r\n\r\nof  this  problem. The Hon. the Chief Secretary  has\r\n\r\ngiven  us figures for 1953, but I can quote you  the\r\n\r\nlatest  figures  on Muslim marriages  and  divorces,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  for  the year 1955, where the  number  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  marriages totalled 2,472, and the number  of\r\n\r\ndivorces 1,247.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This state of affairs creates other problems as\r\n\r\nwell. Children born out of these marriages are  left\r\n\r\nwithout  one  or  the  other of  their  parents  and\r\n\r\ninvariably  without  the means of  subsistence.  The\r\n\r\nreasons are obvious. Divorces are apparently made so\r\n\r\neasy when husbands realise that the decisions of the\r\n\r\nKathis in respect of alimony and maintenance are not\r\n\r\neasily enforceable. It is to right these wrongs that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill is now before us. I hope Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  will  give their fullest support  to  this\r\n\r\npiece of legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G.

In those days before the war, the\r\n\r\nproblem  was  not as grave as it is today.

We hope to have further\r\n\r\nemployer/employee  legislation  and  to  introduce\r\n\r\nefficient means of avoiding unnecessary strikes  and\r\n\r\nproviding better machinery for mediation without  in\r\n\r\nany  way depriving the worker of the ultimate weapon\r\n\r\nof the strike to be used in extreme cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, Sir, we are looking forward to measures\r\n\r\nto impose provisions of basic standards of living to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  worker in conditions compatible  with\r\n\r\nthe dignity of a human being and with .our financial\r\n\r\nresources.  But  of all these measures,  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\nproudest  of this motion which I have the  privilege\r\n\r\nof  moving in this House today, and I move it,  Sir,\r\n\r\nin  all  humility, not as Chief Minister but as  the\r\n\r\nelected  representative of the people of  Cairnhill.\r\n\r\nThis  is not a Government measure. There will be  no\r\n\r\nWhip,  Sir, on our side of the House. Every  man  in\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front and every one of our colleagues  of\r\n\r\nthe Alliance will speak from his heart and according\r\n\r\nto  his conscience. The principle of this measure is\r\n\r\none which has guided and which will always guide the\r\n\r\nconduct  of this Government and which, I hope,  will\r\n\r\nguide  the conduct of all future governments of  the\r\n\r\nterritory of Singapore.

The silver tongue of our friend,\r\n\r\nMr  Yap Pheng Geck, was otherwise engaged.  But  to\r\n\r\nany  one,  Sir, who sought to look beyond the  black\r\n\r\npall  of colonialism to our problems when we finally\r\n\r\nare  able  to  live our own lives, the  problem  was\r\n\r\nobvious and monumental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore are a conglomeration of several\r\n\r\nfully   developed  races  living  in   culture-tight\r\n\r\ncompartments under the dead hand of colonialism. All\r\n\r\nAsian communities suffer equal injustice under  that\r\n\r\nregime, but once colonialism is lifted off our necks\r\n\r\nand  we are able to lift up our heads, where  do  we\r\n\r\nseek  equal justice? Equal justice for all races  we\r\n\r\nmust have, Sir, or else the agony will be worse  and\r\n\r\ncertainly no better than that through which we  have\r\n\r\npassed  and through which we are passing.  Today  we\r\n\r\nlive under the domination of one race. What does  it\r\n\r\nbenefit  us  to  change masters and live  under  the\r\n\r\ndomination of a different race? To live fully and to\r\n\r\nbe  free,  there  must  be  an  end  to  all  racial\r\n\r\ndomination,  whether  European  or  Asian.   It   is\r\n\r\nessential  that the foundation be laid  whereby  all\r\n\r\nraces will be equal partners in the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language, Sir, has been and is an instrument of\r\n\r\nracial culture. To impose one language on the  whole\r\n\r\npopulation is to impose the domination of  that  one\r\n\r\nrace.  In  this plural society of ours, if  we  seek\r\n\r\njustice for all, we must reject mono-lingualism  and\r\n\r\naccept  the principle of multi-lingualism. We  must,\r\n\r\nSir,  give  equal respect to as many  of  the  major\r\n\r\nlanguages as meet the essential needs of the people.\r\n\r\nI  am  advised  and  I  believe that  Mandarin  will\r\n\r\nsatisfy our Chinese people of all dialects.  I  know\r\n\r\nthat  Malay will satisfy our Malays and Indonesians.\r\n\r\nI   believe  that  Tamil  will  satisfy  our  Indian\r\n\r\ndomiciled  community, and English will  satisfy  the\r\n\r\nEurasians,  the domiciled Europeans, of  whom  there\r\n\r\nare a few, and other English-speaking groups. Sir, I\r\n\r\nam not unconscious that, in this fascinating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncity  of  ours,  we have many other races  and  many\r\n\r\nother languages but like true Singaporeans, they are\r\n\r\nreasonable and they realise their small numbers and,\r\n\r\nby  virtue of the progressively growing difficulties\r\n\r\nof  additional languages, it would be impossible  to\r\n\r\ngive  consideration to more than four  languages.  I\r\n\r\nask this Assembly therefore that we should recognise\r\n\r\nthe  four  principal  cultures of  this  country  by\r\n\r\naccepting as official languages for oral debate  the\r\n\r\nfour principal languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the matter was broached to the Secretary\r\n\r\nof  State  for the Colonies, he sought to  draw  our\r\n\r\nattention, in a friendly way, to the many  technical\r\n\r\ndifficulties  implied in such  a  procedure,  and  I\r\n\r\nfreely confessed to him, \"Of course, we are going to\r\n\r\nhave  difficulties.\"  I  anticipate  that  for  many\r\n\r\nyears,  Sir,  our service for translations  will  be\r\n\r\ninadequate to cope with keeping our records in other\r\n\r\nthan  one language. I anticipate that when  we  have\r\n\r\nMinisters  who do not speak English, they will  have\r\n\r\nto  have  highly  qualified  personal  interpreters,\r\n\r\nperhaps more than one to each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  anticipate  that we will have some difficulty  in\r\n\r\ngetting highly trained interpreters who have  to  do\r\n\r\nsimultaneous interpretation, which is an  art,  Sir.\r\n\r\nWe will unquestionably lose something of the nuances\r\n\r\nin  debate  and  I  fear that, for  the  non-English\r\n\r\nspeaking, they are going to lose a lot of the fun of\r\n\r\nthe interruptions of the hon.

Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> But, Sir, these are minor\r\n\r\ndifficulties and if they were all, I for  one  would\r\n\r\nsleep   peacefully.  But  I  think  that  we  should\r\n\r\nrecognise there are more than difficulties. There is\r\n\r\none   danger - a  grave  danger - involved   in   multi-lingualism and we should face it. Language has  been\r\n\r\ntraditionally the principal unifying factor  in  the\r\n\r\nformation of nations. How are we, with equal respect\r\n\r\nfor  four  parallel cultures and four languages,  to\r\n\r\nform  one  nation?  Are we going to  build  up  four\r\n\r\nwarring groups in a pocket handkerchief area? I  am,\r\n\r\nSir,  all too conscious of the explosive content  in\r\n\r\nlinguistic conflict. I think hon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  are aware that but recently we have watched\r\n\r\nwith  anguish the riots which have taken a  toll  of\r\n\r\nmore   than   two  hundred - week-long  riots - in   the\r\n\r\nPresidency  of Bombay - where the Chief  Minister,  by\r\n\r\nthe way, is one of the strongest and one of the most\r\n\r\nexperienced  politicians I have  ever  met - and  they\r\n\r\nrose,  Sir,  out  of  linguistic  conflict.   I   am\r\n\r\nconscious  of,  and I think other hon.  Members  are\r\n\r\nfully  aware and watching with concern, the  growing\r\n\r\ntension   in   Ceylon  arising  out  of   linguistic\r\n\r\nconflict.  Is  this going to happen  here?  Are  our\r\n\r\nracial  cultures going to develop so selfishly  once\r\n\r\nthey  are  freed from colonial restraint?  Are  they\r\n\r\ngoing  to bring destruction instead of construction?\r\n\r\nThat is the danger - a very real danger. Is there  any\r\n\r\nprecedent  for such an experiment as  that  which  I\r\n\r\nseek to ask hon. Members to embark on? I have sought\r\n\r\nto  find an analogy, Sir, and the nearest I can find\r\n\r\nis that in Switzerland where they have four national\r\n\r\nlanguages - German, French, Italian and Romanish - and\r\n\r\nwhere,  despite  the  diversity  of  languages   and\r\n\r\ncultures, they have a united nation. It is true that\r\n\r\nthey are racially not as diverse as we are here  but\r\n\r\nthere,   there  is  an  example  of  unity   despite\r\n\r\nlinguistic  and cultural diversity. Can we  hope  to\r\n\r\nproduce, Sir, men of sober political sense,  men  of\r\n\r\ncool judgment who will maintain peace and racial co-operation and harmony, as is done in Switzerland?  I\r\n\r\nsay  we  must have faith. I have faith, Sir. I  have\r\n\r\nlived  here since my birth and I have faith  in  the\r\n\r\nextraordinary adaptability, the resilience  and  the\r\n\r\nfriendliness of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one doubt. Neither the Swiss nor any other\r\n\r\nnation  that I know of in similar circumstances  had\r\n\r\nto  cope  simultaneously  with  Communist  and  pro-Communist  activities. Here  in  Singapore  we  have\r\n\r\nwatched  them and it is true that wherever there  is\r\n\r\nany  question  of disagreement, wherever  they  can\r\n\r\ndestroy  stability, wherever they can seek  falsely,\r\n\r\nmaliciously,  by  extortion or  otherwise,  to  bring\r\n\r\ndisrepute  upon established organisations,  wherever\r\n\r\nthere  are  little disagreements racially  which  we\r\n\r\nwould, in the normal course, if in Switzerland or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelsewhere, without these infernal people, have  come\r\n\r\nto  a  friendly conclusion, these disagreements  are\r\n\r\ntortured  and  whipped  up by their  Communists  and\r\n\r\ntheir  friends with one end in view - and that is  the\r\n\r\ndestruction  of stability, an attempt  to  keep  the\r\n\r\ncountry  constantly off-balance  in  the  hope  that\r\n\r\nultimately  the  accumulation  of  their   carefully\r\n\r\nplanned campaign of bitterness would one day blow up\r\n\r\ninto  chaos  and  give them and their  comrades  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of having Commissars. We are  conscious\r\n\r\nthat   these   forces  are  not   without   men   of\r\n\r\nintelligence,  are unscrupulous, and not  themselves\r\n\r\nideologically inclined but seeking to ride the band-wagon that they think will lead them to success - self-interest. The sympathizers are the dangers. We  have\r\n\r\nseen  the  Communist forces and how they work  under\r\n\r\nthe cloak of democracy during the time of the Public\r\n\r\nSecurity  Bill, and we will see more of them.  Sir,\r\n\r\ncan  we  in  Singapore with this element  constantly\r\n\r\ntrying  to keep us off-balance maintain the  balance\r\n\r\nnecessary, the racial harmony without which  we  are\r\n\r\ndestroyed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is being asked to undertake an\r\n\r\nexperiment   no  other  country  has  attempted   in\r\n\r\ncircumstances without analogy anywhere. But what  is\r\n\r\nthe  alternative? The alternative, Sir, is to adopt,\r\n\r\nand  perhaps adapt, the existing colonial system  and\r\n\r\nmake English, and perhaps Malay, just as a sop,  the\r\n\r\nofficial languages. Would that work? I have  sought,\r\n\r\nSir, within my abilities, which I do not pretend are\r\n\r\nextensive, with some of the experience that  I  have\r\n\r\ngained in the last ten months to assess that, and  I\r\n\r\nsay that, in my own view, Sir, we could survive with\r\n\r\nthe  help  of  the bayonet and the bullet  in  those\r\n\r\ncircumstances  for  about three to  four  years  and\r\n\r\nthereafter   the  forces  of  cultural  and   racial\r\n\r\nfrustration   of  the  servient  communities   would\r\n\r\nexplode  this island like a burst hand-grenade.  Are\r\n\r\nwe  to  sell,  Sir,  the  possibility - and  it  is  a\r\n\r\npossibility - of a glori-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nous  and  harmonious  future of  unity  between  all\r\n\r\nraces,  of the success of this unique experiment  in\r\n\r\nthese  unique  difficult circumstances?  Are  we  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice  them for a few years of uneasy peace  and\r\n\r\nthereafter certain extinction? That would be the act\r\n\r\nof  a coward. I believe we must have the courage  to\r\n\r\nface  the  tribulations  of  growth  along  natural,\r\n\r\nhonest lines. Inter-racial tribulations, let  us  be\r\n\r\nfrank, I fear there will be, but I believe Singapore\r\n\r\nwill,   because  Singapore  must,  produce  men   of\r\n\r\nstature, respected leaders of the various races with\r\n\r\nimmense   patience,  immense  tact   and   unlimited\r\n\r\ngoodwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fully conscious, gravely conscious of the\r\n\r\ndangers inherent in this motion and the grave effect\r\n\r\nof  its alternative, I ask the House to move forward\r\n\r\ntowards  an  honest era, because the  acceptance  of\r\n\r\nthis motion is the acceptance of the cornerstone  of\r\n\r\nall  legislation for our future - the  principle,  now\r\n\r\nand forever, of equal justice for all races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
