The  House was also  informed  that\r\n\r\npending  implementation of the new salary  scales\r\n\r\non  the  1st  of April this year, Government  had\r\n\r\ndecided  that the Junior Officers and  Constables\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  with effect from  the  1st  of\r\n\r\nNovember,  1971, an interim allowance of  10  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  salary  and  of all  allowances  drawn,\r\n\r\nexcept   Public  Utilities  Board   and   Housing\r\n\r\nAllowances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce that Government has\r\n\r\naccepted   in   principle  most  of   the   other\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  the Lee  Soo  Ann  Committee\r\n\r\nReport.  Officials of my Ministry and the Finance\r\n\r\nMinistry have been working closely together and a\r\n\r\nformula of conversion has now been worked out and\r\n\r\napproved  by Government. The new total emoluments\r\n\r\nwill be computed on the following basis:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n              Salary as at 1-4-72\r\n\r\n                       +\r\n\r\n           Allowances to be abolished\r\n\r\n                       +\r\n\r\n       Interim  allowance of 10  per  cent\r\n\r\n       (made up of 10 per cent  of  salary \r\n\r\n       and of all allowances drawn, except \r\n\r\n       P.U.B, and Housing Allowances)\r\n\r\n       Convert to the nearest higher point \r\n\r\n       in the new scale\r\n\r\n                       +\r\n\r\n           Increment credits(if any)\r\n\r\n                       +\r\n\r\n      Allowances to be retained (if any).\r\n\r\n</pre> \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  conversion  will come  into  effect  on  1st\r\n\r\nApril,  1972, and, as from that date, payment  of\r\n\r\nthe 10 per cent interim allowance will cease.

Of the  800  men\r\n\r\nwho  do  not  have the Secondary II or specialist\r\n\r\nqualifications,   340  would  be   eligible   for\r\n\r\nretirement in the normal course of events  before\r\n\r\n1st July, 1974.

Retirement under this provision\r\n\r\ngives an enhanced pension factor of One over five\r\n\r\nhundred   (1/500)   of   an   officer's    annual\r\n\r\npensionable emoluments for each complete month of\r\n\r\npensionable  service, as compared  to  a  pension\r\n\r\nfactor  of  one over six hundred (1/600)  for  an\r\n\r\nofficer  who  retires in normal circumstances  on\r\n\r\naccount of age or for medical reasons. It is  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  Government that the retirement  of\r\n\r\nthese  460 men will be so phased out that  actual\r\n\r\nretirement will commence on 1st April, 1973,  and\r\n\r\nbe  completed by 30th June, 1974. Those  who  are\r\n\r\nphysically  fit  will be offered employment  with\r\n\r\nthe  Guard  and Escort Unit, which will  by  then\r\n\r\nhave been reorganised into a statutory board  and\r\n\r\nrun   on  commercial  lines,  if  they  take   up\r\n\r\nemployment with this statutory board,  they  will\r\n\r\nbe  eligible, in addition to their pensions,  for\r\n\r\nthe  full salary paid by the board.

The  Registrar of  Societies  has  not\r\n\r\ntaken action against dormant political parties and\r\n\r\nthose  which have not complied with the  Societies\r\n\r\nAct.  In  view  of the fact that the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nSocieties  has sufficient powers to  remove  dead-wood political organisations, there is no need  to\r\n\r\namend  the Societies Act to provide him with  such\r\n\r\npower.  In any case, there are politicians outside\r\n\r\nthis Parliament who do not share the same down-to-earth views about dormant political parties as the\r\n\r\nMember for Changi. They believe in flogging a dead\r\n\r\nhorse  to  life  oblivious  of  past  records   of\r\n\r\nundistinguished performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singapore becoming a museum of political\r\n\r\nparties,  I am afraid this is part of history.  As\r\n\r\nto  the  possibility of confusing  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore because of the large number of political\r\n\r\nparties,   I   submit,  our   electorate   is   an\r\n\r\nintelligent electorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

Can the Minister explain to\r\n\r\nthe House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> The reason is very simple.\r\n\r\nWe  do  hope that there will be some other  people\r\n\r\nwho would like to revive dormant political parties\r\n\r\nand save them the bother of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In view of the explanation, I\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1151*.(* The same amendment also stood in the, names of Messrs Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi, J. F. Conceicao  and P. Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, Sir, I wish to speak on\r\n\r\nthe  Police Force. You will recall that during the\r\n\r\ndebate  on last year's Budget, I pointed out  that\r\n\r\nsome  constables and Police officers were rude  to\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public. At that  time  the  then\r\n\r\nMinister  expressed concern over  this  issue  and\r\n\r\npromised to take appropriate action to rectify the\r\n\r\nposition.  I  am  glad  to note  that  since  then\r\n\r\nmembers of the Police Force have shown a new style\r\n\r\nof  behaviour in carrying out their services.  The\r\n\r\nPolice have been very active in some campaigns  to\r\n\r\nbring  about a better public understanding of  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force. For example, during Police Week they\r\n\r\nhave  put  up  road  safety  exhibitions  in   the\r\n\r\ncommunity   centres  to  bring  about   a   better\r\n\r\nrelationship  and an improvement  in  co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween the people and the Police, and to make the\r\n\r\npeople  understand that the policeman is a  friend\r\n\r\nof  the people. These are some achievements  which\r\n\r\nare  praiseworthy. Undoubtedly a  rapport  between\r\n\r\nthe  Police  and  the  people  is  meaningful   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  because  this, will  promote  the  co-operation  between  the  people  and  the  Police,\r\n\r\nthereby  enabling  the Police  Force  to  be  more\r\n\r\neffective   in  crime  prevention  and  detection.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the interests of the public, I wish to\r\n\r\nbring up two points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Police Week should be held annually\r\n\r\nin  order  to continue to improve the relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the people and the Police. It is only when\r\n\r\nthere  is  co-operation between them that  we  can\r\n\r\nhope  to  achieve  greater  stability  and  better\r\n\r\nsocial  order  in our country so that  our  people\r\n\r\nwill be able to live in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in recruiting Police officers we must\r\n\r\nrecruit more citizens. Sir, the Minister has  said\r\n\r\nin a Statement earlier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  that there has been a considerable improvement\r\n\r\nin the remuneration of Police officers. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  should think that this new salary structure  is\r\n\r\nenough attraction to Singapore youths to join  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force. If this should fail to attract  our\r\n\r\nown  youths, then we have to make a further review\r\n\r\nand  to study the causes. I would also like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister concerned how many non-citizens have\r\n\r\nbeen recruited into the Police Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan) (in Malay):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has launched several campaigns, such as\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Safety Campaign, Pedestrian Safety\r\n\r\nCampaign  and Road Safety Campaign. To ensure  the\r\n\r\nsafety  of members of the public on the roads  and\r\n\r\nto  prevent  them  from accidents  which  are,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  avoidable, several road  safety  measures\r\n\r\nhave  been  provided and a lot of money  spent  on\r\n\r\nthem.  For  example, overhead  bridges  have  been\r\n\r\nconstructed  and zebra crossing lines  painted  on\r\n\r\nthe  roads.  All  these  are  for  the  safety  of\r\n\r\npedestrians. But such campaigns and measures  will\r\n\r\nbe  meaningless if all kinds of road users, either\r\n\r\npedestrians,  motorists or motor  cyclists,  still\r\n\r\nmeet with accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One contribution to road accidents is that\r\n\r\nchildren  are allowed to fly their kites  anywhere\r\n\r\nthey like. Sometimes these kite flyers can be seen\r\n\r\nby  the  roadsides, running across roads,  and  in\r\n\r\nmany  other places which are dangerous. This is  a\r\n\r\nhazard to motorists and, apart from accidents that\r\n\r\ncan happen to them, the kite flyers themselves can\r\n\r\nbe  knocked down by cars. The time has  come  for\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner of Police to take firm  measures\r\n\r\nagainst these kite flyers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, how many\r\n\r\npolicemen  have resigned from the Force?  Quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber,  I  think;  enough to  create  a  staffing\r\n\r\nproblem that can be described as critical.  May  I\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister concerned why has this  problem\r\n\r\nbeen allowed to deteriorate to such a state? Is it\r\n\r\nbecause of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlack  of  esprit de corps in the Force? Or  is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  of the bullying attitudes of the superior\r\n\r\nofficers who, in the execution of their duty,  may\r\n\r\ntend  to  be highhanded, or is it because  of  the\r\n\r\npoor  pay structure? The Minister has announced  a\r\n\r\nnew pay structure for the Police Force, and it  is\r\n\r\nmost probable that Police officers will welcome it\r\n\r\nvery much. Therefore, I hope they will work harder\r\n\r\nin future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago we heard of a few Police officers\r\n\r\nwho were sacked and then reinstated all because of\r\n\r\na  few missing Playboy magazines, which are banned\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Why was it that no action was taken\r\n\r\nagainst the person who was in possession of  those\r\n\r\nbad  magazines?  Can it be said  that  the  action\r\n\r\nagainst these four poor Police officers could have\r\n\r\na  demoralising  effect in the Police  Force,  and\r\n\r\nthereby causing some to resign?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that the Police Force\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be  modernised and reorganised  but\r\n\r\nthose  responsible  for the reorganisation  should\r\n\r\ntake  the humane values into consideration. I hope\r\n\r\nthat  in  the computerisation of the Police  Force\r\n\r\nthe policemen will not exist as mere digits in the\r\n\r\nminds of those responsible for the reorganisation.\r\n\r\nThe  chances of promotion in the Republic's Police\r\n\r\nForce  should not only be given to people  holding\r\n\r\nrequisite qualifications, but equal chances should\r\n\r\nalso  be given to those with long service and with\r\n\r\ngood records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask why at present the traffic is in a\r\n\r\nchaotic  state?  What  is the  number  of  traffic\r\n\r\npolicemen at present in the Force, and how many of\r\n\r\nthem  are on traffic duty at any one time? Why  is\r\n\r\nit  a  common sight in Singapore's roads  to  find\r\n\r\ntraffic  policemen on duty in pairs, in threes  or\r\n\r\nin  fours?  It is time that more traffic policemen\r\n\r\nwere  on  foot  duty at junctions of  busy  roads,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in narrow lanes where  most  of  the\r\n\r\ntraffic offences are committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, please permit me to ask the Minister\r\n\r\na question. This is in relation to the security\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the Central Fish Market in Jurong. The Central\r\n\r\nFish  Market in Jurong is the only venue  for  the\r\n\r\nauction  of  fresh  fish. Every day  thousands  of\r\n\r\npeople  do  their  fish business in  this  market.\r\n\r\nBecause of the great number of people entering and\r\n\r\nleaving the market, it is inevitable that some bad\r\n\r\nhats mingle themselves with the crowd. As a result\r\n\r\nthere  have  been cases of fighting, Xamb1ing  and\r\n\r\ntheft in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received complaints from the fish\r\n\r\nmerchants  in the market to the effect  that  over\r\n\r\nthe past few months the security of the market has\r\n\r\ndeteriorated. There has been an increasing  number\r\n\r\nof thefts in the market. Fish packed in crates are\r\n\r\nsimply stolen. For every crate of fish stolen  the\r\n\r\nfishmonger loses about $100 to $200. If  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncrate  of  prawns,  then the loss  will  be  about\r\n\r\n$1,000.  Those  fish merchants who  were  affected\r\n\r\nhave  reported the cases to the Police,  but  were\r\n\r\ntold  that they could not do anything. I  am  told\r\n\r\nthat  usually  the  theft  occurs  before  auction\r\n\r\nbegins. This is the time when the businessmen  are\r\n\r\nso  busily occupied with the preparations for  the\r\n\r\nauction that the thieves move in. I would like  to\r\n\r\nask   the  Minister  whether  he  can  send   some\r\n\r\npolicemen  there between the hours of  10.00  p.m.\r\n\r\nand  2.00  a.m, to maintain order and security  in\r\n\r\nthe fish market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, first let me say how\r\n\r\nmuch  I  appreciate the statement from the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang that the Police Force has  improved\r\n\r\nin  its  courtesy to the public. I am very pleased\r\n\r\nto  hear  that.  The Member has  also  raised  the\r\n\r\nquestion that we should, in fact, make the  Police\r\n\r\nWeek  an  annual affair. The Ministry has this  in\r\n\r\nmind,  and will certainly give the proposal  every\r\n\r\nserious  consideration. I am also very pleased  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  the  series of 12 Police  Week  shows,\r\n\r\nwhich  began  last year and will continue  in  the\r\n\r\npresent year, have produced the desired effect  of\r\n\r\nestablishing  a  better relationship  between  the\r\n\r\nPolice  and the public. The House can rest assured\r\n\r\nthat the Police Force will be instructed that good\r\n\r\nPolice relationship is not just a matter of Police\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshows. This   should  be  a   continuing   daily\r\n\r\nexperience between the Police and the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also raised the question\r\n\r\nof  the recruitment of non-citizens. I think  what\r\n\r\nhe  has  in  mind is the recruitment of Malaysians\r\n\r\ninto  the  Police Force. The reason  for  this  is\r\n\r\nsimply  that  under  the previous  salary  scales,\r\n\r\nbefore the present revision recommended by the Lee\r\n\r\nSoo Ann Report, it was found impossible to recruit\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens into the Police  Force.  I  do\r\n\r\nshare his hope that with the improvement in salary\r\n\r\nscales  and also the conditions of work,  we  will\r\n\r\nhave more Singaporeans applying to join the Police\r\n\r\nForce in our next recruitment exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member has also asked for the\r\n\r\nfigures  of Malaysians recruited. I am  unable  to\r\n\r\ngive him the exact figure, but if he wishes he can\r\n\r\nask  an  Oral  Question  later.  If  he  will   be\r\n\r\nsatisfied with a rough figure, it is in the region\r\n\r\nof  600.  I would like to add that the recruitment\r\n\r\nof  foreigners is only an interim measure, and  we\r\n\r\nhope  that in the future we do not have to recruit\r\n\r\npeople  from  outside Singapore  to  fill  up  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  public  safety,  particularly   with\r\n\r\nregard to kite-flying. Under section 14 (e) of the\r\n\r\nMinor Offences Act (Chapter 102), it is an offence\r\n\r\nfor  any  person to fly a kite which obstructs  or\r\n\r\ninterferes with the traffic in any public road  or\r\n\r\nwith  the use of telephones wires. The flying  of\r\n\r\nkites is a seasonal past-time indulged in by young\r\n\r\nand old throughout the Republic. I believe it is a\r\n\r\ncommon feature in the Geylang Serai area. However,\r\n\r\nto-date there has been no occasion for the  Police\r\n\r\nto  take action against these persons because they\r\n\r\nhave   not  obstructed  or  interfered  with   the\r\n\r\ntraffic,  and  there  has  been  no  complaint  of\r\n\r\ntelephone  wires having been damaged.  The  danger\r\n\r\narising  from this past-time is caused by children\r\n\r\nrunning after kites that have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen cut loose. I can assure the Member that  the\r\n\r\nPolice  will do all it can to prevent  any  hazard\r\n\r\narising out of flying of kites, and I do hope that\r\n\r\nthe  Member will also urge people who wish to  fly\r\n\r\nkites to be more careful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also a few questions raised by the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson. I believe he wanted to know  how\r\n\r\nmany  policemen have resigned, and I can give  him\r\n\r\nthe  figures. The number of resignations of junior\r\n\r\nofficers was 122 for 1969, 246 for 1970,  and  235\r\n\r\nfor  1971. From the beginning of this year to  the\r\n\r\n15th March, 1972, there were only 12 resignations.\r\n\r\nFor  senior  officers, the number of  resignations\r\n\r\nwas  12  for 1969, 19 for 1970, and 24  for  1971.\r\n\r\nFrom  the  beginning of this year  till  the  20th\r\n\r\nMarch, 1972, there were only nine resignations.  I\r\n\r\nthink the House is fully aware of the reasons  for\r\n\r\nthe  resignations, namely, the salary  scales  and\r\n\r\nthe  conditions of work. All this has been removed\r\n\r\nby  the recommendations of the Lee Soo Ann Report,\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government has accepted in principle.\r\n\r\nIt  is  hoped that with the improvements in salary\r\n\r\nscales and conditions of work, there will be  less\r\n\r\nresignations in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Anson is also concerned\r\n\r\nwith the state of traffic in Singapore. If I heard\r\n\r\nhim   correctly,  he  described  it  as   chaotic.\r\n\r\nAlthough  traffic  on  our  roads  appears  to  be\r\n\r\napparently chaotic, it is, in fact, not so.  There\r\n\r\nare  two  vivid patterns in the flow of traffic  -\r\n\r\ninto the city in the morning peak, and out of  the\r\n\r\ncity  in  the evening peak. During these  periods,\r\n\r\nthe  flow of traffic is congested, and I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that this congestion must have given rise to\r\n\r\nthe  impression  that  the  flow  of  traffic   is\r\n\r\nchaotic.  With more vehicles on the  roads  during\r\n\r\npeak  hours, the journeys to and from work  create\r\n\r\ngreat demands on road space and certain delays are\r\n\r\ninevitably   experienced.   This   is   a   common\r\n\r\noccurrence not only in Singapore, but in  all  big\r\n\r\ncities  in the world. The Government is trying  to\r\n\r\novercome   some   of  the  problems   of   traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  by making improvements to the  network\r\n\r\nof roads and to traffic management\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  enforcement schemes. It is also relevant  for\r\n\r\nme  to  point out that normally we do  not  deploy\r\n\r\nthree or four traffic policemen on traffic duty in\r\n\r\none  spot, except in places where we have recently\r\n\r\nintroduced the box junction system. I quite  agree\r\n\r\nthat we do need more traffic policemen, but I hope\r\n\r\nthat as all the vacancies in the rank and file are\r\n\r\nfilled, the position will be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of\r\n\r\nsecurity in the Central Fish Market in Jurong.  As\r\n\r\nthis  matter has just been pointed out  to  me,  I\r\n\r\nwill  certainly  look into  it  to  see  that  the\r\n\r\nsituation is improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

A nation enacts laws in  order\r\n\r\nto  maintain order in its society. However, if the\r\n\r\nenforcement of the law is ineffective,  or  worse,\r\n\r\nif  the  law  is abused, there will be  disharmony\r\n\r\namong  members  of the family and they  will  lose\r\n\r\nconfidence  in the enforcers of the law.  If  this\r\n\r\ngoes on, the law will be flouted and in the end it\r\n\r\nwill  be very difficult to maintain law and  order\r\n\r\nin  the  society. If I may use a colloquial phrase\r\n\r\nit is like an entanglement of the strands of jute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are like social animals. They live\r\n\r\ntogether  but  because of civilisation  they  have\r\n\r\nadvanced  both socially and materially. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwith   the  rising  desire  and  expectation   for\r\n\r\nprogress they have differed in their mental  make-up.  This,  together with the different levels  of\r\n\r\neducation  that they receive, we find  that  there\r\n\r\nare  the capable and the incapable, the stupid and\r\n\r\nthe  intelligent. Therefore, even in a very simple\r\n\r\nsociety, there is bound to be a certain number  of\r\n\r\npeople  who are evil-doers. Among them  there  are\r\n\r\nthose  who  have breached the law once  or  twice,\r\n\r\nwhile   there  are  others  who  are  incorrigible\r\n\r\ncriminals. They break the law in order to  achieve\r\n\r\ntheir ulterior motives. They try to create trouble\r\n\r\nand  cause  chaos. The Government,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the interests of the people, has to  set\r\n\r\nup  police stations, and send policemen and  other\r\n\r\nofficers  in  plain-clothes for patrol  duties  to\r\n\r\nprevent these evil-doers from breaking the law and\r\n\r\nto help the people to cope with emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some members of the public in my\r\n\r\nconstituency  have complained to  me  that  people\r\n\r\nhave been wrongly arrested and beaten up by plain-clothes    officers.   I    have    carried    out\r\n\r\ninvestigations into such complaints and have found\r\n\r\nthem  to  be  true.  Hence, I would  like  to  say\r\n\r\nsomething about this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is said that whenever the\r\n\r\nPolice  arrest a suspect, he will first be  beaten\r\n\r\nup to be taught a lesson. Sometimes he has to make\r\n\r\na statement under duress. If this kind of approach\r\n\r\nis  used against proven gangsters, I would be  the\r\n\r\nlast  to object. On the contrary, I feel that more\r\n\r\nsevere punishment should be meted out against such\r\n\r\nbad  elements to stop them from doing bad  things.\r\n\r\nHowever, the indiscriminate beating-up of suspects\r\n\r\ncan   sometimes   involve  innocent   persons.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  feel  that whenever the  Police  arrest\r\n\r\ncertain    suspects,   they   should   first    be\r\n\r\ninterrogated and investigations made.  The  Police\r\n\r\nshould check their identity to find out whether or\r\n\r\nnot  they  have any previous criminal records.  If\r\n\r\nthey  have no records, then investigations  should\r\n\r\nbe carried out at the scene of the crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  if  the  suspects  are found  innocent,  they\r\n\r\nshould be released. If they are found guilty, they\r\n\r\nshould  be  duly dealt with. Those who are  guilty\r\n\r\nwill  not  resist  arrest,  and  will  submit   to\r\n\r\npunishment.  In  this way, the  innocent  will  be\r\n\r\nspared corporal punishment. It is important to see\r\n\r\nthat  there is justice in the enforcement  of  the\r\n\r\nlaw. Then the country as a whole will be peaceful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, plain-clothes Police officers\r\n\r\nare    charged   with   the   responsibility    of\r\n\r\nsafeguarding the peace of the country. They should\r\n\r\nnot  only  be  given privilege to  be  armed  with\r\n\r\nrevolvers  but also the privilege to use  them  in\r\n\r\nself-defence. However, the use of firearms  should\r\n\r\nonly  be  resorted to when they are in very  great\r\n\r\ndanger.  In  a normal situation the Police  should\r\n\r\nnot use firearms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be justice in the enforcement of law\r\n\r\nand  order.  This  will promote  a  close  rapport\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Police  and the  people.  We  should\r\n\r\neducate the people to be more friendly towards the\r\n\r\nPolice Force. To accomplish this, I feel that  all\r\n\r\nsuspects should be thoroughly interrogated  before\r\n\r\nany  action is taken against them. If this is  not\r\n\r\ndone,  there will be a miscarriage of justice  and\r\n\r\nthere  will  be hostility towards the  Police.  If\r\n\r\nsuspects  are  taken  to the Police  station,  and\r\n\r\nthere  are sufficient grounds to find them guilty,\r\n\r\nthey  should be charged accordingly.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will take note of what I  have  said  so\r\n\r\nthat  a  close rapport can be established  between\r\n\r\nthe Police and the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me\r\n\r\nfirst say that I share the views of the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar that law and order should be maintained\r\n\r\nand  that justice should not only be done  but  is\r\n\r\nseen to be done. The main thrust of his debate  is\r\n\r\nthat  some  plain-clothes officers have beaten  up\r\n\r\nsuspects  and  that he himself  has  conducted  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation  into the matter. I  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nMember's good intention. However, I would like  to\r\n\r\nsay that if there are any complaints, there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a  proper  procedure to  deal  with  them.  He\r\n\r\nhimself  has conducted an investigation,  but  the\r\n\r\nresults  of his investigation cannot be the  basis\r\n\r\nfor  disciplinary action. If he were  to  lodge  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint, and if it is found that what he says is\r\n\r\ntrue,  then  disciplinary  action  will  be  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  the  officers concerned. Police  officers\r\n\r\nare   not   above  the  law.  There  are  specific\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the Penal Code which  make  it  an\r\n\r\noffence for persons, including Police officers, to\r\n\r\nuse  force  of  any kind to extract confession  or\r\n\r\ninformation which may lead to the detection  of  a\r\n\r\ncrime. Any person so aggrieved by such action  can\r\n\r\nlodge  complaints against the officers  concerned,\r\n\r\nand    every    complaint   will   be   thoroughly\r\n\r\ninvestigated. If the investigation reveals that  a\r\n\r\nparticular   officer  is  at  fault,  disciplinary\r\n\r\nproceedings  will  be  taken  against   him.   Any\r\n\r\ninstance  of misconduct on the part of any  Police\r\n\r\nofficer  will not be condoned and will  always  be\r\n\r\nviewed  very seriously. Police brutality will  not\r\n\r\nbe  tolerated  even  if, after investigation,  the\r\n\r\nsuspect is found to have committed the offence. In\r\n\r\nfact,  if  a person is found to have committed  an\r\n\r\noffence,  the chances are that he will be  charged\r\n\r\nin  court. If the Member for Paya Lebar has lodged\r\n\r\na  specific  complaint, I am sure the Police  will\r\n\r\ncertainly look into the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  very  satisfied with the Minister's answer.

The  Vigilante  Corps   was\r\n\r\nactively discussed during the Committee of  Supply\r\n\r\nlast year. I do not propose, therefore, to go over\r\n\r\nthe  same ground which has been covered by Members\r\n\r\nlast  year.  I  merely wish to seek  clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs: who is really in charge of  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps, and whether there are any  plans\r\n\r\nto  re-activate the Volunteer Vigilante Corps  or,\r\n\r\nfor short, the V.V.C.? At present there are only a\r\n\r\nvery  few volunteers remaining in service and  the\r\n\r\nV.V.C, is, therefore, very inactive. Nowadays  we\r\n\r\nseldom  see them patrolling the streets or helping\r\n\r\nat  community centre functions or participating in\r\n\r\ncommunity     activities    in     the     various\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime ago, Members of\r\n\r\nParliament were asked to submit their views on the\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of the V.V.C, in their  respective\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  I  wonder what  conclusions  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  as  a  result of these suggestions  by\r\n\r\nMembers. Are there any plans to revive the  V.V.C.\r\n\r\nand  to make it play a more effective role in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the community? In my view, in order to\r\n\r\nachieve  this  the V.V.C, members  should  not  be\r\n\r\nconfined to guard duties only but should  also  be\r\n\r\nencouraged   to   participate   in   the   various\r\n\r\nactivities organised by the Citizens' Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees or by the management committees of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres in the various  constituencies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Citizens' Consultative Committees or\r\n\r\nthe management committees of the community centres\r\n\r\nshould  have a measure of control over the  V.V.C.\r\n\r\nmembers in their community centres. At present the\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders have first to  seek  permission\r\n\r\nbefore they can obtain the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices  of  the V.V.C.

The\r\n\r\nofficers have been very efficient in their  efforts\r\n\r\nto abolish drug trafficking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I regret to say that the people who were\r\n\r\nprosecuted for trafficking or peddling in MX  pills\r\n\r\nand   ganja  have  been  given  only  light  prison\r\n\r\nsentences. In the Straits Times dated 4th March, it\r\n\r\nwas  reported  that two persons were convicted  and\r\n\r\nfined  $150  each for possession of ganja.  In  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times of 22nd March, a labourer was  fined\r\n\r\n$25  for possession of ganja. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\npenalties given to these persons are very light  in\r\n\r\ncomparison  with the penalties for other  offences.\r\n\r\nThey  should  be given the maximum  penalty.  If  a\r\n\r\nperson  is  convicted for causing damage  to  other\r\n\r\npeople's  property  under the  Vandalism  Act,  the\r\n\r\nsentence  can  include the rotan.  Why  cannot  the\r\n\r\npunishment  by  the  rotan be extended  to  persons\r\n\r\ntrafficking  in MX pills and other  drugs?  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat the Minister for Home Affairs should amend the\r\n\r\nlaws  so  that these people will be given a heavier\r\n\r\npunishment,  such as a longer term of imprisonment,\r\n\r\nincluding caning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But  this has a bad effect on  the  human\r\n\r\nbody,  and will finally ruin the body. There is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  this  is bad and dangerous  for  their\r\n\r\nfuture. Therefore, the Government must take  action\r\n\r\non this serious matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also understand that hippism is associated\r\n\r\nwith drug-taking and if long hair is characteristic\r\n\r\nof  hippism, then it is time that we acted  on  our\r\n\r\nyoungsters who sport long hair. Even junior doctors\r\n\r\nhave long hair! We must check this trend because it\r\n\r\naffects  the society. We must destroy the poisoning\r\n\r\neffects  of  the demoralised Western society  being\r\n\r\naccepted  here  by  our local  youths  as  being  a\r\n\r\nfashionable thing. These youngsters who  keep  long\r\n\r\nhair  must  be pulled up and charged.  Parents  too\r\n\r\nshould do their part in discouraging their children\r\n\r\nfrom  keeping  long hair. It is very important  for\r\n\r\nthe Minister to take action on this matter. He must\r\n\r\nnot  prolong the matter. Otherwise our  youths  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  citizens of Singapore will be spoilt  in\r\n\r\nthe future.

The work of the Registry  has\r\n\r\nincreased  quite  a  lot.  We  all  know  that  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  citizenship has, over  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears, been debated enthusiastically by many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  in the House on behalf of the  people  in\r\n\r\nthe  various  constituencies. At  that  time,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs was a Backbencher and he\r\n\r\nwas  speaking  On  behalf of  the  people  in  his\r\n\r\nconstituency. He asked the Minister for Labour  to\r\n\r\nconsider more sympathetically the situation  faced\r\n\r\nby  the  people in his constituency. Allow  me  to\r\n\r\nquote  the  Member for Alexandra, who is  now  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs, when he spoke  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  This is in Hansard, Vol. 29, No. 12,  col.\r\n\r\n802, dated 20th March, 1970:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say how much I share the\r\n\r\nviews  of the Member for Toa Payoh on the question\r\n\r\nof eligibility of citizenship and the way by which\r\n\r\ncitizenship is granted to applicants? Speaking  on\r\n\r\nthe   basis  of  my  own  experience  in  my   own\r\n\r\nconstituency, I feel that, perhaps,  there  should\r\n\r\nbe  some relaxation and more compassionate ways in\r\n\r\nwhich    applications    for    citizenship    are\r\n\r\nconsidered.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason for quoting the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs'  statement  is  to  show  that   he   was\r\n\r\nsympathetic towards the people without citizenship\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was a Backbencher. Now that  he  is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs, I hope that  he  will\r\n\r\nconsider   the   question  of   citizenship   more\r\n\r\nsympathetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main reason why we impose a strict\r\n\r\npolicy  on  citizenship is to reduce the  economic\r\n\r\nburden  of our country. Of course, I support  this\r\n\r\nargument. But over the last year or so, there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  great  improvement in our economy  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  can well afford to relax our policy  on\r\n\r\nthe  granting  of citizenship. We have,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nissued  more  than  60,000 work  permits  to  non-citizens.  Therefore, for those  who  have  waited\r\n\r\nmany  years for their citizenship - some  of  them\r\n\r\nhave   their  families,  wives  and  children   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and they have long regarded Singapore as\r\n\r\ntheir  permanent residence or home -  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  more liberal and grant citizenship  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following the rapid economic expansion\r\n\r\nexperienced by our economy, the wage level of  our\r\n\r\nworkers has been increased. A semi-skilled  worker\r\n\r\ncan  obtain  an average income of around  $200  to\r\n\r\n$300 per month. For a shopkeeper, the total income\r\n\r\nfor a month is more than $400. Sir, these people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  well  afford to support their  families.  For\r\n\r\nthose  people who are economically independent,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we should consider granting citizenship  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another category of applicants may not\r\n\r\nrequire  our support economically. Some  of  these\r\n\r\napplicants are rather old but they have a good and\r\n\r\nsound  economic foundation. Some of them are  well\r\n\r\nsupported by their own children, and they have  no\r\n\r\nproblem  at all in getting a livelihood.  But  why\r\n\r\nare  they applying for citizenship? 1 have  spoken\r\n\r\nto  some  of  them  in the past  as  I  wanted  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  them  better and  to  find  out  their\r\n\r\nreason for applying for citizenship. According  to\r\n\r\nthem, they are applying for citizenship because of\r\n\r\nthe  question of honour. They say that  they  have\r\n\r\nbeen  living in Singapore for many years,  several\r\n\r\ndecades,  in  fact.  They  have  been  law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizens  and in the past they did not  apply  for\r\n\r\ncitizenship earlier because they did not pay  much\r\n\r\nattention to the question of citizenship.  Another\r\n\r\nreason  is that they now understand that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  better  than many other countries.  They  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they are in love with our country. They  say\r\n\r\nthat  living in Singapore allows them  to  have  a\r\n\r\npeaceful  life  and, therefore, they  are  eagerly\r\n\r\nawaiting   their   citizenship.   Of   course,   I\r\n\r\nsympathise with them for the various reasons  they\r\n\r\nhave given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another category of applicants wants to go\r\n\r\noverseas   and  with  citizenship,  it   is   more\r\n\r\nconvenient to apply for a passport. Of course,  we\r\n\r\nhave  issued  Certificates  of  Identity  to  non-citizens  but  they  feel  that  this  is   rather\r\n\r\ninconvenient. I also hope the Minister  will  give\r\n\r\nsympathetic  consideration  to  this  category  of\r\n\r\napplicants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, citizenship\r\n\r\nis not a right but only a privilege. I fully agree\r\n\r\nwith  the statement. But can the Minister say  why\r\n\r\nthere  are so many stateless persons in Singapore?\r\n\r\nThey  are  \"floating\" characters, and are  neither\r\n\r\ncitizens of any country nor are they likely to  be\r\n\r\ngranted  Singapore citizenship. Because  of  their\r\n\r\nstatus,  they  cannot apply for flats  and  cannot\r\n\r\neven go across the Causeway to visit relatives  or\r\n\r\nfriends. Surely they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeserve  a more humane approach by the Government.\r\n\r\nWhy  not  issue them with Certificates of Identity\r\n\r\nso  that at least they can go across the Causeway?\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  there  are  many  people  who   have\r\n\r\napplied for citizenship and although they are kept\r\n\r\nwaiting, they are not told what their chances  are\r\n\r\nof  obtaining citizenship. To assist them  can  we\r\n\r\nnot  give them a specific date when they  will  be\r\n\r\ninformed whether their application is approved  or\r\n\r\nrejected?  They will at least be saved the  misery\r\n\r\nof  the long wait and instead can make alternative\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to thank the Member for Sembawang  for\r\n\r\nquoting   a  statement  I  made  when  I   was   a\r\n\r\nBackbencher  in this House. I have  not  forgotten\r\n\r\nthat statement. Indeed, I thank him for mentioning\r\n\r\nit because I can now say publicly that what I said\r\n\r\nthen   was,  in  fact,  a  less  than  responsible\r\n\r\ncriticism of the Minister of Labour, who was  then\r\n\r\nin  charge  of  the  very difficult  portfolio  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  I was then moved more  by  my  heart\r\n\r\nthan  by careful consideration of the problems  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship in this country. Sir, I am  very  much\r\n\r\nsobered  by the responsibility of office and  know\r\n\r\nthat  what  I  do in the Citizenship  Office  will\r\n\r\naffect the future generations of Singapore. I have\r\n\r\nconsidered the pros and cons of current policy and\r\n\r\nhave  come  to the conclusion that the  policy  on\r\n\r\ncitizenship built up over a period of years is  in\r\n\r\nthe best interest of Singapore - for your children\r\n\r\nand  my  children, and their children's  children.\r\n\r\nHowever, having said this, I would say that by and\r\n\r\nlarge  we  have been very generous and liberal  in\r\n\r\nour  citizenship policy. I have made a calculation\r\n\r\nof  our citizenship figures, and I can say that 28\r\n\r\nper  cent of our citizens are, in fact, registered\r\n\r\ncitizens,  a figure which is high by any standards\r\n\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put the whole problem in its proper\r\n\r\nperspective, let me give a comparison. I will take\r\n\r\nthe  year 1968 as the basis for comparison because\r\n\r\nthis is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  year for which I could collect the necessary\r\n\r\nstatistical  data.  In  Australia,  in  1968,  one\r\n\r\nperson was granted citizenship for every 70 square\r\n\r\nmiles  of  land. In Canada in the same  year,  the\r\n\r\nfigure  was  one  for every 64  square  miles.  In\r\n\r\nMalaysia, it was one for every three square miles.\r\n\r\nIn  New  Zealand, it was one for every four square\r\n\r\nmiles. But in Singapore, we granted citizenship to\r\n\r\n16  persons  for every square mile. I need  hardly\r\n\r\nremind Members that we have only 224 square  miles\r\n\r\nof  land at high tide, with one or two more square\r\n\r\nmiles at low tide. In contrast, Australia has more\r\n\r\nthan 2.9 million square miles of land, Canada  3.9\r\n\r\nmillion  square  miles,  Malaysia  130,000  square\r\n\r\nmiles,  New Zealand about 104,000 square miles.  I\r\n\r\nam  not unmindful of the hardships imposed on  the\r\n\r\npeople,  but I am equally aware of the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of this Government is  towards\r\n\r\nthe  people who are born in Singapore and who have\r\n\r\nno other possibilities of acquiring citizenship in\r\n\r\nother  countries. I think all of us here  in  this\r\n\r\nParliament are kind-hearted and gentle  people.  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  come  across any other  country  except\r\n\r\nSingapore  which shows so much concern for  making\r\n\r\nthings   easier   for   the  people   to   acquire\r\n\r\ncitizenship of her country. In fact, records  over\r\n\r\nthe   past   few  years  have  shown  that   every\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  making it more and more  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  the  people  to acquire citizenship  of  that\r\n\r\ncountry.  Perhaps  this quality  distinguishes  us\r\n\r\nfrom  other people. Despite comments that  we  are\r\n\r\nbecoming  ugly Singaporeans, I suspect  that  deep\r\n\r\ninside  us we have very soft hearts. But there  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  limit beyond which we cannot go,  without\r\n\r\njeopardising  our collective welfare.  It  is  for\r\n\r\nthis  reason that although we are very sympathetic\r\n\r\nin  the granting of citizenship, we are also  very\r\n\r\ncareful in our consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked why do we not fix\r\n\r\na  time  limit and tell the applicants what  their\r\n\r\nchances  are. The reason why we do not  do  so  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we hope that, as time goes on, they  will\r\n\r\nbe  given citizenship. If they do not get  it  the\r\n\r\nfirst  time, there is always a second chance,  and\r\n\r\nthen a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthird.  We do not want to discourage them.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  suggested  that  we are  in  relatively  good\r\n\r\ntimes, and therefore why should we not be generous.\r\n\r\nTrue,   our  economy  has  picked  up  far   beyond\r\n\r\nexpectations in the last two or three years. But  I\r\n\r\nwould like to remind Members of the House that this\r\n\r\nis  the  first time, within the memory of a  living\r\n\r\ngeneration after the Second World War, that we have\r\n\r\nanything like the situation of full employment.  We\r\n\r\nhope  this situation will exist for a long time  to\r\n\r\ncome,   in   which  case  the  whole  question   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship can be reconsidered. Until  we  can  be\r\n\r\nassured  that the good times will last, the present\r\n\r\npolicy will continue. I should hate to think  that,\r\n\r\nbecause of what this Government does and what  this\r\n\r\nHouse wants, in the years to come our children  and\r\n\r\ntheir  children's children would have to go  around\r\n\r\nthe world begging for citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I thank the Minister concerned for expressing\r\n\r\nhis wish that he is going to consider the cases for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  more sympathetically.

With that clarification, I  will\r\n\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present practice is for births which\r\n\r\noccur  in Government hospitals to be registered  at\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals.  Of the total of 45,934  births  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in 1970, 36,129 or about 79 per cent were\r\n\r\nborn  in  hospitals. This system has proved  to  be\r\n\r\nvery  convenient for parents, and it  also  ensures\r\n\r\ncompleteness  of registration. Births occurring  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas  are  now registered  at  the  14\r\n\r\nMaternal and Child Health Clinics, which have  been\r\n\r\ngazetted as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregistration  centres. This not  only  facilitates\r\n\r\nregistration, but enables the Maternal  and  Child\r\n\r\nHealth  Clinic  to undertake post-natal  care  and\r\n\r\nsupervision of the mother and child. Of the  total\r\n\r\nbirths in 1970, only 6,439, or about 14 per  cent,\r\n\r\nwere  registered at Empress Place. It  is  evident\r\n\r\nfrom  the  figures just cited that it is far  more\r\n\r\nconvenient to allow registration at the  different\r\n\r\ncentres than to centralise it at Empress Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  thank  the Minister for his reply. But  what  I\r\n\r\nmean  is not centralisation at Empress Place. What\r\n\r\n1   requested   was   for  Government   to   grant\r\n\r\nregistration facilities at Empress place to  those\r\n\r\nparents  whose  babies  were  born  at  the   K.K.\r\n\r\nHospital. I know the Government has done a lot  in\r\n\r\nimproving  the registration of births. This  is  a\r\n\r\nclear  example of providing better service to  the\r\n\r\npeople by the Government. But I feel it would  be\r\n\r\nbetter if registration service can be provided  at\r\n\r\nEmpress  Place to those who want to  register  the\r\n\r\nbirth  of  their babies who are born in  the  K.K.\r\n\r\nHospital.  The  reason is that  it  is  usual  for\r\n\r\nmothers  to be discharged after a stay of  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  days  in  the K.K. Hospital. The  law  allows\r\n\r\nregistration  of births within 42  days  from  the\r\n\r\ndate  of birth. The husband will have to take  all\r\n\r\nthe trouble to go back to the hospital to register\r\n\r\nthe birth if he happens to be working in the City.\r\n\r\nIt  is  inconvenient  for him.  So.  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nregistration of births at the Empress Place office\r\n\r\nfor the category of persons just mentioned can  be\r\n\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> I understand the point made\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Tiong Bahru.

A few months  ago  the\r\n\r\naction   of  Singapore  Immigration  officials   of\r\n\r\ncutting  the  hair  of long-haired  foreigners  who\r\n\r\nwanted   to   enter  Singapore  at  the   Woodlands\r\n\r\ncheckpoint  was  unsuitable  and  improper.

The  Immigration Department  does  not\r\n\r\nentertain letters from members of the public.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  very conceited attitude on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  officials.

Therefore,   this\r\n\r\ndepartment should entertain letters from members of\r\n\r\nthe  public, whether or not the matters raised  are\r\n\r\nrelevant.

The\r\n\r\ncongestion  in  the public waiting  lounge  in  the\r\n\r\nImmigration office is most unbearable and  chaotic.\r\n\r\nThe  situation now is quite similar to  that  of  a\r\n\r\nfish  market.

They  are,\r\n\r\napart from being partly irrelevant to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  large  national  service  army  such  as  ours,\r\n\r\ninadequate and inappropriate in the context  of  a\r\n\r\nunified force consisting of army, maritime and air\r\n\r\ncommands    which   severally   and   collectively\r\n\r\nconstitute   the  Singapore  Armed   Forces.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, to a professional soldier in a  standing\r\n\r\narmy  to be discharged with ignominy from the army\r\n\r\nwould  be  a  grave form of punishment.  But  this\r\n\r\nwould  not  deter  some  of the  less  responsible\r\n\r\nnational servicemen who would, on the contrary, be\r\n\r\nquite   happy  to  be  discharged  regardless   of\r\n\r\nignominy. For to them ignominy would be the way of\r\n\r\nescape  from  their  military obligations  to  the\r\n\r\nnation. A major difficulty experienced has been in\r\n\r\nregard   to   the   punishment  of   Senior   Non-Commissioned  Officers  and  Officers  who,  under\r\n\r\npresent conditions, can only be tried summarily by\r\n\r\nan  Officer of the rank of Brigadier. There is  no\r\n\r\nsuch  officer in the Singapore Armed Forces today,\r\n\r\nso  that Senor NCOs and Officers either had to  be\r\n\r\ncourt-martialled  or  else let  off  scot-free.  I\r\n\r\nshall  elaborate this further when I  discuss  the\r\n\r\nsalient features of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, the Bill envisages a concept\r\n\r\nappropriate  in  the context of  a  unified  force\r\n\r\ncomprising  the  army, maritime and  air  commands\r\n\r\nwhich are brought under the centralised control of\r\n\r\nan  Armed  Forces Council, which  is  the  overall\r\n\r\nauthority under clauses 7 and 197 of the Bill, for\r\n\r\nall  matters  connected  with  the  Armed  Forces,\r\n\r\nexcept  for the authority vested in the  President\r\n\r\nfor  the  formal  establishment of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed Forces, vide clause 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major portion of the Bill deals with all the\r\n\r\nvarious   matters  covering  and  connected   with\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  measures including the mechanics  of\r\n\r\nthe  administration thereof. Additional or revised\r\n\r\nmilitary offences are introduced and some  of  the\r\n\r\npresent military offences are extended, the  prime\r\n\r\npurpose  being  to  consolidate,  streamline   and\r\n\r\ntelescope  within one single enactment  the  usual\r\n\r\nmilitary  offences  that are ordinarily  found  in\r\n\r\nmilitary law enactments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major change brought about by the Bill is in\r\n\r\nrespect of summary trials. There is now introduced\r\n\r\na  system  of  trial by disciplinary  officers  to\r\n\r\nreplace the system of trial by Company Commanders,\r\n\r\ncommanding   officers  and  appropriate   superior\r\n\r\nauthority  under  the Singapore  Army  Act,  1965,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  only person who can be the appropriate\r\n\r\nsuperior authority is a Brigadier. Under  the  new\r\n\r\nsystem introduced in the Bill, there will be three\r\n\r\ntypes  of  disciplinary officers,  namely,  junior\r\n\r\ndisciplinary    officers,   senior    disciplinary\r\n\r\nofficers, and superior commanders, and it  further\r\n\r\nallows the appointment of any person commanding  a\r\n\r\ncommand,  a  formation or any other  person  as  a\r\n\r\nsuperior commander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Singapore Army Act. Company Commanders\r\n\r\ncan  only  deal with offences committed  by  Other\r\n\r\nRanks  of  the rank of corporal and below,  whilst\r\n\r\nCommanding Officers are allowed to deal only  with\r\n\r\ntemporary  warrant officers and those  below  that\r\n\r\nrank.  Officers with the rank of Second Lieutenant\r\n\r\nto  Captain  and substantive warrant officers  are\r\n\r\ndealt  with by the appropriate superior authority,\r\n\r\nwhilst  officers above the rank of Captain  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  dealt  with  summarily but only  by  a  court-martial.  This  Bill, on the  other  hand,  allows\r\n\r\njunior and senior disciplinary officers, that  is,\r\n\r\nCompany and Battalion Commanders respectively,  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  Other Ranks of the rank  of  temporary\r\n\r\nwarrant   officers   and   below;   and   superior\r\n\r\ncommanders, that is, Brigade Commanders,  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith substantive warrant officers and above up  to\r\n\r\nthe  rank  of  Major.  Persons  of  the  rank   of\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel  and  above   who   could   not\r\n\r\npreviously be dealt with summarily can now  be  so\r\n\r\ndealt with by the Armed Forces Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the powers of punishment of disciplinary\r\n\r\nofficers  have been increased, the main aim  being\r\n\r\nto  dispose  of more cases expeditiously  at  unit\r\n\r\nlevel.  Under  the  Bill,  a  junior  disciplinary\r\n\r\nofficer can award up to 10 days' detention to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprivates and recruits, a form of punishment  which\r\n\r\nhe  could not award under the Singapore Army  Act,\r\n\r\nunder  which  the most severe punishment  which  a\r\n\r\nCompany Commander could award to NCOs of the  rank\r\n\r\nof  Corporal  and  below was a reprimand,  and  to\r\n\r\nsoldiers  the  minor punishment or restriction  of\r\n\r\nprivileges up to a maximum of seven days. The most\r\n\r\nsevere punishment that a Commanding Officer  could\r\n\r\naward  previously was 28 days' detention and  that\r\n\r\ntoo  only  to privates and recruits, and the  most\r\n\r\nsevere  punishment  that  he  could  award  to   a\r\n\r\nsubstantive  NCO was nothing more  than  a  severe\r\n\r\nreprimand.  This  Bill does away  with  all  these\r\n\r\nrestrictions   and   allows  senior   disciplinary\r\n\r\nofficers  to award detentions of 40 days  even  to\r\n\r\nNCOs.  The Bill also allows the superior commander\r\n\r\nto  award detention to warrant officers, which  he\r\n\r\ncould  not  do under the Singapore Army  Act,  the\r\n\r\nmost  severe punishment under which being  just  a\r\n\r\nforfeiture of seniority of rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very good reasons for increasing the\r\n\r\npower of punishment of disciplinary officers. From\r\n\r\nwhat I have said above, hon. Members will see that\r\n\r\nextremely  light  punishments were  meted  out  to\r\n\r\nNCOs, both regulars and national servicemen.  This\r\n\r\ntended  to  give  the impression  that  they  were\r\n\r\nimmune  from serious punishments unless  the  case\r\n\r\nwent up for a court-martial. There were some cases\r\n\r\nof  indiscipline during the last few weeks  before\r\n\r\nthe national servicemen NCOs were due for release.\r\n\r\nThese   acts  of  indiscipline  certainly  warrant\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  action  of a  higher  level  than  a\r\n\r\nreprimand  at  the  unit level. Under  this  Bill,\r\n\r\nsenior disciplinary officers will be able to award\r\n\r\ndetention  to  NCOs, and superior  commanders  can\r\n\r\naward  detention  to  warrant  officers,  measures\r\n\r\nwhich will certainly dispel any impression amongst\r\n\r\nthe  less  responsible  that  they  can  get  away\r\n\r\nlightly    for   their   misdemeanours.   Further,\r\n\r\npunishment for an offence which did not warrant  a\r\n\r\ncourt-martial  was  inadequate.  For  instance,  a\r\n\r\nsoldier who absents himself without leave  for  35\r\n\r\ndays could, as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaw now stands, only be detained for a maximum  of\r\n\r\n28  days by his Commanding Officer. Clearly,  this\r\n\r\nmust  be  rectified and the Bill,  therefore,  now\r\n\r\nallows Commanding Officers to give up to 40  days'\r\n\r\ndetention.  A further reason is that the  increase\r\n\r\nin  punishment will allow cases to be  dealt  with\r\n\r\nmore  expeditiously.  An example  will  illustrate\r\n\r\nthis. Let us take a national serviceman NCO who is\r\n\r\ndue  to be released from national service in three\r\n\r\ndays'  time. He commits an offence which  deserves\r\n\r\nsomething more than the punishment of a reprimand.\r\n\r\nUnder the present law, detention of NCOs can  only\r\n\r\nbe  awarded  by a court-martial. The NCO  in  this\r\n\r\ncase  will have to be held back from release until\r\n\r\na  court-martial  is held and he  has  served  his\r\n\r\npunishment.   Under  the  Bill,   however,   since\r\n\r\ndetention  can be given to NCOs by the  Commanding\r\n\r\nOfficers, such cases can be quickly dealt with  by\r\n\r\nthe   Commanding  Officer  himself.  Further,  the\r\n\r\nincrease in punishment will also allow more  cases\r\n\r\nto  be  disposed of at unit level.  It  must  not,\r\n\r\nhowever,  be  assumed  that the  offender  has  no\r\n\r\nsafeguard.  If  in any case he feels  that  he  is\r\n\r\nbeing wrongly punished and the punishment that the\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  officer  is  going   to   award   is\r\n\r\nsomething more than a reprimand, he can  elect  to\r\n\r\nbe tried by a subordinate military court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that errors by disciplinary officers in\r\n\r\ndealing  with  cases are corrected  and  that  any\r\n\r\nabuse  of  powers  is checked,  the  Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nCouncil  has  been given the power  of  review  to\r\n\r\nenable  it  to quash the findings and sentences  0\r\n\r\ndisciplinary   officers  and  to  substitute   new\r\n\r\nfindings  and  sentences. For the  information  of\r\n\r\nhon.  Members, I must point out that there  is  no\r\n\r\nsuch  system  of  review under the Singapore  Army\r\n\r\nAct.  However,  the power of review under  section\r\n\r\n115  of the British Army Act has been made use of.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to note, however, that the Armed\r\n\r\nForces Council in reviewing a case can only  award\r\n\r\na lesser form of punishment. It cannot enhance the\r\n\r\npunishment already awarded. An enhanced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npunishment  can  only  be  awarded  by   a\r\n\r\nMilitary Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now discuss the system of military\r\n\r\ncourts,  including the Military Court  of  Appeal,\r\n\r\nintroduced by this Bill. Under the present  set-up\r\n\r\nthere  are three types of courts-martial,  namely,\r\n\r\ngeneral  courts-martial,  district  courts-martial\r\n\r\nand  field-general  courts-martial.  Officers  can\r\n\r\nonly be tried by general courts-martial and field-general  courts-martial while other personnel  can\r\n\r\nbe  tried  by  all  three types of courts-martial.\r\n\r\nFurther, whilst general courts-martial and  field-general  courts-martial can  award  death  or  any\r\n\r\nlesser punishment, the most severe punishment that\r\n\r\ndistrict courts-martial can award, however, is two\r\n\r\nyears'  imprisonment. There is,  as  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwill appreciate, no reason to have three types  of\r\n\r\ncourts-martial when two can serve the purpose just\r\n\r\nas  well.  We  can  do away with district  courts-martial and have, instead, one court, that is, the\r\n\r\ngeneral  courts-martial to deal with all personnel\r\n\r\nirrespective   of  rank.  This  Bill,   therefore,\r\n\r\nsimplifies   the   military  court   system.   The\r\n\r\nsubordinate military courts shall consist  of  two\r\n\r\ntypes  of courts-martial, namely, general  courts-martial and the field-general courts-martial, both\r\n\r\nof which can deal with all servicemen irrespective\r\n\r\nof  rank.  However, a field-general courts-martial\r\n\r\nwill only be convened when a unit of the Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces to which the offender belongs is  on\r\n\r\nactive service. Each of these courts shall consist\r\n\r\nof not less than three officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill establishes for the first time a\r\n\r\nMilitary Court of Appeal. No such court exists now\r\n\r\nand  the only remedy that the aggrieved party  has\r\n\r\nin  such  circumstances  is  to  petition  to  the\r\n\r\nconfirming  authority  against  the  findings  and\r\n\r\nsentence. The Military Court of Appeal established\r\n\r\nby   this   Bill   is,  therefore,  an   important\r\n\r\ninnovation;  it  can  hear and  determine  appeals\r\n\r\nagainst decisions made by the subordinate military\r\n\r\ncourts.  There  is, however, no  appeal  from  the\r\n\r\nMilitary   Court  of  Appeal  whose   powers   are\r\n\r\nanalogous  to  those  of  the  Court  of  Criminal\r\n\r\nAppeal. The President of the Court shall either\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe a Judge of the High Court or a person qualified\r\n\r\nto  be such. There are four other members, two  of\r\n\r\nwhom  are  to be legally qualified persons  of  at\r\n\r\nleast  five years' standing. The other two members\r\n\r\nwill be officers of the Singapore Armed Forces  of\r\n\r\nor above the rank of Captain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment which subordinate military courts\r\n\r\ncan  impose  range from death to minor punishment.\r\n\r\nFor  non-military offences, a subordinate military\r\n\r\ncourt  can impose the same punishment as  a  civil\r\n\r\ncourt.   A   new  punishment,  however,   deserves\r\n\r\nmention.  Subordinate  military  courts  can,  for\r\n\r\ncertain offences, require a reservist to serve for\r\n\r\na  further  period  of service  not  exceeding  12\r\n\r\nmonths.  Provision is also made for the suspension\r\n\r\nof  sentences and for the grant of a pardon by the\r\n\r\nPresident for an offender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another salient feature of the Bill is the\r\n\r\nenlargement   of   the  powers   of   search   and\r\n\r\ninvestigation. Hitherto, under the Singapore  Army\r\n\r\nAct,  investigations have been  done  by  officers\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Commanding Officer and  military\r\n\r\npolicemen had powers to investigate only with  the\r\n\r\npermission  of the Commanding Officer. This  Bill,\r\n\r\nhowever,  removes the restrictions placed  on  the\r\n\r\npowers of investigation and search. There will  be\r\n\r\ntwo    categories   of   investigating   officers:\r\n\r\ninvestigating  officers  authorised  by  a  senior\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  officer or a superior  commander  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate   specific   offences   and   Military\r\n\r\nPolicemen  who may investigate all offences.  This\r\n\r\nis necessary in a rapidly expanding force, many of\r\n\r\nwhose   units   are   commanded   by   young   and\r\n\r\ninexperienced officers. Other important aspects of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  are  the  powers to set  up  Boards  of\r\n\r\nInquiry  where there is a matter relating  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces which would be desirable to\r\n\r\ninvestigate into; the emergency powers in  clauses\r\n\r\n191  and  192 which can be brought into  operation\r\n\r\nonly if the President so declares for securing the\r\n\r\npublic  safety  or  the defence of  the  Republic;\r\n\r\nreduction in rank for inefficiency  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof a member of the Singapore Armed Forces;\r\n\r\nand,   last  but  not  least,  channels  by  which\r\n\r\nservicemen who are wronged in any matter may lodge\r\n\r\ncomplaints to seek a redress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Enlistment Act effected\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Singapore Armed  Forces  Bill  would\r\n\r\nenable an employer to recover from Government  any\r\n\r\namount  that  he  has  paid as  makeup  pay  to  a\r\n\r\nreservist  or  a  person  who  is  mobilised,   by\r\n\r\ndeductions from pay-roll tax, if the reservist  is\r\n\r\nself-employed,  he  can  claim  make-up  pay  from\r\n\r\nmonies to be provided by Parliament. However, if a\r\n\r\nreservist  is  convicted of  a  specified  offence\r\n\r\ninvolving a breach of discipline and the court  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  on the evidence that the reservist  has\r\n\r\nshown  himself to be not responsive to discipline,\r\n\r\nthe court may punish him under clause 114 (14)  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  by  requiring him to  serve  a  further\r\n\r\nperiod  of  service not exceeding 12  months.  The\r\n\r\nreservist, if working under a contract of  employ-merit,  would be entitled to receive  make-up  pay\r\n\r\nfrom  his  employer during the further  period  of\r\n\r\nservice, but the employer cannot deduct this  from\r\n\r\npayroll  tax. An employer would not be obliged  to\r\n\r\nreinstate   such  a  reservist  in  his   civilian\r\n\r\nemployment.  Indeed  an employer  can,  if  he  so\r\n\r\nwishes, dismiss such reservist from his employment\r\n\r\nat  any  time  prior  to the  completion  of  such\r\n\r\nadditional reserve service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members may look askance at these measures\r\n\r\nnow introduced by the Bill as they are undoubtedly\r\n\r\na  departure  from  what may be considered  to  be\r\n\r\naccepted norms. But good and potent reasons  exist\r\n\r\nto  introduce these measures if our Army is not to\r\n\r\ndegenerate into a rabble of indiscipline soldiers.\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of incidents which do not\r\n\r\ncredit  the Singapore Armed Forces and  which,  if\r\n\r\nnot  curbed  or deterred, can bring the  Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces into disrepute. One of a  number  of\r\n\r\nincidents that have taken place will convince hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the absolute necessity to  adopt  the\r\n\r\nstrong measures proposed in the Bill. A number  of\r\n\r\nreservist  service  officers  were  called  up  to\r\n\r\nattend a conversion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse  sometime in November last year.  From  the\r\n\r\nvery  start,  these officers continuously  carried\r\n\r\nout their training in an unwilling manner. Towards\r\n\r\nthe  end  of the exercise, however, the reservists\r\n\r\ntook  it  upon  themselves to walk  off  from  the\r\n\r\nexercise,   without   the   permission   of    the\r\n\r\ninstructors.  They  also  hailed  two  lorries  to\r\n\r\ntransport them back to the Singapore Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nTraining   Institute  leaving  their   tools   and\r\n\r\nequipment behind in the training area. Because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  these officers had their training  extended\r\n\r\nfor  one  week, and this had a salutary effect  as\r\n\r\nthey showed that they were capable of carrying out\r\n\r\ntheir  tasks as required of them. This  particular\r\n\r\nincident  is  one which would call  for  the  most\r\n\r\nsevere   form  of  punishment  possible.  Clearly,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  more stringent laws are  necessary  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  such  situations.  However  exalted  a\r\n\r\nsoldier  may consider his civilian occupation  and\r\n\r\nstanding, he is not outside the scope of  military\r\n\r\ndiscipline  once  he  is in  uniform.  The  strong\r\n\r\nmeasures   introduced  in  the  Bill   will   deal\r\n\r\nappropriately with those predisposed to insolence,\r\n\r\nindifference and indiscipline which must  not  and\r\n\r\ncannot  be  tolerated. Discipline  and  order  are\r\n\r\nsacrosanct  in  any army, and an  army  devoid  of\r\n\r\nthese  qualities  will not be able  to  serve  the\r\n\r\nnation well and truly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I must point out that through\r\n\r\nthis Bill an amendment is also made to the Finance\r\n\r\nAct to provide for a new definition of \"payroll\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will see from what I have said so\r\n\r\nfar that in concept and design the Bill is nothing\r\n\r\nmore   than  an  attempt  to  make  good   glaring\r\n\r\ndeficiencies in the existing law and to  encompass\r\n\r\nwithin  the framework of one enactment the subject\r\n\r\nof military discipline in all its manifestations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

We\r\n\r\nshould pay tribute to the Ministry of Defence  for\r\n\r\nhaving completed the work of reorganisation of the\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces  and the drafting of its  basic  law\r\n\r\nwithin   the   shortest  time  of  the  Ministry's\r\n\r\nexistence,  particularly  in  the  context  of   a\r\n\r\nsociety  which  did  not have sound  or  organised\r\n\r\nmartial traditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned with Part IV of the Bill.\r\n\r\nWhile Part IV of the Bill lays clown an attractive\r\n\r\nprocedure  for  the summary trial of  offences  by\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  officers,  clause  65  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\ntypifies the basic human problem that we  face  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  whether in civilian or  military  life\r\n\r\nand  the  problem of trained human beings fighting\r\n\r\nshy  of  making unpleasant decisions. It would  be\r\n\r\ninteresting to see if the Armed Forces  would  set\r\n\r\nnew  standards which would not fail to  be  humane\r\n\r\nfor their civilian counterparts to emulate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the performance of the judicial function is\r\n\r\nnot  an easy one. It calls for qualities of  total\r\n\r\nhuman breeding and responsibility which few humans\r\n\r\nare  blessed with at the best of times. We are now\r\n\r\ncalling for these very qualities from the  men  of\r\n\r\nthe  Armed  Forces,  and we  must  hope  that  the\r\n\r\ntraditions  that they do establish would  help  to\r\n\r\nmould  the  Armed  Forces into a  civilised  force\r\n\r\nworthy of the fair name of Singapore. We have  the\r\n\r\nbeginnings of military jurisprudence,  and  it  is\r\n\r\nessential that we build up expertise in this field\r\n\r\nfrom  among the ranks of the officers of the Armed\r\n\r\nForces within the shortest possible time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to give my support to this Bill. I am glad to\r\n\r\nnote  that one of the objects of this Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  unified force called  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed Forces consisting of military, maritime  and\r\n\r\nair   commands.   This  Bill  is   definitely   an\r\n\r\nimprovement of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore Army Act, 1965, and the People's Defence\r\n\r\nForce  Act,  which my colleague,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang,  has just pointed out  that  these\r\n\r\nActs  were temporary measures designed to meet  an\r\n\r\nemergency situation. I Xho1e-heartedly agree  with\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Member has just mentioned. I also  note\r\n\r\nthat this Bill will provide for the establishment,\r\n\r\nadministration, maintenance and discipline of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed Forces. In other words,  all  the\r\n\r\nthree sectors of the Singapore Armed Forces,  i.e.\r\n\r\nthe  military, the maritime and air commands, will\r\n\r\nnow come directly under this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I do not wish to go into the Bill in\r\n\r\ndetail,  I  would like to touch  on  some  of  the\r\n\r\npoints  raised by the Minister of State of Defence\r\n\r\npertaining to discipline. I am quite surprised  to\r\n\r\nnote  that  the  various  breaches  of  discipline\r\n\r\ncommitted by the rank and file could only be dealt\r\n\r\nwith  by certain categories of officers at certain\r\n\r\nlevels under the two previous Acts. But now,  with\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of the Singapore  Armed  Forces\r\n\r\nCouncil,  it  is noted that radical  changes  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made and introduced in this Bill which  will\r\n\r\nempower    officers   like   company   commanders,\r\n\r\nbattalion commanders, brigade commanders  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  acts of indiscipline committed by  the  rank\r\n\r\nand  file of the Singapore Armed Forces. I  cannot\r\n\r\ndisagree  with  the Minister of State  of  Defence\r\n\r\nwhen  he  enumerated the various types of offences\r\n\r\nfor  which nothing much could be done in the  case\r\n\r\nof  senior officers, and that for certain offences\r\n\r\nthere  is  the need for a Brigadier  to  mete  out\r\n\r\npunishment.  But since the Singapore Armed  Forces\r\n\r\ndo  not  have the rank of Brigadier at the  moment\r\n\r\nexcept  Colonels and below, I think this Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces  Bill  would streamline  the  entire\r\n\r\nForce  and will empower the various commanders  at\r\n\r\nvarious  unit  levels to look into  and  mete  out\r\n\r\npunishment  that is proper to the  severity  of  a\r\n\r\nbreach of discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Minister of State mentioned an\r\n\r\ninstance   when   some  of  our  N.C.O. national\r\n\r\nservicemen simply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwalked   out   during  an  exercise  without   any\r\n\r\npermission. Sir, this is one of the many  examples\r\n\r\nwhich  the Minister of State has brought to  light\r\n\r\nin  this House. I am even more surprised to  learn\r\n\r\nwhy  these  culprits  who have  breached  military\r\n\r\ndiscipline could not be more severely dealt  with.\r\n\r\nI hope that with the establishment of this Council\r\n\r\nmuch improvement can be seen in the running of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I am pleased\r\n\r\nto  see  that clause 196 provides for the mode  of\r\n\r\ncomplaint by servicemen. It seems to me  that  the\r\n\r\naverage national serviceman is not aware that this\r\n\r\nis one area where he can sound out his grievances.\r\n\r\nMore  often  than not he feels that  he  has  been\r\n\r\nwronged  but does not know how to go about  it  to\r\n\r\ncomplain  to  his superior officers.  This  clause\r\n\r\nsets down the procedure how to go about it. I hope\r\n\r\nthat,  in  the  implementation of this  Bill,  the\r\n\r\nparticular  provision under clause 196 is  brought\r\n\r\nto the attention of all national service recruits,\r\n\r\nand  that  preferably each recruit is  given  some\r\n\r\nguidance   and  explanation  in  the   particular\r\n\r\nlanguage in which he is conversant with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Sir, with regard to the\r\n\r\nobservations  made by the Member for  Jalan  Kayu,\r\n\r\nprocedures have, in fact, been laid down  for  any\r\n\r\nnational   serviceman  to  raise  any   grievances\r\n\r\nthrough   the   proper  channels.   All   national\r\n\r\nservicemen   have  been  acquainted   with   these\r\n\r\nprocedures,  and I believe that many of  them  are\r\n\r\nfully aware of them.

In i 967 a new campus  for\r\n\r\nthe College was built from public donations on the\r\n\r\nKongsi's land in Clementi Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968, with massive financial support from the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  College was reorganised  into  a\r\n\r\ntechnical  college  offering  diploma  courses  in\r\n\r\nengineering  and  commerce.

This\r\n\r\ncontribution   is  made  in  accordance   with   a\r\n\r\nresolution  passed by the Committee of  Management\r\n\r\nof  the Kongsi at a meeting held on 5th May, 1967.\r\n\r\nTo  cover  the remaining major part of its  annual\r\n\r\nincreasing  budget,  the  College  has  also  been\r\n\r\nreceiving  grants from the Government  since  the\r\n\r\nAct came into force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the reorganisation in 1968, the Kongsi has\r\n\r\ncontributed  $400,000 to the College,  as  against\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance from the Government totalling\r\n\r\nover  $2.5  million. With the proposed development\r\n\r\nplan,   the  administrative  expenditure  of   the\r\n\r\nCollege  is  expected to rise  very  substantially\r\n\r\nfrom its present level of $2 million per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee of Management of Ngee Ann Kongsi at\r\n\r\na  recent meeting adopted another resolution  that\r\n\r\nthe  quantum of its contribution to the  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nTechnical College be increased from 50 per cent to\r\n\r\n75  per  cent  of  its income.  The  Committee  of\r\n\r\nManagement  also  decided that these  resolutions,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  to donate 75 per cent of its income  to\r\n\r\nthe  College, should be embodied in its Ordinance.\r\n\r\nIn  this  respect, Sir, the term \"income\"  assumes\r\n\r\nthe  normal commercial interpretation which is the\r\n\r\ntotal  receipts less the normal direct operational\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move follows from the fact that the Kongsi\r\n\r\nproposes  to  develop its land along Orchard  Road\r\n\r\nwhich,  when materialised, holds promise  of  very\r\n\r\nsubstantial future income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property along Orchard Road was originally a\r\n\r\nburial ground, but was allowed to be converted for\r\n\r\nresidential  and  commercial uses  by  the  former\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to congratulate the Ngee Ann Kongsi\r\n\r\nfor this decision which is in full accord with the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  the  Prime  Minister's  remarks   made\r\n\r\nrecently over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  burial grounds in general,  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  it  is not proper that  private  and\r\n\r\nsectional groups should benefit from the gains  in\r\n\r\nvalue  or productivity of land resulting from  the\r\n\r\npublic  developments taking place around  it,  but\r\n\r\nrather  that  the  society,  as  a  whole,  should\r\n\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to compliment tile Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn  Kongsi for this bold and progressive approach\r\n\r\nto  educational support by the direct  application\r\n\r\nof  property and business income.

There are,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nat  the present moment, certain exemptions to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral   requirement.  These  are  contained   in\r\n\r\nsubsection   (2)  of  section  30;  for   example,\r\n\r\nsolicitors  employed by certain Statutory  Boards,\r\n\r\nlike the Housing and Development Board, the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board, the Economic Development  Board,\r\n\r\nthe  Jurong  Town  Corporation  and  the  Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Authority, may now practise in  certain\r\n\r\nmatters  as  may  be specified  in  a  certificate\r\n\r\nissued   by   the   Attorney-General.   Upon   the\r\n\r\ncertification   of   the   Attorney-General,   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of the Supreme Court will issue to  such\r\n\r\na  solicitor a certificate in lieu of a practising\r\n\r\ncertificate. The solicitor concerned would then be\r\n\r\nable  to practise in such branches of the law  and\r\n\r\nonly in his capacity as an employee of the various\r\n\r\nStatutory   Boards  in  which  he   is   employed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  this  exemption  clause  has  been\r\n\r\nfound  to be defective in the sense that it  would\r\n\r\nnot  apply  to a member of the Legal Service,  who\r\n\r\nmay  not  even  defend  any member  of  the  Legal\r\n\r\nService, or Civil Service, who is or may  be  sued\r\n\r\nin  his  private  capacity for acts  done  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of his official duties. It is in order  to\r\n\r\nremove this restriction that the present amendment\r\n\r\nhas  been  devised.  Legal officers  who,  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of their duties, meet with difficulties  by\r\n\r\nway of having suits brought against them, will  be\r\n\r\nable  to,  where they so desire, have the services\r\n\r\nof a State Counsel. I must add, however, that this\r\n\r\namendment  will not preclude private practitioners\r\n\r\nfrom  acting on behalf of those officers, nor will\r\n\r\nit  restrict the choice of solicitors by those who\r\n\r\nmay   be   faced   with  legal  action   in   such\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment, that is, in clause 3 of\r\n\r\nthe  Amendment  Bill,  will  have  the  result  of\r\n\r\nconfining  the  eligibility of membership  in  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of the Bar, which is the body responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the maintenance of standards of etiquette and\r\n\r\nof  conduct  of  members of the legal  profession,\r\n\r\nsolely  to those who are of Singapore nationality.\r\n\r\nIt  has been felt that so important a body, as the\r\n\r\nlegal  profession,  should  be  managed,  in  such\r\n\r\nimportant  matters  as  disciplinary  control,  by\r\n\r\nthose of that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofession who are our own citizens so  that  they\r\n\r\nmay  reflect, it is hoped, the needs,  aspirations\r\n\r\nand   standards  of  behaviour  of  not  only  the\r\n\r\nprofession  but also of the society in which  they\r\n\r\nlive  and practise. It is felt that nationals with\r\n\r\ntheir  roots  in the country would be  more  in  a\r\n\r\nposition   to   set  standards  which   would   be\r\n\r\nacceptable to all in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, however, that in so far as the\r\n\r\npresent members of the Council are concerned, they\r\n\r\nare  all Singapore citizens so that in effect  the\r\n\r\nBill will only affect the future membership of the\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last amendment in clause 4 has been asked for\r\n\r\nby  the  Council itself in reducing the number  of\r\n\r\nmembers  necessary to form a quorum from seven  to\r\n\r\nfive. The Council of the Law Society feels that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  quite impracticable to insist on  seven\r\n\r\nout of ten members in the Council to be present in\r\n\r\norder to form a quorum. Recent amendments have had\r\n\r\nthe  effect  of reducing the overall size  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil,  and  it  is  for  this  reason  that   a\r\n\r\nreduction in the number necessary for a quorum has\r\n\r\nbeen requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[Mr E.

The\r\n\r\nBill  in  its  draft  stage was  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  the  Law Society of  Singapore  which\r\n\r\nsubmitted its recommendations thereon. The Council\r\n\r\naccepted   the  principle  of  admitting   written\r\n\r\nstatements  at  preliminary  inquiries,  observing\r\n\r\nthat this would (and I quote) \"undoubtedly lighten\r\n\r\nthe  burden  of Magistrates' Courts  in  committal\r\n\r\nproceedings  without  in any way  prejudicing  the\r\n\r\ninterests  either  of the prosecution  or  of  the\r\n\r\ndefence\".  The Council also suggested a number  of\r\n\r\nmodifications  to  the Bill which  were  carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered  and  which have,  in  the  main,  been\r\n\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Members would have read a detailed account\r\n\r\nof  the  contents  of the Bill in the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement, it would be helpful, I think, if I were\r\n\r\nto  touch  on  the principal aspects  of  the  new\r\n\r\nprocedure  that  this legislation  will  introduce\r\n\r\ninto   our  subordinate  courts.  1  should  first\r\n\r\nexplain  that preliminary inquiries in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nas in England, were originally considered to be an\r\n\r\nextra safeguard for the accused. This procedure is\r\n\r\ninterposed between the arrest of a suspect and his\r\n\r\neventual trial before the High Court and  has,  as\r\n\r\nits  main  object, the examination of the evidence\r\n\r\nof  the  prosecution and its sufficiency in making\r\n\r\nout  a  prima  facie case against the accused  for\r\n\r\ntrial   before  the  High  Court.  Of   necessity,\r\n\r\ntherefore, it was confined solely to such cases as\r\n\r\nwere  cognisable  only  in  the  High  Court.  The\r\n\r\ncurrent  practice in Singapore has, however,  made\r\n\r\nit extremely doubtful as to the usefulness of this\r\n\r\naspect  or  stage  of  criminal  proceedings.  The\r\n\r\nprimary  purpose of these proceedings, namely,  to\r\n\r\nallow lawyers to examine the adequacy of the  case\r\n\r\nalleged  against  an  accused  by  cross-examining\r\n\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution, does not appear  to\r\n\r\nhave  been  utilised to the full.  In  many  cases\r\n\r\nthere  is  not  even  a  submission  made  to  the\r\n\r\nexamining   Magistrate  at  the   close   of   the\r\n\r\nproceedings,  the  case  for  the  defence   being\r\n\r\nreserved  until such time as the trial  begins  in\r\n\r\nthe High Court. Indeed, this practice has resulted\r\n\r\nin committal proceedings or preliminary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninquiries  sometimes working against the  interests\r\n\r\nof  an accused person. Newspapers that report these\r\n\r\nproceedings  often dwell only on the case  for  the\r\n\r\nprosecution, while nothing is recorded of the  case\r\n\r\nfor  the  defence. This could result in an  accused\r\n\r\nbeing prejudiced at his trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the existing procedure with\r\n\r\nregard to preliminary inquiries to be abandoned  in\r\n\r\nfavour of committals to the High Court without  the\r\n\r\nnecessity   of   examining   witnesses   for    the\r\n\r\nprosecution  on oath at a court hearing  before  an\r\n\r\nexamining  Magistrate.  This  will  no  longer   be\r\n\r\nrequired of the examining Magistrate for, under the\r\n\r\nproposed procedure, he may commit an accused person\r\n\r\nto the High Court for trial if he is satisfied that\r\n\r\nall the evidence for the prosecution or the defence\r\n\r\nconsists   of  written  statements  which  disclose\r\n\r\nsufficient  evidence to put the  accused  upon  his\r\n\r\ntrial. While, however, the Bill is an adaptation of\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom Criminal Justice Act, 1967, much\r\n\r\nof  the English procedure being incorporated in the\r\n\r\nBill,  it  is  not exactly on all  fours  with  the\r\n\r\ncurrent English practice in that whereas in England\r\n\r\n\"paper   committals\",  as  they  are   known,   are\r\n\r\noptional, here they are to be compulsory.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  much of the purpose behind the Bill  would\r\n\r\nbe  lost  if the English procedure were adhered  to\r\n\r\nrigidly since it is more than likely that in almost\r\n\r\nall  cases here counsel for the defence will  elect\r\n\r\nto  proceed  under  the  old  system  of  examining\r\n\r\nwitnesses  for the prosecution one by  one,  orally\r\n\r\nupon  oath before the committing Magistrate,  which\r\n\r\nwould   defeat   the  very  object   of   the   new\r\n\r\nlegislation. Another significant difference is that\r\n\r\nunder the English procedure, the Magistrate has the\r\n\r\npower  to  commit  an  accused  for  trial  without\r\n\r\nconsidering  the written statements  of  witnesses,\r\n\r\nwhile  under our proposed procedure the  Magistrate\r\n\r\nis  bound  to consider the contents of the  written\r\n\r\nstatements of witnesses to decide whether there  is\r\n\r\nsufficient evidence to commit an accused for trial.\r\n\r\nThis may be regarded as an important safeguard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticularly where an accused is not represented by\r\n\r\ncounsel at the preliminary inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the new system proposed in the Bill\r\n\r\nhas  the merit of saving the time of the court  and\r\n\r\nof the parties as well as of avoiding inconvenience\r\n\r\nand expense to witnesses. On the other hand, as  in\r\n\r\nEngland, a considerably enhanced workload will have\r\n\r\nto  be  borne  by the Attorney-General's  Chambers,\r\n\r\nsince  as  a  result of the amending Act statements\r\n\r\nwill  need  to  be examined carefully to  ascertain\r\n\r\nwhether   they   sufficiently   disclose   evidence\r\n\r\nadmissible  in  court to prove  the  guilt  of  the\r\n\r\naccused. The clarification of doubtful points which\r\n\r\nmust  be effected before the hearing will also take\r\n\r\nup  time. I take the view, which is shared  by  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General,  that the additional  work  which\r\n\r\nthe  new  legislation will involve for his Chambers\r\n\r\nwould  be well worthwhile since it would be in  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the more efficient administration  of\r\n\r\njustice  and of the hundreds of witnesses who  have\r\n\r\nto  give  evidence in our subordinate  courts  each\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must hasten to assure Members that the new\r\n\r\nprocedure,  as  embodied in the Bill,  accomplishes\r\n\r\nthe same purpose as the existing procedure which is\r\n\r\nsought to be replaced. The principal difference  is\r\n\r\nthat in the existing procedure an oral statement of\r\n\r\na witness is taken down by the court in the form of\r\n\r\na  deposition,  that  is, a statement  on  oath  or\r\n\r\naffirmation, arid witnesses are liable to be cross-examined  on  that statement, while under  the  new\r\n\r\nprocedure a copy of the written statement made by a\r\n\r\nwitness and signed by him and certified by him that\r\n\r\nit  is true to the best of his knowledge and belief\r\n\r\nwill be given to the defence or the prosecution, as\r\n\r\nthe case may be, before it is tendered in evidence.\r\n\r\nAfter  all  the  written statements and  all  other\r\n\r\nevidence  in support of the prosecution  have  been\r\n\r\nreceived in evidence, the examining Magistrate will\r\n\r\nthen  generally  follow the existing  procedure  of\r\n\r\neither committing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe accused for trial, discharging him or\r\n\r\ndealing with the case summarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also contains two provisions modelled on\r\n\r\nthe English Act. The first relates to restrictions\r\n\r\non  the  publication  of  reports  of  preliminary\r\n\r\ninquiries in newspapers, radio and television with\r\n\r\na  view  to  safeguarding  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\naccused.  Certain particulars such  as  the  name,\r\n\r\naddress and occupation of the accused, the offence\r\n\r\nand  decision  of  the court are permitted  to  be\r\n\r\ncontained in reports. The second provision  is  to\r\n\r\nthe effect that the accused shall not, without the\r\n\r\ncourt's permission, adduce evidence in support  of\r\n\r\nan  alibi unless he gives notice of particulars of\r\n\r\nthe  alibi.  This is to ensure that no last-minute\r\n\r\ndefence of alibi is sprung upon the prosecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two fresh technical provisions relating to\r\n\r\nevidence  contained in the Bill  are  set  out  in\r\n\r\nclause  4  and  are explained at the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by\r\n\r\nmaking  two  points. First, the new  procedure  as\r\n\r\ncontained in the Bill achieves the same object  as\r\n\r\nthe  present  parallel provisions of the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code in that the accused will  be  made\r\n\r\naware  of  the  case  that he has  to  meet;  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly, there have been no serious criticisms in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom as to the  operation  of  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Justice Act, 1967, on which our  Bill  is\r\n\r\nlargely  based. Indeed, the general  consensus  is\r\n\r\none of approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONTROLLED PREMISES (SPECIAL PROVISIONS)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in this Bill are\r\n\r\nconcerned   principally  with   the   compensatory\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Controlled Premises  (Special\r\n\r\nProvisions) Act. Section 7 (3) of the Act provides\r\n\r\nthat  the  total  amount  of  compensation  to  be\r\n\r\nawarded  in  a case where a tenant has sublet  his\r\n\r\npremises   must   not   exceed   the   amount   of\r\n\r\ncompensation that could be awarded in a case where\r\n\r\na  tenant has not so sublet his premises.  In  the\r\n\r\nworking  of  this legislation since the  Act  came\r\n\r\ninto  force,  the Tenants Compensation  Board  has\r\n\r\nfound  that this section is unduly restrictive  in\r\n\r\nenabling  the  Board to award fair and  reasonable\r\n\r\ncompensation  to tenants. The original  philosophy\r\n\r\nbehind  this  provision was that landlords  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  penalised  by  having  to  pay  out  more\r\n\r\ncompensation where tenants had sublet parts of the\r\n\r\ncontrolled premises; for, after all, landlords had\r\n\r\nover   the  years  derived  no  financial  benefit\r\n\r\nthemselves from the subletting. But the experience\r\n\r\nof  the  Board  has shown that this  approach  has\r\n\r\nfailed adequately to take into account the reality\r\n\r\nof  existing  economic  and social  conditions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order, therefore, for the Tenants\r\n\r\nCompensation Board to strike a fairer  balance  as\r\n\r\nbetween  landlords and tenants  in  the  award  of\r\n\r\ncompensation,  it is proposed that section  7  (3)\r\n\r\nshould  be deleted from the Act. While the  effect\r\n\r\nof  the  deletion  will be that landlords  may  be\r\n\r\nliable  under the law to pay out more compensation\r\n\r\nthan  might otherwise be the case, it will  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  dispossessed tenants will receive sufficient\r\n\r\ncompensation to enable them to set up new homes or\r\n\r\nbusinesses elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tenants Compensation Board has also proposed\r\n\r\nan  amendment  to give the Board  power  to  award\r\n\r\ncompensation to any person (other than a tenant or\r\n\r\nsubtenant)  using or occupying  any  part  of  the\r\n\r\ncontrolled  premises.  Such  occupiers   have   no\r\n\r\nprotection or standing under the Control  of  Rent\r\n\r\nAct,  upon which the Controlled Premises  (Special\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Act  hinges.  The  adoption  of  this\r\n\r\nproposal, therefore, entails widening the scope of\r\n\r\nthe  parent  Act in a way that was  not  envisaged\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Act was drafted. Although  the  concept\r\n\r\ndoes not lend itself to ready acceptability within\r\n\r\nthe narrow confines of property law, the Board  is\r\n\r\nconvinced  that social and economic considerations\r\n\r\njustify  the  adoption of this novel concept.  The\r\n\r\nproposal    has   principally   in   contemplation\r\n\r\noccupiers who are stall-holders selling  goods  or\r\n\r\nrefreshments  to the public under  an  arrangement\r\n\r\nwith  the  chief tenant. So long as it is  enacted\r\n\r\nthat  any  compensation that is payable  to  these\r\n\r\noccupiers comes out of the amount that is  payable\r\n\r\nto  the  person who has derived benefit  from  the\r\n\r\noccupation,  that is to say the  chief  tenant  in\r\n\r\nmost cases, the amendment can be justified on  the\r\n\r\nwider  social and economic grounds and  will  not,\r\n\r\nwithin  these limits, do too much violence to  the\r\n\r\nsettled  principles of property law. The amendment\r\n\r\ngiving effect to this proposal would appear  as  a\r\n\r\nnew section 9A in the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments in the Bill are of a\r\n\r\nconsequential or formal nature and do not call for\r\n\r\nspecial comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise to support the Amendment Bill\r\n\r\nmoved  by my colleague, the Minister for  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all agree that a large part of the\r\n\r\nCentral City areas is in need of renewal, as  many\r\n\r\nof  the  properties were built in the last century\r\n\r\nand  are now in a dilapidated condition. Some  are\r\n\r\neven unsafe for occupation, quite apart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom   health  considerations.  Thus,   when   the\r\n\r\nControlled Premises (Special Provisions)  Act  was\r\n\r\nintroduced   in  1969  to  remove  the  protection\r\n\r\naccorded  to tenants of controlled premises  under\r\n\r\nthe  Control  of Rent Ordinance so  as  to  enable\r\n\r\nredevelopment  to  take place, there  was  general\r\n\r\nsupport from the public. In fact, all agreed  that\r\n\r\nredevelopment of the Central City areas would  not\r\n\r\nonly  bring  greater  economic  opportunities  and\r\n\r\nemployment to the people of Singapore in  general,\r\n\r\nbut would also change Singapore into a modern City\r\n\r\nbefitting   its   status   as   a   regional   and\r\n\r\ninternational centre of communication,  trade  and\r\n\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the process, there is bound to be\r\n\r\nsome  dislocation and suffering  to  some  of  the\r\n\r\naffected tenants and subtenants, especially  those\r\n\r\nwho  depend  on  the  Telok  Ayer  Basin  and  the\r\n\r\nwaterfront for their livelihood. It is  only  fair\r\n\r\nand  just that they should be compensated to  make\r\n\r\ntheir  removal and resettlement in a new and  more\r\n\r\ndistant  environment more bearable.  It  would  be\r\n\r\ngrossly unjust if prosperity in one sector of  our\r\n\r\nsociety  should be built on the misery of  another\r\n\r\nsector,  albeit  a smaller one. Indeed,  this  was\r\n\r\ntaken  into  consideration  in  the  Act,  wherein\r\n\r\nprovisions  were made for the establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nTenants Compensation Board to ensure that fair and\r\n\r\nreasonable  compensation  shall  be  paid  by  the\r\n\r\nlandlord  or  developer to tenants  or  subtenants\r\n\r\naffected by urban renewal in the designated  area.\r\n\r\nThe  landlord  is offered generous concession  for\r\n\r\nundertaking urban renewal project in the  form  of\r\n\r\nlower property tax - 12 per cent as against 36 per\r\n\r\ncent.  A  landlord  who  can  commit  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  in  a redevelopment project  can  in  all\r\n\r\ncases  offer  a  fair  amount of  compensation  to\r\n\r\naffected  tenants  and  subtenants,  otherwise  he\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  in  the  business  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the short period since the Act was\r\n\r\nin  force,  it has been found that landlords  were\r\n\r\nfar  from  willing  to offer fair  and  reasonable\r\n\r\ncompensation to tenants and subtenants. They often\r\n\r\nexploited   the   ignorance  of   the   illiterate\r\n\r\nresidential tenants and subtenants.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  case I was informed, as I was then in America,\r\n\r\nthat  a  landlord even resorted to the  tactics  of\r\n\r\ndemolishing parts of a building in order  to  force\r\n\r\ntenants  in  another  part to  accept  unreasonable\r\n\r\nterms  of  compensation and move out for their  own\r\n\r\nsafety.  In  another instance, despite  the  strong\r\n\r\nrecommendation  made  by the  Tenants  Compensation\r\n\r\nBoard   for   enhanced  ex  gratia  payments,   the\r\n\r\nlandlord,  a  leading local bank, was unsympathetic\r\n\r\nto   the  claims  of  a  number  of  occupiers   in\r\n\r\ncontrolled  premises. The landlord was prepared  to\r\n\r\npay  only  a derisory sum of ex gratia to them.  It\r\n\r\nwas   only  through  the  intervention  of  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives that the bank eventually agreed  to\r\n\r\nincrease  ex  gratia payments to the occupiers.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  it  was  as a result of this case  that  the\r\n\r\npresent  amendments to section 9  were  introduced.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  if  landlords or developers,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose  with millions of dollars of assets, were  to\r\n\r\ntake  the lead and show a little sympathy  for  the\r\n\r\nplight  of  the poor, the present amendments  would\r\n\r\nnot have been necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to the credit of the Tenants Compensation\r\n\r\nBoard that, in the course of its deliberations,  it\r\n\r\nhas   adopted  a  liberal  attitude  and  has  been\r\n\r\nresponsive  to  the changing circumstances  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy and the Government's more liberal policy of\r\n\r\ncompensation  in  respect of its  own  resettlement\r\n\r\ncases. As the House is aware, since the coming into\r\n\r\nforce   of   the   Controlled   Premises   (Special\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Act  in  1969,  the  rent  of  private\r\n\r\nresidential  properties has gone  up  several-folds\r\n\r\nand well beyond the reach of tenants and subtenants\r\n\r\nin  controlled premises in the Golden Shoe area. As\r\n\r\na result, the demand for public housing has shot up\r\n\r\nto  an  all time high so much so that, despite  the\r\n\r\nrecord  annual output of 16,000 units per annum  by\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and  Development  Board,  the  demand\r\n\r\ncannot be met promptly. Today, an applicant has  to\r\n\r\nwait an average of about three years before he  can\r\n\r\nobtain a fiat, either on rent or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npurchase.  This  is  a  factor  which  the  Tenants\r\n\r\nCompensation   Board  will  have   to   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration   in   deciding   the   quantum    of\r\n\r\ncompensation  as the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nhas  become  the  only source of  supply  of  cheap\r\n\r\nhousing within the reach of the poor living in  the\r\n\r\nGolden  Shoe  area.  My personal  view  is  that  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  minimum  amount of compensation  for  a\r\n\r\nresidential tenant or subtenant as of today,  shall\r\n\r\nbe  in  the  region of $5,000 or  18  years'  rent,\r\n\r\nwhichever  is the greater amount, not  taking  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  other  relevant  factors   such   as\r\n\r\nremoval  costs, location and siting  of  controlled\r\n\r\npremises, hardship, etc. 1 have no doubt  that  the\r\n\r\nTenants Compensation Board appreciates the position\r\n\r\nand  will know how to exercise discretion  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour, for his support.

I  have\r\n\r\nalso stated that during the operations of the  Act\r\n\r\na   critical  assessment  would  be  made  of  its\r\n\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Abortion Act and the Voluntary\r\n\r\nSterilization  Act have been in operation  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  two years. Experience gained has shown  that\r\n\r\nthe  Abortion Act has been operating smoothly  and\r\n\r\nfulfilling  its  purpose. Since  its  coming  into\r\n\r\noperation  till  the end of December  1971,  about\r\n\r\n5,300  abortions have been carried out.  The  vast\r\n\r\nmajority of the abortions were done on women  with\r\n\r\nunwanted  pregnancies who have a large  number  of\r\n\r\nchildren  and belong to the low income group.  The\r\n\r\nAbortion  Act  can  be  said  to  have  more  than\r\n\r\nfulfilled  the objectives for which  the  Act  had\r\n\r\nbeen passed. The same, however, cannot be said  of\r\n\r\nthe  Voluntary Sterilization Act. During the  same\r\n\r\nperiod,  only  1,639 sterilizations  were  carried\r\n\r\nout.  This  is a pity since sterilization  is  the\r\n\r\nbest  method  of  family planning  for  those  who\r\n\r\ncompleted the number of children they want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the figures I gave a moment ago, it can be\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the number of abortions performed  was\r\n\r\nmore than three times the number of sterilizations\r\n\r\nover  the same period. This is because the  demand\r\n\r\nfor sterilization has been hampered by a number of\r\n\r\nrestrictions  in the Voluntary Sterilization  Act.\r\n\r\nSome of these restrictions are connected with  the\r\n\r\nprocedure in applying for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsterilizations;  others with the  conditions  that\r\n\r\nhave  to be satisfied before sterilization can  be\r\n\r\napproved   under   the  Act.  It  is,   therefore,\r\n\r\nconsidered desirable to amend the Act suitably  so\r\n\r\nthat  it  will serve its purpose well, namely,  to\r\n\r\nmake   sterilization,  as  a  method   of   family\r\n\r\nplanning,  easily available to  as  many  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  who  come  within  its  ambit.  Hence,  the\r\n\r\npresent Bill before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Voluntary Sterilization Act, every\r\n\r\napplicant has to appear before the Eugenics  Board\r\n\r\nfor an interview. This is a mandatory provision of\r\n\r\nthe  law  as  it  stands, and  the  Board  has  no\r\n\r\ndiscretion  in  the  matter. The  purpose  of  the\r\n\r\ninterview  is  to  explain to  the  applicant  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  and  consequences of  sterilization.  The\r\n\r\nreason  underlying this provision  is  that  every\r\n\r\napplicant  should be clearly aware  of  the  steps\r\n\r\nbeing taken so that he or she will not enter  into\r\n\r\nit   unknowingly,   or  under  false   ideas   nor\r\n\r\nfrivolously - to be regretted when it is too  late\r\n\r\nat a later date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes good intentions have a way of\r\n\r\nachieving  unexpected results.  But  one  of  them\r\n\r\nmight have been foreseen. This is that many of the\r\n\r\napplicants  find  it an embarrassment  to  present\r\n\r\nthemselves  before  the Board for  the  interview.\r\n\r\nMany  have refused to attend the interviews  after\r\n\r\nthey  had  made their applications. How many  more\r\n\r\nhave   not  made  applications  for  sterilization\r\n\r\nbecause  of this requirement will never be  known.\r\n\r\nBecause of this one reason, this important  method\r\n\r\nof  contraception for family planning  is  not  as\r\n\r\npopular as it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other reasons too, which make the\r\n\r\nrigid  requirement for the interview  undesirable,\r\n\r\none  of which is that hardship is caused to  those\r\n\r\napplicants  in the lower income group  (the  large\r\n\r\nmajority of applicants are in this group) who live\r\n\r\naway  from  the City, particularly  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  in  that they have to take time  off  from\r\n\r\nwork, perhaps losing a day's wages and spend money\r\n\r\non  transport  to attend the Board's interview  at\r\n\r\nthe Kandang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKerbau  Hospital. As a result of  this  compulsory\r\n\r\ninterview,  the  Board has, to meet  regularly  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  all applicants. In view of  the  large\r\n\r\nnumber of applicants received - about 150 a  month\r\n\r\n-  the  Board  at  present meets  weekly.  It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, considered desirable that the  question\r\n\r\nwhether an applicant is to be interviewed  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard   or  otherwise  be  left  to  the   Board's\r\n\r\ndiscretion  and  provision  to  this  effect   has\r\n\r\naccordingly  been made in the Amendment  Bill.  In\r\n\r\nother words, the Board will decide on the basis of\r\n\r\nthe   information  contained  in  the  application\r\n\r\nwhether a person should be called for interview or\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every applicant whose application for\r\n\r\nsterilization  has been approved and  who  is  not\r\n\r\nrequired  by the Board to appear for an  interview\r\n\r\nwill  be notified by post. As a safeguard  and  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  applicant  to  have  a  full  medical\r\n\r\nexplanation,  he  or she will be provided  with  a\r\n\r\nleaflet,  in the appropriate language,  explaining\r\n\r\nthe  meaning and consequences of sterilization  so\r\n\r\nthat  he  or she will be fully aware of  the  step\r\n\r\nintended  to  be  taken. This  leaflet  has, been\r\n\r\nprepared  in  four languages and has been  in  use\r\n\r\nsince  December 1970. In this connection, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  mention that the staff  of  the  various\r\n\r\nhospitals and maternity and child health  clinics,\r\n\r\nwhere most applicants go t& get application forms,\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  give  an  explanation  of  the\r\n\r\nmeaning and, consequences of sterilization to  the\r\n\r\napplicants as they have been doing hitherto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, at least 30 days are required to\r\n\r\nelapse between the date of the application and the\r\n\r\ndate  sterilization is to be carried out. This  is\r\n\r\nintended  as  a  safeguard in case  the  applicant\r\n\r\nchanges his mind, when it would have acted against\r\n\r\nthe basic purpose of the law. The need for such  a\r\n\r\nlong waiting period has been criticised. Many are.\r\n\r\nunable  to  understand the  need  for  the  delay.\r\n\r\nIndeed, many applicants have indicated a desire to\r\n\r\nbe   sterilized  immediately  after  the   Board's\r\n\r\ninterview.  It  is  known that some  women  became\r\n\r\npregnant during the waiting period. An\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment to shorten the waiting period  from  30\r\n\r\ndays  to  7  days has, therefore, been made.  The\r\n\r\nsafeguard  is  retained, only the period  between\r\n\r\nthe approval and when the sterilization operation\r\n\r\ncan  be carried out has been shortened. There can\r\n\r\nbe  no  undue  haste  in  taking  this  important\r\n\r\ndecision, yet it should not be unduly long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present one of the conditions that every\r\n\r\napplicant  must  satisfy before  the  Board  will\r\n\r\nauthorise treatment for sterilization is that  he\r\n\r\nor  she  must  have at least three  children.  In\r\n\r\nother words, the present position is that parents\r\n\r\nwho  have  decided that their family is  complete\r\n\r\nwith    two   children   cannot   benefit    from\r\n\r\nsterilization and would have to adhere  to  other\r\n\r\ncontraceptive  methods  for  the  rest  of  their\r\n\r\nlives.  It  is  an  undesirable hardship  on  the\r\n\r\nmarriage partners. It is inconvenient and can  be\r\n\r\nexpensive,   and  further,  other   contraceptive\r\n\r\nmethods are not 100 per cent effective and  there\r\n\r\nis   the   ever-present  fear  of   an   unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancy.  After looking into this  matter  very\r\n\r\ncarefully,  it  is  considered  that   there   is\r\n\r\njustification  in liberalising the  law  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.  Accordingly, the present requirement  of\r\n\r\nthree  children has been reduced to two  and  the\r\n\r\nBill gives effect to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is also provided that where there\r\n\r\nare  exceptional  circumstances,  the  Board  may\r\n\r\napprove sterilization in the case of an applicant\r\n\r\nwith   one   living   child.   The   \"exceptional\r\n\r\ncircumstances\" may be on medical, therapeutic  or\r\n\r\nenvironmental grounds. The last mentioned  ground\r\n\r\nincludes  the  financial and social circumstances\r\n\r\nof the applicant. Any application under this head\r\n\r\nwill  naturally be scrutinized by the Board  with\r\n\r\nthe utmost care, and approval would be given only\r\n\r\nif  the Board is satisfied, having regard to  all\r\n\r\nthe    circumstances,   that   there   is    real\r\n\r\njustification. Each case will depend on  its  own\r\n\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law allows the Board to approve\r\n\r\nsterilization  in the case of a person  under  21\r\n\r\nyears  of  age if he is suffering from hereditary\r\n\r\nillness  that  is  recurrent, mental  illness  or\r\n\r\nepilepsy, and if his parent or guardian  consents\r\n\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis precludes unmarried persons over 21 years of\r\n\r\nage  and married persons of any age from applying\r\n\r\nfor  sterilization  if they  are  suffering  from\r\n\r\nthese  illnesses. The Bill seeks to remedy  this.\r\n\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Eugenics Board has no powers to\r\n\r\nappoint  committees for any general  or  specific\r\n\r\npurpose  or to authorise them to do any  specific\r\n\r\nact  or  carry  out any specific  function.  Such\r\n\r\npowers have been provided for the Termination  of\r\n\r\nPregnancy Authorization Board under the  Abortion\r\n\r\nAct.  It  is considered that there is a need  for\r\n\r\nsimilar  powers for the Eugenics Board. Clause  2\r\n\r\nof the Bill gives effect to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dealt with the main\r\n\r\namendments   proposed  in  the  Bill   and   have\r\n\r\nexplained  why  they  are  necessary.

It was indicated that though there  are\r\n\r\nencouraging  signs of success in  our  efforts  in\r\n\r\npromoting  tourism,  we still  need  an  intensive\r\n\r\nprogramme  to .attract more tourists to Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  programme  would  include  the  laying  of  a\r\n\r\ntourist   infra-structure  by  the  provision   of\r\n\r\nadditional  amenities  and  facilities   and   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  projects  which  would  help   to\r\n\r\nencourage  a  greater  flow  of  tourists  and  to\r\n\r\nincrease the length of their stay in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government decided as early as 1969 to\r\n\r\ndevelop   Sentosa   as   a  tourist   resort.   An\r\n\r\ninternationally known firm was asked  subsequently\r\n\r\nto study the feasibility of so developing Sentosa.\r\n\r\nThis study, which was completed in September 1970,\r\n\r\nconfirmed that the proposal was a viable  one  and\r\n\r\nthat   it   would  play  an  important   role   in\r\n\r\nsubstantially  increasing the rate  of  growth  of\r\n\r\ntourists  coming to Singapore. The study envisaged\r\n\r\nthat  the  development of Sentosa into  a  tourist\r\n\r\nresort would require Government investment to  the\r\n\r\nextent of $68 million spread over a period of nine\r\n\r\nyears  until  the whole project is completed.  The\r\n\r\nprivate   sector  too  is  expected  to  play   an\r\n\r\nimportant  role  by investing about  $56  million.\r\n\r\nThese   sums  will  have  to  be  spent   on   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of infra-structure and the creation of\r\n\r\nfacilities for tourist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattraction.  The  proposals  include  a   vacation\r\n\r\ncomplex  comparable  to the  best  in  the  world,\r\n\r\ncentralised   shopping  facilities,   recreational\r\n\r\namenities  such  as  a  golf course,  an  open-air\r\n\r\ntheatre, a gun museum, a maritime museum, a marine\r\n\r\ncomplex  consisting  of a corallarium,  a  pirates\r\n\r\ncove,  and  an aquarium, together with first-class\r\n\r\nhotels  and restaurants. In the creation of  these\r\n\r\nfacilities,  the greatest care will  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  there  will be no  conflict  between\r\n\r\ntourist   facilities   on  Sentosa   and   tourist\r\n\r\nfacilities  on  the  mainland.  I  should  mention\r\n\r\nperhaps  that,  in  fact, a few of  the  essential\r\n\r\nprojects  such as the golf course, the  cable  car\r\n\r\nand beach facilities are already in various stages\r\n\r\nof implementation. It is anticipated that by March\r\n\r\n1973,  there  should  be adequate  attractions  on\r\n\r\nSentosa to make a visit to the island worthwhile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be appreciated from the above remarks\r\n\r\nthat   the  development  of  Sentosa  is  a  major\r\n\r\nundertaking. This requires the establishment of  a\r\n\r\npermanent  organisation which will be  responsible\r\n\r\nnot  only  for the implementation of the  numerous\r\n\r\nprojects but also for the efficient administration\r\n\r\nof the island after the expected completion of all\r\n\r\nprojects  by  1979. It is, therefore, proposed  in\r\n\r\nthe Bill now before the House that there should be\r\n\r\nestablished a Sentosa Development Corporation with\r\n\r\nresponsibilities    for    the     control     and\r\n\r\nadministration of Sentosa, and for the development\r\n\r\nof  services  and amenities for tourists  and  the\r\n\r\npublic.  This  will  reduce the burden  shouldered\r\n\r\nhitherto  by various Government Departments  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Jurong  Town Corporation  and  the  Urban\r\n\r\nRenewal  Department which, despite their stretched\r\n\r\nresources, have hitherto been responsible for  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the initial projects on Sentosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sentosa Development Corporation will be\r\n\r\nplaced   under   the  guidance  of  the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Division of the Ministry of  Finance,\r\n\r\nunder  whose  purview is the  development  of  our\r\n\r\ntourist industry.

The Bill,  which\r\n\r\nis  now  before the House, is necessary  since  the\r\n\r\nprevious  legislation, which I  mentioned  earlier,\r\n\r\ncannot  be suitably amended to increase the  amount\r\n\r\nof loan that can be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill follows closely the provisions of the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Loan Act, l967 (Chapter 66),  with  one\r\n\r\ndifference. This is that the maximum amount of loan\r\n\r\nwhich  can  be  raised under  the  Bill  is  $2,000\r\n\r\nmillion,  as compared to $1,000 million  authorised\r\n\r\nby the 1967 Act. A new feature is that the proposed\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Loan Act will be administered  by  the\r\n\r\nMonetary  Authority  of Singapore  instead  of  the\r\n\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Tang See Chim].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY BOARD BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of raising productivity in\r\n\r\nSingapore stems from basic economic realities.  We\r\n\r\nare a small country in terms of our population and\r\n\r\nthe natural resources we possess. Indeed, our only\r\n\r\nnatural  resources  are  our  resourceful  working\r\n\r\npopulation, our geographical location and  a  fine\r\n\r\nharbour.   While  other  countries  have  abundant\r\n\r\nmineral  deposits to exploit, we have none.  While\r\n\r\nother countries have vast, fertile tracts of  land\r\n\r\nto  till,  we  have none. We can build  a  healthy\r\n\r\neconomy  and enjoy a high standard of living  only\r\n\r\nupon  the  productivity  and  discipline  of   our\r\n\r\nworking  population, including both  the  managing\r\n\r\nand  the  managed in both the public  and  private\r\n\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other populous countries, we do not even\r\n\r\nhave a large, guaranteed, domestic market for  our\r\n\r\nlocally-made products. Given our limited  domestic\r\n\r\nmarket  of 2.1 million persons, in order to attain\r\n\r\nour targeted Gross Domestic Product growth rate of\r\n\r\n15  per cent annually over the next five years, we\r\n\r\nsimply  must  export  more  and  more.  To  secure\r\n\r\nmarkets  for  our  exports, we  must  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncompete internationally in terms of the price  and\r\n\r\nquality  of  our  products.  And  to  do  so   our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,  industrialists and workers  must  be\r\n\r\nefficient and productive. The importance,  indeed,\r\n\r\nthe necessity of raising productivity in Singapore\r\n\r\ncan never be overemphasised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, increases in productivity make\r\n\r\npossible  wage  increases  without  upsetting  the\r\n\r\neconomic  apple-cart. Many of our workers  in  the\r\n\r\npast  have worked conscientiously, diligently  and\r\n\r\nwith  the welfare of the nation at heart. Not only\r\n\r\ndo  they  deserve our thanks, in this decade  they\r\n\r\nshould  enjoy higher wages. However, higher  wages\r\n\r\nwithout accompanying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproductivity increases can impede economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.  Fundamentally, the  businessman  is  more\r\n\r\ninterested in his labour cost per unit  of  output\r\n\r\nrather than wages as such. If the productivity  of\r\n\r\nhis  employees  rises, he can  raise  their  wages\r\n\r\nwithout simultaneously increasing his unit  labour\r\n\r\ncost.   Through  higher  productivity  then,   the\r\n\r\naspirations of our workers for higher wages can be\r\n\r\nmet   without  inflation,  without  damaging   the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  of our products in  international\r\n\r\nmarkets,  and  without reducing the attractiveness\r\n\r\nof   our   investment  climate.  I  repeat   --the\r\n\r\nnecessity   to  raise  productivity  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot be over-emphasised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Centre was established\r\n\r\nin May 1967, within the Economic Development Board\r\n\r\nas  a result of a joint declaration signed by  the\r\n\r\nNational  Trades  Union  Congress,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers'    Federation   and    the    Singapore\r\n\r\nManufacturers' Association. In July last year, the\r\n\r\nNational Productivity Centre was transferred  from\r\n\r\nthe Economic Development Board to my Ministry.  It\r\n\r\nhad  always been envisaged that after the National\r\n\r\nProductivity   Centre   had  acquired   sufficient\r\n\r\nexperience  and  expertise, its  status  would  be\r\n\r\nraised  to that of a statutory board. Having  been\r\n\r\nin  existence  for  almost  five  years  now,  and\r\n\r\nbearing   in   mind  the  importance  of   raising\r\n\r\nproductivity, it is opportune to transform it into\r\n\r\na statutory board now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to go into the\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the Bill as regards the aims,  powers\r\n\r\nand  functions of the National Productivity  Board\r\n\r\nas  these are clearly indicated in the Explanatory\r\n\r\nStatement to the Bill. I shall only point out some\r\n\r\nof the salient features of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the\r\n\r\nappointment of a 14-member board consisting of the\r\n\r\nchairman,  three directors each to  represent  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, employers, trade unions, academic  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  bodies associated with productivity,\r\n\r\nand  an  Executive Director. This equal and  broad\r\n\r\nrepresentation will help the Board to better serve\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfelt needs of different groups in our society  and\r\n\r\nto  better  elicit their support in  the  task  of\r\n\r\nraising productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fundamental task of the\r\n\r\nNational Productivity Board is to raise the  level\r\n\r\nof   productivity  in  Singapore.   Its   specific\r\n\r\nobjectives  are set out in clause 6 of  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nthe more important of which are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to promote productivity consciousness\r\n\r\namongst  management personnel, trade union leaders\r\n\r\nand workers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to provide training facilities for\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  trade  unions  personnel  in  all\r\n\r\nproductivity    techniques,   including    general\r\n\r\nmanagement,   personnel  management,   supervisory\r\n\r\ndevelopment, management accounting and  industrial\r\n\r\nengineering;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to foster and promote good industrial\r\n\r\nrelations   by  training  and  by  promoting   the\r\n\r\nformation of joint consultative councils;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) to render management consultancy services\r\n\r\nin  the  same fields in which training  activities\r\n\r\nare undertaken with a view to assisting industrial\r\n\r\nenterprises  to  achieve  a  general  raising   of\r\n\r\nproductivity; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) to assist industrial establishments in\r\n\r\nformulating  and rationalising wage  policies  and\r\n\r\nwage systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the objectives of the Board will\r\n\r\nbe  achieved, it is also empowered in clause 7  to\r\n\r\npublish    works   and   disseminate   information\r\n\r\nconcerning  productivity  techniques,   to   award\r\n\r\ncertificates  of  efficiency to persons  attending\r\n\r\ncourses  organised by the Board and to  establish,\r\n\r\nunder clause 6, a scheme of subscribing membership\r\n\r\nto the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  wish to express my views on the  National\r\n\r\nProductivity Board Bill which are purely those  of\r\n\r\na  common man. Sir, I therefore beg the indulgence\r\n\r\nof the economists and other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintellectuals to bear with the viewpoints  of  the\r\n\r\ncommon  man, which I now express. The  common  man\r\n\r\nbelieves that if he works, and works hard  enough,\r\n\r\nhe  is entitled to a fair wage and a bonus out  of\r\n\r\nthe  fruits of his labour. The average man's basic\r\n\r\nphilosophy   towards  work  and  the  purpose   of\r\n\r\nproduction  as  an extrapolation  of  work  is  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy   his  own  welfare  and  those  whom   he\r\n\r\nconsiders are part of society. I hope the National\r\n\r\nProductivity Board, when it proceeds in furthering\r\n\r\nits  objective,  will endeavour  to  simplify  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of productivity in terms of job  security\r\n\r\nand  satisfaction and a better standard  of  life.\r\n\r\nThe  average worker could hardly feel  secure  and\r\n\r\nhappy if it were otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the time being I would like\r\n\r\nto  express  my  views on the subject  in  simple,\r\n\r\nrounded terms.  I hope over the years I could have\r\n\r\nthe opportunity of elaborating my viewpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not but agree that this is a vitally\r\n\r\nopportune   time  to  introduce  the  concept   of\r\n\r\nproductivity in the process of production  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  process of distribution of wealth in  a  just\r\n\r\nand  logical mode and manner. Therefore, I support\r\n\r\nthe  establishment  of  the National  Productivity\r\n\r\nBoard   whose   main   purpose   is   to   promote\r\n\r\nproductivity  in  all enterprises   industrial  or\r\n\r\notherwise     for   the  general  well-being   and\r\n\r\neconomic progress of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already accepted as a fact of life that\r\n\r\nSingapore  does  depend  on  foreign  investments,\r\n\r\nforeign  raw  materials  for  its  industries  and\r\n\r\nforeign   markets  for  our  manufactured   goods.\r\n\r\nPractically all that we have is abundance of human\r\n\r\nresources,  and there is no option but to  improve\r\n\r\nproductivity through better use of labour  through\r\n\r\ntime  and  space. In doing so, I hope the National\r\n\r\nProductivity Board will ensure the adoption of the\r\n\r\nfollowing working principles:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Productivity exercises should not cause job\r\n\r\ninsecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Productivity exercises should proceed through\r\n\r\nbargaining at grass-roots level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Productivity exercises should not endanger\r\n\r\nthe health and safety of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The employer must pay for the cost of\r\n\r\nretraining the employee when there is redundancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these conditions cannot be fulfilled, then\r\n\r\nall  productivity drives and plans will be  looked\r\n\r\nwith  suspicion,  cause  resentment,  frustration,\r\n\r\ndiscord and conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other pertinent point I wish to make is that\r\n\r\nthe  National Productivity Board should  not  take\r\n\r\nupon  itself the ultimate of knowing the  absolute\r\n\r\ntruth and solutions to all problems and to proceed\r\n\r\nby setting guide lines and recommendations without\r\n\r\ndue  consultation  with both individual  employers\r\n\r\nand workers and their organisations. No amount  of\r\n\r\nfirm orders or benign decrees, even lawfully given\r\n\r\nafter  this  Bill  is  passed,  will  create  good\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations and human happiness  in  the\r\n\r\nlong  run.  Democracy must be practised at  grass-roots  level in the best principles of  industrial\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will recall, Sir, I said in Parliament on\r\n\r\n11th  July,  1968,  when the   House  debated  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill in 1968 [Hansard, Volume  27,  No.\r\n\r\n10 cols. 535-61]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The question of increasing productivity in any\r\n\r\nfirm   or   undertaking   and   the   payment   of\r\n\r\nproductivity  rewards  can  also  be  worked   out\r\n\r\nbetween   the   particular  employer,   employees'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  and  the  National   Productivity\r\n\r\nCouncil.  There must be the machinery for  working\r\n\r\nout  productivity plans, examining the results and\r\n\r\nfor negotiating the payment of incentive awards to\r\n\r\nmake   any   productivity   drive   achieve    its\r\n\r\nobjectives.    The    question    of    increasing\r\n\r\nproductivity is an urgent matter and should be  of\r\n\r\nserious  concern to employers, Government, workers\r\n\r\nand   their  organisations  in  the  interest   of\r\n\r\neconomic progress. In this respect, if workers are\r\n\r\nasked to give their wholehearted support to higher\r\n\r\nproductivity programmes and campaigns,  they  must\r\n\r\nbe    allowed   to   participate   actively    and\r\n\r\nconstructively  in  formulating  and  implementing\r\n\r\nthem. When there is success there must be concrete\r\n\r\nand reasonable returns or rewards.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my thinking then as it is now that it is\r\n\r\nillogical and beyond comprehension that payment of\r\n\r\nbonus  to  workers,  a vital incentive  to  higher\r\n\r\nproductivity, is negotiable only within a  certain\r\n\r\nrestricted limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see there is provision to foster and promote\r\n\r\ngood industrial relations through the formation of\r\n\r\njoint   consultative  councils  as  one   of   the\r\n\r\nobjectives of the National Productivity  Board.  I\r\n\r\ndo  hope  that it will be within the  province  of\r\n\r\nsuch  joint  consultative  councils  not  only  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  and  to implement agreed work procedures,\r\n\r\nbut  also to look into the question of the payment\r\n\r\nof  productivity bonuses, provided, however,  they\r\n\r\nrepresent the will of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this point I would like to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  idea of forming joint productivity\r\n\r\ncouncils  in  enterprises, which  would  serve  as\r\n\r\nconsultative   bodies   guiding   and    promoting\r\n\r\nproductivity,  is not new. In 1965, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers'      Federation,     the      Singapore\r\n\r\nManufacturers' Association and the National Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress  at the behest of  the  Government\r\n\r\njointly   endorsed  the  Charter  for   Industrial\r\n\r\nProductivity Code of Practice. Unfortunately, this\r\n\r\nCharter,  which was solemnly contracted,  was  not\r\n\r\nreligiously practised in spirit and in real terms.\r\n\r\nThis  Charter is nothing but a dead letter. I hope\r\n\r\nthe  National Productivity Board will pick up  the\r\n\r\nfallen threads, but not tread the same path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also observe that among its objectives,\r\n\r\nthe   National  Productivity  Board  shall  assist\r\n\r\nindustrial  establishments  and  trade  unions  in\r\n\r\nformulating  and rationalising wage  policies  and\r\n\r\nwage  systems;  shall assist the  Government  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time in shaping a national wage  policy;\r\n\r\nand shall undertake manpower and wage studies.  On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, the Minister for Labour has on 8th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1972,  constituted the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  with somewhat similar terms of reference,\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To assist in the formulation of general guide-lines on wage policy;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To recommend necessary adjustment in wage\r\n\r\nstructure,  with  a view to developing  a  coherent\r\n\r\nwage system consistent with long-term economic  and\r\n\r\nsocial development;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To advise on desirable incentive systems\r\n\r\nfor  the  promotion of operational  efficiency  and\r\n\r\nproductivity in various enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister for Labour clarify if the Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  is to operate as a body separate from  the\r\n\r\nNational Productivity Board or as an adjunct to the\r\n\r\nBoard?  Or will the Wages Council be subsidiary  to\r\n\r\nthe  National  Productivity Board? Or  will  it  be\r\n\r\nunscrambled?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister For Labour will consider\r\n\r\nthe  last  point because if he has  too  many  dons\r\n\r\naround him, sometimes they become boisterous.  They\r\n\r\ndo  not  write a one-and-a-half page memorandum  to\r\n\r\nthe  Cabinet.  I  tend to think that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  might be confused, and we all will  suffer\r\n\r\nin the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I share the\r\n\r\nsympathy  of the Member for Kallang in  respect  of\r\n\r\nhis   apprehension  and  fear  that  the  increased\r\n\r\nproductivity  may lead to loss of job security  for\r\n\r\nworkers,  may endanger the safety of workers  while\r\n\r\nat work, and so forth. It is, in fact, to meet this\r\n\r\nkind   of   reservation   that   there   will    be\r\n\r\nrepresentations  from  the  trade  unions  on   the\r\n\r\nNational Productivity Board itself. I am quite sure\r\n\r\nthe  trade union representatives on the Board  will\r\n\r\nbe  competent enough to safeguard the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the question of bonus payments, as\r\n\r\nI  have said earlier during the Budget debate,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  question of bonus payment and the amount  of\r\n\r\nbonus  negotiable is being referred to the National\r\n\r\nWages Council for deliberation. The Government  has\r\n\r\nmade  known its views to the National Wages Council\r\n\r\nregarding this matter, and we are waiting  for  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations. I think the Member for Kallang  is\r\n\r\nwell aware that the recommendations of the Wages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil will only be ready around the end of  April\r\n\r\nor  early May. So I ask him to be a little bit more\r\n\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can really be no conflict arising between\r\n\r\nthe   National  Wages  Council  and  the   National\r\n\r\nProductivity Board, because the Board is, in  fact,\r\n\r\nservicing the National Wages Council. The  National\r\n\r\nWages Council is purely an advisory body which will\r\n\r\nsubmit reports and recommendations periodically  to\r\n\r\nthe   Government  on  wages  and  guide-lines   for\r\n\r\nimplementation by the Government and  the  `various\r\n\r\nemployer  organisations. In servicing the  National\r\n\r\nWages   Council,  I  am  quite  sure  the  National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Board will be able to assist  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious ways of formulating such guide-lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SECURITY CORPORATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to establish the Commercial and\r\n\r\nIndustrial Security Corporation to take over  on  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  basis the functions of  the  Guard  and\r\n\r\nEscort Unit constituted under the Police Force  Act\r\n\r\nin  providing for guards and escorts as a  security\r\n\r\nservice to the commercial and industrial sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guard and Escort Unit was formed in 1959 from\r\n\r\nthe  ranks of the old Special Constabulary  and  at\r\n\r\nthe   outset   consisted  of  the  Commandant,   11\r\n\r\nInspectors and 800 Special Constables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   Union  performs  a  wide  range  of   duties\r\n\r\nincluding:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) guard for important personages;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) escorts for payroll and the delivery of\r\n\r\ncash;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) static property and building guards; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) ship guards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit was constituted primarily for the\r\n\r\npurpose   of  providing  guards  and  escorts   to\r\n\r\nGovernment   Departments,  thereby   leaving   the\r\n\r\nregular  policemen to deal with matters pertaining\r\n\r\nto  the preservation of public peace and order. In\r\n\r\naddition, the Unit also contributes towards  crime\r\n\r\nprevention by offering its services to the private\r\n\r\nsector on payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the Guard and Escort Unit providing a\r\n\r\nsecurity  service to the commercial and industrial\r\n\r\nsectors, there are also a number of other  private\r\n\r\nfirms    in   the   security   business.   Despite\r\n\r\ncompetition from these firms, the Guard and Escort\r\n\r\nUnit  netted about $2.1 million and $2 million  in\r\n\r\nrevenue  for the years 1970 and 1971 respectively.\r\n\r\nThis amount was earned by deploying only one-third\r\n\r\nof  the  manpower,  as the other  two-thirds  were\r\n\r\ndeployed  for  unpaid  duties  and  administrative\r\n\r\nwork.  It is, therefore, evident that the services\r\n\r\nof  this  Unit  are heavily in demand  and  it  is\r\n\r\nenvisaged that the trend would continue well  into\r\n\r\nthe  future.  With  this  in  view,  the  National\r\n\r\nProductivity Centre was requested in October 1970,\r\n\r\nto  study  the feasibility of expanding the  Guard\r\n\r\nand Escort Unit on a commercial basis. The finding\r\n\r\nof  the National Productivity Centre is that it is\r\n\r\na viable project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the payroll and cash-in-transit\r\n\r\nrobberies occurred because of no security  guards.\r\n\r\nOn  4th  September, 1971, five  employees  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Woollen Knitwear (Private)  Limited  in\r\n\r\nJurong, including two female payroll clerks,  were\r\n\r\nrobbed  of a sum of about $45,000 at Quality  Road\r\n\r\nwhile  on  their way back to the factory from  the\r\n\r\nbank.  The  firm  probably felt  that  since  five\r\n\r\npersons  were accompanying the payroll it was  not\r\n\r\nnecessary to have security guards to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nescort  the cash-in-transit.
