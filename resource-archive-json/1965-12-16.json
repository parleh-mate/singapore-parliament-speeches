When we announced our intention\r\n\r\nto   resume  barter  trade  with  Indonesia,  they\r\n\r\nstepped in and objected to the scheme, giving  the\r\n\r\nflimsiest reasons for their objection. Is this not\r\n\r\na  blatant interference with our internal affairs?\r\n\r\nThey   claimed  that  resumption  of  trade   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  even  though on a small  scale,  would\r\n\r\njeopardise the security of Malaysia. But everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  their  own traders  are  carrying  on\r\n\r\nbarter trade in Tawau, Pulau Ketam -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P.

Events subsequent  to  that  date\r\n\r\nwhich  concern  the  Federation  of  Malaysia  are\r\n\r\nmatters  which should not he touched upon by  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.

This,\r\n\r\nI  think, is like the case of the Chinese  proverb\r\n\r\nwhich says that high officials are allowed to  set\r\n\r\nfire  to  a  town, but the common people  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  even to light a lamp in their own  house.\r\n\r\nIf  they  are  so concerned about the security  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and the security of Singapore,  then  it\r\n\r\nshould   he  their  duty  to  help  Singapore   to\r\n\r\nindustrialise, because a contented people will not\r\n\r\nso  easily  fall into the hands of the Communists.\r\n\r\nBut  instead  of doing this, they  clamp  down  on\r\n\r\ntrade  between Singapore and the Peninsula.

This tax  was  foolishly\r\n\r\nimposed  by the then Federal Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nIt  has  the ill-effect of discouraging  employers\r\n\r\nfrom  employing  more labourers that  we  have  in\r\n\r\nsurplus.  When we were in Malaysia, we opposed  it\r\n\r\nstrongly in Parliament. But since this has already\r\n\r\nbeen  imposed  on  us  and since  they  have  been\r\n\r\ncollecting  it for about a year, we do not  intend\r\n\r\nto  stop  it  yet.

We face\r\n\r\nthreats   from   the  Communists  and   the \r\n\r\npro-Communists,   as   represented  by   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  We  are  also facing intimidation  from\r\n\r\nreactionary    elements    as    represented    by\r\n\r\nconservative  forces in U.M.N.O., the  M.C.A. and\r\n\r\nthe M.I.C. Apart from that, we are also faced with\r\n\r\nintimidation from the remnants of the colonialists\r\n\r\nwho  carry out their evil machinations which  help\r\n\r\ntowards  the achievement of the ends of those  two\r\n\r\nforces mentioned earlier. They hope that Singapore\r\n\r\nwould fail in its effort to survive, and they work\r\n\r\nhard to damage the economy of the State. These are\r\n\r\nthe  people  who often shout out the  slogan  that\r\n\r\nSingapore will not survive without the cooperation\r\n\r\nof others, particularly Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our State has no desire to he an enemy of anyone,\r\n\r\nparticularly of our neighbour, Malaysia. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  desire of the Government of Singapore  is  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  co-operation with them, particularly  in\r\n\r\nthe  economic and commercial fields. But a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich  must be duly considered is that if economic\r\n\r\nco-operation is to be maintained with Malaysia, we\r\n\r\ndo   not   wish   any   Party,  particularly   the\r\n\r\nconservative  reactionaries  of  the   Right,   to\r\n\r\nimagine  that, without co-operation with Malaysia,\r\n\r\nSingapore will fall. Singapore can survive on  its\r\n\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have often heard U.M.N.O. leaders\r\n\r\nin  Singapore saying that for Singapore to  be  an\r\n\r\nindustrialised  State, it  must  depend  upon  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials from Malaya. What they mean to  say  is,\r\n\r\nhow is Singapore to become an industrialised State\r\n\r\nwithout  raw  materials such as  tin,  rubber  and\r\n\r\nother  raw  materials? I wish to say to them  that\r\n\r\nfor  us  to industrialise, raw materials  are  not\r\n\r\nimportant. Take, for instance, Japan. It does  not\r\n\r\nhave  iron  ore  or  rubber. Nevertheless,  it  is\r\n\r\nhighly industrialised and produces motor-cars  and\r\n\r\nother  manufactured goods for  their  people,  and\r\n\r\nthese goods are exported to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  of Malaysia. Malaysia, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nwhich has raw materials such as rubber and tin, is\r\n\r\nnot producing motor-cars and exporting them. It is\r\n\r\nnot   industrialising.  A  Singapore  without  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials need not necessarily mean that it cannot\r\n\r\nindustrialise.  On  the  other  hand,  although  a\r\n\r\ncountry  has  raw materials, it is not necessarily\r\n\r\nan industrialised country. So all the talk that to\r\n\r\nhe  an  industrialised State, the State must  have\r\n\r\nraw materials, is not exactly true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will prosper with its\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.  Daily  we  see  industrialists\r\n\r\nfrom foreign countries coming here to observe what\r\n\r\nis  going on in Jurong. Our people have been going\r\n\r\nto  Japan  and industrialists from Japan have  all\r\n\r\nsaid  that our economy is stable and they are keen\r\n\r\nto come and build factories here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country will prosper. I call upon all the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore to unite solidly behind  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, to work hard and be realistic in their\r\n\r\nattitude. By the will of God, we will succeed. The\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore will defend the rights  of\r\n\r\nthe  people,  irrespective of  race,  language  or\r\n\r\nreligion. It will defend the welfare and interests\r\n\r\nof  the  various  races  of Singapore.  All  these\r\n\r\nthings will be written in the new Constitution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Malays in Singapore need\r\n\r\nnot  fear that the P.A.P. Government will not look\r\n\r\nafter  their interests and welfare. The Government\r\n\r\nis  grateful  for the confidence  that  they  have\r\n\r\nplaced  in  it in the last general elections.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  Malays  in  Singapore  voted  for\r\n\r\nmembers  of the P.A.P. is an indication that  they\r\n\r\nhave full confidence in the P.A.P. Government.  We\r\n\r\nwill not betray their confidence placed in us.  We\r\n\r\nwill  defend and protect the interests and welfare\r\n\r\nof  them  all.  In  the  multi-racial  society  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, the Malays have a part to play. Let  us\r\n\r\nall,  irrespective  of race,  work  hard  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  prosperous and  happy  country.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government is working  hard  in  order  to\r\n\r\nbring   about  a  society  which  is   happy   and\r\n\r\nharmonious  because it is by this means  that  our\r\n\r\npeople will be able\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  live happily and in peace. That is the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy, while we were in Malaysia, we fought for such\r\n\r\na   society  through  the  call  for  a  Malaysian\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  But  because of that, we  were  evicted\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia. We must never forget the two years\r\n\r\nthat we were in Malaysia, and we believe that they\r\n\r\nin Malaysia will not forget that too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boycott of the Barisan Sosialis of this House\r\n\r\nclearly  shows that they have denied their  belief\r\n\r\nin democracy, and that all their fight in the past\r\n\r\nhas shown that they do not care for the future  of\r\n\r\nthe  country. Their absence from this House  shows\r\n\r\nthat   they  have  no  belief  and  no  confidence\r\n\r\nwhatever  in the system of democracy and they  are\r\n\r\nworking  very  hard to destroy it. The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  must be well aware of these actions  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, because the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  working very hard to destroy this  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem.  We know that they have now been  rejected\r\n\r\nby  the  people of Singapore and so are all  their\r\n\r\npro-Communist supporters. They, like U.M.N.O. and\r\n\r\nthe  M.C.A., have no political capital  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  show  to  the  people  of  Singapore.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Barisan Sosialis is a Party known for\r\n\r\nits skill in shouting slogans, but they are barren\r\n\r\nin  political  ideas. The slogans  are  all  empty\r\n\r\nones. In the Hong Lim by-election five months ago,\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  that constituency rejected  those\r\n\r\nslogans.  The  Barisan  Sosialis  people  are  now\r\n\r\nrejected both by their former supporters  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  this State. We know of the split  that\r\n\r\nhas  taken  place within the ranks of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  They have all along been dependent  for\r\n\r\ntheir  inspiration on the Communists of Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThey  are now like chickens. They are now  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of perishing. They are looking  for  help\r\n\r\nfrom  outside  in order to maintain  their  stand.\r\n\r\nThey  say that Malaysia is a neo-colonialist plot.\r\n\r\nThey  had wished earlier that Singapore would  not\r\n\r\nhave  merged with Malaysia. Now that Singapore  is\r\n\r\nno  longer  merged with Malaysia, this still  does\r\n\r\nnot  seem  to fulfi1 their desires. They say  that\r\n\r\nthe  independence that we have achieved is phoney.\r\n\r\nWhat  then are their true wishes? Merger is phoney\r\n\r\nand  independence is phoney! What they wish is  to\r\n\r\ndestroy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  so that it will perish.

The  whole  speech\r\n\r\nconveys  a sense of confidence both in the present\r\n\r\nand  in the future, and the concrete and effective\r\n\r\nsteps  to  be  taken in the solution  of  problems\r\n\r\nwhich confront the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is now well known and in fact accepted by\r\n\r\nall  our  fellow  member  nations  of  the  United\r\n\r\nNations Organisation but disputed by a few Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members who spit in the face of their own\r\n\r\nelectors,   Singapore  is   an   independent   and\r\n\r\nsovereign  country. So we meet  today  under  very\r\n\r\ndifferent circumstances from the past. We meet  as\r\n\r\nthe   First  Parliament  of  an  independent   and\r\n\r\nsovereign Republic of Singapore. I am proud of the\r\n\r\nfact; Honourable Members here present are proud of\r\n\r\nthe  fact; and I am sure the great majority of our\r\n\r\nfellow-citizens of Singapore share  our  pride  in\r\n\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the last Session, 21 guns did\r\n\r\nnot  boom  out  in salute when His Excellency  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara arrived at this Chamber  to\r\n\r\ndeliver  his  Speech,  but eight  days  ago,  they\r\n\r\nboomed  in  recognition of our  President.  Things\r\n\r\nhave  changed - changed dramatically. We  are  now\r\n\r\nmasters  of our own destiny. We did not seek  this\r\n\r\nstatus.  We did not separate from those  we  still\r\n\r\nfeel  are members of our common Malaysian  family.\r\n\r\nWe  were separated from them. This we accept.  But\r\n\r\nwe are an adult member of the family and can - and\r\n\r\nwill  -  survive on our own. We live  in  our  own\r\n\r\nhouses  but  also in the Malaysian  compound,  not\r\n\r\nfrom  any  decisions of men, but  because  of  the\r\n\r\ncompulsions  of history, geography and  sociology.\r\n\r\nAnd  for our own homeland, we have full and  final\r\n\r\nresponsibility. Our problems are not easy  and  we\r\n\r\nhave not all the time in the world to solve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem.  But  as the Prime Minister said, we  define\r\n\r\nour problems, the better to face them, and we face\r\n\r\nour  problems, in order to find better and quicker\r\n\r\nsolutions. We know that, though we must  take  the\r\n\r\ninitiative  and responsibility, we  need  the \r\n\r\nco-operation of others, our new neighbours, our \r\n\r\nAfro-Asian   friends,   our  fellow  members   of   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth, the new friends made  by  our  three\r\n\r\nMinisters on their recent journey of goodwill  and\r\n\r\nthe  people of the American continent -  in  fact,\r\n\r\nwherever friendship is. But for the first time, it\r\n\r\nis  our  opportunity and responsibility to  strive\r\n\r\nfor  the greatest advantage for our people. We are\r\n\r\non  test as a people and this is the greatest test\r\n\r\nwe  have  ever faced in the success story  of  our\r\n\r\nhistory. And this time it is a democratic test - a\r\n\r\ntest  of  all  of  us,  of our  capacity  to  hold\r\n\r\ntogether and to work together in the spirit  of  a\r\n\r\nmore  just and equal society, more equal not  only\r\n\r\nin  what we get from Singapore but in what we give\r\n\r\nto  it.  I  am glad that His Excellency has  fully\r\n\r\nbrought Out this point clearly in his Speech. What\r\n\r\nhe  has  said could bear repetition here, for  our\r\n\r\npeople  must fully realise their responsibilities.\r\n\r\nI  quote  \"Our survival as a people, depends  upon\r\n\r\nour     patience    and    resolution... upon     our\r\n\r\nperseverance.\"  In  other  words,  these  are  the\r\n\r\nqualities  needed to bring about a tolerant,  just\r\n\r\nand equal society, multi-racial, multi-lingual and\r\n\r\nmulti-religious. We have set our sights high.  The\r\n\r\nideas  and aspirations may not be new, but we  are\r\n\r\npioneers  in seeking to build them into  the  laws\r\n\r\nand  way  of  life  of  one  of  the  most  varied\r\n\r\ncommunities  in the world today. Every  effort  of\r\n\r\nevery  citizen  must be deliberately  directed  to\r\n\r\nachieve these ideals we have set ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cast our eyes around us and take an\r\n\r\nobjective look at our neighbours, their trials and\r\n\r\ntribulations, we can be certain that our policy is\r\n\r\nright.  Our leaders have done everything  for  the\r\n\r\nrealisation  of this policy. We have  learnt  from\r\n\r\nhistory.  We know that a tolerant, just and  equal\r\n\r\nsociety,  multi-racial, multi-lingual  and \r\n\r\nmulti-religious, are the four pillars of wisdom on which\r\n\r\nour nation can be built.

They are in our\r\n\r\nmidst  and they are constantly and obsessively  on\r\n\r\nthe  lookout for opportunities to exploit for  the\r\n\r\nadvancement  of  their  own  power  through  their\r\n\r\nideology.  They are constantly on the lookout  for\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  exploit the ignorant  and  \r\n\r\nill-informed. I am confident, however, that no  amount\r\n\r\nof  communal  terror  and intimidation  will  ever\r\n\r\nbring our people to forsake the conviction that  a\r\n\r\ntolerant,  just  and equal society,  multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual and multi-religious,  are  the  four\r\n\r\npillars  on  which our nation shall he built.  The\r\n\r\nmeans  they use to gain power indicate  the  means\r\n\r\nthey will use should they gain power to perpetuate\r\n\r\ntheir   power,  and  there  could  he  no  greater\r\n\r\ncontrast  with the ideals our Government  preaches\r\n\r\nand  practises. As His Excellency has  well  said,\r\n\r\n\"This  House  has  gone through many  a  struggle,\r\n\r\nfirst against Colonialism, then Communism and then\r\n\r\nCommunalism.\" Our people in their public  as  well\r\n\r\nas  in  their business and private life  are  much\r\n\r\nmore experienced and discerning people. We are  no\r\n\r\nfools.  It is because of this very fact  that  our\r\n\r\npeople  have a discriminatory mind and have  guts,\r\n\r\npatience  and  determination  that  other  nations\r\n\r\naccept us and respect us. I remember that when the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister spoke at the Airport on  his\r\n\r\nreturn  from  the  success of his recent  Goodwill\r\n\r\nMission overseas, he said that it was because  our\r\n\r\npeople  are  solidly behind our  nation's  leaders\r\n\r\nthat  other people arc prepared to be friends with\r\n\r\nus and respect us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a peace-loving people and it cannot be\r\n\r\nsaid  too often that we want to live in peace with\r\n\r\nour  neighbours and indeed with the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nworld. We want to prosper, and from our ideals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  our interests we want our neighbours also  to\r\n\r\nprosper. Let this be proclaimed from the roof-tops\r\n\r\nthat  it may be known to our neighbours as  t  was\r\n\r\nstated  by our Foreign Minister in his key  speech\r\n\r\nto  the United Nations Assembly. Let us co-operate\r\n\r\nin  all  things  for the benefit of  our  peoples,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the purpose of politics.  Let  not  our\r\n\r\nminds  and  thoughts  be  clouded  and  shrunk  by\r\n\r\njealousy  and  animosity.  The  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeoples  must  come first. This  is  democracy.  I\r\n\r\nsincerely  hope  that  nothing,  no  ideology,  no\r\n\r\npeople,  will stand in the way as this  Government\r\n\r\nstrides  forward to bring peace and prosperity  to\r\n\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the  First Session of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nParliament,   exactly  four   months   after   the\r\n\r\npromulgation  of  Singapore as an independent  and\r\n\r\nsovereign State, the Head of State, His Excellency\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara, remarked that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When we last met in this Chamber, little did we\r\n\r\nforesee that in two years we would meet here again\r\n\r\nas  a  sovereign  Legislature  of  an  independent\r\n\r\nnation, a separate member of the Commonwealth  and\r\n\r\nof the United Nations.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even in this very House, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  atmosphere and the scene have  changed.\r\n\r\nThe  seats in front of us, which were 90 per  cent\r\n\r\nempty after the last general election in 1963, are\r\n\r\nnow  all  completely unoccupied.  And  since  last\r\n\r\nMonday we have missed the sight of eight tiny  men\r\n\r\nin  black trousers and white shirts, shuffling  in\r\n\r\nand   out  of  this  Chamber  shouting  silly  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  insolent  remarks  whenever  Government\r\n\r\nMembers spoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are in no position to predict the\r\n\r\nlength  of  their  absence, there are  indications\r\n\r\nthat  their  boycott will go on at least  for  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  this  Session. It is  hard  for  us  to\r\n\r\nunderstand what sort of people they are  and  what\r\n\r\nthey really want. They talk of democracy, but when\r\n\r\nthey  are  given  the  opportunities  through  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  parliamentary  process  to  air  their\r\n\r\ngrievances  face to face with us, they  prefer  to\r\n\r\nabsent themselves, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshout  morbid  and  empty  slogans  outside   this\r\n\r\nChamber  to  the  effect that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nundemocratic and dictatorial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 9th of August, the Barisan Sosialis has\r\n\r\nlost  much  of its ground support, not because  of\r\n\r\nthe   so-called   undemocratic   and   dictatorial\r\n\r\nattitude of the P.A.P. Government, but because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  puerile  and stupid actions and  utterances\r\n\r\nwhich  are  prejudicial to the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when we were working feverishly for the\r\n\r\nreunification  of  Singapore  and  Malaya  in  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of Malaysia a few years  ago,  they\r\n\r\nworked  in  the opposite direction.  They  branded\r\n\r\nMalaysia  as a neo-colonialist plot. They  opposed\r\n\r\nmerger  to  fight  for  an independent  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIndependence first, followed by merger at a  later\r\n\r\nstage was their formula. And now that Singapore is\r\n\r\nno  longer  part  of Malaysia but  has  become  an\r\n\r\nindependent and sovereign State, they say, \"We  do\r\n\r\nnot  want an independent Singapore because  it  is\r\n\r\nphoney  independence and is a plot of the  British\r\n\r\ncolonialists  and  imperialists  working  hand  in\r\n\r\nglove with their stooges.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody can gainsay that\r\n\r\nSingapore's    independence   is    genuine,    to\r\n\r\nsubstantiate  which  there  is  more  than   ample\r\n\r\ntestimony.  We  were  admitted  into  the   United\r\n\r\nNations  without  any hitch. No African  or  Asian\r\n\r\ncountry opposed our application for membership  of\r\n\r\nthe   Afro-Asian  Conference  which  unfortunately\r\n\r\nfailed  to hold its meeting in Algiers.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  United  Nations  as well  as  the  Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nConference  accepted us with  open  arms.  If  our\r\n\r\nindependence were phoney, as the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nclaimed,  surely  we would have been  rebuffed  by\r\n\r\nthese two bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is further proof of our State's legitimacy.\r\n\r\nAnd  again, Mr Speaker, Sir, our mission  led  by\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister was well received  and\r\n\r\nhighly  honoured  by African, European  and  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries.  The countries they visited represented\r\n\r\nevery  shade  of  ideology from  non-Communist  to\r\n\r\nCommunist   countries.  They  not  only   accepted\r\n\r\nSingapore as an independent and sovereign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState  but  also saw the presence of  the  British\r\n\r\nbase   in  the  correct  perspective.  They   were\r\n\r\nconvinced that the protective base here would  not\r\n\r\nnegate or detract from our independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background we can clearly understand\r\n\r\nthat  at  this  sitting, Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have  absented themselves because  their\r\n\r\nattempts  to  hoodwink the people  on  the  phoney\r\n\r\nindependence  myth  have failed  miserably.  Their\r\n\r\nunfounded allegations that independence has loaded\r\n\r\nSingapore with acute and chaotic economic problems\r\n\r\nfall  on deaf ears. The people of Singapore refuse\r\n\r\nto  listen to such silly and childish remarks  and\r\n\r\nwill  not  allow themselves to follow  a  suicidal\r\n\r\ncourse like that of 1961 when the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\ncreated  economic  paralysis by launching  strikes\r\n\r\nwhich  resulted in the closure of many  factories,\r\n\r\nunemployment among workers and transfer of capital\r\n\r\nacross the Causeway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   Gentlemen  should  have   their   heads\r\n\r\nexamined; after all, they have plenty of free time\r\n\r\nin  which  to  do this, for instead of  fulfilling\r\n\r\ntheir  parliamentary obligations as the Opposition\r\n\r\nhere, they are now on a long holiday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four months after our separation from Malaysia,\r\n\r\nSingapore is still very much alive and is in  fact\r\n\r\neven more viable. As revealed by my colleague  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance in his Budget Speech,  there\r\n\r\nis every indication that Singapore will definitely\r\n\r\nsurvive  and  prosper  in  the  years  ahead.  His\r\n\r\n\"painless\" Budget has been viewed by the people as\r\n\r\nan  index  of  confidence in Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\nfuture.   As  an  encouraging  first  step,   some\r\n\r\noverseas  buyers have already made bulk  purchases\r\n\r\nof  our  locally manufactured plywood, veneer  and\r\n\r\ntextiles.  And now they are engaged  in  exploring\r\n\r\nthe possibilities of introducing a wider range  of\r\n\r\nlocally  manufactured products to the  markets  of\r\n\r\ntheir respective countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trend is that more and more overseas trade\r\n\r\nmissions  will visit Singapore, not only from  the\r\n\r\nnon-Communist countries but also from the European\r\n\r\nCommunist  countries. For example, Yugoslavia  and\r\n\r\nRussia  have  expressed their desire of  relations\r\n\r\nwith us. We encourage relations like these on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbasis  of  mutual  benefit. It is  our  hope  that\r\n\r\neconomic  relations will be the prelude  to  other\r\n\r\nand closer relations. This can be our contribution\r\n\r\nto international goodwill and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not without reasons that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  the  centre of  communications  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  South-East Asia and has  within  the\r\n\r\nlast  150  years developed into the fifth  largest\r\n\r\nport  in  the  world. This is due to  a  quirk  of\r\n\r\ngeography  -  that we are in the centre  of  world\r\n\r\ntrade routes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some people in the neighbouring territory\r\n\r\nrefuse to accept this. To them, Singapore was  and\r\n\r\nstill  is  nothing  more than a small  fish  which\r\n\r\nmakes  a  tasty morsel. But two years of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nmade  them realise that what they mistook for  the\r\n\r\nikan  hilis was really the ikan lepu which,  small\r\n\r\nthough  it be, is protected by a ring of poisonous\r\n\r\nspikes.  So  to  save  their own  skin,  they  had\r\n\r\nperforce to spew out the ikan lepu. For during the\r\n\r\ntwo  years  we  were in Malaysia,  Sir,  we  amply\r\n\r\ndemonstrated ourselves as a people not to be cowed\r\n\r\ninto submission but willing and able to fight  for\r\n\r\nprinciples and inalienable rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We joined Malaysia in the sincere conviction that\r\n\r\nwe  could  play our part in helping  to  create  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial,  equal  and just  society.  We  were\r\n\r\nwilling  to co-operate and offer whatever help  we\r\n\r\ncould in a common endeavour to improve the lot  of\r\n\r\nthe less privileged in the country. We offered the\r\n\r\nservices of our experts to help them to build\r\n\r\nlow-cost  housing for the lower income groups, and  so\r\n\r\non.  But our offers were flatly rejected. Instead,\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian Government went around on the quiet\r\n\r\nto  find  out how we ran our efficient  government\r\n\r\nmachinery,  how  we could build  low-cost  houses,\r\n\r\nschools,  clinics,  hospitals  and  other   social\r\n\r\namenities.  Openly, they expressed their  envy  of\r\n\r\nour  achievements  which  could  have  given  them\r\n\r\ninspiration  to  embark on  similar  projects  but\r\n\r\nwhich  were  only  regarded by them  as  posing  a\r\n\r\nchallenge to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days after the Singapore general elections\r\n\r\nin 1963, U.M.N.O. members in Geylang Serai, led by\r\n\r\ntheir  extremist leaders from Kuala Lumpur,  burnt\r\n\r\nan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neffigy  of  the Prime Minister. This was  to  give\r\n\r\nexpression  to  their  frustration  because  their\r\n\r\ncandidates were rejected by the people and all had\r\n\r\nlost  their  seats.  From  then  on,  the  vicious\r\n\r\npropaganda  that \"the P.A.P. Chinese  Government  is\r\n\r\nsuppressing the Malays\" was echoed with monotonous\r\n\r\nregularity  by  the  U.M.N.O. leaders  in   their\r\n\r\nspeeches and in the Jawi Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a systematic campaign. Social projects\r\n\r\ndesigned to benefit the Malays were distorted.\r\n\r\nLow-cost  flats  aimed at providing  the  Malays  with\r\n\r\nmodern  facilities were decried on the  fictitious\r\n\r\nground that they were not suitable for Malays  who\r\n\r\nprefer to stay only in kampong-type houses.  Malay\r\n\r\nfamilies  were threatened into refusing occupation\r\n\r\nof  these flats, described by the Utusan Melayu as\r\n\r\n\"pigeon holes\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vicious propaganda went on, day in and day\r\n\r\nout.  Their  aim was to impede Singapore's  social\r\n\r\nand  economic headway. Under the influence of  the\r\n\r\nextremists,  the Malays refused  to  move  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir  dilapidated houses to make way  for  modern\r\n\r\nflats. Urban development projects were held up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the campaign to topple the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment, the extremists incited the Malays with\r\n\r\ncommunal slogans of one race, one language and one\r\n\r\nreligion. This culminated in the two riots of July\r\n\r\nand  September  last year. Those  two  race  riots\r\n\r\nwould  not have happened but for the determination\r\n\r\nof  the  extremists and racialists  to  force  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore into accepting Malay rule.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  position was neatly summarised  by  an\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O.  Backbencher when he said at  the  Second\r\n\r\nSession  of the Malaysian Parliament, \"The trouble\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore  is that it is not  accustomed  to\r\n\r\nMalay rule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after our expulsion, the extremists would\r\n\r\nnot leave us alone and blatantly interfered in our\r\n\r\ninternal  affairs  by  exploiting  religious   and\r\n\r\nlanguage issues. Their attempts in the Jawi  Press\r\n\r\nto  create  religious conflict in  Singapore  were\r\n\r\nfoiled before any damage could be done. Then  they\r\n\r\nswitched  over  to  language.  During  our  Second\r\n\r\nNational Language Month concluded recently,  these\r\n\r\nRight-wing  extremists, claiming to be \"the  \r\n\r\nanti-national language leaders\", distributed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliterature   denouncing  Malay  as  the   national\r\n\r\nlanguage  and demanding that Chinese be  made  the\r\n\r\nsole   national  language  of  the  State.   These\r\n\r\npamphlets   written  in  rornanised   Malay   were\r\n\r\npurported to have originated from Chinese language\r\n\r\nchauvinists.  But their game was exposed  and  the\r\n\r\npamphlets  were  traced to be the  work  of  Malay\r\n\r\nextremists, their real intention being  to  create\r\n\r\ncommunal   ill-feeling  between  the  Malays   and\r\n\r\nChinese    which    might   result    in    racial\r\n\r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\necho  the Prime Minister's suggestion that a  more\r\n\r\nrational   relationship  between   the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Singapore Government be  ironed\r\n\r\nout at the conference table. As for the Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I would appeal to them to steer  clear\r\n\r\nof   the  communal  blandishments  of  the   Malay\r\n\r\nextremists.  The real interest of the Malays  lies\r\n\r\nin  co-operating with the other communities  in  a\r\n\r\nconcerted  effort  to achieve economic  viability,\r\n\r\nstep  up the standard of living and create a  more\r\n\r\njust  and  equal national multi-racial society  in\r\n\r\nwhich  every citizen irrespective of racial origin\r\n\r\ncan make the most of the opportunities of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. A. Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. A. Gonzales (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, some four months ago when we were in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  there were people, and I mean  those  in\r\n\r\nthe minority group, who were becoming apprehensive\r\n\r\nabout  their  future in Malaysia and whether  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  swallowed up as a result  of  a  policy\r\n\r\nbeing adopted by certain mad men who unfortunately\r\n\r\nhappened  to  be  our neighbours. The  policy,  if\r\n\r\npursued,  would have spelt disaster not  only  for\r\n\r\nthe  minority group but also for the majority, for\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  way  in  our  multi-racial  society\r\n\r\nwhereby one race can successfully dominate another\r\n\r\nexcept possibly by the use of force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no place for the communalists in this\r\n\r\nsociety of ours. A sigh of relief was heard on the\r\n\r\n9th of August and there was even a certain amount\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  jubilation when we became independent or  when\r\n\r\nindependence   was  thrust  upon   us.   But   the\r\n\r\nhappenings    during    the    months    preceding\r\n\r\nindependence were still fresh in the minds of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  there was still a certain  amount  of\r\n\r\napprehension  as  to what their lot  would  be  in\r\n\r\nindependent Singapore. Unfortunately, we happen to\r\n\r\nhave   the  same  type  of  mad  men  here.   This\r\n\r\napprehension,  I  am  glad to  say,  was  speedily\r\n\r\ndispelled by the statements that the rights of the\r\n\r\nminority  groups would be safeguarded  by  writing\r\n\r\nthem  into the Constitution. I am sure that  there\r\n\r\nis  no  more doubt in the minds of those who doubt\r\n\r\nthe  sincerity  of the Government. Now  that  they\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  rights of our citizens  shall  be\r\n\r\nequal,  not only in law but also in practice,  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  a  tolerant,  multi-racial,   \r\n\r\nmulti-lingual  and multi-religious society is one  which\r\n\r\nwill  take  time, and we must spare no efforts  in\r\n\r\nmaking  this  a  reality in the shortest  possible\r\n\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, heartening to note that those\r\n\r\nwho  exploit  the  situation by appealing  to  the\r\n\r\nracial  and  religious sentiments  of  the  people\r\n\r\nwould  be  dealt with. It is hoped  that  after  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time  and after we have  succeeded  in\r\n\r\nestablishing a tolerant, multi-racial society that\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  in Malaysia will accept the  change,\r\n\r\nand  in  doing  so  pave the way  for  the  coming\r\n\r\ntogether  once  again of the people  who  are,  in\r\n\r\nfact, one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Speech, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara also\r\n\r\ndwelt  on the question of defence, which is by  no\r\n\r\nmeans a light burden that we have to bear now that\r\n\r\nwe  are independent. No self-respecting nation can\r\n\r\nforever  depend on another for protection  against\r\n\r\nits  enemies or even for internal security. We are\r\n\r\nnow  faced with the necessity of raising  an  army\r\n\r\nand  a volunteer force. This will be the acid test\r\n\r\nof the loyalty of the people to this country. This\r\n\r\nis  the time when the traitors show themselves up.\r\n\r\nI  am sure that we will not have to look for loyal\r\n\r\ncitizens  who will make the sacrifice to  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir freedom and self-respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of unemployment is\r\n\r\nanother matter uppermost in our minds and of great\r\n\r\nconcern  to the Government. It has been  estimated\r\n\r\nthat the backlog of unemployment as at the end  of\r\n\r\n1965 is around 55,000, and will increase to 95,000\r\n\r\npersons  within a few years. As we can  no  longer\r\n\r\ndepend  entirely on the entrepot trade, dependence\r\n\r\non  our  industries to provide jobs for those  who\r\n\r\nwill  be  entering  the  labour  market  will   be\r\n\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictive measures that have been\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  restrict the influx  of  unskilled\r\n\r\nworkers  into Singapore to safeguard the interests\r\n\r\nof  our  citizens are, therefore, welcome.  It  is\r\n\r\nheartening to note, however, that the door has not\r\n\r\nbeen  entirely  closed to our  people  across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway  who are skilled workers. I am sure  they\r\n\r\nwill  realise that these steps have been taken  to\r\n\r\nensure our survival and that the responsibility of\r\n\r\nfinding  jobs  for their unemployed rests  on  the\r\n\r\nshoulders of their leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, Mr Speaker, we urge the Government\r\n\r\nto look very closely at the number of jobs created\r\n\r\nby   the  establishment  of  industries.  We   are\r\n\r\ninformed  of  the  number of workers  employed  by\r\n\r\nfirms already in production and of the level  that\r\n\r\nwill  be  reached  when these firms  achieve  full\r\n\r\nproduction. Careful watch must be taken to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  these firms achieve full production  in  the\r\n\r\nshortest possible time and that employment becomes\r\n\r\na  fact and not just a promise. Here, the role  of\r\n\r\nour  trade union leaders and workers becomes  more\r\n\r\nimportant.  Not  only will they have  to  exercise\r\n\r\nmore  restraint in their demands, but they  should\r\n\r\nalso   cooperate  with  management   to   increase\r\n\r\nproduction  and to ensure that their products  are\r\n\r\nof  the  highest quality and of a price comparable\r\n\r\nto  or  even cheaper than the price for  the  same\r\n\r\nproduct produced elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is playing its part in encouraging\r\n\r\ntrade  missions  to visit Singapore.  The  workers\r\n\r\nmust   also   play  their  part  in  raising   the\r\n\r\nproductivity and the standards of the goods they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproduce.  The  more  we produce  for  export,  the\r\n\r\nbetter  our economy, which eventually will  result\r\n\r\nin more jobs being created - jobs for the sons and\r\n\r\ndaughters   of   the  workers  themselves.  \r\n\r\nSelf-interest, at this time when we are faced with  the\r\n\r\ngrave problem of survival, does not pay and  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that  with  wise  leadership  and   the\r\n\r\nindustry  of  the  people,  we  shall  succeed  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  and  even improving our  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving which we shall then be happy to share  with\r\n\r\nour people in Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion to express\r\n\r\nour  thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for  the\r\n\r\nspeech  which he delivered at the opening of  this\r\n\r\nSession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have\r\n\r\nboycotted us this time. They think that  this  act\r\n\r\nmight  create  an  impression  on  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That is their intention of  boycotting\r\n\r\nthe  Parliament.  But the people  are  politically\r\n\r\nsophisticated. They can see through the  intention\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis. The boycott has somewhat\r\n\r\nincreased  our  burden  because  we  now  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider  their point of view in addition  to  our\r\n\r\nown   point   of  view.  Before  any  measure   or\r\n\r\nlegislation can be approved by this House, we have\r\n\r\nto consider the pros and cons from every angle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to general speculation, the reasons for\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan boycott are, firstly, that they  have\r\n\r\nnothing  more worth while to offer to this  House;\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  make any more contributions  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. Secondly, the  Chairman  of\r\n\r\ntheir Party fears that their Members in this House\r\n\r\nmay  not  want to obey his instructions when  they\r\n\r\nspeak,  thus  endangering  his  prestige  and  his\r\n\r\nleadership.  Because his position  has  thus  been\r\n\r\nthreatened,  he  has  ruled  that  these   Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers should not come to this Assembly.  I  will\r\n\r\nnot criticise the Barisan Sosialis any further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, a few points to which I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  draw the attention of the House. Members\r\n\r\nof the House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  elected  by  the voters, and they  should  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  to the people and to speak  on  their\r\n\r\nbehalf.  The boycott of Parliament by the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  has,  in fact, been a  betrayal  of  the\r\n\r\ntrust  of  the  people. They  are  shirking  their\r\n\r\nresponsibility, and they even go a step further by\r\n\r\ndenouncing our independence and saying that it  is\r\n\r\na  phoney  independence. If they do not  recognise\r\n\r\nindependent  Singapore, then I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthem  what  kind  of  people they  are.  Are  they\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore or are they citizens of  any\r\n\r\nother country? If they do not recognise Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen Singapore can also legally denounce them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis in their Party organ has\r\n\r\nalso  denounced the worth and value of  democracy.\r\n\r\nThis  clearly goes to show that they are no longer\r\n\r\ngoing  along  the way of democracy  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir    politics.   They   are   forsaking    the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  democratic  line.  What   is   the\r\n\r\nconclusion expected of this sort of action? It  is\r\n\r\nan  armed and bloody revolution. I would like  all\r\n\r\nthe   people  and  the  Barisan  Sosialis  to  pay\r\n\r\nattention  to what I am going to say. The  Barisan\r\n\r\nare  inspired  by  Jakarta  and  are  directed  by\r\n\r\nPeking.  What are the views of Peking and  Jakarta\r\n\r\non  Singapore?  According to Peking  news,  Peking\r\n\r\nconsiders the Government led by Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew\r\n\r\nas a moderate Leftist Government. This would be an\r\n\r\neye-opener  to  the Barisan Sosialis.  Singapore's\r\n\r\nGovernment  is recognised as a Left-wing  moderate\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying that everything that\r\n\r\ncan  be  achieved in the year must be  planned  in\r\n\r\nspring.   And  everything  pertaining   to   one's\r\n\r\nlivelihood should be planned early in one's  life.\r\n\r\nSo  this  saying  can be applied  to  our  present\r\n\r\nsituation. In other words, in the beginning of the\r\n\r\nyear, in spring, we should plan for the whole year\r\n\r\nand  we should also plan in the early morning  for\r\n\r\nthe  whole  day. In the same way, we  should  also\r\n\r\nhave a long-term plan for the future of Singapore,\r\n\r\njust  like  every individual should have  his  own\r\n\r\nplan  for his life. And the policy speech outlines\r\n\r\nthe  plan for Singapore for the coming year, which\r\n\r\nis a long-term plan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  only for the coming year but also for a  long\r\n\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since 1959, when the P.A.P. came to power,\r\n\r\nit  has been planning for the future and our  plan\r\n\r\nis  many  years ahead. Our achievements have  been\r\n\r\nbeyond  expectations in many fields. And even  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries have recognised this.  But,\r\n\r\non  the  other  hand, there are certain  countries\r\n\r\nwhich  have  to incur a great deficit every  year,\r\n\r\nmillions  of dollars, because of ill-planning  and\r\n\r\nmal-administration. I do not  really  mean  to  be\r\n\r\nunkind to our neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our non-aligned policy, as everybody knows, has\r\n\r\nalready  won us many friends, both from  the  West\r\n\r\nand  also from the East. We have won many  friends\r\n\r\nin  Afro-Asian countries. We have established good\r\n\r\nrelationships with Eastern European countries  and\r\n\r\nalso  with  Russia.  Yugoslavia  and  Russia  have\r\n\r\npromised  to send a delegation to Singapore  early\r\n\r\nnext  year. The Republic of China in the past  two\r\n\r\nyears  did  not buy our rubber but has  now  trade\r\n\r\nrelationships with us. It has bought  some  rubber\r\n\r\nfrom   us.  From  all  sides,  we  are  seeing   a\r\n\r\nfavourable response. They are keenly interested in\r\n\r\nour  friendship. I have reason to believe that  at\r\n\r\nthe  right time, many more will come with  us  and\r\n\r\nthe Republic of China will recognise us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going ahead with our long-term plan.\r\n\r\nSingapore is a small country with an area  of  224\r\n\r\nsquare  miles.  We also have substantial  revenues\r\n\r\nevery  year.  But the expenditure  on  defence  is\r\n\r\nquite  large. We cannot afford to have a big army.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have to build only a small army with\r\n\r\nthe support of a voluntary people's defence corps.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  will have to depend on the support  of\r\n\r\nthe  people. Our people are very conscientious and\r\n\r\nwill  certainly live up to our expectations.  When\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese invaded Malaya, they fought  bravely\r\n\r\nagainst  them.  They are resolute  and  courageous\r\n\r\nenough   to   defend  themselves  for  their   own\r\n\r\nexistence.  The 10,000 volunteers in the  people's\r\n\r\ndefence   corps   can  safely  be   said   to   be\r\n\r\nforthcoming. The people will keenly  take  up  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  to join the army or the volunteers.  In\r\n\r\nspite of the army or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvolunteer force that we may have, it is still  too\r\n\r\nsmall  to defend our country. That is why we  need\r\n\r\nthe  protection  and  help of  our  friends.  That\r\n\r\nexplains   the  presence  of  British   bases   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  bases  in  Cuba,  however,   are\r\n\r\ncontrolled by the United States of America, it  is\r\n\r\nquite  different  from  the  British  bases  here,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are here with the  consent  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment for our own protection. This  has  been\r\n\r\nrecognised  by  the  Afro-Asian  countries   which\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  the existence  of  the  bases  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  does  not infringe on  our  territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity  and  sovereignty. It  is  for  our  own\r\n\r\ndefence  at our own request. The Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  called  on  the  people  not  to  join   the\r\n\r\nvolunteers  or the army. They have also  denounced\r\n\r\nthe  existence  of  the bases. But  if  a  foreign\r\n\r\ncountry tries to invade us, what will they do?  Do\r\n\r\nthey want to hand over Singapore to them? They  do\r\n\r\nnot  even  want to see Singapore exist or survive.\r\n\r\nThey call upon the people not to join the army  or\r\n\r\nthe  volunteer  force.  As everybody  knows,  this\r\n\r\nHouse has allotted $10 million in this respect but\r\n\r\nwe    will   have   trebled   this   amount.   The\r\n\r\nconfrontation  by Indonesia has not caused  losses\r\n\r\nto  us  as expected. It is only $10 million  which\r\n\r\nwas  spent  in social aid for the unemployed.  The\r\n\r\nexistence of Singapore can be safeguarded  through\r\n\r\nGovernment policies and many measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to stress that the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  have to be on the  alert  and  to\r\n\r\ndepend on themselves. That is the basic spirit  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of an independent country.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat we can rely upon ourselves. We should be \r\n\r\nself-reliant and we should be able to stand on our  own\r\n\r\nfeet  for  our survival. Then the people  who  are\r\n\r\ninseparable from us living in Malaysia  will  also\r\n\r\ntry  to  emulate us. As I have said, planning  for\r\n\r\nthe  year  is in spring and the planning  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of Singapore is now. So this is  the  time\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  plan  for  our  future,  and  I  hope\r\n\r\neverybody  will  live up to the duty  expected  of\r\n\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.59 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara has delivered the Speech on\r\n\r\nbehalf   of   the  Government  and  it   is   very\r\n\r\nencouraging to many of us. In it we can  see  very\r\n\r\nclearly  for ourselves that a new nation has  been\r\n\r\nborn  with all sovereignty and integrity.  It  has\r\n\r\nalready  got  all the plans for our  future.  Just\r\n\r\nlike  some  other newly independent  countries  in\r\n\r\nAfro-Asia,  the  people of Singapore  are  now  in\r\n\r\ncontrol  of their own destiny and they can  decide\r\n\r\nthe  future  for themselves. But inevitably,  with\r\n\r\nindependence, we will meet with more  difficulties\r\n\r\nand  responsibilities.  This  is  natural  and  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  this  fact. We are a small  country  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia  and  our destiny  and  fate  are\r\n\r\nclosely  intertwined with the fate and destiny  of\r\n\r\nthe  other  peoples in the same region. Therefore,\r\n\r\nin the course of nation-building, the stability of\r\n\r\nour  country  must  necessarily  depend  upon  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a  multi-racial  society   with\r\n\r\nequality  for  all.  In  the  meantime,   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational field, we must make sure that we are\r\n\r\nnot  isolated.  All  these are factors  that  will\r\n\r\nensure our survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, ever since we achieved independence,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  smoothly  and  without  any  haste\r\n\r\nbecome  the  117th member of the  United  Nations.\r\n\r\nThis  fact is undeniable. Nobody can dispute  that\r\n\r\nat  all. In the field of foreign affairs,  we  are\r\n\r\nadopting a policy of non-alignment and neutrality.\r\n\r\nThat is why we have enhanced our reputation in the\r\n\r\ninternational  arena and we  have  won  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nfriends  and support, both in Afro-Asian countries\r\n\r\nand  in  Eastern European countries.  Lately,  the\r\n\r\nGoodwill   Mission,  led  by  the   Deputy   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,   were  welcomed  wherever  they   went.\r\n\r\nEverywhere they went they were well received  too.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, the anti-nationalist elements in our\r\n\r\nmidst, however, have turned round to say that  the\r\n\r\nindependence  we  have achieved is  phoney.  These\r\n\r\nremarks  are  totally unfounded,  particularly  in\r\n\r\nview  of the fact that we have been admitted  into\r\n\r\nthe  United Nations. This shows that we are  truly\r\n\r\nindependent and that we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  just independent in name. The United  Nations\r\n\r\nis    a    very   well   respected   international\r\n\r\norganisation,  and  it will  not  easily  admit  a\r\n\r\ncountry  as  a member if it has not achieved  true\r\n\r\nindependence.  The remark of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nthat ours is a phoney independence is intended  to\r\n\r\ncreate a wrong impression in the minds of the \r\n\r\nAfro-Asian  countries. But their schemes and  intrigues\r\n\r\nhave  been  exposed. They have  been  broken  into\r\n\r\npieces and this is very encouraging to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other thing we must note. Their\r\n\r\nboycott of the first Session of Parliament may  be\r\n\r\nan  indication  that they have lost confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  system of parliamentary democracy.  This  may\r\n\r\nmark  a  change in their policy; a departure  from\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional struggle in  Parliament  to  a\r\n\r\nstruggle by violence. That is why we must increase\r\n\r\nour  vigilance against whatever move they may make\r\n\r\nor are making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are faced with two great forces\r\n\r\nin  our efforts towards nation-building. The first\r\n\r\nforce, as has been said in the speech by the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara, is the force  of  communalism.\r\n\r\nThe second force is Communism. We can see, and  we\r\n\r\nunderstand very clearly, that the communal  ultras\r\n\r\nhave been and are still shouting the slogan of one\r\n\r\nrace,  one  religion and one language.  They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  doing  this  for the past two  years.  These\r\n\r\nultras   are  trying  to  do  all  they   can   to\r\n\r\nindoctrinate the people of this nation with  their\r\n\r\nideology in order to split the people and break up\r\n\r\nnational unity. At their instigation, some of  our\r\n\r\npeople   have  done  foolish  things  in   certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  But  now the picture  is  entirely\r\n\r\nchanged. Although we can say that they are,  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent, well contained, the people  must,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  be  vigilant  against   the   other\r\n\r\nbroadsides these ultras may deliver at the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to the open front Communist\r\n\r\norganisations. Mr Speaker, ever since we achieved\r\n\r\nindependence,  these open-front organisations  and\r\n\r\nelements have tried to undermine the stability and\r\n\r\nsecurity of our nation. They tried to make Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  issue  in  order  to  create  trouble  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety. So these Left-wing trade unions  and  the\r\n\r\nold  boys' associations, together with a few \r\n\r\npro-Communist  elements  in  the  university   campus,\r\n\r\nattempted to describe the Wang Gung-Wu Report as a\r\n\r\nGovernment  measure intended to anglicise  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. They say that this is the intention of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government. They do so  in  order  to\r\n\r\ncreate  a  feeling of resentment among the  people\r\n\r\nagainst  the Government. Mr Speaker, we  can  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  main point in Professor Wang  Gung-Wu's\r\n\r\nReport is that Nanyang University should have  two\r\n\r\nsystems,  one system for general degrees  and  one\r\n\r\nsystem  for  honours degrees.  This  is  something\r\n\r\nwhich Nanyang University has never had. The second\r\n\r\npoint  in  the  Report is to try to  make  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity a multi-lingual University so  that  it\r\n\r\ncan  be  run  on a sound basis. Some changes  have\r\n\r\nbeen   made  in  the  courses  of  study.  Certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations  have been made  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nturning Nanyang University into a properly run and\r\n\r\nwell  managed  institution of higher  learning  to\r\n\r\nmeet   the   requirements  of  our  society.   The\r\n\r\ngraduates of the University would then be able  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  aspirations of the people with sympathy\r\n\r\nand  understanding. In the new situation now  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  independent,  we require  more  and  more\r\n\r\npeople  with talent to participate in the work  of\r\n\r\nnation-building.  If after some  reforms,  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  is able to turn out more graduates  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the requirements of our society, then it  is\r\n\r\nto be recommended. How can it be said that this is\r\n\r\na move to anglicise Nanyang University? After all,\r\n\r\nwe  have  already decided and agreed that  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity shall remain a University with  Chinese\r\n\r\nas  the medium of instruction. There is no dispute\r\n\r\nover  this  point.  But some of the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nelements   in   Nanyang  University  resorted   to\r\n\r\nvandalism  by writing nonsense on walls  all  over\r\n\r\nthe university campus. They even attempted to burn\r\n\r\ndown the hostel in Nanyang University. They did so\r\n\r\nin  the name of preserving Chinese education. They\r\n\r\nalso  attempted to boycott classes  for  the  same\r\n\r\nreason.  With  the  support of  the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\ntrade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions  and old boys' associations, they go  round\r\n\r\nand  paste slogans and posters at bus shelters and\r\n\r\nsometimes  in the buses themselves. They  want  to\r\n\r\ncreate  an  impression among the people  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is doing harm to Nanyang University  in\r\n\r\nthe  hope that they can whipp ill-feelings against\r\n\r\nthe  Government. But fortunately for us, they have\r\n\r\nnot  been  successful in their attempts.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  people themselves have seen  through\r\n\r\nthe plot and intrigues and the puerile efforts  of\r\n\r\nthese  anti-national elements. The people  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger moved by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these anti-national elements know\r\n\r\nthat  the moment Nanyang University is put on  the\r\n\r\nright  track they will lose a training ground  for\r\n\r\nCommunist  cadres. That is why they are doing  all\r\n\r\nthey  can to stop Nanyang University from  getting\r\n\r\non  to the right track. Thus, they have to pretend\r\n\r\nto  be  the  champions of Nanyang  University  and\r\n\r\nChinese education so that they can do harm instead\r\n\r\nof  good to Nanyang University. If they are really\r\n\r\nsincere   in  their  so-called  love  for  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  then they should not  write  nonsense\r\n\r\nand  slogans on the walls of buildings of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. By so doing, they are in fact  causing\r\n\r\nthe University to spend more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the policy and determination\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. Government to establish  a  \r\n\r\nmulti-racial  nation.  This  is a necessity,  rather  an\r\n\r\nideal,  We  must  of  necessity  look  after   the\r\n\r\ninterest of the minorities in our nation  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will forever become part and parcel  of  the\r\n\r\nentire   nation.  In  fact,  safeguards  for   the\r\n\r\nminority   groups   will  be  written   into   the\r\n\r\nConstitution. This is in line with our  policy  of\r\n\r\nmulti-lingualism  and  multi-racialism.  We   have\r\n\r\nalready got the support of the people. Our  policy\r\n\r\nhas,  in fact, achieved success in this field.  We\r\n\r\nwill  go  a  step  further  by  consolidating  our\r\n\r\nstrength.  This  will give us more  confidence  in\r\n\r\norder  to  achieve even greater success. This,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  will  have  great  repercussions  on  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries where feudalism is  on  the\r\n\r\ndecline. It is inevitable that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  emergence of a multi-racial society will come\r\n\r\nabout.   Generally   speaking,  our   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry does not seem to like the emergence  of  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society. They do not wish to see  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of our multi-racial policy. The  question\r\n\r\nof  the separation of Singapore from Malaysia  was\r\n\r\nbrought  up in the Malaysian Parliament  recently.\r\n\r\nOn  this particular occasion, the racialist ultras\r\n\r\nseemed to be rather unhappy about it. Even some of\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  Ministers shared similar  feelings\r\n\r\nwith  these ultras. Their performance came  as  no\r\n\r\nsurprise to us, because we knew that they did  not\r\n\r\nlike  the emergence of a multi-racial society.  In\r\n\r\ntheir  minds, they had the idea of suppressing  us\r\n\r\nor  even  destroying us. In fact,  they  harboured\r\n\r\nthis  intention. Because of our determination  and\r\n\r\ndecision  to establish a multi-racial society  and\r\n\r\nour  concerted effort to achieve such a  goal,  we\r\n\r\nare still able to survive. We shall strive further\r\n\r\nfor  our  future survival. We must, however,  make\r\n\r\ncertain  calculations  about  these  people.  What\r\n\r\neffect will they have on us if one day they assume\r\n\r\npower  across  the  Causeway? We must,  therefore,\r\n\r\nplan   well  ahead  of  time  and  have  long-term\r\n\r\npolicies against such an eventuality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that our multi-racial society\r\n\r\nwill succeed, we must of necessity set up a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  army  and defence corps, because  we  must\r\n\r\ndepend  on our own strength to protect our society\r\n\r\nand nation. We must have well-trained armed forces\r\n\r\nto  protect our own security and survival. This is\r\n\r\none  of the very basic principles we must have  in\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  delivered in this House on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, certain references have been  made  to\r\n\r\nour  national development. I do not wish  to  make\r\n\r\nany  further repetition, but I would like to bring\r\n\r\nout  a  few highlights on this matter to  give  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  here a better and clearer picture.  It\r\n\r\nis  the policy of the Government to look after the\r\n\r\ninterests of the various races, and this has  been\r\n\r\nstressed over and over again in the past few years\r\n\r\never since we came to power. We want to set up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  multi-racial society. We want to look after the\r\n\r\ninterests of all the people, whether they live  in\r\n\r\nthe city or in the kampong. We do not care whether\r\n\r\nthey  are Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians,  or\r\n\r\nmembers  of  any other race. We give  equality  to\r\n\r\nall.  We  give the same treatment to  all  people,\r\n\r\nirrespective of the colour of their skin or creed.\r\n\r\nThis is the basic policy of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you can go to any kampong in\r\n\r\nSingapore and see there that the livelihood of the\r\n\r\npeople  is  not  very far below  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  enjoyed by the urban people. In  fact,  we\r\n\r\ncan   boast   that  public  amenities  and   other\r\n\r\nfacilities in our kampongs and rural areas are far\r\n\r\nbetter  than some of those provided in  the  urban\r\n\r\nareas of other South-East Asian countries. So  the\r\n\r\nwork that we have done in raising the standard  of\r\n\r\nliving of the rural people, and apart from that of\r\n\r\nthe  city people, has met with great success. This\r\n\r\nsuccess  has been made possible by the  Rural  and\r\n\r\nUrban  Services  Consultative Committee.  We  have\r\n\r\ninstalled  many  standpipes and we  have  provided\r\n\r\nelectricity to a great many kampongs. We have also\r\n\r\nbuilt roads and jetties in some of the surrounding\r\n\r\nislands of Singapore during the period 1960-65. We\r\n\r\nhave spent some $20 million in these projects  and\r\n\r\nwe  have not wasted a single cent or effort.  This\r\n\r\nyear  the  Urban  and Rural Services  Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee  has  spent some $4  million  on  social\r\n\r\namenities,  $2  million  of  which  was  spent  on\r\n\r\nproviding  electricity to some kampongs,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  poor people in the rural areas can also enjoy\r\n\r\nmodern  facilities in our society. This  has  also\r\n\r\nenabled  them to be free from having  to  pay  for\r\n\r\nelectricity  provided by private generators  where\r\n\r\nthe supply is restricted to certain hours only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also provided standpipes in the rural\r\n\r\nareas  so  that the number of people dependent  on\r\n\r\nwell water is decreasing. Less and less people are\r\n\r\ndrawing water from wells and more and more  people\r\n\r\nare  getting their supply of water from the  taps.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is the policy of the Government to try\r\n\r\nto  provide every home in the rural area  with  at\r\n\r\nleast a water tap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have built some 52 miles of roads in the\r\n\r\nkampong areas at a very high cost. The efforts  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government are well appreciated  by  all  the\r\n\r\npeople  in the 51 constituencies, including  those\r\n\r\nrepresented by the Barisan Sosialis. In  fact,  we\r\n\r\ndo  not regard the constituents represented by the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis as outcasts. We are paying  just\r\n\r\nas   much  attention  to  them  as  to  the  other\r\n\r\nconstituents. It is a matter for regret  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis are not here to speak on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  the people they represent. At any rate,  as  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  Government, we will  do  all  we  can\r\n\r\nthrough  the Urban and Rural Services Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee to provide modern facilities to all  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can give a few examples. In 1965 in the Choa\r\n\r\nChu Kang constituency which was represented by the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, we spent some $290,000  on  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of roads. In Bukit Panjang, we  spent\r\n\r\nsome   $310,000  for  the  purposes  of  providing\r\n\r\nelectricity and water. In Nee Soon, we spent about\r\n\r\n$260,000  for similar purposes. Mr Speaker,  from\r\n\r\nall  these figures and facts, you can see how much\r\n\r\nattention the Government is paying to these  rural\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can now understand the Barisan Sosialis for\r\n\r\nboycotting  us because they are unable  to  refute\r\n\r\nthese  facts. Apart from shouting slogans in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, they are also drawing $500 allowance  each.\r\n\r\nThey are actually wasting public funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the intention and aim of the\r\n\r\nGovernment in its second Five-Year Plan to provide\r\n\r\nsome 60,000 housing units, mainly in Toa Payoh. We\r\n\r\nare    also    going   ahead   with   our    urban\r\n\r\nreconstruction. Some people have been affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  resettlement scheme. Since 1st January, 1964,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  has  provided   new   rates   of\r\n\r\ncompensation. These new rates have made  our  work\r\n\r\nof  resettlement  very much easier.  Those  people\r\n\r\naffected by this scheme are in every respect given\r\n\r\nassistance  in securing alternative accommodation.\r\n\r\nIn  our  reclamation scheme we also  provide  much\r\n\r\nassistance to those affected so as to reduce their\r\n\r\nhardships, or whatever their difficulties, to  the\r\n\r\nvery minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy is enlightened. That is\r\n\r\nwhy the pro-Communist anti-nationals have not been\r\n\r\nable   to  instigate  the  people  who  have  been\r\n\r\naffected  by  these  schemes  to  go  against  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  So in order to look after  their  own\r\n\r\ninterests  and  their  welfare,  the  people  must\r\n\r\nincrease  their vigilance. In fact, the Government\r\n\r\nhave  learnt a great deal over the past few years,\r\n\r\nand   they  now  realise  the  importance  of \r\n\r\nco-operating  with the people; and in return  we  too\r\n\r\nrespect them very much. This again shows that  the\r\n\r\npeople  and the Government are now almost  one  in\r\n\r\nthe  intention  and common effort to  establish  a\r\n\r\nbetter nation in which to live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements in housing of the Government\r\n\r\nover  the past five years have been great  because\r\n\r\nof our able leadership. Our fame has spread abroad\r\n\r\nand  has  been recognised in Mr Lim Kim San,  the\r\n\r\nformer  Minister  for National Development,  being\r\n\r\nawarded   the   Magsaysay  prize.   This   is   an\r\n\r\nencouragement to us and we shall continue to  work\r\n\r\nharder  for the interests of the people by  trying\r\n\r\nto raise their standard of living both in the city\r\n\r\nand in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now going through the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  give all forms  of  assistance  to\r\n\r\nfarmers.  We  have well-trained personnel  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  set  up  veterinary and  other  stations  to\r\n\r\nassist the farmers in increasing their production.\r\n\r\nThe total production of the rural areas amounts to\r\n\r\nsome  $200  million per year. We are now  able  to\r\n\r\nproduce eggs not only for our own consumption  but\r\n\r\nalso  for export. Only recently, in September this\r\n\r\nyear, the Government held an agricultural show  to\r\n\r\nlet   the   world   and  our  people   know   what\r\n\r\nachievements  we  have made  in  the  rural  areas\r\n\r\nthrough the Ministry of National Development. Some\r\n\r\n300,000  people visited the show. This is a  clear\r\n\r\nindication that great care has been taken  of  the\r\n\r\nrural   people,  particularly  those  engaged   in\r\n\r\nfarming.  We  have  also met with  recognition  in\r\n\r\nrespect of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech\r\n\r\ndelivered at the opening of this Session is a\r\n\r\nhistorical one. I consider myself privileged to\r\n\r\nexpress my views on this Motion of Thanks for his\r\n\r\nSpeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore became independent at a rather\r\n\r\nunexpected  moment.  Several benefits  are  to  be\r\n\r\nderived  from  this.  Many of  our  problems  were\r\n\r\nsolved when our Goodwill Mission went to Afro-Asia\r\n\r\nunder the leadership of the Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe  question of bases in Singapore was  explained\r\n\r\nby  this Mission to friendly nations of Afro-Asia.\r\n\r\nThis has met with great success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there are many problems to be\r\n\r\ndealt  with  in connection with our  survival.  We\r\n\r\nneed  trade as well as industrial growth.  Several\r\n\r\nplans  have been announced to increase  our  trade\r\n\r\nand  industry. We are now assured of our  national\r\n\r\nsurvival.   Our   people  must  also   have   some\r\n\r\nassurance,  for only then will we be able  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir full co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1959 when the People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  came to power, we  have  seen  many\r\n\r\nchanges  and  even tribulations. We  have  derived\r\n\r\nmany lessons from this and our people are enjoying\r\n\r\na high standard of living in South-East Asia. Even\r\n\r\nfamilies of lower income group are today  able  to\r\n\r\nhave television sets in their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members who spoke before me in this Chamber\r\n\r\nhave  praised the health service of Singapore.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, I do not disagree with them. In fact, even\r\n\r\nour   political  enemies  are  given   first-class\r\n\r\nmedical treatment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are one or two things that I would\r\n\r\nlike  to point out. We may recall that there  were\r\n\r\nsome regulations for controlling cattle. But I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think they have been carried out effectively,\r\n\r\nand  I  do hope that something will be done in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, primary education is entirely\r\n\r\nfree  in  Singapore. This is of tremendous benefit\r\n\r\nto poor families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  sometimes children of poor families  have  to\r\n\r\ntravel  great  distances  to  their  homes.  Their\r\n\r\nparents  have  to  incur quite heavy  expenditure.\r\n\r\nSuch  families, therefore, do not derive the  full\r\n\r\nbenefit from primary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to say something about\r\n\r\nthe   special   services  of   the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board in which I serve. In  the  first\r\n\r\nFive-Year Plan, 51,000 houses have been built  and\r\n\r\nin  the  second Five-Year Plan, some 60,000 houses\r\n\r\nwill  be  built; but I do wish to  bring  to  your\r\n\r\nattention  some  of  the  shortcomings   of   this\r\n\r\ndepartment. Because housing development  has  been\r\n\r\nprogressing at such a rate, some traffic  problems\r\n\r\nhave  been created. I do hope that these problems,\r\n\r\nwhich  have  arisen as a result of  multi-storeyed\r\n\r\nfiat  construction,  will  be  solved.  More   car\r\n\r\nparking spaces and more playing fields have to  be\r\n\r\nconstructed.  The Housing Board must  improve  its\r\n\r\nservices  to  the people with the co-operation  of\r\n\r\nother  Ministries. For instance, the provision  of\r\n\r\npublic   telephones  has  to  be  increased.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health could provide more and  bigger\r\n\r\nmarkets  in the housing estates, because  many  of\r\n\r\nthe  present markets are rather small. It has been\r\n\r\nannounced that the new Television Studio  will  be\r\n\r\nready  by  about the middle of next year.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthere will be school television broadcasts. I wish\r\n\r\nto know whether and when school broadcasts will be\r\n\r\nintroduced, and whether the Tamil programmes  will\r\n\r\nbe further improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to say something on the public notice\r\n\r\nboards.  Many spelling and grammatical  errors  in\r\n\r\nthe Tamil language are found in these notices. The\r\n\r\nTamil  language has received official  status,  so\r\n\r\nthis  misspelling in the notices  is  not  a  good\r\n\r\nthing.  I do hope that something will be  done  to\r\n\r\nrectify it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we now turn to the boycott of this Assembly\r\n\r\nby  the  Barisan  Sosialis?  As  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,    there    are    many    duties    and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  we  have  to  discharge  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  During  an  earlier  phase,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   felt  there  should  be  more  Assembly\r\n\r\nsittings.  Assembly sittings appeared  urgent  and\r\n\r\nnecessary to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  have  already  spoken earlier about  this.  Now\r\n\r\nbecause of urgent Government business, we have met\r\n\r\nagain  in  this Assembly. But we do not  see  them\r\n\r\nhere today. They have boycotted this Session.  But\r\n\r\nthe  people did not elect them so that they should\r\n\r\nboycott  their Legislative Assembly. Moreover,  we\r\n\r\nnow  know  there  is  a split  among  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  But  this  is entirely  their  concern.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it is unforgivable that  they\r\n\r\nshould have failed to turn up at this Assembly. As\r\n\r\nMembers,  they are receiving $500 allowance  each;\r\n\r\nbut  if  they  had asked the Assembly to  withhold\r\n\r\nthis payment, then they would be worthy of praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to thank the Prime Minister for\r\n\r\nhaving  given  us  the  opportunity  during   this\r\n\r\nSession not only to praise the Government, but  to\r\n\r\ncriticise where necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, twice in the past\r\n\r\ntwenty  years  has Singapore been  separated  from\r\n\r\nMalaya.   On  both  occasions,  they   have   been\r\n\r\nartificial separations, and on both occasions, for\r\n\r\nillogical  reasons  which some outside  power  had\r\n\r\nforced on the people of both territories, with one\r\n\r\npossible exception. In 1945, the British separated\r\n\r\nSingapore  to retain its hold on the island  as  a\r\n\r\nstrategic  military base in the days when  Britain\r\n\r\ncould  no  longer hold on to India, Burma,  Ceylon\r\n\r\nand  Pakistan, and her other colonial  possessions\r\n\r\nin  the  East  were  becoming untenable.  In  1965\r\n\r\nSingapore was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseparated  after two years of merger  because  the\r\n\r\nCentral    Malaysian   Government    found    that\r\n\r\npolitically Singapore within Malaysia was a threat\r\n\r\nand  a  danger to her political position in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.   The   people   of  Malaysia,   including\r\n\r\nSingapore, were told in August this year  that  we\r\n\r\nhad  to  he  evicted  because of  imminent  racial\r\n\r\nstrife. The official reason given was that it  was\r\n\r\na  choice  between separation or  repression,  and\r\n\r\nthat if Singapore remained in Malaysia and neither\r\n\r\ncourse of action was taken, then there would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a blood-bath all over the country. Here,  it\r\n\r\nmight  not he altogether futile for us to dwell  a\r\n\r\nlittle on the subject of separation, although  now\r\n\r\nthat we are a distinct and independent nation,  so\r\n\r\nsuddenly  thrust upon us, it would fall  upon  the\r\n\r\nhistorian  to write about the second severance  of\r\n\r\nSingapore from mainland Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the British in their three odd centuries of\r\n\r\ncolonialism all over the world have the  knack  of\r\n\r\nleaving  behind  problems of  their  own  creation\r\n\r\nwhich,  even  after  they have  been  thrown  out,\r\n\r\nproved in many cases to be problems which are  not\r\n\r\neasy   of  solution.  Whether  it  is  in   India,\r\n\r\nPakistan,  or Palestine, or Burma, Ceylon.  Cyprus\r\n\r\nor   Malaysia,   the  policy  of   divide-and-rule\r\n\r\nperpetrated by British colonialism has left in its\r\n\r\nwake   serious  political,  economic  and   social\r\n\r\nproblems  which, long after they  have  gone,  the\r\n\r\npeople of these countries are saddled with through\r\n\r\nno  fault  of their own, except for the fact  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  the misfortune of being  subjected  to\r\n\r\nBritish colonialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, it is no use crying over spilt milk,\r\n\r\nalthough  we know that quite often the ex-colonial\r\n\r\npower makes pious pretensions of desiring to solve\r\n\r\nproblems  of  their  own  making.  The  industrial\r\n\r\nrevolution in Europe leading to the acquisition of\r\n\r\ncolonies in Asia, Africa and South America  belong\r\n\r\nto  one era in the history of the world, and  that\r\n\r\nera  will  not repeat itself. Hence  there  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion  of avoiding a second time what  colonial\r\n\r\npowers  have  once committed. For  better  or  for\r\n\r\nworse  we  have  to face and solve these  problems\r\n\r\nourselves. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolonial  powers in most cases have the  habit  of\r\n\r\nleaving  behind  not  only  economic  and   social\r\n\r\nproblems  hut also political inheritors  of  their\r\n\r\nilk who quite often have an interest in wanting to\r\n\r\nperpetuate  the  economic  and  social   hierarchy\r\n\r\nbequeathed by them. Seen in this light the  events\r\n\r\nof  the last few years in Singapore, Malaya. Sabah\r\n\r\nand   Sarawak   are  not  at  all   difficult   to\r\n\r\nunderstand.  Was it racial strife and  a  communal\r\n\r\nblood-bath that those in Kuala Lumpur were  trying\r\n\r\nto  avoid?  Or was it the gradual erosion  of  the\r\n\r\nestablished economic and social system  which  the\r\n\r\npowers  that-be  in Kuala Lumpur in  the  Alliance\r\n\r\nGovernment were trying to halt and postpone?  Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  clear to the people not only in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia but to all who believe in  progress,\r\n\r\nhuman   dignity,   equality  and   justice,   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  evicted to postpone  the  eventual\r\n\r\nvictory  of social forces inspired by the ideology\r\n\r\nof  democratic  socialism from spreading  far  and\r\n\r\nwide  into the towns and kampongs, from Tebrau  to\r\n\r\nPadang Besar and Tawau to Kuching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, recently I had occasion to ask\r\n\r\na  visiting  Member of Parliament from a  friendly\r\n\r\ncountry,  who  had earlier visited  Kuala  Lumpur,\r\n\r\nwhat  he  was  told of the reason for  Singapore's\r\n\r\neviction  from Malaysia. He told me that officials\r\n\r\nin   Kuala  Lumpur  had  told  him  that   because\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  predominantly  Chinese,  and   the\r\n\r\nChinese  were  dominating  the  economy   of   the\r\n\r\ncountry, therefore the solution was to get rid  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Sir,  I  believe   this   Member   of\r\n\r\nParliament  I am quoting was himself quoting  from\r\n\r\nnot  only officials but Ministers. I remember very\r\n\r\nwell  the  Tunku, in justifying his call  for  the\r\n\r\nformation  of  Malaysia in  1961,  said  that  the\r\n\r\nreason Sabah and Sarawak should be taken into  the\r\n\r\nnew  Federation was to balance up the  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore with the indigenous  people\r\n\r\nin  the  Borneo States whom the Tunku then thought\r\n\r\nwere also Malays. There are in Singapore about 1.3\r\n\r\nmillion Chinese and almost four million in Malaya,\r\n\r\napart from those in Sabah and Sarawak. The problem\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese is, therefore, not one  which  is\r\n\r\npeculiar to Singapore. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  not  even one which those in power in Malaysia\r\n\r\nhave  to  face  alone. Indeed all over  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia, in Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, and  to  a\r\n\r\nlesser  extent in the Philippines, the governments\r\n\r\nin  these  countries  face  the  same  problem  of\r\n\r\nimmigrant  Chinese who had settled and made  their\r\n\r\nhomes in these countries. The question is, how  is\r\n\r\nthis  problem  of the Chinese to  be  solved?  Are\r\n\r\nthere  any  lessons  we can learn  from  Thailand,\r\n\r\nCambodia   and  Vietnam  about  the   problem   of\r\n\r\nintegration?  Is  political, cultural  and  social\r\n\r\nintegration  possible  over  a  long   period   of\r\n\r\npolitical   stability,  for   example?   Or   must\r\n\r\nsegregation be the only solution of the Chinese in\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore? Conversely, is it possible\r\n\r\nto solve the problem of Chinese presence by racial\r\n\r\ndomination in politics? Or has the solution to  be\r\n\r\nbrought  about by a get-together of the people  of\r\n\r\nMalay   race  in  Malaysia,  Indonesia   and   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines to outnumber and later to squeeze  out\r\n\r\nthe Chinese from these areas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these propositions have direct relevance to\r\n\r\nthe  Speech by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara when  he\r\n\r\nsaid that \"we may be two countries but we are  one\r\n\r\npeople.\"   Not  a  few  people  in   our   closest\r\n\r\nneighbouring country believe that this is also the\r\n\r\ncase.  It  is hard to believe that our  neighbours\r\n\r\nthink it possible really to isolate Singapore on a\r\n\r\nracial  basis,  because I think  they  would  have\r\n\r\nfound  the same problem reverberating within their\r\n\r\nown territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have lived many years of my life in\r\n\r\nMalaya, and in those years, I have posed to myself\r\n\r\nand  to  others this same question. I  have  found\r\n\r\nthat  not only has this problem remained the  same\r\n\r\nafter all these years, but that I have been unable\r\n\r\nto  get new answers to this problem of the Chinese\r\n\r\nin this part of the world. As a matter of fact, as\r\n\r\nthe  years pass and my hair grows grey, I am  more\r\n\r\narid more convinced that the only solution is  for\r\n\r\nus  of  all races to live together peacefully  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the  foundations of the  multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-cultural and multi-religious  society.  Even\r\n\r\ntoday  I am prepared to consider and rethink about\r\n\r\nany  other  solution, if there is one  forthcoming\r\n\r\nfrom  any quarter. Upon separation, when the Tunku\r\n\r\noffered the Malays\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  ten  acres each in  Johore,  I  was\r\n\r\nwondering  whether he was taking the  second  step\r\n\r\ntowards  what  he  thought was  going  to  be  the\r\n\r\ncomplete   isolation  of  Singapore.  I   wondered\r\n\r\nwhether  he wanted all the Malays in Singapore  to\r\n\r\nleave  this fair island and go back to Malaya  and\r\n\r\nthereby encourage the four million odd Chinese  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia and possibly millions more all over \r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia to make Singapore a Chinese city. I  do\r\n\r\nnot know what his intentions were. But it is clear\r\n\r\nthat   the  absence  of  any  response  from   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Malays is more than an  answer  to  the\r\n\r\nTunku's  call. It seems to me that even  if  there\r\n\r\nare  unthinking Malays elsewhere in  Malaysia  who\r\n\r\nare  thinking along the same line, then they  will\r\n\r\nsimilarly  learn that the Malays in  Singapore  do\r\n\r\nnot  propose to leave our shores even if they were\r\n\r\noffered ten times ten acres. It would indeed be  a\r\n\r\ntragedy  for  the  Malays if  we  helped  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore a Chinese city. He must be a mad man  to\r\n\r\nhelp  in  the creation of a second Israel in  this\r\n\r\nworld. It goes against the grain of any sane Malay\r\n\r\nto  leave  Singapore, an island which is part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of  the  Malay  world,  for  purely  party\r\n\r\npolitical reasons to satisfy the selfish political\r\n\r\nambitions of certain people. Singapore  is  to  us\r\n\r\nour world, as much as Malaya is to those living in\r\n\r\nthat  part  of the world. You can ask a Malay  who\r\n\r\nhas, for example, settled in Bangkok to return  to\r\n\r\nhis  country of origin for these reasons. But  can\r\n\r\nyou  ask us to leave Singapore to fit in with  the\r\n\r\npolitical  strategy  of the Alliance?  And  if  we\r\n\r\nleave Singapore, where do we go?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of land and ownership of land,\r\n\r\nSingapore Malays, and for that matter Singaporeans\r\n\r\nof   all   races,  have  very  little   in   their\r\n\r\npossession. But in terms of earning capacity we in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  Malays  included,  earn  on   the\r\n\r\naverage  two,  three or four times more  than  the\r\n\r\npadi  farmers  or  fishermen in Malaya  and  other\r\n\r\nparts of Malaysia. When we were still in Malaysia,\r\n\r\nI  had  occasion  to  look  into  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nresettlement  in land development schemes  carried\r\n\r\nout  in  at least two areas in Malaysia, including\r\n\r\nthe  one at Sungei Buloh. What I saw there  leaves\r\n\r\nmuch to be desired. On the other hand, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalays  in Singapore, who have been used to modern\r\n\r\nand  advanced  social amenities and services  made\r\n\r\nreadily  available  and accessible  to  increasing\r\n\r\nnumbers  of people in the lower income group,  are\r\n\r\nnot  at all likely to leave their homes which  are\r\n\r\nin  many cases subsidised by the Government. I  am\r\n\r\npretty  certain that they will not go to the  less\r\n\r\nhabitable  and  undeveloped  areas  in  Johore  or\r\n\r\nPahang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, more than this Singapore Malays\r\n\r\nhave  come to love the open society and the nature\r\n\r\nof   equality,  freedom,  justice,  democracy  and\r\n\r\nprogress,  the five principles symbolised  in  the\r\n\r\nstars in our flag. The Malays in Singapore are not\r\n\r\nused  to be treated as Harijans by local Brahmins.\r\n\r\nSir, we in Singapore, all of us - Malays, Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndians,  Ceylonese,  like  you,  Sir,  Eurasians,\r\n\r\nPakistanis  and others - have strong  and  healthy\r\n\r\nred blood in our veins. In Singapore our inquiring\r\n\r\nminds want to know whether there are really people\r\n\r\nwith  white blood, as a Malay idiom describes  it.\r\n\r\nFor  hundreds of years we have heard about the\r\n\r\nso-called   blue-blooded   chieftains   who   enjoyed\r\n\r\nprivileges and comforts for doing nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if you are aware of a fundamental\r\n\r\nteaching  in  Islam which prohibits its  followers\r\n\r\nfrom  cringing  or  in any way  worshipping  human\r\n\r\nbeings whatever the colour of their blood. Muslims\r\n\r\nare not supposed to sembah to anyone except Allah.\r\n\r\nThe term to describe prayer in Islam, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nis  Sembah  Yang. In its fuller form it is  Sembah\r\n\r\nYang  Maha Kuasa dan Maha Esa. Muslims only sembah\r\n\r\nto God and to no one else, and we believe in this.\r\n\r\nWe  are an independent and sovereign State in  the\r\n\r\ncomity   of   nations.  A  hundred   and   sixteen\r\n\r\nindependent   and  sovereign  States   and   their\r\n\r\ngovernments  have  accepted  us  into  the  United\r\n\r\nNations Organisation. More than a billion  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  are with us in the international family  of\r\n\r\nindependent and sovereign nations. Yet there are a\r\n\r\nfew  miserable characters in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwho  say that our independence is phoney. They  do\r\n\r\nnot  recognise  Singapore's  independence.  In   a\r\n\r\nstatement in reply to a challenge to them  to  ask\r\n\r\nfor a public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninquiry  regarding  Lim Chin  Siong,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis asked for air radio and T.V. time on  our\r\n\r\nmass  medium. What is the true position? The  true\r\n\r\nposition  is  that  on  two  occasions  when   the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the Barisan Sosialis, Dr  Lee  Siew\r\n\r\nChoh, was invited to take part in T.V. forums,  he\r\n\r\nrefused  to attend them. He was running away  from\r\n\r\nthe  open argument. I am told that they want radio\r\n\r\nand  T.V. time to themselves so that they can make\r\n\r\nspeeches  without  having  to  take  part   in   a\r\n\r\ndiscussion. Sir, they can have this; they can have\r\n\r\nwhat  they  ask, but on condition that they  first\r\n\r\nwin  a  general  election in Singapore.  Then,  as\r\n\r\nmembers of the Government, they can appear on T.V.\r\n\r\nand  radio to explain Government policy and  other\r\n\r\nrelated matters. The people in Singapore look upon\r\n\r\nthem  as being no more than political opportunists\r\n\r\nwho  have  time  and again lost out  in  free  and\r\n\r\ndemocratic  elections,  open  arguments,  in   the\r\n\r\nReferendum  and even in international forums.  You\r\n\r\nremember,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that  Dr  Lee  Siew\r\n\r\nChoh, Woodhull, Dr Lim Hock Siew and others  went\r\n\r\nto  the  United Nations to fight against  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand the Referendum. In the December, 1965 issue of\r\n\r\nthe Plebeian Express, the Barisan Sosialis alleged\r\n\r\nthat    the    Afro-Asian   People's    Solidarity\r\n\r\nOrganisation had snubbed the P.A.P., the governing\r\n\r\nParty  in  Singapore, it seems. It is a fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  Permanent Secretariat of the A.A.P.S.O. works\r\n\r\non the principle of unanimity, among other things,\r\n\r\non the question of membership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Permanent Secretariat, besides members\r\n\r\nfrom the U.A.R. and other non-Communist Asian  and\r\n\r\nAfrican  countries, are also to be  found  members\r\n\r\nfrom Peking, the Japanese Communist Party and  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Communist Party, the leaders  of  whom,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  are today running  for  their\r\n\r\nlives looking for hide-outs. It is, therefore, not\r\n\r\nat  all surprising that opposition by any or  some\r\n\r\nof   these   Communist  representatives   on   the\r\n\r\nPermanent   Secretariat  of  the  A.A.P.S.O. can\r\n\r\nprevent  unanimity, and this is what has  happened\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of not only Singapore's membership,\r\n\r\nbut  the  membership of other applicants as  well.\r\n\r\nMembership of the A.A.P.S.O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  on  an unofficial basis, unlike the Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nConference  where  Heads of  State  and  Heads  of\r\n\r\nGovernment attend. Membership of the A.A.P.S.O. is\r\n\r\nlimited to organisations which may or may  not  be\r\n\r\nin  the  governments of Afro-Asian countries.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  Japan  is represented on  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretariat  of the A.A.P.S.O. by members  of  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Communist Party, but not by  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Editor of the Barisan Sosialis is talking\r\n\r\nthrough  his hat when he talks about the governing\r\n\r\nParty in Singapore being snubbed by non-government\r\n\r\npro-Communist members of the Permanent Secretariat\r\n\r\nof  the  A.A.P.S.O. What matters is  the  official\r\n\r\nrecognition by Governments in Asia and Africa  and\r\n\r\nin the world at large as represented in the United\r\n\r\nNations Organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these hard facts the boycott of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis of this  Chamber  does  not\r\n\r\nconstitute  even a ripple in the ocean of  support\r\n\r\nand  expressed friendship and understanding  shown\r\n\r\nto  Singapore by accredited Governments and Asians\r\n\r\nof  the world. Dr Lee Siew Choh and his gang  are\r\n\r\nnot  going to make any difference to our  position\r\n\r\nas an independent and sovereign State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am inclined to think that not only Lim\r\n\r\nChin  Siong  should be examined by  psychiatrists,\r\n\r\nbut  there  are many more in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwho  would  appear  to  be  in  greater  need   of\r\n\r\npsychiatric treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of education, the planned programme\r\n\r\nof expansion in Primary and Secondary Schools, the\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Training College and other institutions\r\n\r\nof   high   learning,  speaks   for   itself.   If\r\n\r\nSingapore's  independence is phoney,  if  all  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment plans, including those in the field of\r\n\r\neducation, are phoney and of no consequence,  then\r\n\r\nleaders in the Barisan Sosialis, married and  with\r\n\r\nchildren, like Dr Lee Siew Choh, should  withdraw\r\n\r\nall their children in our schools in Singapore and\r\n\r\nsend  them for higher learning to Peking, if  they\r\n\r\nwant  to.  In  Indonesia, there  is  an  institute\r\n\r\ncalled  the Lenin Institute in Sourabaya, and  Dr\r\n\r\nLee  Siew  Choh can send his grown-up children  or\r\n\r\neven the younger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nones  to that Institute. But, of course, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  professors and lecturers in  the  Lenin\r\n\r\nInstitute are also running for their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, Mr Speaker, Sir, have lost\r\n\r\nhope  in the democratic processes, and it is  only\r\n\r\nwhen  politicians have given up all hope  of  ever\r\n\r\nwinning in an election, in a referendum and in  an\r\n\r\nopen  argument,  that they turn to more  desperate\r\n\r\nways;   and,   when   they   do,   some   of   the\r\n\r\nmanifestations take the form of boycott of elected\r\n\r\nLegislatures like ours for no logical and rational\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was reading a short letter in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  the  other  day from a writer  in  Petaling\r\n\r\nJaya, which happens to be part of the constituency\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Bungsar - but that has nothing\r\n\r\nto  do  with the letter. But the writer has  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not Barisan Sosialis Members  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Parliament should  also  boycott  their\r\n\r\n$500  a month allowance. I think, Sir, before this\r\n\r\nParliamentary Session is over, it would be good if\r\n\r\nyou could make a ruling on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence, we were travelling in some parts  of\r\n\r\nAfrica,  Europe - Eastern Europe -  and  Asia,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, and what struck me most  about  the\r\n\r\nreception  given to us was that it  was  not  only\r\n\r\nwarm  everywhere we went but that the people  were\r\n\r\ninterested to know why Singapore left Malaysia. In\r\n\r\nnot  a  few cases, leaders of governments, leaders\r\n\r\nof the Opposition, some of whom are pro-Communists\r\n\r\nlike Dr Lee Siew Choh and others here, shook  our\r\n\r\nhands  warmly and congratulated us on having  left\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Words like \"liberation\" were mentioned,\r\n\r\nas  the Minister for Health has just said. But one\r\n\r\nother  thing which sometimes gladdened our  hearts\r\n\r\nwas  that  some of them said, \"You have done  very\r\n\r\nwell  by  having  left the-Kuala  Lumpur  type  of\r\n\r\npoliticians,\" and all the rest of it which went to\r\n\r\ndescribe people who go cringing about before \r\n\r\nblue-blooded chieftains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this allegation of our independence being\r\n\r\nphoney,  I  do not know what measure  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   leaders   use   when   they   talk   of\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether  a  country which has a  foreign  military\r\n\r\nbase,  when  it achieves independence  is  phoney;\r\n\r\nwhether countries like the Philippines, which  has\r\n\r\na  relatively  large American  military  base,  is\r\n\r\nphoney;  whether Ceylon, which upon attainment  of\r\n\r\nindependence   in  1947  also  had   a   base   in\r\n\r\nTrincomalee  was  phoney in its  independence;  or\r\n\r\nwhether Thailand with its S.E.A.T.O. base is  also\r\n\r\nphoney.

They all know about\r\n\r\nit. There are very few leaders in the world who do\r\n\r\nnot  know  that  there  is  a  military  base   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But we explained to them very  clearly\r\n\r\nand  forthrightly that there is nothing wrong with\r\n\r\nhaving  a  base  in Singapore, and that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing wrong in having an air base - and a  naval\r\n\r\nbase   at  that  -  within  the  confines  of   an\r\n\r\nindependent and sovereign nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not one government leader in any of the\r\n\r\ncountries  we  visited questioned the  independent\r\n\r\nand  sovereign status we have in Singapore  today.\r\n\r\nSo   who  are  those  characters  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  to question us? What do they want?  Must\r\n\r\nSingapore  fall  into the hands of the  Communists\r\n\r\nand  then only become independent?

One can almost see the  glint  of\r\n\r\ninsanity in their eyes when they talk along  these\r\n\r\nlines,  because  I  am  sure  you  yourself,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  asked this question and not found the answer\r\n\r\nas  to  why  they say Singapore's independence  is\r\n\r\nphoney.  We  can go on considering this  question,\r\n\r\nprobably  only  to arrive at one  conclusion,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is,  that  the Barisan Sosialis  are  phoney\r\n\r\nsocialists.  One is sometimes tempted to  describe\r\n\r\nthem as Communists or pro-Communists, but even the\r\n\r\nCommunists we met in Russia were not phoney.  They\r\n\r\nwere  genuine Communists. But here we have Members\r\n\r\nof Parliament who earn $500 a month as \r\n\r\nallowance - not 500 Indonesian rupiahs, but 500 real Singapore\r\n\r\ndollars,  Straits dollars - and yet  they  boycott\r\n\r\neverything except what they pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I rise to speak in support  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion  standing in the name of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nexpressing  our  thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara for his Speech on the 8th of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is the first sitting of Parliament after\r\n\r\nSingapore's independence four months  ago,  it  is\r\n\r\nworthwhile recalling that Singapore is unique, not\r\n\r\nonly  in  the  manner as expressed  by  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  that independence was achieved  without\r\n\r\nbloodshed, and with a large foreign military  base\r\n\r\nstill  intact,  but that in recorded  history,  no\r\n\r\ncountry has ever proclaimed its independence three\r\n\r\ntimes like Singapore! It shows how much the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore love independence, but they also love\r\n\r\npeace  -  not  violence or  bloodshed  - even\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first declaration of independence was made on\r\n\r\nthe  31st  of  August,  1963,  as  agreed  by  the\r\n\r\nsignatories  to the Malaysia Agreement  signed  in\r\n\r\nLondon.  Singapore, which had, by majority consent\r\n\r\nthrough a referendum accepted merger and Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwas  not  to  be  deterred  in  its  objective  of\r\n\r\nindependence  by  31st August, 1963,  despite  the\r\n\r\nferocity of Indonesian confrontation, whilst other\r\n\r\nsignatories  to the London Agreement dithered  and\r\n\r\ndallied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second occasion was on the 16th of September,\r\n\r\n1963, when Malaysia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"officially\"  came  into  being.  Whilst   we   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  accepted, in good faith, the conception\r\n\r\nof  a multi-racial Malaysia to be realised through\r\n\r\na  Malaysian Malaysia, yet during the two years in\r\n\r\nMalaysia, we suffered the traumatic experience  of\r\n\r\ntwo  heart-rending racial riots, and  thus  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  came  to  the rude awakening  that  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  in  Kuala Lumpur  were  not  thinking\r\n\r\nalong the same wavelength as us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Appendix to His Excellency's\r\n\r\nSpeech,  the separation of Singapore from Malaysia\r\n\r\ndid  not  affect our health services in  any  way,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  had autonomy in health  matters  when\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  in  Malaysia.  But  it  should  be\r\n\r\nrecorded that when Singapore was part of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nattendance  at international conferences  required\r\n\r\nSingapore's  representatives to  be  part  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian delegation, which is correct.  Yet,  for\r\n\r\nthe   18th   World  Health  Organisation  Assembly\r\n\r\nMeeting  held in Geneva in May this year, although\r\n\r\nthe  official  Malaysian delegation  consisted  of\r\n\r\nfour  delegates, yet Singapore was not  officially\r\n\r\ninvited by the then Central Government to  send  a\r\n\r\ndelegate.  Being  then  an  Opposition  Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament in the Malaysian Parliament,  I  tabled\r\n\r\nan  Oral Question to enquire why this was so;  and\r\n\r\nbelieve  it or not, Sir, the official reply  given\r\n\r\nwas that \"it was due to an oversight\"! There could\r\n\r\nonly   be   two  explanations:  one,   the   gross\r\n\r\ninefficiency    of    the    Central    Government\r\n\r\nauthorities, or, two, the then Central  Government\r\n\r\nalready   had   the  pathological  attitude   that\r\n\r\nSingapore, although then in Malaysia, was still  a\r\n\r\n\"foreign\"    country.   Either   explanation    is\r\n\r\nrevealing, and sad!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was that on 9th of August, 1965,\r\n\r\nSingapore  had  independence  thrust  on   it   by\r\n\r\nMalaysia. This should not be regarded as our third\r\n\r\ntry  at independence; rather that the dynamism and\r\n\r\nthe  virility of Singapore and its people  refused\r\n\r\nto   be  browbeaten,  bullied  or  cowed  by   the\r\n\r\nunreasonable   bludgeoning   from   the    Centre.\r\n\r\nSingapore could not be swallowed and digested, and\r\n\r\nhad  to  stay out! Singapore therefore now  stands\r\n\r\nproudly  as  an independent country,  amongst  the\r\n\r\nfamily of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough  we  may  be  the youngest  of  independent\r\n\r\ncountries, No. 22 in the Commonwealth and No.  117\r\n\r\nin  the  United  Nations, we  do  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nremain in that order of position where quality  of\r\n\r\nperformance or desire and ability to live in peace\r\n\r\nand  harmony amongst the troubled nations  of  the\r\n\r\nworld are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore stands at one of the most important\r\n\r\ncross-roads  of the world, and its  citizens  come\r\n\r\nfrom various racial stocks, which comprise many of\r\n\r\nthe world's peoples. With its multi-racial, \r\n\r\nmulti-lingual,    multi-cultural   and   multi-religious\r\n\r\ncomposition,  we  are a little United  Nations  in\r\n\r\nbeing.  Every effort should therefore be  made  to\r\n\r\nmake  Singapore a tolerant society as it had been,\r\n\r\nto  give  and take, and also to be united  as  one\r\n\r\npeople and to prosper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, however, be on our guard against those\r\n\r\nwho  have  evil thoughts and designs  of  wrecking\r\n\r\nthis   peace   and  harmony,  namely,   the   \r\n\r\npro-Communists,   the   pro-Communalists   and  \r\n\r\npro-Confrontationists.   Every   loyal   citizen    of\r\n\r\nSingapore  must decide to play a part in  exposing\r\n\r\nsuch  elements  in  order  to  help  preserve  our\r\n\r\ncountry and to make it more united and stronger so\r\n\r\nthat  we  may be better able to overcome our  many\r\n\r\npolitical  and economic problems. Let  it  not  be\r\n\r\nsaid that we, of this generation, were tested  and\r\n\r\nfound  wanting. Let it be recorded that Singapore,\r\n\r\non   attainment   of   its  sudden   independence,\r\n\r\nweathered  the  raging storms and  surged  forward\r\n\r\ninto greater prosperity and happiness because  all\r\n\r\nits peoples rallied together and, with courage and\r\n\r\nfortitude,   successfully  overcame  its   present\r\n\r\npolitical and economic difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, I would like to deal with certain\r\n\r\npoints  raised by the Hon. Member for  Punggol  on\r\n\r\nthe  White  Paper  for Family Planning  which  was\r\n\r\ntabled  in this House in September last.  Although\r\n\r\nhe  expressed certain doubts and fears because  of\r\n\r\nreligious  convictions, I am glad that he  started\r\n\r\noff  by  stating, and I quote - \"I would  be  very\r\n\r\nhappy, therefore, to support the Government  in  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  educate the people  towards  a  more\r\n\r\nresponsible  attitude  to  parenthood.\"  That   is\r\n\r\nexactly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  the  White Paper on Family Planning attempts\r\n\r\nto  do, that is, to increase welfare and happiness\r\n\r\nfor   all   in  Singapore,  and  only  responsible\r\n\r\nparenthood can do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, however, disagrees with\r\n\r\nthe  view  that smaller families of two  or  three\r\n\r\nchildren  are  necessarily  happier  than   larger\r\n\r\nfamilies. He is entitled to his opinion  and  even\r\n\r\nto  practise what he preaches by raising  a  large\r\n\r\nfamily  if he is so inclined. Paragraph 1.5,  Sir,\r\n\r\nof the White Paper goes as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Family Planning does not prevent those who\r\n\r\ndesire  large  families from having  them,  if  so\r\n\r\ninclined,  provided that the mother's health  [not\r\n\r\nin  this  case  the father's health, the  mother's\r\n\r\nhealth]  permits  such frequent child-bearing  and\r\n\r\n[here  the  husband  comes in] the  family  \r\n\r\nbread-winner  is  in  the  position to  earn  enough  to\r\n\r\nprovide  his children and family with a reasonable\r\n\r\nstandard  of living in basic necessities of  life,\r\n\r\nability  to  see  them through  school  and  other\r\n\r\nthings which make a comfortable and happy home'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But further down the paragraph is this very\r\n\r\nimportant  sentence  which points  out  that  many\r\n\r\nparents  are ignorant of family planning and  this\r\n\r\nis   where   it  is  the  responsibility   of   an\r\n\r\nenlightened Government to dispel such ignorance by\r\n\r\neducating  and informing such parents  that  there\r\n\r\nare  available  a  number of  methods  for  family\r\n\r\nplanning  and there are seven methods.  Now  these\r\n\r\nseven methods. The parents will be told that  some\r\n\r\nare   100  per  cent  effective  through  surgical\r\n\r\nligation, where certain things are cut, but  there\r\n\r\nare  other methods which are nearly 100  per  cent\r\n\r\neffective which are reversible, that is to say, if\r\n\r\nyou  practise  this,  it is nearly  100  per  cent\r\n\r\neffective, but if you do not wish to have it,  you\r\n\r\njust  stop  it,  then  you  are  back  again  into\r\n\r\ntrouble, shall we say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these nearly 100 per cent effective family\r\n\r\nplanning     methods    are    the    Intrauterine\r\n\r\nContraceptive Devices or the Contraceptive  Pills.\r\n\r\nThere  is what is called the \"menu card\" of  seven\r\n\r\nmethods for persons to choose from, and they  will\r\n\r\nbe  told  method  one, method two,  method  three,\r\n\r\nmethod four and so on down the line until a method\r\n\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  gives 25 per cent protection. Well,  if  the\r\n\r\nmother chooses that 25 per cent protection and she\r\n\r\ncomes within the other 75 per cent which does  not\r\n\r\nprove effective, well, she has asked for it - like\r\n\r\nthe T.V. film called \"You Asked For It\"! So it  is\r\n\r\nfor  the married mother in these circumstances  to\r\n\r\ndecide which method she prefers -the 100 per  cent\r\n\r\neffective  method, the 90 per  cent,  the  70  per\r\n\r\ncent, the 50 per cent or the 25 per cent effective\r\n\r\nmethod.  There  is no question of compulsion,  but\r\n\r\none  of choice and what her conscience prompts her\r\n\r\nto  decide. The very first paragraph of the  White\r\n\r\nPaper goes as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is the intention of the Singapore Government,\r\n\r\nunder  its  Second 5-Year Development Plan \r\n\r\n(1966-70),  to bring the message to every married  woman\r\n\r\n[not  every woman, but every married woman, it  is\r\n\r\nbeing very carefully worded] (within the fertility\r\n\r\nrange)  [that is, between the ages of 15  and \r\n\r\n44-there are mothers who at 55 still give birth,  but\r\n\r\nthat is a rare exception. We are concentrating  on\r\n\r\nthose  who  will  give  birth  more  readily.]  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   that   Family  Planning   brings   her\r\n\r\nimmeasurable  benefits. And, at her request,  [not\r\n\r\nat  the  Government's request, but at the  woman's\r\n\r\nrequest;  she  wants  something  done,  she  wants\r\n\r\nknowledge, she wants a helping hand] to advise her\r\n\r\non  the  best available methods of Family Planning\r\n\r\nwhich will be simple, inexpensive and safe.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there can be no victimisation of the poor nor\r\n\r\nmoral  blackmail of mothers in receipt  of  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  assistance that unless  they  consent  to\r\n\r\nfamily  planning, they may not get any assistance.\r\n\r\nThe White Paper on Family Planning is intended  to\r\n\r\nextend  help  to such poor destitute mothers  from\r\n\r\nfalling  into greater tragedy and the disaster  of\r\n\r\nbearing  yet  more children when  she  is  already\r\n\r\nincapable of earning a livelihood to feed not only\r\n\r\nherself and whatever children she already has from\r\n\r\nher unemployed husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such social welfare cases there will be no\r\n\r\ncharge for services rendered, but for others there\r\n\r\nwill  be a nominal charge for such family planning\r\n\r\nservices. For example, we intend to charge only  a\r\n\r\nnominal  $10.00 for an intrauterine  contraceptive\r\n\r\ndevice   insertion   which   is   only   a    very\r\n\r\ninsignificant percentage \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  what is now being charged by  certain\r\n\r\nprivate practitioners for such a service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no hesitation in assuring the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Punggol  that  no doctor, nurse,  midwife  or\r\n\r\nstaff  will be ordered to do anything which  would\r\n\r\nrun counter to any of their religious scruples  or\r\n\r\nprejudices,  if  any, under the Government  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  programme; but, on  the  other  hand,  I\r\n\r\nwould expect such members of staff to declare  why\r\n\r\nthey  wish to be exempted from such work, and,  on\r\n\r\ntheir part, do not stand in the way of others  who\r\n\r\nmay desire and wish such family planning advice or\r\n\r\nhelp.  In  other  words, if you think  you  cannot\r\n\r\npractise this method, please keep off, but do  not\r\n\r\nstop others who are queuing up for such service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I completely disagree with the\r\n\r\nfears  held  by the Member for Punggol  that  this\r\n\r\nfamily planning campaign will result, I quote, \"in\r\n\r\ngrave  danger of lowering the whole moral tone  of\r\n\r\nour  people.\" He is a brave man who dares to  cast\r\n\r\nmoral   judgment  on  another.  Besides,   certain\r\n\r\nmorals,  like fashions, are one of relativity  and\r\n\r\nwould  appear to change with the times. I  see  no\r\n\r\ndanger  of  moral laxity in Singapore as envisaged\r\n\r\nby the imaginative mind of the Member for Punggol,\r\n\r\nbut I am quite certain and emphatic that our White\r\n\r\nPaper  on Family Planning will prove a great  boon\r\n\r\nto  our  married women folk, because they will  be\r\n\r\nliberated  from the burden of bearing and  raising\r\n\r\nan  unnecessarily large number of children and, as\r\n\r\na  consequence,  to increase human  happiness  for\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a little bit\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  conduct debates in this  Parliament\r\n\r\nbecause of the situation where you do not have  an\r\n\r\nOpposition!  For  a  good  debate  there  must  be\r\n\r\nstimulus  and  response.  We  have  not  got   the\r\n\r\nstimulus because the Barisan Sosialis, for reasons\r\n\r\nbest  known  to themselves, have decided  to  stay\r\n\r\naway  from  the  Assembly  -  but  I  have  enough\r\n\r\nimagination to visualise them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  front  of me to provide the necessary stimulus\r\n\r\nespecially  on  the  question of  foreign  policy,\r\n\r\nwhich is a matter dear to their hearts. So I would\r\n\r\nfirst  like  to state that when we  come  to  talk\r\n\r\nabout  the foreign policy of a country, there  are\r\n\r\ntwo  senses in which we can do so. We can identify\r\n\r\nits foreign policy by the statements of principles\r\n\r\nand  objectives  propounded by the  leaders  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry.  These are generally very reassuring  and\r\n\r\ninfused with high moral purposes, but these do not\r\n\r\nnecessarily constitute the foreign policy  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another sense in which we can talk\r\n\r\nof  a  foreign policy, in that we can abstract  it\r\n\r\nfrom the concrete decisions and actions taken by a\r\n\r\ncountry  on  specific international  issues.  From\r\n\r\nthese  we can abstract what the country's  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  is.  In other words, there  is  a  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  of  words, of principles, and there  is  a\r\n\r\nforeign  policy of deeds. For practical  purposes,\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  policy of deeds is a  more  reliable\r\n\r\nguide  to  the  intentions of a country  than  its\r\n\r\ndeclared  and invariably reassuring principles.  I\r\n\r\nam  not  saying that the enunciated foreign policy\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  a country are irrelevant  or  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  have  any bearing  on  its  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy.  They can and very often do.  They  denote\r\n\r\nwhat  a  country would like to do, though  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  of  hard realities it may be forced  to  do\r\n\r\nthings  which  do  not quite  harmonise  with  its\r\n\r\nproclaimed principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary for Singapore, which is\r\n\r\nventuring  for the first time into the  jungle  of\r\n\r\ninternational  politics, to bear  in  mind  always\r\n\r\nthese two kinds of foreign policy. We should be on\r\n\r\nthe  look-out  for possible discrepancies  between\r\n\r\ndeeds  and  words  in  the  foreign  policy  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry.  Only then can we devise our own  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  which is sound and realistic. For example,\r\n\r\nwe  should  not  be lulled into a false  sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity just because a country professes  undying\r\n\r\nfriendship  and  high regard for us  or  proclaims\r\n\r\npeace  and goodwill to all men. We should  satisfy\r\n\r\nourselves  first  that these proclamations  accord\r\n\r\nwith what it does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the fact that a country does not like\r\n\r\nus as a matter of principle (maybe because they do\r\n\r\nnot  approve of the system of government we  have,\r\n\r\nor because they do not approve some of the actions\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  chosen  to do),  this  should  not\r\n\r\npreclude normal relations between us and them.  So\r\n\r\nlong  as  they do not translate their  theoretical\r\n\r\ndisapproval  of us into deeds, we are prepared  to\r\n\r\nenter  into  relations with them.  Of  course,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be better if they say friendly things about\r\n\r\nus  even  as they enter into peaceful and workable\r\n\r\nrelations  with  us. But if that cannot  be  done,\r\n\r\nthen we would be satisfied with a friendly foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  of deeds. So in shaping our foreign policy\r\n\r\nwe  should  have a clear idea of which category  a\r\n\r\ncountry comes under, for upon this will depend the\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  friendship  and  closeness  with  it.\r\n\r\nWhile,  generally speaking, we are sincere in  our\r\n\r\nwish  to be friendly with all countries which want\r\n\r\nto  be  friends  with us, in  the  hard  world  of\r\n\r\ninternational  realities there  are  bound  to  he\r\n\r\ndegrees  of  friendship between  countries.  Those\r\n\r\nclosest  to  us will naturally he those  countries\r\n\r\nwhose foreign policy principles and deeds coincide\r\n\r\nwith   our   national  interests  and  our   basic\r\n\r\naspirations.  We  may  from  time  to  time   have\r\n\r\ndisagreements with them on specific issues, hut so\r\n\r\nlong  as the fundamentals of their foreign  policy\r\n\r\nand  the  deeds with which they hack them coincide\r\n\r\nwith  our basic national interests and objectives,\r\n\r\nthey  will continue to remain our closest  friends\r\n\r\nand   allies.   We  should  not  allow   temporary\r\n\r\nirritations and minor disagreements between us and\r\n\r\nthem  to cause us to abandon them as our permanent\r\n\r\nand secure friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of countries are those which\r\n\r\nmay  have to be unfriendly with us in theory  (for\r\n\r\nideological  reasons or because of the  exigencies\r\n\r\nof  domestic  politics) while developing  friendly\r\n\r\nand  normal relations with us in practice. So long\r\n\r\nas  the  practice  is  friendly,  we  are  equally\r\n\r\nprepared  to  be friendly with them,  though  this\r\n\r\nfriendliness  will  have to be  qualified  by  the\r\n\r\nrealisation  that  the  friendliness  is  not   as\r\n\r\ncomplete  as  we  would  like  it  to  be.  In   a\r\n\r\nrelationship of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  kind  - the second category  -  there  is\r\n\r\nalways  the  hope  that  the  friendly  relations,\r\n\r\nhowever  tentative and however cautious, could  in\r\n\r\ncourse  of time and with good sense on both sides,\r\n\r\nmature  into  friendship of  the  first  category.\r\n\r\nThese   things  can  happen  and  do   happen   in\r\n\r\ninternational relations. For example, during World\r\n\r\nWar  II, the Americans and Russians were the  best\r\n\r\nof  friends, so much so that they combined  forces\r\n\r\nto  bring  to heel Germany and Japan -  by  mutual\r\n\r\nagreement  then  their No. 1  enemies.  But  since\r\n\r\nWorld  War  II,  Germany  and  Japan  have  become\r\n\r\nAmerica's  No.  1  friends - more  so  than  their\r\n\r\nwartime ally, the Soviet Union. So the friends  of\r\n\r\ntoday  or  the enemies of today need  not  be  the\r\n\r\nenemies of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in international politics, it is not\r\n\r\nwise to formulate foreign policies on the basis of\r\n\r\npermanent  enemies, especially  in  the  twentieth\r\n\r\ncentury  world  of  convulsive changes  and  rapid\r\n\r\nshifts  in the balance of political forces  within\r\n\r\ncountries. Singapore's foreign policy, based on  a\r\n\r\nrealistic  appraisal of the position we occupy  in\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia, will therefore not be postulated\r\n\r\non  the  basis of permanent enemies. Ours will  be\r\n\r\nthe  more positive approach of cultivating as many\r\n\r\npermanent friends as we are capable of.  We  shall\r\n\r\ntherefore  strive to convert this second  category\r\n\r\nof  friendship in so far as we can into the  first\r\n\r\ncategory  of  friendship,  of  permanent  friends.\r\n\r\nThere will he no fixed and inflexible attitudes in\r\n\r\nregard to these countries. We shall not take  wild\r\n\r\nand  angry postures if from time to time in  their\r\n\r\nforeign  policy of words they say something  which\r\n\r\nis  not  pleasing to us, so long as their  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  of  deeds remains correct and  reassuring.\r\n\r\nHere  patience  backed with some understanding  of\r\n\r\nwhy  they  have to say the things that  they  say,\r\n\r\nmight  pay  dividends and it could  prevent  their\r\n\r\ndrifting into the third category of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of nations are the nations\r\n\r\nwhose  foreign policy of words are as hostile  and\r\n\r\ndangerous  to  our  national  interests  as  their\r\n\r\nforeign  policy of deeds. Fortunately for  us,  no\r\n\r\ncountry  has  so  far officially  elected  to  put\r\n\r\nitself in this category vis-a-vis an independent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  True, there are elements in Singapore,\r\n\r\nlike the Barisan Sosialis, who are exhorting other\r\n\r\ncountries to place themselves in this category\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis Singapore. Under the hilarious leadership of\r\n\r\nDr  Lee  Siew  Choh,  for  example,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are trying to convince certain countries\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore's  independence  is  phoney,  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is a tool of Anglo-American imperialism.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Barisan Sosialis leaders think that\r\n\r\nin  doing this they are acting like good Marxists.\r\n\r\nMy  view  - and this may also be the view  of  the\r\n\r\ncountries  to which their appeals are  made  -  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Barisan Sosialis brand of  Marxism  has\r\n\r\nmore  in  common  with  the  lunacy  of  the  Marx\r\n\r\nbrothers  than with the thoughts of the author  of\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  Manifesto.  The  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nleaders  -  if  you will permit this  euphemism  \r\n\r\n- would  be  well  advised to  re-read  the  opening\r\n\r\nsentence of the Communist Manifesto which goes  \"A\r\n\r\nseptre   is  haunting  Europe...\".   A  septre   is\r\n\r\ncertainly haunting the Barisan Sosialis  and  also\r\n\r\ntheir  friends  who  not  so  long  ago  fled   to\r\n\r\nIndonesia  to help do in the people of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThese  comrades  absconded  to  Indonesia  on  the\r\n\r\npretext that they wanted to liberate Singapore, to\r\n\r\nfree  it  from the fetters of British  colonialism\r\n\r\nand  Malayan  feudalism. But all we know  is  that\r\n\r\nthey sent terrorists from Indonesia who killed and\r\n\r\nmaimed  not British colonial soldiers but a number\r\n\r\nof innocent and decent Singaporeans, including two\r\n\r\nwomen bank employees. They make no distinction  of\r\n\r\nthe sexes in these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither these self-exiled comrades-on-the-run\r\n\r\nnor  their  less  adventurous  cheer  leaders  who\r\n\r\nelected  to stay in Singapore contributed anything\r\n\r\ntowards the emergence of an independent Singapore.\r\n\r\nEven  as  terrorists from Indonesia  slipped  into\r\n\r\nSingapore with bombs and hand grenades, Singapore,\r\n\r\ndespite  the  scheming  and obstruction  by  \r\n\r\nanti-national   elements,   found  itself   independent\r\n\r\nwithout  bloodshed, without turmoil,  and  without\r\n\r\nany  damage to the social and economic life of the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  so-called revolutionary  methods  of\r\n\r\nstruggle  advocated  by  the  Communists  and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, it is clear to the people,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachieved   nothing.   Revolutionary   methods   of\r\n\r\nstruggle,  as interpreted and practised  by  local\r\n\r\nCommunists  and apprentice Communists,  have  been\r\n\r\nbarren  of results in Malaya, in Malaysia  and  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independence has come to Singapore not because of\r\n\r\nthe  so-called revolutionary struggles or  methods\r\n\r\nof  struggle of the local Communists, but in spite\r\n\r\nof them. The Barisan Sosialis therefore now try to\r\n\r\ncover up their bitter failures by pretending  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  independence is phoney. In  order  to\r\n\r\nsustain this fantasy of phoney independence,  they\r\n\r\nare  compelled to create other and new  fantasies.\r\n\r\nFor example, in their Party journal, The Plebeian,\r\n\r\nthey  claim  that  Singapore's  independence   and\r\n\r\nsovereignty has been acknowledged only  by  \r\n\r\nAnglo-American imperialists and their stooges. In  fact,\r\n\r\nsome  116  countries  represented  in  the  United\r\n\r\nNations voted for the admission of Singapore  into\r\n\r\nthe  world  body.  There has,  in  addition,  been\r\n\r\nformal  recognition by individual  countries.  The\r\n\r\nrecent  Goodwill Mission, led by the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  was  officially received by  Afro-Asian\r\n\r\nand   Communist   countries  it   visited.   These\r\n\r\ncountries  would  not have officially  received  a\r\n\r\ncountry whose independence they doubted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Barisan Sosialis leaders evade the truth\r\n\r\nabout  the reality of Singapore's independence  by\r\n\r\npronouncing  the  United Nations  a  tool  of  the\r\n\r\nAmerican  imperialists  and the  countries  which\r\n\r\nreceived  us  as  stooges  of  the  Anglo-American\r\n\r\nimperialists.  In  other words,  the  116  nations\r\n\r\nwhich  voted  for the admission of Singapore  are,\r\n\r\naccording  to the Barisan Sosialis, the  tools  of\r\n\r\nthe  Americans. That goes, I presume, for Albania,\r\n\r\ntoo,  because  it too voted for the  admission  of\r\n\r\nSingapore into the United Nations. If the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   thesis  is  correct,   then   President\r\n\r\nKenyatta,  President Nyerere,  President  Nkrumah,\r\n\r\nPresident Nasser and many other Heads of State who\r\n\r\nextended personal messages recognising Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence  must be Anglo-American  imperialist\r\n\r\nstooges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of political lunacy is carried to\r\n\r\nastonishing lengths when the Barisan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSosialis move an amended foreign policy motion for\r\n\r\nthe consideration of this House demanding that  we\r\n\r\nadopt  a  foreign policy \"friendly  to  Afro-Asian\r\n\r\ncountries\".  This is illogical.  They  argue  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  independence is phoney.  On  the  one\r\n\r\nhand, the Barisan Sosialis leaders are busy asking\r\n\r\nthe  Afro-Asian countries to have  nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore  because  they  claim  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence  is phoney. On the other  hand,  they\r\n\r\nmove  an  amended motion demanding that we  should\r\n\r\nestablish   friendly  relations  with   Afro-Asian\r\n\r\ncountries,  which the Afro-Asian countries  cannot\r\n\r\ndo  if  they  believe the Barisan Sosialis  thesis\r\n\r\nthat Singapore's independence is phoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, I humbly submit, Mr Speaker, is\r\n\r\nincontrovertible  evidence of  a  fairly  advanced\r\n\r\nstate  of  political  lunacy  within  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  fold. The Barisan Sosialis may not  know\r\n\r\nit.  In fact, I am convinced they do not. But  the\r\n\r\ncountries  to which they are making these  frantic\r\n\r\nappeals to adopt a hostile foreign policy of words\r\n\r\nas  well as of deeds must surely be aware of this.\r\n\r\nIn   listening  to  pronouncements  of  the  local\r\n\r\nCommunists,  such countries should be  aware  that\r\n\r\nthey are listening to people who are inept because\r\n\r\nof a chronic inability to distinguish between fact\r\n\r\nand  fantasy, to political leaders and a political\r\n\r\nmovement which has been discredited in the eyes of\r\n\r\nour  people. It may well be that there is a  clear\r\n\r\ngrasp in certain Afro-Asian countries that a Party\r\n\r\nlike the Barisan Sosialis is an expendable coterie\r\n\r\nof ineffectual clowns to play around with for lack\r\n\r\nof  something  better. It may be convenient,  from\r\n\r\nthe  point  of view of these countries, to  humour\r\n\r\nthem  into  believing that they are advancing  the\r\n\r\ncause  of  socialist revolution. If that  is  all,\r\n\r\nthen  we are content, because we for our part  can\r\n\r\ndeal effectively with the Barisan Sosialis and the\r\n\r\nlocal  Communists. In fact, we can well afford  to\r\n\r\nallow  the Barisan Sosialis to play at revolution.\r\n\r\nShould they or their Communist mentors exceed  the\r\n\r\nhounds set by the law and the Constitution, we are\r\n\r\nequally  capable of checking them there  too.  For\r\n\r\nexample,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  all right with us and the country  if  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis   choose   to   conduct   their\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  struggle by the simple  process  of\r\n\r\nabsenting themselves from this Chamber. They  have\r\n\r\nnot  broken the law or the Constitution  by  doing\r\n\r\nthis.  And at the end of the month, they  will  be\r\n\r\npaid  their $500, and for so long as the  law  and\r\n\r\nthe Constitution prescribe they should be paid. If\r\n\r\nknowing the law and the Constitution in regard  to\r\n\r\nthe   remuneration  of  Assemblymen,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  representatives return to do their  duty\r\n\r\nby their electors, then they would still be acting\r\n\r\nconstitutionally and no harm will befall them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But insofar as our foreign policy is concerned,\r\n\r\nwhat is important is that the local Communists and\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis should not  be  treated  by\r\n\r\noutside countries as their special responsibility,\r\n\r\nwhen  in fact it is a domestic problem for  us  to\r\n\r\nsolve.   We  do  not  care  if  foreign  countries\r\n\r\nsympathise  with the Barisan Sosialis  or  anybody\r\n\r\nelse  or  even  wish the local Communists  were  a\r\n\r\nlittle  more intelligent than they have been.  But\r\n\r\nwhat we ask in the conduct of foreign relations is\r\n\r\nthat  these private sympathies and regrets  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed to obtrude into the relations  of\r\n\r\nforeign  countries with us. The fate and  fortunes\r\n\r\nof  the  local Communists should not be  made  an\r\n\r\nactive   concern  in  the  relationships   foreign\r\n\r\ncountries establish with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally, the fate and fortunes of anti-Communists\r\n\r\nor  racialists  should  not  be  made  the  active\r\n\r\nconcern  of  countries which  seek  to  establish\r\n\r\nrelations  with us. In a democratic  country  like\r\n\r\nours,  there  have  been and  will  be  contending\r\n\r\npolitical Parties striving for power on the  basis\r\n\r\nof   different  ideologies  consistent  with   our\r\n\r\nConstitution. It is natural for outside  countries\r\n\r\nto feel sympathy for this or that Party or even to\r\n\r\npray  for  the victory of a particular Party.  But\r\n\r\nfriendly  relations between us and other countries\r\n\r\nbecome  difficult  and even  impossible  when  the\r\n\r\nsympathy  of an interested observer is transformed\r\n\r\ninto active interference in our national affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Barisan Sosialis may prattle about\r\n\r\nphoney  independence,  this  Government  and   our\r\n\r\npeople accept the reality\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our independence, and our foreign policy  will\r\n\r\nbe  directed  towards  the  safeguarding  of  this\r\n\r\nindependence. It does not matter if some countries\r\n\r\ndo not believe in the reality of our independence.\r\n\r\nIt  is  sufficient for the purposes of our foreign\r\n\r\npolicy  that we believe in the genuineness of  our\r\n\r\nindependence,  that the overwhelming  majority  of\r\n\r\nthe   people   of   Singapore   believe   in   our\r\n\r\nindependence,  and that the vast majority  of  the\r\n\r\nnations of the world accept our independence. This\r\n\r\nbeing   so,  genuine  respect  for  our  political\r\n\r\nintegrity  and independence must be  an  essential\r\n\r\nelement  in  relationships between us and  foreign\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary task of our foreign policy will\r\n\r\nalways  be  to  safeguard  our  independence  from\r\n\r\nexternal  threats.  We shall try  to  do  this  by\r\n\r\nestablishing   friendly   relations    with    all\r\n\r\ncountries, particularly those nearest to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way of establishing friendly\r\n\r\ninternational relations is to support any measure,\r\n\r\nwhether  on a regional basis or through  concerted\r\n\r\ninternational action via the United Nations, which\r\n\r\nwill enhance prospects for peace in this region by\r\n\r\nreducing tensions and fears. Because Singapore  is\r\n\r\nregarded by the world and by our neighbours  as  a\r\n\r\nstrategic  key in this area, we shall ensure  that\r\n\r\nour  foreign policy and our defence policy do  not\r\n\r\nincrease  tensions and fears among our neighbours.\r\n\r\nWe  are well aware that South-East Asia is in fact\r\n\r\na  battle-ground of great power politics and  that\r\n\r\nSingapore   could,  as  a  pawn  of   some   other\r\n\r\ncountries, decide the outcome of the military game\r\n\r\nthe big powers are playing in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are aware of this, our foreign policy\r\n\r\nand  our defence policy must ensure that we do not\r\n\r\nbecome, or even appear to become, the pawn of  any\r\n\r\noutside  power.  If this were to happen,  then  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  that  much nearer to  a  real  military\r\n\r\nconflict in this area. Therefore, the contribution\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore can make towards peace  in \r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia  is  not  to side  with  this  or  that\r\n\r\ncontending power bloc, or become the pawn  of  any\r\n\r\none  of  them. So long as Singapore does not  fall\r\n\r\ninto  the hands of any one contending power  bloc,\r\n\r\nwe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  ensuring  that  they are  not  panicked  into\r\n\r\ntaking desperate and dangerous counter measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the reason, Sir, why immediately on\r\n\r\nindependence we declared ourselves non-aligned. It\r\n\r\nwas not, as some people believed, simply a case of\r\n\r\nSingapore following a current Afro-Asian fad!  For\r\n\r\nan  independent Singapore, which is also important\r\n\r\nstrategically, to have aligned itself with this or\r\n\r\nthat  power  bloc  was  to  have  invited  counter\r\n\r\nreaction  from  its rivals. It  would  have  meant\r\n\r\nSingapore,  an independent Singapore, being  drawn\r\n\r\nwilly-nilly  into the big power conflicts  already\r\n\r\nraging in South-East Asia, and thus enlarging  the\r\n\r\narena of active conflict. More important, it would\r\n\r\nhave  also  meant  jeopardising our  recently  won\r\n\r\nindependence.  Alignment with  one  of  the  power\r\n\r\nblocs  means aligning oneself completely with  its\r\n\r\nmajor military and foreign policy objectives.  And\r\n\r\nwhen  a small country like Singapore aligns itself\r\n\r\nwith  a  big power, there is no doubt  as  to  who\r\n\r\nkeeps in step with whose policies. In other words,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  foreign policy,  if  it  is  aligned,\r\n\r\nbecomes a copy reproduction of the foreign  policy\r\n\r\nof its more powerful partner. Maybe to keep up the\r\n\r\nillusion  of  independence, the  major  power  may\r\n\r\npermit  or tolerate disagreements in minor matters\r\n\r\nof  foreign policy, but in fundamental matters, we\r\n\r\nwould have to stand smartly to attention when  the\r\n\r\nroll call is made on any issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a country has put itself in a position of\r\n\r\nhaving  to  follow the foreign policy  of  another\r\n\r\ncountry, there must eventually be loss of  freedom\r\n\r\nof  action  in regard to basic domestic  policies.\r\n\r\nIf, as it is generally accepted, foreign policy is\r\n\r\npromotion  and  protection of  national  interests\r\n\r\nthrough appropriate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninternational actions, a policy of alignment  with\r\n\r\na  big  power means promotion not of our  national\r\n\r\ninterests but those of the big power. That is  why\r\n\r\nwe  are  loath to join in any international  \r\n\r\nanti-Communist  crusade, because we  are  non-Communist\r\n\r\nSocialists at home; because we believe -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.
