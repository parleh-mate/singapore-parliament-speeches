Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  yesterday  I  was  engaged  in  the  topic   of\r\n\r\nprincipals  of  schools before we were terrorised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Environmental Public Health Bill. I was  calling\r\n\r\nupon   the  principals  of  schools  to  make   their\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  education in a  form  beyond  their\r\n\r\nadministrative  duties as heads  of  schools.  I  was\r\n\r\ncalling upon them to apply their minds to problems in\r\n\r\neducation  relevant  to the times  and,  especially,.\r\n\r\nrelevant  perhaps to their respective localities  and\r\n\r\nschools  and  to  put  this  thinking  on  paper  for\r\n\r\nsubmission to the Ministry of Education and  also  to\r\n\r\nbe  published and sorted out for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nteaching profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the heads of schools, having stored up that\r\n\r\nmuch experience and ability to merit their appointments  as  heads  of  schools  by  the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission,  should gladly  undertake  these\r\n\r\nduties   without  insistence  on  the  part  of   the\r\n\r\nMinistry, and I certainly would look forward to  such\r\n\r\nresponses  from principals of schools. But they  also\r\n\r\nhave hard times these days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer the Minister to the last\r\n\r\nappointment  of principals of primary schools.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know whether this may be within the ambit of the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission. If it is, the Minister can\r\n\r\nstill  do  something to remedy what  I  think  is  an\r\n\r\nundesirable situation. The appointment of the  princi\r\n\r\npals of primary schools was last made on the basis of\r\n\r\na  circular  to the schools calling for  applications\r\n\r\nfor this appointment and the indication was that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappointment   was   meant   to   be   a   substantive\r\n\r\nappointment.  A  number  of applications  were  made.\r\n\r\nSubsequent  interviews  followed,  and  then   short-listing, and eventually the appointment was  made  in\r\n\r\ntwo  categories. One was a category of appointees who\r\n\r\nwere   appointed   substantively   with   the   usual\r\n\r\nprobationary period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other category was a category of appointees who\r\n\r\nwere  informed  that  they  were  rejected  for   the\r\n\r\nsubstantive  appointments but that they  were  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed  in an acting capacity until one year  from\r\n\r\nthe  date  of the appointment or until the  incumbent\r\n\r\nfor  the  post  arrived. This would  mean  that  this\r\n\r\nsecond   category  of  appointees  would  revert   to\r\n\r\nteaching and they would suffer some embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is alarming is that when some of these\r\n\r\nappointees  approached the officials in the  Ministry\r\n\r\nand  indicated that this was something for which they\r\n\r\nhad  not bargained, and when they asked whether  they\r\n\r\ncould  refuse  the  second type  of  appointment,  it\r\n\r\nappeared  that  they were informed that  they  could,\r\n\r\nprovided they signed certain documents to the  effect\r\n\r\nthat  they  reject the appointment on condition  that\r\n\r\nthey    are    prepared   to   forfeit    promotional\r\n\r\nopportunities which may come their way in the future.\r\n\r\nIf  this  is  so,  I think this is a very  iniquitous\r\n\r\npractice on the part of the Ministry, it is unfair to\r\n\r\nthese applicants. It is just like inviting a guest to\r\n\r\nyour  house  for a cocktail party and as soon  as  he\r\n\r\ngets  into your house, you grab him by the scruff  of\r\n\r\nhis neck and drag him to the backyard to clean up the\r\n\r\nmess,  perhaps in preparation for the \"Keep Singapore\r\n\r\nClean\"  campaign! And when he protests, you  threaten\r\n\r\nto  blow  off his brains with a blunderbuss. I  think\r\n\r\nthis situation ought to be resolved somehow or other,\r\n\r\nbecause I understand that they have been informed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  that their appointments would  proceed\r\n\r\nuntil  further  notice  - in  other  words,  until  a\r\n\r\nfurther  one  year from the date on which  they  were\r\n\r\nlast  notified or until the incumbent came  along  to\r\n\r\ndisplace them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will look into this situation\r\n\r\nwith a view to remedying an undesirable situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  prior to the setting up of the Harvey  Salaries\r\n\r\nCommission   by  our  Government,  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  administered numerous  salary  scales  for\r\n\r\nvarious   categories  of  teachers   with   resultant\r\n\r\nanomalies  and injustices. It was hoped by  all  that\r\n\r\nwith   the  publication  of  the  findings   of   the\r\n\r\nCommission,  comprehensive  and  effective   measures\r\n\r\nwould  be adopted to do away with, once and for  all,\r\n\r\nthe   innumerable  ramifications  of  the  prevailing\r\n\r\nanomalies  and that a unified salary structure  would\r\n\r\nbe drawn up. It is true that some anomalies have been\r\n\r\nrectified,  but the overall position in the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education remains as unsatisfactory as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of issues which were considered\r\n\r\nnot only by the unions representing the employees but\r\n\r\nalso  the Ministry of Education and: the Treasury  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  dire need of an equitable rectification.  But\r\n\r\nthe Harvey Commission appeared to have overlooked the\r\n\r\nrepresentations made by the Ministry of Education  as\r\n\r\nwell as by the unions representing the teachers. I am\r\n\r\nsure  it  is  not too late to rectify  the  anomalies\r\n\r\nsince  both  parties - the Ministry of Education  and\r\n\r\nthe  unions  representing the teachers -  agree  that\r\n\r\nthere is a need for rectification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, there are two outstanding issues that\r\n\r\nshould  be  resolved without any further delay:  one,\r\n\r\nremuneration to the senior assistants and two, salary\r\n\r\nscales  for  promotion  posts  in  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1950's, all schools that operated two\r\n\r\nsessions had one principal for each session. However,\r\n\r\nwith   the  intensification  of  the  school-building\r\n\r\nprogramme,  the  shortage of senior  and  experienced\r\n\r\nteachers for promotion as principals became so  acute\r\n\r\nthat,  as  a  temporary  measure,  the  practice   of\r\n\r\nappointing   one  principal  for  both  morning   and\r\n\r\nafternoon  sessions was adopted. Unfortunately,  this\r\n\r\ntemporary measure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecame, with the passage of time, a permanent  policy\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry of Education and,  at  the  moment,\r\n\r\nthere is only one principal for both the morning  and\r\n\r\nafternoon   sessions.  Where  principals  cannot   be\r\n\r\npresent   throughout  the  whole  of  the   afternoon\r\n\r\nsession,  senior  assistants are  then  appointed  to\r\n\r\nmanage   the  school  for  and  on  behalf   of   the\r\n\r\nprincipals.  These senior assistants  are  not  given\r\n\r\nadditional  remuneration although they  are  made  to\r\n\r\nshoulder  additional responsibilities. After repeated\r\n\r\nrepresentations  by  the  unions,  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  agreed  with the unions  that  it  was  an\r\n\r\ninequitable  situation which had to be rectified  and\r\n\r\nthat a recommendation to this effect would be made by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry to the Harvey Salaries Commission.  But\r\n\r\nit  appears  that the Harvey Salaries Commission  has\r\n\r\nnot  given  any  consideration to this recommendation\r\n\r\nmade by both the unions and the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education is the only Government\r\n\r\ndepartment  where  promotion  posts  do   not   carry\r\n\r\ndifferent  salary  scales but only  allowances.  This\r\n\r\npractice  is  still continuing in spite of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry of Education as well as the unions\r\n\r\nhave  agreed  on numerous occasions that  it  creates\r\n\r\ninjustices in many ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the circumstances which I have just set\r\n\r\nout, I hope the Minister for Education will take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary   action  to  remove  these  anomalies   by\r\n\r\nentering  into negotiations with the unions in  order\r\n\r\nto  bring  about an amicable and equitable settlement\r\n\r\nof the issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the Harvey Salaries Commission\r\n\r\nhas  recommended in paragraph 198 of its Report  that\r\n\r\nthe  structure and reorganisation of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation must be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, at the same time, congratulate the Ministry of Education on being far- sighted and willing to rectify mistakes made by the Harvey Salaries Comniission. I refer to a newspaper report yesterday that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education had entered into negotiations\r\n\r\nwith  the  Malay  Teachers' Union on the  unduly  and\r\n\r\nunreasonably  depressed salary scales recommended  by\r\n\r\nthe Harvey Salaries Commission for religious teachers\r\n\r\nin Singapore. Sir, we recognise that no one, not even\r\n\r\na commission of eminent persons, is infallible. It is\r\n\r\nquite  obvious  that  the Harvey Salaries  Commission\r\n\r\nhas,   unintentionally  or  unwittingly,  made   some\r\n\r\nrecommendations  which are not in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\naspirations   of  our  Republic  and  or   with   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the various Government departments\r\n\r\nand the employees' unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commendable that the Government has accepted\r\n\r\nthe  Commission's recommendations with some  modifica\r\n\r\ntions. There is scope for further adjustments of  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations as the negotiations going on  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  between  the Ministry of  Education  and  the\r\n\r\nMalay Teachers' Union clearly indicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I enquire from the Minister if further\r\n\r\nnegotiations  will be conducted between the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education  and other categories  of  teachers  on\r\n\r\nsimilar  findings  of  the Commission  which  do  not\r\n\r\nappear to have taken into adequate consideration  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations made by the Government, as well as by\r\n\r\nthe employees' unions? Sir, in the private sector, if\r\n\r\nboth  the employers' and employees' unions agree that\r\n\r\na  certain  category  of  posts  can  and  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered   as   promotion  posts,   the   resultant\r\n\r\nnegotiations  conducted by the parties  involved  are\r\n\r\nconfined to the quantum of remuneration for  the  pro\r\n\r\nmotion posts. In other words, the dispute centres  on\r\n\r\nthe  fair and equitable remuneration that is  payable\r\n\r\nto  the holders of the promotion posts. The terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  negotiated settlement are then incorporated into\r\n\r\na  collective  agreement which sets  out  the  salary\r\n\r\nscales  for  such posts and it is duly certified  and\r\n\r\nregistered  by the Industrial Arbitration  Court~  In\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education, there are two issues which\r\n\r\nmerit similar treatment and yet the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvey Salaries Commission has somehow overlooked the\r\n\r\nrecommendations made by the employers as well  as  by\r\n\r\nthe employees' unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, although written papers on  particular\r\n\r\neducational  problems have not been  submitted  on  a\r\n\r\nformal   basis  by  principals  of  schools  to   the\r\n\r\nadministration,  the  views of  principals  are  made\r\n\r\nknown  to senior officers of the Ministry at  regular\r\n\r\nmeetings  of  principals  of  schools.  However,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon Gardens has suggested that  the\r\n\r\nprincipals  should  put their  minds  to  educational\r\n\r\nproblems, especially those which are related to their\r\n\r\nown  schools and that they should submit  papers  for\r\n\r\nfurther  study.  This  is  a constructive  suggestion\r\n\r\nwhich  I shall take up in due course. Certainly,  the\r\n\r\nexperience of principals accumulated over a period of\r\n\r\nyears should not be left untapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 24 pure vacancies on 9th September, 1967\r\n\r\n-  that was the date on which the results of the last\r\n\r\npromotion  exercise of principals of primary  schools\r\n\r\nwere  announced.  All  these 24 pure  vacancies  were\r\n\r\nfilled  by officers in a substantive capacity without\r\n\r\na period of probation. However, in that exercise, the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission also selected some officers\r\n\r\nfor appointment as acting principals for a period  of\r\n\r\none   year  or  until  the  incumbents  resume  duty,\r\n\r\nwhichever  is  the earlier. This is unavoidable.  The\r\n\r\nselected officers are not filling pure vacancies,  as\r\n\r\nthe  substantive incumbents are away on  scholarships\r\n\r\nor are either acting or officiating in higher posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be possible to consider these acting\r\n\r\nprincipals  for  promotion in a substantive  capacity\r\n\r\nonly  when a promotion exercise is conducted to  fill\r\n\r\nthe vacancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah raised certain matters\r\n\r\nregarding the salaries of teachers and principals.  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  is  aware  that  the  whole  question   of\r\n\r\nteachers' salaries, post allowances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  principals and so on is a very complicated  one.\r\n\r\nIt  dates  back  almost 20 years. The problem  is  so\r\n\r\ncomplicated  that the Harvey Salaries Commission  was\r\n\r\nafraid  to  delve  into the whole question.  It  has,\r\n\r\ntherefore, suggested a separate commission to go into\r\n\r\nthe  matter in detail. I do not think it is  possible\r\n\r\nfor  me  to  give  an  offhand  answer,  because  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry is not the sole employer  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  There is such a person as the  Exchequer\r\n\r\nor  the Minister for Finance who is in charge of  the\r\n\r\nfinances of the state. Until I have sought the  views\r\n\r\nof the Finance Minister on whether there should be  a\r\n\r\nseparate commission to go into the whole question  of\r\n\r\nthe salaries of teachers and principals, I am not  in\r\n\r\na  position  to  give a satisfactory  answer  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Blangah. I agree with him  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  the  Ministry's  view that  there  should  be  a\r\n\r\nseparate  salary scale - call it a promotion  scale\r\n\r\nif you like - for principals and that there should be\r\n\r\nfull-time assistant principals instead of the present\r\n\r\nsenior assistants. These views were submitted to  the\r\n\r\nHarvey Salaries Commission but no firm recommendation\r\n\r\nwas  made. As I said just now, until I have consulted\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance, I am not in a position  to\r\n\r\ngive a positive answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Serangoon Gardens  brought  up  the\r\n\r\nquestion of getting the principals to make a  greater\r\n\r\ncontribution  towards  their  professional  work   in\r\n\r\neducation.  I agree with him in principle  that  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion is highly desirable. But my fear was  well\r\n\r\nfounded,  as  has  been  proved  just  now   by   the\r\n\r\nMinister's  reply. The Minister said that he  readily\r\n\r\nagreed  to such a suggestion and that he would follow\r\n\r\nit  up. However, at this juncture the principals will\r\n\r\nbe  asked again to do something which I think is quite\r\n\r\nbeyond  them.  I  may  have to  repeat  what  I  said\r\n\r\nyesterday   about   the  question   of   over-loading\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  teachers with unprofessional  duties\r\n\r\nwith  the  result that they are unable to  contribute\r\n\r\nvery significantly to their professional work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of principals making a contribution\r\n\r\ntowards  educational matters, I do not want to  sound\r\n\r\ntoo professional here. But I would like to quote just\r\n\r\none  example  of  teachers  in  other  countries.  In\r\n\r\nAmerica,  for  example, after a number  of  years  of\r\n\r\nservice,  teachers  are given six  months'  full-pay,\r\n\r\nwhat  they call Sabbatical leave. The purpose  is  to\r\n\r\nenable  them to go to other countries and  study  for\r\n\r\nthemselves the educational system there and  also  do\r\n\r\nsome research work. I am not making a comparison  and\r\n\r\nsaying  that we should do likewise. The point I  want\r\n\r\nto stress is this. For professional people to be able\r\n\r\nto   make   a  substantial  contribution   to   their\r\n\r\nprofessional work, the one essential element  is  the\r\n\r\ntime  factor. There should be opportunities for these\r\n\r\npeople  to  have  the time to study and  do  research\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of teachers, they should also be given\r\n\r\ntime to travel and see things for themselves and make\r\n\r\ncomparisons  with different educational  systems.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  I  think the Minister knows the  answer.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore it is quite difficult for teachers  to  get\r\n\r\nthis  sort  of  leave,  more so  for  principals.  At\r\n\r\npresent,  the principals are less fortunate than  the\r\n\r\nteachers.  Although teachers are supposed  to  get  a\r\n\r\nthree-term holiday, they are expected to go to school\r\n\r\nand do a lot of things. But principals have got to be\r\n\r\nin school even during the holidays to carry out their\r\n\r\nduties.  The  question of leave  for  principals  has\r\n\r\nnever  been  settled.  I am not  here  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nquestion of the conditions of service of teachers.  I\r\n\r\njust  want  to point out to the Member for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens this one obstacle which principals will  have\r\n\r\nto   encounter   before  they  can  carry   out   his\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also to understand that the nature of the\r\n\r\nduties  and  the  type  of  responsibilities  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipals have considerably increased since the last\r\n\r\ndecade.  As the Member for Telok Blangah has  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  a  principal now has to look after two schools.\r\n\r\nDue  to the shortage of school buildings, two schools\r\n\r\nare being run under one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding.  Now  very conveniently  the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\ncalled  them two sessions of one school~ But when  we\r\n\r\ncompare   the  structure  of  the  schools   in   our\r\n\r\nneighbour,  Malaysia, with our own, we  are  in  fact\r\n\r\nhaving  two  schools  in  one  school  building.  The\r\n\r\nprincipal's responsibility is to look after these two\r\n\r\nschools. This is one additional responsibility  which\r\n\r\nhe has had to undertake since the last decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said yesterday, we have made significant and\r\n\r\nimpressive  progress in our educational  development.\r\n\r\nWe  have  introduced integrated schools. At one  time\r\n\r\nprincipals  had  to  look after only  one  stream  of\r\n\r\neducation.  Now they have to look after two  or  even\r\n\r\nsometimes  three streams of education. It is  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch  the size or the number of classes as the nature\r\n\r\nof  the  responsibility  that  is  the  problem.  The\r\n\r\neducational   system  i'n  the  Chinese   stream   is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  that  in the English  stream.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the timetables for the two different streams\r\n\r\nof education, with all the attendant problems arising\r\n\r\nfrom integration, have to be fitted in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to integration, we now have the multi-\r\n\r\npurpose  school,  which  is a sort  of  comprehensive\r\n\r\nschool. If you talk about comprehensive education  in\r\n\r\nEngland, and compare it with the type of schools that\r\n\r\nwe  have, the strength of their staff would be two or\r\n\r\nthree times greater than that of our schools. As  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has said, Singapore is an island\r\n\r\nof  224  square miles at low tide. We  are  short  of\r\n\r\nland. Therefore, school buildings have to go upwards.\r\n\r\nI  believe  that in some of the schools in  Singapore\r\n\r\nthey  have  as many as 48 classrooms in  one  school.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  playing field. These are some  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems  which  have come within the  responsibility\r\n\r\nand duties of principals in the past few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned yesterday the lack of co-operation\r\n\r\non the part of parents. Not only do they not show any\r\n\r\nspecial  interest  in  their  children's  welfare  in\r\n\r\neducation,  but  sometimes  they  even  obstruct  the\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers in the performance  of  their\r\n\r\nduties. One\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery common occurrence these days is for the children\r\n\r\nto complain to their parents on the slightest excuse.\r\n\r\nThese  complaints are readily accepted,  and  at  one\r\n\r\ntime  almost  welcomed, by the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nand  an immediate investigation would then be carried\r\n\r\nout.  The poor principals and teachers would have  to\r\n\r\nanswer all these complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the types of problems which principals and\r\n\r\nteachers  have  to worry about and attend  to.  After\r\n\r\ngrappling with them, I wonder how they can  have  the\r\n\r\nmental  capacity, if at all they have  the  time,  to\r\n\r\nmake  any  significant contribution towards improving\r\n\r\ntheir  professional work. Nevertheless, some  efforts\r\n\r\nhave  been made towards this end. I can only say that\r\n\r\nfrom  my  association  with the  Singapore  Teachers'\r\n\r\nUnion,  some  modest efforts have been  made  towards\r\n\r\nprofessional improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives from principals and teachers have\r\n\r\nmet  together and have drawn up a code of ethics.  We\r\n\r\nhave  occasionally  produced journals  in  connection\r\n\r\nwith  our  profession. We have also  met  to  discuss\r\n\r\nmatters of professional interest. We have on numerous\r\n\r\noccasions  made representations to the  Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  officials on matters  of  professional\r\n\r\ninterest.  The  Education  Ministry  did  organise  a\r\n\r\nseminar for principals. The Singapore Teachers' Union\r\n\r\nalso  made  an  effort to follow up that  seminar  by\r\n\r\noffering  to organise seminars for teachers. However,\r\n\r\nwe  were told that the Education Ministry itself  was\r\n\r\nfollowing this up with further seminars for teachers.\r\n\r\nI  must say that the Education Ministry has, in fact,\r\n\r\norganised  refresher courses and re-training  courses\r\n\r\nfor teachers. I think the teachers are today spending\r\n\r\na  great  deal  of their time outside teaching  hours\r\n\r\ntrying  to  improve  themselves  by  attending  these\r\n\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I have much to say at this juncture.\r\n\r\nI  am  not really trying to be too pessimistic  about\r\n\r\nthe contributions from principals and teachers. I can\r\n\r\nconfidently say that the teachers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould   be   more   than  willing   to   make   their\r\n\r\ncontribution,  not only by spending  extra  hours  in\r\n\r\nteaching or taking part in extramural activities, but\r\n\r\nalso  in  producing papers on matters of professional\r\n\r\ninterest  to  education. But  like  people  in  other\r\n\r\nprofessions,  principals and teachers need  one  very\r\n\r\nimportant  element  if they are to  make  any  contri\r\n\r\nbution towards their profession, and that is peace of\r\n\r\nmind.  There  should be less interruptions  in  their\r\n\r\nprofessional  duties.  They  should  be   given   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to do research work and thus  make  their\r\n\r\ncontribution in the field of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot agree\r\n\r\nmore  with  the Member for Moulmein when he suggested\r\n\r\nthat  principals  should  be given  periodically  six\r\n\r\nmonths'  full-pay  Sabbatical  leave,  provided,   of\r\n\r\ncourse, we have the necessary financial resources  to\r\n\r\ndo  so.  I  am sure the Ministers on this side,  too,\r\n\r\nwould  like  to have six months' full-pay  Sabbatical\r\n\r\nleave. However, I think the Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nhas  a  number of scholarships and fellowships  which\r\n\r\nare available annually to anyone who is interested in\r\n\r\nfurther studies abroad. I am quite prepared to  grant\r\n\r\nliberally  no-pay leave to any principal  or  teacher\r\n\r\nwho  likes to advance his knowledge abroad, provided,\r\n\r\nas I said, it is no pay leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that, as a result of running two sessions\r\n\r\nwith one principal, the promotion opportunities for a\r\n\r\nlarge   number   of  teachers  have   been   somewhat\r\n\r\nrestricted.  While  we  cannot  afford  to  have  one\r\n\r\nprincipal for one session, I think it is possible  to\r\n\r\nconsider a principal for one session and an assistant\r\n\r\nprincipal  for the other session in the same  school.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  compromise proposal which  I  thought  was\r\n\r\nfeasible and that is why the suggestion was  made  to\r\n\r\nthe  Harvey  Salaries  Commission.  I  am  not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition, at the moment, to give a positive reply  on\r\n\r\nthis  matter. But if the time is appropriate, I  will\r\n\r\ntake up this matter again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1157.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek your leave to range over the subject\r\n\r\narising  out  of  subhead 1159 as  well  -  amendment\r\n\r\n(15)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Amendment(15) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\tThat the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1159.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, in as much as it takes two to do\r\n\r\nthe   tango   gracefully,  it  takes   the   teaching\r\n\r\nprofession  and  the administration  in  a  huge  co-\r\n\r\nordinated  exercise to make our new education  system\r\n\r\nsucceed.  I  have previously spoken of the  responses\r\n\r\nfrom  the administration which are necessary,  and  I\r\n\r\nnow  wish  to speak of the responses which. I  think,\r\n\r\nare required from the teachers. Generally speaking, I\r\n\r\nbelieve   the  teachers  attempt  their  best   under\r\n\r\nreasonably  harsh conditions, having to contend  with\r\n\r\nexcessively  large  classes, a voluminous  curriculum\r\n\r\nand extensive extracurricular activities ranging from\r\n\r\nart  clubs to volley ball. No doubt the duties of the\r\n\r\nteachers today are onerous. But there is, however,  a\r\n\r\nsmall  negligible segment of the profession  to  whom\r\n\r\nthe  profession  has lost all appeal, whose  teaching\r\n\r\nresponsiveness  has long atrophied into  the  callous\r\n\r\nprinciple of doing the least for the maximum benefit.\r\n\r\nI  must speak out against this segment of teachers. I\r\n\r\nthink they had better make up their minds whether  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  or  out of the profession, and they would  be\r\n\r\nsparing  themselves  if  they  left  the  profession,\r\n\r\nbecause  I do not think one can be half committed  if\r\n\r\none is in the teaching profession. One either teaches\r\n\r\nor  one  misteaches,  and we certainly  do  not  want\r\n\r\nteachers who misteach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move into the next decade and after having\r\n\r\ngone  through a series of educational changes in  the\r\n\r\nprevious one and having finally set our system, there\r\n\r\nis  need  for  the teachers today to  assimilate  the\r\n\r\ntrend and the progress of the times in the country if\r\n\r\nthey are to contribute their utmost. At this stage of\r\n\r\nour educational development, Sir, we need - as I have\r\n\r\nsaid  before  and I do not think this  can  be  over-emphasised a positive awakening of teaching power. We\r\n\r\nneed  a  tremendous  teaching zeal,  founded  upon  a\r\n\r\nprecise  understanding of the aims  and  purposes  of\r\n\r\neducation in the context of our national growth.  And\r\n\r\nwhat is supremely important, a vocation to teach.  It\r\n\r\nmeans  that the teachers need continually to  improve\r\n\r\nupon   their  own  capability  by  perusing  material\r\n\r\nrelevant   to  the  profession  and  thinking   about\r\n\r\nproblems relating to education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, it was suggested to me that one\r\n\r\nindictment against the teaching profession is that  a\r\n\r\njournal  called  the Teachers World Today  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsold  in Singapore for want of purchasers. It may  be\r\n\r\nso.  I  remember some years ago when the  agents  for\r\n\r\nthis periodical made quite a business. But it appears\r\n\r\nthat they have relinquished their agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There can be no half-way measures in teaching and it\r\n\r\nis  imperative  that teachers today be conscious  all\r\n\r\nthe  time of the fact that they are teaching, because\r\n\r\nif  they  are  not,  as I elaborated  yesterday,  the\r\n\r\ndanger  of  falling  into the rut of  instructing  is\r\n\r\nalways present. Theirs is a difficult task of finding\r\n\r\nthe  time  and  the opportunity, in addition  to  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  to  educate their pupils for  character,\r\n\r\nfor  social cohesion, for citizenship, for democratic\r\n\r\nliving,  for  critical  inquiry,  for  respect,   for\r\n\r\ndignity  in work, for racial and religious tolerance,\r\n\r\nfor   community   development  and  for   intelligent\r\n\r\nleisure. They must undertake all these if we  are  to\r\n\r\nhave educated school-leavers. Such needs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrequire teachers to involve their professional selves\r\n\r\nwith  the aspirations of the country and fully commit\r\n\r\ntheir professional expertise to the aims and purposes\r\n\r\nof education today. For the sake of our country, Sir,\r\n\r\nI   call   for  these  responses  from  the  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  calls  for a reply from me, because  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  anyone  will  disagree  with  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens on what a teacher should be. I must\r\n\r\nadmit there are not many teachers who can measure  up\r\n\r\nto  his expectations. It is mainly the result of  the\r\n\r\nlarge and rapid expansion in education over the  last\r\n\r\nten  years. Many of the existing teachers who  should\r\n\r\nnot,  in fact, be teachers have got into the teaching\r\n\r\nprofession   due  to  the  lack  of   more   suitable\r\n\r\ncandidates.  I think the problem is how  to  identify\r\n\r\nthose   teachers   who  are  indifferent   to   their\r\n\r\nprofession  and  to take appropriate  action  against\r\n\r\nthem.  I  have been in the Ministry of Education  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  four years and I have yet to come  across\r\n\r\nany  principal  who is prepared to inform  me  or  my\r\n\r\nDirector  that such and such a teacher in his  school\r\n\r\nshould  not  remain in the service  but  should  seek\r\n\r\nalternative  employment elsewhere. Therefore,  it  is\r\n\r\nvery difficult for the officials in the Ministry  and\r\n\r\nfor me to identify this small category of black sheep\r\n\r\nin the teaching profession and weed them out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

But the\r\n\r\nproblem is how to apply that ideal in the Singapore\r\n\r\nsituation. I also agree with the Minister who has\r\n\r\nsaid that there are black sheep among the teachers,\r\n\r\nbut that the problem is how to spot them out. Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, there are also many teachers who  want\r\n\r\nto play their role but who face certain difficulties.\r\n\r\nTo   be   good   teachers,  there  must  be   certain\r\n\r\nenvironmental conditions favourable for the  teachers\r\n\r\nto  carry  out  their  responsibilities.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier, in certain schools  they  do  not\r\n\r\neven  have a field for teachers to train students  to\r\n\r\nbe  more  rugged. There is the problem of  getting  a\r\n\r\nproper  field  and facilities for physical  education\r\n\r\nexercises.  There are a host of other problems,  such\r\n\r\nas teachers getting transferred every so often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to enlighten the Minister on why no\r\n\r\nprincipals would bring to his notice or to the notice\r\n\r\nof  his  officials certain cases of bad  teachers,  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is  the position and  I  will  quote  an\r\n\r\nexample which is causing this situation. There  is  a\r\n\r\nprincipal who is very energetic and keen to see  that\r\n\r\nthe  educational standard in his school is maintained\r\n\r\nand  that the teachers maintain certain standards  of\r\n\r\nprofessional proficiency and conducts. One teacher in\r\n\r\nhis  school persistently misbehaved himself  and  the\r\n\r\nprincipal brought up the matter with the inspector of\r\n\r\nschools concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a series of investigations, but finally\r\n\r\nit  appears that the principal was not doing his  job\r\n\r\nbecause he did not fulfil certain requirements.  This\r\n\r\nnews passed around, resulting in a feeling among  the\r\n\r\nprincipals that they should not try to overdo  things\r\n\r\nbecause, instead of putting things right, they  would\r\n\r\nfind themselves in serious trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment  but  I  will  not  allow  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein to dilute the cogency of my ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The domestic science teacher, as I see her,\r\n\r\nis  one  who, apart from teaching her pupils  cookery\r\n\r\nand   sewing,  should  also  be  teaching  them  home\r\n\r\neconomics. In addition, there is a need to  introduce\r\n\r\nto  these  pupils  subjects  like  the  rudiments  of\r\n\r\nsociology,  the structure of society, the family  and\r\n\r\nthe  individual,  parental  responsibilities  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily to society and the country, factors and habits\r\n\r\nwhich  disintegrate the family and how to  avoid  and\r\n\r\ncorrect  them. I think these are subjects  which  the\r\n\r\npupils  studying  domestic science ought  to  concern\r\n\r\nthemselves with, apart from cookery and sewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I observe with some anxiety the ease\r\n\r\nwith which family cohesion today in our society tends\r\n\r\nto  dissolve  as we proceed towards urbanisation.  My\r\n\r\nimpression  today  is  that the  ordinary  hawker  is\r\n\r\nalready becoming so much an integral feature  of  our\r\n\r\nlife  that  for many families, lunch or dinner  would\r\n\r\nmean the mother or father giving 30 cents or 40 cents\r\n\r\nto their children who would disperse for their choice\r\n\r\nmeals. There are no longer opportunities to cohere in\r\n\r\nthe  family.  I think these are tendencies  which  we\r\n\r\nought  to try to avert now, and the domestic  science\r\n\r\nteachers  can  start doing that by instructing  their\r\n\r\npupils in all these subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister enlighten the House on whether the\r\n\r\nofficer  in  charge of syllabuses is  aware  of  such\r\n\r\ntendencies and whether or not there is an attempt  or\r\n\r\na  trend  to  embody  these  subjects  which  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned in the curriculum for domestic science?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the syllabuses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  under  constant review.

Of course, the Member is also aware  of  my\r\n\r\nMinister's  speech on 12th December,  1968,  that  as\r\n\r\nfrom next year domestic science will be compulsory to\r\n\r\nall secondary female students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Inche\r\n\r\nMohd.

In other words, our efforts must not  only\r\n\r\nbe  directed at quantitative improvement but also  at\r\n\r\nqualitative    improvement   in    our    educational\r\n\r\nendeavours.  Judging from the courses and re-training\r\n\r\nconducted by the Teachers' Training College, it seems\r\n\r\nthat  the  question  of  quantity  has  been  solved,\r\n\r\nparticularly in regard to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprimary school teachers. What is urgently required at\r\n\r\nthe present juncture is sufficient technical teachers\r\n\r\nto man our technical and vocational schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th December, the Minister for Education said in\r\n\r\nthis House and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To provide the necessary teachers for the swing\r\n\r\ntowards  technical education, a massive training  and\r\n\r\nretraining scheme is already under way. The  training\r\n\r\nprogramme will move into top gear next year with  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  the  technical wing of  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is really a very heartening move on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry. But, on the other hand,  we  must  not\r\n\r\nforget   that  we  should  also  aim  at  qualitative\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  our  education.  The  retraining  of\r\n\r\nqualified  teachers, viewed from certain  angles,  is\r\n\r\naimed at enhancing the quality of teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to say a few words on the re-training\r\n\r\nprogramme and the attitude of the teachers towards re\r\n\r\ntraining.  Care should be exercised in  making  long-\r\n\r\nterm  plans for such re-training courses. Let me take\r\n\r\nas  an  example the syllabus of Chinese as  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage,  which  is  one of the  important  training\r\n\r\ncourses, the success of teaching Chinese as a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage, and the policy of bilingualism in  schools.\r\n\r\nWhat  preparations have been made  by  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College or the Ministry before these courses\r\n\r\nare  conducted? How many experts are  there  in  this\r\n\r\nparticular  field?  How are we  going  to  train  the\r\n\r\nlecturers  who  will in turn train  the  teachers  to\r\n\r\nteach  Chinese  as a second language  in  non-Chinese\r\n\r\nschools? There are many teachers who want to  improve\r\n\r\nthemselves and are willing to learn, but whether they\r\n\r\nhave adopted the correct attitude is questionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago some lucrative monetary incentives\r\n\r\nwere  given  to  those attending  certain  in-service\r\n\r\ncourses. However, such monetary incentives have  been\r\n\r\nabolished  and  yet the response to  the  re-training\r\n\r\ncourses has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  very  good.  I can give two reasons  for  this.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the reason for the good response shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  are eager to learn and want  to  equip\r\n\r\nthemselves with the latest methods so that  they  can\r\n\r\naccept   the   challenge  of   educating   our   next\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the negative sense, this shows that our\r\n\r\nteachers  want  to  safeguard their  jobs.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  they  want  to  protect their  rice-bowl.  Un\r\n\r\nfortunately, most of those teachers who responded  to\r\n\r\nthe re-training courses were motivated by the need or\r\n\r\nanxiety to secure their employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad to note that the majority of teachers\r\n\r\nregard teaching as an ordinary profession and not  as\r\n\r\na  special profession. I am a teacher and I can there\r\n\r\nfore  speak  from my own experience. I will  describe\r\n\r\nbriefly   the   actual  position  in   the   schools,\r\n\r\nespecially  with  regard to the attitude  of  certain\r\n\r\nteachers to the teaching profession. They are  scared\r\n\r\nof  their colleagues. They fear that their colleagues\r\n\r\nmay  make  reports  to the principals  and  that  the\r\n\r\nprincipals in turn will make adverse reports  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Many  teachers  are  also  scared  of  the\r\n\r\ninspectors and officials from the Ministry. This goes\r\n\r\nto  show  that  the relationship among the  teachers,\r\n\r\nprincipals and officials of the Ministry  is  one  of\r\n\r\nmutual  distrust and suspicion, with the result  that\r\n\r\nthe  teachers  are content to do only what  they  are\r\n\r\nrequired to do. They regard their jobs as a means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood  and  they  do  not  display  professional\r\n\r\nethics in their work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the Teachers' Training College\r\n\r\nwhich  plays  an important role in teacher  training.\r\n\r\nTeacher training should not be undertaken by the  Tea\r\n\r\nchers'   Training  College  alone.  The   inspectors.\r\n\r\nprincipals and senior teachers also have  a  role  to\r\n\r\nplay  in  teacher training. Of course, the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining  College  is  directly  involved  with   the\r\n\r\ntraining of teachers. The curriculum of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Teachers'  Training College is composed  of  two\r\n\r\nsections, namely, professional subjects and  academic\r\n\r\nsubjects.  The professional subjects are  educational\r\n\r\ntheory, educational psychology and other methods  of\r\n\r\nteaching,  and  the  academic  subjects  are   mainly\r\n\r\nconcerned with the contents of the academic subjects.\r\n\r\nThe   trainees  are  mostly  from  the  primary   and\r\n\r\nsecondary schools. It is regrettable that not  enough\r\n\r\nhas  been done to instil professional ethics into the\r\n\r\nteachers. I feel that the Teachers' Training  College\r\n\r\nshould lay more stress on professional ethics courses\r\n\r\nfor  the  teachers. It should also  provide  training\r\n\r\ncourses    in    school    administration.     School\r\n\r\nadministration is one of the subjects taught  in  the\r\n\r\nuniversities.  In this way, we hope to have  teachers\r\n\r\nof   good   quality   and  learned  principals   with\r\n\r\nadministrative  skill. Of course, it is  not  exactly\r\n\r\nthe  intention  that  teachers  should  learn  school\r\n\r\nadministration  with a view to their being  appointed\r\n\r\nas  principals, but it is the duty of the teachers to\r\n\r\nhave  an  inkling of school administration.  If  they\r\n\r\nhave  a basic knowledge of school administration,  it\r\n\r\nis  possible that they can become principals  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  and put their knowledge to good use.  But  if\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  start  from  scratch  when  they  are\r\n\r\nappointed as principals, they will find themselves in\r\n\r\na mess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to refer to kindergarten\r\n\r\neducation.  Children  in  kindergarten  classes   can\r\n\r\neasily cultivate attitudes and habits. Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nshould  pay much attention to their social  behaviour\r\n\r\nand  physical  health in order to  prepare  them  for\r\n\r\nacademic  studies  in  later  years.  Formal  lessons\r\n\r\nshould   not  be  conducted  in  kindergartens.   The\r\n\r\nchildren  should enjoy indoor and outdoor  activities\r\n\r\nin  pleasant  surroundings. They should  be  provided\r\n\r\nwith  toys and play-things. In addition, they  should\r\n\r\nbe   taught  educative  and  creative  subjects  like\r\n\r\ndrawing, story-telling, singing and dancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng)</b>: Mr Tay, I am\r\n\r\nafraid your 15 minutes are up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, perhaps I can begin my\r\n\r\nobservations  by asking what the schemes  of  teacher\r\n\r\ntraining  are which are currently being conducted  in\r\n\r\nthe Teachers' Training College today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality teaching comes from quality teachers, and\r\n\r\nquality  teachers  are  found and  developed  in  the\r\n\r\nTeachers'  Training College. This brings  me  to  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of selection for teacher training these  days.\r\n\r\nFor years now, teacher training selection has been on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of academic merits which has been accepted\r\n\r\nas  an indicator of suitability for the teaching  pro\r\n\r\nfession.  This  has  been necessary  because  of  the\r\n\r\nexigencies of the times which have demanded  a  rapid\r\n\r\nexpansion in education. Today, however, we  begin  to\r\n\r\nemphasise  \"qualitative\"  education  which,   in   my\r\n\r\nopinion,  is  a  supertlous  adjective,  because   if\r\n\r\neducation   is  education,  then  it  is  qualitative\r\n\r\nalready, if it is not, it is mis-education. But if we\r\n\r\nare to initiate a qualitative revolution in education\r\n\r\nnow,  I  suggest  that  we  start  in  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining  College  and  we re-do  the  basis  of  our\r\n\r\nteacher training selection in order that we may recog\r\n\r\nnise  teaching as a vocation, although that  vocation\r\n\r\nmay  repose  in the bosom of an applicant without  an\r\n\r\nimpressive academic achievement. The inquiry into the\r\n\r\nselection  of  applicants  should  be  of  sufficient\r\n\r\nbreadth and depth. It should probe for some signs  of\r\n\r\nan  impulsion  to  teach. Then it should  survey  the\r\n\r\napplicant's character and look for what I would  call\r\n\r\nthe intangibles - the undefinable traits which go  to\r\n\r\nmake up the character of the individual - not so much\r\n\r\nby  a  reference to the conduct columns in  a  school\r\n\r\nreport  book,  but by ranging over the  intellectual,\r\n\r\nsocial and cultural experiences of the applicant  and\r\n\r\nthe moral or immoral persuasions to which he had been\r\n\r\nsubjected in his childhood or adolescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was when applicants for the teaching profession\r\n\r\ncame from middle-class homes. That practice no longer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nobtains  today - and I say this without any intention\r\n\r\nof  casting a reflection on, any one class. But  they\r\n\r\ndid have a certain amount of moral upbringing imposed\r\n\r\nupon  them  by conservative parents, with the  result\r\n\r\nthat  when they recruited for the teaching profession\r\n\r\nthey had in them what could be termed a moral content\r\n\r\nand they were, therefore, suitable to appear before a\r\n\r\nclass  of  40 students to teach. But after  the  war,\r\n\r\neducation was brought to the people at large so  that\r\n\r\nwe  gradually got the person who appeared before  the\r\n\r\nselection   board   with   the   requisite   academic\r\n\r\nqualifications.  But  I maintain  that  that  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficient alone to qualify him, to appear  before  a\r\n\r\nclass  of  40 students to teach. I think the  inquiry\r\n\r\nshould  go beyond that. As I have said, it should  go\r\n\r\ninto all the moral persuasions that go to make up his\r\n\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of boys and girls will pass through the\r\n\r\ninfluence of teachers. These teachers cannot and will\r\n\r\nnot  teach no matter how intelligent they are if they\r\n\r\nare  amoral;  they can only instruct. In that  light,\r\n\r\nwhat   are  the  content  courses  in  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining  College  today?  Are  they  courses   which\r\n\r\ninstruct  and  equip student teachers  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nteaching for social cohesion? One innovation which  I\r\n\r\nmay  suggest  is that the Teachers' Training  College\r\n\r\nmay  consider  courses to instruct  trainees  in  the\r\n\r\nmechanics  of  learning, so that they  may  not  only\r\n\r\nteach  the  teachers what to learn but how  to  learn\r\n\r\neffectively.  I  wonder what is the  extent  of  such\r\n\r\ntraining  in  the Teachers' Training College  in  the\r\n\r\ncomplexities of present-day living. I think a student\r\n\r\nhas to go through quite a lot of reading material  in\r\n\r\none  day, and if he is a slow reader, he is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  greatly  handicapped. I refer  to  subjects  like\r\n\r\nspeed reading and comprehension. I wonder what is the\r\n\r\nextent  of  such  training in the Teachers'  Training\r\n\r\nCollege. There is so much for the pupils to  take  in\r\n\r\nand absorb in the course of their school life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it should be obvious that one way of going\r\n\r\nabout it is to teach them \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhow  to  absorb  the material read  effectively.

But\r\n\r\nI  wish  to express one regret about this volume  and\r\n\r\nits  contents.  The views and opinions  on  education\r\n\r\nexpressed  in  this journal are excluded  from  being\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the College or the thinking of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  They are impressive articles by impressive\r\n\r\nwriters.  But, at the same time, paragraph 2  on  the\r\n\r\nsecond  page  says, \"Any opinions which  the  writers\r\n\r\nhave expressed or implied in this publication do  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  reflect the views of the College  or  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think we need - at least I for one need - to\r\n\r\nbe  able to assist the Minister and his Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary is to have articles on education which  are\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the views of the Ministry  and  the T.T.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much of what\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Paya Lebar said just  now,  has,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   already  been  covered  by  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens.  The Member  for  Paya  Lebar  is\r\n\r\ndoubtful  about the benefit of many of the in-service\r\n\r\ncourses organised by the Ministry. In his view,  many\r\n\r\nof  the  teachers  who responded to these  in-service\r\n\r\ncourses  either did so because of the  attraction  of\r\n\r\nthe  increment in the salary scale, or  because  they\r\n\r\nwanted  to ensure their security of tenure. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey  had  very  little interest  in  the  in-service\r\n\r\ncourses.  One  can  only hope that the  teachers  who\r\n\r\nattended many of the in-service courses organised for\r\n\r\nthem  are genuinely interested in the profession  and\r\n\r\nwant to improve themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also suggested that school administration\r\n\r\nshould be one of  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   subjects  taught  in  the  Teachers'   Training\r\n\r\nCollege,  in  addition to the professional  subjects.\r\n\r\nThere  is nothing objectionable to this in principle.\r\n\r\nBut  I  am  not  so  sure whether  time  permits  the\r\n\r\ninclusion of this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the kindergarten classes are concerned,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry does not have the financial resources to\r\n\r\nsupervise this aspect of the child's education. It is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly desirable if we have the financial  means\r\n\r\nto  run  the kindergarten classes ourselves. However,\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Ministry seeks to do is to  draw  up  some\r\n\r\nguidance  for  the  organisers  of  the  kindergarten\r\n\r\nclasses.  In  conjunction with  the  Adult  Education\r\n\r\nBoard,  the Ministry is now organising a kindergarten\r\n\r\nteachers'  course  for  principals  and  teachers  of\r\n\r\nexisting   registered   kindergarten   schools.    In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  Adult  Education  Board,   with   the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  the  Education  Ministry,  will  also\r\n\r\norganise  a  crash  programme  for  the  training  of\r\n\r\nteachers  in  kindergarten classes organised  by  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association and other interested parties. It\r\n\r\nis  our  view that trained kindergarten teachers  are\r\n\r\nbetter  than  the  untrained  teachers  who  are  now\r\n\r\nconducting  these classes. As far as the Ministry  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, the cost of running these classes will not\r\n\r\nbe prohibitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has raised the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the selection of candidates for training\r\n\r\nas  teachers. He says that proper care should be exer\r\n\r\ncised  in  their  selection.  As  he  is  aware,  all\r\n\r\nteachers  in  training were selected  by  the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission. I am sure they would have  taken\r\n\r\nall  the  relevant  factors into  consideration  when\r\n\r\nselecting candidates for the teaching service. It  is\r\n\r\ntrue that because of the rapid expansion and the need\r\n\r\nfor large numbers of teachers, it has not always been\r\n\r\npossible  to  pay  due regard to factors  other  than\r\n\r\nacademic  performances. However, the expansion  phase\r\n\r\nin  education is now over. Henceforth, I think it  is\r\n\r\npossible  to  pay  regard  to  what  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens has referred to as the  intangible\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T.T.C. is only responsible for the selection of\r\n\r\nstudents  for  full-time teacher  training.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,   the  following  factors  are  taken   into\r\n\r\naccount:\r\n\r\nacademic  qualifications, extracurricular activities,\r\n\r\nspoken language, including a test in oral reading and\r\n\r\ncomprehension, personality, aptitude and general know\r\n\r\nledge.  In  so far as full-time teacher  training  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  academic qualifications,  therefore,  are\r\n\r\nnot  the sole criterion for selection of students  by\r\n\r\nthe T.T.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention has been made that in the past teachers were\r\n\r\nrecruited  mainly  from middle class  families,  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they had a higher moral standing. I am not\r\n\r\nso sure that this was necessarily the case. I think a\r\n\r\nfairly large proportion of families in the middle and\r\n\r\nwell-to-do  classes did not measure up  to  the  high\r\n\r\nmoral  standards expected of them. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nthere  are,  from the working class families,  people\r\n\r\nwith  moral  fibre comparable to, if not even  better\r\n\r\nthan,  those from the middle class families. However,\r\n\r\nI  agree  with the Member that now that the expansion\r\n\r\nphase is over, more attention should be paid to  such\r\n\r\nintangible  factors  as  the  character   and   moral\r\n\r\nstandards of the candidates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am quite satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister's explanation.

It also conducts  courses\r\n\r\nin orchid growing, photography and so on. The biggest\r\n\r\ncontribution  by  the  Adult Education  Board  is  to\r\n\r\naccommodate students who fail in the Cambridge School\r\n\r\nCertificate  Examination, the  Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nCertificate   Examination,  or   the   Secondary   IV\r\n\r\nexamination.

The Member is quite right in  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  activities of the Board will be  increased\r\n\r\nnext  year.  In  fact, there are many projects  which\r\n\r\nwill be implemented next year. Unfortunately, in view\r\n\r\nof  the increased defence expenditure, economy has to\r\n\r\nbe practised in many items of social expenditure, and\r\n\r\nthe  Adult Education Board is one of those which will\r\n\r\nbe  affected adversely.

However,  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  the Member that the services provided by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  will not be affected by this decrease  in  the\r\n\r\nvote.  This  will  be met partly by  a  reduction  in\r\n\r\nremuneration to part-time teachers and, in  part,  by\r\n\r\nan upward revision of some of the fees chargeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Malay students who are Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens or children of Singapore citizens, they will\r\n\r\nbe  granted a concession in that they need  only  pay\r\n\r\nhalf the rate of tuition fees, and for those who  are\r\n\r\nattending  special classes, they will be granted  the\r\n\r\nsame exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

I understand there is an extensive scheme\r\n\r\nfor  free textbooks and stationery for pupils. Is the\r\n\r\nofficer in charge of school textbooks in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Education   also  concerned  with   the   school\r\n\r\ncurriculum?  If so, to what extent, if  any,  is  the\r\n\r\naccumulation of free textbooks and their availability\r\n\r\nto  the schools a factor which determines changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  curriculum of schools? In fact, in view  of  the\r\n\r\nstringent  budget of the Ministry of  Education,  one\r\n\r\nmight  be  tempted to say that one  has  got  a  vast\r\n\r\naccumulation of old textbooks so one will not  change\r\n\r\none's  curriculum and therefore make use of  the  old\r\n\r\nfree  textbooks,  when  perhaps  there  need  to   be\r\n\r\nprogressive tendencies in curriculum changes  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time.  May  I  know, also,  when  and  in  what\r\n\r\ncircumstances are curriculum changes made and on what\r\n\r\nbasis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what becomes of the free textbooks which\r\n\r\nare no longer required for issue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the distribution of free\r\n\r\ntextbooks   does  not  in  any  way   determine   the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  changes.  These  changes  are  determined\r\n\r\nmainly by changes in educational policy. The Ministry\r\n\r\ndoes  not  directly purchase textbooks and distribute\r\n\r\nthem  to  schools.  Each school  is  given  a  yearly\r\n\r\nallocation  of  a certain sum from the  central  free\r\n\r\ntextbooks vote, and if the allocated sum is not fully\r\n\r\nutilised  for the purchase of textbooks, the  balance\r\n\r\nis   returned  to  the  Ministry  and  re-distributed\r\n\r\namongst  other schools requiring further allocations.\r\n\r\nAs such, there is no possibility of accumulating vast\r\n\r\nstocks  of  free textbooks. When these books  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger  required, they are transferred to the  school\r\n\r\nlibraries  for  reference and  lending  purposes  and\r\n\r\nthose  which  are  too  old  and  unserviceable   are\r\n\r\ndisposed  of. Therefore, the possibility of the  free\r\n\r\ntextbooks  scheme  affecting the  curriculum  changes\r\n\r\nwill not arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation, I beg\r\n\r\nleave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr L.\r\n\r\nP.

It  has\r\n\r\nbeen subsequently extended to a few vacancies at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning   of  this  year  pending  recruitment   of\r\n\r\nteachers  and also to cover replacements for teachers\r\n\r\nwho are called up for national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifications of the relief teachers will\r\n\r\ndepend on the qualifications of the teachers for whom\r\n\r\nthey  stand  in.

The  grad\r\n\r\nuate  teachers  are  of  two types  -  the  qualified\r\n\r\nteachers   and  the  under-qualified  teachers.   The\r\n\r\nqualified teachers are those graduates with a Diploma\r\n\r\nin   Education   and   those  non-graduates   holding\r\n\r\nrecognised   teacher   qualifications.   The   under-\r\n\r\nqualified  teachers are university graduates  without\r\n\r\nteaching  qualifications or  holders  of  the  School\r\n\r\nCertificate,   Senior  Middle   III   or   Government\r\n\r\nSecondary  IV  qualifications  with  three   Credits,\r\n\r\nincluding a Credit in a language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As relief teachers are appointed as short-term\r\n\r\nreplacements for the permanent ones, their duties are\r\n\r\nidentical  with those of the permanent teachers.

What consti\r\n\r\ntute the activities of vocational guidance bodies  in\r\n\r\nthe  schools? Is vocational guidance in schools  also\r\n\r\nan attempt to recognise aptitudes for careers and pro\r\n\r\nfessions and to offer the necessary guidance?

Many Members have mentioned the quality, character and profession of the teachers. It is not because I am a teacher myself that I want to say something good about them. But, generally speaking,\r\n\r\nthey  have been called the engineers of the souls  of\r\n\r\nhuman  beings. Some people describe them as  creators\r\n\r\nof  future  society. They generally have a high  esti\r\n\r\nmation  of  teachers.  We, of  course,  as  teachers,\r\n\r\nunderstand our duties and position. We appreciate the\r\n\r\nexpectations  which the public have of us.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe majority of teachers regard teaching\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas   their  profession.  They  understand  that,   as\r\n\r\nteachers, they must have self-discipline and set good\r\n\r\nexamples to the students. They must have integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the officials of the Education\r\n\r\nMinistry.  There should be good personal relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the Ministry and the teachers. As the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon  Gardens has said, under  the  present\r\n\r\neducation system, teachers are in a passive position.\r\n\r\nThey  have to comply with the instructions issued  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education just like employees taking\r\n\r\ninstructions from their employers - in order to  safe\r\n\r\nguard  their jobs. As the Member for Paya  Lebar  has\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now, officials of the Education  Ministry\r\n\r\nare  regarded  as  important  persons.  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nitself  is  regarded as an employer. If  one  or  two\r\n\r\nteachers  err,  the whole teaching  profession  comes\r\n\r\nunder the whip of the Education Ministry. There  are,\r\n\r\nof course, black sheep in all professional bodies. We\r\n\r\nmust not blame the whole profession because of one or\r\n\r\ntwo  black  sheep. The majority of the teachers  have\r\n\r\nbeen  blamed  because  of the  misbehaviour  of  some\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Ministry recently issued orders that\r\n\r\nteachers should not go to bars, dance halls or engage\r\n\r\nin  gambling.  This would give people the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  they  generally  indulge in  these  activities.\r\n\r\nAlthough  I  am not against such orders  -  for  this\r\n\r\nwould  exercise  some disciplinary control  over  the\r\n\r\nteachers  -  it should not be done at the expense  of\r\n\r\nthe  good  reputation of the teachers in  general.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister  will deal  carefully  with  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask him how many school\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  teachers have been sacked  or  given\r\n\r\nwarnings this year because of their bad behaviour  or\r\n\r\nnegligence in their duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Jurong  should  be  aware   that   when\r\n\r\nBackbenchers  or I criticise the teachers  for  their\r\n\r\nlack\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof dedication and other shortcomings, we always refer\r\n\r\nto the minority group of teachers. We have at no time\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  whole teaching profession  and  he\r\n\r\nshould  not be unduly worried about it. But  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest   that   the  best  way  of  preserving   the\r\n\r\nrespectability   of  the  profession   is   for   the\r\n\r\nprofessional  bodies, such as the  teachers'  unions,\r\n\r\nprincipals  and  members of the teaching  profession,\r\n\r\nlike  the Member for Jurong, to single out the  black\r\n\r\nsheep  so  that  appropriate action  could  be  taken\r\n\r\nagainst  them  and so that the vast majority  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers  will  not  be  adversely  affected  by  the\r\n\r\nconduct of this small number of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong seeks certain figures about\r\n\r\nthe  number of teachers dismissed. In 1968, only  one\r\n\r\nprincipal and two teachers were dismissed because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  misconduct.  In addition,  one  principal  and\r\n\r\nseven teachers had their services terminated also  on\r\n\r\ngrounds of misconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

It is a pitiful sight  to  see\r\n\r\nyoung   children,  particularly  young  girls,   from\r\n\r\nschools  in  the rural areas waiting  for  buses  and\r\n\r\nhaving to walk in dark lonely streets after alighting\r\n\r\nfrom  a bus, sometimes as late as 7.30 p.m. Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister   consider  approaching  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommunications and requesting him to arrange  for  an\r\n\r\nadequate number of buses for school children so  that\r\n\r\nthey  do not have to wait so late at night for  their\r\n\r\nbuses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I think the provision of\r\n\r\nschool buses will help to solve this perennial\r\n\r\nproblem of a good many parents to find suitable\r\n\r\ntransport for their children who are attending school\r\n\r\nand will also relieve their anxiety for the safety of\r\n\r\ntheir children. My Ministry is already looking into\r\n\r\nthis problem and the possibility of encouraging\r\n\r\nschools to run a school bus service of their own. A\r\n\r\nnumber of Chinese schools in Singapore already have\r\n\r\nschool buses of their own to provide transportation\r\n\r\nfor their pupils. It is hoped that the example of\r\n\r\nthese Chinese schools will be followed and that\r\n\r\neventually more schools will succeed in having their\r\n\r\nown bus service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I notice there has been some reduction\r\n\r\nin  the expenditure of the Ministry of Education.  We\r\n\r\nknow  a  newly  emergent nation must  place  economy,\r\n\r\neducation and culture on an equal basis. That is  the\r\n\r\nproper way to do things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, a youth forum was conducted over\r\n\r\nT.V.  Singapura  and the topic was  whether  economic\r\n\r\nconstruction   is   more  important   than   cultural\r\n\r\nconstruction in nation building. The outcome  of  the\r\n\r\ndebate  was that cultural construction was considered\r\n\r\nto  be more important than economic construction.  So\r\n\r\nwe  can  say  that education is within the  ambit  of\r\n\r\nculture.  Therefore, we must attach great  importance\r\n\r\nto   education  in  so  far  as  nation  building  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.   Children  start  learning   from   their\r\n\r\nparents.  After  that, they must be  given  classroom\r\n\r\neducation in addition to education at home. Each time\r\n\r\nwe  emphasise the establishment of a rugged  society,\r\n\r\nwe  must  not  forget the important  role  played  by\r\n\r\neducation in bringing up the next generation to  take\r\n\r\nover from the present generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in terms of total expenditure for the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education, it is  my  view  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be an increase instead of a decrease, because\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  inconceivable that when our education  system  is\r\n\r\ngoing  through  a  change, we  should  curtail   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure for education. In switching from academic\r\n\r\nto  technical education, we have to carry out a great\r\n\r\ndeal  of innovations and other changes. It means that\r\n\r\nmoney  is  involved. In my view, if  the  expenditure\r\n\r\nallotted  to  the  Ministry  of  Education   is   not\r\n\r\nincreased,  I  do  not think we  can  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nvarious  changes  and  reforms within  a  very  tight\r\n\r\nbudget  unless we reduce the number of schools.  This\r\n\r\nwill mean a change of policy in view of this decrease\r\n\r\nin expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wish to ask the Minister several\r\n\r\nquestions. Firstly, in terms of expenditure, does  it\r\n\r\nmean that the policy of free primary education may be\r\n\r\nvaried?  In  other words, there will be only  partial\r\n\r\nfree  education  in the primary stage  instead  of  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive free primary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is whether there is any intention\r\n\r\nto  implement  a  scheme  to  scrap  school  building\r\n\r\nprogrammes  which are already in the planning  stages\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the reduction in expenditure.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  are we trying to channel some of our students\r\n\r\ninto private schools instead of Government schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Chinese community leaders made great\r\n\r\ncontributions to education by giving financial aid to\r\n\r\nprivate  schools.  In those days,  they  were  rather\r\n\r\nchauvinistic  and  so  they  spent  their  money   in\r\n\r\npromoting   Chinese   education.  However,   although\r\n\r\nChinese  chauvinism does not exist now, contributions\r\n\r\nfrom  Chinese leaders are not so readily forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIs  it  the  policy of the Ministry of  Education  to\r\n\r\nencourage these people to contribute towards national\r\n\r\neducation?  In  my  view, if  such  encouragement  is\r\n\r\ngiven, it may be possible for us to continue building\r\n\r\nmore  schools  and to continue with our free  primary\r\n\r\neducation policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, as I explained in my speech\r\n\r\non  the  12th December, although this is a standstill\r\n\r\nbudget,  nevertheless  we  have  adequate  funds   to\r\n\r\nprovide for the expansion in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnical education. It is true that, as a result  of\r\n\r\nthis  standstill  budget,  the  funds  available  for\r\n\r\ngeneral   education  are  not  as  much  as   before.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  we  have been  able  to  maintain  the\r\n\r\nexisting  level of expenditure and are able to  carry\r\n\r\nout most of the programmes of activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question of discontinuing with the six-\r\n\r\nyear free primary education in Singapore. Even with a\r\n\r\nstandstill budget, we are able to continue  with  it.\r\n\r\nWhat  I am not able to say is whether we are able  to\r\n\r\nallow  each primary school pupil the maximum of eight\r\n\r\nyears  to finish his primary education. Hitherto,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  able to provide six years'  free  primary\r\n\r\neducation  plus  two  further opportunities  for  the\r\n\r\npupils  to  finish  their primary education.  If  our\r\n\r\nfinancial  resources  should be  further  restricted,\r\n\r\n4hen we may cut down the number of years available to\r\n\r\na  student  in a primary school rather than  do  away\r\n\r\nwith the six-year free primary education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have also explained before, the primary school\r\n\r\nbuilding   programme  and,  for  that   matter,   the\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  programme, in  fact,  ceased  last\r\n\r\nyear.  However,  we  still  have  enough  places   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   to  cater  for  primary  school   pupils.\r\n\r\nHowever,  because of the population shift, there  are\r\n\r\nshortages here and there. But if parents are  not  so\r\n\r\nparticular  about  their  children  being  posted  to\r\n\r\nschools  nearest their homes, there would  be  places\r\n\r\nfor their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our economy in social expenditure,\r\n\r\nthere  is more reason for the Government to encourage\r\n\r\nprivate   support   in  educational   ventures.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will welcome any private individual who is\r\n\r\nkeen  to assist in our school-building programme.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  in  Toa  Payoh  for  instance,  we  are  quite\r\n\r\nprepared  to  release  some of our  school  sites  to\r\n\r\nprivate  organisations  or individuals  if  they  are\r\n\r\nprepared to build primary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave to\r\n\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $198,712,470 for Head 0701 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0801 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications is a newly\r\n\r\nestablished  Ministry.

On the other hand,\r\n\r\nit   signifies  that  there  are  more  communication\r\n\r\nproblems  to  be faced. Under the able leadership  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  the  Ministry of  Communications  has\r\n\r\nstarted  a series of new measures. For instance,  the\r\n\r\none  way traffic system has been implemented many  of\r\n\r\nthe   busy  roads,  and  at  cross-roads,  pedestrian\r\n\r\ncrossings have been marked out. A Transport  Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard  has  also  been set up to advise  on  problems\r\n\r\nrelating to transportation, and two advisers from the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom have been invited to Singapore to give\r\n\r\nassistance  and  make  their  recommendations.  These\r\n\r\nmeasures undertaken by the Ministry are encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still many car accidents on the\r\n\r\nroad.  According  to  the police,  290  persons  were\r\n\r\nkilled as a result of car accidents during the  first\r\n\r\n11 months of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of public transportation, there are\r\n\r\ntwo  aspects.

I think our capable Minister will be able to\r\n\r\nsolve  these problems and thereby improve our  public\r\n\r\ntransport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the two experts from the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  have  recommended that public  transport  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  be nationalised.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the Minister has considered this suggestion.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I wish to know the work done so far\r\n\r\nby the Transport Advisory Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to raise a question on the shortage\r\n\r\nof  taxis. According to unofficial statistics,  there\r\n\r\nare about 15,000 to 20,000 taxi-drivers but there are\r\n\r\nonly  4,000 taxis. Will the Minister consider issuing\r\n\r\nmore  licences  in  order to solve  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also point out that the administration of\r\n\r\npublic  transport  is in a mess.  For  instance,  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of Vehicles is responsible for the  control\r\n\r\nof vehicles while the police deals with pirate taxis.\r\n\r\nOther  matters relating to public transport are under\r\n\r\nthe  charge of other offices. The Car Parks  Division\r\n\r\nhas marked out parking lots along many roads and,  as\r\n\r\na  result, the roads have become narrower. On the one\r\n\r\nhand, the Transport Advisory Board is trying to widen\r\n\r\nthe  roads to ease the traffic problem, but,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the Car Parks Division  is  making  the\r\n\r\nroads  narrower. I would therefore suggest  that  all\r\n\r\nmatters  of  public transport should come  under  one\r\n\r\nMinistry, that is, the Ministry of Communications. In\r\n\r\nthis way, we can improve public transport, reduce the\r\n\r\nnumber of car accidents and also safeguard the  lives\r\n\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is rather embarrassing to\r\n\r\nanswer what I would say the kudos that has been given\r\n\r\nto  me,  whereas it is actually my other  Ministerial\r\n\r\ncolleagues  who have been responsible  for  the  good\r\n\r\nwork  that  has  been mentioned  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang. I would like to draw his attention to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that if he sees new roads and extensions  being\r\n\r\nmade, new ped~strian crossings being marked out,  and\r\n\r\nnew  flyovers  being  built,  the  credit  for  these\r\n\r\nprojects is rightly due to my colleague, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development. I do not therefore wish  to\r\n\r\ntake credit for them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang covered considerable ground\r\n\r\nin  his speech -some of his remarks are for and  some\r\n\r\nare  against my Ministry - and he ended up by  making\r\n\r\ncertain suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I touch upon the points raised by the\r\n\r\nMember?  The  decision to appoint two  advisers  from\r\n\r\nLondon to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurvey  the possibility of mass transit for Singapore\r\n\r\nhad  been  taken  before  I assumed'  office  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Communications.  Unfortunately,   this\r\n\r\nreport  is,  at  the moment, still confidential.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  is studying the impact of their  proposal\r\n\r\nwhich  recommends that Singapore should consider  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  what  is  known  as  an  underground\r\n\r\ntransport service in Singapore. This matter  has  got\r\n\r\nto  be studied because of the financial implications.\r\n\r\nI will not disclose the exact figures, but it is more\r\n\r\nthan a few hundred million dollars. This means that I\r\n\r\nwill be competing with my colleague, the Minister for\r\n\r\nDefence, who requires over $300 million per annum. So\r\n\r\nI  do  not think Singapore, at this stage,  is  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  consider such a proposal,  but  we  are\r\n\r\nstudying the various aspects of this problem. At  the\r\n\r\npresent moment, I am afraid I am not able to say more\r\n\r\nthan  this,  because  the  Minister  for  Finance  is\r\n\r\nlooking into the economic implications of such a  proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Transport Advisory Board, it was\r\n\r\nformed  in August 1968. The Chairman of the Board  is\r\n\r\nmy  Parliamentary  Secretary. I  believe  an  interim\r\n\r\nreport has been prepared, but I have not received  it\r\n\r\nand I am again not in a position to inform the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang what those recommendations  would  be.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  it  will be possible to do so  at  the  next\r\n\r\nsitting  of  Parliament and I  hope  that  after  the\r\n\r\nfestive  season  we will be able to  settle  down  to\r\n\r\nstudy seriously the proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that the number of accidents\r\n\r\nand  deaths which occur on the roads in Singapore  is\r\n\r\non the high side, although there is a National Safety\r\n\r\nFirst   Council   which  is  fairly  active,   having\r\n\r\ninstituted a number of road safety campaigns. It will\r\n\r\nbe  remembered  that a few days ago  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong  did  raise the same question and I  indicated\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of Communications would institute a\r\n\r\nsustained campaign for road safety next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang then went on to deal with\r\n\r\nthe problem of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  transport  in Singapore  and  mentioned  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  indeed  a  tremendous shortage  of  public\r\n\r\nservice  vehicles. Here again, I would  not  like  to\r\n\r\nanticipate  what  the Transport Advisory  Board  will\r\n\r\nrecommend,  but I can endorse what the  Member  said,\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  a  shortage of such  public  service\r\n\r\nvehicles. I understand that bus companies have placed\r\n\r\nan  order for 150 new buses which they hope to put on\r\n\r\nthe  road by next year. As for taxis, there  are,  at\r\n\r\npresent, 3,800 taxis and not 4,000 taxis as stated by\r\n\r\nthe  Member.  This comes again within  the  terms  of\r\n\r\nreference of the Transport Advisory Board. I  believe\r\n\r\nthere is a move afoot which will help to resolve this\r\n\r\nproblem,  although what it is I am not in a  position\r\n\r\nto disclose today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Sembawang has criticised the\r\n\r\ncollection of licence fees and so on in the  Registry\r\n\r\nof Vehicles. There is congestion in Middle Road where\r\n\r\nthe  Registry has to deal with hundreds of  thousands\r\n\r\nof  licence holders. It has been stated in this House\r\n\r\nthat  we  shall  be decentralising the collection  of\r\n\r\nlicence  fees for next year by making use of  the  40\r\n\r\nodd  post  offices  which are  found  throughout  the\r\n\r\nisland.  We shall also be using an electric  computer\r\n\r\nfor this purpose. We do hope to see an improvement in\r\n\r\nthe situation next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of pirate taxis has again cropped up,\r\n\r\nand  mention has been made of the Car Parks  Division\r\n\r\nusing more and more public roads for the purposes  of\r\n\r\ncar  parks  and the collection of fees  thereon.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  of  pirate taxis, however, comes within  the\r\n\r\nprovince  of  the  Ministry of Defence  which  is  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of the Traffic Police. The Car Parks Division\r\n\r\ncomes  under the Ministry of National Development.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Sembawang ended his speech  with\r\n\r\nquite  a good suggestion that the Traffic Police  and\r\n\r\nthe  Car Parks Division should be transferred to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Communications. I am very grateful  for\r\n\r\nthis  suggestion, but I prefer not to be saddled with\r\n\r\nmore departments than I can handle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  true  that  it  will be easier  if  both  the\r\n\r\ndepartments  are  consolidated into one.  However,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is a suggestion which can be considered  by\r\n\r\nthe  two  Ministers concerned rather than for  me  to\r\n\r\nagree  with  it.

There were occasions when it took about\r\n\r\n45  minutes for passengers to get their bags from the\r\n\r\nconveyor  belt. The few luggage porters who  happened\r\n\r\nto be around adopted a couldn't-care-less attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the wake of our extensive campaign to woo\r\n\r\ntourists and develop our tourist industry, I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  will look into this matter and improve  the\r\n\r\nexisting  facilities immediately.

I think this can\r\n\r\nhappen  even  at the best of airports.  Sometimes,  a\r\n\r\npassenger arrives at Airport A and finds that he will\r\n\r\nnot get his luggage because it has gone to Airport B.\r\n\r\nIt  will  then not be delayed for 45 minutes  but  45\r\n\r\ndays!  I  believe  one of our Members  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nfound  that he had no luggage when he arrived in  New\r\n\r\nYork and he was recompensed. Later on, he did get his\r\n\r\nluggage  after having been recompensed by the airline\r\n\r\ncompany concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So unless the Member for Havelock is able to give me\r\n\r\nspecific  instances, it will be  very  difficult  not\r\n\r\nonly  for  me but also for the department to  try  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate the problem and deal with it. But I  will\r\n\r\naccept  his statement that it is possible that  these\r\n\r\nincidents have taken place and that it should be  our\r\n\r\nendeavour  to  give  satisfactory service,  not  only\r\n\r\nbecause tourists are coming to Singapore, but because\r\n\r\nthis  service  is  also expected of  any  airport  or\r\n\r\nairline company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, first of all, say that at the present moment\r\n\r\ncertain airlines are responsible for the handling  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own luggage and that other airlines have asked\r\n\r\nthe  Department  of Civil Aviation  to  handle  their\r\n\r\nluggage  for  a  fee. So if it is  possible  for  the\r\n\r\nMember for Havelock to state which particular airline\r\n\r\nwas  at fault, then we can dig into the matter. I see\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  on  the  point  of  giving  me  certain\r\n\r\ninformation, so I will sit down for him to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Sir, the Minister can look into\r\n\r\nthe  handling  of  luggage by  porters  of  Malaysia-\r\n\r\nSingapore Airlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I would have preferred him to say\r\n\r\nso  in the first place.

I  have  personal\r\n\r\nexperience of not only leaving Singapore Airport  for\r\n\r\nother countries, but also of making regular visits to\r\n\r\nthe  airport  to  receive  international  guests.  My\r\n\r\nobservations confirm the fact that there are signs of\r\n\r\ncongestion  and  delay in clearance  at  the  arrival\r\n\r\nchannels particularly during certain periods of heavy\r\n\r\nair  traffic.  I  think sometimes the passengers  and\r\n\r\nthose  whom I receive do feel a bit irritated because\r\n\r\nof  the  delay  in  clearance. This  is  quite  under\r\n\r\nstandable because after having travelled for 10 or 20\r\n\r\nhours,  they  are extremely tired and therefore  they\r\n\r\nneed a quick clearance service so that they can go to\r\n\r\ntheir  hotels as quickly as possible. I  do  not  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  arrival channels in our  airport  are  not\r\n\r\nadequate to meet the present demands. There  must  be\r\n\r\ncertain occasions when there is a heavy flow  of  air\r\n\r\ntraffic. I am thinking in terms of the development of\r\n\r\nour tourist trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the present flow of air traffic and\r\n\r\nthe  number  of passengers arriving at  the  airport.\r\n\r\nthere should be a considerable increase in the number\r\n\r\nof passengers moving in and out of the airport. As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  we  see  signs of congestion  and  delay.  I\r\n\r\nwonder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether the situation will not be aggravated  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  that it will become extremely intolerable.  I\r\n\r\nadmit  there  are  occasions when I feel  proud  that\r\n\r\nSingapore has a very efficient airport. There was one\r\n\r\noccasion in particular when I felt extremely proud of\r\n\r\nour  airport  and  that  was  when  I  arrived  at  a\r\n\r\nneighbouring   airport  where  the   facilities   and\r\n\r\nconditions were atrocious. I said to myself  that  we\r\n\r\nin  Singapore are living in heaven. Our airport is  a\r\n\r\nplace  where  we  even go to spend  our  recreational\r\n\r\nhours  because  of  the  very  pleasant  surroundings\r\n\r\nthere. But I have reason to feel a little small  when\r\n\r\nI compare the facilities in our airport with those of\r\n\r\nother  international airports. I agree that we should\r\n\r\nnot  make a comparison because we are a small country\r\n\r\nwith limited resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, if we place emphasis on the\r\n\r\nimportance of air traffic, particularly in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  should  think in terms of making  our  airport  a\r\n\r\ntruly  international airport, even to the  extent  of\r\n\r\ncatering for the jumbo jets. We should also think  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  cashing in on the tourist trade. One  very\r\n\r\nimportant  factor  has  also to  be  considered.  Our\r\n\r\nairport  facilities  should be in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\nstandards  that  we  intend  to  set  for  our  hotel\r\n\r\nindustry,  taxi  service and shops, because  I  think\r\n\r\ntravellers are usually irritable after a long flight.\r\n\r\nSometimes  the four arrival channels in  our  airport\r\n\r\ncannot  meet  the  demands of a  heavy  flow  of  air\r\n\r\ntraffic,  and  I  see a need for an increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  arrival  channels  in  the  near  future.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  there is a need for quicker clearance  of\r\n\r\nthe passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Minister for Communications should look into these essential matters, not so much in terms of meeting the present intolerable position but of meeting a position that will arrive in the very near future. I am beginning to see signs of strain at the airport with the number\r\n\r\nof passengers coming in and going out. We should take\r\n\r\nheed  of  these signs and take the necessary remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am glad that the Member for\r\n\r\nMoulmein  has come out in full support of the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Havelock, that it was his experience  also  that\r\n\r\nthere  is delay in the clearance not only of  luggage\r\n\r\nbut  also of passengers at our airport. But in saying\r\n\r\nso  he  did  mention  that this happens  only  during\r\n\r\ncertain hours. That is the peculiar situation  of  an\r\n\r\nairport.  At our airport, more planes would  land  or\r\n\r\ntake  off  during certain hours of the day  or  night\r\n\r\nthan  at  other  times. Especially between  8.00  and 11.00  a.m, \r\n\r\nand from 4.00 to 9.00 p.m., more  planes\r\n\r\nwould come in or take off. It is during these periods\r\n\r\nthat one gets the impression of congestion and delay.\r\n\r\nWhereas  if  a  plane lands or takes off  during  the\r\n\r\nother hours, it is very simple for passengers to pass\r\n\r\nthrough the various gates and go straight on  to  the\r\n\r\naircraft. These are problems which have to  be  faced\r\n\r\nnot  only in this airport but also airports all  over\r\n\r\nthe  world.  For some curious reason, passengers  who\r\n\r\ntravel by air like to choose a convenient hour.  Most\r\n\r\nairlines  try  to  oblige passengers and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  get  more  passengers if they  take  off, say,\r\n\r\naround  eight  in the morning so that the  passengers\r\n\r\nneed not have to wake up at five in the morning, have\r\n\r\na  quick  shave  and  rush  to  the  airport, it  is\r\n\r\npossible,  therefore, for a particular  passenger  to\r\n\r\nproceed  to  the  airport as if he is  attending  his\r\n\r\noffice.  He  has his breakfast, reads his  newspapers\r\n\r\nand then turns up at the airport at a very convenient\r\n\r\nhour, which is about eight o'clock in the morning. So\r\n\r\nevery  airline will try to take off their  planes  at\r\n\r\nabout  the same period; that is, at 8.00, 8.15, 8.30,\r\n\r\n9.00  or  9.15 in the morning. Or when the passengers\r\n\r\nleave the other side of the world and come here - if,\r\n\r\nfor  example, it is an overnight flight -they  prefer\r\n\r\nto  arrive  here at a convenient hour in the  evening\r\n\r\nbefore  taking off. So these are problems created  by\r\n\r\nthe  airlines themselves, because they  all  want  to\r\n\r\ncrowd  into what are known as popular periods.  Hence\r\n\r\nthe congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that we are planning for the\r\n\r\nfuture. In fact, we do know that the jumbo jets  will\r\n\r\nbe  using  Singapore Airport in 1971. The  Australian\r\n\r\nAirline,  Qantas, has placed orders for a  few  jumbo\r\n\r\njets.  Survey  teams  have  come  to  Singapore   for\r\n\r\ndiscussions.  They  intend to start  a  service  from\r\n\r\nSydney  to  London. The plane will stop at  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Bahrain before going on to London, it  is  true\r\n\r\nthat if a jumbo jet lands at Singapore and if all the\r\n\r\npassengers  disembark, they can easily  fill  up  one\r\n\r\nhotel.  Although a jumbo jet can hold 490 passengers,\r\n\r\ntravelling  economy class, most airlines  will  carry\r\n\r\nonly 360 passengers, because they will have about  50\r\n\r\npassengers, first-class and the remaining 310 will be\r\n\r\npassengers travelling economy class. Yet we will have\r\n\r\nquite  a  problem to process 360 passengers once  the\r\n\r\nplane  lands.  This is a problem which is  exercising\r\n\r\nnot  only  our  minds  but also the  minds  of  other\r\n\r\nairports which are likely to handle jumbo jets. It is\r\n\r\nbecause of this that we have frozen certain plans for\r\n\r\nextensions to the Paya Lebar Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before yesterday, the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens  asked what steps were being taken to develop\r\n\r\nour  airport for the future. I indicated in my  reply\r\n\r\nthat  we  had employed a firm of consultants to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the expansion plans of our airport up to  1990.\r\n\r\nFor  the time being, although we have plans to extend\r\n\r\nthe   facilities   at   the  airport   for   handling\r\n\r\npassengers,  cargoes  and so on,  we  have  found  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  freeze  the  plans  till  we  get   an\r\n\r\nassessment  from  this firm of consultants.  We  hope\r\n\r\nthat  when  this report is ready sometime next  year,\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be  able to  make  firm  plans  for\r\n\r\nextensions  or  make provision for  facilities  which\r\n\r\nwill assist in easing the so-called congestion at the\r\n\r\nairport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank\r\n\r\nmy friend, the Member for Moulmein, for supporting my\r\n\r\nstatement.  Ministers  come  in  through  the  V.I.P.\r\n\r\nChannel  on their arrival at the airport.

Of  course, the loss of  a  baggage  could\r\n\r\nhappen  even in the best of airports. Even in  Tokyo,\r\n\r\nthe  busiest airport in Asia, it took us no less than\r\n\r\n20  minutes  to  have our luggage  cleared.  When  we\r\n\r\ncompare  standards, Sir, I take it  that  we  compare\r\n\r\nours with only the best and not with those which  are\r\n\r\nnot  up  to  our  standards.

I  agree  with  him that  we  should  compare\r\n\r\nourselves  with the best available and not  take  the\r\n\r\npoor  services  of  other  airports  as  a  basis  of\r\n\r\ncomparison.  That is why we do not have to  say  that\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are  wooing tourists, we must  therefore\r\n\r\nimprove  our  airport service. I  think  our  service\r\n\r\nshould be good even without the tourists. That is the\r\n\r\ntest, and our staff at the airport should be made  to\r\n\r\nrealise  what we expect them to do. I agree with  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Havelock, too, that I go to  the  V.I.P.\r\n\r\nlounge or room, but he must not assume that I am  not\r\n\r\naware  of the situation.

Of course, the staff may have been\r\n\r\nalerted to put things right when I am around.  But  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure the Member for Havelock that I  generally\r\n\r\nask  to see things that are not arranged.

With  the  impressive\r\n\r\nlengthening of the runway which is to come  about  to\r\n\r\ntake  in such huge aircraft as the jumbo jets, I  can\r\n\r\nwell  imagine that the present disadvantage  will  be\r\n\r\nenhanced.

I visited  the\r\n\r\nrunway of the airfield and I know exactly where it is\r\n\r\nlocated. They gave me an exhibition of how they would\r\n\r\ntackle  a  fire  in  case it  breaks  out.  With  the\r\n\r\nextended  runway, the extra 2,000 feet -  the  runway\r\n\r\nhas  been  extended from 9,000 to 11,000  feet  -  is\r\n\r\nquite  close  to  the fire station  at  the  Airport.\r\n\r\nUnless the Member's information is not quite right, I\r\n\r\ncan assure him that even with the arrival\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the jumbo jets, the fire station is quite in order\r\n\r\nwhere  it  is.

In this connection, my reply to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon  Gardens yesterday  was  that  we  had\r\n\r\nordered  a high capacity foam tender which should  be\r\n\r\navailable very soon to augment the equipment we  have\r\n\r\nat the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have brought the\r\n\r\nmatter  to the attention of the Minister as a  result\r\n\r\nof  a  discourse  which  I had  with  a  professional\r\n\r\nsource. The opinion is that it is preferable to  have\r\n\r\nthe  siting of the fire station on the other side  of\r\n\r\nthe  runway - on some high ground - which would  enable\r\n\r\nit  to  command a thorough and comprehensive view  of\r\n\r\nthe  runway. As the fire fighting unit is at  present\r\n\r\nsited,  it  is  on  the  near side  of  the  terminal\r\n\r\nbuilding.  In  the view of the fire officers  in  the\r\n\r\nunit, the intended extension of the terminal building\r\n\r\nmight perhaps cause a blockage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, since the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon  Gardens has asserted that  he  understands\r\n\r\nfrom  a  reliable source that the site  of  the  fire\r\n\r\nstation  is not in an ideal position. I want  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  my  brief  coming from the  Director  of  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation - unless he does not know his job - is  that\r\n\r\nthe  existing site of the fire station is  a  central\r\n\r\none where attendance to any part of the runway can be\r\n\r\nmade  in the shortest possible time.

The Member thinks that the  fire\r\n\r\nstation  is  a little out of place, and I  say  that,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  brief obtained from my top civil  aviation\r\n\r\nofficial, it is in a central position.

I will try my best, although the query is on\r\n\r\nthe   personal   emoluments  of   the   Director   of\r\n\r\nTelecommunications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable and Wireless Limited was taken over by the\r\n\r\nGovernment in January 1966 and I came on the scene in\r\n\r\nApril 1968. During the last eight months I have  been\r\n\r\nslowly  trying  to  pick up the threads.  I  have  to\r\n\r\nanswer  to  the best of my ability the five questions\r\n\r\nput by the Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, whether there has been any undue delay in the\r\n\r\nintegration  of  Cable and Wireless  staff  with  the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications   Department.   Speaking   as   an\r\n\r\nindividual,  I think there has been a  lot  of  delay\r\n\r\nbecause  it  has been going on for almost two  years.\r\n\r\nThere   might   have   been   difficulties   in   the\r\n\r\nnegotiations, but I do not think I am in  a  position\r\n\r\nto comment favourably or unfavourably on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's next question is about the union and\r\n\r\nalthough  he did not mention its name, I believe  the\r\n\r\nunion  that  he has in mind is the Telecommunications\r\n\r\nTechnicians   Union.  There  are  two   unions:   one\r\n\r\nrepresents ex-Cable and Wireless staff known  as  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Telecommunications Workers' Union, and  the\r\n\r\nother is a smaller union which represents workers  in\r\n\r\nthe   Telecommunications  Department  in   Government\r\n\r\nservice. When the Member makes the statement that the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Technicians Union has been refused\r\n\r\nattendance  at  the negotiations, I presume  what  he\r\n\r\nsays must be correct, otherwise he will not have  put\r\n\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the staff of the original\r\n\r\nTelecommunications   Department   are   put   in   an\r\n\r\nunfavourable position as a result of the integration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   former  Cable  and  Wireless  employees  in  the\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department. I think  the  exercise\r\n\r\nis  really how to integrate Cable and Wireless  Union\r\n\r\nstaff  into Government service. They were part  of  a\r\n\r\ncommercial organisation, and when the Government paid\r\n\r\n$10  million  to take over the assets and liabilities\r\n\r\nof Cable and Wireless Ltd., they had to look into the\r\n\r\nquestion  of integrating 500 staff in Cable and  Wire\r\n\r\nless  into Government service. I do not think  anyone\r\n\r\nshould suffer as a result of the take-over. The delay\r\n\r\nin  the  discussions and negotiations must be due  to\r\n\r\nthe difficulty in marrying the terms of service in  a\r\n\r\ncommercial organisation with the terms of service  in\r\n\r\na  Government institution. This has been going on for\r\n\r\nthe   last  two  years.  The  Member's  question   of\r\n\r\nintegration  and  its effect on those  in  Government\r\n\r\nservice who are members of the Technicians Union are,\r\n\r\nI  am  afraid,  part of the cause  of  the  so-called\r\n\r\nunhappiness of those in Government service at  seeing\r\n\r\npeople  who  are  probably getting better  pay  in  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  organisation coming into  the  Government\r\n\r\nservice  and having to learn how to adjust themselves\r\n\r\nin this situation. I understand that the negotiations\r\n\r\nfor  the integration of the 500 staff from the former\r\n\r\nCable and Wireless into Government service are almost\r\n\r\ncompleted except for very minor matters like hours of\r\n\r\nwork  and  so forth. I would hate to pass comment  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage  when the negotiations are  about  to  be\r\n\r\ncompleted  on  how to resolve the little difficulties\r\n\r\nwhich are to be found in all negotiations. Nobody  is\r\n\r\never happy about his salary scale. Even those who get\r\n\r\nan increment complain that they deserve more. This is\r\n\r\npart and parcel of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the matter can be resolved provided the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance will relent  in  its  attitude,\r\n\r\nbecause  in  all  these negotiations, representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  the Ministry of Finance will be there to ensure\r\n\r\nthat a fair deal is given to the new employees. I  do\r\n\r\nnot think I can go further than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nquite satisfied with the Minister's explanation and I\r\n\r\nbeg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $17,740,440 for Head 0806 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0807 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0807 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, I would like to talk about the horns of\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicles.  I think the horn is  used  to  warn\r\n\r\npedestrians but, at present, we can hear  the  sounds\r\n\r\nof  multi-tone horns and we do not know  whether  the\r\n\r\nchildren  are meddling with the horns or whether  the\r\n\r\nsound actually comes from the car. Some horns produce\r\n\r\na  sound like that of a dog barking, some sound  like\r\n\r\nmusic  and some even produce the sounds of the  siren\r\n\r\nof  an  ambulance, a fire engine or a  police  patrol\r\n\r\ncar.  I  do  not  know whether such horns  have  been\r\n\r\napproved  by  the Registry of Vehicles. I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  if  the horns in use on motor vehicles are  not\r\n\r\nstandardised,  then  it will  not  be  safe  for  the\r\n\r\npedestrians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about the obnoxious smoke emitted\r\n\r\nby  motor  vehicles. I understand that such smoke  is\r\n\r\ndangerous  and  harmful  to  health.  It  is  usually\r\n\r\nemitted  from public vehicles and sometimes  also  by\r\n\r\nprivate  cars. What measures have been taken  by  the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Vehicles to deal with it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about the cleanliness in public\r\n\r\nbuses. It seems that less attention is being paid  to\r\n\r\nthis  matter  and most of the buses are  very  dirty,\r\n\r\nboth inside and outside. They are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nproperly washed.

During  the  auctions,  many  old,\r\n\r\ndilapidated and unserviceable vehicles are sold. As a\r\n\r\nresult,  the  public have been able to  buy  some  of\r\n\r\nthese vehicles at the lowest possible price and  they\r\n\r\ncan  use  them  as  pirate taxis. We  therefore  very\r\n\r\nfrequently see such pirate taxis on the road. So  the\r\n\r\nmeasures taken against pirate taxis are more or  less\r\n\r\noffset  by the auction of confiscated vehicles  which\r\n\r\nare eventually put back on the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether in future\r\n\r\nauctions   of   confiscated   vehicles,   all   those\r\n\r\nunserviceable  vehicles will be condemned,  and  what\r\n\r\nsteps will be taken to ensure that auctioned vehicles\r\n\r\nwill not be used as pirate taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to take the opportunity to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister   whether   he  will  consider   introducing\r\n\r\nlegislation requiring all vehicles that have been  on\r\n\r\nthe  road  for,  say, 10 years, to  undergo  a  road-\r\n\r\nworthiness  test annually. I am quite  sure  a  great\r\n\r\nnumber  of  accidents are caused  by  faulty  brakes,\r\n\r\nsteering   and   poor  mechanical  maintenance.   The\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of  such vehicles very often  causes  road\r\n\r\ncongestion.

So the  implementation\r\n\r\nfalls  on another Ministry - the Ministry of Defence.\r\n\r\nIt  is felt that perhaps this fine of $20 is much too\r\n\r\nlenient  and  that consideration can be given  to  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the fine in the future. However, this  is\r\n\r\na  matter which will have to be left in the hands  of\r\n\r\nmy colleague, the Minister for Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> The\r\n\r\nMinister for Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is now up to the Minister for\r\n\r\nLaw  to  consider whether a higher fine will be  more\r\n\r\neffective  to  deter  musical-minded  motorists  from\r\n\r\ninstalling multi-tone horns in their cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies to vehicles which emit exhaust\r\n\r\nsmoke.  May  I  say that they are largely  cars  with\r\n\r\ndiesel  engines.  This  is a  fairly  serious  matter\r\n\r\nbecause,  from  the  health point  of  view,  unburnt\r\n\r\npetrol  gas is known to be carcinogenic, which  means\r\n\r\nthat it can help to produce cancer in the lungs.  The\r\n\r\ncampaign  against vehicles which emit  exhaust  smoke\r\n\r\ncommenced  in  April 1967, it may be of  interest  to\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House  that  5,337  vehicles  were\r\n\r\nsummoned  to the Registry of Vehicles for  mechanical\r\n\r\ninspection during the last II months of this year. Of\r\n\r\nthis  number,  3,848  cases were  compounded  by  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police,  again at a cost  of  $20  each.  So\r\n\r\nperhaps  if the fine is raised to $200 each,  we  may\r\n\r\nsee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  reduction  in  the  number of  cars  going  around\r\n\r\nemitting  exhaust smoke. In the present  regulations,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a section which says that the penalty  for\r\n\r\nthe  first offence is a fine not exceeding $400,  and\r\n\r\nfor  a  second  or  subsequent offences  a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $1,000  or imprisonment  for  a  term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  three months. So I think we  already  have\r\n\r\nrather heavy penalties in the law. I think I will try\r\n\r\nto  persuade my colleague, the Minister for  Defence,\r\n\r\nto  be  a little hard on his Traffic Police and order\r\n\r\nthem  not  to agree to compound an offence  for  just\r\n\r\n$20.  There  is this harsh regulation  which  can  be\r\n\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the buses are not looking as clean as\r\n\r\nthey  should.  Unfortunately, even  after  the  \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  Clean\" campaign - I think the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunications  has  given its full  support  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health in this regard - there  are  some\r\n\r\nbuses  which are very unclean and therefore the atten\r\n\r\ntion of the bus companies should be drawn to the fact\r\n\r\nthat  they are expected to keep their buses clean.  I\r\n\r\nwill instruct the Registrar of Vehicles to issue  the\r\n\r\nnotices accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru spoke on a subject which\r\n\r\nmore  or less moves away from the Ministry of Communi\r\n\r\ncations  to  another Ministry - the  confiscation  of\r\n\r\nvehicles which are presumed to be pirate taxis. Until\r\n\r\nvery  recently, the seizure of pirate taxis could  be\r\n\r\ndone  by  the  police  -  and that  comes  under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence! But we have asked for powers  to\r\n\r\nseize such vehicles next year. For the time being, in\r\n\r\nview  of  the Member's question, I will say  that  as\r\n\r\nthis matter is in the hands of the police, it will be\r\n\r\nleft  to the Ministry of the Interior and Defence  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with.  It  would  appear that  all  confiscated\r\n\r\nvehicles are auctioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

For  instance, take the lorries that  convey\r\n\r\nmaterials such as steel rods, concrete beams and  oil\r\n\r\ndrums  along the public roads. Some of these concrete\r\n\r\nbeams and steel rods are nearly twice as long as  the\r\n\r\nlorry  itself.  I  am  sure that this  constitutes  a\r\n\r\nsafety  hazard.  There  are also  vehicles  that  are\r\n\r\nlicensed  to  carry  goods up to a  certain  tonnage,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the size and capacity of the  vehicle.\r\n\r\nSome   of   the  transport  contractors  have   taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of this regulation and they pile  up  goods\r\n\r\nseveral  feet high on their lorries. To make  matters\r\n\r\nworse,  the  attendants sit on top of the goods.  Two\r\n\r\nmonths  ago,  in Jurong, I noticed a lorry  conveying\r\n\r\nfour  large  crates of knocked-down car  units  which\r\n\r\nwere  not  secured  with rope, and while  rounding  a\r\n\r\ncircus,  one of the crates fell on the road.  It  was\r\n\r\nfortunate that there were no vehicles around at  that\r\n\r\ntime,  otherwise it could have caused a very  serious\r\n\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor contributing to accidents is the\r\n\r\ntraffic-indicators on lorries and buses. Many lorries\r\n\r\n--particularly earth-carrying lorries -  are  covered\r\n\r\nwith  mud and some of them have no lenses. So no  one\r\n\r\nwill  know whether the lights are red or white. There\r\n\r\nis  also the position of the indicators. Some of them\r\n\r\nare  hidden  below the rear fenders of the  vehicles.\r\n\r\nThey  are very difficult to see until one is two feet\r\n\r\naway from the vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that the Ministry look into this\r\n\r\nmatter  and  ensure that goods of exceptional  length\r\n\r\nare  conveyed in trailers, unless the vehicle so used\r\n\r\nis  of sufficient length to accommodate at least two-\r\n\r\nthirds of the length of such materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am grateful to the Member for\r\n\r\nToa Payoh for his suggestions to improve road safety.\r\n\r\nHe has spoken on certain road hazards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as lorries carrying steel rods which are twice\r\n\r\nthe length of the lorry itself, lorries\r\n\r\ncarrying  numerous drums which are not  secured  with\r\n\r\nrope, and lorries laden with goods\r\n\r\nwhich  are  very  much heavier  than  what  they  are\r\n\r\nlicensed  to  carry. I think these are matters  which\r\n\r\nimpinge on certain technicalities and I am not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  answer them straight off.

It is in charge of national defence and the security of the people. When Singapore achieved its independence, a Ministry of Defence was set up. Since then it has achieved much in the direction of\r\n\r\nnational defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very short time, however, this Ministry will\r\n\r\nhave to face an even more onerous task. From 1969  up\r\n\r\ntill  1971,  there  will be a  phased  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nBritish  military troops from Singapore. Within  this\r\n\r\nshort space of time the Ministry of Defence will have\r\n\r\nto tackle all the problems relating to the security\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof our people and the defence of our country. I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister for Defence these questions.\r\n\r\nWhen  the British troops are completely withdrawn  in\r\n\r\nthe  l970s, will concrete measures be taken  to  fill\r\n\r\nthe   vacuum   created   by  the   British   military\r\n\r\nwithdrawal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this. At present countries like\r\n\r\nAustralia  and New Zealand are also assisting  us  in\r\n\r\nour defence. I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nAustralian troops will be stationed in Singapore  for\r\n\r\na long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is this. In view of the British\r\n\r\nmilitary withdrawal from Singapore, will the national\r\n\r\nservice  scheme envisage a reduction in  the  age  of\r\n\r\nrecruits? If so, this should also apply to  women.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that at present there is a women's defence\r\n\r\nforce  serving under the Ministry of Defence. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to know whether it is intended to increase  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of this women's defence force. If so,  what\r\n\r\nwill  be the conditions of service? Will they be  the\r\n\r\nsame as those of the men?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): When I asked a\r\n\r\nquestion  for oral answer, I was given to  understand\r\n\r\nthat  we  are going to celebrate the sesquicentennial\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. But there is no provision for such  an\r\n\r\noccasion. Provision for celebrations of this  nature,\r\n\r\nfor   example,  the  National  Day  celebration,   is\r\n\r\nnormally   entered  under  Head  0901   for   defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister why there is no\r\n\r\nprovision under this head for the celebration of  the\r\n\r\n150th anniversary of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I remember I\r\n\r\nraised  a  question  on the People's  Defence  Force.\r\n\r\nEveryone  of the members of this force received  only\r\n\r\none set of uniform. Even at the moment they have only\r\n\r\none set of uniform. The second point is that they are\r\n\r\nnot  given  a transport allowance, whereas  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps members do receive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw the\r\n\r\nattention of the Minister to a trend that is  perhaps\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  this  subject.  I  am  not  making   an\r\n\r\nallegation  or accusation of any sort, because  I  do\r\n\r\nunderstand that it will be largely conjecture  on  my\r\n\r\npart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is quite aware of the fact that there is written into our Constitution a provision that an accused who is apprehended or arrested can be detained for only 24 hours in a police station, after which he must be brought before the court except for certain exceptional circumstances, for instance, when\r\n\r\nan  accused  is arrested on a Saturday. At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  have detention laws in our country.  These\r\n\r\ndetention  laws  are exceptional laws,  because  they\r\n\r\nempower   the   authorities  to   detain   a   person\r\n\r\napprehended without trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did submit a question to the Minister to answer in\r\n\r\nrespect of the number of detentions. I found  that  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial number of persons who were detained under\r\n\r\nthe  detention laws were subsequently charged  before\r\n\r\nthe  court. The Minister is aware that if the  police\r\n\r\nauthorities  proceed under the detention  laws,  they\r\n\r\nwould  be empowered to detain the persons apprehended\r\n\r\nbeyond 24 hours. Of course, if this tendency is real,\r\n\r\nthen  there  is  an evasion of an important  constitu\r\n\r\ntional  protection. By making use  of  the  detention\r\n\r\nlaws,  the police authorities would be able to detain\r\n\r\nthe  apprehended person for more than  24  hours  and\r\n\r\nthen  subsequently have him charged before the court.\r\n\r\nConstitutionally speaking, he ought  to  be  released\r\n\r\nwithin  24  hours  if  he is not charged  before  the\r\n\r\ncourt.  My  question to the Minister also did  reveal\r\n\r\nthat  in  a number of cases where detention was  made\r\n\r\nunder   the   Criminal  Law  (Temporary   Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  such  persons were  subsequently  charged\r\n\r\nbefore the court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
