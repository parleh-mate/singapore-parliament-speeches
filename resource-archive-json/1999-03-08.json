Every economy  is  being\r\n\r\nput  to  a  real  test  and they will come  out  with  different\r\n\r\nresponses.   Take, for example, Hong Kong and  Singapore.   Even\r\n\r\nthough both of us are among the world's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfreest economies, yet we come out with very different responses.\r\n\r\nJust  last week, the Hong Kong Secretary for Trade and  Industry\r\n\r\nexplained  the  different responses between Singapore  and  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  by  saying  that  it was because the Singapore  Government\r\n\r\ncontrols  the people, the trade unions, and so on,  whereas  the\r\n\r\nHong  Kong people are more creative, more innovative.  I have  a\r\n\r\ndifferent explanation.  I think the core issue is that  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  100  years, Hong Kong has been busy building a competitive\r\n\r\neconomy, whereas in the case of Singapore, in the last 33 years,\r\n\r\nwe have been busy building a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big difference between building an economy and\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  nation.   In the case of Hong Kong,  the  focus  is\r\n\r\npurely on competitiveness.  In the case of Singapore, we adopt a\r\n\r\nbalanced approach between competitiveness and cohesion.  Because\r\n\r\nof  this equal emphasis on competitiveness and cohesion, we  are\r\n\r\nable to achieve unity in purpose, have a cohesive people and one\r\n\r\nunited people.  That is why we are able to move together in  one\r\n\r\nforce.  Sir, there is a saying that people do not care how  much\r\n\r\nthe  government  knows until they know how much  the  government\r\n\r\ncares.   If  you  were  to look at the two  off-Budget  measures\r\n\r\nannounced by the Minister and the Budget announced this year, if\r\n\r\nyou  look  at  the three Budgets in totality, it is quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat,  firstly, this Government does know how to run the economy\r\n\r\nand  the  kind of difficulties the business community is facing.\r\n\r\nHence   these   various   cost-cutting   measures.    But   more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  it also clearly demonstrated that  the  Government\r\n\r\ndoes care for the people knowing the kind of pain the people are\r\n\r\ngoing  through  as  a  result  of wage  reductions  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   the  Government  has  introduced  a  total   rebate\r\n\r\namounting to about $485 million.  It is a clear concrete  action\r\n\r\non  the part of the Government to demonstrate that it knows  how\r\n\r\nto run the economy and it cares for the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as a labour MP, I fully support the financial policy\r\n\r\nannounced by the Minister.  Sir, this Budget 1999-2000 is a very\r\n\r\nsignificant one for two reasons, at least.  Firstly,  this  will\r\n\r\nbe the first time that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to  run  into a significant  operating  deficit.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  this is the Budget that will take us  into  the  next\r\n\r\ncentury.  I feel it is very important that we make full  use  of\r\n\r\nthis  Budget  to spur Singaporeans to embrace a new  mindset  in\r\n\r\npreparation for the new millennium.  To transform the mindset of\r\n\r\nthe  population, I think it is very much like trying  to  change\r\n\r\nthe  shape  of  a  block of solid ice.  One way  to  do  it  is,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  \"de-freeze\" the ice, because a solid block of  ice  is\r\n\r\nvery  hard  to reshape.  But if you can de-freeze  the  ice  and\r\n\r\nreshape  the water and then re-freeze the water, we can  end  up\r\n\r\nwith  a  new mindset, like a new block of ice with a new  shape,\r\n\r\nwithout  losing  too  much water.  Looking  at  the  mindset  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  over  the last 33 years, we  do  form  a  certain\r\n\r\nmindset  after  all  these  years.   And  now  this  mindset  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is  de-freezing under the  heat  of  the  regional\r\n\r\ncrisis.   In  a  way, I think our challenge is to capitalise  on\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity  now  to reshape the mindset  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbefore  this mindset is being re-frozen again.  The next two  to\r\n\r\nthree  years is really a window of opportunity for us to do  so.\r\n\r\nEven  though the cyclical recovery of the Singapore  economy  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  happen, maybe over the next six months  to  a  year,\r\n\r\nstructural  recovery is not likely to take place until  after  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  a  few  years of concerted effort  by  all  parties.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is very important that over this period of two  to\r\n\r\nthree years, we make full use of the financial policies to  spur\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans, business community, civil servants towards  a\r\n\r\nnew  mindset, so that we can move together in one force, in  one\r\n\r\nunited direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I feel that there are three areas we can do\r\n\r\nwith more emphasis in the implementation of the financial policy\r\n\r\nthis coming year.  These three areas are the public sector,  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector and the people sector.  Firstly, in  the  public\r\n\r\nsector,  I feel that 1999-2000 is a good time for us to forge  a\r\n\r\nnew  mindset in the public sector among the civil servants.   In\r\n\r\nthe  past,  we have always looked at unspent budget as something\r\n\r\nbad because it adds further to budget surplus.  But this year is\r\n\r\ndifferent.  We are going to have a budget deficit,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  means  any Ministry that is able to save  on  the  annual\r\n\r\nbudget  is,  in  fact,  going to help us to  reduce  the  budget\r\n\r\ndeficit.   So  any unspent budget should be viewed as  something\r\n\r\ngood rather than bad.  In fact, if the civil service can improve\r\n\r\nspending  or  achieve a saving of 1% alone, it  will  amount  to\r\n\r\nabout  $292 million.  It is a lot of money.  If we are  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve a 5% improvement in cost optimisation, the total  saving\r\n\r\nwill  come  to  $1.5 billion, which is about 30% of  the  budget\r\n\r\ndeficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my main point here is this. I am actually very comfortable\r\n\r\nwith the $5.1 billion budget deficit, but my point is that I  am\r\n\r\nnot  convinced that every civil servant is putting every  dollar\r\n\r\nto  the best use.  We are putting the money to good use but  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily to the best use.  My suggestion is why  not  send  a\r\n\r\nclear  message  to all civil servants to take  this  year  as  a\r\n\r\nbeginning of the new year to challenge ourselves on how we  can,\r\n\r\nas   a  public  sector,  achieve  better  outcomes  with  lesser\r\n\r\nresources.  And here I have two suggestions on how this  can  be\r\n\r\ndone.  Firstly, send a clear guideline to all Ministries to  cut\r\n\r\ndown  on  the  \"nice-to-have\" spending on  hardware  facilities.\r\n\r\nBecause I feel that over time, our hardware facilities, like the\r\n\r\nschools,  hospitals,  including bus stops, are  getting  better-looking  year after year.  There is a danger that  we  may  have\r\n\r\ngone over board.  Choosing between a public institution of a  5-star  hardware facility and a 3-star software capability  versus\r\n\r\none   with   5-star  software  capability  and  3-star  hardware\r\n\r\nfacility, I think any time I will go for the one that is able to\r\n\r\noffer   5-star   software  capability  because   this   software\r\n\r\ncapability  is  what will make a difference in  the  quality  of\r\n\r\npublic  services  to  the members of the public.   By  making  a\r\n\r\nconstant  check on cost control on hardware spending, hopefully,\r\n\r\nwe  would be able to reduce the cost of public services  to  the\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion is that as far as the hardware design and hardware\r\n\r\nspending  are  concerned, let us remind ourselves that  we  must\r\n\r\ncontinue    to    focus    on    functionality,    buildability,\r\n\r\nmaintainability,  and so on.  Better still,  why  not  set  cost\r\n\r\nstandards and challenge the Ministries to try\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto achieve saving over the next few years?  At the same time, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  challenge the Ministries to set clear targets  on  how\r\n\r\nthey  can improve on software capability.  Today we already have\r\n\r\nthe  Budgeting For Results system in place.  Why not we  require\r\n\r\nall  Ministries now to clearly spell out exactly  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nsoftware  capability targets they are going to achieve over  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years.   Hopefully, by re-orientating  our  focus  on\r\n\r\nsoftware  capability,  making a check on hardware  spending,  we\r\n\r\nwould be able to offer better public services at lower cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is that in the coming years, can we not do\r\n\r\nsomething   to   encourage  inter-Ministry   collaboration   and\r\n\r\ninnovation in the public sector?  We are going to face many  new\r\n\r\neconomic and social challenges in the coming years and  many  of\r\n\r\nthem  will be very different from the kind of challenges we  had\r\n\r\nfaced  in the past.  Take, for example, from an economic  angle,\r\n\r\nour  challenge  to move towards a knowledge-based  economy.   So\r\n\r\nmany  Ministries will have to be involved, whether  it  is  MTI,\r\n\r\nMOM, Education, and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the social front, our challenge is to overcome such issues as\r\n\r\naging  population  and the emergence of an information  society.\r\n\r\nAgain,  many  Ministries will have to be involved in  order   to\r\n\r\nmake sure that the social need, economic issues and so on of  an\r\n\r\naging population are addressed.  The Inter-Ministry Committee on\r\n\r\nthe  Aged  is  a  step in the right direction.  We  have  to  do\r\n\r\nlikewise for the information society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the nation-building point of view, we also have new\r\n\r\nchallenges,  like  the one being addressed by the  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nCommittee,  chaired  by  RAdm  Teo  Chee  Hean,  regarding   the\r\n\r\nstrengthening  of  the heartware of Singaporeans.   Again,  many\r\n\r\nMinistries  have  to  be involved if we want  to  truly  make  a\r\n\r\nquantum leap in strengthening the heartware in the population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point here is that be it knowledge-based economy or\r\n\r\ninformation  society  or aged population  or  strengthening  the\r\n\r\nheartware of Singaporeans,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  these are multi-dimensional issues requiring inter-Ministry\r\n\r\ncollaboration, over a sustained period of time.  If we  want  to\r\n\r\nreally  achieve the kind of outcome we are looking for, we  will\r\n\r\nneed  to  set  clear  targets, assign clear  responsibility  and\r\n\r\nsupport  them with adequate resources.  In other words,  we  may\r\n\r\nhave  to  look into ways of creating a separate budget for  such\r\n\r\ninter-Ministry projects and, hopefully, this new budget will not\r\n\r\nbe  created at the expense of increasing our budget deficit.  My\r\n\r\nsuggestion  is to reduce all Ministries' budget  by  10%.   With\r\n\r\nthat, we will be able to create a fund of about $3 billion.  Put\r\n\r\nthis fund under the direct charge of the Ministry of Finance and\r\n\r\nuse  it to support inter-Ministry projects and collaboration  so\r\n\r\nthat,  over  time,  the issue of knowledge economy,  information\r\n\r\nsociety,  and  so  on, can really be addressed  in  a  concerted\r\n\r\neffort by all Ministries and all civil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I feel that there is also a need to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  new  mindset in the private sector.  Up till now,  we  have\r\n\r\noften heard the business community complaining that the cost  of\r\n\r\ndoing  business  in Singapore is too high and that  we  need  to\r\n\r\nlower cost.  But how low can we go?  At the end of the day, what\r\n\r\nis  the purpose of economic progress if we keep on talking about\r\n\r\ncost cutting, wage cutting, and so on?  Over time, I am not  too\r\n\r\nsure  how  we  can  sustain  our  competitiveness  through  cost\r\n\r\ncutting.  It is quite clear that innovation and adaptability are\r\n\r\nreally  the key if we want to sustain our growth in a knowledge-based economy.  But we have to recognise that process towards  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy is going to be an evolutionary  approach\r\n\r\nand  the  process will take time.  The change management  expert\r\n\r\nwill  tell us that any change process would go through at  least\r\n\r\nfive  stages.   We start with the pioneers, the early  adopters,\r\n\r\nthe  early majority, followed by the late majority and then  the\r\n\r\nlaggard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge for Singapore is not to try to achieve the\r\n\r\nchange   overnight  but  rather  how  we  can  speed   up   this\r\n\r\nevolutionary  approach.  How can we help the early adopters  and\r\n\r\npioneers to succeed in setting the pace so that, hopefully, they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  give encouragement to many more others to come along?   In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, I feel that the off-Budget measures last year  and\r\n\r\nthe  Budget this year have sent a very clear message only to the\r\n\r\nfinancial  community.  The feedback from the business  community\r\n\r\nis  that they are not hearing the same strong message being sent\r\n\r\nto  all the other sectors, whether it is manufacturing or retail\r\n\r\nor communication, and so on.  So my suggestion is this.  Why not\r\n\r\nrevise  all  the incentive packages managed by all the  economic\r\n\r\nagencies  to encourage companies to move towards knowledge-based\r\n\r\ncompanies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I have two suggestions. For companies to be\r\n\r\nknowledge-based companies, firstly, they must be able to develop\r\n\r\ntotal   capabilities,   hopefully  base  their   operations   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    We  have  to  encourage  them  to   deepen   their\r\n\r\ncapabilities  in  individual areas,  whether  it  is  technology\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   market   development,   innovation   development,\r\n\r\norganisation  development  or mass customisation.   In  each  of\r\n\r\nthese areas, obviously we have to encourage them to deepen their\r\n\r\ncapabilities.  But what is even more important is  to  encourage\r\n\r\nthem  to  nurture their capabilities in all these five areas  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  be  able to function truly as  knowledge-based\r\n\r\ncompanies  to be able to respond quickly to market  changes  and\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the existing incentive schemes in\r\n\r\nSingapore   today   are   basically   targeted   at   individual\r\n\r\ncapabilities.   Maybe  it is about time  that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  reviewed  the need on whether we should  repackage  all\r\n\r\nthese  incentive  schemes so that, while on  the  one  hand,  we\r\n\r\nachieve  the deepening of capability objective but, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime, we achieve the broadening capability objective.  Maybe  we\r\n\r\nshould also look into whether there is a need to reorganise  the\r\n\r\nduties and responsibilities of various economic agencies because\r\n\r\nit  is  no longer possible for each of the economic agencies  to\r\n\r\npromote  their  own areas of interest in isolation.   Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  for  any  company which wants to be a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\ncompany, henceforth, when they want to deepen their R&D\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncapability, they talk to NSTB.  When they want to enhance  their\r\n\r\ninnovation capability, they talk to NCB and EDB.  When they want\r\n\r\nto  go into mass customisation, they talk to EDB and JTC.   When\r\n\r\nthey  want to go to market development, they talk to TDB.   When\r\n\r\nthey  want to go to organisation development, they talk to  MOM.\r\n\r\nOver  time, if we continue to let this develop, we are going  to\r\n\r\nlose  our  capability  in  offering one-stop  service  to  these\r\n\r\nleading  investors of the world, whether they are MNCs or  local\r\n\r\nenterprises.   So  I  hope  that  this  is  something  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would think about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area, in promoting the change of mindset in the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  is  that,  for  knowledge-based  companies   to\r\n\r\nsucceed, for them to have this total capability, obviously  they\r\n\r\nhave  to invest more in manpower development.  If I were  to  be\r\n\r\nobjective  about this, today, there are three ways  at  least  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based company can develop their manpower.   The  first\r\n\r\nis  by  retraining their existing workforce.  The second  is  by\r\n\r\ngetting  rid  of  those  who cannot fit  in  and  recruit  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are better educated.  The third is  to  recruit\r\n\r\nforeign  talents.   I  think all three  approaches  are  equally\r\n\r\nrelevant.   But  my point is that, from the company's  point  of\r\n\r\nview,  the cost of redeveloping the existing workforce  is  most\r\n\r\ntime-consuming and, in fact, can be most expensive.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  is  very  important that we do something  to  help  them  to\r\n\r\nbalance  the  cost equation so that it will make business  sense\r\n\r\nfor  companies to reinvest in manpower rather than  to  displace\r\n\r\nthem with younger or foreign talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that what we have to do is to set up a manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment assistance scheme.  When we decided to promote  R&D,\r\n\r\nwe have the Research Development Assistance Scheme (RDAS).  When\r\n\r\nwe  promote  innovation,  we  have the  Information  Development\r\n\r\nScheme  (IDS).   When we want to promote market development,  we\r\n\r\nhave the Market Development Assistance Scheme (MDAS).  Today, we\r\n\r\nwant  to promote manpower development, why not set up a Manpower\r\n\r\nDevelopment Assistance Scheme so that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nall  companies  will  find it to their  commercial  interest  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  manpower  development.  Hopefully,  over  time,  the\r\n\r\ntraining  and  development of knowledge workers  will  become  a\r\n\r\njoint  responsibility of not just the Government and  the  union\r\n\r\nbut all companies as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the third area, which is the people\r\n\r\nsector.   Likewise,  we need to find ways  to  inculcate  a  new\r\n\r\nmindset  in the people sector as well.  We are going to  face  a\r\n\r\nlot  of new challenges in the area of social cohesion as we move\r\n\r\nahead.   In  the past, when we talked about social cohesion,  we\r\n\r\nfocused  on  areas  like,  for example, racial  harmony,  wealth\r\n\r\nsharing,  and so on.  But, in future, there will be  new  issues\r\n\r\nthat would challenge us in terms of social cohesion.  Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample, the potential widening of social gap between the  young\r\n\r\nand  the  old;  the widening of wage gap between  the  knowledge\r\n\r\nworkers   and  the  unskilled  workers;  and  the  widening   of\r\n\r\ncommunication  gap between the connected and the unconnected  in\r\n\r\nthe  population.  The greater inflow of foreign talents and  the\r\n\r\nincreasing number of structurally unemployable Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nadd to social tension as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is: what can we do to further strengthen\r\n\r\nthis  greater  sense  of  caring  and  sharing  in  the  age  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation and technology?  I remember that in the past, when\r\n\r\nwe  wanted to change the mindset of Singaporeans towards  family\r\n\r\nplanning, when we wanted them to go beyond two, to go for  three\r\n\r\nor  four  if  they could afford it, what did we do?  We  offered\r\n\r\nthem  a  whole  host  of  incentives  like  priority  in  school\r\n\r\nregistration.   We  even offered them tax  rebate  amounting  to\r\n\r\n$20,000.   In  fact,  many people said that you  could  actually\r\n\r\nstart  a bigger family to enjoy pioneer status for four to  five\r\n\r\nyears,  and  so on.  Now the question is: at a time  like  this,\r\n\r\nwhen we are going to encounter many more social challenges,  why\r\n\r\nnot consider to provide some kind of incentives to encourage and\r\n\r\nreinforce  some  of these social values which will  help  us  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen our social cohesion in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfuture?   Take, for example, this year, we are going to  give  a\r\n\r\n10%  tax rebate to all taxpayers.  My question is: why not  just\r\n\r\ngive 5% rebate to everyone?  For the other 5% equivalent, we can\r\n\r\nreturn  it  to the taxpayer, for example, in the form of  higher\r\n\r\ntax relief for parents and dependants.  So, hopefully, this will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  send  across the message that the  family  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant building block of society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example. We want to encourage people to continue to\r\n\r\ncontribute to charity and community projects.  Why not give them\r\n\r\ntax allowance just like the way we give investment allowance  to\r\n\r\ncompanies  who  invest  in  capital equipment?   The  difference\r\n\r\nbetween a company investing in capital equipment versus somebody\r\n\r\nwho gives money to charity is, in my view, that one is investing\r\n\r\nfor  economic  return, whereas when giving to  charity,  we  are\r\n\r\ninvesting for social return, ie, social cohesion.  I think  both\r\n\r\nare worth supporting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just some of the suggestions. My point\r\n\r\nbasically  is  that  we can think about how  to  use  all  these\r\n\r\ntaxation  incentives, rebates, and so on, to also  help  reshape\r\n\r\nthe  mindset of Singaporeans so that they will be more aware  of\r\n\r\nthe need to take on a greater sense of social responsibility  as\r\n\r\nwe move ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, 1999 is a golden opportunity for us to\r\n\r\ninculcate  a  new  mindset in all the three \"P\"  sectors  -  the\r\n\r\nPublic  sector,  the People sector and the Private  sector.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to  inculcate this new mindset because, for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nsucceed,  we  need to have many more new change  agents  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  business community and the people  sector,  so\r\n\r\nthat the pace of change will be faster.  It is my hope that,  in\r\n\r\nthe implementation of this year's financial policy, we will send\r\n\r\na  very  clear  signal  to  all Singaporeans  and  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity  that only by constantly reinventing our economy,  our\r\n\r\nsociety  and  our  civil  service,  can  we  become  even   more\r\n\r\ncompetitive  as  a  knowledge  economy,  more  cohesive  as   an\r\n\r\ninformation society and more united as a developed nation in the\r\n\r\n21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for\r\n\r\nthose  of  us who have visited New York City, we may  have  come\r\n\r\nacross  the display of \"The National Debt Clock\" on a wall  near\r\n\r\n42nd  Street  in midtown.  Amongst other things,  it  tells  the\r\n\r\nAmerican  people  how  big  the country's  interest  burden  is.\r\n\r\nApparently,  this  clock  serves  as  a  stern  warning  against\r\n\r\nwasteful Government spending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over here in Singapore, the Government is expecting to\r\n\r\nrecord  a  budget deficit of some $5 billion for  the  financial\r\n\r\nyear  beginning  1st  April 1999 which is almost  11  times  the\r\n\r\nprojected  deficit  of  $466 million for the  current  financial\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time Singapore recorded a budget deficit was during the\r\n\r\ndownturn  in  the  mid-80s.  Since then, we  have  booked  in  a\r\n\r\nsurplus averaging more than $4 billion a year, reaping the  full\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  the boom cycle between 1994 and  1996.   This  has\r\n\r\nenabled  us  to  take a definitive step forward towards  further\r\n\r\ndevelopment of capabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two successive years of budget deficits should not\r\n\r\nbe  taken lightly.  And we note that they are not the result  of\r\n\r\nwasteful Government spending.  Neither are they the result of  a\r\n\r\nbailing  out of the corporate or banking sector but of carefully\r\n\r\nplanned  expenditure  to  help position  Singapore  for  further\r\n\r\ngrowth beyond the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors and Singaporeans alike would have noted that the\r\n\r\ncumulative deficits for FY98 and FY99 will draw down the bulk of\r\n\r\nthe  FY97  reserves,  which have provided adequate  cushion  for\r\n\r\npushing ahead with long-term plans on the one hand and extending\r\n\r\nshort-term  assistance during this crisis on the  other.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult, I do not think investors are asking how we are going  to\r\n\r\nfund these deficits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned 10% jump in development expenditure to $13.9\r\n\r\nbillion  is the strongest demonstration of a commitment  towards\r\n\r\nbuilding  economic capabilities in spite of the current regional\r\n\r\ncrisis.  In the context of a depressed economic region, this  is\r\n\r\nquite a luxury.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this crisis has triggered many structural changes\r\n\r\nwithin  the  region, not least within Singapore, and within  the\r\n\r\nfinancial sector.  Many big corporations have undertaken massive\r\n\r\nrestructuring  towards becoming leaner and meaner organisations.\r\n\r\nIn  the  process,  many have no choice but  to  divest  non-core\r\n\r\nbusinesses or write off substantial sums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deserving businesses caught in a credit crunch have been\r\n\r\nacquired by investors frequently of foreign origin.  There is  a\r\n\r\nquest  towards streamlining operations for better  economies  of\r\n\r\nscale or towards strengthening capitalisation to better position\r\n\r\nfor  a  fast-changing economic landscape.  These  have  inspired\r\n\r\nseveral mergers of corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore is spearheading a bold, but\r\n\r\nnecessary,  blueprint  for changes to the  financial  sector  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  aim  ultimately to  be  a  financial  hub  that\r\n\r\ninvolves  major  players  offering a whole  gamut  of  financial\r\n\r\nservices.   This  has  already spurred the  merging  of  several\r\n\r\nbanks.   There  is  no doubt that the ensuing  consolidation  of\r\n\r\nstrength  will  facilitate the capturing of  a  bigger  role  in\r\n\r\ndomestic and regional banking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to focus on the implications of some\r\n\r\nof   these  changes,  particularly  for  the  small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises (or SMEs) in the short-term, and entrepreneurship in\r\n\r\nthe longer term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As banks consolidate and streamline efficiencies, in the current\r\n\r\nclimate,  there may be a tendency to move in favour of servicing\r\n\r\nthe  bigger  customers.   No  doubt, some  banks  have  actually\r\n\r\ndefined  the middle market as a niche segment but it  is  highly\r\n\r\nconceivable  that  smaller companies may wind  up  being  under-served or poorly-served by the restructured banking system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the SMEs are already feeling the heat of a cashflow\r\n\r\nsqueeze  brought about by a credit crunch.  Many  are  lamenting\r\n\r\nthe  tight, if not fast disappearing, credit terms.   Whilst  we\r\n\r\ncan logically expect banks to exercise prudence at this time, so\r\n\r\nas to minimise the level of non-performing loans, many SMEs are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcerned   that   given   the  massive   restructuring,   their\r\n\r\ntraditional bankers may have abandoned them altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps some of these fears may be exaggerated but this\r\n\r\nraises an important question.  Is it time to revisit the need to\r\n\r\nprovide some form of development financing, similar to the  role\r\n\r\nplayed  by  the  Development Bank of Singapore in our  formative\r\n\r\nyears  of  growth?  Although various assistance  schemes  exist,\r\n\r\nthey  tend  to  cater mainly to manufacturing of electronics  or\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship frequently gets tripped up by a lack of funds.\r\n\r\nBeyond exploring the question of a sustenance of the traditional\r\n\r\nbank  credit or availability of development and financing,  more\r\n\r\nneeds to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, multi-national corporations have\r\n\r\nhitherto been a substantial employer, often offering challenging\r\n\r\njobs  on  attractive  terms.  This has reinforced  the  tendency\r\n\r\namongst  Singaporeans towards being an employee rather  than  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  or  a shareholder.  If this trend  is  allowed  to\r\n\r\npersist  over a prolonged period of time, the paucity  of  home-grown entrepreneurship can only be more pronounced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To nurture entrepreneurship, I believe that the Government\r\n\r\nshould drive the following initiatives:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to define and promote the role of venture capital among the\r\n\r\nSMEs;  help  educate  the  owners and  facilitate  the  matching\r\n\r\nprocess;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) enlarge the investor base beyond the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard  (EDB),  and beyond electronics.  This may entail  working\r\n\r\nwith parties in the private sector; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to design incentives for such investments, such as tax\r\n\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is\r\n\r\ngoing  through  a  very difficult and momentous  period  of  our\r\n\r\nhistory.  Today, we face two issues:  (1) economic; and (2) geo-political.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the economic front, we are in recession while on the geo-political front, we are facing regional political uncertainties.\r\n\r\nThis  budget is packaged in the midst of this economic recession\r\n\r\nand  political uncertainties of the region.  If the  problem  is\r\n\r\npure  economics as in 1985, it is easier, because  we  can  find\r\n\r\nanswers  to economic problems.  But today, because it  is  mixed\r\n\r\nwith   politics,   there   are  too   many   imponderables   and\r\n\r\nuncertainties.  Thus, it was only until recently  that  we  were\r\n\r\nable  to  move  in and out of Indonesia, Malaysia  and  Thailand\r\n\r\nwithout  giving  it a second thought to safety  and  cost.   But\r\n\r\ntoday,  we see a different Malaysia, a different Indonesia,  and\r\n\r\nwe  no  longer visit their countries so frequently, as we  would\r\n\r\nlike to.  It is sad and worrying too because we now see a change\r\n\r\nin  attitude in Indonesia and some of their leaders  are  saying\r\n\r\nthings about us which were never said before.  I would not  want\r\n\r\nto  repeat  what  was said because it serves  no  good  purpose.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Straits  Times  Editorial  of  3rd  March   1999,\r\n\r\nheadlined \"Indonesia Tests Singapore\", reflects the feelings  of\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans.  I would like to quote one of the paragraphs\r\n\r\nin the text:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Indonesia and Singapore remain friends. It is to their\r\n\r\nmutual interest that this be the case.  But friendship must  not\r\n\r\nbe  construed as weakness.  Singapore does no more than state  a\r\n\r\nfact  of  international  life when it  reiterates  the  inherent\r\n\r\nequality  that must continue to underpin relations  between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  countries.  Indonesians must understand that this  is  non-negotiable for Singaporeans\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As political events unfold in Indonesia, we are seeing more\r\n\r\nattitudinal  changes towards us, most of it so far  not  in  our\r\n\r\nfavour.   We  must  therefore be alert, remain  calm  and  react\r\n\r\nrationally and cautiously.  The sad part of it all will  be  the\r\n\r\nslowing  of  trade,  the  curtailing of  investments  into  this\r\n\r\nregion,  the reduction in tourism and the breakdown of  business\r\n\r\nlinks.   This  is a sad time for ASEAN, also Singapore.   Having\r\n\r\nsaid that, we want to wish\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIndonesia  well so that we can avoid further social  unrest  and\r\n\r\nturmoil and enjoy peace.  Peace leads to economic prosperity for\r\n\r\nall.   Malaysia's closure of Clob has affected many  Singaporean\r\n\r\ninvestors.  Many Singaporeans lost money.  Capital control,  the\r\n\r\nAnwar  trial and a changing Malaysian political scene will bring\r\n\r\nproblems  for  our  businessmen.  We hope that  capital  control\r\n\r\nmeasures will not prevent tourism between the two countries, let\r\n\r\nalone  doing  business  there.   For  the  coming  elections  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Malaysia, we can expect more uncertainties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the uncertain geo-political scene as the background,\r\n\r\nwe  have  now  to  take care of our recession.  For  the  second\r\n\r\nconsecutive  year, we have a budget deficit and the  deficit  is\r\n\r\ngrowing from $466 million last year to $5 billion this year.   A\r\n\r\nbudget  deficit would mean having to draw on our reserves  which\r\n\r\nfortunately is not a problem.  Last year, we have come  up  with\r\n\r\noff-budget  measures costing $10.5 billion.  Taken together,  we\r\n\r\ncan  see  that  it is the Government's intention to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nrecession  through  a combination of managing  costs,  upgrading\r\n\r\nskills  and  infrastructure, facilitate access  to  capital  and\r\n\r\npromote investment, especially knowledge driven industries.   To\r\n\r\nbring  relief  to companies and individuals, this budget  offers\r\n\r\nsome  short-term relief to companies and individuals with a  10%\r\n\r\ntax  rebate granted to both categories of taxpayers.  There are,\r\n\r\nincluded  in  the budget, tax changes to further  stimulate  the\r\n\r\nbond  market and fund management industry.  These, together with\r\n\r\nthe  tax  exemption on global OHQs, are part of  the  continuing\r\n\r\ndrive  to reinforce Singapore's competitive position as a centre\r\n\r\nfor financial services and to attract more MNCs into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With unemployment on the rise and cut in workers' CPF, and\r\n\r\nsalaries  in some cases, the 10% rebate on personal  income  tax\r\n\r\nand  rebates  for S&C charges for HDB dwellers as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nrebates  for  utilities would be most welcomed by the  taxpayers\r\n\r\nand   non-taxpayers.    This   budget,   to   many   Singaporean\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, is a non event and it was reported as such by one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  business writers in the Business Times.   As  expected,\r\n\r\nthere were not much goodies left for the businessmen.  But it is\r\n\r\na  cautious budget, not too little or not too much.  And as  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Minister for Finance said in an interview given  to  the\r\n\r\npress,  the Government, if need be, if the recession gets worse,\r\n\r\nwill  take more measures.  I think this is wise - to err on  the\r\n\r\nside of caution.  However, as I said earlier, this budget should\r\n\r\nbe  taken together with the earlier measures given, that is, the\r\n\r\n$10.5 billion package.  It will be more balanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans from all walks of life have in a way been\r\n\r\naffected  by  the downturn in the economies of  the  region  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  beginning to feel and to face  this  economic\r\n\r\ncrunch  beginning this January because January this  year,  they\r\n\r\nsee their take-home pay reduced, their CPF contribution cut, and\r\n\r\ntheir  HDB mortgage loans harder to service.  Then there is  the\r\n\r\nprospect  of  some having to lose their jobs.  For most  non-HDB\r\n\r\ndwellers,  they worry about their obligations to pay  for  their\r\n\r\nhouse  loans,  car loans, children's university education  fees,\r\n\r\nhospital  bills  and  for  the  small  businessmen  hit  by  the\r\n\r\nrecession,  their bank overdrafts, their workers'  salaries  and\r\n\r\nrental for their premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Government, we have to try to respond to their fears\r\n\r\nand  concerns.  We cannot solve each and every individual  case.\r\n\r\nHowever,  at the local ground level, most CDCs must  have  their\r\n\r\nown recession package to help out and, as far as Bukit Timah CDC\r\n\r\nis  concerned, we are beginning to see more and more such  cases\r\n\r\nof  people  who  cannot pay their utilities bills,  kindergarten\r\n\r\nschool fees, flat rentals and of course job requests.  I am sure\r\n\r\nmany  of  us are faced with requests for assistance at  our  own\r\n\r\nmeet-the-people sessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I now come to a frequently discussed\r\n\r\nsensitive subject - recruitment of foreign talent.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in good times, people are more rational, they do not  have\r\n\r\nunemployment,  pay  cut  or CPF cut to cloud  their  minds  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they are more prepared to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccept  our reasons to take in foreigners to increase our talent\r\n\r\npool.  But today, we need to be more sensitive on the issue.  In\r\n\r\nfact, we must tone down the message.  Instead, our emphasis as a\r\n\r\nGovernment  is to reassure them how we take care of  them.   Our\r\n\r\nmessage  to Singaporeans must be clear and loud.  We  will  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to get back the lost jobs.  We will take  care  of\r\n\r\ntheir  basic  needs.  We will give support to  their  children's\r\n\r\neducation  by  increasing bursaries and scholarships.   We  will\r\n\r\nhave  schemes for our citizens to upgrade their skills  training\r\n\r\nand  education and they will get priority over others  including\r\n\r\nPRs.   This  is  a  more important priority  call  than  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent.  I can understand the rationale and need to inject  such\r\n\r\ntalents to our society.  I accept and I support this.  But  many\r\n\r\nstill do not, and especially in this time, such calls make  them\r\n\r\nfeel  threatened.  Bearing in mind that a good  number  of  jobs\r\n\r\nlost  are from the middle management level, I feel that at  this\r\n\r\njuncture, this call for foreign talent might be a bit misplaced.\r\n\r\nLet us think Singaporeans first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the management of this recession does not mean\r\n\r\ndishing  out  rebates but also includes the  management  of  our\r\n\r\npeople's  psyche,  their  fears, their  doubts.   We  must  give\r\n\r\nSingaporeans no quarters as to where our priority lies.  We need\r\n\r\nto  give them a sense of security and keep their morale high  in\r\n\r\norder  that they will work with us to overcome this crisis.   We\r\n\r\nshould not take them for granted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have to emphasise to our people, as we have\r\n\r\nbeen  doing,  why we put so much money on education  and  skills\r\n\r\ntraining  during a recession.  Education's total expenditure  is\r\n\r\n$5.72  billion, up 13.6%.  Many are still not keen on  upgrading\r\n\r\nand  improving their skills.  We want them to feel with us.   We\r\n\r\nwant  them  to  understand why we do this.  We must  impress  on\r\n\r\nthese  Singaporeans that this is to prepare them when the upturn\r\n\r\ncomes.  This is good forward planning and I support strongly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to impress on those reluctant Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  prepare  well, we will overtake  others  fast  and\r\n\r\nwhatever  losses  we have suffered during this crisis,  we  more\r\n\r\nthan  make  up  during a recovery.  We must not  wait  till  the\r\n\r\nrecession ends.  And not many countries in the world can exploit\r\n\r\nan economic downturn in this manner.  We can because we have the\r\n\r\nmeans,  the  know-how and, most important, the  political  will.\r\n\r\nMany years of careful economic policies and strategies can allow\r\n\r\nus  to  be in this position, to use the economic downturn  as  a\r\n\r\nbreather   for  consolidating  and  re-examining  our   economic\r\n\r\nstrategies.   We did the same in 1985.  We took a critical  look\r\n\r\nat  our economic competitiveness and reformed our wage structure\r\n\r\nand because of this, we find easier acceptance this time when we\r\n\r\ndo our cost cutting measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made many strategic moves in the past. We switched\r\n\r\nfrom an entrepot trade to a financial and industrial centre when\r\n\r\nwe  found  that the entrepot trade which we acted  as  middlemen\r\n\r\ncannot  sustain.  Then we went regional.  We wanted an  external\r\n\r\nwing.   We  were not that successful but never mind, failure  is\r\n\r\npart  of  life in doing business.  Now we may have to go  beyond\r\n\r\nour  neighbouring  shores, into Europe, America,  China,  India,\r\n\r\netc.  We will surely find more markets in these areas as we  are\r\n\r\nnot moving into unfamiliar grounds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, our two hinterlands - Malaysia and\r\n\r\nIndonesia   -  are having both economic and political  problems.\r\n\r\nThey  are amongst our biggest trading partners but today,  trade\r\n\r\nbetween  them and us has trickled to a low level.  It is  beyond\r\n\r\nus  to change the outcome of events arising from our neighbours,\r\n\r\nbut whatever happens in both countries affects us.  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  take  an  interest in what is happening in  Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   A  good  grasp  of their political  scenarios  would\r\n\r\nbetter prepare ourselves to handle the regional situation as  it\r\n\r\ncomes.   There have been times when our leaders were put to  the\r\n\r\ntest, and there will be times when our leaders will again be put\r\n\r\nto  the  test.  So long as we have been fair in our  conduct  of\r\n\r\nregional affairs,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  able to enjoy respect and honour.  We  must  stand\r\n\r\nbehind our leaders during such times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  support  of  the Budget Statement  presented  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year this time, when we debated the 1998 Budget, the\r\n\r\neconomic climate was very uncertain.  Unfortunately, since then,\r\n\r\nmany momentous and sweeping events have occurred all around  the\r\n\r\nworld  and  especially in some countries in this region.   These\r\n\r\nevents  had affected us adversely  and will continue to  have  a\r\n\r\nmajor  bearing on how things will develop in the near and medium\r\n\r\nterm.  Our economic outlook is therefore still not any clearer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation is certainly better than even six months\r\n\r\nago.   Many are saying that the worst may be over.  I sense that\r\n\r\nthere are quite a number of Singaporeans in certain quarters who\r\n\r\nare  cautiously  and quietly happy.   They are still  drawing  a\r\n\r\ndecent  income, in a secure job, in a stable or growing industry\r\n\r\nwith little risk of retrenchment.  Interest rates and hence debt\r\n\r\nservicing  costs  are low; property prices and  car  prices  are\r\n\r\nsubstantially  lower  than a couple of  years  back;  the  stock\r\n\r\nmarket has recovered somewhat from its lowest; and airfares  are\r\n\r\nat  an  affordable level.  So, for those who are still  employed\r\n\r\nand  getting  paid  a  decent  and  steady  income,  things  are\r\n\r\nbeginning to look brighter again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before we get carried away and celebrate, we must\r\n\r\nbear  in  mind  Minister  Richard Hu's reminder  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  that  there  are  still  many  uncertainties  in  our\r\n\r\nexternal  environment   -  volatility in  the  global  financial\r\n\r\nmarket,  the  health  of the US economy,  the  prospects  of  an\r\n\r\neconomic  recovery in Japan and the socio-political developments\r\n\r\nin  this region.  Any one of these can unfold very suddenly  and\r\n\r\nunexpectedly  with severe repercussions for those  who  are  not\r\n\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the factors cited by the Minister in\r\n\r\nhis  Budget  Statement,  another  concern  is  China's  economic\r\n\r\nsituation.   I  understand that exports from China are  slowing.\r\n\r\nThere is massive unemployment in the country, mainly as a result\r\n\r\nof  structural reforms to the state economy.  The budget deficit\r\n\r\nis  soaring.   There are concerns about deflation  as  consumers\r\n\r\nbecome more careful and tighten their purse strings.  Some  fear\r\n\r\na  devaluation of the renminbi leading to yet another  round  of\r\n\r\ncompetitive  devaluations by other developing  countries.   Many\r\n\r\ninvestors  are jittery over this issue and have held back  their\r\n\r\ninvestment  commitments in China or have reacted  negatively  on\r\n\r\nany hint of a devaluation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Premier Zhu Rongji has again reaffirmed China's\r\n\r\ncommitment not to devalue and few are predicting instability  in\r\n\r\nthe renminbi exchange rate in the course of this year, I believe\r\n\r\nwe  cannot ignore the developments in China.  Could the Minister\r\n\r\ngive  us his assessment of the Chinese situation and the  likely\r\n\r\nimpact of the developments there on Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against this uncertain backdrop, I fully support the\r\n\r\nneed to focus on the long-term development of our infrastructure\r\n\r\nand  capabilities, while at the same time render some relief and\r\n\r\nassistance  to  those who have been severely  affected  by  this\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's Budget has been described as one with no-frills and even dull. From post-Budget feedback, I found the\r\n\r\nperennial  calls for more goodies to be quite muted  this  time.\r\n\r\nThis  is  quite  different from last year when  a  $2.7  billion\r\n\r\nsurplus  was first announced.  There were accusations  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  not doing enough.  This year, people  are  more\r\n\r\nrealistic  in  the face of a $5.1 billion budget deficit.   They\r\n\r\nappreciate the increase in the personal tax rebate to  10%,  and\r\n\r\nthe  rebates and grants for service and conservancy charges  and\r\n\r\nutilities.   They are also conscious of the external  influences\r\n\r\non  our  economic  well-being, and  understand  the  impact  the\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown  and  the  previously-announced  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures have on Government revenues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what else can or should we do for the individual? I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  offer my views on three issues.   First,  HDB's\r\n\r\nsubsidised  loan rates.  This is on the amount of  interest  HDB\r\n\r\nhome-owners  are  paying  on  their  HDB  subsidised  loans.   I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier  that  interest  rates  and  therefore   debt\r\n\r\nservicing costs are substantially lower now, even when  compared\r\n\r\nto  just  a few months ago.  Most home-owners are happy  as  the\r\n\r\nlower  debt servicing cost has somewhat softened the  impact  of\r\n\r\nthe  reduction in their CPF contribution, ie, most  home-owners,\r\n\r\nexcept  the  vast  majority  of HDB home-owners  who  have  HDB-subsidised  loans.   According to a 5th  March  article  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times, they are currently paying up to  $90  more  than\r\n\r\nunder the non-subsidised rates for every $100,000 of loan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various suggestions have been offered on how the HDB can\r\n\r\nsolve this problem.  But I think the issue goes further than the\r\n\r\nHDB.   It  is  a  financial issue relating to how  interest  for\r\n\r\nCentral Provident Fund deposits is calculated.  The funds needed\r\n\r\nfor  HDB subsidised loans are derived from CPF deposits  with  a\r\n\r\nmargin of 0.1 percentage point.  So, the HDB loan rates have  to\r\n\r\nbe  pegged  to  the CPF deposit interest rate;  otherwise  there\r\n\r\nwould be a mismatch.  And any revision to how the HDB subsidised\r\n\r\nloan interest rate is calculated should originate from revisions\r\n\r\nto the determination of the CPF interest rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the principle of pegging the HDB rate to the CPF\r\n\r\ninterest  rate is fundamentally sound, but the determination  of\r\n\r\nthe  interest rate can be further fine-tuned.  Many of  us  will\r\n\r\nremember  that  a  few months ago, millions if not  billions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  were withdrawn by CPF account holders to take advantage\r\n\r\nof  the higher deposit rates offered by commercial banks.   Now,\r\n\r\nof  course, there is a reverse flow of funds back to the CPF  to\r\n\r\nearn  the  higher interest on CPF deposits.  What this means  is\r\n\r\nthat  these CPF depositors are benefiting at the expense of  HDB\r\n\r\nhome-owners   who  have  mortgage  loans.   This  situation   is\r\n\r\nundesirable  and I hope the Minister would consider measures  to\r\n\r\naddress this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another area which affects the finances of the\r\n\r\nindividual  and  should be reviewed to lessen  the  individual's\r\n\r\nfinancial  burden is stored value cards.  Presently,  there  are\r\n\r\nmany  stored  value cards issued by a multitude of agencies  for\r\n\r\nvarious  purposes   -  MRT fare card for daily  transport,  cash\r\n\r\ncard  for  ERP payments, coupons for parking, phone cards,  etc.\r\n\r\nThis  requires a person to put aside a fairly large sum of money\r\n\r\nto  be  stored in the different cards.  A few dollars  here  and\r\n\r\nthere add up to a lot of money for the average family.  And if a\r\n\r\ncard  is  lost, he has lost cash.  I would like to  ask  whether\r\n\r\nsome  form of coordinated national plan could be implemented  to\r\n\r\nstreamline the different card systems and reduce the  number  of\r\n\r\ncards which the consumer needs to carry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third point on the individual relates to the need to\r\n\r\ntake  time and effort to acquire the requisite skills so  as  to\r\n\r\nremain  relevant  in  our fast-changing world.   Residents  have\r\n\r\napproached  me  during my meet-the-people sessions  to  ask  for\r\n\r\nassistance on employment opportunities.  Very often, I find that\r\n\r\nif the resident is a female, she would ask for a stall, not just\r\n\r\nany  stall but a tuckshop stall in a school because there  is  a\r\n\r\ncaptive  market, and not any tuckshop stall but a  drinks  stall\r\n\r\nbecause the margins are higher and there is less work and skills\r\n\r\nrequired in preparing drinks.  If the resident is male, he would\r\n\r\noften  times  ask  for  a taxi driver's licence  because  if  he\r\n\r\nalready has a driver's licence to drive a private car, it is not\r\n\r\ndifficult to drive a taxi for a living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot be a nation of tuckshop operators or taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers.   Our workers must be encouraged not to take  the  easy\r\n\r\nand   short-sighted   solution  to  their  immediate   financial\r\n\r\nproblems,  but to invest time and energy to upgrade and  acquire\r\n\r\nvaluable new skills that would stand them in good stead  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  the  future.  I believe we need  to  find  out  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why some people are reluctant to go for retraining  and\r\n\r\nskills upgrading, and see if steps can be taken to address these\r\n\r\nproblems specifically.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to the concerns of businesses.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  the introduction of the cost reduction  package\r\n\r\nand  the  benefits  arising  from  the  cost  cutting  measures,\r\n\r\nemployers  are  suffering and saddled with  concerns  about  the\r\n\r\nsurvival  of  their  businesses.   If  their  business  revenues\r\n\r\ncontinue to decline, cutting expenses alone will not be able  to\r\n\r\nturn  it  around.  I therefore welcome the various announcements\r\n\r\nto  help businesses to seek out new markets and expand, examples\r\n\r\nof which are the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme and recently,\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Development Board's $100 million Promising  Local\r\n\r\nEnterprises Investment Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise three points on which we can or\r\n\r\nshould  do  for  local businesses.  One area of  assistance  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses which I hope the Minister would consider is  allowing\r\n\r\nlosses  incurred  by one subsidiary of the group  to  be  offset\r\n\r\nagainst  profits  made  by  another subsidiary.   Following  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  initiative, many companies have  diversified  into\r\n\r\nother  businesses  and expanded into other countries.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthese business units are still profitable while others are  loss\r\n\r\nmaking.    At   present,   our  tax  regulations   treat   these\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries within the same group as separate taxable  entities\r\n\r\nand  losses  in  one  cannot be used to reduce  the  profits  in\r\n\r\nanother.   The  corporate  tax rate of  26%  on  the  profitable\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries  is  a heavy burden on the whole  group,  as  these\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries will have less ability and resources  to  help  the\r\n\r\nother  non-profitable  companies within the  same  group.   This\r\n\r\nwould increase the pressure to shut down unprofitable operations\r\n\r\neven  though  they  have good long-term  prospects.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister   consider  allowing  companies  to  file  consolidated\r\n\r\nreturns  as  is  done in the UK and the United States?   Even  a\r\n\r\ntemporary relief would be most helpful to these companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to touch on our high-tech ventures.\r\n\r\nIn  the  arena  of new technological developments,  no  one  can\r\n\r\npredict  with certainty how things will turn out in  future  and\r\n\r\nwhich  technology will succeed.  Out of the many  technopreneurs\r\n\r\n\"born\" every day, only some of them will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhit  the  big time and be winners.  We should therefore  promote\r\n\r\neven more entrepreneurs to start up companies and the Government\r\n\r\nshould  exercise more flexibility in assisting and incentivising\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this area, the Government has established a number of\r\n\r\ntechnology  and venture funds, the latest initiative  being  the\r\n\r\n$100 million fund for Promising Local Enterprises.  However,  my\r\n\r\nfear is that while the objectives of these programmes are noble,\r\n\r\ntheir  success  depends, firstly, on the people  who  administer\r\n\r\nthese  funds  and,  secondly, on the  other  efforts  which  are\r\n\r\nrequired to bring the product to the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether an investment is made or a grant is approved\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the people who evaluate the project and  administer\r\n\r\nthe  programme.   They should not simply focus  on  the  product\r\n\r\nunder  development and pass judgment on whether  it  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  the future or not. Such a top-down, inflexible  and\r\n\r\nhighly  prescriptive approach is inappropriate  and  potentially\r\n\r\nharmful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In high-tech, it is not merely investing in the technology\r\n\r\nper   se,  but  more  importantly,  in  the  people  behind  the\r\n\r\ntechnology because even if the present intention does  not  take\r\n\r\noff  and fails, the true entrepreneur will pick himself up,  and\r\n\r\ntry  again  and again until he succeeds.  The administrators  of\r\n\r\nthe  programme  must  therefore have  the  ability  to  identify\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs who have ideas, creativity, imagination, integrity\r\n\r\nand the determination and drive to make it big.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, the people who administer these funds must\r\n\r\nthemselves  possess  some  of these attributes.   Alternatively,\r\n\r\nthese  funds  should be used to seed a broad  range  of  budding\r\n\r\nstart-up companies and hope that some of them will succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the success of a product does not depend merely on\r\n\r\nhow  good  it  is  but  also  on its  promotion,  marketing  and\r\n\r\ndistribution.  The 3M Post-it Notes, first conceived by Art Fry,\r\n\r\ndid not become an instant success but took many years of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhard  work  before  it gained popular acceptance.   When  I  was\r\n\r\npursuing  my Physics undergraduate degree in the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nabout  20  years  ago, my professor told me  that  although  the\r\n\r\nBritish  were  good  scientists  and  researchers,  it  was  the\r\n\r\nAmericans   who   were  better  at  realising  innovations   for\r\n\r\ncommercial applications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, great innovations do not sell by themselves. In\r\n\r\naddition  to financing to promote innovation, we must also  fund\r\n\r\nand  assist the commercial exploitation of these innovations and\r\n\r\ndevelop them into great products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point on businesses relates to some of our\r\n\r\ntraditional   industries.   Although  I   am   advocating   more\r\n\r\nassistance  to  be  given  to entrepreneurs  to  start  up  more\r\n\r\nventures  in  technological development, I believe  a  different\r\n\r\napproach should be taken to restructure and consolidate some  of\r\n\r\nour low-tech businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One common complaint among businessmen is that everybody is\r\n\r\nundercutting  and lowering prices even to the extent  of  losing\r\n\r\nmoney on specific projects just to keep its workers occupied and\r\n\r\nstay  in  business.  The question is how long can  this  go  on.\r\n\r\nBesides, undercutting is not necessarily good for the consumers.\r\n\r\nIt  does  not  mean that cheaper means better value  for  money;\r\n\r\nundercutting  of  prices may bring about a  decline  in  quality\r\n\r\nstandards and a greater risk of default and non-performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many sectors, for example, construction and retail, the\r\n\r\nlocal turf is over-crowded and over-saturated.  There are simply\r\n\r\ntoo many local players fighting among themselves for a piece  of\r\n\r\nthe   local  market.   Malaysia,  Indonesia  and  Thailand,  the\r\n\r\ntraditional  overseas  markets  for  these  small   and   medium\r\n\r\nenterprises have been badly affected and these companies have no\r\n\r\nchoice but to beat a hasty retreat to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present market environment, if left to the natural\r\n\r\ncourse of the economic cycle and pure market forces alone, there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill   be  a  blood-bath  and  a  lot  of  suffering  and   lost\r\n\r\nopportunities before the survivors eventually emerge.  More  may\r\n\r\nbe  out  of  business  resulting in  a  greater  loss  of  jobs.\r\n\r\nEveryone will end up the loser, either dead, half-dead or dying.\r\n\r\nEven hitherto strong companies, after fighting among themselves,\r\n\r\nwill  be depleted of vital energy.  They will have less strength\r\n\r\nto face foreign competition and future competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should therefore facilitate the\r\n\r\nrestructuring and consolidation in some of these industries, not\r\n\r\nby force, but by good sense accompanied by the strong persuasive\r\n\r\npowers of grants and incentives.  Bosses, being bosses, will  be\r\n\r\nreluctant  to be taken over to merge or to form joint  ventures.\r\n\r\nThey  must  be  encouraged to cooperate with others  for  shared\r\n\r\nresources, for synergy and for economies of scale. The worldwide\r\n\r\ntrend  is  towards  bigger,  leaner and  stronger  companies  to\r\n\r\ncompete  effectively, if not globally, then at least regionally.\r\n\r\nOnly   then  can  we  have  the  critical  strength  to  compete\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  in  the  face  of changing  classic  business  and\r\n\r\neconomic paradigms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lots of opportunities out there for grabs. This\r\n\r\nis  an  opportune time to capitalise on our strengths and  build\r\n\r\nworld-class   multi-nationals.   Other  small   countries   have\r\n\r\nsucceeded.  The Swiss control major international pharmaceutical\r\n\r\ncompanies.   The  Netherlands has oil giant Shell  and  Philips;\r\n\r\nFinland  has Nokia; Sweden, Ericsson. We can build our own  true\r\n\r\nmulti-nationals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the financial policy presented by the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Budget this year\r\n\r\nhas  been  described by the press as a non-event.  I  think  the\r\n\r\npress looks to it as a non-event because of the lack of measures\r\n\r\nthat  were needed to give a stimulus to the economy.   That  has\r\n\r\nbeen  done in the two cost-cutting measures.  The first was  the\r\n\r\n$2  billion package announced by the Minister in June 1998,  and\r\n\r\nthe  second  was introduced in November that year when  a  $10.5\r\n\r\nbillion package was presented in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nParliament  by  DPM Lee.  Those cost-cutting  measures  and  the\r\n\r\nmeasures  announced  in the Budget are not expected  to  give  a\r\n\r\nboost   to  the  economy  to  any  significant  recovery.    The\r\n\r\nprediction  is that GDP for FY99 shall either have a  growth  of\r\n\r\nonly plus one percent or a shrinkage of minus one percent.   The\r\n\r\nsituation  of the economic downturn is not expected  to  improve\r\n\r\nmarkedly  because  the  problem is not  internal  but  external.\r\n\r\nInternally, Singapore is said to have done whatever it needs  to\r\n\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1985 recession, what Singapore needed to turn the economy\r\n\r\naround  was simply to cut down costs and the following year  and\r\n\r\nsubsequent  years saw business picking up.  Foreign  investments\r\n\r\nalso started to flow back to Singapore.  But this time round the\r\n\r\nrecession is not due to our lack of competitiveness but  due  to\r\n\r\nexternal factors, one of which is the collapse of the economy of\r\n\r\nthe  countries in the region.  Even should Indonesia be able  to\r\n\r\nget  its economic infrastructure in order, business may not pick\r\n\r\nup because of the serious social and political problems there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is supposed to hold its general election in June\r\n\r\nthis  year, but it may be postponed.  Civil unrest is still rife\r\n\r\nin  that  country.  Every country in this region hopes that  the\r\n\r\nJune  election  will be held as planned and  goes  on  smoothly.\r\n\r\nThen  a  legitimate Government can be elected with a mandate  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out the measures to restore the economy.  We in Singapore\r\n\r\nwish  Indonesia and its people well.  We all hope that Indonesia\r\n\r\ncan  get  its  politics in order and that peace  is  once  again\r\n\r\nrestored  to that country and its people be given an opportunity\r\n\r\nto rebuild its economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stark reality of this recession is that it has taught\r\n\r\nSingaporeans a valuable lesson, ie, relying only on  traditional\r\n\r\nmethods  of  overcoming the recession do not work.  Cost-cutting\r\n\r\nto  make Singapore more competitive and pump-priming in the past\r\n\r\nwere  able to get Singapore out of the recession.  But this time\r\n\r\nround those methods alone are not able to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recession also saw the drastic drop in value of the East-Asian currencies against the American dollar. Goods and\r\n\r\nservices  appeared to be oversupplied. However, it  is  observed\r\n\r\nthat despite these problems, Taiwan's economy is not affected to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  as  other East-Asian economies are  affected.   The\r\n\r\ndifference between Taiwan and the other East-Asian countries  is\r\n\r\nthat  Taiwan  has embarked on a programme of giving  its  people\r\n\r\nmore democracy and more freedom.  That, I believe, is the key to\r\n\r\nits resilience against this round of recession.  That country is\r\n\r\nable  to  show  a  high level of creativity, innovativeness  and\r\n\r\ninitiative.   Taiwan is able to produce the goods  that  despite\r\n\r\nthe  competitive market is able to sell those goods in  America.\r\n\r\nIts  business  people are also dynamic.  The people  there  have\r\n\r\nleadership qualities and are able to build a network  and  break\r\n\r\ninto the American market and push the sale of their goods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas in Singapore, our business people, though through long\r\n\r\nyears  of paternalistic Government, are like lumbering dinosaurs\r\n\r\nwaiting  for the Government organisations like the EDB, TDB  and\r\n\r\nother  trade  bodies to get things done for them.  Our  business\r\n\r\npeople  lack  the  individual courage, drive and  initiative  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own  to push and seek out markets for themselves.    They\r\n\r\nappear to be waiting for the Prime Minister, the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nor  DPM  Lee  to  show  the way for them  through  their  visits\r\n\r\noverseas.   In  normal times, our style of doing business  seems\r\n\r\nall right.  But as the world gets more competitive, and at times\r\n\r\nlike  this  when the recession sets in, it is the extra  quality\r\n\r\nthat  our business people should have but are lacking which will\r\n\r\nmake the difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to advocate to the Government again is that the\r\n\r\npolitical style of governing Singapore needs to be changed.  The\r\n\r\npeople  must  be  given more political space  to  develop.   The\r\n\r\npeople  must  be given more freedom to develop their  leadership\r\n\r\nand  entrepreneurship qualities and need to be  given  a  bigger\r\n\r\nsay.   For  a  start,  the  Government should  consciously  tell\r\n\r\nMinisters and Members of Parliament not to take part or lead  in\r\n\r\nany  public committees, for example, the cost-cutting committee.\r\n\r\nAllow the business\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople   to   deliberate  on  their  own  and  make  their   own\r\n\r\nrecommendations  without  Ministers  or  Members  of  Parliament\r\n\r\noverseeing them.  Business people and their Chambers of Commerce\r\n\r\nshould  be  given lots of leeway to take the lead in identifying\r\n\r\nthe problems affecting the economy of the country and be allowed\r\n\r\nto  form  public committees to deliberate entirely on their  own\r\n\r\nand to put forward recommendations rather than, like the present\r\n\r\ntime,  the  Government appears to be the only one who is  taking\r\n\r\nthe  lead and business people meekly agreeing and following what\r\n\r\nthe   Government   has  recommended.   I  know  Ministers   will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  rebut  what  I say but the  fact  is  that  whatever\r\n\r\nparticipation business people in Singapore seems to be  involved\r\n\r\nin, the Government always has full control of the proceedings of\r\n\r\nwhatever public committees and has the final say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to touch on another area. The Government, in\r\n\r\nevery   Budget  Statement,  does  not  fail  to  preach  against\r\n\r\nwelfarism.   The Budget Statement this year specifically  states\r\n\r\n\"We must resist the temptation to allow ourselves to succumb  to\r\n\r\nthe  lure of welfarism.\"  On the one hand, the Government  warns\r\n\r\nus  against  succumbing to practices of welfarism  but,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, at the constituency level it is doing the opposite.\r\n\r\nAt Potong Pasir, Mr Andy Gan, the prospective PAP candidate goes\r\n\r\nfrom  house to house handing out sums of $200 to each family  in\r\n\r\ncases  where the head of the family is out of job for  at  least\r\n\r\none  month.   He  also  hands out $5  vouchers  to  families  to\r\n\r\npurchase grocery. Mr Andy Gan is acting like a Father Christmas,\r\n\r\ngoing from household to household, handing out public funds.  He\r\n\r\nsays  that  the  funds  are  from  the  Potong  Pasir  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Council (CDC).  I presume that it  must  be  either\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  money or money contributed by the  public.   In  any\r\n\r\nevent,  what I am saying is that the official position  is  that\r\n\r\nthe Government does not encourage welfarism but, in reality,  it\r\n\r\nis practising welfarism in its most raw form,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  is,  giving  away money freely, of  course,  where  it  is\r\n\r\npolitically advantageous to the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I see the disbursements of money to the HDB flat\r\n\r\ndwellers in the so-called rebates on the Town Councils'  service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy charges and the HDB monthly rentals as outright\r\n\r\npractices  of  welfarism.  The only difference in the  welfarism\r\n\r\nthat  is practised in Singapore and those practised in the  West\r\n\r\nis  that  in  Singapore's  case, the money  given  away  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is targeted for vote catching, but those in the  West\r\n\r\nare  done  as  a matter of right if one meets the criteria.   As\r\n\r\nregards  the  amount of rebates given to HDB  flat  dwellers,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that  the Government should be more generous.   They\r\n\r\nshould, in fact, double it, because I am to a certain extent for\r\n\r\nwelfarism,  because  you must have compassion  for  the  people.\r\n\r\nThere  were about 28,000 of our workers, as reported,  who  were\r\n\r\nretrenched  last  year.  I believe it is a further  20,000  this\r\n\r\nyear who will be retrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my 15th year in Parliament. Year after year, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  budget  shows  ever-increasing  surpluses.   I  have\r\n\r\nspoken  out  against the policy of ever accumulating more  money\r\n\r\nfor  the Government which only means that the people shall  have\r\n\r\nless money and consequently less savings.  But this year, I  see\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  a  budget  deficit  of  $5.1  billion  in   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  account.  I do not think that the Government  needs\r\n\r\nto  be  apologetic or be ashamed of it.  Hong Kong, I  see  this\r\n\r\nyear,  also has a deficit account.  I believe this is the second\r\n\r\nyear  of budget deficit in Hong Kong.  In Singapore's case,  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  has accumulated surpluses in its term of office  and\r\n\r\nprobably  it has nothing to worry.  In fact, I say that although\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  stand  is not to overdraw  on  surpluses,  it\r\n\r\nshall, as I say, do so when the necessity arises.  Just like its\r\n\r\npronouncement  on refusing to cut workers' CPF which  eventually\r\n\r\nit did.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the motion in the name of the Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is almost a non-event, as described by\r\n\r\nmany.   This is because of the two off-Budget measures  in  June\r\n\r\nand  November  last year when packages of $2 billion  and  $10.5\r\n\r\nbillion worth of cost-cutting measures were announced.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese measures announced will only be effective from this fiscal\r\n\r\nyear.   It is understandable, therefore, that we must give  time\r\n\r\nto  these  measures  to work its way through the  system  before\r\n\r\ndeciding  on  whether we need new measures, and if so,  in  what\r\n\r\nform,  and for what purpose.  Nevertheless, I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister what kind of time-frame would be necessary for  us\r\n\r\nto see whether these measures work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, this Budget in March is more like a routine one\r\n\r\nto  approve  the expenditures for the Government Ministries  and\r\n\r\ndepartments to function smoothly.  There are not many major  tax\r\n\r\npolicy  changes,  except  for some for  the  financial  services\r\n\r\nsector  to  encourage and promote the bond  market,  dealing  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  securities, syndicated facilities and boutique  fund\r\n\r\nmanagement.   There  are  also a few tax incentives  for  global\r\n\r\nOHQs,  contract  manufacturers and traders, and  exhibition  and\r\n\r\nconference organisers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some companies and businesses as well as\r\n\r\nindividuals  are  in  financial hardship  during  this  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  in many ways, I feel this period of testing  is  good\r\n\r\nfor  us  and  holds many valuable lessons.  The  last  recession\r\n\r\nbetween  1985  and  1987  was  rather  short  and  many  people,\r\n\r\nespecially  the young, have either forgotten or not  even  known\r\n\r\nwhat  a recession is.  There was so much of euphoria in the last\r\n\r\n10   years  that  many  have  taken  economic  growth  and  good\r\n\r\ngovernment  for  granted.  Many have now learnt  painfully  that\r\n\r\nasset  prices  that go up can also come down.   This  must  also\r\n\r\napply  to what we see in the US markets today, which is  why  we\r\n\r\nare  a bit nervous about the consequences of a downturn on Asia.\r\n\r\nBefore this recession, there was so much job hopping during  the\r\n\r\ndays  when  the labour market was very tight that  many  workers\r\n\r\nnever bothered to upgrade themselves or stay long enough in  one\r\n\r\njob to master their craft or trade well.  Such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers  are  most  affected in this recession.   This  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  in  the  region  has also shown  us  how  important  the\r\n\r\npolitical   and  economic  stability  and  prosperity   of   our\r\n\r\nneighbours are to our very own economic prosperity. It has  also\r\n\r\nhighlighted to us how fragile our markets are, and how important\r\n\r\nit  is for us to venture further afield to new markets so as  to\r\n\r\nbroaden our market base and enhance our economic stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage is now set for economic recovery this year and\r\n\r\nthe  next.  It is important, indeed critical, that our  policies\r\n\r\nand systems should provide the foundation for the next phase  of\r\n\r\neconomic growth.  In this respect, I am pleased to note that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  identified correctly the main  crucial  issues,\r\n\r\nnamely,   to  maintain  the  framework  for  continued  economic\r\n\r\nactivity;  secondly, to help companies tide over the crisis  and\r\n\r\nminimise    unemployment    and   enhance    capabilities    and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness for future growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to dwell a little bit more on helping\r\n\r\ncompanies survive this downturn.  Many local companies have been\r\n\r\nhard  hit by the sudden and drastic decline in demand for  their\r\n\r\ngoods and services from the region.  Many of these companies are\r\n\r\nnot  new  and small ones.  Some of the ones I know of have  been\r\n\r\noperating for more than 10 years.  Nevertheless, they are  still\r\n\r\nin  trouble and under grave pressure, especially from the  banks\r\n\r\nthat  have reduced their credit lines.  Worse still, some  banks\r\n\r\nhave  even  withdrawn  those  very bank  lines  vital  to  their\r\n\r\nsurvival.  Although the Government has said that they would like\r\n\r\nto  leave  credit  assessment  totally  to  the  private  sector\r\n\r\nfinancial   institutions,  we  must  remember  that  these   are\r\n\r\nextraordinary  times, probably the worst since our independence,\r\n\r\nand hence we may need extraordinary measures to help these local\r\n\r\ncompanies  from  folding under.  Many jobs are  at  stake.   Our\r\n\r\nobjective  of strengthening the base of local enterprises  would\r\n\r\nalso be set back by quite a few years if the Government does not\r\n\r\nextend  a helping hand.  I know the EDB has the Local Enterprise\r\n\r\nFinance Scheme (LEFS) as well as a scheme to co-invest in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npromising   local  enterprises  to  help  them   enhance   their\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and growth.  However, the schemes are  limited  in\r\n\r\nscope as not many of these companies in trouble can make use  of\r\n\r\nthem.   Given  the current situation, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  any new measures can be  introduced  to  help\r\n\r\ntroubled  local  companies that currently  do  not  qualify  for\r\n\r\neither one of these two schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FY 1999 will yield a budget deficit of $5.1 billion. Given\r\n\r\nthe severity of this current economic downturn, this deficit  is\r\n\r\nnot  really  alarming.  This deficit is only  the  size  of  our\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus in a fairly good year.  In fact, I would say  it\r\n\r\nis  commendable that at a time like this, there is still no need\r\n\r\nfor  this  Government  to draw upon the  reserves  of  the  past\r\n\r\nGovernment.   The  Government's budgeting has always  been  very\r\n\r\nprudent,  yielding substantial surpluses and  reserves  in  good\r\n\r\nyears.   At  a time like this, Singaporeans begin to  understand\r\n\r\nand  appreciate our prudence much better, although  I  have  not\r\n\r\nchanged my stand that in good years, we still have to be careful\r\n\r\nnot to suck too much money out of our system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on some specific tax issues in greater\r\n\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Corporate Tax</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago, the Government stated that its long-term\r\n\r\ntarget  corporate tax rate is 25%.  We are now still at 26%.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Minister whether we still maintain  this\r\n\r\nlong-term  target rate of 25%, and if so, when  do  we  plan  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this long-term target rate.  Would this year not  be  a\r\n\r\ngood year to do this in order to help investors achieve a better\r\n\r\nreturn on their investments?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Incentives for Businesses Going Abroad</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the current decline in demand for goods and services from\r\n\r\nthe region, because of this economic crisis, companies have been\r\n\r\nasked  to venture further afield to tap new markets.  As we  all\r\n\r\nknow, marketing can be expensive,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nespecially in faraway markets.  I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider  giving  more tax incentives for  companies  to  go\r\n\r\nmarketing overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Grouping for Property Developers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised this issue of allowing property developers, who\r\n\r\nare  now required by law, to set up a new company for every  new\r\n\r\nproject,  to  allow  them to group profits and  losses  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of tax reporting.  It seems a bit unfair that tax has to\r\n\r\nbe accounted for on a project by project basis.  Other companies\r\n\r\nnot  compelled by law to set up new companies for every line  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  can  do  so  now, irrespective of  the  size  of  each\r\n\r\nbusiness.   I believe there is some anomaly here that should  be\r\n\r\naddressed.   I  hope  the Minister will  look  again  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Waiver of Stamp Duty for Property Transactions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that the property market seems to have\r\n\r\nstabilised.   However, one impediment to a smooth and  efficient\r\n\r\nmarket  is  the stamp duty for property transactions.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister to consider waiving the  stamp  duty\r\n\r\nuntil  further  notice  in  order to help  the  property  market\r\n\r\nrecover further.  In the November 1998 cost-cutting package, the\r\n\r\nstamp  duty  on  contract  notes  for  share  transactions   was\r\n\r\nsuspended  and will now be extended by another year.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthe  rationale for such suspension is similar for  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Property Tax Rebate.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the 55% property tax rebate is only extended to\r\n\r\ncommercial  and industrial properties.  Is there any reason  why\r\n\r\nit  should  not  be  extended  also to  residential  properties?\r\n\r\nOwners of such residential properties have also been hard hit by\r\n\r\na   very   soft   market  for  rentals  that  have   come   down\r\n\r\nsubstantially.   A rebate will help such owners tide  over  this\r\n\r\ndifficult period and survive the downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Goods and services tax</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail and tourism sectors have been very hard hit by\r\n\r\nthis economic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndownturn.  In fact, the retail sector has been very weak  for  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of years.  Our retailers are not competitive,  not  only\r\n\r\nbecause  of the high rentals and wages, but also partly  because\r\n\r\nof the Goods and Services Tax.  I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider  lowering  the GST at  this  time  to  2%.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant to keep the GST mechanism in place.  A cut of 1% would\r\n\r\nnot  impact the revenue collection too much, but would go a long\r\n\r\nway in helping restore confidence in the retail sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Personal Income Tax Reliefs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the onset of this economic crisis, unemployment is\r\n\r\nrising.   The Government is encouraging more workers to  go  for\r\n\r\nskills upgrading and redevelopment.  To give further emphasis to\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of lifelong learning and skills upgrading,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  decided to raise the tax deduction  for  actual\r\n\r\nexpenses incurred by individuals for such upgrading from  $2,000\r\n\r\nto  $2,500,  an  increase of $500.  While the  gesture  is  much\r\n\r\nappreciated, I must point out that very few courses qualify  for\r\n\r\nsuch  tax deduction.  I would like to ask the Minister to  relax\r\n\r\nthe  criteria  on the type of academic and professional  courses\r\n\r\nthat  would  qualify for such tax deduction.  For  many  of  us,\r\n\r\nupgrading  may  not  be  by formal courses  that  will  lead  to\r\n\r\ndiplomas,  certificates or any other professional qualification.\r\n\r\nIn  this  IT age, many of us would like to upgrade ourselves  in\r\n\r\nthe IT area through more informal courses, but such expenses  do\r\n\r\nnot qualify for tax deduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Personal Tax Rate</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with my call for the Government to consider adopting the\r\n\r\nlong-term  corporate tax rate of 25%, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to do likewise for the long-term maximum personal  tax\r\n\r\nrate of 25%.  We are still 2% away from this target.  This would\r\n\r\nmake  us  more competitive vis-a-vis Hong Kong and  help  us  to\r\n\r\nposition  ourselves as a more attractive centre for finance  and\r\n\r\nother commercial activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to you for\r\n\r\ngiving me this opportunity to speak in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even in times of a buoyant economy, it is not an easy\r\n\r\ntask  for the Minister for Finance to present a balanced Budget.\r\n\r\nThe task is more difficult in times of recession.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthe Minister has presented a very pragmatic Budget.  There is  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  of  $5.1  billion  and, as Mr  Chiam  has  pointed  out\r\n\r\nearlier,  I  do  not think the Government has to  be  apologetic\r\n\r\nabout  it.   Its  prudent policy in having  surplus  has  to  be\r\n\r\nchanged.    This  is the time when the country  needs  the  $5.1\r\n\r\nbillion, and I think the Government has done the right thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must credit the political leadership for presenting\r\n\r\nthis  Budget.   But there is another institution which  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to pay tribute to and that is the civil service.  An honest\r\n\r\ncivil  service  has made Singapore proud.  It is very  important\r\n\r\nfor   us  to  maintain  this  integrity  because  the  political\r\n\r\nleadership  cannot  survive unless we have  a  very  strong  and\r\n\r\nhonest civil service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have rightly not cut our expenditure on defence,\r\n\r\neducation and social service.  Without a good defence,  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  no security and, without security and political stability,\r\n\r\nwe  will not have foreign investments.  We are fortunate in this\r\n\r\nbecause,  looking  at our neighbours, investors  know  where  to\r\n\r\nchoose.  Similarly, in order to create the manpower for the next\r\n\r\ncentury, we must spend our money wisely on education.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nlife-long  learning process and we must strive not to stinge  in\r\n\r\nthis area.  I am glad that the Government has been very generous\r\n\r\nand it should be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we as a people can take pride that, despite job\r\n\r\nretrenchments,  loss  of  business and  a  not  very  favourable\r\n\r\neconomic  condition, we have maintained our social cohesiveness.\r\n\r\nIt is times like this that we can test the people's will, and we\r\n\r\ncan pride ourselves, and we hope that even in a worse situation,\r\n\r\nwe can take the same stand.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a likelihood that more jobs will be lost this\r\n\r\nyear.  I appeal to the Government to take care of those who will\r\n\r\nbe  losing  their  jobs.  We must see that the families  do  not\r\n\r\nsuffer  because the breadwinner has no job, the children do  not\r\n\r\nmiss  school  and that they have textbooks and the amenities  of\r\n\r\nlife  to  keep  them  going.  It is the  responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  the people as well to help those who  are  going\r\n\r\nthrough  this difficult period.  But, eventually, the Government\r\n\r\nmust  take  the  leadership.   Once  the  Government  takes  the\r\n\r\nleadership, the people themselves will follow through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my earlier colleague, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, has\r\n\r\npointed  out,  the  situation in Indonesia  is  difficult.   The\r\n\r\nIndonesian people are going through a difficult period.  We hope\r\n\r\nthings will change for the better after the election.  Singapore\r\n\r\nwishes  Indonesia  well because a buoyant economy  in  Indonesia\r\n\r\nwill  help  us  and we have every reason to see  that  Indonesia\r\n\r\ncomes through the difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area I am a little worried is the economy in\r\n\r\nChina.   I  do  not  know what is going to be in  store  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Perhaps, the Minister may be in a position to enlighten\r\n\r\nthis House.  Should the situation change for the worse in China,\r\n\r\nwhat would be the repercussion on the Singapore economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other area which I would like to share my concern\r\n\r\nis  the property sector.  Sir, so much of our citizens' money is\r\n\r\ntied  in  the  property market and it is worrying that  property\r\n\r\nmarket  values are going down month by month.  Most  people  who\r\n\r\nbuy  properties in this country have borrowed from the banks and\r\n\r\nwe  have yet to see what is the exposure of the banks should the\r\n\r\nproperty  market  go  down any further.  In certain  areas,  the\r\n\r\nproperty  market is going at half price.  May  I  plead  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to study the market and to plan in such a  way  that\r\n\r\nthe  property  market does not collapse.  I am  not  asking  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to bail out those who have speculated.  But there are\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  have  genuinely bought  property  for  their  own\r\n\r\noccupation, while\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  may have bought for investment.  It is only fair that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intervenes when the property goes up  and  when  the\r\n\r\nproperty  goes down, it should see that it does not go  down  to\r\n\r\nsuch a state that it will affect the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are proud of the Government's record that it has\r\n\r\nbuilt  houses  through the Housing and Development  Board.   But\r\n\r\nthere  are  certain sectors of the community that  need  private\r\n\r\nhouses  and  their need has to be planned and  looked  after  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the economic recession, people are very\r\n\r\ncautious as to how they are going to spend.  Even those who have\r\n\r\nthe  money  tend  to  be  very cautious and  this  can  be  very\r\n\r\ncounterproductive.  If there is not enough money in the economy,\r\n\r\nit  will  be  self-defeating because it is important, especially\r\n\r\nfor the retail sector, to have money in the economy.  We have to\r\n\r\nsee  how  we  can pump some money into the economy so  that  the\r\n\r\nretail  sector will not be affected because many people tell  me\r\n\r\nthat  some  of  them are having such a hard and difficult  time.\r\n\r\nThey find it very difficult to keep their business going.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our tourist sector is also affected. It is very\r\n\r\nimportant  for  us  to  see how this area is  not  affected  any\r\n\r\nfurther.   Our hotels and restaurants are all tied up with  this\r\n\r\nsector.   It is very important for us because tourists  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  our neighbouring countries.  As a result of that,  we\r\n\r\nare also affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to repeat that, if there\r\n\r\nshould be a need in future, the Government should be prepared to\r\n\r\ndraw  on  its  reserves.   I  am not  asking  that  we  withdraw\r\n\r\neverything  that  we  have kept.  If there is  a  necessity,  we\r\n\r\nshould be prepared to draw on the reserves and help our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to say a few words on Mr Chiam's\r\n\r\ncomments.   Hong Kong is as free a market as one  can  get.   If\r\n\r\nwhat Mr Chiam said that economic progress\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsolely depends on the so-called democratic system is true,  then\r\n\r\nHong  Kong should do much better than Taiwan.  I do not want  to\r\n\r\ncomment  on how Hong Kong is doing.  Even Mr Chiam can  see  it.\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam is being too simplistic and naive in generalising such\r\n\r\na complex subject of economics in such a shallow manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many have described the Finance Minister's Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  as  a  non-event, as expected, or even  boring.   But\r\n\r\nnotably, hardly anyone has expressed disappointment.  Unlike  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam,  it is because everyone has come to expect the Government\r\n\r\nto  take  a prudent and long-term view when faced with a  crisis\r\n\r\nand  therefore share a sense of confidence towards  this  year's\r\n\r\nBudget Statement.  Most Singaporeans agree that this is not  the\r\n\r\ntime  to  over-react, but rather to act sensibly and  purposely.\r\n\r\nIn  the end, the right policies, carried out with determination,\r\n\r\nwould ensure that perseverance will prevail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while the population is comfortable with the macro and\r\n\r\nlong-term strategies, there is a feeling of deep concern at  the\r\n\r\nmore  micro  and individual levels.  Many are faced with  short-term  financial  problems.  For individuals, the possibility  of\r\n\r\nretrenchment  looms over most employees.  Company-wise, many are\r\n\r\nstruggling  to  stay  afloat.  Although the off-Budget  measures\r\n\r\nhave to a great extent helped, 1999 would be a real test.  While\r\n\r\n1998's  performance  was  not good, many  businesses  are  still\r\n\r\nbuffeted by the spillover businesses of the better years of 1996\r\n\r\nand   1997   and  are  managing  to  survive  on  the   reserves\r\n\r\naccumulated.  By now, they would have depleted this reserve  and\r\n\r\neven  if the economy should turn around, as generally predicted,\r\n\r\nmany may not be able to ride through the next two rough years of\r\n\r\n1999 and 2000 to enjoy the recovery.  Therefore, the Government,\r\n\r\nhaving  put  in  place all the strategies  and  points  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of the economic upturn when it comes, should  address\r\n\r\nthe  short-term difficulties these individuals as  well  as  the\r\n\r\ncompanies are facing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no quick fix to these problems and it is not\r\n\r\nexpected of the Government to guarantee every company's survival\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  find a job for each and every individual.  The cost cutting\r\n\r\npackage  and,  significantly,  the  introduction  of  the  Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise Finance Scheme have to a certain extent given hope to\r\n\r\nmany  SMEs  and local companies to survive.  But the  Government\r\n\r\ncan  still do more to assist those who are affected to tide them\r\n\r\nover this difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can ease the pressure of competition from many\r\n\r\nGLCs  on  the local enterprises.  I am not suggesting that  GLCs\r\n\r\nshould  give concession to local businesses.  But many of  these\r\n\r\nGLCs,  whose original objective is to mainly compete in overseas\r\n\r\nmarkets  and  to  spearhead the building  of  the  second  wing,\r\n\r\nsomehow  became  very aggressive and competitive  in  the  local\r\n\r\nmarket.   Although we have always been assured that they compete\r\n\r\non a level playing field, somehow the perception is that because\r\n\r\nthey  have such superior strength, in terms of human as well  as\r\n\r\nfinancial resources, they can kill off any private company  they\r\n\r\nchoose  to  compete with, especially during these trying  times.\r\n\r\nThe decision by JTC to suspend most of their industrial building\r\n\r\nprojects  in  the next few years so as to ease the  over  supply\r\n\r\nsituation  in the industrial property market is a  move  in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction.  This will give some breathing  space  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate developers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the recession, the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  has  indicated that as  a  result  of  accelerating\r\n\r\neducation  programmes, many new schools would have to  be  built\r\n\r\nand  that  they  will  be farmed out to the private  consultancy\r\n\r\nfirms  to  do.   Sir, I want to declare myself as  a  practising\r\n\r\narchitect.  But to-date, I was informed that few, if any, of the\r\n\r\nfirms  have  received such commission even though  the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation  has  deteriorated  rapidly.   Perhaps,  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould speed up the process instead of holding back.  All  these\r\n\r\ndecisions  will  help  towards easing  the  difficult  situation\r\n\r\nsomewhat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the individual, the projected unemployment figure is not\r\n\r\nencouraging.    Last  year,  there  were  a  total   of   28,300\r\n\r\nretrenchments and this year's figure is projected at, at  least,\r\n\r\n20,000 and that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunemployment  figure will be higher because this does  not  take\r\n\r\ninto  account  the  new  entries to  the  workforce  each  year.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there are many avenues where financial assistance  can\r\n\r\nbe   obtained   -   from   MCD,  CDCs  and  various   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations, of course, from Andy Gan - however, more  can  be\r\n\r\ndone.   For example, HDB has been very amicable in restructuring\r\n\r\nmortgage  payments, some from 15 to 20 years  longer.   In  most\r\n\r\ncases,  HDB  also allows the owners to pay instalments  for  the\r\n\r\narrears   they  owe.   However,  if  the  sole  breadwinner   is\r\n\r\nretrenched,  he  or she would have no income and  therefore  the\r\n\r\nabove  concession  would not solve their problem.   Perhaps,  in\r\n\r\nsuch cases, HDB can consider suspending payment for a period  of\r\n\r\ntime  until  these  flat owners can meet their obligation  after\r\n\r\nthey have been re-employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retrenchment problem is not confined to the lower\r\n\r\nmiddle income group.  Many of those retrenched are professionals\r\n\r\nor  executives.  They are likely to have a sizeable account well\r\n\r\nabove  the Minimum Sum in the CPF and because of their temporary\r\n\r\nsetback,  they may not be able to meet their mortgage obligation\r\n\r\non  their  homes  or their children's education.   I  would  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  the Government will consider for this period only,  and\r\n\r\non  a case-by-case basis, whether a portion of their CPF can  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  for these two particular purposes so that they  would\r\n\r\nnot  inadvertently  lose  their  own  properties  or  having  to\r\n\r\nterminate their children's education, especially those who  have\r\n\r\nchildren studying overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by moving away from the economic\r\n\r\naspect  of  the Budget Statement.  For decades now, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  spent  much  energy and placed much emphasis  on  economic\r\n\r\nprogress.  Even with the crisis, Singapore is one of the leading\r\n\r\nexamples of how a nation can achieve economic success and  bring\r\n\r\na   better   life   to   her  people  under   most   challenging\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  But in doing so, we have lagged behind  somewhat\r\n\r\nin the development of our culture,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  arts  and  other intellectual pursuits such  as  music  and\r\n\r\nliterature.   Understandably so, perhaps  this  period  of  slow\r\n\r\ngrowth  will give us an opportunity to catch up in this area  of\r\n\r\nour national development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most western countries, especially in Europe, have gone\r\n\r\nthrough periods of economic recession and even depression.   But\r\n\r\nsomehow,  the  population  spirit and  morale  have  never  been\r\n\r\nseverely  hampered.   I  think it is  because  during  times  of\r\n\r\nadversity,   they  can  turn  their  attention  to  other   less\r\n\r\nmaterialistic  aspects of their life and derive  much  enjoyment\r\n\r\nand  inspiration in the arts, music and literature.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nin   the  field  of  arts,  with  all  the  great  masters  like\r\n\r\nMichelangelo  da  Vinci,  Picasso,  and  in  music   they   have\r\n\r\nBeethoven,  Wagner,  Strauss.  They also have  great  poets  and\r\n\r\nwriters  like Shakespeare, Keats, Tennyson.  The list  goes  on.\r\n\r\nThese countries have thousands of years of history, culture  and\r\n\r\ntradition  behind them and that enabled them to find  fulfilment\r\n\r\nin  the  intellectual and spiritual fields even in the  face  of\r\n\r\nsevere economic hardships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we should seek this opportunity of the slowdown\r\n\r\nto  intensify the promotion of the arts, stimulate our awareness\r\n\r\nof  the richness in the less materialistic aspects of our  life.\r\n\r\nOur  Government, especially the Ministry of Information and  the\r\n\r\nArts,  should  intensify its programmes to promote our  cultural\r\n\r\npursuit,  organise more art activities, concerts and  dramas  to\r\n\r\nstimulate the intellectual inspiration in us.  We should promote\r\n\r\nour local artists and writers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are usually overwhelmed by the pace of our economic\r\n\r\nprogress.   Perhaps, it is timely for us to turn  our  focus  on\r\n\r\ncultivating  a more gracious society, something we  have  always\r\n\r\nbeen  aiming to achieve, instead of always being branded as  too\r\n\r\nrigid and materialistic.  More importantly, when confronted with\r\n\r\nsuch  economic adversity, we could have something else to  focus\r\n\r\non,  to draw inspiration from.  Otherwise, our whole world  will\r\n\r\njust  collapse  around  us  if we only  live  for  our  material\r\n\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent news from our neighbouring countries is not\r\n\r\nencouraging,  especially in Indonesia.  The cautious  optimistic\r\n\r\nprediction  of our economic crisis being bottomed  out  may  not\r\n\r\nmaterialise.   The volatile situation can explode  suddenly  and\r\n\r\nSingapore may inadvertently be right in the middle of  it.   The\r\n\r\ncomforting sign is that we have weathered this crisis well as  a\r\n\r\nnation  and  that there is no reason for us not to be  confident\r\n\r\neven  if  things get worse that our Government would be able  to\r\n\r\nlead us through the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Chen has accused me of having a\r\n\r\nshallow thinking.  I would like to ask Mr Chen whether or not he\r\n\r\nthinks  that  Singapore needs a qualitative change to  give  its\r\n\r\npeople  more political space, more freedom to develop  qualities\r\n\r\nof creativeness, initiative and leadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, I do not want to enter into\r\n\r\na  lengthy debate with Mr Chiam.

I was saying\r\n\r\nthat  conditions have changed and the situation has changed now,\r\n\r\nand  we need to change at the same time.  I gave the example  of\r\n\r\nTaiwan.   Taiwan has changed to more democracy and more freedom,\r\n\r\nand that is probably why it is so resilient now.  It has managed\r\n\r\nto  make things more innovatively that can be sold in America in\r\n\r\ncompetition with the other low-wage countries.  I am saying that\r\n\r\nSingapore should also need a qualitative change.  Does he  agree\r\n\r\nwith me?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, I have given the example of\r\n\r\nHong Kong.  If he wants another example, it is Russia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  giving  me this opportunity to speak.   To  answer  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam,  perhaps he has not lived through the days of  the  Great\r\n\r\nDepression in the United States where the greatest democracy  of\r\n\r\nthe world was having great unemployment and hunger and people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nqueuing  up  for  food.  So does it mean that because  you  have\r\n\r\ngreat   democracy,  therefore  your  economic   situation   will\r\n\r\nnecessarily be the better?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must first proceed to address the motion by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance.  I welcome the caution of the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nin  his  Budget speech.  Such a caution, delivered with  a  $5.1\r\n\r\nbillion  deficit,  is  to be welcomed after  so  many  years  of\r\n\r\nsurpluses that the Minister had delivered in this House.  And it\r\n\r\nis  quite likely that with a CPF cut of 10% and a $10.5  billion\r\n\r\ninjection into the economy through competitive cuts in  November\r\n\r\n1998  which,  it is estimated, can add to about $2 billion  into\r\n\r\nour  economy this year, there is good chance for the economy  to\r\n\r\nmove around.  The cut in the CPF of 10% can mean an injection of\r\n\r\nabout 5-6% to the economy.  Why do I say that?  Wages constitute\r\n\r\nabout  60%  of the GDP.  If you have a 10% cut of the  wage  all\r\n\r\nround, there is likelihood that there can be a 5-6% injection in\r\n\r\nthe  economy.  Add to the $2 billion competitive cost cuts  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  and last year's $10.5 billion, a turnaround  therefore\r\n\r\ncan  be  expected.  But as the Minister said, barring unforeseen\r\n\r\nregional or international disturbances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a famous Economist Herbert Stein, who was one\r\n\r\ntime  advisor to the US President, and he said, \"What cannot  go\r\n\r\non  forever  must stop.\"  And I have just noted that  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister just mentioned in Australia about the great bubble that\r\n\r\nis going on in the United States.  Perhaps, Mr Chiam should wait\r\n\r\nhis  time  to see what will happen.  There are great  unforeseen\r\n\r\ninternational  and regional disturbances that can really  affect\r\n\r\nwhatever  plans  we  have, even now that we are  moving  towards\r\n\r\nsteering  our economic towards a turnaround.  Even the necessary\r\n\r\nconditions in our own domestic economy, we must make  sure  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  effects  we  are introducing in the  economy  must  be\r\n\r\nfiltered  down  so that everybody down the line in  the  economy\r\n\r\ngets  a  part  of  the  share  in  this  cost-cutting.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cuts statutory costs and only the landlord  makes  a\r\n\r\ngain  by  saving the cost but not filtering it down to the  sub-tenants, the economy is going to face\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  lot  of  difficulties because down the line small  businesses\r\n\r\nwill continue to face such difficulties.  To make sure that such\r\n\r\ncost-cutting  measures that we do filter down the line  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.   How to do so is something I believe the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  try  as  best  as  possible  to  monitor  what  are  the\r\n\r\nimplications of many of these statutory costs on the  businesses\r\n\r\ndown the line and to see what kind of redress they can have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must also ensure that whatever cost and price\r\n\r\ncut  that  we  have must boost consumer and investor confidence.\r\n\r\nWhenever there is a price-cut or saving in wages, there is also,\r\n\r\non the other side of the coin, a tendency towards a recessionary\r\n\r\nspiral.   So  we must balance the two.  It is like a  fine  edge\r\n\r\nthat  we  must balance and Government must somehow  manage  this\r\n\r\ntask.  Consumer and investor confidence must be ensured so  that\r\n\r\nat  the end of the day, our export competitiveness will also  go\r\n\r\nhand in hand with this consumer and investor confidence to build\r\n\r\nback the growth in the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to address this topic on our foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  rate which is an important policy instrument.   I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  Minister  for  Finance  in  his  responses   in\r\n\r\nParliament  at  various times to be quite  ambivalent  or  vague\r\n\r\nabout this foreign exchange rate policy instrument.  It is quite\r\n\r\nacceptable for the Minister for Finance to say that  we  do  not\r\n\r\nmanage our exchange rates because we are an open economy.  But I\r\n\r\nwould  say that even in spite of this, the fact that our economy\r\n\r\nis  very  open  and that there is a great need  for  import  and\r\n\r\nexport,  there is possibly some scope for some foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nleeway  rate  movement.  A cheaper Singapore dollar can  attract\r\n\r\ncapital,  a  capital account in the balance of payments  through\r\n\r\npeople coming in to buy up assets.  A lower Singapore dollar can\r\n\r\nalso  operate through our goods and services sector where export\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness can be built up and the whole impact of all this\r\n\r\nwill  be essentially on affecting our money supply which at  the\r\n\r\ntime of potential recessionary spiral is something that we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  not forget to look at.  So, while we are reducing  costs\r\n\r\nand reducing income, we must also drive exports and spending.  I\r\n\r\nsee  that  this exchange rate variable therefore is an important\r\n\r\nfactor, and it should not be left only to the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $5.1 billion deficit in this current Budget should not\r\n\r\nbe viewed as too alarming.  After all, we have had many years of\r\n\r\nsurpluses  and  reserves have been built up and  a  considerable\r\n\r\npart  of  this  deficit spending is in the area  of  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Yet, I must point out that the growth rate of  our\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure over the last three years from  FY  1997\r\n\r\nto  FY  1999 is actually slowing down.  We should also be  aware\r\n\r\nthat  the leakage component of our development spending  can  be\r\n\r\nquite  high  because of the open nature of our economy.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthe  multiplier effect of our Government budgetary  stimulus  is\r\n\r\nmuch  smaller than what these figures are wont to show.  So,  we\r\n\r\nalso  have  to  be aware of the limitations of fiscal  spending.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I see this role of trying to balance fiscal  spending\r\n\r\nwith our foreign exchange rate policy quite important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the regional financial difficulties, our private\r\n\r\nsector  has  seen  a  significant part of  its  assets  diminish\r\n\r\nthrough stock and property collapse or business failures.  While\r\n\r\ncompanies  are struggling to repair their balance sheets,  there\r\n\r\nis  a  significant reduction in the wealth effect of our private\r\n\r\nsector  in  the economy.  This reduction in the wealth component\r\n\r\nof  our economy can lead essentially to a down-turn in spending.\r\n\r\nI  think  this  is  an  important  element  that  we  must  look\r\n\r\nspecifically.   We  can  see  now  the  diminished  demand   for\r\n\r\nrestaurant services, for boutiques, for cars and in the property\r\n\r\nmarket.   So we need to give back as much as possible  to  drive\r\n\r\nthe  private economy to repair back its spur and to create  back\r\n\r\nthe wealth that has diminished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans today are poorer than they were 1-2 years ago.\r\n\r\nSo  we  welcome  the  various  schemes  that  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nhighlighted  of  efforts by the Government to  redress,  through\r\n\r\nupgrading of various skills training programmes for our people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  workplace in order for them to get on to higher skilled\r\n\r\njobs to earn the income that they require.  Various training and\r\n\r\ngrant  programmes  exist today, the skills development  training\r\n\r\ncentres,  for example, run by the ITE and other skills  training\r\n\r\ncentres. I would urge that a skills training scheme or programme\r\n\r\nthat can attract more private sector effort be studied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various grants or voucher payment schemes can be devised\r\n\r\nfor  modular training programmes that can be run by the  private\r\n\r\ncompanies  which can use their facilities and their  plants  for\r\n\r\nvarious modules of the training programme.  The Government  body\r\n\r\ncan  then  concentrate more on administering  these  programmes,\r\n\r\ntheir  certification and tests.  With this more flexible system,\r\n\r\nwe  can  train the kind of people that we need for  the  private\r\n\r\nsector economy, so that it could be more dynamic by engaging the\r\n\r\nright  type  of  people.   With a more flexible  private  sector\r\n\r\noriented training scheme which I hope can be developed soon,  we\r\n\r\ncan expedite this important need for training and development in\r\n\r\nour economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Minister in his motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the hon. Member has taken a pot\r\n\r\nshot  at  me.  He said that America had a deep recession.   That\r\n\r\nwas  in 1929-1933.  I think we all know about that.  Taking  the\r\n\r\nyear  1933, it was 66 years ago, and I believe America, being  a\r\n\r\ncountry where there is freedom, people make studies and come out\r\n\r\nwith  all  kinds  of theories.  I think now they understand  why\r\n\r\nthere was a recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to the Prime Minister, he made a\r\n\r\nprediction that the bubble will burst.  But soon after  he  made\r\n\r\nthat  prediction, the Dow went up 200-over points and now it  is\r\n\r\nin its 92nd month of its uptrend.  Of course, anything that goes\r\n\r\nup  will come down.  This is easy to say.  But the point is that\r\n\r\nit  is  still holding strong.  And the reason why it  can  reach\r\n\r\nthat  point  is because America is so great and because  it  has\r\n\r\ncreativity.   It makes a film and it earns US$500 million.   Can\r\n\r\nSingapore earn that kind of money?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the point that we really want to\r\n\r\naddress  out   of  Mr Chiam's statement is: does  it  mean  that\r\n\r\ndemocracy will bring more economic growth?  I think this is  the\r\n\r\nbig  issue  that we have to look at.  I just pointed out   about\r\n\r\nthe  depression that happened in the US economy.   They  were  a\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  But why then did this thing happen?  So we have  got\r\n\r\nto  look at the issue more in depth and not just say because  it\r\n\r\nis  Hong  Kong  or  Taiwan  with more democracy,  therefore  the\r\n\r\neconomy is resilient and we are not resilient.  I think there is\r\n\r\nsomething to it that we must challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, speaking in Singapore's context, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  Singapore  has reached a stage  where  the  people  are\r\n\r\nalready  educated enough.  We have reached a high level  of  per\r\n\r\ncapita  income and I think it is time for us to make  a  quantum\r\n\r\nleap to get us to a higher level of development, producing value\r\n\r\nadded  goods that are involved with IT, goods that are  involved\r\n\r\nwith  knowledge and Singapore can then be as rich as one of  the\r\n\r\nwestern  nations, and not competing with Indonesia and the  rest\r\n\r\nof the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\neffects  of  the economic crisis and financial turmoil  in  this\r\n\r\nregion  are  reaching into the economic field.  The  economy  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is no longer enjoying more and more good years as said\r\n\r\nby  the PAP in the last elections.  This year's Budget will have\r\n\r\nmore  than $5 billion in deficit.  Actually, this $5 billion  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  true  deficit, because our estimated  revenue  is  $24.1\r\n\r\nbillion and operating expenditure is $15.2 billion.  So if we do\r\n\r\nnot  include  the  development expenditure,  there  will  be  no\r\n\r\ndeficit of $5.1 billion as played up by the media.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  because of the increase in the development expenditure.\r\n\r\nIf  we maintain the development expenditure to the 1997 level of\r\n\r\n$9  billion, there is no need to touch our accumulated reserves.\r\n\r\nHowever,  from the macro economic point of view and  the  future\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of our country, we should make use of the  time  of\r\n\r\nthe  downturn  to prepare for a better take off in  the  future.\r\n\r\nAlso, at the same\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime,  we  can  help  the  people to  tide  over  the  difficult\r\n\r\nsituation.    From the economic policy point of  view,  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment has all the time, whether the economy is good or bad,\r\n\r\neven when people are suffering from unemployment and the economy\r\n\r\nis  in  recession, not been prepared to use fiscal  measures  to\r\n\r\nlighten  the burden of the people.  Regrettably, the economy  is\r\n\r\nnow  facing great problems and people are facing great  pressure\r\n\r\nand the Government is not lowering the charges but is continuing\r\n\r\nto increase water tariffs, refusing to repeal the GST and do not\r\n\r\ncare  about the people's survival and they continue to  tax  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called rebates on HDB rentals and S&C charges and so on\r\n\r\nare  to alleviate and to cushion the hardship caused by the GST.\r\n\r\nRebates  on  utilities bills are to offset  the  impact  of  the\r\n\r\nincreases  in  water tariff.  The \"Special SC/CC rebates\"  which\r\n\r\nwill  last for a year and announced at the budget this  year  is\r\n\r\nonly  a  symbolic  concern  shown  by  the  Government  to   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people affected by this economic crisis.  This\r\n\r\nis only in real terms $2-$6 compared to the cost cutting measure\r\n\r\nimplemented  by  the Government.  The workers' wages  have  been\r\n\r\nreduced by more than 10% and their incomes have been reduced  by\r\n\r\nmore  than  $2-$6.   Now, when there are more  and  more  people\r\n\r\nbecoming  unemployed,  with $2-$6 to  help  people,  is  it  not\r\n\r\nridiculous?  Can I ask:  what can this $2-$6 rebate do for  such\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the present economic crisis and the difficulties faced by\r\n\r\nthe  people, I am reminded of the year 1997 when the PAP brought\r\n\r\nup  the platform to say with confidence that it would be able to\r\n\r\nachieve  5-7% growth every year and to create more  wealth,  and\r\n\r\nthis  was  the  main plank in the platform of the  PAP  for  the\r\n\r\nelections.   Generally speaking, the people  do  not  have  more\r\n\r\nwealth.  Instead, because of the downturn in the property market\r\n\r\nand  the share market, their assets will not appreciate but they\r\n\r\nhave  also  lost  a lot of money.  And the so-called  subsidised\r\n\r\nloan obtained by the people have to pay higher\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterest than the commercial banks.  The share ownership  scheme\r\n\r\nhas   become  a  share  losership  scheme.   Worst  still,   the\r\n\r\nunemployed  people and the business losers are facing bankruptcy\r\n\r\nand  are in a helpless state.  The PAP should apologise  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Budget, to help the business community, I think the\r\n\r\nGovernment is unfair.  They pay special attention to look  after\r\n\r\nthe  financial community and big companies, and to provide money\r\n\r\nmaking  companies a lot of rebates and special tax tariffs,  tax\r\n\r\nconcession  and  so  on and so forth and  to  be  exempted  from\r\n\r\ncertain  taxes  like  GST.  But to the small  and  medium  sized\r\n\r\nenterprises, the Government has not given any specific  measures\r\n\r\nto help them tide over the present difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what we must pay attention to is that there is a\r\n\r\nspecial  feature  in  the Budget that the  Government  wants  to\r\n\r\nprovide for $125 million to provide for some new programmes.   I\r\n\r\nfeel, in principle, that all kinds of provisions must be clearly\r\n\r\nstated   for   their  objectives.   And  without  the   specific\r\n\r\nobjectives  and  it wants Parliament to give  the  provision,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it should be debated in this House before it is approved.\r\n\r\nI want to ask the Government how we are going to use this money,\r\n\r\nwhat  kind of services will it be spent on.  Otherwise, this  is\r\n\r\namounting to giving them an open cheque of $125 million from the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This is not prudent and is against the  spirit  and\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  Parliament scrutinising and debating  the  budget\r\n\r\nbefore it is approved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, we must look at the people's difficulties from\r\n\r\nthis  present  situation.   In the good  times,  the  Government\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  tax the people and to accumulate surpluses.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  times are bad, the Government continues to tax the  people\r\n\r\nbut  to  help the people it is only giving $2-$6.  On the  other\r\n\r\nhand, the media is playing up to say that it is alleviating  the\r\n\r\nburden  of  the  people.  I can say that,  to  use  the  Teochew\r\n\r\nphrase, it is good looking but it is useless.  All that glitters\r\n\r\ndo not shine!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

However, this year our economy  has  been\r\n\r\nhit  by the financial crisis in the region, and we have a budget\r\n\r\ndeficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Hougang said that our deficit this year\r\n\r\nis not a genuine deficit.  To me, a deficit is a deficit.  There\r\n\r\nis  no such thing as genuine or not genuine.  If you have a bank\r\n\r\naccount and you  spend  more than what you have in your account,\r\n\r\nyou run into a deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing worth mentioning is that there are not many countries\r\n\r\nwhich can still increase education and defence expenditure  when\r\n\r\nimpacted  by a financial crisis.  Singapore can.  While  we  are\r\n\r\nmoving towards a knowledge economy, we  increase our expenditure\r\n\r\non  education and training so as to look after the  interest  of\r\n\r\nour  workers to ensure their life-long employability. At a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  our  neighbouring countries are facing turbulent political\r\n\r\nunrest,  we  increase our defence spending.  This  is  something\r\n\r\nwhich everyone in Singapore can understand.  Our deficit is  not\r\n\r\none  of consumption type.  It is a development expenditure.   In\r\n\r\nthe long run, it will enhance our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just now, the Member for Hougang said that the PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  should apologise to the people.  In fact,  over  the\r\n\r\nlast  one  to two years, our political leaders, from  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  to the Ministers, and from the labour MPs to the  NTUC\r\n\r\nleaders,  have been explaining to our people  the impact of  the\r\n\r\neconomic   crisis  on  us,  and  that  many  people   may   face\r\n\r\nretrenchment  and  unemployment.  We have worked  very  hard  to\r\n\r\nexplain  to our people the problems that we would be facing  and\r\n\r\nall  the  external factors that would have an adverse effect  on\r\n\r\nus.   The  people understand.  When the crisis hit us, they  did\r\n\r\nnot  ask us for an explanation.  Nobody has asked the Government\r\n\r\nto  apologise.  We were able to implement the CPF reduction  and\r\n\r\nwage  cut  without a hitch. The foreign media were amazed.  They\r\n\r\ncould not understand how we managed to carry out such a delicate\r\n\r\nexercise  so smoothly, and with hardly any  resistance from  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Hougang also said that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  not care  whether the people live  or  die.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask how many people had died  because  of  this\r\n\r\ncrisis.   On  the contrary, the PAP Government has  shown  great\r\n\r\ncare  and concern for the people.  Our leaders have been  making\r\n\r\ndoor-to-door visits to the  residents and anyone found to be  in\r\n\r\nhardship,  assistance will be on hand to help him out.   We  are\r\n\r\nhelping  our  people when help is most needed by them.  This  is\r\n\r\nlike  sending hot-burning coal to a freezing person in the snow.\r\n\r\nI  think if the Member for Hougang cares to make a visit to  our\r\n\r\nPAP constituencies he will understand what we are doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said that this Budget is \"good to see but not good to\r\n\r\neat\".   In Chinese, there is a saying that good medicine may  be\r\n\r\nbitter to the taste but it cures your sickness.  In a way, he is\r\n\r\nright.  This Budget may not be \"good to eat\", but it heals.   So\r\n\r\nit is good medicine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Potong Pasir tried to link democracy\r\n\r\nwith  economic prosperity.  If the superpower USA is hit  by  an\r\n\r\neconomic crisis, can he then  say that there is no democracy  in\r\n\r\nthe United States?  I do not know how he came to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconclusion that Taiwan is more democratic than we are.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nhe  was  referring to  newspaper reports on how Parliamentarians\r\n\r\nfought  in  Parliament.  They even went up to  the  Speaker  and\r\n\r\nthreatened  him.   Such  an  incident  will  never   happen   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Is that what he meant when he said Taiwan  was  more\r\n\r\ndemocratic than Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam should know that our economic situation is different\r\n\r\nfrom  that  of Taiwan.  In our economy, 73% comes from  external\r\n\r\ndemand;  12% from domestic consumption, and 12% from investment.\r\n\r\nBut  Taiwan  is different.  Their market is mainly confined   to\r\n\r\nEurope, the United States and mainland China.  They are  not  so\r\n\r\nmuch affected by the regional crisis.  I hope the next time when\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam wants  to make such a remark, he should pay a visit to\r\n\r\nTaiwan  first.   I  do not know how many times  he  has  visited\r\n\r\nTaiwan (twice or three times or never?). He should go there  and\r\n\r\nfind  out for himself what the actual situation is.  Take a look\r\n\r\nat  the  Philippines.  They are supposed to be very  democratic,\r\n\r\nbut is their economy better than ours?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this crisis, many people are beginning to realise that they\r\n\r\nneed  to  go  for training, retraining, and skills upgrading  in\r\n\r\norder to enhance their employability.  However, I feel that  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector seems to be \"half-a-beat behind\" in the promotion\r\n\r\nof  training  plans  for its staff.  Now  with  many  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  corporatised or privatised,  very often  the  staff\r\n\r\nhave   to   be   transferred  to  the   other   departments   or\r\n\r\norganisations, and many of their existing skills  could  not  be\r\n\r\nutilized.   So,  I  feel that we should speed  up  the  training\r\n\r\nprogramme  in the public sector so that more civil servants  may\r\n\r\nbenefit.   I  also  feel that the Government should  allot  more\r\n\r\nfunds for training so that every Singaporean could benefit  from\r\n\r\nthe training and be geared to face the challenge of transforming\r\n\r\ninto a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong remarked that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  were  not  so good in singing,  unlike  our  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncounterparts.  At many public functions, when asked to sing, our\r\n\r\nSingapore  officials had nothing in their repertoire, and  ended\r\n\r\nup  singing   Majulah Singapura.  But nowadays, I   notice  that\r\n\r\nmost  Singaporeans can sing at least one or two songs.   One  of\r\n\r\nthe main reasons is that in all our RC centres there are karaoke\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Perhaps we could make use of these RCs to encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to go for continuing learning by conducting various\r\n\r\ncourses at the RC centres.  For those training courses which  do\r\n\r\nnot  involve the use of large apparatus or equipment, they could\r\n\r\nbe  conducted  at  the  RC centres for the  convenience  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.   At  the  same  time, ITE and the various  polytechnics\r\n\r\nshould  also conduct more part-time courses so that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  are  willing  to  learn could have  more  opportunities  to\r\n\r\nimprove  themselves. The admission criteria can be  relaxed,  so\r\n\r\nthat  more  Singaporeans  can qualify  for  admission  to  these\r\n\r\ncourses,  and  work for some sort of diploma.   Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nstudents  must attain a certain standard in the course of  their\r\n\r\nstudies before they can be awarded the diploma.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this year onwards, many Singaporeans have accepted a\r\n\r\n10% CPF reduction and their salaries were also reduced by 5%-8%.\r\n\r\nI  think  this is a very good manifestation of the Singaporeans'\r\n\r\ntrust  of  our Government.  Our people are beginning to  realise\r\n\r\nthat they have to go for training.  Because if they do not, they\r\n\r\nwill  be  in  trouble.  This crisis has made this  problem  more\r\n\r\nacute.   Just now, Dr Tan Cheng Bock  mentioned that  Government\r\n\r\nshould  be  very cautious and  tone down our efforts to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  talents.   He was right and I agree  with  him.   As  a\r\n\r\nmember   of   the   Singapore  21  Committee,  with   particular\r\n\r\ninvolvement   in  the  sub-committee on  attraction  of  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents,  I  fully agree that we should be cautious  in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  this  matter, so that we would not make Singaporeans  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the foreigners are coming here to take over our jobs.   We\r\n\r\nshould  explain  to our people that when  the foreign  investors\r\n\r\ncome, they set up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnew  establishments  and create more job opportunities  for  our\r\n\r\npeople.   When the foreign workers come, they take up jobs  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  could not do or do not want to do.   They  do  not\r\n\r\nactually deprive us of our job opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the good years, we have good economic growth and the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been giving a lot of rebates to our people.  That\r\n\r\nis  to share happiness with our people.  It is something good to\r\n\r\neat.  However, there are many successful Singaporeans who do not\r\n\r\nneed such rebates.  Even in this difficult time, not everyone is\r\n\r\naffected.   In fact, many Singaporeans are still enjoying  life.\r\n\r\nThey  are  still having a good life.  Therefore, I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should review our rebate policy.  For those  who\r\n\r\ndo  not  need  such rebates, they can choose to donate  them  to\r\n\r\ncharitable  organisations.  In fact, in this economic  downturn,\r\n\r\nthe  charitable organisations are having problems raising funds.\r\n\r\nOur  successful Singaporeans are generally very generous.   They\r\n\r\nwill  be  willing to donate their shares of the rebates  to  the\r\n\r\ncharitable  organisations,  and  by  so  doing,  the  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations will greatly benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those who are facing difficulties, the rebates given by\r\n\r\nthe Government are giving them a shot in the arm.  With the help\r\n\r\ngiven by the CDCs and the town councils,  many Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nbeginning  to feel the care and concern given to them  by  their\r\n\r\ncommunity organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the NWC recommendations have already been\r\n\r\nimplemented   this   year  in  order  to   restore   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   There are signs that the economy  is  turning\r\n\r\nfor  the better.  However, our measures of wage restraint should\r\n\r\nbe  continued  so  that we can ensure that we still  retain  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   I  think the most  important  thing  is  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should actively take up training courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one thing I am concerned with, and although\r\n\r\nmany companies and property owners have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenjoyed   the  various rebates given to them by the  Government,\r\n\r\nthey do not pass on the benefits to the people by revising their\r\n\r\ncharges  and  rentals.  I feel that the Government  should  take\r\n\r\nactive  steps to ensure that the people would also benefit  from\r\n\r\nthese cost-cutting measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission\r\n\r\nto clarify certain matters mentioned by Mr Seng?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Seng was asking me how\r\n\r\nmany  people had died as a result of this crisis.

One committed\r\n\r\nsuicide  because of heavy losses in the stock market, the  other\r\n\r\nbecame  very  ill  when  the  property  market  plummeted,   and\r\n\r\neventually  succumbed to his illness.  Mr  Seng  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  attempted to explain to the  people,  but  many\r\n\r\npeople  still could not understand.  This is because,  just  two\r\n\r\nyears ago, at the General Election in 1997, the PAP was full  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  that Singapore would enjoy 5% to 7% growth  for  the\r\n\r\nnext  few years.  One of the important platforms of its election\r\n\r\nmanifesto is to create wealth for the people.  Now, not only  no\r\n\r\nwealth is created, in fact, people are losing their wealth.   So\r\n\r\nmany  people do not understand.  I think perhaps Mr Seng  should\r\n\r\ncause more publicity to be made through our media on this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Low told\r\n\r\nus  that two people had  died in Hougang - one committed suicide\r\n\r\nbecause  of  speculation in the stock market and the other  fell\r\n\r\nill  when  property prices went down. This may not be  the  only\r\n\r\ncause of their demise. Perhaps they did not have regular medical\r\n\r\ncheck-ups  and  they  had heart attacks.   There  may  be  other\r\n\r\nfactors.   They cannot blame the Government for their losses  in\r\n\r\nthe  stock  market or the property market.  I do not  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmade  to  apologize to them.   In fact, it is Mr Low who  should\r\n\r\napologise  to  his  voters.  We have been  working  so  hard  to\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the people about the vulnerability of our  economy.\r\n\r\nWhy  did Mr Low not explain to his constituents that they should\r\n\r\nnot  speculate in the stock market or the property  market?   He\r\n\r\nshould apologise to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for creating wealth, I think we have to look at the whole\r\n\r\ncycle.   In everything, there are always the ups and downs.   We\r\n\r\nhave  our downs because we are affected by the regional  crisis,\r\n\r\nbut  this is only a short-term matter.  So long as we work hard,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see  the light at the end of the tunnel.  But  for  the\r\n\r\nother  countries in this region, they do not know when they  can\r\n\r\nrecover.   As to creating wealth together, the target  is  still\r\n\r\nthere.   So  long  as we put in a concerted effort,  we  can  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the  tunnel and we see light at the other  end  of  the\r\n\r\ntunnel.   It is not like what Mr Low said that there is no  hope\r\n\r\nat all.  We cannot see any light at all.  I do not think so.  So\r\n\r\nlong  as  we can tide over these difficult times, our  increased\r\n\r\ninvestment  in education and national defence will lead us  into\r\n\r\nthe 21st century with better lives for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Of course, Mr Seng said\r\n\r\nthere  are ups and downs.  We all understand that at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe tunnel there is light.  But we do not have to publicise that\r\n\r\nthis  is  due to the efforts of the PAP Government.  During  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Election,  the  impression  was  that  you  have   more\r\n\r\nprosperous years ahead, more good years ahead.  So when there is\r\n\r\na  crisis, you cannot put the blame on others and say that it is\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  regional  crisis  that  our  economy  takes  a\r\n\r\ndownturn.   When times are good, you say, well, it  is  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment which is very efficient and very good, and  therefore\r\n\r\nyou  have  these good results.  How do you reconcile  these  two\r\n\r\narguments?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  small  country.  All the  time  we  have  been\r\n\r\nemphasising that we have to venture\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noutside.  Before and during the election we had been telling our\r\n\r\npeople  that  our target was to venture outside  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  go  for  a  bigger market.  Now the world  market  has\r\n\r\nweakened.   So  definitely we would be affected.  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nand  must  be affected by the regional crisis.  We are  not  the\r\n\r\nonly  country  that has been affected.  But as for  Mr  Low,  he\r\n\r\nmentioned  that  the PAP Government has made a  promise  and  it\r\n\r\ncannot  be fulfilled and the PAP Government must apologise.   He\r\n\r\nmust  understand  that  during  the  last  one  year,  how  many\r\n\r\npolitical leaders in this region were forced to step down.   Why\r\n\r\nis  it  that  the political leaders in Singapore need  not  step\r\n\r\ndown?  This is because we have proved to the people that we have\r\n\r\nthe  fundamentals right!  In other countries, when the  workers'\r\n\r\nsalaries,  or  even  the bonuses, are reduced,  there  would  be\r\n\r\ndemonstrations and even  riots.  But our wage reduction exercise\r\n\r\nwas carried out smoothly and  peacefully without a hitch.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement presented by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his review of the economy, the Finance Minister stated that\r\n\r\nwhile the Government was deliberating over policy options,  they\r\n\r\nidentified  that  the  critical  issues  were  to  maintain  the\r\n\r\nframework  for continued economic activity; help companies  tide\r\n\r\nover  the  crisis  and minimise unemployment;  and  enhance  our\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and  competitiveness for future  growth.   In  his\r\n\r\nBudget  speech, the Finance Minister stated that the expenditure\r\n\r\nwould be focused on fostering future growth by investing heavily\r\n\r\non  developing  our human resources, in economic  infrastructure\r\n\r\nand other areas which yield lasting returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the issues identified - the need to invest for the\r\n\r\nfuture  and the basic thrust of the Budget.  And I take  comfort\r\n\r\nthat  the  proposal is to maintain the same level of expenditure\r\n\r\non defence and to increase expenditure on education.  My concern\r\n\r\nis principally on whether enough is being done to help those who\r\n\r\nare  now  in  a  desperate financial situation.  I am  concerned\r\n\r\nabout those who have tried\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  help  themselves and are now at wits end.  Last  year,  some\r\n\r\n28,000  people were retrenched, and expectation is that  another\r\n\r\n20,000  people  will  be retrenched this year.   The  number  of\r\n\r\npeople  joining  the  rank  of the bankrupts  is  growing.   The\r\n\r\nrebates  on rental and S&C charges will certainly be a big  help\r\n\r\nto  many.   However,  there is a need for direct  assistance  to\r\n\r\nthose  in a desperate financial position.  Some of these  people\r\n\r\nare  those  who have lost their jobs and are having difficulties\r\n\r\ngetting  re-employed.  It is too easy to sweepingly assume  that\r\n\r\nthose  who remain unemployed are being fussy.  There are  people\r\n\r\nwho,  because of their age, lack of paper qualification or  some\r\n\r\nother  discriminating  reasons, are forced  to  live  off  their\r\n\r\nsavings,  if  any.   Their family members are  affected  by  the\r\n\r\nsudden loss of income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just one of the schools in which I am serving, there has\r\n\r\nbeen a request for financial assistance from nine pupils in just\r\n\r\nthe  first  two months of 1999.  The Ministry of Education  does\r\n\r\nassist  with  waiver  of  school fees but  assistance  is  still\r\n\r\nrequired  for  things like supplementary fees.  In  some  cases,\r\n\r\nhelp  is  being sought for bus fares, books and meals.   We  are\r\n\r\nright  in  investing in our people for they are  our  resources.\r\n\r\nHowever, whilst we focus on the future, we should not lose sight\r\n\r\nof  the  present.   For  all those who are  having  difficulties\r\n\r\nmaking ends meet, the future is but a vague dream.  It is  heart\r\n\r\nbreaking  to  hear  of  students who  decide  to  abandon  their\r\n\r\neducation and leave school to find work to help the family  deal\r\n\r\nwith finances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have always been people with difficulties and they are\r\n\r\nbeing  helped  by  a  network of voluntary  organisations.   The\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic downturn has added stress to  the  operational\r\n\r\ncapabilities.   Many VWOs have had their budget  slashed  by  at\r\n\r\nleast  10%  across  the  board because of  the  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nraising  funds.  During these difficult times, there are  people\r\n\r\nwho  have contributed to our economy in the past and who are now\r\n\r\npleading for help, help to survive the present and thus creating\r\n\r\nhope  for the future.  In helping people to survive the present,\r\n\r\nwe are but investing for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfuture.   It  is  clear that something extra is  required.   The\r\n\r\ntotal budget expenditure is $29.1 billion of which only 1.66% is\r\n\r\nallocated  to  Community Development,  or  0.34%  of  GDP.   The\r\n\r\nstatistics  would  hardly be affected if $10  million  could  be\r\n\r\nfound  to  act  as  a safety net fund against  which  people  in\r\n\r\ndesperate need could apply for some help.  This would be a  one-time  contribution and such a fund, if administered purely as  a\r\n\r\nsafety net, would go a long way to helping a lot of families and\r\n\r\ncould  last  until  the economy turns around.   I  urge  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration for this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Budget Statement be proceeded with\r\n\r\nbeyond  4.30 pm and the proceedings thereon be exempted at  this\r\n\r\nday's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr\r\n\r\nWong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I thank you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  for  allowing  me  to  participate  in  this  debate.   My\r\n\r\nintention   is  to  appeal  for  bigger  and  sustained   budget\r\n\r\nallocations for the Ministry of Health yearly.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nbeseech  the  Minister for Finance to give  my  request  earnest\r\n\r\nconsideration  in  view  of the fast and  vast  improvements  in\r\n\r\nscience  and technology within the medical field and in view  of\r\n\r\nthe  social  changes within our society.  Sir, the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth,   as  a  non-profitable  and  \"expense  only\"   economic\r\n\r\ncontributor, may have received a low priority not only this time\r\n\r\nround  but also in the future.  However, I feel that this should\r\n\r\nnot  be  the  case  because  we  may  compromise  our  excellent\r\n\r\nhealthcare system.  The Ministry of Health deals with life - the\r\n\r\nvery  essence of our being.  We would have accomplished  nothing\r\n\r\nif  we  lag  behind  in providing excellent  healthcare  and  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining our people at their best in health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past few years, Singapore's national health\r\n\r\nexpenditure has remained stable at about 3% of GDP.  However,  a\r\n\r\nrecent NUS/IPS study commissioned by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Health  indicates that  Singapore's  national\r\n\r\nhealth  expenditure, at the current level of  health  servicing,\r\n\r\nwill  rise  to  7%  of GDP by 2030, due to the  `ageing  factor'\r\n\r\nalone.   Sir,  the  economic  pressure  is  also  likely  to  be\r\n\r\naggravated by rapid advancement in medical health science  which\r\n\r\nbrings,  in  its wake, the introduction of many life-saving  but\r\n\r\nexpensive new medical technologies and innovations.  The present\r\n\r\ngeneration of Singaporeans is more savvy and will be  even  more\r\n\r\nso  in the years to come.  They will have higher expectations of\r\n\r\nour  healthcare  system and will demand much more  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ntheir healthcare needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cope with the changing social trend, there is\r\n\r\nan  urgency  to  revamp  some areas in  our  current  healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem.  Mr Speaker, Sir, our current healthcare system is  very\r\n\r\nmuch  orientated  for  a  \"young population\".   Our  demographic\r\n\r\nprofile  is  undergoing rapid changes, and our  population  will\r\n\r\nbecome  a  mature one within the next generation.  By  the  year\r\n\r\n2030, the elderly would constitute a tremendously increased  20%\r\n\r\nof  the total population.  There will be an increased prevalence\r\n\r\nof  chronic  diseases with conditions like dementia doubling  in\r\n\r\nincidence.   Sir,  the elderly, those aged 65 years  and  above,\r\n\r\nconsume  a  disproportionate amount of our healthcare resources.\r\n\r\nThis   increasing  trend  of  demand  will  strain  our  present\r\n\r\nhealthcare system.  We have to be proactive to meet the needs of\r\n\r\na `mature population'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to suggest that more funds be\r\n\r\nallocated to the following areas at the very least:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) More funding, and an urgent one too, is required for\r\n\r\nbuilding more nursing homes.  We are short of 1,600 nursing home\r\n\r\nbeds  and we shall need about 15,000 more beds by the year 2030.\r\n\r\nFacilities  for long-term care either in the institutional,  day\r\n\r\ncare or home care settings will have to be strengthened to cater\r\n\r\nto  the  needs of a \"more mature\" society.  Sir, since voluntary\r\n\r\ngroups run the majority of our nursing homes, and we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed  a  speedy  boost  in  the number  of  nursing  homes,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  may  have to review the present method  of  funding.\r\n\r\nThere is a need to encourage more voluntary groups to build more\r\n\r\nand  reduce our shortfall.  The present 50:50 sharing of running\r\n\r\ncosts  may  be  a little too arduous for many voluntary  groups.\r\n\r\nThe  cost  of  building a new nursing home  runs  into  tens  of\r\n\r\nmillions  of dollars.  The capital sharing of 90% by Government,\r\n\r\nwhich is still too onerous, may have to be reviewed as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Sir, increased funds for setting up more disease\r\n\r\nprevention  and intervention programmes will reap us rewards  in\r\n\r\nthe  future.  The key to successfully reduce projected  cost  of\r\n\r\nfuture  healthcare burdens is to promote healthy lifestyles  and\r\n\r\nprovide  preventive healthcare.  The rewards can be  immense  if\r\n\r\nthis  is done swiftly and targeted towards the whole population.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been shown that, among the middle-aged in Finland,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of deaths from heart attack and cerebral stroke could  be\r\n\r\ndecreased to less than half through preventive measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Another area that needs more funding, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwould  be  in the training of more healthcare professionals  and\r\n\r\nother   informal  caregivers  for  the  elderly.   Training   in\r\n\r\ngeriatrics for doctors has to be accelerated and the opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  such  training must be extended to all doctors and  nurses.\r\n\r\nAll  these  efforts will not only provide better  care  for  our\r\n\r\nelderly  but also facilitate the availability in due  course  of\r\n\r\nhome  care.  The gist of \"elder care\" is to keep our elderly  as\r\n\r\nambulatory  for  as  long  as possible,  to  keep  them  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  for as long as possible, to tap the care of families,\r\n\r\nfriends  and voluntary groups in the community for  as  long  as\r\n\r\npossible.   Institutional care should be used  only  as  a  last\r\n\r\nresort.    In  order  to  achieve  this,  promotion  of  healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyles  and preventive medicine to our elderly is essential.\r\n\r\nMore trained personnel is needed to work at the grassroots level\r\n\r\nisland wide for this to succeed.  Sir, this will require  a  lot\r\n\r\nof time, effort and funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Support is also needed to address issues of prevention,\r\n\r\nearly  detection, treatment of many diverse conditions.  A  good\r\n\r\nillustration  of  this  would be in the management  of  cancers.\r\n\r\nMany  cancers,  examples of which would be cervical  cancer  and\r\n\r\nbreast  cancer,  are  curable  if  detected  early.   Pap  smear\r\n\r\nscreening  tests  which are available readily in  Singapore  for\r\n\r\nmany  years  have reduced the incidence of cervical cancer.   We\r\n\r\nhave  now  got  to address the situation with other  conditions.\r\n\r\nThe  prevalence of breast cancer - the most common cancer  among\r\n\r\nSingapore women - is a good one to start with.  We must see that\r\n\r\nfunds  are  allocated  towards more public  awareness  promotion\r\n\r\nprogrammes    and   mass   mammography   screening   programmes.\r\n\r\nAccelerated provision of personnel and mammography machines  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  breast  cancer.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment must increase the aid given to voluntary groups  that\r\n\r\nwork for and support those with breast cancer in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Singapore has a growing reputation as a premier\r\n\r\nregional medical centre.  High professional standards and a pool\r\n\r\nof  well-trained  doctors  and healthcare  workers  have  to  be\r\n\r\nmaintained to provide quality medical services.  There had  been\r\n\r\na stream of foreign patients being treated in Singapore prior to\r\n\r\nthis economic crisis.  Although the numbers of such patients may\r\n\r\nhave decreased, we should continue to maintain our reputation as\r\n\r\na  premier  regional medical centre.  To do this,  more  funding\r\n\r\nmust  be provided for more training and research, especially  in\r\n\r\nthose  areas  fast improving in science and technology.   It  is\r\n\r\nbetter  for Singapore to keep abreast of new knowledge,  perhaps\r\n\r\neven generate new knowledge, in order to remain relevant in this\r\n\r\nmedical  arena.   This cannot be achieved without  adequate  and\r\n\r\ntimely funding.  Maintaining men and machines means money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a tremendous challenge facing us\r\n\r\nin  the scope of healthcare in Singapore.  The earlier we embark\r\n\r\non  meeting this challenge, the lesser we will feel the pinch of\r\n\r\nthe  expense  and the better we can cope with the needs  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Sir, the provision\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  more money, and in steadily increasing amounts each year, is\r\n\r\nemerging  as  the  way  to successfully  deal  with  the  future\r\n\r\nhealthcare  needs of Singapore.  Sir, the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nholds the key to the money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  there  are  two  features  in  the  1999  Budget\r\n\r\npresented  by Finance Minister Dr Richard Hu last week  which  I\r\n\r\nthink are noteworthy and praiseworthy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this is Singapore's first deficit budget in many years,\r\n\r\nand the deficit is some $5.1 billion,  equivalent to 3.5% of our\r\n\r\nGDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in order to further strengthen the long-term growth\r\n\r\npotential of our economy, and to encourage the development of  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy, the Government has provided for  $13.94\r\n\r\nbillion  as  development expenditure for the various ministries.\r\n\r\nThe development estimate this year has grown by 9.8% as compared\r\n\r\nto  last year.  This is the highest development estimate in  the\r\n\r\nhistory of  Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, last year, when I spoke in this House, I made a plea\r\n\r\non  behalf of the business community to the Finance Minister for\r\n\r\na  balanced budget, rather than  emphasising how much surplus we\r\n\r\nhave  in our budget each year.   I am pleasantly surprised  that\r\n\r\nin  the Budget for FY 1999, the Finance Minister has gone a step\r\n\r\nfurther than what I asked for - he has adopted a deficit  budget\r\n\r\nrescue  strategy  for our economy.  On behalf  of  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity, I would like to say we welcome this decision  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering our economic foundation and strength, even in this\r\n\r\neconomic downturn, it is still not impossible for us to maintain\r\n\r\na balanced budget,  but there is a price to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's budget, there is a $5.1 billion deficit. This\r\n\r\nmeans,  if  the Government wants to maintain a balanced  budget,\r\n\r\nit  would have to cut down its expenditure by $5.1 billion.   In\r\n\r\nother words, the Government has to cut down\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspending on social and community development (39%), security and\r\n\r\ndefence  (32%),  economic infrastructure development  (19%)  and\r\n\r\nother  expenditures  to  save $5.1 billion  in  order  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout a balanced budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this is not feasible. The consequences will only be\r\n\r\nlower   quality of social and community services, weaker defence\r\n\r\nand   security,   and  slower  development   in   our   economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  and our international competitiveness  will  be\r\n\r\naffected.   Therefore, I feel that formulating a deficit  budget\r\n\r\nis  a  very wise decision by the Finance Minister.  On  the  one\r\n\r\nhand, it looks after our people who are facing  difficulties, to\r\n\r\nsolve  their  short-term problems; on the other  hand,  all  the\r\n\r\nvarious development plans can continue to be implemented to look\r\n\r\nafter the long-term interest of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people hold the view that many countries in this\r\n\r\nregion  are  facing  economic difficulties  and  have  cut  down\r\n\r\nsubstantially  on defence expenditure in order to  squeeze  more\r\n\r\nmoney to finance other development projects.  They advocate that\r\n\r\nSingapore should also do the same and cut down substantially  on\r\n\r\ndefence expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with such a view. In fact, I feel more\r\n\r\ncomfortable  that  the budget has allocated  32%  of  our  total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  defence  and  security  because,  after   all,\r\n\r\nsecurity  is  of utmost importance.  If we have no security  for\r\n\r\nsafety,   then   all   our  achievements   accumulated   through\r\n\r\ngenerations  of toilsome hard work   may be wiped out  overnight\r\n\r\nat  any time.   Some people are concerned that at this time when\r\n\r\nthe  other  countries in this region are cutting down  on  their\r\n\r\ndefence  spending, Singapore is increasing it, and we  may  give\r\n\r\nothers  the  wrong impression that we are a bellicose.   I  feel\r\n\r\nsuch a view is 100% wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, more than 2,000 years ago, during the spring\r\n\r\nand   autumn    warring  states   period,  the  great   military\r\n\r\nstrategist,  Sun  Tzu,  had already proposed  that  ever-winning\r\n\r\nstrategic idea of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuilding up a superior army while not at war.  That is  to  say,\r\n\r\nat peace time, we must strengthen our defence to ensure that our\r\n\r\ndefence strength will always be superior to any potential enemy.\r\n\r\nRealizing  that their armies are not as powerful  as  ours,  the\r\n\r\npotential enemies will not dare to act rashly and will leave  us\r\n\r\nalone.   Only  in this way, can we enjoy true peace.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  by maintaining a large defence expenditure, it does  not\r\n\r\nimply  that Singapore is a nation which is wantonly engaging  in\r\n\r\nmilitary  aggression.  On the contrary, we are  just  practising\r\n\r\nSun  Tzu's  ever-winning theory of \"building up a superior  army\r\n\r\nwhile  not  at  war\".   Our purpose is to  provide  security  to\r\n\r\nourselves and to maintain peace and security in this region  and\r\n\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I support this deficit budget to pay for sustained\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  various  ministries,  including   Defence,\r\n\r\nEducation, Health, Trade and Industry, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to media reports, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong pointed\r\n\r\nout  in  Melbourne last Friday that even if we continued to  run\r\n\r\ninto  a  budget  deficit  for the next one  or  two  years,  the\r\n\r\nsurpluses accumulated by this current Government would still  be\r\n\r\nadequate   to   support   our  necessary  national   development\r\n\r\nprogrammes, and there would be no need to dip into the  reserves\r\n\r\naccumulated by the previous governments.  As such, we  need  not\r\n\r\nbe  overly  concerned with the deficit of $5.1 billion  in  this\r\n\r\nyear's  budget.   The  Prime Minister  also  said  that  if  the\r\n\r\nexternal  factors remained unchanged, the effect of this  year's\r\n\r\nbudget  and  last November's $10.5 billion cost-cutting  package\r\n\r\nwould come into full play in the second half of this year and it\r\n\r\nwas  envisaged  that  our economy at that time  would  see  some\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the business community understands that\r\n\r\nthis  deficit  budget and last year's cost-cutting package  will\r\n\r\ntake  some  time  before there will be effects on  our  economic\r\n\r\nsystem.   While  waiting for these measures to bring  about  the\r\n\r\ndesired  effects  to  our  economy, the business  community  has\r\n\r\nrefrained  from making too many requests, less we be accused  of\r\n\r\nshowing no understanding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  times.    However, the Government must not  ignore  the\r\n\r\nplight  of  our small and medium enterprises and leave  them  to\r\n\r\nswim or sink by themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a friend who is a small\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  with  investments in the  neighbouring  countries.\r\n\r\nBecause of the regional factors well known to all of us, he  had\r\n\r\nno  choice  but to wind up his overseas business and  return  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Upon his return, he wanted to lower his standard of\r\n\r\nliving, but he cannot get any buyer for his house.  He tried  to\r\n\r\nlook for a job,  but he could not secure any.  His wife who  had\r\n\r\nnot  been working for many years wanted to come out and work  to\r\n\r\nhelp  support the family, but nobody was willing to employ  her,\r\n\r\nbecause  the type of industry which she was formerly working  in\r\n\r\nhad  been  phased  out because of economic restructuring.   This\r\n\r\nfriend  of  mine  has never been an employee.  His  wife  was  a\r\n\r\nsalaried  worker who resigned from her job many years ago.   Now\r\n\r\nboth husband and wife are unemployed.  They have no business  to\r\n\r\ndo either.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there are many such families in Singapore at the moment.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to ask the Government whether there  are\r\n\r\nany  statistics to show how many people in Singapore  today  are\r\n\r\nneither bankrupts nor listed in the unemployment list, but   are\r\n\r\nactually   jobless.   How  many  such  families  are  there   in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should look at this problem squarely.\r\n\r\nIt must seriously consider the plight of these families and help\r\n\r\nthem  as  far as possible.  Otherwise, very soon, a very serious\r\n\r\nsocial problem may soon emerge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot help the entrepreneurs at a time when they are\r\n\r\nnot doing well, we should give them a chance to be \"born again\".\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  how could we be able to encourage more  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  take  on  greater risks of venturing overseas?  How  are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to pave the way for our knowledge-based economy?  I think\r\n\r\nthis  is  a critical question that the Government cannot  ignore\r\n\r\nand must find a solution to it as early as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion in the name of the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  support of the motion standing in  the  name  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that some positive signs have\r\n\r\nemerged   over  the  last  three  months  that  the  crisis   is\r\n\r\nstabilising.   The Minister also said that the quick  succession\r\n\r\nof  the  US federal rate cuts and the coordinated interest  rate\r\n\r\nreduction  initiated by the European central banks  towards  the\r\n\r\nclose  of last year helped to allay concerns of a global  credit\r\n\r\ncrunch  and set the stage for a rapid recovery of the  financial\r\n\r\nmarkets in early 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear the assurance of the Minister that the\r\n\r\nworld economic outlook seems promising despite his concern  that\r\n\r\nthere  could be sharp discontinuities for Singapore in the  year\r\n\r\nahead of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Singaporean, I would like to share the optimisitc\r\n\r\noutlook  of our Minister.  However, recent economic developments\r\n\r\noutside the region may serve to dampen much of our optimism  for\r\n\r\nthe  future.  In the last few months, we have seen the  relative\r\n\r\nvolatility  of  the financial markets not seen in recent  times.\r\n\r\nTo  begin  with,  we  have seen the financial instability  which\r\n\r\nstarted in South East Asia spread in the last year to Russia and\r\n\r\nBrazil.   Russia  suffered a massive loss of confidence  in  its\r\n\r\neconomy  when the government defaulted massively on its external\r\n\r\nborrowing which included the default on the US$40 billion rouble\r\n\r\nbonds,  and the interest and capital repayment which is  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  International  Monetary Fund and the World  Bank.   By  its\r\n\r\ndefault,  Russia has placed itself in the same  company  as  the\r\n\r\nother  third world countries like Sudan, Afghanistan, and Congo.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a reflection of the poverty and weakness of the  Russian\r\n\r\neconomy, which arguably is also a reflection of the state of the\r\n\r\nworld  economy today.  Fortunately, the default of  the  Russian\r\n\r\ngovernment  has had a limited effect on the rest of  Europe  and\r\n\r\nthe  world economy, in part, because of the relative size of the\r\n\r\nRussian economy compared to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of the developed world.  Nonetheless, it is  arguable\r\n\r\nthat  the collapse of the Russian economy portends that not  all\r\n\r\nis well with the world economy at the moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the floatation of the Brazilian real recently\r\n\r\ndoes  suggest that the world economy is still fragile and prone,\r\n\r\nto  use the words of the Minister, to bouts of nervousness.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  devaluation of the Brazilian real initially  brought\r\n\r\nabout  some  anxiety  that a new round  of  contagion  could  be\r\n\r\ntriggered.  Although, the Brazilian crisis did not turn  out  to\r\n\r\nbe  as  bad as was anticipated, it nonetheless drives  home  the\r\n\r\npoint of fragility and interdependence of the world economy.  We\r\n\r\nare  not,  by  any measure, shielded from that which  is  taking\r\n\r\nplace  elsewhere.   We  are still very  vulnerable  to  external\r\n\r\nfactors which are beyond our control.  Much as we would like  to\r\n\r\nthink that present indicators show a stablising situation in the\r\n\r\nregion,  we  should  not be too sanguine about  things.   Things\r\n\r\ncould still go wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, at the moment, some signs that the world may be\r\n\r\nheading  for  a  more serious downturn.  The  Economist  in  its\r\n\r\nrecent  publication  argued that in much of  the  world  outside\r\n\r\nAmerica  the  risk  of deflation is at its  greatest  since  the\r\n\r\n1930s.   Japan  is  suffering  from deflationary  pressure.   In\r\n\r\nChina, prices are continuing to fall as with some other parts of\r\n\r\nEast  Asia.   Continental Europe's inflation rate  is  close  to\r\n\r\nzero.  Prices are coming down, thanks in part to the effects  of\r\n\r\nnew  technology  and  to  falling  commodity  prices.   Although\r\n\r\ndeflation is generally benign, the long term effect of unbridled\r\n\r\ndeflation,  caused  by excess capacity and  weak  demand,  would\r\n\r\neasily  lead to a depression, with prices and output falling  as\r\n\r\nthey did 70 years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both Europe and the United States join Japan in the\r\n\r\ncurrent deflationary trend, I would say that we have a lot  more\r\n\r\nreason to worry for the coming year.  This would be contrary  to\r\n\r\nwhat the press had reported earlier of the Ministry of Trade\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  Industry's  statement  that the  economy  in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nexpected to turn around by the middle of the year.  In fact,  my\r\n\r\nassessment  is a more pessismistic one if recent indicators  are\r\n\r\nanything to go by.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent comment by an official from the Trade Development\r\n\r\nBoard has indicated that Singapore's share of the US electronics\r\n\r\nmarket, excluding consumer electronics, had fallen from 12.8% in\r\n\r\nJune  1997  to 10.6% by September 1998.  The decline  in  market\r\n\r\nshare may be attributable to Singapore's loss of competitiveness\r\n\r\nagainst exporters from China and Mexico, among others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sassoon, in a recent report, argued that the loss of\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  has  its  roots as a result  of  the  following\r\n\r\ndevelopments in global trends:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the advent of the budget PCs which are below US$1,000, as\r\n\r\nPC  makers  compete fiercely with each other to  give  consumers\r\n\r\nmore value for money;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the resultant plunge in prices of components such as disk\r\n\r\ndrives  and  semi-conductors over the past two to  three  years,\r\n\r\nwhich  reduces  the  high-rise, high margin  products  to  high-volume, low margin commodities; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the constant pressure on manufacturers to outsource and\r\n\r\nsupply at even lower cost, which lead contract manufacturers  to\r\n\r\nlocate   their   operations  in  places  where   the   cost   of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  is  substantially lower  than  Singapore.   These\r\n\r\ncountries include, for instance, China and Mexico.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are faced therefore with a serious situation where we\r\n\r\nare  losing our competitiveness to the other emerging economies.\r\n\r\nThis  is a challenge which should not be taken lightly.   It  is\r\n\r\nright  that  our Government should recently adopt  the  measures\r\n\r\nwhich   the   Committee   on  Singapore's  Competitiveness   has\r\n\r\nrecommended.  Hopefully, these measures will help to provide the\r\n\r\nmuch  needed boost to our competitiveness.  Unfortunately, these\r\n\r\nare  still  early  days.   It would be  difficult  to  determine\r\n\r\nupfront  at  this  moment whether the measures  adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will yield effective\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresults   in   bolstering  the  competitiveness  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy.  At the moment, there are clear indications as we  have\r\n\r\nseen  in  the  electronics  sector,  that  we  are  losing   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness to our rivals.  In the long run, this  does  not\r\n\r\naugur well for the Singapore economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this difficult climate, it is heartening to note that\r\n\r\nour Government takes a long-term view of keeping our economy  on\r\n\r\ntrack.  In particular, our Government has identified several key\r\n\r\nstrategies which included cutting business costs, easy access to\r\n\r\nworking   capital   for   the   smaller   enterprises,    market\r\n\r\ndiversification, investment promotion and capabilities building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, our Government announced a series of\r\n\r\ncost  cutting  measures aimed at helping the  businesses  during\r\n\r\nthis economically difficult period.  The cost reduction packages\r\n\r\ninclude  key elements of business costs such as wages,  rentals,\r\n\r\nutilities  and transportation.  The $10.5 billion cost reduction\r\n\r\nexercise  shows  the  resolve  and  the  speed  with  which  our\r\n\r\nGovernment has responded to the crisis; at times, to the envy of\r\n\r\nsome  other  countries.   We have no  choice  but  to  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary sacrifice if we want to stay ahead of competition.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has said, only time will tell whether the measures\r\n\r\nintroduced by our Government will have any beneficial impact  on\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost cutting measures have had a significant impact on\r\n\r\nthe wages of ordinary Singaporean workers.  Our workers have  to\r\n\r\naccept  a  15%  reduction in overall wages.  Such  a  reduction,\r\n\r\nwhile  painful for many, is important, and I would say  that  we\r\n\r\nreally do not have a choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a recent economic survey of Singapore showed that in\r\n\r\n1998,  the  economy continued to experience rising costs.   This\r\n\r\nwas  due  to  the  divergence between  labour  productivity  and\r\n\r\nnominal  wages.   Labour productivity shrank by  1.3%  in  1998,\r\n\r\nwhile  nominal  wages continued to increase  in  1998.   Nominal\r\n\r\naverage monthly earnings grew by 2.8% in 1998.  As a result, the\r\n\r\nunit labour cost index for the overall economy continued\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  increase for 1998.  The November cost cutting measures  will\r\n\r\nonly  begin to have an impact on the economy this financial year\r\n\r\nand we will only know the results in the next financial year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should bear in mind that if we had not done anything to\r\n\r\nour  unit labour cost, our workers may price themselves  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  market.   In  the long run, we may not be able  to  compete\r\n\r\neffectively  against our rivals in the world economy.   We  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  unit labour cost comprises approximately 49%  of  the\r\n\r\nunit  business  cost.   This is certainly  quite  a  significant\r\n\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, our workers understand the position we are in.\r\n\r\nIf  we  want to improve our wages and enjoy a better quality  of\r\n\r\nlife  and  security  of employment, there is  really  no  choice\r\n\r\nexcept  to  ensure that our workers' productivity  continues  to\r\n\r\noutstrip  our  wage  increases.  If we do  not  understand  this\r\n\r\nprinciple  and choose instead to militantly demand higher  wages\r\n\r\nwithout the corresponding improvements in productivity, we  will\r\n\r\nend up poorer for it, especially when one takes into account the\r\n\r\nchanging trends in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, one of our key strategies which will underpin our\r\n\r\nlong  term  competitiveness is to focus on our labour  resource.\r\n\r\nIn capabilities building, our Government is right in saying that\r\n\r\nwe  should  focus on skills development to prepare our workforce\r\n\r\nfor   the   next  wave  of  industrial  revolution  which   will\r\n\r\nprominently feature information technology.  As the Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid, this is a pressing issue.  A disproportionate share of the\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers  in  1998 were 40  years  and  older.   This\r\n\r\nindicates a worrisome trend.  We are seeing an increase  in  the\r\n\r\nprofile  of  ageing employees in our workforce.  In  order  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  be  placed in a position to  be  relevant  to  the\r\n\r\nworkforce, it is imperative that our Government should  continue\r\n\r\nto  pour in resources to retool our workers for the next wave of\r\n\r\nindustrial  revolution.  In this regard, I note that there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  many  non-Singaporeans who have benefited from our  worker\r\n\r\ntraining programmes.  I would urge that in looking at this  area\r\n\r\nof   worker  retraining,  priority  should  continue  to  go  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nespecially  older  Singaporeans, for whom seeking  re-employment\r\n\r\nupon  retrenchment is made so much more difficult on the account\r\n\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans have expressed the concern that this\r\n\r\nyear's Budget has run into a substantial deficit, the biggest we\r\n\r\nhave  seen in recent years.  If anything, there is much  concern\r\n\r\nthat if we continued to spend in this manner, we would soon  run\r\n\r\nout  of  the reserves that we have accumulated for ourselves  in\r\n\r\nthis  current term of office.  This would not be seen as prudent\r\n\r\nmanagement on our part and should therefore be dealt  with  much\r\n\r\ncare  and  concern.  While I too would admit  that  our  present\r\n\r\nbudget deficit is large by any measure, standing at more than $5\r\n\r\nbillion,  we should in fact see our budget deficit in a positive\r\n\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should note that the $5.1 billion budget deficit arises\r\n\r\nmainly  because operating revenue is expected to  fall  by  $3.1\r\n\r\nbillion.   On the other hand, development spending has increased\r\n\r\nby  a  significant  $1.2  billion.   As  was  reported  in  last\r\n\r\nSaturday's  Straits Times, our deficit comes after  10  straight\r\n\r\nyears of surpluses.  We should also note that our budget deficit\r\n\r\nspending is dedicated to capacity building, and is not used  for\r\n\r\nconsumption  spending or for shoring up insolvent companies  and\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions.  The Government has always cited caution\r\n\r\nin  planning our budget, ensuring that we do not spend more than\r\n\r\nwe can afford.  Accumulating surpluses in the good years to tide\r\n\r\nus  through the lean years is a principle that seems like a leaf\r\n\r\nfrom  the  story  of  Joseph in the Bible when  he  advised  the\r\n\r\nPharaoh to save the excesses of the seven years of bumper  crops\r\n\r\nin  order  to  provide for the seven lean years  that  followed.\r\n\r\nThat  proved to be sound advice for the Egyptians, and it  saved\r\n\r\nthem  from famine.  For us, we are in a similar situation.   The\r\n\r\nlean years have come and we should now dip into our savings.   I\r\n\r\nwould therefore support the deficit without any hesitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an effort to help Singaporeans through this\r\n\r\nrecession, we have focused\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  this  Budget  on the man-in-the-street.  To  this  end,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has decided to provide such assistance  as  the  10%\r\n\r\nrebate  on  income tax for those who are paying  taxes  and  the\r\n\r\nrebates  on  service and conservancy (S&C) charges to  help  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  Singaporeans who do not pay  taxes.   While  these\r\n\r\nmeasures are well meaning, I would submit the assistance is  not\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  enough.  I am referring to Singaporeans  who  may\r\n\r\nnot  be paying taxes and who are not fortunate enough to own HDB\r\n\r\nflats and be in a position to enjoy the S&C rebates.  What do we\r\n\r\ndo  to  help them?  Sir, these are Singaporeans who are no  less\r\n\r\ndeserving  of our assistance during this difficult  period.   It\r\n\r\nhas  been  said that for those who are not caught  by  the  net,\r\n\r\nthere is the CCC Assistance Scheme to help them.  The scheme is,\r\n\r\nI  believe, for those who are the abject poor and are  therefore\r\n\r\ndeserving  of  our  assistance through the  CCC.   However,  the\r\n\r\npeople whom I am referring to are those who do not belong to the\r\n\r\ncategory  of  the  abject poor, neither do they  belong  to  the\r\n\r\ncategory of the taxpayers.  Should we not do something for  them\r\n\r\nas well?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister in a recent statement stated that we\r\n\r\nshould  encourage a new breed of technopreneurs;  investors  who\r\n\r\ncan put technology and business together.  Towards this end,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  should review our bankruptcy laws  to  encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to  go  into  business  so  that  they  should  not   be\r\n\r\nstigmatised  by failures.  Sir, I cannot agree more.   Over  the\r\n\r\nyears, we have been so enamoured by the culture of success  that\r\n\r\nwe  see  failure as a disgrace or a blot in the record of  those\r\n\r\nconcerned.  That is wrong and should now be changed.  We  should\r\n\r\nlearn to give others a second chance in life and should learn to\r\n\r\nchange  our values to accommodate that change in principle.   We\r\n\r\nshould  build a culture where failure is not always  seen  as  a\r\n\r\nslight on the character of a person, but as a pillar upon  which\r\n\r\nthe  foundation of success is built.  Sir, I was  told  that  in\r\n\r\nSilicon  Valley,  success is often measured not  only  by  one's\r\n\r\nachievement,  but  by the number of times a person  has  failed.\r\n\r\nThat, Sir, is the true spirit of technopreneurship; the kind  of\r\n\r\nspirit that we want to engender in this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from reviewing our bankruptcy laws, we can use tax\r\n\r\nincentives,  as we are in the habit of doing, to encourage  such\r\n\r\nspirit  of  enterprise.  We know that start up  companies  would\r\n\r\ntake  several  years  before they  can  see  profits.   This  is\r\n\r\nespecially true with information technology companies where  the\r\n\r\nincubation  period  for the hardware or the  software  can  take\r\n\r\nseveral  years before any prospect of profit may be entertained.\r\n\r\nSir,  where there are tax incentives for these companies to help\r\n\r\nthem  to  establish  their footing in  the  industry,  it  would\r\n\r\ncertainly help these investors in a positive way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are all living in rather tumultuous times. The\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis  may have gone into remission for  the  moment.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as I said, the worst is not yet over.  There could  be\r\n\r\nanother round of contagion to hit the region.  We have seen  how\r\n\r\nthe  economic crisis has given way to political crisis  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries.   We,  in  Singapore, are  also  affected,  although,\r\n\r\nfortunately, not of the same extent.  We are indeed fortunate to\r\n\r\nhave a leadership that provided this country with the ballast to\r\n\r\nsail  through  this stormy economic weather.  We should  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  also note that the economic crisis in  Chinese  also\r\n\r\nmeans  a  crisis of opportunity.  Our Budget shows the strategic\r\n\r\ndirection  taken  by our Government for the long  term  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the opportunity.  We are on the right track, and it\r\n\r\nleaves us only to support the Minister's Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the motion as proposed by the Finance Minister.  This\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget  clearly shows that our Government is  farsighted\r\n\r\nand  cautious.  As mentioned by the Finance Minister, \"1999  may\r\n\r\nwell  turn out to be another difficult and challenging year  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"   The  Minister reminded all Singaporeans  that  \"we\r\n\r\nwill  live within our means.\"  This is indeed a timely  reminder\r\n\r\nfor  all Singaporeans who have been enjoying positive GDP growth\r\n\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although economic growth has increased the affluence of\r\n\r\nmany Singaporeans, it has certain setbacks.  Years of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  have  also  made  Singaporeans  to   be   over\r\n\r\noptimistic and sometimes wasteful.  This is evident through  the\r\n\r\nlarge  amount  of  bulky  waste such  as  furniture,  electrical\r\n\r\nappliances, and renovation debris dumped by HDB residents yearly\r\n\r\nover the last 10 years.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.12 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, many town councils noticed a drastic fall of\r\n\r\nbetween  25%  and 50% drop in the bulky waste collection.   This\r\n\r\nclearly  shows  that  many  HDB  dwellers  have  understood  the\r\n\r\nseverity  of the regional crisis, and are more prudent in  their\r\n\r\nspending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is experiencing a difficult period of\r\n\r\nuncertainty.   I  agree that we should seize the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen our economic competitiveness.  But this is  also  the\r\n\r\ntime for the Government to extend a helping hand to Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  are in need.  The crisis has affected many Singaporeans  of\r\n\r\nall income levels in both the HDB and private estates.  Thus,  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister could consider the following suggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Personal tax rebate</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Budget has provided a one-off 10% personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax rebate that is fair.  But there is no relief measure\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans who were retrenched.  Those who were retrenched\r\n\r\nmay  face difficulty to pay their income taxes.  Thus,  I  would\r\n\r\nurge  the  Minister to consider allowing retrenched Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto delay paying their income taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>S&C and utilities rebates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1998, working Singaporeans supported the cost\r\n\r\ncutting measures as proposed by the Government.  Many have taken\r\n\r\na  10% CPF contribution and wage cut, thus facing more financial\r\n\r\nstrain  to  support their families.  Feedback from HDB residents\r\n\r\nshowed  that many expected the Government to provide higher  S&C\r\n\r\nand utilities rebates so as to alleviate their financial burden.\r\n\r\nMany have regarded the Budget as a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"non-event\"  which does not provide much relief to reduce  their\r\n\r\nliving costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the cost cutting measures have saved jobs, many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans felt that businesses have not passed much of  their\r\n\r\ncost  savings  to consumers.  Prices of goods and services  have\r\n\r\nnot   been  reduced  accordingly.   As  such,  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nexperiencing a reduction of purchasing power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, utilities rebate provides an effective and simple\r\n\r\nmeans   to  assist  Singaporeans  in  difficult  times.    While\r\n\r\nSingaporeans agree that water conservation is crucial, they hope\r\n\r\nthat  the Government could adopt other non-monetary measures  to\r\n\r\nencourage  water  conservation instead of increasing  the  water\r\n\r\ntariffs  during  this  difficult time.  The  increase  will  add\r\n\r\nfurther  burden to all households, especially those  with  large\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Finance Minister to consider providing a\r\n\r\n$300  utilities  rebate to all households in HDB  estates.   The\r\n\r\nrebate  shall  be paid on a monthly basis over a  period  of  12\r\n\r\nmonths.   The monthly rebate will serve as a minimum payment  to\r\n\r\nPower  Supply so that families in hardship will not  face  legal\r\n\r\naction  or  utilities  supply cut by Power  Supply  during  this\r\n\r\ndifficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has also increased the number of\r\n\r\nwelfare cases in many constituencies.  In Bukit Panjang, welfare\r\n\r\nassistance  was  provided to 59 families  during  the  last  six\r\n\r\nmonths.   Of  these cases, 53% are from 3-room, 39% from  4-room\r\n\r\nand  8%  from 5-room flats.  The figures show that 3- and 4-room\r\n\r\nflat  dwellers  face more financial strain during  this  period.\r\n\r\nThus,  I hope the Finance Minister can understand the plight  of\r\n\r\nthese  two  groups of residents and increase their  S&C  rebates\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development expenditure</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the development expenditure has increased by $1.2\r\n\r\nbillion  to  $13.9 billion, more could be allocated to  expedite\r\n\r\nthe  development  of  a  world-class land transport  system,  as\r\n\r\nproposed in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhite Paper by the Land Transport Authority in 1996.  As stated,\r\n\r\nLTA  will  provide a seamless land transport system, which  will\r\n\r\noffer   convenience,   reliability,  ease   of   use,   comfort,\r\n\r\naffordability, and competitive travel times to all commuters  of\r\n\r\npublic transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered linkway is identified as one of the features in the\r\n\r\nseamless  land  transport system.  Although LTA has  implemented\r\n\r\nmany  covered  linkways, it is also an  opportune  time  now  to\r\n\r\nexpedite  the construction of linkways for all bus  stops,  taxi\r\n\r\nstands  and  MRT  stations  to  the  housing  estates.   Covered\r\n\r\nlinkways  provide a vital link between our transport system  and\r\n\r\nthe  housing estates.  It has also become a way of life for many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to encourage more Singaporeans to use the public\r\n\r\ntransport system, we should expedite the construction of covered\r\n\r\nlinkways.   Therefore,  I would like to  urge  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nincrease the development budget for covered linkways.  This will\r\n\r\nnot  only  provide much convenience to commuters but  also  save\r\n\r\nsome jobs in the building related industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Incentive to replace diesel vehicles</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the provision of a one year accelerated\r\n\r\ndepreciation  allowance to replace old diesel driven  commercial\r\n\r\ngoods vehicles and buses.  To further protect the air quality of\r\n\r\nour  environment, I would propose that the incentive  scheme  be\r\n\r\nextended  to  all  diesel  plants and  equipment  used  outdoor,\r\n\r\nespecially those at construction sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar incentives could be given to encourage construction\r\n\r\nfirms  and  plant  suppliers to upgrade their  fleet  of  diesel\r\n\r\ndriven   plants  and  equipment  such  as  cranes,   excavators,\r\n\r\ncompactors, rollers, and concrete mixers.  All these plants  and\r\n\r\nequipment are sources of air pollution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Approve IT training grant</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop a knowledge-based economy, we need to encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to acquire life-long learning skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nInformation technology provides an essential tool to  facilitate\r\n\r\nknowledge  acquisition.   In the near  future,  e-commerce  will\r\n\r\nbecome a part of life for many Singaporeans.  But there is still\r\n\r\na  large  proportion of our population who is not familiar  with\r\n\r\ninformation technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we should provide more incentives to increase\r\n\r\nthe  IT  awareness of Singaporeans.  To achieve  this,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that an Approved IT Training Scheme be formed to provide\r\n\r\nlow  cost  IT courses to Singaporeans, especially those  in  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.   In  addition, a capital grant could be given  to  all\r\n\r\ncommunity  clubs  to  set up a Community  IT  Centre  which  can\r\n\r\nprovide training and access to computers for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These IT courses can also be conducted at Residents'\r\n\r\nCommittee  Centres,  thus  making  them  easily  accessible   to\r\n\r\nresidents.   The  People's Association can manage  the  proposed\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  in support of the Budget Statement for the financial  year\r\n\r\n1999-2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is also a difficult one. For the first time\r\n\r\nin   more  than  a  decade,  the  Government  is  presenting  an\r\n\r\nunprecedented   budget  deficit  of  $5.1  billion   and,   more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  it  is  not  letting  off  on  spending  aimed  at\r\n\r\ninvesting  in  the future.  For the first time in  more  than  a\r\n\r\ndecade,   we  are  also  in  a  recession,  which  is  primarily\r\n\r\nattributable to the financial crisis which afflicted the  region\r\n\r\nsince  mid-1997.  At this juncture, a heavy cloud of uncertainty\r\n\r\ncontinues  to hover in the horizon with Japan yet struggling  to\r\n\r\nnurse  themselves out of their prolonged economic downturn  and,\r\n\r\nmore  so,  with the economic, political and social situation  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  yet unresolved.  As the Finance Minister, Dr  Richard\r\n\r\nHu,  has  said, it is  very difficult to predict the future  and\r\n\r\nhow  long  the  current recession is expected  to  last.   As  a\r\n\r\nconsolation,  I  am at least relieved that the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  indicated that the Government might introduce  yet  another\r\n\r\npackage of off-Budget measures\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin due course should the economy take a turn for the worse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as earlier speakers have acknowledged, our business and\r\n\r\nindustry groups are generally satisfied with the Budget  as  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  them feel that they are beginning to benefit  from\r\n\r\nthe  host  of cost-cutting measures introduced in November  last\r\n\r\nyear.  Time is needed to allow the package to show its effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take issue on our vision to develop into a\r\n\r\nglobally  competitive knowledge-based economy (KBE).   With  the\r\n\r\nworld  fast  changing  from an industrial  based  economy  to  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-driven  one, and with Singapore by and  large  already\r\n\r\nplugged   to   the  global  economy,  we  are  now  exposed   to\r\n\r\nincreasingly  aggressive competition and challenges  from  every\r\n\r\ncorner  of  the globe.  To stay ahead of the pack,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nquickly  learn  and  master  new  and  emerging  knowledge   and\r\n\r\ntechnologies  and  creatively harness  this  into  products  and\r\n\r\nservices  demanded by the world.  While I am in full support  of\r\n\r\nthe  host of programmes we already have and are putting in place\r\n\r\nto proceed in this direction, I do have some concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, although much has been said about the important need for\r\n\r\nus  to transit into a KBE to stay ahead, I am not convinced that\r\n\r\nthe majority of businesses, especially smaller ones, and also  a\r\n\r\nlarge  pool of individuals, know what a KBE entails.   Many  are\r\n\r\nstill confused, with the majority associating a KBE with IT  and\r\n\r\nfeel that as long as they are competent in using computers, they\r\n\r\nare   therefore  already  doing  their  part  in   KBE.    While\r\n\r\ninformation technology (IT) is the key enabler for  the  KBE,  a\r\n\r\nKBE  itself  is  much  more than that.  It  is  primarily  about\r\n\r\nunleashing  and  optimally employing knowledge that  resides  in\r\n\r\npeople's heads or captured in IT systems and processes, and then\r\n\r\ntapping and applying this to work, or economic activities which,\r\n\r\nin  turn,  contribute to the nation's competitiveness,  GDP  and\r\n\r\neconomic growth.  It is not confined to certain sectors  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy only, but permeates the entire economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Government and the media to embark on\r\n\r\nanother  phase  of  public  education  to  clearly  explain,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  in simple and caricature form of what a KBE  is  all\r\n\r\nabout  so  that  businesses and individuals alike  can  properly\r\n\r\nexecute  their  roles in successfully transforming  our  economy\r\n\r\ninto a KBE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is the impact of KBE on unemployment. As we push\r\n\r\nahead  to transform Singapore into a KBE, it is inevitable  that\r\n\r\nsome degree of structural unemployment will result.  Even if our\r\n\r\npresent  recessionary  economy is on the track  of  recovery,  I\r\n\r\nstill  feel  that  structural unemployment is  unavoidable.   We\r\n\r\ntherefore  need to do everything within our means, at  least  to\r\n\r\nminimise  this effect.  I am happy that substantial  amounts  of\r\n\r\nfunds have been set aside through major programmes, such as  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment Programme, to press on with knowledge  and\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading to tackle this problem.  Here, I  think  there\r\n\r\nwill always be people who would adopt a wait-and-see attitude in\r\n\r\nthe  hope  that  they would get back their  old  jobs  once  the\r\n\r\neconomy  recovers.  The fact is that with our stepped up  effort\r\n\r\nto  attract  and create higher value-added jobs and  activities,\r\n\r\nthe  old  jobs these people have would have disappeared  forever\r\n\r\nand  therefore  these people, especially the old and  the  lower\r\n\r\nskilled ones, will continue to remain unemployed.  This group of\r\n\r\npeople, therefore, needs to be continually warned of the  danger\r\n\r\nof becoming irrelevant to the economy and remaining indefinitely\r\n\r\nunemployed  if  they do not take heed of the repeated  calls  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  themselves.  The NTUC and self-help groups and training\r\n\r\nproviders could help in propagating such information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the SRP programmes are aimed at preparing our workforce to\r\n\r\nremain  employable  in  the  changing  employment  and  economic\r\n\r\nlandscape, managers and professionals too need to upgrade  their\r\n\r\nacademic  and  professional knowledge to keep  up.   Doing  this\r\n\r\nthrough specialised or post-graduate courses can be very  costly\r\n\r\nand can run into tens of thousands of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndollars.   I  feel  that  Government could  have  done  more  in\r\n\r\nallowing  a  higher  amount  than  the  revised  $2,500  in  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction  for course fees to encourage professional  adults  to\r\n\r\nimprove their skills and knowledge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to now turn to the subject of technopreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe   Government's   recent  step   to   support   and   promote\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship  is consistent with our KBE  positioning.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to nurture home-bred SMEs so that they can grow into world\r\n\r\nclass  companies  capable of competing  globally.   We  need  to\r\n\r\ncreate  more Sim Wong Hoos and diversify our economy so that  we\r\n\r\ncan  become  less dependent on multi-national companies  (MNCs).\r\n\r\nWhile  MNCs  have played a key role in providing foreign  direct\r\n\r\ninvestments (FDIs), create jobs and significantly contributed to\r\n\r\nour  economic  growth, we must bear in mind that most  of  these\r\n\r\ninvestments are mobile and can be quite easily relocated.   This\r\n\r\nexposes  us  to  economic vulnerability.  With  an  increasingly\r\n\r\neducated workforce, we are in a better position now to encourage\r\n\r\nmore sophisticated entrepreneurship to decrease our reliance  on\r\n\r\nMNCs.   Taiwan supposedly has been able to escape the  worst  of\r\n\r\nthe  financial  turmoil because of its government's  ability  to\r\n\r\ncreate the conditions in which SMEs thrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Economic Development Board is\r\n\r\nsetting  aside funds to co-invest in Promising Local Enterprises\r\n\r\nto  provide them with management expertise and capital  infusion\r\n\r\nneeded  to grow their businesses.  On the other side of  it,  we\r\n\r\nmust not forget the smaller businesses with big ideas which also\r\n\r\nneed cultivation.  The move towards revising bankruptcy laws  to\r\n\r\nprovide  businesses which failed the first time around a  second\r\n\r\nchance,  as Mr Sin Boon Ann, Member for Tampines GRC  has  said,\r\n\r\nand   the   set  up  of  a  high  level  committee  to   promote\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship chaired by DPM Tony Tan, are  all  encouraging\r\n\r\nsteps  towards  evolving  a  vibrant technopreneurship  hub  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However, all these efforts could come to  nought  if\r\n\r\nwe  move too slowly.  What is important to bear in mind is  that\r\n\r\neven the best of ideas needs seed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncapital to get moving.  Venture capital should be encouraged  to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  promising  business dreams and help  turn  them  into\r\n\r\nrealities.   The  Government  could assist  by  encouraging  the\r\n\r\npooling  of  start-up  funds by individuals  and  SMEs  to  fund\r\n\r\npromising  ventures or co-share in small loans to  provide  seed\r\n\r\nmoney  for  businesses  which are risky but  innovative.   In  a\r\n\r\nrecession  where jobs are less plentiful, this is the best  time\r\n\r\nto arrest the risk-averse mentality and encourage such ventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me now to make a point on life-long learning\r\n\r\nwhich is also tied to KBE.  I am thrilled with Dr Lee Boon Yang,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Manpower's recent announcement of Manpower  21\r\n\r\nwhich addresses the strategy formulation for the development  of\r\n\r\na  globally  competitive workforce aimed at driving a knowledge-based  economy.   While  the  six key  features  supporting  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  a  school of life-long learning  announced  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  are  well conceptualised, I have one key concern,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is the ability to reach out to older workers, particularly\r\n\r\nthose with only primary and lower secondary education to embrace\r\n\r\nthis concept.  I believe it will require the continuous combined\r\n\r\nefforts of the Government, unions and employers to persuade this\r\n\r\ngroup  of workers to upgrade themselves, so that they can remain\r\n\r\nrelevant for the remaining balance of their economic life.  Self-help  groups  and  grassroots organisations could  also  play  a\r\n\r\nmeaningful  role  to  assist  the  tripartite  parties  in  this\r\n\r\nendeavour.   I  would  also  like to suggest  that  for  greater\r\n\r\neffectiveness, life-long learning centres be brought to the  HDB\r\n\r\nheartlands where reach-out can be more extensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the Government's emphasis on\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure targeted at long-term benefits  in  this\r\n\r\nBudget.  However, I wish to note the need for us to monitor  and\r\n\r\nstrike  a fine balance between managing the economic crisis  and\r\n\r\nthe  push towards a KBE as there will be individuals as well  as\r\n\r\nbusinesses  who will become victims of the crisis to  whom  help\r\n\r\nneeds to be given to prevent them from losing hope.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy laid down\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nBudget  announcement has been well received by the business  and\r\n\r\nindustrial sectors and the community.  The Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nand  his  colleagues must be commended for the efforts to  steer\r\n\r\nSingapore's economy through trying times.  I must say  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  does not have an easy task nor does he  have  a  magic\r\n\r\nwand to wish the problem away.  He is indeed trying his best and\r\n\r\nwe  must  commend  him  for his efforts,  because  many  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems  are outside his control.  Because it is a  problem  of\r\n\r\nthe  region I therefore feel that what is most important is  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans - workers, employers, entrepreneurs and all that  - to  work  together and not bicker about the problems and  issues\r\n\r\nand  blame one another for them.  In doing so, we are not  going\r\n\r\nto  do good for Singapore.  What is most important for us is  to\r\n\r\nbrace  and  face  the  challenges ahead.  I  see  that  is  most\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam, who is not around here now, has argued that\r\n\r\ndemocracy  would provide economic growth and promote good  life.\r\n\r\nBut  from  what  I know many democracies have not produced  good\r\n\r\nlife.  And democracy without economic growth would not provide a\r\n\r\ngood  life  and  promote  better livelihood.   I  assert  it  is\r\n\r\nfundamental  that  we have good economic growth  in  order  that\r\n\r\ndemocracy  can survive.  I would also like to state that  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  important that we have our fundamentals right in the sense\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  have  to generate economic growth  in  order  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  pie, so that this could be redistributed  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the community to achieve a better life.   We  know\r\n\r\nthat  in  many places, if you look around, eg, in Asia, what  is\r\n\r\nimportant is not just democracy itself.  What is crucial  is  to\r\n\r\nhave  good social institutions and good leaders to manage  them.\r\n\r\nAnd  unless  and  until we have people with good  integrity  and\r\n\r\nhonesty  to manage these institutions and to be able to  prepare\r\n\r\nahead, to have good social and economic plans, I feel good lives\r\n\r\ncannot be achieved.  Many democracies have that empty talks and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  fulfilling the dreams and aspirations that the  people  are\r\n\r\naspiring  for.   We know that democracy cannot  just  depend  on\r\n\r\nempty  stomachs.  We cannot do that, because democracy on  empty\r\n\r\nstomach  means nothing.  We will first have to try and meet  the\r\n\r\nbasic  needs of the people, and it is very critical that we  try\r\n\r\nto  find different ways to generate economic growth.  If we  can\r\n\r\ndo  that,  then we will be able to promote better life  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I must say that our Government is\r\n\r\ndoing  the best it can, given the constraints that Singapore  is\r\n\r\nfacing.   We must admit that we are facing trying and  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.   There is no easy answer to the problems.   But  what  I\r\n\r\nhope is that Singaporeans can rally around, work together, think\r\n\r\nof  new innovative and creative ways, and find new opportunities\r\n\r\nahead,  to  help  us tackle the difficult and challenging  times\r\n\r\nthat we are facing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that we need to look at the Budget more closely\r\n\r\nand  I would like to pick up a few pockets of people whose needs\r\n\r\nhave  not been looked at more closely.  The first group  is  the\r\n\r\nemployability of older workers, ie, people who are less skilled.\r\n\r\nI  see  that the problems are real, and some of them  have  been\r\n\r\nretrenched.  We need to look at their needs more closely and pay\r\n\r\nattention  in  terms of how this group could  be  helped.   Many\r\n\r\nolder workers are likely to find difficulty in getting jobs  and\r\n\r\nit  is a pity that their contributions are not tapped.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  it would be desirable to provide more tax rebates  and\r\n\r\nincentives  for companies that are more prepared to  employ  and\r\n\r\nretain  older workers.  If we can do that, we will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide a wider opportunity for our unskilled and older workers.\r\n\r\nOlder  workers  who  are unskilled are also vulnerable  to  lose\r\n\r\ntheir jobs through relocation of companies to cheaper economies.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore  necessary at this point  to  try  and  create\r\n\r\nemployment  to  tap  some  of these semi-skilled  and  unskilled\r\n\r\nworkers who otherwise find great difficulty in employment.  So I\r\n\r\nhope  that  there  could be greater public  sector  creation  of\r\n\r\nemployment for this group of workers,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  in  the  private sector the jobs  are  shrinking  quite\r\n\r\ndramatically.  Therefore, I hope that one would be able to  look\r\n\r\nat this group of workers and see how they can be helped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to urge that the training grant be\r\n\r\nreviewed, particularly the tax rebate of $2,500 which  is  given\r\n\r\nfor  workers.   We  need to be more generous.  Perhaps  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Minister for Finance increase this tax  rebate\r\n\r\nto  $5,000  so  that  the older workers can  take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nretraining,  as some of the courses which enhance  their  skills\r\n\r\nwould  cost  more than $2,500.  Some generosity in this  respect\r\n\r\nwould be useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this connection too, I urge that the training\r\n\r\nallowance  for older workers at $500 could be reviewed,  because\r\n\r\nit is very difficult to encourage workers to go into training if\r\n\r\nthe  allowances  are marginal and are not attractive  enough  to\r\n\r\nsustain  them.   Sir,  the  next group  of  people  who  deserve\r\n\r\nattention are the pensioners who draw very low pension  of  less\r\n\r\nthan  $200.   Monthly pensions of less than $200 might  make  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for them to manage under trying times.   I  see  that\r\n\r\nthese  pensioners are stretched, if they have no other means  of\r\n\r\nsupport.   They are, in fact, no better than those  who  are  on\r\n\r\npublic   assistance.   Sir,  surely  this  group  of  pensioners\r\n\r\ndeserves  a better deal as they have given sterling services  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government and many of them served their best for  over  30\r\n\r\nyears.  I see that there is justification for a base-up revision\r\n\r\nof  their  pensions to meet at least a minimum  requirement  for\r\n\r\ntheir living.  These low income pensioners deserve a review -  I\r\n\r\nhave  been making pleas on their behalf over the years -  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that this will touch the Finance Minister's heart  and  he\r\n\r\nwould be able to do something for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another group is the 1- and 2-room families who have\r\n\r\nbeen  given PUB rebates from $50 to $100.  Many of these  people\r\n\r\nare in seasonal employment and they are also hit by the economic\r\n\r\nrecession.  They do deserve a review in terms of the PUB rebates\r\n\r\nand perhaps the PUB rebates for 1-, 2- and 3-rooms could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  standardised to $200.  This, I think, will help to alleviate\r\n\r\nsome of their problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last group which requires our attention is those families\r\n\r\nwhich  have to look after their aged sick parents.   I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry  of Health is planning  to  subsidise  these\r\n\r\nfamilies.   However, this move would not be able to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nburden of those families in the sandwich income group who  faces\r\n\r\nfinancial  burden in the increasing cost of nursing  care.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of families with aged sick parents will increase steeply\r\n\r\nin  the near future.  In this case, we have to try and find ways\r\n\r\nin  which  we could relieve the burden through more tax rebates,\r\n\r\nso  that  their aged sick parents need not be institutionalised.\r\n\r\nSubstitute  care can be implemented and other alternative  forms\r\n\r\nof  support  can be mobilised in order that they can  be  looked\r\n\r\nafter within the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Minister would be able to look at the few\r\n\r\nsuggestions that I have given.  It is not going to cost too much\r\n\r\noutlay.   But it will cost some outlay.  I hope that he will  be\r\n\r\nable  to extend assistance to these groups of people who I  have\r\n\r\nrequested him to help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, I would like to support the Budget Statement,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Budget announced by the Finance Minister  this\r\n\r\nyear  has  not drawn much reaction from our people because  last\r\n\r\nyear  the Government had already announced packages to deal with\r\n\r\nthe  currency and economic crisis.  The reaction by  our  people\r\n\r\nillustrates  the maturity of our people and their confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  of  Singapore.   More  importantly,  whenever  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  makes  any  important  decision,  they  would  first\r\n\r\ncommunicate   with   the   people  so   that   they   could   be\r\n\r\npsychologically prepared for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, this Budget has basically looked after the needs of\r\n\r\nour  people  in this time of crisis.  According to some  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers, many seminars or talks were conducted over the past one\r\n\r\nto two years,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  they  are  aware that the Government has been planning  for\r\n\r\ntheir future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers are concerned with more long-term issues. From the\r\n\r\nfeedback we have received, it appears that our workers want  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to provide them with more opportunities  to  acquire\r\n\r\nthe  necessary skills to cope with the challenges ahead  as   we\r\n\r\nare evolving into a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When computer was just a calculating machine, our Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has already established the National Computer  Board\r\n\r\n(NCB)  to actively promote computerisation.  So when IT is going\r\n\r\nto  be the security for our survival, should we not upgrade  NCB\r\n\r\nto a higher profile Ministry of IT Power?  I feel that we should\r\n\r\nhave  a  Ministry  to be overall in charge of all  our  computer\r\n\r\nresources.   We  should have a designated Ministry  to  monitor,\r\n\r\nsupervise  and  manage the upgrading and evaluation  of  our  IT\r\n\r\nneeds  and also to maximize the effects of IT on our social  and\r\n\r\neconomic development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Technology (IT) has advanced very rapidly and\r\n\r\nhas  a  great impact on our life.  From telephone to television,\r\n\r\nfrom  study to work, from shopping to investment, from  Internet\r\n\r\nto e-commerce, IT has affected almost every aspect of our lives.\r\n\r\nVarious  ministries,  statutory boards, departments and agencies\r\n\r\nof  the Government, such as the NCB, PSB, Ministry of Education,\r\n\r\nTAS, SBA, MITA have also put in a concerted effort to popularise\r\n\r\nIT  among  our people.  Looking at the future, would it  not  be\r\n\r\nbetter if we have a centralised authority to  take charge of the\r\n\r\noverall planning and implementation of the national IT policies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have to actively and strenuously promote IT\r\n\r\ntechnology?   We  need  to do so because this  will  give  us  a\r\n\r\nleading  edge  in  a  knowledge economy.  As  a  small  country,\r\n\r\nwhether or not we could lead in the world of a knowledge economy\r\n\r\nwould  depend  on two factors:  first, the general  standard  of\r\n\r\neducation  of  our  people, and secondly, the general  level  of\r\n\r\napplication of IT among our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople.  When we have more people using IT, productivity will go\r\n\r\nup.  For example, engineers or doctors could use 3-D imaging  to\r\n\r\nmore accurately and quickly make diagnosis and decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, e-commerce has become a new mode of business transactions.\r\n\r\nWith more people possessing IT skills, they will be able to work\r\n\r\nsmarter and faster. They will then have more leisure time to  be\r\n\r\nwith  their families or to upgrade themselves.  With more people\r\n\r\npossessing  IT  skills, their employability will be  better  and\r\n\r\nproductivity of the various companies and factories would go up.\r\n\r\nThis would enhance our competitiveness, and our world ranking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we help Singapore to attain such a target and to\r\n\r\nsupervise the implementation of such an effort?  There are  many\r\n\r\nforeign organisations that have been evaluating us from time  to\r\n\r\ntime.  But  which ministry or agency  in Singapore can  evaluate\r\n\r\nour level of application of IT in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we would have to promote IT to our students\r\n\r\nbecause   the  students  are  the  life-force  for  our  future.\r\n\r\nRecently,  the Minister for Education announced the IT Education\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan  and  the Finance Minister has generously  allotted\r\n\r\nmore  than $5 billion to invest in education.  I think we should\r\n\r\nhave  more resources available to promote IT in our schools  and\r\n\r\nthen our school principals would not have to worry that there is\r\n\r\nnot enough money to use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of the E-commerce blueprint and NCB  set  up  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  ONE  integrated network.  EDB,  TDB,  PSB  have  also\r\n\r\nintroduced  various incentive schemes.  NTUC and  PA  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen very active in promoting IT and related skills training.  I\r\n\r\ndo  no think there is any other country in the world that has so\r\n\r\nmany ministries and government agencies working hand in hand and\r\n\r\nwith such a high profile to promote IT among the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the non-professionals, they are the people with potential\r\n\r\neconomic  values.  Our housewives have helped us to manage  warm\r\n\r\nhomes  for the families, and  to pass on our traditional  values\r\n\r\nto  the  next  generation.   As  for  the  retirees,  they  have\r\n\r\ncontributed towards the building up of our nation to what it  is\r\n\r\ntoday.  They  have a rich experience which we did not  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to live through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they are housewives or retirees, or even the less\r\n\r\nfortunate  handicapped people, so long as they have the  ability\r\n\r\nto  apply  IT,  they  can  upgrade  themselves  and  make  their\r\n\r\ncontribution to our knowledge-type production activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we have provided a lot of hardware to our\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations.  However, in  order  to  receive  the\r\n\r\narrival  of  the  era of a knowledge economy, we should  provide\r\n\r\nmore  training to the grassroots leaders and their staff so that\r\n\r\nthey  could  have a more systematic knowledge of  IT,  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  they may be able to effectively  lead a new generation  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Perhaps, if we look five or 10 years  ahead,   we\r\n\r\nwould  wonder  if it would not be more effective if  we  have  a\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  be  overall  in  charge  of  IT  applications   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not an expert but just an ordinary user of IT. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to make some suggestions.  How do we promote? In the past,\r\n\r\nour  Singapore  Government has its \"Home  for  Everyone\"  scheme\r\n\r\nwhich  is  well  known throughout the world and our  people  are\r\n\r\nhappy to have their own homes. Perhaps, as we step into the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury,  we could have a \"Computer for Every Home\" scheme.   We\r\n\r\nmay  perhaps  want to help every family living in a 3-room  flat\r\n\r\nand  below  to own a computer.  At present,  about  50%  of  our\r\n\r\nfamilies have their own computers.  We are slightly better  than\r\n\r\nLondon because London is only 37%.  Perhaps, we should set up an\r\n\r\nunprecedented target of 80% of our families owning computers  in\r\n\r\nthree years' time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we could have smart-type HDB flats. Under NCB's IT\r\n\r\n2000 scheme, Singapore is going to become an intelligent island. At \r\n\r\npresent, many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommercial buildings are being rebuilt\r\n\r\nas  intelligent buildings.  HDB may perhaps try a pioneer scheme\r\n\r\nto   design  some  intelligent-type  flats  conducive   to   the\r\n\r\napplication of computers at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, JTC may perhaps develop some \"intelligent-type\r\n\r\nfactories\", providing our  SMEs with e-commerce packages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we may look into the possibility of providing\r\n\r\nintelligent-type bus service or intelligent-type MRT service  on\r\n\r\nboard buses or trains so that commuters could use the facilities\r\n\r\nto  surf  the Internet or send e-mail on their way to office  or\r\n\r\nreturning home after work. Students could also make use of these\r\n\r\nfacilities to do their own work even before they reach home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if we want to promote IT, we must promote it to\r\n\r\neverybody.   Today,  in  Singapore, even  the  vegetable  seller\r\n\r\naunties  could  make use of the TV Teletext to check  their  4-D\r\n\r\nwinning  numbers.  Perhaps, in future, we can help the vegetable\r\n\r\nseller   aunties   to   access  the   websites,    to   download\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  course  materials  and  submit  their   homework\r\n\r\nthrough  the Internet.  Some workers told me that if we want  to\r\n\r\nencourage  everybody  to  use IT,  to  use  Internet,  the  most\r\n\r\neffective method is to allow them to place their bets on 4-D  or\r\n\r\nTOTO on-line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, our people hope that one day, our home can be a\r\n\r\n\"intelligent\" home.  Even when we are working, we  can  remotely\r\n\r\ncontrol the appliances at home, for example, to cook rice,  bake\r\n\r\na  cake, etc.  So it will become an IT-type style of living.  We\r\n\r\nmust  let everybody possess the skills to use computers so  that\r\n\r\nthey  could  more  effectively  participate  in  all  these   IT\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: who should be overall in charge of all the IT\r\n\r\napplications  in  Singapore?  If we want to provide  world-class\r\n\r\ninformation service, like our airport and seaport, we must  have\r\n\r\na  world-class information infrastructure.  Take,  for  example,\r\n\r\nour  \"Information Super Highway\" system.  It is  like  our  land\r\n\r\ntransport.  There must never be traffic jams along the  highway.\r\n\r\nSo  when  our  people surf the net from one website to  another,\r\n\r\nthey should  be  able  to  access the desired\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwebsite  within  three\r\n\r\nseconds.   According to feedback from some users,  although  our\r\n\r\ninformation  infrastructure  has attained  a  leading  standard,\r\n\r\nsometimes  we still need  to wait 20 to 30 seconds  to  go  into\r\n\r\ncertain  websites  in  Singapore.  There  are  frequent  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestions.   We  must  constantly  monitor  and  upgrade   our\r\n\r\nfacilities  so  that our people will not have to waste  precious\r\n\r\ntime  waiting for the congestion to clear.  So, which Government\r\n\r\nauthority  should be in charge or be responsible to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthere is no traffic jam, and when traffic congestion appears  to\r\n\r\nbe  building  up, to  upgrade our information infrastructure  to\r\n\r\nclear the jam?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also set up new indexes and some means to measure the\r\n\r\nlevel  of  application  of IT in Singapore.   For  example,  the\r\n\r\nLianhe  Zaobao website has more than 30 million hits per  month.\r\n\r\nApart  from people in Singapore, there are also people from  all\r\n\r\nover the world who browse and visit the Lianhe Zaobao site.   So\r\n\r\nwith  more  people  accessing  our Lianhe  Zaobao  website,  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper's  status  would  go up  and  it  would  attract  more\r\n\r\nadvertisements,  and  hence  more  revenue!   With  more  people\r\n\r\naccessing the Singapore websites, the status of our nation  will\r\n\r\nalso  go up and our economy will be stronger.  We should perhaps\r\n\r\nset  up  a  certain  target  to measure  how  many  websites  in\r\n\r\nSingapore has received more than 20 million visits per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the Ministry of Education, MOM, MTI, MITA,\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Communications, MND, are all developing  their  own\r\n\r\nplans  to promote the use of IT.  I feel very strongly  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  have a Ministry to coordinate all these activities.   At\r\n\r\nthe moment, every Ministry is carrying out activities to develop\r\n\r\ntheir  IT  applications,  using the guidelines  issued  by  NCB.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  should  be more practical  guidelines  to  keep\r\n\r\nabreast of the times. For example, I know of a civil servant who\r\n\r\ntook  his  children to Funan Centre to buy a Pentium  III.  But,\r\n\r\nback in his office in a Government department,  the computer  on\r\n\r\nhis  desk  is  just  a  486.  If you go to  Funan  Centre,   the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers there will tell you 486 is so far obsolete  that  it\r\n\r\nhas become\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nextinct in Funan Centre,  but this 486 is still very much  alive\r\n\r\non the office desk of this poor civil servant.  This is no good.\r\n\r\nWe  should  have some plans to upgrade and replace our computers\r\n\r\nin the Government offices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our computer is no longer just a computer. It is a bridge or a\r\n\r\nwindow for our people to have a lifelong learning process or  it\r\n\r\nmay  even set new policy and direction.  We should set a  target\r\n\r\nof,  say,  once  in   every three years,  we  must  replace  the\r\n\r\ncomputers  in our Government offices.  Although this  may  incur\r\n\r\nsome heavy expenditure, it just cannot be helped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have a centralised Ministry to be overall in charge and\r\n\r\ncoordinate  the  replacement of computers in all the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments, community clubs, community centres and the People's\r\n\r\nAssociation, our civil servants and public officers   will  have\r\n\r\ntheir  computers  replaced, from time to time, with  the  latest\r\n\r\nmodels  and the best capabilities available, it would  certainly\r\n\r\nenhance their productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, when not many families have computers at home, the\r\n\r\nGovernment used various channels such as the community  centres,\r\n\r\nRC  centres,  etc.  to  promote the use of computers  by  making\r\n\r\navailable  the  facilities  in  their  computer  rooms  to   the\r\n\r\nresidents.  Five years from now, when almost every family has  a\r\n\r\ncomputer  at home, the CCs and RCs should equip themselves  with\r\n\r\nmore  high-end  computers  that an  ordinary  family  could  not\r\n\r\nafford.   Only then can we attract a new generation of residents\r\n\r\nto  come  forward  and  make use of the latest  technology.   We\r\n\r\nshould  have a Ministry to be overall in charge, to provide  the\r\n\r\nbudget and to monitor and supervise such projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that when the computer\r\n\r\nwas  just  an  apparatus for doing calculation, we  had  already\r\n\r\nestablished  the  National Computer Board  to  actively  promote\r\n\r\ncomputerisation.  So now when IT has become the security for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsurvival,  should  we not upgrade NCB, TAS, SBA,  etc;,  related\r\n\r\norganisations, to become a centralised ministry like a  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  IT  Power  to  be  overall in charge of all  aspects  of  IT\r\n\r\napplications  in  Singapore?  I hope  my  suggestions  would  be\r\n\r\nseriously considered by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, at no\r\n\r\nother  time than in the midst of an economic crisis do  we  feel\r\n\r\nmost  strongly the bond of citizenship that ties us together  as\r\n\r\none   community,  one  nation,  as  Singaporeans.   Through  the\r\n\r\neconomic and political uncertainties in the region, hardship due\r\n\r\nto  retrenchments and reduction in income, and the sheer grit to\r\n\r\nbe   on  top  of  the  challenges  and  to  stay  ahead  of  our\r\n\r\ncompetitors, I believe Singaporeans have become closer together.\r\n\r\nWhile  the feeling is that the people have become closer to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, their expectation of the Government has also  grown.\r\n\r\nWe  begin  to demand much more from the Government than  we  did\r\n\r\nwhen  the economy was booming and growing, when times were good.\r\n\r\nSo,  in good times people expect a lot from the Government,  and\r\n\r\nin bad times, perhaps a lot more.  Perhaps this is expected of a\r\n\r\ngood  Government,  which means so much more  to  the  people  in\r\n\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Government has indeed come through with several\r\n\r\nschemes and programmes to assist those in economic difficulty  - to  help  our  people deal with the difficult situation.   These\r\n\r\nschemes   and   programmes  comprise  outright   assistance   to\r\n\r\nindividuals  as  well as indirect assistance to keep  businesses\r\n\r\nalive  in  Singapore,  through incentives  and  tax  cuts.   For\r\n\r\nbusinesses, they are structurally well able to take advantage of\r\n\r\nthe  different  Government  programmes,  some  to  maintain   an\r\n\r\nexistence  until  good times come again, while others  take  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to grow and generate more business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has not escaped the people that this Government\r\n\r\ncares  for  them.  The tax rebate and the rebate on service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy  charges  are  cases  in  point.   They  are  really\r\n\r\nimportant at a time when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  workers have sacrificed in terms of wage and CPF cuts.  The\r\n\r\nHDB heartlanders who may not pay income tax or pay little of it,\r\n\r\nI believe, do appreciate the rebate on conservancy charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree with the Prime Minister and some speakers before\r\n\r\nme  that  we must help and take care of each other in  times  of\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  To start with, the social safety net in Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been excellent.  No one has been forced to be on the street\r\n\r\nwhen  he  is  out  of  employment as  the  HDB  allows  mortgage\r\n\r\nrepayment  scheme that is sympathetic to them.  The children  of\r\n\r\nsuch  workers would also not have to leave school as  there  are\r\n\r\nassistance schemes for them to pay their school fees.  Those who\r\n\r\nfall  sick  and  really cannot pay their hospitalisation  bills,\r\n\r\nthey  too  have  not been turned away just because  they  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  it.   For individuals, especially the sole  breadwinners\r\n\r\naffected  by  the  economic crisis,  ie,  those  who  have  been\r\n\r\nretrenched, forced into bankruptcy or those who have  had  their\r\n\r\nsalaries  reduced, a comprehensive scheme of referral  and  help\r\n\r\nwould  assist  them  to  overcome the  tremendous  psychological\r\n\r\nimpact of these difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, there are several different programmes devised by\r\n\r\nthe Government or community organisations, but the individual in\r\n\r\ndespair is usually likely not to know where or how to begin.  To\r\n\r\nbe  more  effective, organisations like the CDCs could create  a\r\n\r\none-stop  centre  with trained officers to  advise  and  counsel\r\n\r\nthose  adversely affected by the economic crisis, steering  them\r\n\r\ntowards  Government and community programmes which are available\r\n\r\nand  suitable for their needs.  These officers could then  cater\r\n\r\nto  the individual's specific needs as such a person has certain\r\n\r\nproblems  which are particular and peculiar to him or her.   For\r\n\r\nunion  members, there are less problems as our network of unions\r\n\r\nhas  schemes  to help members find alternative jobs  and  render\r\n\r\nrelief  assistance to the retrenched.  But only about a  quarter\r\n\r\nof  our workers are union members, and in the larger context, we\r\n\r\nshould help our fellow Singaporeans in a more coordinated way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our vision of a caring society, we need more than just\r\n\r\nthe  solutions to an individual's predicament.  We also need  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  \"doctor\"  who  will bridge  the  gap  between  the\r\n\r\n\"disease\"  and the \"medicine\".  We need a systemic  approach  to\r\n\r\nthe  situation rather than the laudable but ad-hoc actions.   We\r\n\r\nshould  have  officers in agencies like the CDCs, officers  with\r\n\r\nthe  heart  in  the  right places, to guide  and  advise  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   who  have  lost  their  jobs   and   are   facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an employers' market, the individual is helpless in the\r\n\r\nface of discrimination.  Discrimination, be it along the line of\r\n\r\nrace, gender or age, can become the root of contradiction to the\r\n\r\nbonds of citizenship that I spoke about earlier.  When employers\r\n\r\nfall  to temptation and take advantage of the present crisis  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  their  prejudices against specific sectors  of  people,\r\n\r\nthen Singapore as a nation becomes a sham.  That is not what  we\r\n\r\naspire  for  Singapore.   Luckily,  this  is  not  a  widespread\r\n\r\npractice.   I  do not think that we are seeing the worsening  of\r\n\r\nthis  situation.   But  when  jobs  are  more  scarce  and   the\r\n\r\nretrenched take more time to get alternative jobs, such form  of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  becomes more glaring.  The  question  before  us\r\n\r\nthen  is:  should we legislate against discrimination as in  the\r\n\r\nUnited States?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue against this. We do have in place\r\n\r\ninstruments   to   counter   outright   prejudices,   like   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Council  for  Minority  Rights.   Legislation   to\r\n\r\nimplement  the kinds of laws that enforce equal opportunity  can\r\n\r\nbe damaging to race relations which is already a sensitive issue\r\n\r\nin   a  multi-ethnic  nation  like  Singapore.   This  kind   of\r\n\r\nlegislation  can  lead to the polarisation  of  society  through\r\n\r\nconfrontation  as  it dictates the correct  responses  with  the\r\n\r\nlikely  result of anger and cynicism.  The better path would  be\r\n\r\neducation and persuasion, that it is in the best interest of our\r\n\r\nsociety and our nation when there is respect for age, for women,\r\n\r\nfor  those  who are handicapped and for people of  other  races.\r\n\r\nThis can and should be taught, especially in a still developing,\r\n\r\nyoung society like Singapore.  I am glad that Government leaders\r\n\r\nlike Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan, have spoken\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagainst  discriminatory practices at workplaces.  We  must  send\r\n\r\nthe  right  signals that discrimination along the line  of  age,\r\n\r\ngender or race is also not acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must be provided with the necessary education\r\n\r\nand  training  to  see  that  discrimination  in  any  form   is\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the refinement of our society.  We should make it\r\n\r\neven  more possible for Singaporeans of different racial  groups\r\n\r\nand social status to work with and support each other.  Our self-help  organisations should be provided with  the  incentives  to\r\n\r\nopen  the  doors  of their services to members of  other  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should also try to ensure that what I\r\n\r\nconsider  as `manpower leakage' is reduced.  I am talking  about\r\n\r\ndrop-outs  from  our  education system.   Over  the  years,  our\r\n\r\neducation   system  is  designed  to  ensure  that   all   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans obtain a good basic education and skills  training.\r\n\r\nAt  a  time when we are worried about the vulnerability  of  our\r\n\r\nolder  workers  to  the structural changes of  our  economy,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to see our young people wasting the  educational\r\n\r\nand  training  opportunities open to them  in  our  schools  and\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   Instead, we should push towards  greater  value-added performances by students and schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to go back to a point I made earlier about\r\n\r\nhow  people expect so much from the Government, both in good and\r\n\r\nbad  times.  At a time when we are talking about re-skilling our\r\n\r\nworkers,  instead  of giving outright rebates,  should  not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment consider giving away the goodies in the form that can\r\n\r\nbe used for skills training by our workers?  In short, we should\r\n\r\nre-visit the idea of \"skillsave\" for workers along the same line\r\n\r\nthat we give Edusave to our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, NMP Mr Gerard Ee had earlier said that while we help\r\n\r\nour  people prepare for the future challenges, we must not  lose\r\n\r\nsight  of  their current difficulties.  I would like to  take  a\r\n\r\nlook  at  the other side of the coin.  The point I am making  is\r\n\r\nthat  while  we  earnestly  help the needy  in  these  times  of\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  we must not lose sight of the long-term  problems\r\n\r\nand  challenges facing our economy.  We must help  our  old  and\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans to re-tool themselves with the  skills  that\r\n\r\nare  relevant for the future.  This is in their own interest and\r\n\r\nin the interest of our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the raising of these issues is fundamental to the\r\n\r\nkind of society we wish to progress towards.  It is perhaps  the\r\n\r\nsilver  lining in the economic recession that we are faced  with\r\n\r\ntoday  when  such issues come into sharper focus and we  realise\r\n\r\nthe need to address them to advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate be now adjourned. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Hu, debate to be resumed on what\r\n\r\nday?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Fifteen Minutes past</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Five o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
