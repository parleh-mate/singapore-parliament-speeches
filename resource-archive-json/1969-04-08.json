The  items\r\n\r\nincluded for regular pricing were selected based on a\r\n\r\nHousehold   Expenditure  Survey  conducted   by   the\r\n\r\nStatistics  Department  and  generally  reflect   the\r\n\r\nconsumption  pattern  of the average  household.  For\r\n\r\nperishable  foodstuffs, e.g.,  meat,  poultry,  fish,\r\n\r\nfruits  and  vegetables, prices are collected  weekly\r\n\r\nfrom  market-stalls in eight markets in the Republic.\r\n\r\nIn  the  case of non-perishable foodstuffs where  the\r\n\r\nprices  are  normally not subject to  frequent  daily\r\n\r\nfluctuations,  e.g.,  rice  and  sundry   provisions,\r\n\r\nprices are collected twice a month from retail  shops\r\n\r\ndistributed in the main shopping centres. A total  of\r\n\r\nabout  140  items are covered in this  regular  price\r\n\r\ncollection, and the data are primarily used  for  the\r\n\r\ncompilation  of  the  Consumer Price  Index.

In compiling the index, specific  care  is\r\n\r\ntaken to exclude the influence on prices arising from\r\n\r\nthe  variations  in  locality,  quality  of  product,\r\n\r\nbuyer/seller relationship and the bargaining capacity\r\n\r\nof  customers,  which are important factors  directly\r\n\r\naffecting the personal shopper in the market.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations will still obtain even if the\r\n\r\ndata  are  collected  daily and  will  therefore  not\r\n\r\nprovide the kind of guidance to the consuming  public\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Kallang would desire.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this and of the expenses that would be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  a  daily  collection  of  data,  it  is\r\n\r\nconsidered uneconomical to employ a large  number  of\r\n\r\nstaff and resources to undertake such an exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOUSE ASSESSMENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Disparity)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

We should move  slowly\r\n\r\ntowards  this  position and are, in fact,  doing  so.\r\n\r\nWhen  occupiers of quarters retire, or resign or  are\r\n\r\ndismissed, it is the intention not to rent out  these\r\n\r\nquarters to other employees but rent them out to  the\r\n\r\npublic  at  economic rents.

This does not necessarily mean  that  all\r\n\r\nemployees  declared redundant can be  retrained.  The\r\n\r\nlimited   resources   of  the   Technical   Education\r\n\r\nDepartment are at the moment fully taken up  in  this\r\n\r\ntask.  It  must  be  pointed out  that  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ntraining  is high and, therefore, it is the intention\r\n\r\nof  the Government to recover the training cost  from\r\n\r\nthe British Government under the special aid scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not propose to provide a\r\n\r\nretraining  scheme  for  retrenched  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector because the number involved  is  very\r\n\r\nsmall.  Further, a retraining scheme  for  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the private sector would  call  for  the\r\n\r\nprovision of substantial funds.

The Secretariat  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission has informed me that the sum of $1,499,370\r\n\r\nis available for the award of scholarships, bursaries\r\n\r\nand  interest-free study loans to students  in  post-secondary  educational institutions for  the  current\r\n\r\nfinancial year, which runs from January 1969 to March\r\n\r\n1970. Worked on a proportionate basis the amount  for\r\n\r\nthis  year  is  $1,199,500. The Member for  Sembawang\r\n\r\nmight like to know that last year a sum of $1,176,000\r\n\r\nwas made available for similar awards. The number  of\r\n\r\nawards  for  this year will depend on  the  budgetted\r\n\r\nprovision as well as on the number of applicants  who\r\n\r\nhave    good   records   in   academic    work    and\r\n\r\nextracurricular activities and who deserve  financial\r\n\r\nassistance. The Member for Sembawang will  appreciate\r\n\r\nthat the actual number of awards to be made will only\r\n\r\nbe   known   later   after  all  the   post-secondary\r\n\r\neducational  institutions have admitted students  for\r\n\r\nthe 1968/69 session.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the basis of award of scholarships,\r\n\r\nbursaries   and  study  loans,  the  Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission tells me this will vary with each type  of\r\n\r\naward.    President's    scholarships    and    Merit\r\n\r\nscholarships  are  awarded on the basis  of  academic\r\n\r\nexcellence   in   the   Higher   School   Certificate\r\n\r\nExamination   and  on  outstanding   performance   in\r\n\r\nextracurricular  activities.  Merit   bursaries   are\r\n\r\nawarded  on the basis of merit alone irrespective  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  circumstances. On the other hand,  special\r\n\r\nbursaries  for  Malays are awarded on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  need.

But\r\n\r\nwhat  are its objectives? A full explanation  of  its\r\n\r\nunderlying  purposes will be given  when  I  come  to\r\n\r\nelaborate on its provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me give a reason why it is necessary to\r\n\r\nreform and liberalise our laws on abortion. Our  laws\r\n\r\non  abortion are based on the old Indian  Penal  Code\r\n\r\nwhich in turn was derived from English law, Even  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  have liberalised their laws on  abortion  by\r\n\r\nthe  passage  o' the United Kingdom Abortion  Act  of\r\n\r\n1967 which became operative on 27th April, 1968.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law on abortion in Singapore is found\r\n\r\nin our Penal Code. The relevant sections are sections\r\n\r\n312  to  316  and  section 511  of  the  Penal  Code.\r\n\r\nLegally,  an abortion is the expulsion of the  foetus\r\n\r\nfrom  the uterus at any time before the full term  of\r\n\r\npregnancy. To induce an abortion, i.e., an artificial\r\n\r\nabortion,  is  a  statutory  crime.  The  problem  of\r\n\r\ninduced  abortion is that it is governed by  criminal\r\n\r\nlaw rather than medical knowledge.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law in Singapore does not specifically recognise\r\n\r\nany interference with pregnancy on any grounds except\r\n\r\n\"in good faith for the purpose of saving the lifc  of\r\n\r\nthe  woman\", it  has, however, been  interpreted  by\r\n\r\ngeneral  definition and by judicial  authority,  that\r\n\r\nthe  phrase  \"to  save life\" has the meaning  of  \"to\r\n\r\npreserve  health\", and since life depends on  health,\r\n\r\nabortions  may be performed to preserve the  physical\r\n\r\nand  mental  health of the mother.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\ninduced  abortion  may be done  for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ntreatment  and these are usually termed  \"therapeutic\r\n\r\nabortions\".\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial precedent, however, forms a rather flimsy\r\n\r\nbasis  for  the performance of therapeutic abortions.\r\n\r\nIt  is said that the law cannot expect medicine to be\r\n\r\npractised under sufferance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, therefore, an obstetrician\r\n\r\ncan  be  considered  to  have  infringed  it  in  the\r\n\r\nperformance of an abortion other than for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  saving  the  life of the pregnant woman.  If  his\r\n\r\naction  is  ever  questioned,  his  sole  defence  to\r\n\r\njustify  his  action in performing the  operation  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  not only for the reason  that  it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary in his opinion, but also to prove  that  it\r\n\r\nwas done to save the life of the mother.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law, therefore, presents serious\r\n\r\nconflicts  to  the practitioner -between  a  duty  to\r\n\r\nserve the patient and a duty to obey the law. Doctors\r\n\r\nwho are fearful of the possible consequences may fail\r\n\r\nto  recommend termination of pregnancy. The result is\r\n\r\nthat an abortion which should be done for the sake of\r\n\r\nthe  mother is not done, or if done is done too  late\r\n\r\nand when the pregnant woman's life is endangered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to correct the present legal\r\n\r\nambiguities  by  stating in clear terms  the  medical\r\n\r\nconditions under which abortions can be performed; to\r\n\r\npermit  the prompt operation which will be  performed\r\n\r\nunder the best possible conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of the Bill is to promote the well-being\r\n\r\nof  the  woman and to avoid impairment of her health,\r\n\r\nin the interests of humanity and human progress.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, therefore, seeks to codify what is now\r\n\r\ngenerally   accepted  as  the  medical  reasons   for\r\n\r\ntreatment  by termination of pregnancy. In  clause  5\r\n\r\n(2)   (a)  the  conditions  under  which  therapeutic\r\n\r\nabortion can be done are unambiguously stated. It may\r\n\r\nbe done where the pregnancy would involve risk to the\r\n\r\nlife  of the pregnant woman or injury to her physical\r\n\r\nor mental health.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common practice where two practitioners consult\r\n\r\ntogether  before termination of pregnancy is  advised\r\n\r\nis  also recognised under clause 5 (3) which provides\r\n\r\nfor  an abortion if two practitioners in consultation\r\n\r\nand,  acting in good faith, advise that the  abortion\r\n\r\nis necessary on medical grounds.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in clause 5 (5) , a medical practitioner may\r\n\r\nterminate  pregnancy  in an  emergency  where  it  is\r\n\r\nimmediately necessary to save the life or to  prevent\r\n\r\ngrave  permanent  injury to the  physical  or  mental\r\n\r\nhealth of the pregnant mother.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions therefore permit abortions if there\r\n\r\nis any medical reason to warrant an operation because\r\n\r\nsuch  an operation will safeguard the life and health\r\n\r\nof  the  mother.  It  does not need  any  complicated\r\n\r\narguments other than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommon  sense  to  tell us that  such  abortions  are\r\n\r\njustifiable  as there is no reason why  the  pregnant\r\n\r\nwoman  should be forced to go through the ordeal  and\r\n\r\nanguish  of  pregnancy  and  child  birth  which  can\r\n\r\nendanger  her life, or have serious repercussions  on\r\n\r\nher physical and mental health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other conditions on which the\r\n\r\ntermination  of  pregnancy may  be  authorised  under\r\n\r\nclause  5  (2) .  Let me first deal with  the  eugenic\r\n\r\nconsiderations.  There are several  conditions  which\r\n\r\nare  known  to carry a high risk of the  birth  of  a\r\n\r\nmentally handicapped child or the birth of a deformed\r\n\r\nchild normally termed a \"monster\" or the birth  of  a\r\n\r\n\"mongol\".  Certain  of  these are  due  to  inherited\r\n\r\nconditions. In others, the affliction might be due to\r\n\r\nan  infection  of the mother in the early  stages  of\r\n\r\npregnancy.   German  measles  in  a  pregnant   woman\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the  very early months  of  pregnancy\r\n\r\ncarries  a  high probability that the child  will  be\r\n\r\nborn with some severe abnormalities. Certain drugs or\r\n\r\nX-ray examinations taken in early pregnancy are  also\r\n\r\nknown  to cause such defects. The disastrous  effects\r\n\r\nof  the thalidomide drug is well known and are  still\r\n\r\nfresh in our memory.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conditions where there is a likelihood of the\r\n\r\nbirth of a mentally or physically deformed child, few\r\n\r\ncan  deny that it would be an act of kindness or even\r\n\r\na  moral  obligation  to avoid the  tragedy  and  the\r\n\r\nserious repercussions to the parents, the child,  and\r\n\r\nsociety  alike  by permitting abortion.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nfully  justified by a further reason that  it  is  an\r\n\r\nacknowledged social evil to countenance the  breeding\r\n\r\nof  defectives in society. This consideration may  be\r\n\r\ndescribed as the eugenic reason for abortion, and the\r\n\r\nprovision  is  embodied in clause 5 (2)  (c)  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there will always be the few who will on\r\n\r\nreligious   and  ethical  grounds  oppose  permitting\r\n\r\nabortion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven under these conditions. These minority groups in\r\n\r\ntheir opposition will no doubt advance their familiar\r\n\r\narguments  which  are  highly theoretical  and  often\r\n\r\nemotional, of divine creation and the sanctity of the\r\n\r\nfertilised  ovum  or  the  foetus  which   is   quite\r\n\r\ndifferent from a living person, (concepts which  have\r\n\r\nsprung  from  the Middle Ages and beyond).  To  enter\r\n\r\ninto  such  types  of arguments for  or  against,  to\r\n\r\njustify  or oppose abortion is, to my mind,  entirely\r\n\r\nfutile and to ignore completely the realities of  the\r\n\r\nmodern  world and its problems. I would just like  to\r\n\r\ninvite  these  groups to visit the  Mental  Defective\r\n\r\nSection  of  the  Woodbridge  Hospital  to  see   for\r\n\r\nthemselves the mental defectives or \"mongols\" whom we\r\n\r\nhave  to  care  for. Perhaps then they may  begin  to\r\n\r\nthink  in  more rational terms and start to  question\r\n\r\nthe  very purpose of the Divine creating such  mental\r\n\r\ndefectives,  the  nature of whose existence  in  this\r\n\r\nworld is just to vegetate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, where pregnancy has been caused by sexual\r\n\r\ncrimes such as rape, incest, or following intercourse\r\n\r\nwith  an insane or feeble-minded person, who  is  not\r\n\r\naccountable for her sexual responsibility,  abortions\r\n\r\non  humanitarian  grounds  will  be  permitted  under\r\n\r\nclause 5 (2) (d) of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the conditions which I have described, meaning\r\n\r\nthe  medical, eugenic and humanitarian considerations\r\n\r\nfor the termination of pregnancy, would be said to be\r\n\r\ngenerally  acceptable and justifiable on the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat  the  health  and  welfare  of  the  mother   is\r\n\r\nparamount and takes precedence over any consideration\r\n\r\nof the unborn foetus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a host of other conditions for\r\n\r\nwhich   women   seek  termination  of   an   unwanted\r\n\r\npregnancy.  Common  examples are  -  when  there  are\r\n\r\nalready  too  many children in the family,  when  the\r\n\r\naddition of yet another will mean inability to upkeep\r\n\r\nthe  family; when the pregnancy occurs too  close  to\r\n\r\nthe previous one; when the pregnancy will bring about\r\n\r\nsocial  ruin  as  when  the woman  is  unmarried,  is\r\n\r\ndeserted or when she is on the threshold of a  career\r\n\r\nor  when the woman is too young or too old; and  many\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the problem of an unwanted pregnancy, the\r\n\r\ngravity  of  which  only an ostrich  is  unaware.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there are people who would put on a straight\r\n\r\ncollar  and  moralise and argue that she should  have\r\n\r\nknown   better   or   that  she  should   bear   full\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  her  action.  Often  under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances  the  predicament and  anguish  of  the\r\n\r\nwoman  is ignored. It is all very easy to pontificate\r\n\r\non  someone else's predicament. The Bill faces up  to\r\n\r\nthis problem and offers a solution, by providing  for\r\n\r\nenvironmental or social considerations for permitting\r\n\r\nan abortion as set out in clause 5 (2) (b) .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since in our present law there is no such provision\r\n\r\nfor the performance of abortions for environmental or\r\n\r\nsocial  reasons,  the majority of  women  under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances  are  driven to seek  relief  from  the\r\n\r\nunwanted  pregnancy by resorting to dangerous  do-it-yourself home procedures or resort to back-street and\r\n\r\nillegal  abortionists, usually with  tragic  results.\r\n\r\nDoes  not  the real immorality lie in the restrictive\r\n\r\nlaws which drive women to illegal abortions?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the problem of illegal\r\n\r\nabortions in Singapore. Whereas the number of induced\r\n\r\nabortions  for medical reasons in the Kandang  Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital is small, the number done illicitly has been\r\n\r\nestimated at several thousands a year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criminal abortions in Singapore are not known\r\n\r\nbecause  obviously such figures are not available  as\r\n\r\nthey  are not reported. A study of criminal abortions\r\n\r\nadmitted into Kandang Kerbau Hospital for a six-month\r\n\r\nperiod in 1964 recorded 1,230 patients. Projected for\r\n\r\na  year the total number of abortions would have been\r\n\r\n2,500  in that year. This was a study made by Dr  Y.\r\n\r\nK. Lee for an M.D, thesis which was published in\r\n\r\n1965.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the total number of abortions is usually\r\n\r\nestimated to be 10 per cent of all pregnancies,  this\r\n\r\nwould  have worked out to about 6,000 a year in Singa\r\n\r\npore.  Of  these, 5,000 are estimated  to  have  been\r\n\r\ncriminally induced. This gives\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan incidence of 8.3 per cent of criminal abortions to\r\n\r\nall   pregnancies  in  Singapore.  The   figures   of\r\n\r\nabortions  from other countries vary  but  have  been\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  high and constituting a  major  health\r\n\r\nproblem, \"abortion being the greatest epidemic of our\r\n\r\ntimes\".  In  the United States it has been  estimated\r\n\r\nthat criminal abortions number one million a year, or\r\n\r\nnumber  in  the  region of one out of  four  or  five\r\n\r\npregnancies (20 per cent to 25 per cent).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom it has been variously\r\n\r\nestimated to number from 50,000 to 250,000 per  year.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Scandinavian  countries,  the  incidence  of\r\n\r\ncriminal  abortions is reported to be between  5  per\r\n\r\ncent and 10 per cent of all pregnancies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers of women submitting themselves to\r\n\r\ncriminal  abortions,  therefore,  run  into   several\r\n\r\nmillions throughout the world. A figure quoted is  25\r\n\r\nmillion  a  year (out of a total of 120 million  live\r\n\r\nbirths a year).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost in suffering and pain to the individual\r\n\r\nand the financial burden on the state must add up  to\r\n\r\nsomething  colossal. Since the laws are  flouted  and\r\n\r\nviolated  so  frequently, it might  he  assumed  that\r\n\r\nprosecutions would be numerous. Ironically  this  is,\r\n\r\nhowever, quite the contrary. Prosecution for criminal\r\n\r\nabortion  is  a rare occasion, and the conviction  of\r\n\r\none  is  even rarer still. In Singapore in  the  last\r\n\r\nfive  years, there were three prosecutions  and  only\r\n\r\none  conviction;  and it was not  a  doctor  who  was\r\n\r\nconvicted. It is often forgotten that no law  can  be\r\n\r\neffective unless it has the general approval  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The  widespread incidence of  criminal  abor\r\n\r\ntions  suggests not only that the law is  ineffective\r\n\r\nbut  also that abortion is generally approved by  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries which have recognised the demand for\r\n\r\nabortions for social reasons and have legalised them,\r\n\r\nthe   abortions  performed  for  these  reasons  form\r\n\r\napproximately  70  to 95 per cent  of  all  abortions\r\n\r\ndone.  Thus the problem to be faced up is  the  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  women who for one reason  or  other  are\r\n\r\nprepared to flout the laws and covertly seek out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   back-street  abortionist.  The  result  is  the\r\n\r\nterrible  cost to health and the tragic  consequences\r\n\r\nwhich  are all too well known. That is the  price  of\r\n\r\nillegal abortions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the prohibition of abortion has a\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  effect. For the rich,  who  have  the\r\n\r\nmeans,  seem  remarkably able  to  obtain  abortions.\r\n\r\nAmong  the  poor who cannot afford the high  fees  of\r\n\r\nillegal  abortions, resort is made to  the  untrained\r\n\r\nincompetents or the back-street abortionist, or  they\r\n\r\neven attempt it themselves, often with fatal results.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if I quote a number of real life examples to\r\n\r\nillustrate the desperation of our women in  Singapore\r\n\r\ncaught with an unwanted pregnancy, and the lengths to\r\n\r\nwhich  they  are  prepared to go to get  rid  of  the\r\n\r\npregnancy,  I  will be able to drive home  my  point.\r\n\r\nThese   examples  are  collected  from  a  study   on\r\n\r\nabortions made by Dr Y.

Thereafter,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  a hard object, e.g., a stone, is  pressed\r\n\r\nagainst  the  uterus and bound down  tightly  to  the\r\n\r\nabdomen  or  wedged into the pelvis.  Sometimes  this\r\n\r\ntechnique  is  combined with insertion of  a  foreign\r\n\r\nbody in the cervix.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have many more such examples, but because of the time factor, I think the examples that I have given will suffice at the moment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such examples of human anguish, suffering and tragedy perhaps may anger some at the unenlightened\r\n\r\nlaws on abortions that we have here. But they do also\r\n\r\nserve  to  put the arguments advanced on  ethical  or\r\n\r\nreligious  grounds of opposing abortion  under  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances in their proper perspective,  that  is,\r\n\r\nthese  opposing  arguments are in  comparison  rather\r\n\r\npetty and highly theoretical and academic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to popular belief, we can see from the\r\n\r\nexamples  that the majority of the women  who  sought\r\n\r\nillegal  abortions are married women who had  already\r\n\r\ntoo  many children and who for socio-economic reasons\r\n\r\nare  not able and cannot afford to face the birth  of\r\n\r\nanother  child. This category of women will certainly\r\n\r\ncome  under  the  clause which  will  allow  them  an\r\n\r\nabortion  on  socioeconomic grounds and thereby  save\r\n\r\nthem  front the suffering and the great risk to their\r\n\r\nlives in resorting to the back-street abortionist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to make it quite clear here that I\r\n\r\nam  not  claiming that the Bill will completely  wipe\r\n\r\nout  illegal abortions in Singapore. What I am saying\r\n\r\nis  that  clause 5 (2) (b) will offer an  alternative\r\n\r\nsolution  for  a  comparatively safe  abortion  under\r\n\r\naseptic conditions for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwoman who qualifies on socio-economic grounds and who\r\n\r\nwould otherwise in her desperation resort to the back-street  abortionist.  Needless  to  say,  this   will\r\n\r\ncertainly  reduce drastically the number  of  illegal\r\n\r\nabortions if it does not eliminate it altogether  and\r\n\r\nwith   it  the  consequent  toll  of  mortality   and\r\n\r\nmorbidity amongst our women.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill recognises these problems and faces up to\r\n\r\nthem  squarely. Clause S (2) (b) in fact  breaks  new\r\n\r\nground  by permitting abortion to be done for  purely\r\n\r\nsocial and economic reasons. This extends beyond  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  which appear in abortion  legislation  in\r\n\r\nthe   Scandinavian  countries,  (where  the  pregnant\r\n\r\nwoman's  environment  must be related  to  a  medical\r\n\r\nprognosis   -   i.e.,  abortion  on  a  socio-medical\r\n\r\nground). The Bill, however, is comparable to  similar\r\n\r\nprovisions  to  be found in abortion  legislation  in\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakia,  Poland and to he as  liberal  as  in\r\n\r\nJapan.  But it has not gone as far as the legislation\r\n\r\non abortion of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Hungary\r\n\r\nwhich authorise abortions on demand.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill recognises, however, the right of every\r\n\r\nwoman to choose when she wants a child; and the right\r\n\r\nto  have an abortion in case of an unwanted pregnancy\r\n\r\non socio-economic grounds.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion for social reasons would therefore speed\r\n\r\nthe  goal of making each child a wanted child; reduce\r\n\r\nthe  army  of  neglected and rejected  children;  and\r\n\r\n\"take  the  powder  out  of shot-gun  marriages\", in\r\n\r\nPoland, for example, the illegitimacy rate fell  from\r\n\r\n16 per 1,000 to 9 per 1,000 after the law was amended\r\n\r\npermitting abortions for social reasons.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion offered under these reasons certainly offer\r\n\r\na  substitute  of  a safe medical  procedure  for  an\r\n\r\nunsafe one offered by the illegal abortionist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion for social reasons would also remove the\r\n\r\nconditions  which  encourage the  flagrant  practice,\r\n\r\nthat ferment disrespect for the law.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to this stage the reasons I have advanced for\r\n\r\nintroducing the Bill have been those relating to  the\r\n\r\nhealth  and welfare of the pregnant woman or that  of\r\n\r\nher family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important as these reasons are and which alone\r\n\r\nwould  justify  the passing of this  Bill,  the  more\r\n\r\nfundamental  reason which should also be the  concern\r\n\r\nof  hon.  Members of this House who are charged  with\r\n\r\nthe   overall  welfare  of  the  community,  is   the\r\n\r\nunderlying social aims or objectives of the Bill. The\r\n\r\nreasons  so  far described pertain to the  individual\r\n\r\nand  the other reasons relevant to the community have\r\n\r\nnot  been  described. The former is based on  medical\r\n\r\nopinion  and  the welfare of the individual  and  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  while  the latter is based on the  community\r\n\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advancing the reasons for reforming the law,\r\n\r\npassing  reference was made to the  important  social\r\n\r\nreasons  affecting the community. The eugenic reasons\r\n\r\nfor  abortion, for example, would save the mother and\r\n\r\nher  family  the tragedy of the care of  a  defective\r\n\r\nchild.  But it also saves the state from the expenses\r\n\r\nof providing for the care of such children. For often\r\n\r\nthe   handicapped  children  are  abandoned,  or  the\r\n\r\nfamilies  require assistance in caring for them;  and\r\n\r\nexpensive  medical or institutional care is  required\r\n\r\nthroughout the life of the handicapped children.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  is even more important is that the bringing  up\r\n\r\nof   defectives  gradually  enlarges  the   pool   of\r\n\r\ndefectives in the population. As no civilised society\r\n\r\nwould  in  its conscience abandon such children,  the\r\n\r\nresult is that instead of breeding the best qualities\r\n\r\nin  our  population  the quality becomes  poorer.  We\r\n\r\nwill,   in  fact,  have  reversed  nature's  process.\r\n\r\nInstead of breeding the fittest for survival, we will\r\n\r\nbe breeding for our own decline.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, advocating the fundamental right of a woman to have an abortion if her family circumstances are not right for the birth of a child is not therefore made merely on grounds of principles, legal or otherwise. There is also the interest of the community. Underlying all this is\r\n\r\nthat every child\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nborn  in  our  Republic should be a wanted  child;  a\r\n\r\nchild that can be cared for, and provided for. It  is\r\n\r\nneedless  for  me  to  say that  decently  cared  and\r\n\r\nprovided children develop to their maximum potential,\r\n\r\nmake the most of the opportunities offered by society\r\n\r\nand  in return make a successful contribution to  it.\r\n\r\nConversely,  it  is  mainly from  the  ranks  of  the\r\n\r\nunwanted children, the illegitimate and broken  homes\r\n\r\nwhere most of the delinquents, the criminals and  the\r\n\r\nantisocial  elements  are  derived.  Our  society  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot  afford to breed such  people.  The\r\n\r\ncentral purpose of the Bill may, therefore, be stated\r\n\r\nthus: to assure the quality of life of children  born\r\n\r\nin  Singapore - to ensure that the children born  are\r\n\r\nwanted  children, being children who will be properly\r\n\r\ncared  for  and have opportunities for education  and\r\n\r\nthe  full development of their faculties so that they\r\n\r\ncan  grow up to lead meaningful lives and be usef iii\r\n\r\nmembers of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important benefit to our society that would\r\n\r\nresult  from this Bill would be to lower the rate  of\r\n\r\nour  population growth and help to tackle our problem\r\n\r\nof population explosion so that our population can be\r\n\r\nkept  in  bearable numbers where each has  reasonable\r\n\r\nexpectation of livelihood and a reasonable quality of\r\n\r\nlife.  However  let  me hasten  to  correct  any  mis\r\n\r\nconception  that may have arisen that  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nintended  to  control population growth  and  replace\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  by contraceptive  methods.  Let  me\r\n\r\nstate  now  categorically, as I have  stated  before,\r\n\r\nthat legalised abortion will not be a substitute  for\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  but will be a vital  complement  to\r\n\r\nprovide that ultimate security for the women who does\r\n\r\nnot wish to have the unwanted child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the countries of Eastern Europe and\r\n\r\nScandinavia  that  permitted  abortion  had  done  it\r\n\r\nprimarily to prevent the sad consequences of  illegal\r\n\r\nabortions and to enable the women to decide on  their\r\n\r\npregnancy  - and not in order to limit the population\r\n\r\n-  in  these countries it reduced the birth rate  con\r\n\r\nsiderably. Therefore, if in the process\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  operations of our proposed abortion law  our\r\n\r\npopulation increase is reduced, this would be one  of\r\n\r\nthe incidental benefits to our community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of the advantage of a lower rate of\r\n\r\npopulation growth for Singapore need not be  laboured\r\n\r\nas  it  is  all too evident in overcrowded Singapore.\r\n\r\nLet  me  only state that ours is an island of limited\r\n\r\narea  with one of the highest densities of population\r\n\r\nin  the  world -about 8,900 persons for every  square\r\n\r\nmile. And the population is increasing, although at a\r\n\r\ndecreasing rate, at 1.8 per cent a year. At this rate\r\n\r\nthe population which now stands at two million people\r\n\r\nwill  double  in about 39 years, i.e.,  by  about  AD\r\n\r\n2010. Steps must, therefore, be taken now to decrease\r\n\r\nfurther this rate of growth if we do not wish to face\r\n\r\nthe disastrous consequences of running out of land or\r\n\r\nbe reduced to penury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that the Government's family planning campaign has achieved tremendous success. Family planning has been generally accepted by the population as evidenced by the number of women attending the Government Family Planning clinics over the last two years. Since Government entered this\r\n\r\nfield of activity, attendances have been in excess of\r\n\r\nthe  target numbers. The dramatic falling birth rates\r\n\r\nare   due   to   the  acceptance  of  birth   control\r\n\r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some who argue that since family\r\n\r\nplanning is a success in Singapore there is therefore\r\n\r\nno  necessity to seek the aid of legalised  abortion.\r\n\r\nThe  answer to this is quite simple. Apart  from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the Bill is not intended as  a  means  of\r\n\r\npopulation control, there is an additional  important\r\n\r\nreason for the Bill. Contraceptive techniques are not\r\n\r\nyet  completely  effective. There are  failures  even\r\n\r\nthough  instructions are followed closely in any  one\r\n\r\nof   the   techniques  used.  It  would,   therefore.\r\n\r\nstimulate  the  practice of contraception  if  failed\r\n\r\ncontraception   is  regarded  as  a   criterion   for\r\n\r\nabortion.  It  would  be  logical  where  there   are\r\n\r\nfailures  in  the method used as advised or  provided\r\n\r\nthrough  Family  Planning  clinics  that  pregnancies\r\n\r\noccurring  should be allowed to be  aborted.  In  the\r\n\r\nstudies of women using\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe intra-uterine devices immediately after birth  at\r\n\r\nthe Kandang Kerbau Hospital, it was demonstrated that\r\n\r\n40  pregnancies have resulted out of 3,044 women; and\r\n\r\n177   pregnancies  out  of  5,694  women.  While   in\r\n\r\ndemographic  terms this was small,  between  two  and\r\n\r\nthree  per cent of the women, the problem is  a  real\r\n\r\none, and a personal tragedy. These women did not want\r\n\r\nto  be pregnant again. It is not known if they sought\r\n\r\ntermination of their pregnancy elsewhere. The concept\r\n\r\nof   failed  contraception  as  a  criterion  for   a\r\n\r\npermissive abortion would motivate more women to seek\r\n\r\nfamily planning advice and endeavour to follow it. In\r\n\r\nother  words, \"failed contraception\" is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  liberalising the laws on  abortion.  It\r\n\r\nwill  not be a substitute for family planning by  con\r\n\r\ntraceptive methods but a vital complement to  provide\r\n\r\nthat  ultimate  clinical security for the  woman  who\r\n\r\ndoes  not  wish to have an unwanted child.  Abortions\r\n\r\nshould  be  permitted as a logical and ultimate  step\r\n\r\nfor contraceptive failures.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is that this Bill must be looked upon as a\r\n\r\nsocial  Bill which must be regarded as an adjunct  to\r\n\r\nfamily  planning. In this respect, it  must  be  read\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the  Family Planning  and  Population\r\n\r\nBoard  Act,  1965, the Sterilization  Bill  which  is\r\n\r\nbeing introduced concurrently with the Abortion  Bill\r\n\r\nand  other  steps taken or will be taken to encourage\r\n\r\nsmall  families. Often people who criticise the  Bill\r\n\r\nignore  the  Sterilization Bill which is also  before\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I would like to deal with the\r\n\r\narguments against liberalising and reforming our  law \r\n\r\non  abortion. I must say that there has been quite  a \r\n\r\nlot of public debate and discussions going on on this \r\n\r\ncontroversial subject of abortion outside this  House even \r\n\r\nbefore the Bill was presented to Parliament.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, there have been quite  a  number  of\r\n\r\nloose arguments being bandied about resulting in some\r\n\r\nmisconceptions. I shall, of course,  try  to  correct\r\n\r\nthese misconceptions that have arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now dispose of the opposing arguments. No\r\n\r\ndoubt  some  hon. Members who oppose this  Bill  will\r\n\r\nadvance further arguments in the course of the debate\r\n\r\nin  this House. I shall, of course, deal with them in\r\n\r\nmy reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, opposition views fall under\r\n\r\nthree main categories:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first category is religious. Briefly the basis\r\n\r\nof objection is that abortions destroy the life of  a\r\n\r\nfoetus.  Since the foetus is the beginning  of  human\r\n\r\nlife,  induction of abortion is equivalent to murder.\r\n\r\nThis  is a matter of view-point. Learned men, medical\r\n\r\nor  otherwise, for centuries have not  been  able  to\r\n\r\nagree on whether the foetus is human life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view abortion is not murder. The destruction\r\n\r\nof  the  early conceptus differs in no essential  way\r\n\r\nfrom destruction of the sperm cell or egg cell before\r\n\r\nthe  act of fertilization. No one mourns for a  sperm\r\n\r\nkilled  by  a spermatoxic contraceptive cream  or  an\r\n\r\novum  permitted to die twelve hours after  ovulation,\r\n\r\nbecause  the woman from whose ovary it came knew  how\r\n\r\nto  prevent  its  survival by practising  the  rhythm\r\n\r\ntechnique  of birth control. Further, few also  mourn\r\n\r\nthe death of the fertilized ovum when it is prevented\r\n\r\nfrom  implantation  by  the intra-uterine  device  or\r\n\r\ncertain  contraceptive \"pills\"  -  for  such  is  the\r\n\r\naction, it is surmised, by which these contraceptives\r\n\r\nwork.   Sperm   and  egg  are  living  cells   before\r\n\r\nfertilization; otherwise, conception could not occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An early conception is not a human being; it is a\r\n\r\npotential  human  being. The  difference  between  an\r\n\r\nearly  embryo  and a living person  is  immense.  The\r\n\r\nembryo  has  no  consciousness, no  life  experience.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  equating the elimination  of  a  mass  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping  cells with infanticide,  euthanasia,  and\r\n\r\ngenocide  is  offensive and patently fallacious.  The\r\n\r\nfurther  charge that the liberalisation  of  abortion\r\n\r\nlaws will inevitably lead to these practices is a non\r\n\r\nsequitur  and is illogical and wickedly inflammatory.\r\n\r\nHas   liberalisation  of  divorce  laws  led  to  the\r\n\r\nabolition of marriage, if I may ask?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end-point when abortion is no longer\r\n\r\npermissible, as provided by the Bill, is not governed\r\n\r\nby  intangibles like the exact day or week  when  the\r\n\r\nfoetus  is  assumed to receive its soul or  when  its\r\n\r\nmind  is  thought first to function,  but  by  purely\r\n\r\nmedical considerations. Rarely a 27-week foetus lives\r\n\r\nafter  a  natural  birth, and a surviving  foetus  so\r\n\r\nsmall, fragile, and immature has grave likelihood  of\r\n\r\nserious  brain  damage. Therefore, to forestall  this\r\n\r\npossibility  a  full  3-week  leeway  is   given   in\r\n\r\nproducing an aborted foetus. Abortion up to the  24th\r\n\r\nweek,  but  not  beyond, is therefore  allowed  under\r\n\r\nclause  6  of the Bill. From the technical view-point\r\n\r\nof  the  operation, abortion before the 16th week  of\r\n\r\npregnancy  is  simple and virtually danger-free,  and\r\n\r\nbetween  the  16th  and  the 24th  week  it  is  more\r\n\r\ncomplicated and slightly more hazardous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The religious view-point is, of course, respected.\r\n\r\nIt  is  precisely for this reason that  persons  with\r\n\r\nconscientious objections to performing the  operation\r\n\r\nmay  refuse  to  do so. But such persons  might  also\r\n\r\nponder  their responsibility. While they may  have  a\r\n\r\nconscientious objection to perform the operation,  it\r\n\r\ndoes not absolve them from advising on whether or not\r\n\r\nan abortion is necessary as a method of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I have stated just now, to allow\r\n\r\nourselves  to be tied up with the religious arguments\r\n\r\nfor  or against abortion which in any case will never\r\n\r\nresult  in any satisfactory conclusions, even if  the\r\n\r\ndebate  goes on till the cows come home, is  entirely\r\n\r\nfutile. I am sure hon. Members of this House who  are\r\n\r\ncharged  with the welfare of the community will  look\r\n\r\nat  this issue on a realistic and rational basis  and\r\n\r\njudge  what is to the best interest of the community.\r\n\r\nI would like to emphasise here that the Bill does not\r\n\r\nforce  anyone  to have, or to perform,  an  abortion.\r\n\r\nWhile the woman is given a freedom of choice, and the\r\n\r\nindividual  medical practitioner the freedom  to  act\r\n\r\nwithin  his conscience, is it right, may I  ask,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in our multi-racial and multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety  for opponents to the liberalisation  of  the\r\n\r\nlaws on abortion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto impose their moral or religious standards upon the\r\n\r\nentire community?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the United Kingdom experience is an indication -\r\n\r\nwhere  legal  abortions  have increased  several-fold\r\n\r\nsince  the  Abortion Act was passed a  year  ago  -it\r\n\r\nproves that the public have endorsed the Act and  are\r\n\r\nasking that it be implemented more liberally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethical, moral and social reasons form the second\r\n\r\ncategory. Based on religious premises, moral  reasons\r\n\r\nare advocated against abortions and these reasons are\r\n\r\nfurther extended to social issues. The arguments  may\r\n\r\nbe stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Abortion is destruction of life; allowing\r\n\r\nabortions to be done reduces respect for the sanctity\r\n\r\nof  life resulting in a degrading of character  which\r\n\r\nwill  lead  to a lowering of morality, licentiousness\r\n\r\nand increased promiscuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent variation of the argument brought up by a\r\n\r\nmedical  man  is that abortion is the destruction  of\r\n\r\nlife  and  is completely at variance with a  doctor's\r\n\r\nfundamental  ethics.  Allowing  it  will  blunt  this\r\n\r\nsensitivity towards the importance of saving life and\r\n\r\nmay  have  disastrous results, turning  doctors  into\r\n\r\ndangerous persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who predict these dire consequences have very\r\n\r\nflimsy  grounds indeed. Their conclusions must surely\r\n\r\nbe  purely  conjectural.  They  have  indeed  allowed\r\n\r\nthemselves to run away with fantasies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same arguments were raised by the opponents of\r\n\r\nbirth control. It cannot be said that these practices\r\n\r\nhave  resulted  in  licentiousness,  a  break-up   of\r\n\r\nfamilies  and homes. In countries which have  adopted\r\n\r\nvery  liberal  laws on family planning and  abortions\r\n\r\nsuch  as  in  Japan, the East European countries  and\r\n\r\nScandinavia,   these  conclusions   have   not   been\r\n\r\njustified.  There have been no essential  differences\r\n\r\nbetween  human  values  and moral  judgments  between\r\n\r\nthese countries and others which have not liberalized\r\n\r\ntheir  laws. There is the same sense of family  unity\r\n\r\nand  parental  urge  towards their children.  Births,\r\n\r\nmarriages and deaths have been the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who take this line that legalised abortion\r\n\r\nwill  bring about degradation of human life, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that they should themselves just  as\r\n\r\nwell  ponder the fact that by allowing a child to  be\r\n\r\nborn  into  this  world  unwanted  and  uncared  for,\r\n\r\ncondemned to a life of squalor, misery and crime,  is\r\n\r\nthis not just as surely to destroy the person or  his\r\n\r\npersonality and his family? Will this not more surely\r\n\r\nbring about the degradation of human life?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Another moral argument is that abortions should\r\n\r\nnot  be  made  available as persons  should  be  made\r\n\r\nresponsible for their acts. Abortions are an easy way\r\n\r\nout  from  their  responsibility  for  the  care   of\r\n\r\nchildren  and  again will tend towards  moral  decay.\r\n\r\nThis  argument is also quite ludicrous. If a  similar\r\n\r\nline  of argument is accepted, then persons suffering\r\n\r\nfrom,  say,  venereal disease, should not be  treated\r\n\r\nbecause  he should be made to bear the responsibility\r\n\r\nfor his foolishness.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Another small argument which is just as\r\n\r\nfallacious is that legalised abortion will  encourage\r\n\r\npromiscuity.  If  this argument is  valid,  will  not\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  by contraceptive methods  encourage\r\n\r\npromiscuity even more? Common sense will tell us that\r\n\r\nif  a person wants to be promiscuous - and you cannot\r\n\r\nprevent it - the pill which is freely available  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  better  safeguard.  Is  it  not  a  fact  that\r\n\r\npromiscuity  is  a matter that must depend  upon  the\r\n\r\nmoral   fibre   and  character  of   the   particular\r\n\r\nindividual  and  the type of society that  individual\r\n\r\ncomes  from  rather than the availability  of  contra\r\n\r\nceptive measures or legalised abortion?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) And finally, the opponents state that the moral\r\n\r\nprinciple   cannot   he  sacrificed   for   \"economic\r\n\r\nexpediency\"  and that the practice of  abortion  will\r\n\r\nundermine the family planning programme.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This view again is equally fallacious. In all\r\n\r\ncountries  which  have  liberalised  their  laws   on\r\n\r\nabortion,  it  has  been shown that  the  numbers  of\r\n\r\nabortions declined when family planning programmes  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere instituted. This was particularly  seen\r\n\r\nin  Japan.  Often  it  is  forgotten  that  in  Japan\r\n\r\nabortion laws were liberalised before family planning\r\n\r\nwas  generally accepted by the population. After  the\r\n\r\npassage of the Eugenics Law in 1949, amended in 1952,\r\n\r\ngiving   even  greater  liberty,  abortions   rapidly\r\n\r\nincreased  in numbers in Japan. But after 1955,  when\r\n\r\nfamily planning programmes were instituted, abortions\r\n\r\nhave  declined steadily. Another important point with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  experience in Japan which  is  often\r\n\r\noverlooked is that their family planning programme is\r\n\r\nstill backward. The present laws in Japan forbid  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  pill  and the intra-uterine  device  in\r\n\r\nfamily   planning.  This  fact  is  stated   in   the\r\n\r\npublication  entitled  Japan's Experience  in  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  -  Past or Present edited by M.  Muramatsu.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Japanese women have little choice  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily planning methods since the pill and the I.U.D.\r\n\r\nare illegal. As we know from our experience of family\r\n\r\nplanning in Singapore, the majority of the women  who\r\n\r\nhave accepted family planning are on the pill and the\r\n\r\nI.U.D.  Yet  when family planning was  introduced  in\r\n\r\nJapan abortions have declined.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the argument that legalised abortion will\r\n\r\nundermine  family  planning is yet another  piece  of\r\n\r\nfantasy and does not take into account the experience\r\n\r\nof  women  who have had abortions. Few of them  would\r\n\r\nchoose  an  abortion in preference  to  contraceptive\r\n\r\npractice.  In our Singapore society in particular  we\r\n\r\nknow  that there is always the fear of undergoing  an\r\n\r\noperation and our women will certainly not submit  to\r\n\r\nan  operation  unless as a last resort.  Persons  who\r\n\r\nthink  otherwise have probably no knowledge of  these\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may repeat again, the nature of the\r\n\r\nrelationship of our family planning campaign and  the\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill is that family planning is  prevention\r\n\r\nand  legalised abortion is the cure. Perhaps  another\r\n\r\nanalogy from the game of cricket might drive home the\r\n\r\npoint  -family planning is the wicket-keeper  whereas\r\n\r\nlegalised abortion is the long stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category is medical objections. They say\r\n\r\nthat  induced abortion is a surgical procedure which,\r\n\r\nlike  all  surgical procedures, carries a  degree  of\r\n\r\nrisk  to  the  life and health of the woman.  Figures\r\n\r\nquoted should be looked at with great care and with a\r\n\r\ncritical  eye. For one thing, the hazards of abortion\r\n\r\ndiffer, depending on the stage of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early stages - up to about 16 weeks of\r\n\r\npregnancy  - the abortion is induced by scraping  out\r\n\r\nthe  contents  of  the womb. This is a  comparatively\r\n\r\nsimple  operation which in some cases can be done  as\r\n\r\nan  operative procedure in an Outpatient  Department.\r\n\r\nUnder   the  circumstances  the  mortality  rate   is\r\n\r\nexcessively low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evacuation of the uterus at a slightly more\r\n\r\ndeveloped  stage  will require an  operation  on  the\r\n\r\npregnant uterus. Obviously such a procedure carries a\r\n\r\nslightly higher risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting comparison may be made of the number\r\n\r\nof   abortions  done  in  the  countries  which  have\r\n\r\nliberalised   their  abortion  laws   against   their\r\n\r\nmaternal mortality rates. In every country which  has\r\n\r\ndone   so,   although  the  incidence  of   abortions\r\n\r\nincreased  after its laws were enacted, the  maternal\r\n\r\nmortality  rates decreased. This is quite  surprising\r\n\r\nas one would expect that with the increased number of\r\n\r\ninterferences  of  pregnancies,  maternal   mortality\r\n\r\nrates would have increased instead of decreased.  The\r\n\r\nreason is that previously many of the deaths were due\r\n\r\nto   the   women  subjecting  themselves  to  illegal\r\n\r\nabortions  with all the attendant dangers. Perhaps  I\r\n\r\nmay  explain  here  that maternal  mortality  figures\r\n\r\ninclude  deaths to mothers due to deliveries as  well\r\n\r\nas during pregnancy. It might be justifiably surmised\r\n\r\nthat a result of liberalising the laws of abortion is\r\n\r\nthat women will turn to abortions legally done in the\r\n\r\nsafe,  sterile  facilities of hospitals  rather  than\r\n\r\nresort to an illegal abortionist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is clear that more recent figures on\r\n\r\nabortion mortality are coin-parable to, if not better\r\n\r\nthan,  those of maternal mortality. In Singapore,  no\r\n\r\ndeath  from  abortions induced in  the  hospital  was\r\n\r\nrecorded out of 820 and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1,376  cases  in  1967  and  1968  respectively.   In\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakia a similar experience was recorded  for\r\n\r\nthe  same years. In Scandinavia the overall mortality\r\n\r\nrate  for  abortion  is 0.7 to 1,000  which  compares\r\n\r\nfavourably  with maternal mortality  rates  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  In  comparison,  the  maternal  mortality\r\n\r\nrates in Singapore stood at 0.32 per 1,000 in 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another medical objection is that there will be\r\n\r\nrecurrent demands for abortion by the same women.  In\r\n\r\na series of 13 cases studied in Japan, 20 per cent of\r\n\r\nthe   women  on  whom  abortions  were  induced  were\r\n\r\npregnant  again within six months, and  50  per  cent\r\n\r\nwithin  12  or 18 months. From Sweden it is  reported\r\n\r\nthat  38 per cent of the women whose pregnancies were\r\n\r\nterminated had a second unwanted pregnancy within two\r\n\r\nto  four years. In Czechoslovakia it is said that  50\r\n\r\nper  cent of the women on whom abortions are  induced\r\n\r\nare having a second operation and 12 per cent a third\r\n\r\noperation within two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are pertinent arguments. It is for these\r\n\r\nreasons  that  a  Bill on Voluntary Sterilization  is\r\n\r\nbeing introduced concurrently. Where a woman requires\r\n\r\nrepeated abortions, sterilization will be advised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reveal here that the Government has\r\n\r\nalready  decided, even before the Bill was  presented\r\n\r\nto  Parliament,  that  in order to  prevent  repeated\r\n\r\nabortions where a woman who presents herself  for  an\r\n\r\nabortion  has  three children or more,  the  abortion\r\n\r\nwill  be  permitted on condition that she  agrees  to\r\n\r\nsterilization  subsequently.  This  policy  will   be\r\n\r\nadopted  as  standing practice by the Termination  of\r\n\r\nPregnancy Authorisation Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third objection to abortion is the frequent\r\n\r\nundesirable psychic and physical reactions  following\r\n\r\nits  legal performance. I bring this matter up to lay\r\n\r\na  ghost.  Three excellent studies, published  during\r\n\r\n1966,  by  Niswander and Patterson, Pack and  Marcus,\r\n\r\nand Baird all show that \"in women who had a pregnancy\r\n\r\nterminated, psychiatric and neurotic symptoms were no\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommon  than  one  might  expect  in  the  population\r\n\r\ngenerally.\" In his study, Sir Dougald Baird, who is a\r\n\r\ndistinguished  emeritus professor  of  obstetrics  in\r\n\r\nScotland, states: \"In most unmarried women the crisis\r\n\r\nis  resolved  by  termination of pregnancy,  and  the\r\n\r\nbenefit is immediate and very pronounced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these quotations are from learned journals and if Members are interested, they are in front of me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many young married women the effects of termination are equally gratifying and the benefits\r\n\r\nto  the whole marriage situation may be very consider\r\n\r\nable.  In  older married women who do not  want  more\r\n\r\nchildren  and are strained to the breaking  point  by\r\n\r\nthe  occurrence of another pregnancy, the results  of\r\n\r\ntermination    plus   tubal   ligation    are    most\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  There is striking improvement  in  the\r\n\r\nwoman's  physical and mental health and in the  well-being of the whole family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Bill offers a safe alternative to an\r\n\r\nunwanted pregnancy where there is none now; where the\r\n\r\nabortion  is  carried out expeditiously, cheaply  and\r\n\r\nconfidentially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cautionary note has been injected by many\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that abortions should not be made  freely\r\n\r\navailable, that is, that abortion should not be  made\r\n\r\non  demand,  The  reasons for this reservation  range\r\n\r\nfrom  religious,  moral to medical grounds  described\r\n\r\nabove. Whatever the reasons, may I repeat again  that\r\n\r\nit is not the intention of the Bill to make abortions\r\n\r\non demand. To presume so is a misrepresentation or  a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding of the purpose of the  Bill.  If  it\r\n\r\nwas  the  purpose to make abortions on demand,  there\r\n\r\nwould  have  been no necessity to introduce  such  an\r\n\r\nelaborate Bill with its several conditions  and  safe\r\n\r\nguards. All that would have been required would be to\r\n\r\npass  a  short  amending Bill deleting  the  relevant\r\n\r\nsections of the Penal Code referring to illegality of\r\n\r\nabortions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain safeguards have, however, been written into\r\n\r\nthe   Bill   which  would,  amongst   other   things,\r\n\r\neffectively prevent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabortions   being   procurable   on   demand.   These\r\n\r\nsafeguards are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The establishment under clause 3 of the Bill of\r\n\r\nan  Authorisation Board known as the  Termination  of\r\n\r\nPregnancy  Authorisation Board. Every  abortion  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  authorised by the Board  unless  it  is\r\n\r\ncarried out as an emergency under clause 5 (5) or  if\r\n\r\ntwo  medical  practitioners in consultation  deem  it\r\n\r\nnecessary to do so under clause 5 (3) .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will consist of 11 members; six are\r\n\r\nofficials,  and five are appointed by  the  Minister.\r\n\r\nIts  composition is well balanced and representative.\r\n\r\nThe  medical representation would naturally dominate,\r\n\r\nwith the three medical directors from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth;  an  obstetrician and a psychiatrist.  Social\r\n\r\nworkers are represented in the person of the Director\r\n\r\nof  Social  Welfare and a female person who  has  had\r\n\r\nexperience in social welfare work. At least one  more\r\n\r\nfemale member is guaranteed and she will be nominated\r\n\r\nby the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it will be essential that the Board is able to\r\n\r\nfulfil  its  functions  and  to  complete  its   work\r\n\r\nexpeditiously,  provision is  made  for  it  to  form\r\n\r\ncommittees which will be delegated powers to  perform\r\n\r\nany specific function of the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It is also required - under clause 5 (4) - that\r\n\r\nthe  abortion is done in a Government hospital or  in\r\n\r\nan  approved  institution. And under clause  9,  abor\r\n\r\ntions approved by the Board are to be done only by  a\r\n\r\nmedical  practitioner with specialist  qualifications\r\n\r\nor who has the necessary experience. This will ensure\r\n\r\nthat  abortions  are  done under  the  best  possible\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Abortions will not be authorised where the\r\n\r\nduration  of  pregnancy  has gone  beyond  a  certain\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time unless such treatment is immediately\r\n\r\nnecessary to save the life or prevent grave injury to\r\n\r\nthe  physical or mental health of the pregnant woman.\r\n\r\nThis is provided in clause 6. As this time factor  is\r\n\r\nimportant, it is also written into the Bill  in  sub-clause  (6)  of  clause  7 that  the  termination  of\r\n\r\npregnancy  must be carried out within seven  days  of\r\n\r\nits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthorisation. The objective of this provision is  to\r\n\r\nminimise  the  danger  to the  health  of  the  woman\r\n\r\nseeking  abortion  as  it  is  known  that  abortions\r\n\r\ncarried  out  late in pregnancy carries with  them  a\r\n\r\nhigh mortality and morbidity rate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Consent is required of the person to have\r\n\r\nabortion - this is provided in clause 8 - and in case\r\n\r\nof  feeblemindedness or where the woman is unable  to\r\n\r\ngive a valid consent if she is below 18 years of age,\r\n\r\nthe  parent or guardian or, in the absence of  either\r\n\r\none,  the Board, after consultation with the husband,\r\n\r\nmay authorise the abortion. Consent may, however,  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn any time before abortion is carried out.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Secrecy is guaranteed for any application for\r\n\r\ntreatment for termination of pregnancy. Disclosure of\r\n\r\nany  facts or information without the consent of  the\r\n\r\npregnant woman is an offence.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The medical practitioner who has conscientious\r\n\r\nobjection  in  carrying  out abortions  is  protected\r\n\r\nunder clause 10 which provides that he may refuse  to\r\n\r\ndo  so  unless such treatment is to save the life  or\r\n\r\npreserve  the  physical  or  mental  health  of   the\r\n\r\npregnant woman. It should be elaborated further  that\r\n\r\nthe  practitioner  has  a general  duty  towards  his\r\n\r\npatient. Once a doctor/patient relationship has  been\r\n\r\ncreated when the practitioner accepts the patient, he\r\n\r\nmust   provide  advice  as  well  as  treatment  with\r\n\r\nreasonable care and skill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under clause 10 (3) the medical\r\n\r\npractitioner  has  a  duty  to  participate  in  such\r\n\r\ntreatment  in an emergency where no other  doctor  is\r\n\r\navailable and which is necessary to save the life  or\r\n\r\nto prevent grave permanent injury to the physical and\r\n\r\nmental health of a pregnant woman. The Singapore Medical  Association in their memorandum  have  expressed\r\n\r\nstrong  opposition to this sub-clause.  According  to\r\n\r\nthem,   their  Roman  Catholic  members   will   find\r\n\r\nthemselves accountable and this will not, as has been\r\n\r\nenvisaged by clause 10, allow them a way out  without\r\n\r\nbreaking  the  law.  But  I  cannot  really  see  any\r\n\r\njustification to the objection to clause 10 (3) since\r\n\r\nit,  in fact, restates our existing law in which  all\r\n\r\ndoctors have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegal  duty  to preserve life. This legal  duty  must\r\n\r\ncertainly over-ride all religious dogmas and beliefs.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the Roman Catholic dogma that the foetus  has\r\n\r\nthe  right to life as the born child. This assumption\r\n\r\ncan,  if  I  may  point out, lead the Roman  Catholic\r\n\r\ndoctor  into a great moral dilemma, for sometimes  he\r\n\r\nhas  to choose between destroying the foetus in order\r\n\r\nto  save the mother's life and allowing the mother to\r\n\r\ndie  in  the hope of saving the foetus. As  has  been\r\n\r\nwell  said  and I quote: \"The Catholic preference  of\r\n\r\ndoing nothing to assist the mother amounts in fact to\r\n\r\na  preference of the foetus over the mother  and  may\r\n\r\namount to a sentence of death for both.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, a member of the public who\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  a recent public  forum  on  Medical\r\n\r\nEthics organised by the Singapore Medical Association\r\n\r\nhad stated that, by insisting on absolute freedom  to\r\n\r\nrefuse to act against conscience even in an emergency\r\n\r\nto save the life or prevent grave permanent injury to\r\n\r\nthe pregnant woman, the Singapore Medical Association\r\n\r\nseemed  to have overlooked the Declaration of  Geneva\r\n\r\nwhere a doctor is required solemnly to pledge that he\r\n\r\nwould   not   permit  considerations   of   religion,\r\n\r\nnationality,  race, party political  affiliations  or\r\n\r\nsocial standing to intervene between his duty and his\r\n\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sir, if I may be permitted  to\r\n\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The religious beliefs of the Roman Catholic as well\r\n\r\nas those of other religious groups are respected. But\r\n\r\nthe  duty  to  save  life must surely  over-ride  all\r\n\r\nreligious  beliefs or dogmas. It is  therefore  quite\r\n\r\nclear that clause 10 (3) should be retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) To prevent women residing outside Singapore from\r\n\r\ntaking advantage of the liberalisation of the laws on\r\n\r\nabortions, the operations will be available  only  to\r\n\r\nwomen  who  have  been resident in Singapore  for  at\r\n\r\nleast four months prior to the application.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Finally, the law will run for a limited\r\n\r\nduration.  It shall continue in force for four  years\r\n\r\nand  may be extended for a further period of not more\r\n\r\nthan one year. Parliament would, therefore, have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  reviewing  the  experience  and  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of the legislation and the desirability\r\n\r\nof continuing it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the liberalisation of the laws is to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  pregnant woman with an unwanted pregnancy\r\n\r\nto procure a cheap but safe method of abortion. To do\r\n\r\nso,  efficiency  of  procedure and  secrecy  must  be\r\n\r\nmaintained  throughout. To be  effective,  the  whole\r\n\r\nprocess from application, authorisation, or rejection\r\n\r\nmust be done with despatch.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless treatment to terminate a pregnancy is\r\n\r\npermitted under sub-clauses (3) and (5) of  clause  5\r\n\r\nof the Bill, every pregnant woman wishing to have her\r\n\r\npregnancy  terminated shall apply to  the  Board  for\r\n\r\nauthorisation, but, before so doing, shall submit  to\r\n\r\na medical examination. The woman has a free choice as\r\n\r\nto  whichever  registered  medical  practitioner  she\r\n\r\nwants  to  go  to  and no doubt she will  go  to  the\r\n\r\nmedical practitioner in whom she has confidence.  The\r\n\r\nregistered  medical practitioner  who  performs  this\r\n\r\nexamination   will  then  send  to  the   Board   the\r\n\r\napplication form of the pregnant woman with a medical\r\n\r\ncertificate  certifying the  reasons  which,  in  his\r\n\r\nopinion,  justify  treatment to  terminate  pregnancy\r\n\r\ntogether with such other certificates or documents as\r\n\r\nmay  be  prescribed.  The Board  may  also  call  for\r\n\r\nfurther  information or arrange for  further  medical\r\n\r\nexaminations.  If the Board decides to authorise  the\r\n\r\nabortion, it shall advise the applicant the  date  on\r\n\r\nwhich  and place at which treatment is to be  carried\r\n\r\nout  and this date will normally be within seven days\r\n\r\nof the date on which treatment is authorised by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard.  The  Board shall at the same  time  send  all\r\n\r\nrelevant information on the application to the  place\r\n\r\nwhere  treatment is to be carried out for the use  of\r\n\r\nthe registered medical practitioner carrying out such\r\n\r\ntreatment.  Provision is also made, where  the  Board\r\n\r\nrefuses  an  application, for the pregnant  woman  to\r\n\r\nrequest the Board to reconsider its decision  in  the\r\n\r\nlight of further evidence. This is provided in clause 7 (9).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware that by introducing this Bill\r\n\r\nmaking  abortions more permissive, it does  raise  as\r\n\r\nmany  issues  as it attempts to solve. Liberalisation\r\n\r\nof  our abortion laws is not only a legal, medical or\r\n\r\nsociological  problem. It does  touch  on  our  basic\r\n\r\nmoral and religious beliefs - and for this reason  it\r\n\r\nhas  created  an  intense interest as  well  as  some\r\n\r\ncontroversy.  But these are important issues  and  we\r\n\r\nmust  face  them  courageously. The  problem  is  not\r\n\r\nwhether  the foetus is inchoate and hence  expendable\r\n\r\nas  the  law reformers claim, or whether it is  human\r\n\r\nand  inviolable as the opponents insist. The  central\r\n\r\nproblem is that of an unwanted pregnancy and  how  to\r\n\r\ntreat it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is simply the right of an individual to\r\n\r\nhave  a  choice to abort an unwanted pregnancy  under\r\n\r\nspecified  conditions, just as it  is  the  right  of\r\n\r\nevery human being to enjoy a meaningful life, a right\r\n\r\nto  liberty  and  a  right of privacy.  And  for  the\r\n\r\nmedical   practitioner,  the  right  to  perform   an\r\n\r\nabortion  without the threat of criminal proceedings,\r\n\r\nboth being free to follow their conscience and not be\r\n\r\nimposed  by  any ethical code, religious  belief,  or\r\n\r\nmoral  standard  of others. And conversely  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing  in  the Bill to force anyone to perform,  or\r\n\r\nhave, an abortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will now liberate our women, allowing\r\n\r\nthem   to  determine  when  they  should  bear  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  For  the woman, therefore, the  Bill  will\r\n\r\nliberate  her  from the fear of unwanted pregnancies;\r\n\r\nwhere the termination of an unwanted pregnancy can be\r\n\r\nperformed  under the best possible circumstances  and\r\n\r\nin approved hospitals where the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrisks are minimum. As a corollary, it will discourage\r\n\r\nher from resorting to the back-street abortionists.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for society and the state, by ensuring that every\r\n\r\nchild  born  is  a wanted child, it will  assure  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  life of children in Singapore.  It  will\r\n\r\nensure  that the children born in Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\nproperly   cared  for  and  have  opportunities   for\r\n\r\neducation and the full development of their faculties\r\n\r\nso that they can grow up and lead meaningful lives in\r\n\r\nour  society. The lower reproductive rate among those\r\n\r\nwho  can  least afford children will have  beneficial\r\n\r\neffects  in  ensuring  that  the  children  of  these\r\n\r\nmembers of the community would stand a better  chance\r\n\r\nof  having a happy and meaningful life. All these can\r\n\r\nonly  result in greater good to our society and  help\r\n\r\nto improve the quality of our next generation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we in Singapore are now standing on the\r\n\r\ncross-roads  of  history. We  are  facing  the  major\r\n\r\nproblems  of  defence and economic  development  that\r\n\r\nmust be solved if we are to survive as an independent\r\n\r\nnation. But in order to succeed in this, we must also\r\n\r\nsolve  our  social problem which is by no means  less\r\n\r\nimportant  to our continued survival and  prosperity.\r\n\r\nAs  you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a  small\r\n\r\nisland  with no natural resources; but we  have  been\r\n\r\nable  to  survive and prosper so far because  of  the\r\n\r\nhigh quality of performance of our people. Therefore,\r\n\r\nour  continued  survival and well-being  will  depend\r\n\r\nupon  the  quality of our next generation,  which  in\r\n\r\nturn  must  depend on the quality of the children  we\r\n\r\nnow  produce.  As a matter of fact, with  our  advent\r\n\r\ninto  the modern age, the pace and tempo of life will\r\n\r\nbe  much faster and the quality of our people to meet\r\n\r\nthe  future challenges must therefore be of a  higher\r\n\r\ncalibre.  Can  we,  therefore,  particularly  in  our\r\n\r\nSingapore   situation,  afford   to   have   children\r\n\r\nresulting  from unwanted pregnancies from where  most\r\n\r\nof  the  delinquents,  the criminals  and  antisocial\r\n\r\nelements are derived, or allow children with physical\r\n\r\nand mental abnormalities to be born? Will not these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlower  the  quality  of our next generation  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact, reverse the process of nature where the fittest\r\n\r\nsurvive?  The  Bill, therefore, offers a  humane  and\r\n\r\nrational  solution to this important social  question\r\n\r\nfacing us. It will assure the quality of our children\r\n\r\nso that we can continue to survive and prosper.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, appeal to hon. Members to face up to\r\n\r\nthe challenge on this important social issue and give\r\n\r\ntheir  full support to the Bill. I do hope that  they\r\n\r\nwill not falter just because of some pressure, social\r\n\r\nor  otherwise,  brought  to  bear  on  them  by  some\r\n\r\nminority  groups  outside who, on  account  of  their\r\n\r\nreligious dogmas, desire to impose their will on  the\r\n\r\nmajority.  There  have been similar  minority  groups\r\n\r\nbefore who, in their out-of-date beliefs, have  stood\r\n\r\nopposed  to  the  introduction of  birth  control  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  whose stand, as we  know  today,  has\r\n\r\nfound itself in the dustbins of history. In the  same\r\n\r\nway,  I  am certain that the opposing stand  to  this\r\n\r\nBill  taken by this minority group will also  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of time end up in the dustbins of history.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it must be emphasised again that the Bill\r\n\r\ndoes not compel anyone who has any religious scruples\r\n\r\nand   conscience  against  abortion  to  undergo  the\r\n\r\noperation. In fact, the Bill makes it an offence  for\r\n\r\nanyone  who  compels any person to have an  abortion.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has even gone further  in  respecting\r\n\r\nthe religious and ethical beliefs of hon. Members  by\r\n\r\nwithdrawing  the Whip in this debate.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  what I would like to stress again is this:  is\r\n\r\nit  right  in  our  multi-racial and  multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety  for  any  person or  group  of  persons,  on\r\n\r\ngrounds  of  religious dogma, to deny  others,  whose\r\n\r\nreligious and ethical beliefs do not forbid  them  to\r\n\r\nhave  an  abortion,  from  taking  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this proposed law?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, criticisms of the Bill there will be,\r\n\r\nbut  after all that has been said, the case  for the \r\n\r\nBill on every count is indeed overwhelming.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have every confidence in the good sense of\r\n\r\njudgment,  of  fair play and of the high humanitarian\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  our hon. Members who are  always  con\r\n\r\nscious  of  the  public good. I  am  sure  they  will\r\n\r\ncourageously   rise   to  the   occasion   and   give\r\n\r\noverwhelming support to this historic Bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>5.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\nBill  which we are debating today is by far the  most\r\n\r\ncontroversial ever to come before the House. Since it\r\n\r\nwas  first raised in the middle of 1967, the question\r\n\r\nof  liberalised abortion has been discussed at  great\r\n\r\nlength by civic, professional and religious bodies in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  has  been  the  subject   of   three\r\n\r\nextraordinary  general  meetings  of  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nMedical  Association;  it has  been  the  subject  of\r\n\r\nforums  in  the  University  of  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic; it has been much talked about  over  the\r\n\r\nradio  and on TV; it has been the subject of articles\r\n\r\nand letters in the press. From all the discussions no\r\n\r\nconsensus of opinion has emerged. Or perhaps it would\r\n\r\nbe  more  accurate to say that a consensus  has  been\r\n\r\nreached  on  only two points: first,  no  responsible\r\n\r\nbody  in  Singapore  would  approve  of  abortion  on\r\n\r\ndemand,  and, secondly, scarcely anybody is satisfied\r\n\r\nwith the present Bill as it stands.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my contention that the Abortion Bill now\r\n\r\nbefore the House is ill-conceived and ill-timed,  and\r\n\r\nthat it should be withdrawn from the programme of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This  Bill does  not  serve  any  useful\r\n\r\npurpose at all and will not answer any need expressed\r\n\r\nby  the  people.  When the then Minister  for  Health\r\n\r\nannounced  that  the  Government  was  proposing   to\r\n\r\nintroduce a Bill to liberalise abortion, was this  in\r\n\r\nresponse  to any public clamour for a change  in  the\r\n\r\nexisting  law?  It  was  not.  His  announcement  was\r\n\r\nreceived with dismay by many, with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurprise by all. This Bill was not something that the\r\n\r\npeople  wanted, lt was something that the  Government\r\n\r\nthought  up  for  the  good  of  the  state;  it  was\r\n\r\nsomething  on  which, in my opinion, the Government's\r\n\r\nthinking went seriously wrong.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the people have shown no enthusiasm for the\r\n\r\nGovernment's proposal to grant them easier facilities\r\n\r\nfor  abortion, in spite of all the comments made, and\r\n\r\nbecause the people are convinced that abortion  is  a\r\n\r\nbad  thing. They are not easily deceived by those who\r\n\r\ntell them that liberalised abortion is an enlightened\r\n\r\npolicy.   They  are  not  confused  by  philosophical\r\n\r\narguments  as to when exactly human life is  present.\r\n\r\nThey  know that abortion means killing a life  which,\r\n\r\nif  left  alone, would very soon be a baby boy  or  a\r\n\r\nbaby  girl.  And they are quite sure that  the  fewer\r\n\r\nabortions there are the better.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if this Bill before the House today is passed,\r\n\r\nthe  one  certain  result  is  that  the  number   of\r\n\r\nabortions performed in Singapore is going to increase\r\n\r\nenormously.  It  has happened everywhere  else  where\r\n\r\nthey  have changed the law and I am positive it  will\r\n\r\nhappen here also. People know this, and are far  from\r\n\r\nenthusiastic  about it. Of one thing I am  absolutely\r\n\r\nconvinced,  namely, that any change in  the  existing\r\n\r\nlaw will bring more harm than good to the Republic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to change the law. The only grounds\r\n\r\non  which any self-respecting doctor would wish to be\r\n\r\nallowed to perform an abortion would be on very  rare\r\n\r\nmedical  grounds,  when the life  or  health  of  the\r\n\r\nmother  is at stake. This is already provided for  in\r\n\r\nour present law. By statute, the doctor is not liable\r\n\r\nto prosecution if he operates to save the life of the\r\n\r\nmother.  By interpretation, he will not be prosecuted\r\n\r\nif he operates to prevent the mother from becoming \"a\r\n\r\nphysical  or mental wreck\". The doctor who,  in  good\r\n\r\nfaith,  operates  for this purpose, provided  he  has\r\n\r\nfollowed the accepted medical practice in therapeutic\r\n\r\nabortion, will have nothing to fear from the existing\r\n\r\nlaw as actually applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some doctors would like to see this interpretation\r\n\r\nwritten  into the statute. But I think this would  be\r\n\r\nunwise.  This statute embodies one of the fundamental\r\n\r\nvalues of our society - respect for human life,  even\r\n\r\nthe life of the unborn child - and any tampering with\r\n\r\nthis  statute will give the impression  that  we  are\r\n\r\nchanging our sense of human values. Moreover, if  the\r\n\r\npresent  stricter  wording of the law  makes  doctors\r\n\r\ncautious in the matter of performing abortions,  this\r\n\r\nis  as  it  should be; an abortion is  a  destructive\r\n\r\nprocedure  which should never be contemplated  except\r\n\r\nwith extreme caution.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other clauses in the Bill under which\r\n\r\nabortions  would be allowed, they are  completely  un\r\n\r\nacceptable.   Either  they  are  reducible   to   the\r\n\r\npreservation of the life or health of the mother - in\r\n\r\nwhich  case  they are unnecessary - or  they  are  a\r\n\r\ntotally  unwarranted extension of the  one  plausible\r\n\r\nreason for even considering permitting an abortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody arguing in favour of changing our present law\r\n\r\nhas brought forward any convincing reason for change.\r\n\r\nMany reasons indeed have been advanced. None of them,\r\n\r\nin  my  opinion, will stand up to critical  analysis.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we have been told that our ideal should\r\n\r\nbe:\r\n\r\n\"Every  child a wanted child.\" Now, may I ask, either\r\n\r\nthis is meant seriously -  in which case it is  an\r\n\r\nargument  for abortion on demand - or it is  not  - in\r\n\r\nwhich   case   it  is  an  example  of  irresponsible\r\n\r\nsloganeering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every child a wanted child\" - what is this supposed\r\n\r\nto  mean?  That  every woman who finds  herself  unexpectedly pregnant has a legal right to have the  baby\r\n\r\nremoved? This is abortion on demand. Is this what  is\r\n\r\nwanted?  If  it is, then why not say so,  instead  of\r\n\r\nmaking us all study a long and complicated Bill  with\r\n\r\nprovisions   for   \"Boards\"  and   \"committees\"   and\r\n\r\n\"approved institutions\" and the rest? But the Bill is\r\n\r\nnot  what is intended, so let us stop pretending that\r\n\r\na  liberalised Abortion Bill will ensure  that  every\r\n\r\nchild is a wanted child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every child a wanted child\" -often enough we have\r\n\r\nto  deplore  the circumstances in which  a  pregnancy\r\n\r\noccurs, but once the child has been conceived we have\r\n\r\nan  obligation to protect it. We cannot be  deflected\r\n\r\nfrom  this  duty because the intercourse  might  have\r\n\r\nbeen  illegal (because of rape or incest); or because\r\n\r\nthe  woman  might  be  unmarried,  or  separated,  or\r\n\r\ndivorced;  or  because her environment might  not  be\r\n\r\nsuitable  (whatever that might mean); or because  the\r\n\r\nbaby   might   be   born   handicapped.   All   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances  might be deplorable, but  not  to  the\r\n\r\nextent of justifying the killing of the unborn child.\r\n\r\nTo  say  otherwise  would  be  to  legislate  out  of\r\n\r\nsentimentalism.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We speak of the right of the child to be a wanted\r\n\r\nchild  - and then we deprive it of the right to live.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of crazy logic is this?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every child a wanted child\" - this should indeed be\r\n\r\nour  ideal;  but  not  by increasing  the  number  of\r\n\r\nabortions.  Who can really judge whether or  not  the\r\n\r\nchild   is  wanted  until  it  is  born?  There   are\r\n\r\ninnumerable  cases reported of women who,  when  they\r\n\r\nfirst  became pregnant, asked for an abortion  -  but\r\n\r\nwere  persuaded  to have the baby, and  once  it  was\r\n\r\nborn,  were  very grateful that the  doctor  had  not\r\n\r\ngiven  in  to  their request. In any  case,  a  child\r\n\r\nunwanted by its parents may well become a treasure to\r\n\r\nsome  childless couple. I quote from a paper by Prof.\r\n\r\nTow  Siang Hwa, Why I disapprove of legalised  socio-economic abortion:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The \"unwanted child\" - if there is such a term -\r\n\r\nshould surely be entrusted to the care of an adoption\r\n\r\nsociety rather than to the abortionist.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer to change this slogan to: \"Every\r\n\r\nchild  a  protected child.\" Here is an aim  which  is\r\n\r\nworthy  of  a truly liberal and enlightened  society.\r\n\r\nThe  cornerstone of a truly enlightened society  lies\r\n\r\nin  its  protection of the right to life. In  such  a\r\n\r\nsociety  the  function  of the  law  is  seen  to  be\r\n\r\nprimarily  to  protect the rights of individuals,  of\r\n\r\nwhich the most fundamental is the right to life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  protection which the law affords to  individuals\r\n\r\nextends to the unborn child in its mother's womb.  In\r\n\r\nour society the assumption underlying the law is that\r\n\r\nthe  value  of  a human life, even the  life  of  the\r\n\r\nunborn child, is so great that its destruction  could\r\n\r\nnever   be   justified  on  the   grounds   of   mere\r\n\r\nconvenience, either to an individual or to the state.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is wish to change all this; there is wish\r\n\r\nto change a basic principle of our society and of our\r\n\r\nlaw;  there is wish to measure the right to  life  of\r\n\r\nthe  unborn  child  according to  the  socio-economic\r\n\r\ncircumstances of its mother. On what grounds does the\r\n\r\nGovernment  seek to reverse a long-held tradition  of\r\n\r\nour  society  about the right to life of  the  unborn\r\n\r\nchild?  Is it on the grounds that this foetus is  not\r\n\r\nhuman, and therefore does not enjoy the right to life\r\n\r\nwhich is embodied in our law? If this is the view  of\r\n\r\nthose who wish to liberalise our abortion laws,  then\r\n\r\nit  is  up  to  them to prove it, for the  weight  of\r\n\r\nevidence  lies heavily against them. From innumerable\r\n\r\ntestimonies available I shall choose only three:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. From the International Code of Medical Ethics\r\n\r\npublished by the World Medical Association: 'A doctor\r\n\r\nmust always bear in mind the importance of preserving\r\n\r\nhuman  life from the time of conception until death.'\r\n\r\n[Ref. INTERCHANGE - Vol. 1, No. 4 of 1968, page 206].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. From the International Conference on Abortion\r\n\r\nheld  in Harvard in 1967: 'From the present available\r\n\r\ndata, we can only conclude that human life begins  at\r\n\r\nconception, or no later than 'blastcyst' (i.e, eight\r\n\r\ndays  after  conception). The foetus,  therefore,  at\r\n\r\nleast  from  blastcyst,  deserves  respect  as  human\r\n\r\nfoetal  life.' [Ref. INTERCHANGE - Vol. 1, No.  4  of\r\n\r\n1968, page 206].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. From Professor Scott, Professor of Obstetrics and\r\n\r\nGynaecology  at Leeds University, who, after  lengthy\r\n\r\nresearch  into  this question, concluded:  'The  most\r\n\r\nimportant fact that gynaecologists know, and the  one\r\n\r\nmost understandably\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuppressed,  is  that performing an abortion  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  they are usually called upon to do so  involves\r\n\r\ndestruction  of a clearly recognisable human  being.'\r\n\r\n[Ref. INTERCHANGE - Vol. 1, No. 4 of 1968, page 205].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of these citations from experts - and they\r\n\r\ncould be multiplied indefinitely - is to show that it\r\n\r\nis  a  solidly founded tradition that foetal life  is\r\n\r\nsomehow  human. Because this brings us to the central\r\n\r\nissue at stake in this debate. That central issue  is\r\n\r\nthis:   our  present  law  on  abortion  embodies   a\r\n\r\ntraditional  social  belief about  the  humanness  of\r\n\r\nfoetal   life,   a  belief  strongly   supported   by\r\n\r\nscientific  opinion. Any decision by  this  House  to\r\n\r\nchange  that  law  involves  society  in  a  decision\r\n\r\naffecting life and death, not merely for the  foetus,\r\n\r\nbut ultimately for the whole of society. For what  is\r\n\r\nat issue is the right to life. Once the law sanctions\r\n\r\nthe  invasion of that fundamental right, may  I  ask,\r\n\r\nwhere then does it draw the line?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or will it be said that because the foetus is not\r\n\r\nyet  fully  developed,  therefore  it  possesses   no\r\n\r\nrights?  This is a dangerous principle  on  which  to\r\n\r\nrely.  Once  we start putting the convenience  of  an\r\n\r\nindividual or of the state before respect for a human\r\n\r\nlife  that is not yet fully developed, then  we  have\r\n\r\nset  our  feet  on the slippery path indeed.  If  one\r\n\r\nconsiders  oneself  justified  in  destroying  foetal\r\n\r\nhuman  life for the well-being of the mother, or  the\r\n\r\nfamily, or the state, then there is every danger that\r\n\r\none  will  not be satisfied to stop there. I  am  not\r\n\r\nthinking  of  this  Government.  I  am  thinking   of\r\n\r\nwhatever  government might be sitting here 10  or  20\r\n\r\nyears  from  now.  If  we  here  today  abandon   the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that human life, even foetal  human  life,\r\n\r\nmust be respected, then we have opened the way for  a\r\n\r\nfuture government to argue that it is justifiable  to\r\n\r\nlegislate for the destruction of deformed babies,  of\r\n\r\nthe  mentally defective, of the incurably ill, of the\r\n\r\nold  and the sick and the economically worthless.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, once we allow the destruction of foetal\r\n\r\nhuman  life  on the grounds that it is not completely\r\n\r\nhuman, then we leave the door open to others to argue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout what constitutes a \"complete human\". Compulsory\r\n\r\neuthanasia is not unthinkable in a society  that  has\r\n\r\naccepted voluntary abortion. Once one starts to value\r\n\r\nhuman   beings  according  to  their  worth  to   the\r\n\r\ncommunity, then one soon begins to notice quite a few\r\n\r\nwithout  whom  the  community  -  the  rest  of   the\r\n\r\ncommunity, that is, - might be considered better off.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sort of thing of which people are always\r\n\r\naccusing  politicians  - sacrificing  principles  for\r\n\r\nexpediency. And all for what? What problems does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  attempt  to solve by  these  drastic  and\r\n\r\ndangerous  measures?  What  good  will  come  to  the\r\n\r\nRepublic   of  Singapore  by  pushing  through   this\r\n\r\ncontroversial Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to find the answer to this obvious\r\n\r\nquestion,  for  those  who  favour  liberalising  our\r\n\r\nabortion laws keep chopping and changing the  reasons\r\n\r\nthey put forward to justify this move. They tell  you\r\n\r\nhorror  stories about women suffering  disability  or\r\n\r\ndeath  at the hands of illegal abortionists. When  it\r\n\r\nis  proved to them that legalising abortion does  not\r\n\r\nlead  to  any  decrease  in  the  number  of  illegal\r\n\r\nabortions, they change their ground and say  that  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary to control the population growth.  When\r\n\r\nit  is pointed out that our rate of increase is  well\r\n\r\non  the  way to being controlled by less drastic  mea\r\n\r\nsures, they change again and say that no woman should\r\n\r\nbe  obliged to bear a child which she never wanted to\r\n\r\nhave.  When it is again pointed out that  it  may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary to take into consideration the right of the\r\n\r\nchild to be born, they resort to abuse and claim that\r\n\r\none is talking idealistic nonsense.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us try to look dispassionately at these\r\n\r\nalleged  reasons for changing our law. First of  all,\r\n\r\nto  get  rid  of  the  criminal  abortionist.  It  is\r\n\r\ncommonly  assumed  that it is necessary  to  legalise\r\n\r\nabortion  if we are to reduce the number of  criminal\r\n\r\nabortions.  May  I point out in passing  that  in  no\r\n\r\nother  criminal  activity has it been suggested  that\r\n\r\nordinary  citizens,  much  less  the  members  of   a\r\n\r\ndignified  profession,  should  take  over  from  the\r\n\r\ncriminals because they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  the  job  so  much better. Again, what  does  the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  other countries teach  us  about  the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between liberalising the abortion  laws\r\n\r\nand   reducing  the  number  of  illegal   abortions?\r\n\r\nProfessor   Ingelman-Sundberg  from   Stockholm   has\r\n\r\nreported  that  25  years of  legalised  abortion  in\r\n\r\nSweden have not made the slightest difference in  the\r\n\r\ncriminal  abortion rate. He found the  experience  of\r\n\r\nHungary  and Czechoslovakia was similar.  The  reason\r\n\r\nfor this strange fact is given in the Report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the legalising of abortion alters the climate of\r\n\r\nopinion among the public and even the Courts of  law.\r\n\r\nThe  result  is that criminal abortion  becomes  less\r\n\r\nabhorrent. The public becomes abortion-minded.' [Ref.\r\n\r\n5th  World  Congress of Gynaecology and Obstetrics  -\r\n\r\nSydney, pages 784 to 787].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in September 1967, speakers at the 5th World\r\n\r\nCongress  of  Gynaecology and  Obstetrics  in  Sydney\r\n\r\ntestified  to  the  same  effect.  Two  doctors  from\r\n\r\nSwitzerland stated:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Contrary to many people's expectations the\r\n\r\nlegalisation of therapeutic abortion has not led to a\r\n\r\nreduction  in  the incidence of illegal abortions  in\r\n\r\nthe countries concerned.' [Ref, ibid, page 764].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe similar conclusions have been reached\r\n\r\nabout the experience of Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these cases the result of liberalising the\r\n\r\nabortion laws has simply been that the overall number\r\n\r\nof abortions shoots up, but there is no evidence that\r\n\r\nthe  number  of illegal abortions shows any  sign  of\r\n\r\ndecreasing. The reason is obvious: as long as the law\r\n\r\ndemands  that certain conditions be fulfilled  before\r\n\r\nan abortion can be performed, then those women who do\r\n\r\nnot come under those conditions will continue to seek\r\n\r\nout the illegal operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Is the Member for Punggol saying\r\n\r\nthat abortions should be freely available?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In fact, there is good reason to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the effect of liberalising the abortion\r\n\r\nlaws  is to increase the number of illegal abortions,\r\n\r\nsince women become more abortion-minded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the only hope of getting rid of the\r\n\r\nillegal  abortionist  is  to  make  abortion   freely\r\n\r\navailable on demand; to induce women to believe  that\r\n\r\nhaving an abortion is as respectable as having a hair-cut.  Is this the attitude we wish to encourage among\r\n\r\nour women?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the argument that a liberalised abortion\r\n\r\npolicy  is necessary foi population control, I  would\r\n\r\nsay this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  abortion is resorted to as a means of  population\r\n\r\ncontrol  when  other  family  planning  methods  have\r\n\r\nfailed,  then it will either be something rare  -  in\r\n\r\nwhich case it will make no appreciable difference  to\r\n\r\nthe overall population -or it will be widespread,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  case it is a very bad means of birth  control.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  bad means because it is dangerous for  the\r\n\r\nhealth  of  the  women, because it  only  solves  the\r\n\r\nproblem temporarily, and because it will put a severe\r\n\r\nstrain on the medical services.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not go into details concerning the medical\r\n\r\ndangers of abortion but shall content myself with one\r\n\r\nquotation.   This  is  a  statement  by  Dr   Hector\r\n\r\nMacLennan,   President  of  the  Royal   College   of\r\n\r\nObstetricians and Gynaecologists in Britain, made  in\r\n\r\nthe Times of 21st January, 1966:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Even if the operation is to be limited to hospital\r\n\r\npractice  by  recognised  specialists  it  should  be\r\n\r\nstated  most  emphatically that therapeutic  abortion\r\n\r\neven  in  skilled  hands is more dangerous  than  the\r\n\r\npublic and many doctors appreciate.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, with a falling birthrate like that of\r\n\r\nSingapore  - I have just received the Report  of  the\r\n\r\nPopulation Board - it is absurd to say that  abortion\r\n\r\nis  a  necessary adjunct to other methods  of  family\r\n\r\nplanning  as a means of population control.  This  is\r\n\r\nwhy   so  many  overseas  visitors  to  international\r\n\r\nconferences  here  have expressed  amazement  at  the\r\n\r\nproposal  of  the Government to introduce liberalised\r\n\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the socio-economic argument: that a\r\n\r\nwoman  should  not be obliged to carry  on  with  her\r\n\r\npregnancy   if  her  environment  would  justify   an\r\n\r\nabortion.  I have already spoken about the importance\r\n\r\nour law should attach to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  protection of human life, even the life  of  the\r\n\r\nunborn child, if competent medical authorities are of\r\n\r\nthe  opinion that the preservation of the life of the\r\n\r\nmother  entails  killing the foetus, then  the  state\r\n\r\ndoes  not  abdicate its responsibilities  to  protect\r\n\r\nhuman life if it exonerates the woman and her doctors\r\n\r\nfrom prosecution. But where the position involves not\r\n\r\nonly  one  life  against another  but  socio-economic\r\n\r\nconvenience against the right to life, then any truly\r\n\r\nprogressive  and  enlightened law must  be  one  that\r\n\r\nprotects  this human life. Abortion on socio-economic\r\n\r\ngrounds  is  not a liberalisation of the law,  but  a\r\n\r\nleap into lawlessness.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we perhaps to change our abortion law just\r\n\r\nbecause  some  other countries have  changed  theirs?\r\n\r\nBefore  we decide to jump into the same boat, let  us\r\n\r\nreflect on the fact that some of those countries  are\r\n\r\nhaving  second  thoughts about the  wisdom  of  their\r\n\r\ndecision. London is not proud of her new title as the\r\n\r\n\"abortion-centre of Europe\". Japan has for many years\r\n\r\nbeen  worried  about  the  continuing  high  rate  of\r\n\r\nabortions, in  a Japanese paper entitled  The  East,\r\n\r\nVol.  IV,  No.  6, November-December 1968, a  report\r\n\r\nentitled A report of Induced Abortion, it was  stated\r\n\r\nthat  according to the investigation carried  out  by\r\n\r\nthe  Institute of Population Problems of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health and Welfare, the amendment to the  Eugenic\r\n\r\nProtection  Law which allowed abortion on grounds  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  hardship resulted in a sudden increase  in\r\n\r\nthe number of abortions. Between 1953 and 1961, there\r\n\r\nwas  art  annual  average of one  million  abortions.\r\n\r\nAlthough  1962  showed some decrease, cases  in  1965\r\n\r\nnumbered   840.000.  These  were   only   the   cases\r\n\r\nofficially reported.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, an article in the Straits Times of\r\n\r\n20th  November,  1967,  page  9,  entitled  \"Abortion\r\n\r\nAlarm. Communists take to the Pill\", states that  the\r\n\r\ngovernments  of  several Eastern  European  countries\r\n\r\nhave   become   alarmed  at  the  increasing   number\r\n\r\nundergoing  legal  abortions. The  reason  for  their\r\n\r\nalarm is that the health of young women, both\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarried  and  unmarried, is being affected  by  these\r\n\r\nnumerous abortions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in spite of all these warnings, are we still\r\n\r\neager  to  rush  into a liberalised  abortion  policy\r\n\r\nwithout   even  pausing  to  estimate  the   probable\r\n\r\neffects? Let us be clear about one point: to  imagine\r\n\r\nthat we can safely pass this Bill since it can always\r\n\r\nbe repealed in four years' time is to be blind to the\r\n\r\nrealities  of life. An enlightened society like  ours\r\n\r\ncannot liberalise its abortion policy and then,  when\r\n\r\nthe evil consequences become apparent, hope to change\r\n\r\nthe  permissive  attitude that  its  own  policy  has\r\n\r\nengendered. This is quite unrealistic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the Republic of Singapore, we are\r\n\r\ntrying  to build a nation. We are striving to  instil\r\n\r\ninto  our  people a spirit of dedication, a sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  an  attitude  of  social-mindedness,\r\n\r\nloyalty,  patriotism  and the rest.  We  are  niaking\r\n\r\nstrenuous efforts to encourage people to think beyond\r\n\r\ntheir  own selfish interests, to look to the  welfare\r\n\r\nof  their  fellows. We are aiming to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\ncharacter of our people by proposing high ideals,  by\r\n\r\ncalling for self-discipline. And now we are in danger\r\n\r\nof  undoing all this by introducing a Bill to make it\r\n\r\neasier  for women to obtain abortions, We  have  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  inspire  our  people  to  face   up   to\r\n\r\nchallenges. Now, when we are faced with a  challenge,\r\n\r\nwe take the easy way out by legalising abortion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried to teach our people responsibility.\r\n\r\nNow we encourage irresponsibility.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always been trying to build a hard society.\r\n\r\nNow we are preparing the way for a soft society.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be said that this Bill does not oblige\r\n\r\nanybody  to have an abortion if she does not wish  to\r\n\r\ndo so. But we must remember that the law itself has a\r\n\r\ncertain  educational  value,  It  is  one  thing   to\r\n\r\nintroduce a new law constituting abortion a crime; it\r\n\r\nis  a  different thing to repeal or amend a law which\r\n\r\nhas  been on the statute books a long time and  still\r\n\r\nholds  good. In this case the impression is given  to\r\n\r\npeople that if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabortion is no longer as illegal as before, that must\r\n\r\nbe because it is no longer as bad as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore want to be looked up to as a beacon\r\n\r\nin  Southeast Asia - not just for our economic drive,\r\n\r\nnot  just  for our skills and dynamism, but also  for\r\n\r\nour  sense  of  justice, for  our  defence  of  human\r\n\r\nrights,  for  our protection of the weak.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nnobody  is in more need of that protection  than  the\r\n\r\nunborn child in its mother's womb.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore is to survive and prosper, it will be\r\n\r\nbecause of the physical and moral sturdiness  of  its\r\n\r\npeople,  because of the personal moral discipline  it\r\n\r\nis  prepared  to  face challenges  with  courage  and\r\n\r\ndetermination.  Encouraging easier abortions  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  way to foster such an attitude. On the contrary,\r\n\r\nit  is the way to foster a selfish society; one which\r\n\r\nputs  personal convenience before a sense of duty  to\r\n\r\nothers;  one which refuses to face challenges because\r\n\r\nthat  requires effort; one which ends up as  a  soft,\r\n\r\ncomfort-seeking  society - people  looking  for  more\r\n\r\nmoney  for  less work, people more eager  to  receive\r\n\r\nthan to give, and people looking for the easy way out\r\n\r\nrather than striving hard to achieve.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Singapore needs is not an Abortion Bill, but an\r\n\r\nincreased   emphasis   on  self-respect,   on   self-discipline,  on  common human  decency.  We  need  to\r\n\r\nensure   that  our  young  people  receive  a  better\r\n\r\npreparation    all-round   for   marriage,    towards\r\n\r\nresponsible parenthood and the rest. This  should  be\r\n\r\nand must be our main objective if we are to develop a\r\n\r\nhard  society. We need to make more strenuous efforts\r\n\r\nto bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to believe that\r\n\r\nParliament,  being the responsible  legislating  body\r\n\r\nand  being  responsible for the foreseeable consequences, of  its acts, would not turn a deaf ear  to  my\r\n\r\narguments against the passing of this Bill, because I\r\n\r\nam  fully  convinced that its consequences  would  be\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the future growth, health and  welfare\r\n\r\nof our young Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore - Instant Asia\". It is a very nice\r\n\r\ncaption and well projected. I fear that if this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  passed,  another name \"Paradise of  Abortionists\"\r\n\r\nmay  be  added to it. Surely this is not the sort  of\r\n\r\nreputation  we want to get.

Let us admit that this Bill was a\r\n\r\nmistake  and  that this Abortion Bill  is  one  whose\r\n\r\npurpose is obscure, whose need is unproven and  whose\r\n\r\nconsequences would be deplorable.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I urge hon.

It\r\n\r\nis  to  be  expected, therefore,  that  the  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  this problem will not be uniform  among  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The reason is quite simple. There  are  some\r\n\r\npeople  who  persist in following certain  moral  and\r\n\r\nreligious concepts and, as a result, lack the courage\r\n\r\nto  adopt  positive measures in the face  of  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant problem. Attitudes of this sort are  likely\r\n\r\nto  obstruct the efforts of the Government to  change\r\n\r\nour society.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the Abortion Bill is designed in accordance with the needs of our people and the requirements of our society. I personally have gone through very carefully the clauses of this Bill and I have the following reasons to advance in full support for the liberalisation of the law on abortion. My\r\n\r\nview-point is a completely independent one and  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  influenced  by  any medical ideas  or  religious\r\n\r\nconcepts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all realise that our country is in a peculiar\r\n\r\nsituation  and  we should not be satisfied  with  our\r\n\r\npresent  situation.  We should  plan  ahead  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour country does not have enough natural resources to\r\n\r\naccommodate  the  increase  of  our  population.   At\r\n\r\npresent, our population growth rate is 2.5 per  cent,\r\n\r\na  figure  slightly higher than that in some  Western\r\n\r\ncountries. At the same time, we also have some 50,000\r\n\r\npeople  who are unemployed, and on top of  all  this,\r\n\r\nthe British forces are going to withdraw, it is to be\r\n\r\nexpected, therefore, that the problem of unemployment\r\n\r\nwill  become  more and more serious. As a responsible\r\n\r\nGovernment  we must pay attention to these  problems.\r\n\r\nWe  should  plan  ahead and find  fair  and  rational\r\n\r\nsolutions  to  these  problems. I  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the law of abortion will reduce the\r\n\r\npopulation growth rate and this will be beneficial to\r\n\r\nour economy.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Abortion Bill will ensure that\r\n\r\nchildren born in the Republic will be of a very  good\r\n\r\nquality. They will be able to obtain proper care  and\r\n\r\nhave a fair chance of a good education. Thirdly,  the\r\n\r\nAbortion  Bill will provide a last resort  for  women\r\n\r\nwhen     contraceptive    measures    have    failed.\r\n\r\nLiberalisation  of  the law  on  abortion  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsubstitute  for  family  planning,  it  is   only   a\r\n\r\nsupplementary method, especially for those women  who\r\n\r\ndo  not  wish  to  have any more children.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, it is a very safe last resort.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, bearing in mind the national interests and the requirements of our environment, the future of our children, family welfare and the safety and personal welfare of our women, I fully support this Abortion Bill in principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the hon. Member sitting beside  me  has\r\n\r\nstood  up to oppose vehemently the Abortion Bill.  In\r\n\r\nrising to speak on the Bill, I have a different view-point  from his. His arguments are based on religious\r\n\r\nconsiderations, but my opposition to the Bill  arises\r\n\r\nfrom humanitarian considerations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that Singapore is a tiny island\r\n\r\nwith  no  natural resources. The land area is limited\r\n\r\nand there is\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  very  little valuable land. But our  population\r\n\r\nhas reached two million with a population density  of\r\n\r\n8,000  people  to  a  square  mile.  This  population\r\n\r\ndensity has given cause for worry, and if this is  to\r\n\r\ncontinue,  we  may  one day reach a  situation  where\r\n\r\nthere  will be a population explosion. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  our country is only at the beginning of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding  and there are many tasks which require  our\r\n\r\nattention. Our rate of economic growth is  still  far\r\n\r\nbehind  our  rate of population growth, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the  former  Minister  for  Health,  now   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Communications,  during  his  term  of\r\n\r\noffice  tried  his very best to promote family  plann\r\n\r\ning.  As  a result, our rate of population growth  is\r\n\r\ndecreasing.  According  to a report  by  the  Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau  Maternity Hospital, it is stated  that  in\r\n\r\n1965,  40,181 babies were born in Singapore,  on  the\r\n\r\naverage of about 110 babies a day. Whereas after  the\r\n\r\nnation-wide  campaign of family planning,  the  birth\r\n\r\nrate in Singapore decreased to 38,252 in 1967.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  prided  itself  on  its   pragmatic\r\n\r\nsocialism  and,  in  accordance with  its  socialist\r\n\r\nprinciples,  has introduced and implemented  various\r\n\r\nsocial  projects and schemes for the benefit of  its\r\n\r\ncitizens. Not the least praiseworthy effort  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been that in the field\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof education. We are one of the few countries in Asia\r\n\r\nto provide free primary education for the children of\r\n\r\nour  citizens in the language media of their own free\r\n\r\nchoice.  It is not surprising that today in Singapore\r\n\r\nilliteracy has ceased to be a problem.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, to give it due credit, has\r\n\r\nnot  contented  itself  with  merely  providing  free\r\n\r\nprimary  education  but  has made  plans  to  provide\r\n\r\nsimilarly  free secondary education for our citizens.\r\n\r\nIt  is unfortunate that the scheme for free secondary\r\n\r\neducation  could  not  be  implemented  for   various\r\n\r\nreasons   of   national  exigencies.  The  indonesian\r\n\r\nconfrontation,   followed  by  our  separation   from\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  the  accelerated  withdrawal  of   the\r\n\r\nBritish Armed Forces, has in no small way contributed\r\n\r\nto  making this scheme economically unfeasible. It is\r\n\r\ninevitable  that our scarce financial resources  have\r\n\r\nto  be  channelled away from social projects to cater\r\n\r\nfor  more  vital needs, namely, our industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme and defence responsibilities. The  generous\r\n\r\nresponse  to  the  National  Defence  Fund  from  all\r\n\r\nsections  of  our  citizens, however,  is  sufficient\r\n\r\nindication of the realisation and the appreciation by\r\n\r\nour   citizens  of  the  magnitude  of  our  national\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while our citizens understand the problems of\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  I  am sad to  say  that  a  similar\r\n\r\ncompliment  cannot  be  paid to  the  authorities  in\r\n\r\ncharge of administering our educational policy. But I\r\n\r\nmust  also  hasten  to  add  that  our  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation  has done well to fashion its  policies  to\r\n\r\nmeet   the   changing   economic   circumstances   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The recent emphasis on technical education\r\n\r\nis  in  keeping  with the transition  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy   from   entrepot  trade   to   manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries. The channelling of students at the end of\r\n\r\ntheir second year of secondary education into various\r\n\r\neducational   streams,  in  accordance   with   their\r\n\r\nrespective  aptitudes or skills  as  determined  from\r\n\r\ntheir academic records, is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  consonance with the rational development of our\r\n\r\nnational  resources. The Ministry, however, does  not\r\n\r\nappear to give any thought to the minimisation of the\r\n\r\neconomic  effect of the readjustment of its  policies\r\n\r\non the parents of the students concerned. To my mind,\r\n\r\nit  is a singular failure on the part of the Ministry\r\n\r\nnot  to take into consideration the problem of  human\r\n\r\nrelations  when  effecting changes  in  policy,  thus\r\n\r\nshowing an ignorance of the problems of our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is not possible for the Government to\r\n\r\nimplement a scheme of free secondary education, it is\r\n\r\nreasonably   expected   of  our   Government,   which\r\n\r\nsubscribes to pragmatic socialism, to bring secondary\r\n\r\neducation  within  the means of as many  citizens  as\r\n\r\npossible.   But,  contrary  to  such  reasonable   ex\r\n\r\npectations,  many citizens, particularly  those  from\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income  group, have  found  the  cost  of\r\n\r\neducating their children to a secondary level prohibi\r\n\r\ntively  expensive. As hon. Members of the  House  are\r\n\r\naware, every student in a secondary school has to pay\r\n\r\na  school  fee of $4 per month plus a fee of  $2  for\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous purposes, thus making a total of $6 per\r\n\r\nmonth.  The only students who are exempted  from  the\r\n\r\npayment  of  such fees are students of Malay  origin.\r\n\r\nOthers,  even those whose parents are in  receipt  of\r\n\r\npublic assistance from the Social Welfare Department,\r\n\r\nare  expected  to  pay  at least  a  fee  of  $1  for\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous  purposes. Thus even a student  from  a\r\n\r\nfamily  with no income at all is expected to  pay  at\r\n\r\nleast  a  fee  of  $1  per month for  the  luxury  of\r\n\r\nsecondary education, But the point I wish to make  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  conditions prescribed by the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  for the remission of school fees  from  $6\r\n\r\nper  month  to $1 per month are extremely  rigid  and\r\n\r\nrestrictive to such an extent that it is possible for\r\n\r\na student from a family in very difficult\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinancial  circumstances not to  be  granted  such  a\r\n\r\nremission  of school fees. I refer, Sir, to  the  two\r\n\r\nconditions which must be satisfied before  a  student\r\n\r\ncan be granted remission of school fees. The first is\r\n\r\nthat  the  income  of the student's family  does  not\r\n\r\nexceed  $200  per  month.  The  second  is  that  the\r\n\r\ngranting of such remission is subject to a maximum of\r\n\r\n10  per  cent  of the total enrolment in each  school\r\n\r\nbeing granted such remission.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what is the basis for the selection of\r\n\r\nthe magical figure of $200 per month\r\n\r\nfamily income as a means test for determining whether\r\n\r\na  student  qualifies for remission  of  school  fee,\r\n\r\nexemption  from the miscellaneous fee and entitlement\r\n\r\nto  free textbooks. I may be wrong, but it appears to\r\n\r\nme  that  the Ministry has chosen the figure of  $200\r\n\r\nbecause  that is the figure mentioned in the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund Ordinance for the purpose of exempting\r\n\r\nan  employee  from  making  contributions  under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  it  appears to be the  reasoning  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education that if a family bread-earner\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to  pay  C.P.F. contributions  from  his\r\n\r\nincome of more than $200 per month, he should be able\r\n\r\nto  pay  the school fees of his children in secondary\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever may be the actual reasons for the selection\r\n\r\nof  the  figure  of  $200 per month,  the  figure  is\r\n\r\narbitrary  and ridiculous as a means test.  Reference\r\n\r\nhere must be made to the Urban Incomes and Housing  -\r\n\r\na  Report  on the Social Survey of Singapore  1953-54\r\n\r\nprepared by our Finance Minister, Dr Goh Keng  Swee.\r\n\r\nOn  the  basis  of  data obtainable in  1953-54,  the\r\n\r\nresult of the survey indicates that a minimum monthly\r\n\r\nincome to sustain a family of four (man, wife and two\r\n\r\nchildren) in bare comfort is $101.85. Such  a  figure\r\n\r\nwas  arrived at on the basis of the bare necessities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as food, that are required for the survival  of\r\n\r\nthe family and do not take into consideration various\r\n\r\nluxury items such as cigarettes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  entertainment.  But most important  of  all,  no\r\n\r\naccount  was  taken of the expenses of educating  the\r\n\r\nchildren, not even at primary level, not to speak  of\r\n\r\nsecondary level.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor that was not taken into consideration\r\n\r\nis  the cost of housing for the family. Assuming that\r\n\r\nthe  family  is occupying the cheapest Housing  Board\r\n\r\naccommodation at $50 per month, it would appear  that\r\n\r\na  family of four requires at least $151 to house and\r\n\r\nfeed  itself  on  the basis of the  findings  in  the\r\n\r\n1953-54  Report.  But  from  our  investigations,  it\r\n\r\nappears  that  the  cost of living has  increased  by\r\n\r\nabout 20.5 per cent over the last 15 years since  the\r\n\r\nconduct  of the survey in 1953-54. I am quite certain\r\n\r\nthat  our  price index and cost of living index  etc.\r\n\r\nmay  even show that the cost of living has gone  down\r\n\r\nover  the  past few years. I am quite aware that  the\r\n\r\nprice  index,  the  cost of living  index  and  other\r\n\r\nstatistical  indices can be manipulated by  assigning\r\n\r\ndifferent weights to different components in indices.\r\n\r\nThus,  it  is  not surprising that it is possible  to\r\n\r\ncompile a price index to show that the cost of living\r\n\r\nhas gone down by 50 per cent while every housewife in\r\n\r\nSingapore has found, from bitter experience, that the\r\n\r\ncost  of  living has increased rather than decreased.\r\n\r\nTo  return to my point, however, I would say  that  a\r\n\r\nfamily  with an income of $200 per month can  barely\r\n\r\nafford secondary education for the children,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more so with the introduction of compulsory\r\n\r\ntechnical subjects in Secondary I and II, The  reason\r\n\r\nfor  the additional cost is the necessary expenditure\r\n\r\nof money for the purchase of drawing boards, workshop-aprons and geometrical instruments which are required\r\n\r\nfor  the  technical subjects. From inquiries  I  have\r\n\r\nmade,  the lowest amount that is required to be spent\r\n\r\non  the  purchase of such equipment is  approximately\r\n\r\n$15.  Besides such additional expenditure,  there  is\r\n\r\nthe normal expenditure for the purchase of textbooks.\r\n\r\nAgain, from inquiries I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade, I am able to quote the least amount of money\r\n\r\nthat must be spent on the necessary\r\n\r\ntextbooks for the secondary classes, The figures  are\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n         Secondary I    $35 (for textbooks alone)\r\n\r\n         Secondary II   $30\r\n\r\n         Secondary III  $59 (for pure Science Stream) \r\n\r\n                        $50 (for non-Science Stream)\r\n\r\n         Secondary IV   $30\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n                \r\n\r\n<br><br>These  figures are hypothetical figures based on  the\r\n\r\ncheapest  textbooks available. The actual figure  may\r\n\r\nbe  around $80 when all the other equipment is bought\r\n\r\nfor  each  of the secondary classes, as I  understand\r\n\r\neach school has its own selection of textbooks to  be\r\n\r\nused  by students. Thus it would be accurate  to  say\r\n\r\nthat to maintain a student in a secondary school,  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary for his parents to spend about  $50  or\r\n\r\n$60  a  year on books and other educational materials\r\n\r\nin  addition to the school fees of $6 per month which\r\n\r\nworks out roughly to an average of $11 per month  per\r\n\r\nstudent in a secondary class.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of boring Members of the House, I wish\r\n\r\nto stress that the cost of secondary education is too\r\n\r\nburdensome for a family in the lower income group.  I\r\n\r\nhave  previously referred to the remission of  school\r\n\r\nfees  by  the  Ministry of Education in the  case  of\r\n\r\nfamilies whose monthly income is less than $200. Such\r\n\r\nremission is again subject to the condition that only\r\n\r\na  maximum  of  10  per cent of the total  number  of\r\n\r\nstudents  enrolled in a particular school are  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed  such remission. Such a 10 per cent limit  is\r\n\r\nstrictly  applied irrespective of whether the  school\r\n\r\nis  situated in the urban or rural area. It stands to\r\n\r\nreason  that  a  greater percentage  of  students  in\r\n\r\nsecondary schools in the rural area are from families\r\n\r\nin  the lower income group as compared to students in\r\n\r\nsecondary   schools  in  the  urban  area.   Yet   no\r\n\r\nconsideration has been given by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Ministry to this fact in applying the rigid limit\r\n\r\nof  10 per cent of students to be given remission  of\r\n\r\nschool fees.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, on paper it may seem very grand that our\r\n\r\neducational  policy  permits the  maximum  number  of\r\n\r\nchildren  of  our citizens to avail themselves  of  a\r\n\r\nsecondary  education  with  the  assistance  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the position is not so rosy as I have\r\n\r\nshown  earlier. For instance, the remission of school\r\n\r\nfees for parents who are not financially well off  by\r\n\r\nreason  of  fixing  the arbitrary  figure  of  earned\r\n\r\nincome  of  $200  per  month  as  a  means  test  for\r\n\r\nqualifying for remission of school fees. It  is  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has a scheme  of  bursaries  or\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance for students in  the  secondary\r\n\r\nschools. The voted provision for such bursaries  this\r\n\r\nyear amounts to $1.35 million, which works out to  an\r\n\r\naverage   of  $8.40  per  student  in  the  secondary\r\n\r\nclasses.  This,  Members of  the  House  will  agree,\r\n\r\nhardly  bears  comparison with  the  actual  cost  of\r\n\r\ntextbooks  for a secondary class amounting  to  about\r\n\r\n$80 inclusive of school fees,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides shouldering the expenditure on school fees\r\n\r\nand  textbooks, parents also have to pay for the  bus\r\n\r\nfares  and  pocket  money of their children  who  are\r\n\r\nfortunate enough to be enrolled in secondary classes.\r\n\r\nThe  Secondary I pupils in some schools have to  stay\r\n\r\nbehind at least once a week for technical drawing and\r\n\r\nworkshop  practice and in some schools they  have  to\r\n\r\nstay  behind  twice a week because  of  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nworkshop  facilities  in  many  schools.  Again,   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the  policy of  our  Government  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a rugged society, students are now  required\r\n\r\nto  participate  in  more  and  more  extracurricular\r\n\r\nactivities.  With  the  extensions  of   sports   and\r\n\r\nathletic meets and parades of uniformed organisations\r\n\r\nat  various levels, it becomes increasingly necessary\r\n\r\nsometimes  for  students to spend the  whole  day  in\r\n\r\nschool.  For instance, those in the morning  sessions\r\n\r\nhave to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome  in  the afternoon to participate in  extramural\r\n\r\nactivities.  For those in the afternoon sessions,  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary for the students concerned to  come  to\r\n\r\nschool  in the morning. If the students do not return\r\n\r\nhome  they  have to spend additional money  on  some\r\n\r\nnecessary  refreshments. If they go  home  for  their\r\n\r\nmeals,  it  is necessary for them to incur additional\r\n\r\nbus fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving vent to the grievances and grouses of\r\n\r\nparents in the lower income groups whose children are\r\n\r\nattending  secondary schools. I am in agreement  with\r\n\r\ntheir justified contention that the cost of secondary\r\n\r\neducation could have been minimised to some extent if\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry had exercised some imagination in  this\r\n\r\ndirection. I have, therefore, two suggestions to  put\r\n\r\nforward  for the consideration of the Ministry.  They\r\n\r\nare:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The creation and maintenance of a central poo1\r\n\r\nof  teaching  aids and implements such as  T-squares.\r\n\r\nset  squares and other geometrical instruments of the\r\n\r\ntype   required   for  technical   drawing.   It   is\r\n\r\nappreciated  that consumer articles such as  pencils,\r\n\r\npins and stationery do not lend themselves to such  a\r\n\r\npooling arrangement, but a school can arrange for the\r\n\r\nbulk  purchase of such material and sell them without\r\n\r\nprofit to the students. This will help to save untold\r\n\r\ntrouble   for  the  parents  and  the  students   who\r\n\r\ninvariably  have to spend a lot of time  hunting  for\r\n\r\nparticular  types  that  have  been  recommended   by\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A more liberal policy of awarding bursaries or\r\n\r\nremission of school fees and the loan of textbooks to\r\n\r\nstudents whose parents are not financially well off.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these two suggestions, I am fully\r\n\r\ncognisant  of the fact that the education  budget  is\r\n\r\nalready very high and that we cannot go on increasing\r\n\r\nthe   budget  just  to  afford  an  opportunity   for\r\n\r\nsecondary  education to students  who  may  not  even\r\n\r\ncomplete the full course of secondary education.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the same, it is the avowed policy of our\r\n\r\nGovernment  that no student is to be deprived  of  an\r\n\r\neducation because of financial hardship. A survey  of\r\n\r\nthe drop-outs from secondary schools, I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsure,  will  reveal  interesting  facts  and  figures\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  family income of such  students  who\r\n\r\nhave dropped out of school. I do not know whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is planning to undertake such  a  survey,\r\n\r\nparticularly in relation to the socio-economic aspect\r\n\r\nof the home environment of the students who drop out.\r\n\r\nBut I do know that financial hardship is the real, if\r\n\r\nnot   the  main  reason  for  parents  to  plead  for\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance for their children who  are  in\r\n\r\nsecondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that nothing can be given free, but we must\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  plight of families who  cannot  even\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay  the  school fees of  their  children\r\n\r\nattending  secondary schools.  I  am  sure  that  our\r\n\r\nefficient  Minister  for  Education  will  give   his\r\n\r\nsympathetic   consideration  to  the  very   pressing\r\n\r\nproblems of the underprivileged children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for\r\n\r\na  moment, I thought the Member for Telok Blangah was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  give us new proposals whereby we can  give\r\n\r\neveryone  free  secondary  education.  But,   unfortu\r\n\r\nnately, they were not forthcoming.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I reply to all the queries raised by the\r\n\r\nMember, may I just state some facts?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Ministry of Education had the\r\n\r\nlargest share of the national budget. It amounted  to\r\n\r\nnearly a quarter of the national budget. In fact,  it\r\n\r\nis the highest in developing countries, if not one of\r\n\r\nthe  highest in the world. Even in Japan, it  amounts\r\n\r\nto only 22 per cent.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1968 budget, of the $152 million allocated to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education, some $50 million was spent\r\n\r\non  secondary  education. This does not  include  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  tertiary education, administration and  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  training  the  teachers  at  the  Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College. The cost per student works  out  to\r\n\r\n$360  per student per annum. As far as Government  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  $1 out of every $4 is spent on education.\r\n\r\nThe amount spent on a student also works\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  to  about  15 per cent of the per  capita  Gross\r\n\r\nNational Product for last year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to the expenses borne by the parents,\r\n\r\n1  would like to remind the Member for Telok Blangah,\r\n\r\nwho, I believe, was a former committee member of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Teachers' Union, that our secondary  school\r\n\r\nteachers at the present moment are working an average\r\n\r\nof  18 hours per week, which compares very favourably\r\n\r\nwith  secondary school teachers everywhere  else  who\r\n\r\nwork an average of 22 hours per week. Their salary is\r\n\r\none  of  the highest in the world and the highest  in\r\n\r\nthis  region. In fact, I would like to add that  some\r\n\r\nof  the  teachers and principals of secondary schools\r\n\r\nare  drawing  salaries  much  higher  than  those  of\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the expenses borne by parents? As\r\n\r\nthe  Member correctly pointed out, parents pay $6 per\r\n\r\nmonth for their child's school fees and miscellaneous\r\n\r\nfees  and  every  year  pay some  $60  on  textbooks,\r\n\r\nexercise books, uniforms, etc. This works out to some\r\n\r\n$11  per  month.  May I ask the  Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah a question? Can anyone truly say that he  has\r\n\r\nnever  foolishly wasted $11 per month  if,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthat  $11  can  be  wisely  spent  on  the  secondary\r\n\r\neducation of his child?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to point out some wrong impressions the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Telok  Blangah  gave.  First  of   all,\r\n\r\nremission of fees is for 15 per cent and not  10  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  the school student population. And  in  the\r\n\r\nless  affluent  rural areas, the percentage  is  much\r\n\r\nmore.  I  also  wish  to point out  that  some  9.000\r\n\r\nstudents  are at present receiving bursaries  at  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  level, representing some six per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe student population at this level. In other words.\r\n\r\na  total of 21 per cent of the student population are\r\n\r\nnot paying any fees. In 1968, 8,000 students obtained\r\n\r\nfree  textbooks; this makes up another six per  cent.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  27 per cent of the student population  at\r\n\r\nthis level, one way or other, directly or indirectly,\r\n\r\nare being subsidised \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby the Government. This is over and above the\r\n\r\n$360  which the Government is paying for their  education,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah  to the fact that while  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  has increased slightly - I will leave  it  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance to contest the figure of  20\r\n\r\nper  cent  which I recall was brought up in the  last\r\n\r\nBudget  debate the expenses borne by the  parents  of\r\n\r\nstudents  at  the  secondary  level  have,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ndecreased.  I  recall that when  I  was  a  secondary\r\n\r\nstudent,  I  paid  $15 per month for  fees  while  my\r\n\r\nteachers  were  drawing a salary of  a  hundred  over\r\n\r\ndollars.  Now  they are getting over $1,000  and  the\r\n\r\nschool  fees  have come down to $4.  Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nfigure of 27 per cent does not include those students\r\n\r\ncoming  under  social welfare relief  cases.  I  must\r\n\r\nadmit that I was unable to get this particular figure\r\n\r\nin time for this debate.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, due to the remarkable success of this Government in improving the social conditions of the nation particularly in the field of education. I am afraid some people have come to a stage where they are taking everything for granted. They expect things to be free. I must remind Members that nothing is\r\n\r\nfree  in Singapore. In fact, at very moment, the very\r\n\r\nair that we are breathing is being paid for.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to inform Members that any further\r\n\r\nsubsidy  for secondary education has to be met  by  a\r\n\r\ncorresponding  cut somewhere else.  Will  the  Member\r\n\r\nsuggest   that   the  teachers  would  volunteer   to\r\n\r\nsubsidise secondary education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

His  figures for induced abortions were  1,676\r\n\r\nfor  a six-month period in 1964, i.e. 3,352 projected\r\n\r\nfor the year. He also estimated that the total number\r\n\r\nof abortions occurring in Singapore would probably be\r\n\r\nabout  6,000  a year. My predecessor, replying  to  a\r\n\r\nquestion in Parliament on abortions, quoted the  same\r\n\r\nsource   for  his  figures  on  estimated  abortions.\r\n\r\n(Hansard  -  Thursday, 7th September 1967,  Vol.  26, Columns 95 and 96).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my answers, it can be inferred that abortions\r\n\r\ncarried out (for medical reasons) in the Hospital are\r\n\r\nsafe since no deaths occurred in the entire series in\r\n\r\nthe   last  two  years.  In  comparison,  the  deaths\r\n\r\nrecorded from abortions treated in the Hospital  were\r\n\r\ndeaths from those who had in all probability been criminally  aborted  outside and were brought  into  the\r\n\r\nHospital  for  treatment. The comparative  safety  of\r\n\r\nabortions  done  under  the  Hospital  conditions  is\r\n\r\nfurther confirmed by comparison with deaths resulting\r\n\r\nfrom   childbirth.  Whereas  there  were  no   deaths\r\n\r\nresulting  from therapeutic abortions, there  were  a\r\n\r\nfew  deaths resulting from childbirth in the Hospital\r\n\r\n(0.5 and 0.3 per thousand of births) as appears in my\r\n\r\nanswer to another question filed by the hon. Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CHILDBIRTHS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L. P.

Hence,  unless  the\r\n\r\nmorbid condition occurred soon after birth, no  infor\r\n\r\nmation will be available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of deaths given in my answer should be\r\n\r\nrelated to the total number of births in the Hospital\r\n\r\nwhich were 38,252 and 36,727 respectively. This gives\r\n\r\na  maternal mortality rate per thousand births at 0.5\r\n\r\nand  0.33 respectively. Maternal mortality is defined\r\n\r\nas  the  number  of  women  dying  shortly  following\r\n\r\nchildbirth whether a child was born alive or at still\r\n\r\nbirth.  The  number of deaths is usually given  as  a\r\n\r\nrate,  i.e. total number of maternal mortalities  per\r\n\r\nthousand  births. The latest figures  available  from\r\n\r\nthe  overall maternal mortality rate in Singapore  in\r\n\r\n1965 and 1966 were 0.4 and 0.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
