Although vested  with\r\n\r\nthe  powers of prosecution under section 69 of the\r\n\r\nAct,  the Ministry has yet to invoke this  section\r\n\r\nagainst any workers for two reasons. Firstly,  the\r\n\r\nFactory  Inspectorate of the  Ministry  was  until\r\n\r\nrecently  understaffed, and strict enforcement  of\r\n\r\nthe Act was therefore not possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, and more important, reason is that\r\n\r\nit  is  better to inculcate in the workers a sense\r\n\r\nof  safety  consciousness  through  education  and\r\n\r\npersuasion.  Towards this end, appeals  have  been\r\n\r\nmade   both  inside  and  outside  Parliament   to\r\n\r\nemployers   and  employees  to  observe   strictly\r\n\r\nvarious safety rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factory Inspectorate, through its\r\n\r\nnewsletters, has been harping on the tune that  it\r\n\r\nis  only  through  the concerted  efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers, the employers and the Government that  we\r\n\r\ncan  hope  to  cut  down the  rate  of  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents. The National Trades Union Congress, the\r\n\r\nNational   Safety   First   Council   and    other\r\n\r\norganisations  have  also  supported  this   call.\r\n\r\nHowever,  these  appeals have apparently  achieved\r\n\r\nvery  little  or  no  result,  as  the  number  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents due to the  irresponsibility\r\n\r\nof the employers and the negligence of the workers\r\n\r\nhas not shown any sign of a decrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, my Ministry will commence action\r\n\r\nto  prosecute both employers and employees if they\r\n\r\ncontravene the provisions of the Factories Act  or\r\n\r\nany  regulations made thereunder. I would like  to\r\n\r\nenlist  the support of every Member of this  House\r\n\r\nwhen we take this stern but necessary action so as\r\n\r\nto  protect the welfare, health and safety of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I ask the Minister how many Factory Inspectors\r\n\r\nhave  been recruited this year?

Many of them  have,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  been appointed only recently and  they  are\r\n\r\nstill  undergoing training. So their effectiveness\r\n\r\nwill  not be as expected.

However,\r\n\r\neviction  is  only  imposed if the  offence  is  a\r\n\r\nserious   one,  e.g.,  where  the  flat  is   used\r\n\r\nillegally as a common gaming house, a brothel or a\r\n\r\nden  in  which opium or ganja is smoked  or  other\r\n\r\ndrugs are used or kept, or where the tenant  or  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  his household assaults an official  of\r\n\r\nthe  Board.

Mr Oser claimed that Dr  Olney's\r\n\r\nobservations  did  not have any relevance  to  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the safety of MSG as a food seasoning\r\n\r\nagent  largely because the MSG was injected  under\r\n\r\nthe  skin  of  mice. The critical experiments,  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  should  involve feeding MSG orally  to  the\r\n\r\nanimals. Dr Olney's experiments had also been done\r\n\r\nby  using  doses far in excess of  what  has  been\r\n\r\nnormally used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Expert Committee jointly formed by the Food\r\n\r\nand  Agriculture Organisation and the World Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation  on Food Additives was, however,  not\r\n\r\nable to evaluate the evidence and come to specific\r\n\r\nconclusions in 1970. The report, which appeared in\r\n\r\nthe  W.H.O.  Technical Report, Series No.  445  at\r\n\r\npage 20, paragraph 3.4 is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Glutamic acid is a normal constituent of dietary\r\n\r\nproteins  and  also occurs freely in many  natural\r\n\r\nfoods. It is itself used as a condiment and is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  constituent of other  condiments  (e.g.\r\n\r\nsoy   sauce).  The  present  state  of   knowledge\r\n\r\nconcerning  monosodium  glutamate  was   reviewed.\r\n\r\nAlthough  attention  has recently  been  drawn  to\r\n\r\nadverse acute effects from ingestion of foods high\r\n\r\nin  free glutamate content the Committee considers\r\n\r\nthat it is unable to advise any restriction on use\r\n\r\nat  the present time. It was considered that self-limitation of intake of foods containing glutamate\r\n\r\nby  susceptible  individuals  would  be  possible.\r\n\r\nSince  there is a considerable amount of  work  in\r\n\r\nprogress  the  Committee postponed evaluations  of\r\n\r\nthis compound as a food additive until the results\r\n\r\nof the current work are available.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Expert Committee reported a year later, in\r\n\r\n1971,  that  although the weight of evidence  does\r\n\r\nnot   support   the  contention  that   monosodium\r\n\r\nglutamate as an additive in the diet can  lead  to\r\n\r\nbrain damage in humans, caution is desirable.  The\r\n\r\nfood  manufacturers, however, have decided to play\r\n\r\nit  safe. In 1969, the manufacturers of baby foods\r\n\r\nin North America imposed a voluntary ban on it and\r\n\r\nBritish firms followed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these countries are the main sources of\r\n\r\nbaby  foods imported into Singapore, it would  not\r\n\r\nbe  necessary to take any other action with regard\r\n\r\nto  banning  of  this additive in  baby  foods  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if we are to ban the use of monosodium\r\n\r\nglutamate in baby food preparations, the  relevant\r\n\r\nquestion that will arise will be how effective  it\r\n\r\nwill  be in actual practice. Can we, for instance,\r\n\r\ncontrol its use in food preparations at home which\r\n\r\nmay  be  given  to  children and  babies?  Another\r\n\r\nrelevant question is that if it has ill effects on\r\n\r\nthe  brain  of humans, which is questionable,  why\r\n\r\nshould  the  restriction of its use be limited  to\r\n\r\nbaby foods only, since the human brain is known to\r\n\r\ncontinue  development right up to  full  maturity,\r\n\r\nwhich  is at the age of 20 to 25 years? Thus,  for\r\n\r\nthe move of banning it to be logical and effective\r\n\r\nin  practice, you must ban it completely, that is,\r\n\r\nby  banning its importation and manufacture, which\r\n\r\nclearly does not merit it in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to be on the cautious side,\r\n\r\nall  our  Maternal and Child Health  Clinics  have\r\n\r\nbeen  instructed  to  warn  mothers  against   the\r\n\r\nexcessive use of monosodium glutamate as  well  as\r\n\r\nto  actively discourage them from using it at  all\r\n\r\nwhen preparing baby foods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HAWKER INSPECTORS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Seizure of goods of hawkers who have committed offences)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth   if   he  will  consider  the   issue   of\r\n\r\ninstructions to Hawker Inspectors not to take away\r\n\r\nthe  goods,  etc., of hawkers to  whom  they  have\r\n\r\nissued notices of offence for causing obstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, the\r\n\r\nseizure  of  goods of hawkers who  have  committed\r\n\r\noffences  is only resorted to in cases where  they\r\n\r\nbelong   to   incorrigible  hawkers   who   choose\r\n\r\npersistently to flout the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal circumstances, the Hawker Inspectorate\r\n\r\nonly issue notices to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffenders  for  committing an  offence  under  the\r\n\r\nhawkers' law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law provides for seizure of goods in\r\n\r\naddition to a fine, for certain good reasons,  for\r\n\r\nexample, to prevent hawkers selling at unspecified\r\n\r\nsites  and  prohibited areas which invariably  are\r\n\r\nareas which have been cleared of hawkers.

Allowing hawking\r\n\r\nthereon  will not only force the pedestrians  onto\r\n\r\nthe roadway, thereby endangering their safety, but\r\n\r\nwill  also  hamper  the loading and  unloading  of\r\n\r\ngoods  to and from the shops on both sides of  the\r\n\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if we are to allow hawking on the\r\n\r\nfive-f  footways  along North  Bridge  Road  which\r\n\r\ninvariably   form  the  frontage  of   shops,   as\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Member for Bras Basah,  we  would\r\n\r\nbe condoning unfair competition to the shopkeepers\r\n\r\nfrom  the hawkers.

Even if gold can be so  acquired,\r\n\r\nthere  is  some  disadvantage in holding  most  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's external reserves in gold. Gold stored\r\n\r\nin  vaults does not earn any income - and in  fact\r\n\r\nstorage   and   security   costs   are   incurred.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  we do believe that we  should  hold\r\n\r\nsome  part  of  our reserves in gold.

Our currency backing\r\n\r\nis  in  the  form of gold and in foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nreserves,  and  these reserves  have  enabled  the\r\n\r\nCurrency Board to earn over SS21 million  for  the\r\n\r\nyear  ended  31st December, 1970.

This provision is necessary\r\n\r\nto   ensure  minimum  disruption  to  the  public\r\n\r\ntransport  system  should  any  difficulty  arise\r\n\r\nwhich may result in the delay of the sale of  the\r\n\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself\r\n\r\ninto a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REARRANGEMENT OF ORDER OF BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That, under Standing Order 10 (2), a motion for\r\n\r\nthe election of a person to perform the functions\r\n\r\nof the Speaker be taken immediately before item 1\r\n\r\nof public business on the Order Paper.\" - [Mr E.

Such\r\n\r\nbenefits  are  usually agreed  upon  between  the\r\n\r\nemployer and the workers in collective agreements\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  employer agrees to pay gratuity  or\r\n\r\nother  sums  of  money  to  the  workers  on  the\r\n\r\ntermination of the latter's services. However, it\r\n\r\nhas  been  discovered that in  the  event  of  an\r\n\r\nemployer's company or business being in financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties  or  is wound up or  foreclosed,  no\r\n\r\nlegal  protection is afforded to the  workers  to\r\n\r\nrecover their gratuity or other benefits provided\r\n\r\nin the collective agreements. Such a situation is\r\n\r\nclearly  untenable, because it is  not  right  or\r\n\r\njust that these workers, having put in long years\r\n\r\nof  faithful  service, are suddenly denied  their\r\n\r\nright to the entitlement of the gratuity or other\r\n\r\nbenefits through no fault of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, proposed that the Employment\r\n\r\nAct  be  amended  to  ensure  that  the  workers'\r\n\r\nexpectations    of   receiving   some    monetary\r\n\r\ncompensation  to tide over their  twilight  years\r\n\r\nare   not   needlessly  dashed  by  circumstances\r\n\r\noutside their control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 45 of the Act will\r\n\r\nensure that, in the event of the employer winding\r\n\r\nup  his  company or business, the rights  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  to  gratuity  and other  benefits  would\r\n\r\nattract  priority of payment over other unsecured\r\n\r\ndebts. That is to say, when a company is wound up\r\n\r\nor  foreclosed, the payments due to the employees\r\n\r\nin  respect of retirement, retrenchment or  other\r\n\r\nsuch  benefits  would  be payable  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance  before  the claims of  other  unsecured\r\n\r\ncreditors are met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to rectify another anomaly\r\n\r\ncurrently  found  in the Act. Subsection  (2)  of\r\n\r\nsection  95  of  the Act provides  for  maternity\r\n\r\nbenefit  entitlement to a female workman who  has\r\n\r\nworked for an employer for not less than 180 days\r\n\r\nwithin   the   period  of  one  year  immediately\r\n\r\npreceding    her   confinement.   The   maternity\r\n\r\nallowance  payable under this section is  at  the\r\n\r\nrate of $4 a day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  at  her  ordinary rate of pay  for  one  day,\r\n\r\nwhichever  is less during the benefit period.  It\r\n\r\nwould appear that this restriction on the maximum\r\n\r\nof  $4  a day is outdated and unfair in the light\r\n\r\nof  the  present-day wage structure and  economic\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey on wages carried out by my\r\n\r\nMinistry,  it  has  been found  that  in  several\r\n\r\nindustries  a  large  number  of  female   manual\r\n\r\nworkers are already in receipt of more than $4  a\r\n\r\nday  as  wages. We are of the view that  where  a\r\n\r\nfemale workman is paid more than $4 a day,  there\r\n\r\nis no reason why she should not be entitled to  a\r\n\r\nfull day's pay whilst on maternity leave. It  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, proposed to remove the maximum of $4 a\r\n\r\nday set in the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr N.

I  quote  from\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 26, No. 16, col. 1111:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On becoming redundant, most of the employees\r\n\r\nwill  get  a  sizable sum of money  as  redundancy\r\n\r\npayments.   Many  of  them  are  unaccustomed   to\r\n\r\nhandling substantial sums of money at any one time\r\n\r\nthe  basic  aim of this legislation is  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  money they receive is not used unwisely\r\n\r\nand in-judiciously, which will make them destitute\r\n\r\nin  a  short  period  and  bring  them  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies great distress.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past three years, nearly 18,000 base\r\n\r\nworkers  have  been retrenched  from  the  British\r\n\r\nbases.  As  a result of the careful husbanding  of\r\n\r\ntheir   redundancy  payments,   they   have   been\r\n\r\nprotected   from  acute  financial   distress   or\r\n\r\npersonal  hardship.  Further,  with  the   British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal nearing completion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  nation  as  a  whole has not experienced  any\r\n\r\nserious  social  upheaval or economic  dislocation\r\n\r\nwhich  would have occurred if Government  had  not\r\n\r\nacted to safeguard the interest of the workers and\r\n\r\ntheir families. Yet the Act was criticised in some\r\n\r\nquarters and accusations were hurled to the effect\r\n\r\nthat  the  redundancy payments  belonging  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers were taken away and used as revenue.  Time\r\n\r\nhas  shown that Government action in enacting  the\r\n\r\nlaw  to  safeguard  redundancy payments  has  been\r\n\r\ncorrect  and the sorry spectacle of workers  being\r\n\r\nreduced  to  poverty after frittering  away  their\r\n\r\nhard-earned money has been avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst previously the Redundancy Payments Fund\r\n\r\nAct  was applied only to redundant workers, it  is\r\n\r\nthe  intention now to expand the coverage  of  the\r\n\r\nAct.  The  proposed  amendment  will  enable   all\r\n\r\npayments  made to the employee on the  termination\r\n\r\nof  his services by reason of his employer ceasing\r\n\r\nto  carry  on business for whatever reason  to  be\r\n\r\npaid  to the Redundancy Payments Fund. This  would\r\n\r\nenable  any payments made in respect of retirement\r\n\r\nbenefits  and other gratuities payable  under  the\r\n\r\nterms  of a collective agreement or award  on  the\r\n\r\nwinding  up  of  the  company,  according  to  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  (Amendment) Bill  which  I  introduced\r\n\r\nearlier,  to be paid into the Redundancy  Payments\r\n\r\nFund  instead of direct to the employee.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  the  Fund  can be used to  conserve  in  the\r\n\r\nemployee's best interest the money due to  him  on\r\n\r\nthe  termination of his services on account of his\r\n\r\nemployer ceasing to carry on business for whatever\r\n\r\nreason  and  thus  prevent such money  from  being\r\n\r\nunwisely dissipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Ong Pang Boon].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr N.

The Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  is no exception in this  use  of  the\r\n\r\ncommon seal. However, at present section 10 of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Polytechnic Act requires two conditions\r\n\r\nto  be  satisfied before the common  seal  can  be\r\n\r\naffixed  to any instrument. Firstly, the  Chairman\r\n\r\nor  a  member of the Board and the principal  will\r\n\r\nhave  to sign the instrument. Secondly, these same\r\n\r\npersons  will  both  have to be  present  together\r\n\r\nwhile  the  seal is being affixed.  Therefore,  in\r\n\r\naffixing   the   common  seal  to  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  diplomas  and  certificates,  certain\r\n\r\nobvious difficulties arise. When a small number of\r\n\r\ndiplomas  and certificates is involved, compliance\r\n\r\nwith  this formality is tolerable though  irksome.\r\n\r\nWhile the expansion, as envisaged, to develop  the\r\n\r\nsite  to  the  north-west  of  Dover  Road  is  in\r\n\r\nprogress,  it  is  expected  that  the  number  of\r\n\r\ngraduates will rise steadily to well over 1,600 by\r\n\r\n1976-77  when  the  new  campus  will  have   been\r\n\r\ncompleted. Under such circumstances, the  affixing\r\n\r\nof  the common seal to each and every diploma  and\r\n\r\ncertificate will become excessively cumbersome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Polytechnic intends that each of\r\n\r\nthe  technician  diploma and certificate  will  in\r\n\r\nfuture  continue to bear the common  seal  and  be\r\n\r\nindividually signed by the principal and the  head\r\n\r\nof  the  school concerned.

Thus a new  medical  school\r\n\r\nwhich on inspection by the G.M.C, of U.K, is found\r\n\r\nin  the  content of its course, training standards\r\n\r\nand  examinations to be of acceptable standard  is\r\n\r\nput on the list. Thus, for instance, an inspection\r\n\r\nteam  from the General Medical Council of the U.K.\r\n\r\nvisited  the  Faculty  of  Medicine  and  teaching\r\n\r\nhospital  in Kuala Lumpur before its degrees  were\r\n\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two drawbacks are inherent in this arrangement,\r\n\r\nand they are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Medical schools which do not ask to be\r\n\r\nincluded in the list would obviously not  ever  be\r\n\r\nincluded in the list of recognised qualifications.\r\n\r\nHence,  there are very conspicuous omissions  from\r\n\r\nthe   list.  For  example,  the  medical   degrees\r\n\r\nconferred by McGill University, Montreal,  Canada,\r\n\r\nwere   at   one  time  on  the  recognised   list.\r\n\r\nApparently, because the University in Montreal did\r\n\r\nnot  agree to accept inspection by a team from the\r\n\r\nGeneral   Medical  Council  in   the   U.K.,   its\r\n\r\nqualifications were subsequently dropped. Thus, we\r\n\r\nget  an  anomalous position where one of the  most\r\n\r\nprestigious  of  medical  schools  in  the   North\r\n\r\nAmerican  continent is no longer on  the  list  of\r\n\r\nrecognised qualifications accepted by the G.M.C. -\r\n\r\nand thus also accepted by us - whereas smaller and\r\n\r\nless  prestigious medical schools in Canada,  such\r\n\r\nas  Saskatchewan, the Dalhousie University of Nova\r\n\r\nScotia, are on the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) There are no regular or periodic\r\n\r\ninspections.  Inspections generally  are  made  on\r\n\r\ninvitation by the medical schools. Once a  medical\r\n\r\nschool  is placed on the list, it is left  on  the\r\n\r\nlist. It will remain on the list even though there\r\n\r\nis  information that the standards have gone down,\r\n\r\nfor   it  is  usually  not  removed  except  after\r\n\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be several methods which might be\r\n\r\nadopted  to  meet these drawbacks to  our  present\r\n\r\nsystem of registration. One is not to have a  list\r\n\r\nof recognised qualifications at all. In place of a\r\n\r\nlist  of recognised schools, registration  may  be\r\n\r\ndone by examination. Thus, without exception,  any\r\n\r\nperson applying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  registration will be required to sit and pass\r\n\r\na  registration  examination.  This  is  a  system\r\n\r\nadopted in the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries have adopted the other extreme,\r\n\r\nthat  is, they would accept any person who  has  a\r\n\r\nmedical  qualification and who could show evidence\r\n\r\nthat  he  has been registered to practise  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry  where  he had obtained the qualification.\r\n\r\nThis  system is adopted by countries which do  not\r\n\r\nhave  their  own  medical  school.  It  would  not\r\n\r\nobviously  be  acceptable in  an  independent  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped  state with its own medical school  such\r\n\r\nas ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, however, chosen a compromise solution\r\n\r\nto  this problem by proposing the adoption of  our\r\n\r\nown  list of recognised qualifications. This  list\r\n\r\nwhich  we  propose  to  adopt  is  attached  as  a\r\n\r\nSchedule to the Bill. It is, in essence, the  same\r\n\r\nlist as the G.M.C, list but with certain additions\r\n\r\nand deletions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has been taken to add on the list\r\n\r\nmedical  schools  from  outside  the  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nwhose international reputation and prestige no one\r\n\r\ncan  gainsay. They include the medical schools  of\r\n\r\nColumbia,  Ann Arbor, Michigan, to  cite  .a  few,\r\n\r\nfrom  the United States, a German, a Dutch  and  a\r\n\r\nFrench medical school from Europe. From the  Asian\r\n\r\nregion, the schools included are the University of\r\n\r\nPhilippines  in Manila and the Medical  School  of\r\n\r\nTokyo  University. McGill Medical School in Canada\r\n\r\nhas also been included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In completing our local list, omissions of a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  medical schools from the  G.M.C, list\r\n\r\nhave  also  been made. This has been done  in  the\r\n\r\nface   of   reports   of  malpractices   regarding\r\n\r\nadmissions   of  poor  candidates,  tampering   of\r\n\r\nexamination results and deteriorating standards in\r\n\r\nthese schools which gave us little alternative but\r\n\r\nto   drop   them   from  the  list   of   approved\r\n\r\nqualifications.  These deletions  were  made  also\r\n\r\nafter   consultation  with  the   Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission which had made a special study of it. I\r\n\r\nwould, however, like to point out here that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby   dropping  them  from  the  list  of  approved\r\n\r\nqualifications  we  are not  in  any  way  casting\r\n\r\naspersions  on the good name which some  of  these\r\n\r\nmedical schools have acquired and their proud past\r\n\r\nrecords  and  on  their  graduates  who  might  be\r\n\r\neminent  scientists and practitioners who  can  be\r\n\r\nfound  throughout the world. But in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nreports referred to, we have no alternative but to\r\n\r\nplay  safe  and make a general deletion  of  these\r\n\r\nschools from our list of recognised qualifications\r\n\r\nin  the  interest of protecting the  present  high\r\n\r\nstandards of medical practice in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to make it very clear here that\r\n\r\nthe  local list of recognised qualifications which\r\n\r\nwe  have  proposed to adopt is in no way permanent\r\n\r\nnor  is it exhaustive, since we are in no position\r\n\r\nat  this stage to consider the inclusion of  every\r\n\r\nsingle  medical  school in  the  world.  Thus  the\r\n\r\namendments   also  provide  that   the   list   of\r\n\r\nrecognised   qualifications  can  be   varied   by\r\n\r\nadditions or deletions made from time to  time  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister after consulting the Medical Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(2)   On  the registration of persons who  do  not\r\n\r\npossess recognised qualifications:</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present law, the registration of\r\n\r\npersons    who    do   not   possess    recognised\r\n\r\nqualifications  may  be  made  by  order  of   the\r\n\r\nMinister after consulting the Medical Council. The\r\n\r\nMedical  Council will advise the Minister on  each\r\n\r\napplication and the Minister may, on the basis  of\r\n\r\nthis  advice, determine the order to  be  made  in\r\n\r\neach  case.  Under  the proposed  amendment,  this\r\n\r\npractice will in substance remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, regard has been taken of a deficiency\r\n\r\nin  the  existing  provision in that  the  Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil,   in  advising  the  Minister   on   such\r\n\r\napplications,   has  to  depend  on   the   papers\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to it. The Medical Council,  therefore,\r\n\r\nhas to make their recommendations based mainly  on\r\n\r\npaper  qualifications and hearsay  evidence.  This\r\n\r\ncan  sometimes  make  it very  difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Council to arrive at a decision,  because\r\n\r\nthe Medical Council cannot possibly know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe standards of each and every medical school  in\r\n\r\nthe world, and more particularly the competence of\r\n\r\nan individual applicant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome this defect, the amendment proposed\r\n\r\nis  to  allow  in  those cases where  the  Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil  is not able to determine on the standards\r\n\r\nof  the  qualifications submitted by the applicant\r\n\r\nand particularly if there are doubts regarding his\r\n\r\ncompetence,  and, before it advises the  Minister,\r\n\r\nto   subject   the  applicant  to  a  registration\r\n\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of examination will be left to the\r\n\r\nMedical  Council.  This could  be  a  full-fledged\r\n\r\nexamination  consisting of practical, written  and\r\n\r\noral  parts.  In some cases, however,  it  may  be\r\n\r\nlimited to an oral interview. This will allow  the\r\n\r\nMedical   Council   to  be   more   objective   in\r\n\r\ndetermining the competence of the person  applying\r\n\r\nfor registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(3) Temporary registration:</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing law for temporary registration only\r\n\r\nprovides  for persons who are engaged in  research\r\n\r\nand training. In actual practice, it is given only\r\n\r\nfor  medical persons engaged by the University for\r\n\r\nresearch and teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, other categories of persons\r\n\r\nbesides those engaged in the University who should\r\n\r\nalso  qualify  for  temporary  registration.   For\r\n\r\nexample, they may be eminent specialists  who  are\r\n\r\nbrought  out not only to train or teach, but  also\r\n\r\nto  conduct  special work amongst patients.  There\r\n\r\nhave  been  instances where eminent surgeons  have\r\n\r\nbeen  invited  to  treat special cases  which  the\r\n\r\nlocal  surgeons felt could be best done  by  these\r\n\r\neminent surgeons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further category of persons who may require\r\n\r\ntemporary  registration are  persons  who  are  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  working  in the hospitals  and  medical\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to obtain special experience  or  to\r\n\r\nfulfil  their  training  requirements  for  higher\r\n\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments will now provide for the\r\n\r\ntemporary   registration   of   these   additional\r\n\r\ncategories of persons afore-mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(4)    Conditions of registration:</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is presently stipulated in the law, certain\r\n\r\nconditions may be imposed only in cases of persons\r\n\r\nwho  are registered by order of the Minister under\r\n\r\nsection  9 (1) (c) of the Act. It is now  proposed\r\n\r\nto allow for conditions to be imposed also when  a\r\n\r\nperson is to be registered temporarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, it is also proposed to provide a\r\n\r\ngeneral condition to apply to the registration  of\r\n\r\nall persons. This is that the Medical Council must\r\n\r\nbe  satisfied  that the applicant for registration\r\n\r\nis  of  \"good  fame and character\"  before  he  is\r\n\r\nregistered. The interpretation of this phrase  \"of\r\n\r\ngood  fame and character\" will, in practice,  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  person  is certified  at  the  time  of\r\n\r\napplication to be of good character, and if he  is\r\n\r\nregistered in another country, he is still on that\r\n\r\nregister,   and  that  there  are  no  proceedings\r\n\r\npending   or  have  been  made  against  him   for\r\n\r\nmisconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposed provision is fairly commonly\r\n\r\nadopted  in other countries and it is to safeguard\r\n\r\nagainst  the  occasional case where a person,  who\r\n\r\nhas   been  struck  off  the  list  of  registered\r\n\r\npractitioners   in  one  country,  transfers   his\r\n\r\npractice  to  another  country.  This,  in   fact,\r\n\r\noccurred on at least one occasion in Singapore. In\r\n\r\nthis  case,  a  practitioner was found  guilty  of\r\n\r\nmisconduct in a state outside of Singapore and was\r\n\r\nstruck  off the register there, but was registered\r\n\r\nin  Singapore even though it was known that he had\r\n\r\nbeen struck off from the register in that country.\r\n\r\nNothing   could  be  done  since  there  were   no\r\n\r\nprovisions then to prevent his registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, essential that this amendment\r\n\r\nbe accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(5) Membership  of  the  Medical  Council  of Singapore:</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be clearly seen, the Medical Council\r\n\r\nplays  an  important role in the  registration  of\r\n\r\npractitioners and it is the governing body on  the\r\n\r\nconduct of the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Council in Singapore before its\r\n\r\nseparation numbered 17, of which seven  were  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia. After\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseparation   under   the  constitutional   changes\r\n\r\nembodied in the Republic of Singapore Independence\r\n\r\nAct,  1965, the Malaysian members on the Singapore\r\n\r\nCouncil ceased membership. Accordingly, the  total\r\n\r\nmembership of the Medical Council in Singapore has\r\n\r\nbeen  reduced  to 10. These are  made  up  of  the\r\n\r\nfollowing:  two  officials, two  nominees  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  Council,  and six  registered  medical\r\n\r\npractitioners  elected by the  registered  medical\r\n\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed will make for an\r\n\r\nincrease in the membership of the Medical  Council\r\n\r\nto  13. The proposed increase is to be made up  by\r\n\r\nthe   appointment  of  three  registered   medical\r\n\r\npractitioners  by  the  Minister.  This   proposed\r\n\r\nmodest   increase  will  make  the  Council   more\r\n\r\nworkable and representative and, at the same time,\r\n\r\nmore  balanced.  There will be two  officials  and\r\n\r\nthree  nominees, making a total of five  appointed\r\n\r\nmembers  against six elected medical practitioners\r\n\r\nwith  the  two members appointed by the University\r\n\r\nCouncil holding the balance in the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(6)    Housemanship:</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be aware that a medical graduate\r\n\r\ncannot    immediately   practise    medicine    on\r\n\r\ngraduation. Under the law, he has to serve for one\r\n\r\nyear  in a \"resident medical capacity\", which,  di\r\n\r\ncommon  parlance,  is  known  as  housemanship  or\r\n\r\ninternship.  In reality, this is an  extension  of\r\n\r\nhis  medical  training. It  is  an  apprenticeship\r\n\r\nwhere  a new graduate works under supervision  and\r\n\r\nin approved hospitals or units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housemanship became mandatory before a person\r\n\r\ncan  be  registered to practise  independently  in\r\n\r\n1953  when the Medical Registration Ordinance  was\r\n\r\namended and re-enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present law the new graduate must\r\n\r\nundertake  his practical training in  one  of  two\r\n\r\nspecialities,  that is, in medicine  and  surgery,\r\n\r\nduring  the  year  of  housemanship.  Training  in\r\n\r\nobstetrics  and  gynaecology  may  be  counted  as\r\n\r\neither  medicine or surgery. Thus, within the  one\r\n\r\nyear  of housemanship these medical graduates will\r\n\r\ndo six\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths in a medical or a surgical type of posting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now, however, a growing range of\r\n\r\nspecialities  in  the  medical  services.  It   is\r\n\r\nconsidered that some housemen could, with benefit,\r\n\r\nundertake  some of the training in some  of  these\r\n\r\nspecial areas. The amendments proposed will  allow\r\n\r\nfor  the  postings of housemen to these other  and\r\n\r\nnever specialities which they now cannot undertake\r\n\r\nunder the present law. This will allow for greater\r\n\r\nflexibility in the training of our housemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(7)    Annual retention fee:</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed in the amendments to introduce an\r\n\r\nannual  retention fee for registration of  medical\r\n\r\npractitioners.  The amount will be  determined  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister. However, it is envisaged that  this\r\n\r\nfee  will be a relatively nominal one and will  be\r\n\r\ncomparable  to the fees paid by other professional\r\n\r\npersons  who are registered in Singapore.  Medical\r\n\r\npractitioners are the only professionals who up to\r\n\r\ndate  do not pay an annual retention or practising\r\n\r\nfee.  This  differs  from every  other  registered\r\n\r\nprofessional persons in Singapore who have to  pay\r\n\r\nan  annual  practising fee. Thus  the  architects,\r\n\r\nlawyers and engineers pay annual fees and so  also\r\n\r\ndo  the pharmacists, dental surgeons, midwives and\r\n\r\nnurses, including assistant nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things, the major reason for\r\n\r\nintroducing the annual fee is that it  will  be  a\r\n\r\nmethod  by which an accurate and up-to-date record\r\n\r\nis kept of all medical practitioners. As it is, it\r\n\r\nis almost impossible to be sure of the reliability\r\n\r\nor  accuracy of the Register. This is because once\r\n\r\na  person is registered, he does not feel  obliged\r\n\r\nto  inform  the  Registrar of any changes  of  his\r\n\r\naddress  of  practice. Any changes at present  may\r\n\r\ncome  about  by  chance or on  the  occasion  when\r\n\r\nletters are returned undelivered to the Registrar.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an unsatisfactory state of affairs.  The\r\n\r\nannual retention fee will change all this. It will\r\n\r\nthen  be possible to keep an up-to-date record  of\r\n\r\nevery practitioner in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that there will be some rumblings\r\n\r\nabout  the imposition of this annual fee from  the\r\n\r\nmedical profession. One criticism is that  we  are\r\n\r\ntaking  away one of the last vestiges of privilege\r\n\r\nof medical practitioners. The annual retention fee\r\n\r\nhas recently been imposed in the United Kingdom  -\r\n\r\nnot without controversy - to meet the expenses  of\r\n\r\nthe  General Medical Council of the U.K., and more\r\n\r\nand more countries are adopting the same system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Sir, I wish now to turn to penalties for\r\n\r\nmisconduct.  Under the present  law,  the  Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil  has  recourse  to  only  two  methods  of\r\n\r\ndealing  with  a  practitioner when  he  is  found\r\n\r\nguilty  of misconduct. This is either (i)  to  let\r\n\r\nhim  off,  or (ii) to remove him from the register\r\n\r\nof  practitioners, in which case he  will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  practise. It is felt that there  may  be\r\n\r\ncertain  intermediate misdemeanours where  a  less\r\n\r\nsevere  penalty  than striking  off  the  Register\r\n\r\ncould  be  imposed. As it is, the Medical  Council\r\n\r\nsometimes  is not prepared to impose  the  maximum\r\n\r\npenalty of removal of the practitioner's name from\r\n\r\nthe Register because the misconduct might not have\r\n\r\nbeen serious enough for them to do so. Yet to take\r\n\r\nno  action  would  also be unjustified.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason,  the amendments proposed would  allow  for\r\n\r\nthe Medical Council to impose other penalties such\r\n\r\nas  the  issue  of warnings or suspensions  for  a\r\n\r\nperiod of not less than three months and not  more\r\n\r\nthan  one  year in those cases where  less  severe\r\n\r\npenalties are considered appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the proposed amendments in the Bill have been\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the Medical Council for their  views\r\n\r\nand  comments.  They have agreed to  some  of  the\r\n\r\namendments,  disagreed with a few and  gave  their\r\n\r\nviews and comments on others.

Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, I am very glad\r\n\r\nto hear the explanation of the Minister for Health\r\n\r\non the Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill, but\r\n\r\nmany points have been left out. Therefore, I would\r\n\r\nlike him to consider my suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule to the Bill lists the universities\r\n\r\nin    both   Commonwealth   and   non-Commonwealth\r\n\r\ncountries   whose   medical   qualifications   are\r\n\r\nrecognised  but no mention has been  made  of  the\r\n\r\nmedical  qualifications of universities or medical\r\n\r\ncolleges  of India, Pakistan and Ceylon.  This  is\r\n\r\nstrange,  for  in  the past.  Singapore  has  been\r\n\r\ngraced  by many medical practitioners who are  not\r\n\r\nonly  citizens of these countries, but also  local\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  have obtained their  qualifications\r\n\r\nfrom  these  countries. It seem&  rather  strange,\r\n\r\nbecause     the    United    Kingdom    recognises\r\n\r\nqualifications from, these universities, while  we\r\n\r\nin  the Commonwealth tend to ignore a whole sector\r\n\r\nof   the   Commonwealth  and   thereby   lose   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to take advantage of the brain  drain\r\n\r\nfrom these countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, what would be the future of the\r\n\r\npresent students who are in the advanced stage of\r\n\r\ntheir medical studies in the universities of the\r\n\r\nthree countries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Schedule to the Bill, it appears\r\n\r\nthere are some universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nwith  which we in Singapore are not very familiar.\r\n\r\nI   wonder  how  these  universities  have  gained\r\n\r\nrecognition,  whereas not a single  university  of\r\n\r\nIndia, Pakistan and Ceylon is in the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to reconsider the\r\n\r\nSchedule  to  include  a few universities  of  the\r\n\r\ncountries that I have mentioned, because there are\r\n\r\nmany  parents who are worried about the future  of\r\n\r\ntheir  sons and daughters who are already studying\r\n\r\nin the universities of these countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Sir, while I\r\n\r\nwelcome this Bill, I am a little bit curious about\r\n\r\nthe  criteria for determining the list of approved\r\n\r\nuniversities  and  colleges  as  listed   in   the\r\n\r\nSchedule.  I am no medical man, but 1  would  have\r\n\r\nthought  that the medical schools of, say, Harvard\r\n\r\nor  Stanford  or  a  number of  other  Ivy  League\r\n\r\ncolleges  in  the United States are of  sufficient\r\n\r\nstature to be included. Although the Minister does\r\n\r\nhave  discretion  under the  Bill  to  accept  any\r\n\r\napplicant for registration, students are guided by\r\n\r\nthe  Schedule  in  deciding upon  the  college  or\r\n\r\nuniversity  to go to. I hope to see some  time  in\r\n\r\nthe   future   a   more  comprehensive   list   of\r\n\r\nuniversities including those I have mentioned,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as some of the more prominent ones in India,\r\n\r\nPakistan  and Ceylon as mentioned by my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to praise the Government's\r\n\r\neffort  in  the past years to improve and  develop\r\n\r\nour  medical services. However, we often  read  in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  about  the  shortage  of  medical\r\n\r\npersonnel  in  Singapore. On  the  one  hand,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  to meet the shortage  of  medical\r\n\r\npersonnel  and,  on  the other  hand,  it  has  to\r\n\r\nmaintain   the  high  standard  of   the   medical\r\n\r\nprofession.   I  therefore  welcome   the   timely\r\n\r\nproposed  amendments  to the Medical  Registration\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nseek  clarification from the Minister for  Health.\r\n\r\nWe know that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuniversity-trained  doctors,  other   than   those\r\n\r\nlisted  in  the Schedule, have been  recruited  to\r\n\r\nfill  the  vacancies  in  the  Government  medical\r\n\r\nservice.   Among  some  of  them   are   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens. I wish to enquire whether these  doctors\r\n\r\nwho  are Singapore citizens will be allowed to  be\r\n\r\nregistered for private practice, without having to\r\n\r\ngo  through  the required examination, when  their\r\n\r\ncontracts with the Government expire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I, first of all,\r\n\r\nanswer  the  Member for Anson on the  question  of\r\n\r\nmedical  students who are at present  studying  in\r\n\r\nmedical  schools  which are not  on  the  Schedule\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have proposed. May I draw his attention\r\n\r\nto  section  9  (1)  (c) of the  Act  where  those\r\n\r\ngraduates who do not possess qualifications on the\r\n\r\napproved  list  can  apply for  registration,  and\r\n\r\ntheir registration may be approved by order of the\r\n\r\nMinister  after  he  has  consulted  the   Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil.  We have now made provision in this  Bill\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  Medical Council,  if  they  are  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the standard of the applicant,  can\r\n\r\nset  a  registration examination.  If  the  person\r\n\r\npasses  it, he will be registered. In other words,\r\n\r\nit  all depends on the personal competence of  the\r\n\r\nperson  who applies for registration. And  if,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson says, they come from medical\r\n\r\nschools of a high calibre, there is no reason  why\r\n\r\nthey  should  not be able to pass  a  registration\r\n\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa wants to know what are\r\n\r\nthe criteria we use to draw up the Schedule. As  I\r\n\r\nhave  explained in my speech, this is only a first\r\n\r\nlist  which we have drawn up,, because, as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  it is not possible at this stage to include\r\n\r\nevery  medical school in the world which we  think\r\n\r\nis   of   eminence.   We  have   just   chosen   a\r\n\r\nrepresentative few from the various countries from\r\n\r\noutside  the  Commonwealth, medical schools  whose\r\n\r\ninternational reputation and prestige no  one  can\r\n\r\ngainsay.  As  you know, the question of  standards\r\n\r\nand  reputation  can  be  subject  to  a  lot   of\r\n\r\ncontroversy and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nargument one way or the other. Further, as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, we also have provisions whereby the Minister\r\n\r\ncan  add to or delete from the list after  he  has\r\n\r\nconsulted the Medical Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru has mentioned that we\r\n\r\nare   now  short  of  doctors,  and  yet  we   are\r\n\r\nrestricting  the  number of  doctors  who  can  be\r\n\r\nregistered.  We are not restricting. In  fact,  we\r\n\r\nhave  widened  the  Schedule  to  include  medical\r\n\r\nschools  from outside the Commonwealth.  Hitherto,\r\n\r\nthe  list  was  a  GMC  list which  included  only\r\n\r\nmedical schools from within the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru also wants to know\r\n\r\nwhether   graduate  doctors  who  have   been   in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service  have to  go  through  another\r\n\r\nexamination  before  they can  be  allowed  to  do\r\n\r\nprivate practice. In a hospital, if he is a  young\r\n\r\ndoctor  he is always practising under supervision,\r\n\r\nwhereas  if  he  is  practising  outside,  he   is\r\n\r\npractising  on  his  own. So there  are  different\r\n\r\ncriteria  of  allowing a doctor to  practise.  All\r\n\r\nalong  our  criterion  of  allowing  a  doctor  to\r\n\r\npractise  on his own is that he does not  endanger\r\n\r\nthe  lives  of  his patients. If a  person  has  a\r\n\r\nmedical qualification which is not on the approved\r\n\r\nlist,  as  1 have said, he can make an application\r\n\r\nunder  section  9 (1) (c) of the Act  whereby  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Council can consider his application.  If\r\n\r\nthe Council have doubts about his competence, they\r\n\r\nwill set him a registration examination and, if he\r\n\r\npasses, he will be registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Chua Stan Chin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr N.

The principles\r\n\r\nunderlying the proposed amendments are similar  to\r\n\r\nthose  which  were made in the amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nMedical Registration Act. Accordingly, it will not\r\n\r\nbe  necessary for me to describe the amendments in\r\n\r\nsuch great detail nor to advance again the reasons\r\n\r\nwhich   were   argued  in  the   debate   on   the\r\n\r\ncorresponding    amendments   in    the    Medical\r\n\r\nRegistration (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal amendments to the Dentists\r\n\r\nRegistration Act fall into two parts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) on membership of the Dental Board; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) on registrable dental degrees and the\r\n\r\nmethod  of  registration of those who  do  not\r\n\r\npossess registrable dental degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On membership of the Dental Board: As in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the  Medical Council, the  Dental  Board\r\n\r\nsuffered a reduction in the number of its  members\r\n\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore   separated  from   Malaysia.   From   a\r\n\r\nmembership totalling 11, this was reduced to  only\r\n\r\nseven  in  1965  when the four  Malaysian  members\r\n\r\nceased membership on Singapore's separation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found in practice that the\r\n\r\nmembership of seven is rather too small  a  group.\r\n\r\nIn  order to make it more workable, the amendments\r\n\r\nproposed will increase the membership to nine.  It\r\n\r\nis  proposed  to  bring  about  this  increase  by\r\n\r\nincreasing   the   nomination  from   the   Dental\r\n\r\nAssociation  from  one  to  two  dental   surgeons\r\n\r\npractising  in Singapore, and for the Minister  to\r\n\r\nappoint  another  dental  officer  in  the  public\r\n\r\nservice  of Singapore. In this way the balance  of\r\n\r\nmembers  between those nominated by  the  Minister\r\n\r\nand those by the Association is preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted that the Dental Board consists\r\n\r\nentirely of appointed or nominated persons. Unlike\r\n\r\nthe  Medical Council there are no elected  members\r\n\r\nto  the  Board. If the composition of  the  Dental\r\n\r\nBoard  is  approved by acceptance of the  proposed\r\n\r\namendments, it will then consist of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Director of Medical Services;\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the Assistant Director of Medical Services (Dental);\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) two dental officers in the public service appointed by the Minister;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) a dental surgeon nominated by the Faculty of Dentistry;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) two dental surgeons nominated by the Singapore Dental Association;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) a registered dentist nominated by the Registered Dental Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On registrable degrees: As has been similarly\r\n\r\nproposed  for medical registration, it is proposed\r\n\r\nto  adopt  a  list  of recognised  dental  degrees\r\n\r\nwhereby persons in possession of such degrees  may\r\n\r\nbe  entitled to be registered as practising dental\r\n\r\nsurgeons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of the Dentists\r\n\r\nRegistration Act (Chapter 215\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  1970  Revised  Edition),  the  recognised\r\n\r\ndegrees  are those who hold a degree,  diploma  or\r\n\r\nlicence  in dental surgery of the King Edward  VII\r\n\r\nCollege   of   Medicine  or  the   University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as well as those dental qualifications\r\n\r\nwhich are recognised by the General Dental Council\r\n\r\nof the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained in the debate on the amendments to\r\n\r\nthe  Medical  Registration Act,  the  adoption  of\r\n\r\nsomebody  else's list of recognised qualifications\r\n\r\nnot  only has its inherent defects but is also not\r\n\r\nin   keeping  with  our  independent  status   and\r\n\r\nnational needs. Accordingly it is proposed in  the\r\n\r\namendments to follow the same device as  that  for\r\n\r\nthe Medical Registration Act, which is to adopt  a\r\n\r\nlocal  list of dental qualifications which can  be\r\n\r\nrecognised. The amendments also provide, as in the\r\n\r\ncase of the Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill,\r\n\r\nthat  this  list  can be varied  by  additions  or\r\n\r\ndeletions made from time to time by order  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister after he has consulted the Dental Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially this list of registrable dental\r\n\r\nqualifications will be the same list as  has  been\r\n\r\nadopted  by  the  General Dental  Council  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom. It will be noted that this  is  a\r\n\r\ncomparatively  shorter  list  than  the  list   of\r\n\r\nrecognised medical qualifications. There are  also\r\n\r\nno  controversial issues here by way of  additions\r\n\r\nor deletions which have to be explained, as was in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of the Medical Registration (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again as in the case of the amendments to the\r\n\r\nMedical  Registration Act, it  is  essential  that\r\n\r\nprovision be made to deal with those cases where a\r\n\r\nperson may be holding dental qualifications  which\r\n\r\nare   not   on   the   list  of  approved   dental\r\n\r\nqualifications.

The  Commission of Inquiry  submitted\r\n\r\nits  Report  in  July 1969 and recommended,  among\r\n\r\nother  things,  the development of a decentralised\r\n\r\nstatistical system under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  a  research and statistics section will  be\r\n\r\nset  up  in each of the four Ministries of Labour,\r\n\r\nHealth, Education and National Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of this decentralised system\r\n\r\nwill  enable the Ministries to develop  their  own\r\n\r\nspecial   statistics   and   the   Department   of\r\n\r\nStatistics   to  concentrate  more   on   national\r\n\r\nstatistics,  especially  population,  births   and\r\n\r\ndeaths,  external trade, balance of  payments  and\r\n\r\nnational  income. It is recognised, however,  that\r\n\r\nwithin this decentralised statistical system there\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be a central agency to co-ordinate  and\r\n\r\npromote   the   statistical  activities   of   the\r\n\r\nDepartment   of  Statistics,  the   research   and\r\n\r\nstatistics sections, and the statistical wings  of\r\n\r\nother  Ministries. It is also logical, and  indeed\r\n\r\nessential, that this co-ordination and promotional\r\n\r\nwork  should  be extended to cover the statistical\r\n\r\nactivities  of the various statutory bodies.  This\r\n\r\ncentral  agency  will  also  act  as  the  channel\r\n\r\nthrough  which  all statistical inquiries  between\r\n\r\noverseas  agencies  and  the  Republic   will   be\r\n\r\nprocessed.  Furthermore,  the  central  agency  is\r\n\r\nexpected   to   provide  expert  advice   on   the\r\n\r\ncollection,   publication   and   utilisation   of\r\n\r\nstatistics  generated  by  all  these  statistical\r\n\r\nwings  in  the  Government and  statutory  bodies,\r\n\r\nespecially  to those not provided with statistical\r\n\r\nstaff  and  facilities. Apart from building  up  a\r\n\r\ncentral   statistical   archive-cum-library,   the\r\n\r\ncentral   agency  will  be  responsible  for   co-ordinating  the in-service training of statistical\r\n\r\npersonnel  in Government and statutory  bodies  at\r\n\r\nprimary, intermediate and tertiary levels in order\r\n\r\nto  infuse  a greater sense of professionalism  in\r\n\r\ntheir work.

It  marks\r\n\r\nanother  milestone  in  the  development  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic.  We  have reached the level  where  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  quality in many areas of  organisation\r\n\r\nand expertise is increasingly felt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Statistical Commission will,\r\n\r\nhopefully,   not   only  avoid   duplication   of\r\n\r\nstatistical work by various Government Ministries\r\n\r\nand bodies but also raise standards in the use of\r\n\r\nstatistical techniques. Plans and policies can be\r\n\r\nformulated  correctly only if the empirical  data\r\n\r\nis  statistically  sound. I hope  the  Commission\r\n\r\nwill  also  provide  periodic barometers  of  the\r\n\r\nhealth of our economy and of our society. I  look\r\n\r\nforward  also  to the stage where the  Commission\r\n\r\ncan   utilise  the  research  manpower  resources\r\n\r\navailable at our institutions of higher  learning\r\n\r\nfor  long-range  in-depth  studies  relevant   to\r\n\r\npolicy making in our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The academic researcher in Singapore has long\r\n\r\nbeen  greatly hindered by the lack of statistical\r\n\r\nsources. The stamp of the word \"Confidential\"  on\r\n\r\nour  files excludes him from access to the needed\r\n\r\ndata.   The   consequence  has  been  a   serious\r\n\r\nmisallocation  of high-calibre brain  power  for,\r\n\r\nwith limited access to needed data material,  the\r\n\r\nacademic  researcher must turn to  subjects  more\r\n\r\ntheoretical and more abstract. He is then  guided\r\n\r\nmore   by  the  standards  and  the  demands   of\r\n\r\ninternational  specialisation  necessarily   very\r\n\r\nabstract  and  remote  from  relevance   to   the\r\n\r\neconomic and social needs of Singapore. So we get\r\n\r\nthe perverse situation where policy making relies\r\n\r\nupon   the  slender  research  resources   within\r\n\r\nGovernment,   while  our  academic   brains   are\r\n\r\nexercised in an ivory tower not entirely of their\r\n\r\nown making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, therefore, that the National Statistical\r\n\r\nCommission  will be able to channel our  research\r\n\r\nmanpower  resources to more relevant  uses.

Subsequently in May 1970, an Amendment  Act\r\n\r\nwas passed which removed certain restrictions  in\r\n\r\nthe principal Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of representations made by some\r\n\r\nMembers,  it  is  now  considered  equitable   to\r\n\r\npropose further amendments to the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four principal amendments are being proposed in\r\n\r\nthe present Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the amendment to section 6 of the\r\n\r\nAct.  As section 6 now stands, where a Member  of\r\n\r\nParliament  is  for  any  period  entitled  to  a\r\n\r\nsuperannuation  benefit under any provident  fund\r\n\r\nor  pension scheme outside the Act, the period of\r\n\r\nsuch contribution will only be taken into account\r\n\r\nin  calculating  the  length  of  his  qualifying\r\n\r\nservice but not for the purpose of computing  the\r\n\r\nquantum  of the pension payable to him under  the\r\n\r\nAct.  It  has been argued that this provision  is\r\n\r\ninequitable and equal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreatment should be accorded service in Parliament\r\n\r\nby  all Members whatever their entitlements  under\r\n\r\nany other scheme. It has been further argued that,\r\n\r\nas  representatives  of the people,  much  of  the\r\n\r\nM.P.s'  work  has  to be done outside  the  normal\r\n\r\noffice hours of their other employment during week-ends,  and  even during their holidays which  they\r\n\r\nsacrifice  so as to be of maximum service  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  they  serve. It  has,  therefore,  been\r\n\r\ndecided  that  section  6 of  the  Act  should  be\r\n\r\namended  to  enable  all  Members  of  Parliament,\r\n\r\nregardless  of their entitlement under  any  other\r\n\r\nsuperannuation  scheme, to take into  account  all\r\n\r\ntheir  Parliamentary service for  calculating  the\r\n\r\namount of their pensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment seeks to redefine the term\r\n\r\n\"salary\",  so that even though the holder  of  the\r\n\r\npost  of  Speaker  may not for any  period  be  an\r\n\r\nelected  Member  of Parliament, his  salary  would\r\n\r\nstill  be  taken  to  earn pension  and  gratuity.\r\n\r\nHence, a new subsection (2) is added to section  2\r\n\r\nof the principal Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment is the inclusion of a new\r\n\r\nsubsection (3) to section 2 of the principal  Act,\r\n\r\nwhich will provide for payment of full pension  or\r\n\r\nbenefit  to a Member of Parliament who voluntarily\r\n\r\nrefrains from receiving the whole or part  of  the\r\n\r\nsalary  that is due to him. As the law now stands,\r\n\r\na pension is calculated on the basis of the salary\r\n\r\nactually drawn at the time of retirement.  Members\r\n\r\nwill realise that the operation of the present law\r\n\r\nwill  be  such  that  if  a Member  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nvoluntarily refrains from receiving the  whole  or\r\n\r\npart   of   his  salary  due  to  him,   he   will\r\n\r\nautomatically  suffer a second  penalty  when  his\r\n\r\npension eventually comes to be calculated  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of his retirement.

At present, in addition\r\n\r\nto the 29 companies officially registered with the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Companies as  operating  chit  fund\r\n\r\nbusiness, there are more than a hundred unofficial\r\n\r\nchit fund companies in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chit fund is very similar to hwei and kutu\r\n\r\nwhich  are  familiar  to the  Chinese  and  Indian\r\n\r\ncommunities  respectively. In brief, a  chit  fund\r\n\r\noperates  in the following manner. Each chit  fund\r\n\r\nmember  contributes a fixed sum  of  money  for  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  fixed periods - per week or month,  as\r\n\r\nthe  case  may be. The total contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nchit  fund  amount per period will then be  pooled\r\n\r\nand auctioned among members.

The main features of the Bill are:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.<i>Control and licensing</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Commissioner of Chit Funds will be appointed,\r\n\r\nunder  clause  3, to administer  the  law  and  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  activities  of  chit  funds.  It  is\r\n\r\nenvisaged  that the functions of the  Commissioner\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken  on by the Monetary  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Chit fund operators will be required to\r\n\r\napply  for  licences, and clause  4  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  licences to  be  issued  to  public\r\n\r\ncompanies only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II. <i>Security of deposits</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to safeguard the interest of chit fund\r\n\r\nmembers,  chit fund companies will be required  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  minimum  paid-up capital of  $200,000,  a\r\n\r\nproportion  of  which  will  be  required  to   be\r\n\r\ninvested in approved assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, under clause 21 of the  Bill,  it  is\r\n\r\nrequired that an additional security will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  deposited with the Commissioner based  on  the\r\n\r\nchit fund amount. As an additional safeguard,  the\r\n\r\ntotal  amount of business that a chit fund company\r\n\r\ncan  transact  in relation to its paid-up  capital\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  regulated. This  is  contained  in\r\n\r\nclause 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These requirements are considered necessary so\r\n\r\nthat  the  chit fund companies not only will  have\r\n\r\nsufficient   working  funds  but  also   will   be\r\n\r\ncommitted to a very large extent in ensuring  that\r\n\r\ntheir business is properly and effectively run and\r\n\r\nmanaged.  While  appreciating that some  companies\r\n\r\nwill  have  difficulties in  meeting  the  capital\r\n\r\nrequirements   prescribed,  the   protection   and\r\n\r\nsafeguard  which these provide cannot be disputed.\r\n\r\nClause  62  allows  for  an  initial  transitional\r\n\r\nperiod  of some six months before compliance  with\r\n\r\nthe  Act, but if circumstances warrant, individual\r\n\r\nextensions   will   be   considered.   Ultimately,\r\n\r\nhowever,  it is our objective to see that stronger\r\n\r\nfinancial units are evolved. Companies that may be\r\n\r\nadversely  affected by these capital  requirements\r\n\r\nwould  be  well  advised either to increase  their\r\n\r\ncapital  or consider mergers and amalgamations  if\r\n\r\nthey wish to remain in business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to emphasize that due care and diligence\r\n\r\nshould  be  exercised  by  persons  managing  chit\r\n\r\nfunds,  as the money collected by them is held  in\r\n\r\ntrust for the benefit of members. This is provided\r\n\r\nunder clause 38 of the Bill, which stipulates that\r\n\r\nchit fund companies shall be liable to members for\r\n\r\nthe contributions made by members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that with the passing of this\r\n\r\nAct,  there  will  be  sufficient  protection   to\r\n\r\nmembers participating in chit funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of other provisions of the proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation   can  be  found  in  the  explanatory\r\n\r\nstatement attached to the Chit Funds Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, as far back\r\n\r\nas  January  1970, prompted by complaints  from  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  my  constituents,  I  urged  the  then\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance in this House  to  consider\r\n\r\nintroducing   suitable  legislative  measures   to\r\n\r\ncontrol the activities of chit fund companies.  It\r\n\r\nhas  taken the Government almost two years to come\r\n\r\nto  a definite decision. Whilst the careful manner\r\n\r\nin  which  the Ministry has studied the activities\r\n\r\nof  such  companies  is most  commendable,  it  is\r\n\r\nregrettable that the delay has caused a number  of\r\n\r\nour citizens, some of whom are my constituents, to\r\n\r\nlose  financially  at  the hands  of  unscrupulous\r\n\r\noperators.  However, I suppose it is  better  late\r\n\r\nthan never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the details of the Bill were published,\r\n\r\nthey  have  attracted  quite  considerable  public\r\n\r\nattention.  In  general, it  is  agreed  that  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  quite  adequate  to  protect  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  public and  also  sufficiently\r\n\r\nflexible to enable existing chit fund companies to\r\n\r\noperate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of minimum capital requirements,\r\n\r\nthere  are,  however, two schools of thought.  The\r\n\r\nBill  provides that no chit fund company shall  be\r\n\r\ngranted or shall hold a licence unless its paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital is not less than $200,000. We have in  the\r\n\r\npast   weeks  seen  in  various  newspapers  large\r\n\r\nadvertising spaces taken up by chit fund companies\r\n\r\ngiving enthusiastic support to the proposed  Bill.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, we have also read reports that\r\n\r\nsome companies are not particularly happy over the\r\n\r\nfact  that the required paid-up capital should  be\r\n\r\nmore   than  $50,000  which,  I  understand,   was\r\n\r\noriginally intended. These two opposing  reactions\r\n\r\nlead me to suspect that the $200,000 as stipulated\r\n\r\nis   perhaps  a  little  heavy  for  the   smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies  but  negligible  to  the  big  ones  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to their respective volumes in turnover.\r\n\r\nI  think it may be more equitable to all concerned\r\n\r\nif a graduating scale of required capital is to be\r\n\r\nprescribed under the Bill; starting from a minimum\r\n\r\nof, say, $100,000 to a maximum of, say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$1  million, depending upon the volume of business\r\n\r\nhandled  by  the company concerned. To the  larger\r\n\r\ncompanies,  the  maximum  of  $1  million,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  is by no means excessive if we  are  to:\r\n\r\nbear  in mind that some of these companies have  a\r\n\r\nvolume  of  business  running  into  millions   of\r\n\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, the Ministry is to be\r\n\r\ncongratulated on the comprehensive nature  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  which, if properly enforced, should  achieve\r\n\r\nthe  objective  of safeguarding  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nsubscribers.  However, I would like  to  take  the\r\n\r\nopportunity of inquiring from the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner of Chit Funds will  be  given  a\r\n\r\nteam of inspectors to carry out surprise checks on\r\n\r\nthe  books of registered companies so as to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  all aspects of the law are complied with  at\r\n\r\nall times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, it seems to me a pity that the\r\n\r\nBill makes no provision for chit fund companies to\r\n\r\ninvest  compulsorily a percentage of the funds  in\r\n\r\nhand   in   approved  forms  of  assets  such   as\r\n\r\nGovernment securities and selected counters in the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange. By so providing, it would, I feel,\r\n\r\nbe  possible  to raise the level of respectability\r\n\r\nand the economic functions of chit fund companies,\r\n\r\nin  terms  of their ability to contribute  to  our\r\n\r\nnational  economy, to the same level  as  that  of\r\n\r\nestablished institutions of national savings  such\r\n\r\nas   banks,   insurance  companies   and   finance\r\n\r\ncompanies. Whilst I agree that chit fund companies\r\n\r\nare   rendering  excellent  services  to  traders,\r\n\r\nhawkers, farmers and householders in need of short-term credit facilities for legitimate business  or\r\n\r\ndomestic  purposes, I cannot help  but  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey   are   also  financiers  of   gamblers   and\r\n\r\nspendthrifts   and   that  the  excessive   credit\r\n\r\nfacilities generated by their operations,  if  not\r\n\r\ncarefully watched and controlled, are most  likely\r\n\r\nin  the long run to contribute to the rising  cost\r\n\r\nof living and inflationary trends in our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This  sum deposited with no interest  is  a\r\n\r\nterrific  burden  on the existing small  companies\r\n\r\nwhich  may  have to close down and, as  a  result,\r\n\r\nthis  may affect the contributions of the existing\r\n\r\nsubscribers of these small companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, clause 12 of the Bill forbids the\r\n\r\nmerger  or  consolidation of chit fund  companies.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I feel that clause 9 only helps the big-time operators to monopolise the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that the minimum capital\r\n\r\nrequirement  be reduced to a more reasonable  sum,\r\n\r\nsay  $50,000  or  capital with  reference  to  the\r\n\r\ncompany's  assets, thereby allowing  the  existing\r\n\r\nsmall  companies to carry on their business.  This\r\n\r\nwill   also   give  confidence  to  the   existing\r\n\r\nsubscribers of these companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clause 7 of the Bill, I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether   the   Minister  could  include   another\r\n\r\ncondition that only Singaporeans can apply  for  a\r\n\r\nlicence  to  operate a chit fund company,  because\r\n\r\nthese  companies  are mainly run for  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand should be managed by Singaporeans only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  support  of the Chit Funds  Bill  whose\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  not only comprehensive  but  also\r\n\r\ntimely.  The  Explanatory Statement describes  the\r\n\r\npurposes of the Bill - to license and control chit\r\n\r\nfund   companies   for  the  protection   of   the\r\n\r\nsubscribers.  It  remains  to  be  seen,  however,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  ingenuity of any chit  fund  company\r\n\r\nwould  in  the course of time be able to  discover\r\n\r\nand exploit any latent loophole in the Bill to its\r\n\r\nown   advantage   and  at  the  expense   of   the\r\n\r\nsubscribers. The possibility of the perversion  of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobjectives of the Bill is not so farfetched as one\r\n\r\nwould  imagine when one considers the  example  of\r\n\r\nthe  Moneylenders Act which has been designed  for\r\n\r\nthe  protection  of the borrower,  but  which  has\r\n\r\npractically   strengthened  the  stranglehold   of\r\n\r\nmoneylenders  on  their  unfortunate  victims.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore   seek   clarification  regarding   some\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 (1) of the Bill stipulates that the\r\n\r\nminimum  capital  requirement for  any  chit  fund\r\n\r\ncompany to be accorded a licence shall be not less\r\n\r\nthan  $200,000. Such a minimum limit seems  to  be\r\n\r\nfairly  substantial  enough to  afford  a  certain\r\n\r\namount  of  protection to the subscribers  of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies.  But  in  reality  the  protection   so\r\n\r\nafforded is more apparent than real, depending  on\r\n\r\nthe   scale   of  operations  of  the  chit   fund\r\n\r\ncompanies. A chit fund scheme with 100 subscribers\r\n\r\neach  contributing  $l0 weekly  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nrealise a total chit fund amount of $100,000  over\r\n\r\na  period of approximately two years. At five  per\r\n\r\ncent of the chit fund value, the commission of the\r\n\r\ncompany in respect of this particular scheme alone\r\n\r\nwill be $5,000. It does not require much effort to\r\n\r\ncalculate that if a chit fund company operates  40\r\n\r\nsuch schemes or a smaller number of schemes with a\r\n\r\ntotal  chit  fund value equivalent to $4  million,\r\n\r\nthe  commission of the company will  be  not  less\r\n\r\nthan $200,000. I am, therefore, happy to note that\r\n\r\nclause   61(1)  (g)  of  the  Bill  empowers   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner,  with the approval of the  Minister,\r\n\r\nto  make regulations to prescribe the total  value\r\n\r\nof  chit funds to be conducted at any one time  by\r\n\r\nthe chit fund companies in relation to their paid-up capital. It is obvious from the illustration  I\r\n\r\nhave  just given that the minimum sum of  $200,000\r\n\r\nmay  be  practically sufficient for the protection\r\n\r\nof  contributors in every given instance. There is\r\n\r\na  need for the regulations envisaged under clause\r\n\r\n61,  and I hope that they will come into operation\r\n\r\nwithin  the shortest time possible of the  passing\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 (4) of the Bill provides that no right\r\n\r\nor  claim  under  any scheme or arrangement  which\r\n\r\nonly partakes of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnature  of a chit fund within the meaning  of  this\r\n\r\nAct  or  regulations made thereunder shall, without\r\n\r\nprejudice  to the provisions of clause 20  (1),  be\r\n\r\nenforceable by action in any court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 (1) states that every scheme or\r\n\r\narrangement  which is not based  on  the  essential\r\n\r\nterms  and  conditions set out in clause 24  shall,\r\n\r\nfor  the  purposes of the Bill, be deemed  only  to\r\n\r\npartake   of  the  nature  of  a  chit  fund.   The\r\n\r\ncumulative effect of these two provisions and other\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill, as I see it, is to penalise\r\n\r\nequally  the  culpable promoter  and  the  innocent\r\n\r\nsubscriber  of a chit fund. Though there  are  four\r\n\r\nofficial  languages in the Republic, it is  nowhere\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the  Bill that every  agreement  made\r\n\r\nunder clause 23 containing the terms and conditions\r\n\r\nset  out under clause 24 should be written in  more\r\n\r\nthan one official language. I suppose that literacy\r\n\r\nor  proficiency in only one language in our  multi-racial   republic  is  a  misfortune  and   not   a\r\n\r\nprivilege;  and that a subscriber to  a  chit  fund\r\n\r\nwhose agreement is written in the official language\r\n\r\nhe cannot comprehend, must run the risk of being so\r\n\r\ndeficient. All the same, it seems inequitable  that\r\n\r\nthe innocent subscriber, after being hoodwinked  by\r\n\r\na  chit  fund operator who has fraudulently omitted\r\n\r\nsome   of   the  essential  terms  and   conditions\r\n\r\nprescribed under clause 24 in respect of  any  chit\r\n\r\nfund  and  thereby caused it to be deemed  only  to\r\n\r\npartake  of  the nature of a chit fund,  should  be\r\n\r\ndebarred  from having any recourse to  a  court  of\r\n\r\nlaw.  Such  a  subscriber  apparently  cannot,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, apply to the court for an order directing\r\n\r\npayment  by other subscribers under clause  40  (2)\r\n\r\n(b), in the event of the termination of a chit fund\r\n\r\nor  the  failure of a chit fund operator to conduct\r\n\r\nthe chit fund in accordance with the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe   proposed  Bill.  It  would  hardly   be   any\r\n\r\nconsolation  to a subscriber for the  loss  of  his\r\n\r\nmoney  invested in a chit fund that the  chit  fund\r\n\r\noperator and his agents are subsequently prosecuted\r\n\r\nfor  the fraudulent or improper conduct of the chit\r\n\r\nfund.  I  am sure it is not the intention  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse that any chit fund promoter or subscriber  is\r\n\r\nto be permitted to suggest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsteps  in making not enforceable by action in court\r\n\r\nthe rights of claim of a subscriber as provided for\r\n\r\nunder  clause 24. A distinction should be  made  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  whether a subscriber has knowingly  and\r\n\r\nwilfully been a party to the failure of a chit fund\r\n\r\nto  comply  with the essential terms and conditions\r\n\r\nset  out in clause 24. The whole text of clause  24\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  an  elimination  of  any  scope  for\r\n\r\nfraudulent  practices by, for instance,  apparently\r\n\r\nlimiting a subscriber to one share per chit fund as\r\n\r\ninferred  from paragraphs (b) and (1) of clause  24\r\n\r\n(1).  There  is  apparently no restriction  on  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  chit  funds in which a  subscriber  can\r\n\r\nsimultaneously participate. It is,  of  course,  in\r\n\r\nthe  general interest of every subscriber to a chit\r\n\r\nfund  that  he can freely invest in the chit  fund.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, apart from what I have earlier said in\r\n\r\nrelation to clause 24, there seems to be a distinct\r\n\r\nneed  for  a  bona fide subscriber to be  protected\r\n\r\nfrom  his fellow subscribers whose financial credit\r\n\r\nmay  be suspect or who may be colluding with a chit\r\n\r\nfund operator. Clause 30, for instance, requires  a\r\n\r\nsubscriber  to  produce  at  least  two  guarantors\r\n\r\nbefore  he  can claim payment of the prize  amount.\r\n\r\nThere  is  apparently no prohibition  against  such\r\n\r\nsubscribers  mutually agreeing among themselves  to\r\n\r\nbe  guarantors for one another. Thus, by  means  of\r\n\r\nsuch a mutual agreement, three subscribers can each\r\n\r\nclaim  payment  of the prize amount in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthree  chit funds even simultaneously. It is highly\r\n\r\nprobable  that  a reputable chit fund  company  may\r\n\r\nhave ruled in accordance with clause 24 (2) (d)  to\r\n\r\nprevent   a   subscriber  from  being  a  guarantor\r\n\r\nsimultaneously.  Moreover, under clause  61(2)  (e)\r\n\r\nthe  Commissioner  may, with the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  prescribe by regulations the  nature  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  to be given to the chit fund  company  by\r\n\r\nthe   subscriber   purchasing   a   prize   amount.\r\n\r\nNonetheless  it is rather alarming to me  that  the\r\n\r\nproposed   Bill   should   provide   a   ready-made\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  dubious  and  shady   chit   fund\r\n\r\noperators  and  subscribers to make  hay  with  the\r\n\r\nmoney  of bona fide subscribers. Rather than  leave\r\n\r\nit  to  the discretion and good business  sense  of\r\n\r\nchit fund\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperators, it may be advisable to include  in  the\r\n\r\nproposed  Bill  or the regulations  thereunder,  a\r\n\r\nprovision   requiring   guarantors   not   to   be\r\n\r\nsubscribers  who have purchased chit  fund  prizes\r\n\r\nthemselves  and who have not completed payment  of\r\n\r\ncontributions in respect thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, the provisions of the\r\n\r\nproposed Bill are as comprehensive as can be. Even\r\n\r\nthough  I  find it necessary to seek clarification\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister regarding some provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill,  I  have no doubt that bona fide subscribers\r\n\r\nrequire  the  protection that the  Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nconfer on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Sir, the main intent of this\r\n\r\nBill  is  salutary  and  I  welcome  it  for   the\r\n\r\nprotection  of the small investor. However,  I  am\r\n\r\nwondering  whether it is not too comprehensive  in\r\n\r\nembracing  the  so-called  hwei  or  tontine.  The\r\n\r\nfunction of the tontine, usually run on a  village\r\n\r\nlevel or among friends and relatives, is basically\r\n\r\nto make consumption loans available for festivals,\r\n\r\nwedding ceremonies or for educational purposes.  I\r\n\r\nthink the present Bill, by institutionalising  the\r\n\r\nsystem,  may  penalise  the small  subscriber  who\r\n\r\ncannot    readily   produce   the   two   required\r\n\r\nguarantors,   or   who  may  be   precluded   from\r\n\r\nmembership   because   he  is   not   sufficiently\r\n\r\ncreditworthy. Perhaps the Minister might  want  to\r\n\r\nconsider exempting tontines with operations  below\r\n\r\na prescribed number of subscribers or sum of money\r\n\r\nfrom the provisions of this Bill. I would not like\r\n\r\nto  see financial options foreclosed to low income\r\n\r\npeople  if  they fail to meet modern institutional\r\n\r\nrequirements.  At  the  village  level  or   among\r\n\r\nrelatives   and  friends,  social  penalties   are\r\n\r\nusually  enough  to  deter  tontine  operators  or\r\n\r\nsubscribers from embezzlement of funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I am pleased to hear the views\r\n\r\nof  Members  on the Chit Funds Bill.  The  subject\r\n\r\nmatter  is one which has created a lot of interest\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas   highlighted  the  difficulties   which   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance  has been  faced  with.  The\r\n\r\nreason why it has taken some time to prepare  this\r\n\r\nBill  is that we were not quite sure whether  chit\r\n\r\nfund   companies  should  be  legislated   against\r\n\r\naltogether  or to be legislated for in the  manner\r\n\r\nin  which  we have done so. The comments which  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  from  Members  show  the  variety  of\r\n\r\nopinions on the: operation of chit funds,  ranging\r\n\r\nfrom  the  suggestion  that  perhaps  the  capital\r\n\r\nrequirements are not sufficient to the  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  we  should allow tontine or hwei to  operate\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is necessary for easy capital  to  be\r\n\r\nobtained  in  the  rural  areas.  Our  problem  in\r\n\r\ndevising  the Bill was to fix a minimum sum  which\r\n\r\nwe   thought  would  safeguard  the  interest   of\r\n\r\nsubscribers to the hwei or tontine or kutu or chit\r\n\r\nfund.  Finally, we fixed $200,000 as  the  minimum\r\n\r\ncapital  requirement. This is as much a matter  of\r\n\r\njudgment as any other sum. We did in fact consider\r\n\r\n$50,000  as  has  been suggested  by  one  of  the\r\n\r\nMembers. We also considered whether we should  not\r\n\r\nlegislate on the operation of chit funds  at  all.\r\n\r\nCertain countries have decided that perhaps it  is\r\n\r\nbest  not  to  legislate at all. The  present  law\r\n\r\nregards  the tontine as illegal and the number  of\r\n\r\npeople who have absconded with the pool from  very\r\n\r\nnaive and innocent subscribers is quite well known\r\n\r\nto  all Members. Finally we decided on the form in\r\n\r\nwhich  this Bill was to be drafted. While I cannot\r\n\r\nclaim that this is a perfect Bill, it has at least\r\n\r\ndevised  a  scheme which I think is  workable  and\r\n\r\nwhich  we will be prepared to revise in the  light\r\n\r\nof future experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has suggested that\r\n\r\nthere should be a graduated scale from $100,000 to\r\n\r\n$1 million, depending on the size of the chit fund\r\n\r\noperations. In fact, there is already  some  basis\r\n\r\nfor  varying requirements. Apart from the $200,000\r\n\r\ndeposit, there are provisions for a limitation  in\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of  the operations  and  for  further\r\n\r\nsecurity to be given to the Commissioner. We  have\r\n\r\nnot  put in any specific sum in the Bill, but this\r\n\r\nwill be determined in the light of experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also suggested that we require a\r\n\r\nteam  of  inspectors and hopes that they  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided  to administer the Act. I can assure  him\r\n\r\nthat, as we have legislated for administration  of\r\n\r\nchit  funds, it is our intention that the Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority of Singapore, whom I have said  will  be\r\n\r\nasked  to  administer the Act, will  be  furnished\r\n\r\nwith the necessary inspectorate to administer it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also pointed out that there is no\r\n\r\nprovision  for  chit  fund  companies  to   invest\r\n\r\ncompulsorily. We have suggested that part of their\r\n\r\ndeposits should be invested in local assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also referred to the\r\n\r\ndeposit of $200,000. I have already answered  this\r\n\r\nearlier.  He  thought the Act would help  the  big\r\n\r\noperators  but  would  weigh heavily  against  the\r\n\r\nsmall  operators  and  suggested  $50,000  as  the\r\n\r\nminimum  deposit. He also suggested  that  perhaps\r\n\r\nthe   licences   should   be   issued   only    to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans. In issuing licenses,  we  will  give\r\n\r\nsome weight to the character of the applicant, and\r\n\r\nif  he  is  obviously not permanently attached  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it  is  possible  to  provide  in  the\r\n\r\nlicence   that   certain  conditions   should   be\r\n\r\nfulfilled. This is a matter which we will consider\r\n\r\nas we go along in the administration of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been suggested that the agreement\r\n\r\nbetween  the chit fund company and its subscribers\r\n\r\nshould be in several languages. There is no reason\r\n\r\nwhy  chit  fund operators should not use different\r\n\r\nlanguages in explaining the operation of the  chit\r\n\r\nfund  to  their subscribers. I am sure that  those\r\n\r\nwith  business sense will find it useful. It would\r\n\r\nbe  advantageous to have explanations in different\r\n\r\nlanguages. But even in conveyancing of  wills  and\r\n\r\nproperty and so on, the English language  is  used\r\n\r\nand perhaps it is convenient that there should  be\r\n\r\nonly  one  legal and official version of the  chit\r\n\r\nfund agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Member has made a number of suggestions\r\n\r\nwhich  I  think will be very useful,  and  I  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  consider them when  this  Bill  becomes\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most of the points made\r\n\r\nby Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr N.

Such powers are now\r\n\r\nvested with the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy, Sir, to begin with the amendment\r\n\r\nto  section  4.  As the law stands at  present,  a\r\n\r\nperson found guilty of assisting in carrying on  a\r\n\r\npublic  lottery  and  all other  related  offences\r\n\r\nshall be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000  or\r\n\r\nto  imprisonment  for a term not  exceeding  three\r\n\r\nyears,  or to both such fine and imprisonment.  It\r\n\r\nis felt that this punishment is grossly inadequate\r\n\r\nto  assist the police in their efforts t) suppress\r\n\r\nthe  operation of illegal lotteries in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  commonest  forms of which are  the  so-called\r\n\r\n\"10,000  Characters Lottery\" and the  \"Chap-Ji-Kee\r\n\r\nLottery\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lotteries are persistent in Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  police  have found it extremely difficult  to\r\n\r\neradicate them. Running public lotteries  is  very\r\n\r\nprofitable.  They  are  so profitable  that  their\r\n\r\npromoters  are  not  deterred  by  fines   imposed\r\n\r\npresently.  Experience has shown  that  the  fines\r\n\r\nimposed  on  offenders  have varied  substantially\r\n\r\nfrom  court  to court, and in some instances  they\r\n\r\nhave  been  so  low  as to be  unrealistic.  These\r\n\r\nvariations   in  fines  have  not   in   any   way\r\n\r\ncontributed towards eradication and suppression of\r\n\r\nthese  lotteries. At present the maximum  fine  of\r\n\r\n$6,000 is \"chicken feed\" to the big-time promoters\r\n\r\nand hardly serves as a deterrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that invariably\r\n\r\npromoters pay the fines imposed on the runners and\r\n\r\ncollectors,  and it is very rare  that  anyone  is\r\n\r\nimprisoned  for  non-payment of a fine.  With  the\r\n\r\nraising  of  the  minimum fine to $2,000  and  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  fine to $20,000, the promoters will  find\r\n\r\nit  difficult to sustain payment of fines, as  the\r\n\r\nrunning  of  these  lotteries  would  become  less\r\n\r\nlucrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite some statistics to drive home this\r\n\r\npoint.   First,  the  statistics   on   raids   on\r\n\r\n\"Characters  Lottery\". During the  years  1966  to\r\n\r\n1970 the police\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconducted  3,077 raids. A total of  1,399  persons\r\n\r\nwere   arrested,  of  whom  1,165   persons   were\r\n\r\nconvicted.  The  total fines for  all  these  five\r\n\r\nyears amounted to $479,315. In the last year alone\r\n\r\nthere   were   659   raids,   303   arrests,   214\r\n\r\nconvictions, with a total fine of $146,595.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite the statistics on the raids on \"Chap-Ji-Kee Lottery\". During the same period, that is\r\n\r\nto say, from 1966 to 1970, there were 2,116 raids.\r\n\r\nA total of\r\n\r\n1,007 persons were arrested, of whom only 831 were\r\n\r\nconvicted.  The  total  fine  amounted   to   only\r\n\r\n$391,277. The fines imposed were very low indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite the fines imposed on persons who\r\n\r\nwere  convicted  of running \"Characters  Lottery\".\r\n\r\nDuring  the  years  1966 to 1970,  the  fines  per\r\n\r\nperson ranged from only $295 to $685. For the same\r\n\r\nperiod,  the  fines imposed on  people  caught  in\r\n\r\nrunning \"Chap-Ji-Kee Lottery\" ranged from $291  to\r\n\r\n$686.  These fines were very low indeed. The fines\r\n\r\nimposed, as may be gathered from the statistics  I\r\n\r\nhave  cited, were negligible. More often than not,\r\n\r\nthey  were paid by the promoters. Taking the  1970\r\n\r\nconvictions   in   respect  of   the   \"Characters\r\n\r\nLottery\",  if  a minimum fine of $2,000  had  been\r\n\r\nimposed, the fines would have totalled nearly half\r\n\r\na  million dollars as against the figure of  about\r\n\r\n$147,000.  This would have adversely affected  the\r\n\r\nprofitability of running these lotteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the law does not provide for a\r\n\r\nminimum fine, and the discretion to impose such  a\r\n\r\n\"minimum  fine\" is left to the discretion  of  the\r\n\r\nMagistrate who, more often than not, is left in  a\r\n\r\nquandary.  The  fines are normally  based  on  the\r\n\r\nvalue   of   documents   seized.   This   is    an\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory method as, in some instances,  big-time  operators have got away lightly as the value\r\n\r\nof documents seized has been negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the police have managed to exercise a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount  of control over  these  types  of\r\n\r\noffences,  the amendment would be an added  weapon\r\n\r\nto them in their fight against this social problem\r\n\r\nwhich   affects  every  level  of   our   society,\r\n\r\nparticularly the lower income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroups  who fritter away their earnings to bet  on\r\n\r\nthese  illegal  lotteries. The amendment  of  this\r\n\r\nparticular section will also bring it in line with\r\n\r\nthe  punishment  provided  for  book-makers  under\r\n\r\nsection  5 (3) (a) of the Betting Act (Chapter  95 of the 1970 Edition) which provides a minimum fine\r\n\r\nof $2,000 and a maximum of $20,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the amendment of section\r\n\r\n10.  With  the  amendment  of  subsection  (2)  of\r\n\r\nsection  10  of the principal Act by deleting  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"not below the rank of Sergeant\"  appearing\r\n\r\ntherein,  provision is sought to  allow  competent\r\n\r\npolice  officers  irrespective  of  rank  to  give\r\n\r\nevidence  on  documents pertaining to  any  public\r\n\r\nlottery  that are produced before the  courts.  At\r\n\r\npresent,  the  law  stipulates that  the  evidence\r\n\r\ngiven by a police officer of and above the rank of\r\n\r\nSergeant  competent  to be a  \"gaming  expert\"  is\r\n\r\naccepted.  This has resulted in the  inability  of\r\n\r\nthe   Gambling  Suppression  Branch   to   provide\r\n\r\nsufficient  \"experts\" to meet  the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Force. The Branch is only staffed  with  an\r\n\r\nO.C., one inspector, one detective staff sergeant,\r\n\r\none  detective sergeant, three detective corporals\r\n\r\nand 14 detectives. The expert is not only required\r\n\r\nto  give  \"expert evidence\" in court but  is  also\r\n\r\nrequired  to examine all documents seized  by  the\r\n\r\nGambling  Suppression Branch  and  the  Divisional\r\n\r\nPolice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are police officers in the\r\n\r\nGambling  Branch who would make competent  \"gaming\r\n\r\nexperts\" if not for their being below the rank  of\r\n\r\nSergeant.  The  amendment would greatly  alleviate\r\n\r\nthe   existing   difficulties  in  obtaining   the\r\n\r\nservices  of  competent  and  experienced   police\r\n\r\nofficers  in giving evidence on documents produced\r\n\r\nbefore the courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with reference to the new section 13A, the\r\n\r\npowers  sought  by this amendment  to  the  Common\r\n\r\nGaming Houses Act (Chapter 96 of the 1970 Edition)\r\n\r\nare  similar to those accorded to the police under\r\n\r\nsection 13 of the Betting Act (Chapter 95  of  the 1970 Edition). The amendment will remedy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  present  defect  in the Act  which  does  not\r\n\r\nempower a police officer to search a person who is\r\n\r\nreasonably  suspected of being  in  possession  of\r\n\r\ninstruments  or appliances for gaming,  without  a\r\n\r\nwarrant,  although there may be very good  grounds\r\n\r\nfor  believing  that  the  delay  in  obtaining  a\r\n\r\nwarrant  may result in the escape of the offender,\r\n\r\nor  the  disposal of the instruments or appliances\r\n\r\nin   question.  This  amendment,  therefore,  will\r\n\r\ngreatly   strengthen  the  hand  of  the   police,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  their efforts  to  curb  illegal\r\n\r\nlotteries. The present legal requirement to obtain\r\n\r\na  search  warrant  to make a physical  search  of\r\n\r\nanyone  reasonably  suspected  of  committing   an\r\n\r\noffence  under  the  Act is  not  practical.  This\r\n\r\nfrustrates immediate police action and enables the\r\n\r\noffender  to escape the law in good time before  a\r\n\r\nwarrant could be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me proceed to the repeal and re-enactment of section 23. This re-enactment seeks\r\n\r\nto  transfer the power from the President  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to exempt organisations referred  to  in\r\n\r\nthe amendment from the provisions of the Act. This\r\n\r\nis purely for administrative convenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Prof. Wong Lin Ken].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CLEAN AIR BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg  to  move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last decade, the rapid industrialisation\r\n\r\nin   Singapore   has   brought  economic   growth,\r\n\r\nemployment   and  affluence.  It   has,   however,\r\n\r\ntogether  with urbanisation and population  growth\r\n\r\nalso  brought  problems of  pollution  of  various\r\n\r\nkinds,   of   solid  waste  disposal,   of   human\r\n\r\nsettlement, of traffic congestion and so on  which\r\n\r\ncan   be  detrimental  to  our  environment.   Our\r\n\r\nGovernment  is determined that these problems  are\r\n\r\ncontained   and  that  the  economic  development,\r\n\r\nurbanisation and population growth will not create\r\n\r\nan  environment which is not conducive to  healthy\r\n\r\nliving.  To do this, the Government has introduced\r\n\r\na  series  of  legislation to prevent and  control\r\n\r\npollution  of various kinds. It must be remembered\r\n\r\nthat  we occupy 225 square miles of densely built-up  populated areas with no rural hinterland to go\r\n\r\nto.  We rank the highest in population density  in\r\n\r\nthe world. It is, therefore, vital not only in the\r\n\r\nshort  run but also in the long run that we should\r\n\r\nwaste no efforts in conserving our environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government started to monitor the air\r\n\r\nlast  year,  it  is found that the  level  of  air\r\n\r\npollution  has shown trends of increase.  In  some\r\n\r\nparts  of the island the level has already reached\r\n\r\nambient  air  quality standards set  up  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries. Besides the general increase in ambient\r\n\r\nair  pollution, there have been many instances  of\r\n\r\nlocal  air pollution problems caused by industrial\r\n\r\nand trade operations. This affects the comfort and\r\n\r\nwell-being  of  the people living  next  to  these\r\n\r\nsources  of  air  pollution.  The  negligent   and\r\n\r\nirresponsible attitude taken by the  occupiers  of\r\n\r\nthese premises has often been the cause of the air\r\n\r\npollution. This can be controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clean Air Bill, 1971 is yet another in the\r\n\r\nseries   of   legislation  to  ensure   that   our\r\n\r\nenvironment  is healthy and pleasant to  live  in.\r\n\r\nThe   Bill  seeks  to  prevent  and  control   air\r\n\r\npollution. It must be remembered that air  is  one\r\n\r\nof the essential commodities for the sustenance of\r\n\r\nlife.  We can live without food for many days  and\r\n\r\nwe  can live without water for a few days, but  we\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlive  without  air for only a few minutes.  It  is\r\n\r\nthus  of  the utmost importance that  the  air  we\r\n\r\nbreathe is clean and not polluted with impurities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air pollution is the presence in the air of\r\n\r\nconcentrations  of  particulate  matters,   fumes,\r\n\r\nsmoke, and many other chemicals at levels that are\r\n\r\naesthetically displeasing or physically harmful to\r\n\r\nman  and  his  environment. It  is  principally  a\r\n\r\nproblem in the highly urbanised industrial cities.\r\n\r\nThe  causes of air pollution are many. One of  the\r\n\r\nmain  causes is the incomplete burning  of  fuels,\r\n\r\nsuch  as oil and wood wastes, in boilers, furnaces\r\n\r\nand  incinerators. It is also caused by combustion\r\n\r\nprocesses  in motor cars, aeroplanes  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nChemical  processing,  food processing  and  other\r\n\r\nindustrial  premises  like  steel  works,   cement\r\n\r\nworks,  cement  factories  and  so  on  can   emit\r\n\r\npollutants   of  various  kinds  and  in   various\r\n\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us have read or heard about smog in\r\n\r\nLondon,   New   York,  Tokyo  and   other   highly\r\n\r\nindustrialised urban centres in the world and  the\r\n\r\naftermath of such occurrences. The ill effects  of\r\n\r\nair pollution on human beings are numerous, and to\r\n\r\nname a few, they are impairment of general health,\r\n\r\nirritation  of  the eyes and throat,  and  chronic\r\n\r\nbronchitis, especially in elderly people.  It  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  claimed to cause respiratory diseases.\r\n\r\nAir  pollution also reduces visibility, spoils the\r\n\r\nview, and denies the enjoyment of the delights and\r\n\r\nbeauty of nature. It can also cause economic  loss\r\n\r\nthrough  high maintenance costs and loss  in  man-hours,  and  can also contribute to  the  physical\r\n\r\ndeterioration  of  the cities. It  has  also  been\r\n\r\nclaimed to affect vegetation and cause damages  to\r\n\r\ncrops and livestock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still at an early stage of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   compared   to   industrialised\r\n\r\ncities  in the developed countries. If we  are  to\r\n\r\nlearn  from  the experiences of these  cities,  we\r\n\r\nmust  make a start now to control and prevent  air\r\n\r\npollution. Industrialists, factory owners, and the\r\n\r\npublic   must   accept   the   collective   social\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to keep our air clean.  Negligence\r\n\r\nnow may lead to such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeterioration later that remedies become extremely\r\n\r\nexpensive to introduce. Legislation is required to\r\n\r\nprevent this negligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to begin with, industrial and trade\r\n\r\nconcerns  should so conduct their operations  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  not  cause air  pollution.  Existing\r\n\r\nindustrial  and  trade  premises  may  find   some\r\n\r\ndifficulties in installing preventive and  control\r\n\r\nmeasures  and  may, therefore, be  given  adequate\r\n\r\ntime  to  do this. This is only fair as when  such\r\n\r\npremises were established there was no legislation\r\n\r\nto insist on control measures. Their profit may be\r\n\r\ncut  slightly, but this is a social responsibility\r\n\r\nthey  must  accept. We are at a stage of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment when we can be more selective  in  the\r\n\r\ntypes   of  industries  we  want  to  have.  Dirty\r\n\r\nindustries may add to the social cost of pollution\r\n\r\nmore  than  the economic benefits they can  bring.\r\n\r\nThese  types of industries will be rejected unless\r\n\r\nthey  are  prepared  to install expensive  control\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Clean Air Bill, 1971, seeks to make\r\n\r\nprovision for the prevention and reduction of  air\r\n\r\npollution   arising  from  industrial   or   trade\r\n\r\npremises  and such other premises as the  Minister\r\n\r\nmay   specify.  The  term  \"industrial  or   trade\r\n\r\npremises\"  has been defined to mean premises  used\r\n\r\nfor  any  industrial or trade purposes or premises\r\n\r\non  which  matter is burnt in connection with  any\r\n\r\nindustrial  or  trade process,  and  includes  the\r\n\r\ncategory   of   scheduled   premises.   \"Scheduled\r\n\r\npremises\"  are premises which have been  specified\r\n\r\nin  the  Schedule  to the Bill. Premises  of  this\r\n\r\ncategory,  because of their type of industrial  or\r\n\r\ntrade  activities, are considered to have  a  high\r\n\r\npotential  of  air  pollution,  and  include  such\r\n\r\npremises  as ceramic works, chemical works,  metal\r\n\r\nworks and petroleum works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will highlight some of the more important\r\n\r\nfeatures of this Bill. The administration  of  the\r\n\r\nClean  Air Act will he vested in an officer to  be\r\n\r\nstyled  the Director of Air Pollution Control  who\r\n\r\nwill be assisted by other authorised officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of Part II of the Bill will\r\n\r\napply to the category called \"scheduled premises\".\r\n\r\nClause  4  provides that no person shall,  without\r\n\r\nthe  written  permission of the  Director  of  Air\r\n\r\nPollution  Control, occupy or use any premises  as\r\n\r\nscheduled    premises.   In    considering    such\r\n\r\napplication, the Director may grant permission and\r\n\r\nalso specify certain conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 further elaborates on the requirements\r\n\r\nand conditions that may be imposed by the Director\r\n\r\nwhen  granting such permission. Scheduled premises\r\n\r\nin  existence, prior to the coming into  operation\r\n\r\nof  the Act, are exempted from having to apply for\r\n\r\nsuch   permission  although  they  still  may   be\r\n\r\nrequired  by  the  Director to  take  measures  to\r\n\r\ncontrol or reduce emissions of air pollutants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 prohibits the occupier of any scheduled\r\n\r\npremises from doing certain alterations or changes\r\n\r\nin  the  premises  or trade or industrial  process\r\n\r\nwithout obtaining the permission of the Director.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of Part III of the Bill will\r\n\r\napply  to  industrial and trade premises generally\r\n\r\nincluding scheduled premises. Clause 8 imposes the\r\n\r\nresponsibility on occupiers of any  industrial  or\r\n\r\ntrade   premises  to  maintain  any   fuel-burning\r\n\r\nequipment or any control equipment installed in or\r\n\r\non  the premises in an efficient condition and  to\r\n\r\noperate the same in a proper and efficient manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 prohibits industrial and trade premises\r\n\r\nfrom  emitting dark smoke from the chimney subject\r\n\r\nto  certain  exceptions to be  prescribed  by  the\r\n\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 prohibits the occupier of any\r\n\r\nindustrial  or trade premises from conducting  any\r\n\r\ntrade  or industrial process or operate any  fuel-burning  equipment or industrial plant in  such  a\r\n\r\nmanner as to emit air impurities in excess of  the\r\n\r\nprescribed standards. The occupier is to  use  the\r\n\r\nbest  practical  means  necessary  to  prevent  or\r\n\r\nminimise air pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 empowers the Director to require the\r\n\r\noccupier  of any such premises to take  preventive\r\n\r\nor control measures in respect of air pollution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 empowers the Minister to extend the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this part of the Bill to such  other\r\n\r\nclass or description of premises as he may specify\r\n\r\nby order in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals with various\r\n\r\nprovisions;  they  are,  inter  alia,  powers   of\r\n\r\nenforcement  of the Director and other  authorised\r\n\r\nofficers, disclosure of information, furnishing of\r\n\r\ninformation, powers of entry, service  of  notices\r\n\r\nand penalties for offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 empowers the Minister to prohibit the\r\n\r\nuse  of such combustible materials or fuel-burning\r\n\r\nequipment  or industrial plant as may be specified\r\n\r\nby the Minister by an Order in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 empowers the Minister to direct the\r\n\r\noccupier of any industrial or trade premises  from\r\n\r\nconducting  any  trade  or industrial  process  or\r\n\r\noperating any fuel-burning equipment or industrial\r\n\r\nplant  where  the emission of air impurities  from\r\n\r\nsuch  premises is or is likely to be injurious  to\r\n\r\npublic health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 contains provisions for any aggrieved\r\n\r\nparty  to  appeal  to  the  Minister  against  any\r\n\r\ndecision of the Director.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 would empower the Minister in his\r\n\r\ndiscretion to exempt the occupier of any trade  or\r\n\r\nindustrial  premises  from  all  or  any  of   the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 25 empowers the Minister to make\r\n\r\nrules  for  prescribing certain matters  that  are\r\n\r\nnecessary for the administration of this Act  and,\r\n\r\nin particular, the prescribing of standards, tests\r\n\r\nand types of control equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that this Bill does, not deal\r\n\r\nwith  air  pollution caused by the  exhausts  from\r\n\r\nmotor vehicles. This aspect is already being dealt\r\n\r\nwith  in other Ordinances and is best left out  of\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of this Bill.
