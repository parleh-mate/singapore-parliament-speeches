I  have  the  following\r\n\r\nquestions  to  ask:   (1)  What are the  training  programmes\r\n\r\nsupported\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  Fund?  (2) What are the objective and focus  of  the\r\n\r\nfund  in  training  workers?  (3)  In  view  of  the  current\r\n\r\nunemployment  situation, will the  Fund  focus  more  on  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of retrenched workers, ie, older and lower-educated\r\n\r\nworkers?   (4)  Would NTUC publish a profile of  workers  who\r\n\r\nhave  benefited from the fund so far, in terms of their  age,\r\n\r\neducation level, job position and income?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Member has asked questions on what the NTUC\r\n\r\nEducation and Training Fund is used for, how is it being used\r\n\r\nto help workers and what kind of training programmes.  Let me\r\n\r\nexplain that the NTUC Education and Training Fund, which  was\r\n\r\nfirst set up in October 1998, is used to support workers  who\r\n\r\nare not getting training support from their employers.  So it\r\n\r\nis  an  individually motivated skills upgrading and  training\r\n\r\nprogramme.   When  a  person  is  already  employed  and  his\r\n\r\nemployer  wants to send him for training, they  can  use  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment  Programme  directly.   We  have   very\r\n\r\ngenerous  grants for employer-supported skills upgrading  and\r\n\r\nretraining.   But  there  are of course  some  workers  whose\r\n\r\nemployers are not so far-sighted and who do not want to  send\r\n\r\ntheir workers for training.  In which case, there is a danger\r\n\r\nthat these workers may be left out of all these opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  skills upgrading.  This is where the NTUC Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining  Fund  comes  in to fill up  this  gap  and  provide\r\n\r\nanother  safety  net for workers, especially  those  who  are\r\n\r\nlower-skilled and, in fact, older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this Education and Training Fund is especially for\r\n\r\nthese workers who want to go for training or skills upgrading\r\n\r\non their own.  Generally, the types of courses that NTUC will\r\n\r\nsupport  are similar to the courses that are available  under\r\n\r\nthe  Skills  Redevelopment Programme.  These are  courses  or\r\n\r\ntraining  that would help workers to acquire skills that  are\r\n\r\nneeded  for either the manufacturing sector or service sector\r\n\r\nand is quite broad based, and it covers many industries.   It\r\n\r\nis a fairly long list.  I think there are about 100-odd\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  courses  available  and  we  are  in  the  process   of\r\n\r\ncontinuing  to increase the type of courses, or  enlarge  the\r\n\r\nlist  of  training courses, that can be supported  under  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme and, therefore, also supported\r\n\r\nby NTUC under the Education and Training Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the NTUC Education and Training Fund is an\r\n\r\nendowment  fund,  the money that is being collected  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's subvention to NTUC are not spent directly.  They\r\n\r\nform part of the endowment fund and its interest returns  are\r\n\r\nbeing  used to support the workers who want to go for  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.  In this way, we can continue to ensure that  NTUC\r\n\r\nwill  have a flow of interest returns from the endowment fund\r\n\r\nto continue its support for workers who need this assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already touched on the objectives. It is to help\r\n\r\nprepare  workers so that they can acquire the skill  that  is\r\n\r\nneeded for them to seek re-employment.  The labour market has\r\n\r\nturned bad.  We are now facing a serious crisis.  As DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nhas mentioned on Friday in great detail, I would not have  to\r\n\r\ngo  over  it  again.   We are facing a major  downturn.   The\r\n\r\nemployment  market will continue to be very, very  difficult.\r\n\r\nMore workers are going to be retrenched and for those who are\r\n\r\nretrenched,  they  are  going to have greater  difficulty  in\r\n\r\nfinding  new jobs.  In this environment, the worker  who  has\r\n\r\ngot  higher skills and is willing to acquire new skills  will\r\n\r\nstand a better chance in getting re-employed, compared to one\r\n\r\nwho  is lower skilled and not willing to make an effort.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, retraining or skills upgrading does not mean that  he\r\n\r\nwill automatically get a new job because the whole job market\r\n\r\nhas  shrunk.  So it is going to be very competitive.   It  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be very difficult as many people are chasing  after\r\n\r\nso few jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all things being equal, if a worker is not prepared\r\n\r\nto  make  this effort to upgrade his skills, or  acquire  new\r\n\r\nskills,  that means, go for retraining, then his  chances  of\r\n\r\ngetting  a  new job are going to be worse off than the  other\r\n\r\nguy who is making every effort to upgrade his skills\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  is  very  ready to pick up new skills,  learn  something\r\n\r\ndifferent, or do a different job.  Hence, all our programmes,\r\n\r\nincluding those under NTUC Education and Training Fund, focus\r\n\r\non  this aspect of preparing and helping our workers so  that\r\n\r\nthey can cope with this changed environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question about whether the fund will support\r\n\r\nretrenched  and lower-educated older workers, the  answer  is\r\n\r\n\"yes\".   That  is  the  focus.  Similar to  the  Government's\r\n\r\ntraining  programmes,  the focus of the  NTUC  Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining  Fund  is on the group of workers most  in  need  of\r\n\r\nhelp.  So they turn out to be that these are the older, lower-skilled workers.  And this is what we will continue to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the profile, I would convey his request to NTUC. At\r\n\r\nthe appropriate time, I am sure NTUC will be willing to share\r\n\r\nits  experience and the profile of the union members who have\r\n\r\nbenefited from this programme with Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to know whether those\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  union  members, and their  employers  are  not\r\n\r\nsupportive  of  their training requests, could  benefit  from\r\n\r\nthis  fund.  If not, where can they get help from?  The other\r\n\r\nquestion is perhaps not so related to this cut, and I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether the Minister is prepared to answer, is  whether\r\n\r\nthe new increased grants for workers who undergo for training\r\n\r\nprogramme announced would be subject to some abuse.   Workers\r\n\r\nmay  take the grant of $1,000 or $2,000 during this situation\r\n\r\nto go for training but they may not get the job at the end of\r\n\r\nthe day.  Could the Minister clarify the point?  Although the\r\n\r\nDPM  announced  that  the grant for those  workers  who  need\r\n\r\ntraining during the downturn would be increased, the question\r\n\r\nis  whether or not you will find employers for these  workers\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are retrenched, and link them up and provide  the\r\n\r\ntraining,  or  you  actually allow them to  go  for  training\r\n\r\nwithout any employers.  And will there be workers who keep on\r\n\r\ngoing for training but they can never get a job at the end of\r\n\r\nthe day?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member asked\r\n\r\nwhether those who are non-union members can also benefit from\r\n\r\nthis  training assistance.  The answer is yes.  If  they  are\r\n\r\nunion  members, of course, and if they are union members  who\r\n\r\nare   employed,  they  can  take  advantage  of  the   Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme as an employer-supported training.  I\r\n\r\nhad  mentioned that earlier.  If they are union  members  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  unemployed, they can go to NTUC and  seek  support\r\n\r\nfrom the Education and Training Fund.  For those who are non-union members, whether they are unemployed or their employers\r\n\r\nare  not  prepared to support them for skills  upgrading,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  third  avenue to assist them.  This is  through  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  self-help  groups, ie, SINDA,  MENDAKI  and  CDAC.\r\n\r\nThese  community self-help groups will play the part  of  the\r\n\r\n\"surrogate\"  employers.   They  will  become  the  sponsoring\r\n\r\nagency  for  the unemployed worker, or for the  worker  whose\r\n\r\nemployer  is  not  prepared to send him for  training.   They\r\n\r\nwould then put up a proposal to send this worker for training\r\n\r\nand  the  Government  will  give him  support  and  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  through the community self-help group.   We  have\r\n\r\nalready quite a number of people who were trained under  this\r\n\r\ncommunity  self-help group route.  As of  October  2001,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  workers who were supported under the  \"surrogate\"\r\n\r\nemployer group, ie, the community self-help groups, is  about\r\n\r\n7,800  workers.   They  also  receive  financial  subsidy  or\r\n\r\ntraining fee subsidy to achieve skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his second point is whether we will help those who\r\n\r\nare  undergoing  training  to  find  new  jobs,  instead   of\r\n\r\nremaining just on a permanent long-term training.  Yes,  that\r\n\r\nis the focus of our programmes.  We will certainly make every\r\n\r\neffort  to  try to job-match those who have undergone  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading or taken up retraining and place them in  new  jobs\r\n\r\nthat  are  still  available.  We will make  every  effort  to\r\n\r\nensure that those who sign up for skills upgrading will  have\r\n\r\na chance to be re-employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, a further clarification. If,\r\n\r\nlet  us  say, a worker is retrenched, he has yet to  find  an\r\n\r\nemployer  and he has approached the Ministry for  help,  what\r\n\r\nwould be the process and arrangement for that worker?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> If an unemployed Singaporean or a\r\n\r\nretrenched  worker comes to my Ministry and  says,  \"Look,  I\r\n\r\nneed help\", my officers at Career Link@MOM, which is our main\r\n\r\nservice centre for helping unemployed Singaporeans, will  try\r\n\r\nto find out more about his working background, experience and\r\n\r\nskills level.  Then we will try to identify which would be  a\r\n\r\nsuitable sector that he should direct his job search  efforts\r\n\r\nat.   And  where  we find that he has inadequate  skills  for\r\n\r\nparticular  job  vacancies, we will then try to  structure  a\r\n\r\nsuitable training programme for him.  If he does not have the\r\n\r\nright  kind of skills, we will try to arrange for him to  get\r\n\r\nthis  training.  If he is unemployed, of course he  does  not\r\n\r\nhave  an employer to sponsor him, then we will recommend that\r\n\r\nhe  either goes to NTUC to seek help under the Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining  Fund  or  goes to one of the appropriate  community\r\n\r\nself-help groups to seek assistance, with the self-help group\r\n\r\nacting as a surrogate employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will try to do everything possible to help this\r\n\r\nperson, including providing him with a training package  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  suitable  for his particular  background,  because\r\n\r\ndifferent people may come with different kinds of background.\r\n\r\nSome  have  more skills, some have less, including even  some\r\n\r\nexecutives and middle management people, for whom maybe it is\r\n\r\nnot just a question of training but opening up the job search\r\n\r\nto look at more different kinds of industry or business where\r\n\r\nhe could perhaps look for alternative work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will do everything possible. In some cases, we\r\n\r\neven  do  counselling on a one-to-one basis,  to  help  these\r\n\r\nunemployed Singaporeans to acquire a more pro-active  mindset\r\n\r\nin looking for jobs.  There are things like job-search skills\r\n\r\nwhich  some  people may not have - how do  you  prepare  your\r\n\r\ncurriculum vitae\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  you  are  sending  out a resume,  how  do  you  present\r\n\r\nyourself at interviews.  Some of these things, eg, if you  do\r\n\r\nnot  present  yourself properly during  this  downturn,  when\r\n\r\nemployers  really have such a wide range to choose from,  you\r\n\r\nwould not get picked.  So some of these job-search skills, we\r\n\r\nalso  try  to  impart.  We run little workshop  sessions  for\r\n\r\npeople  who  register with us in our employment register,  we\r\n\r\nbring  them  in and conduct little seminars to help  them  to\r\n\r\nimprove job-search skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, would you like to withdraw your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> One more question, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to know what is\r\n\r\nthe  response time of the Ministry from the time an  approach\r\n\r\nis  made  by a worker to the time of referral.  Is there  any\r\n\r\ntimeframe  set  for the Ministry to conduct that?   Does  the\r\n\r\nMinistry follow up after the worker has been referred for job\r\n\r\nmatching, because I understand that some workers, after being\r\n\r\nreferred, go to the employers and the employers say they have\r\n\r\nenough people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, during this downturn, the number\r\n\r\nof  people  coming to my Ministry has gone up  by  leaps  and\r\n\r\nbounds.   On the other hand, the number of jobs available  in\r\n\r\nthe  job  bank  has  also declined, as part  of  the  overall\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn.  So job matching will  obviously  take  a\r\n\r\nlonger  time than what we used to be able to do.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nhave a specific timeframe to find a match, but we will try as\r\n\r\nsoon  as a person registers with us, maybe within a few days,\r\n\r\nto  give  him some recommendations of job openings  that  are\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to closing the feedback loop, it works both ways. We\r\n\r\nalso need the job seekers to come back to us and tell us  the\r\n\r\noutcome.  Quite often, people go for interviews, if they  get\r\n\r\nthe  job or even if they do not get the job, they just do not\r\n\r\ncome  back  to  us.  Or, sometimes, after having  recommended\r\n\r\nseveral job opportunities\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  a job seeker, he may or may not go for an interview.   He\r\n\r\nmay  have found another job on his own, because people do not\r\n\r\njust look for jobs through our Career Link@MOM service.  They\r\n\r\nare  also actively looking for jobs through their own network\r\n\r\nof friends, making enquiries, what is available, what are the\r\n\r\njobs  they have, etc.  So MOM offers only one of the  contact\r\n\r\npoints for them in terms of job search.  Sometimes, when they\r\n\r\nfind jobs through other avenues, they do not come back to us.\r\n\r\nSo  we  cannot completely close the feedback loop  for  every\r\n\r\ncase  that  comes  to our attention.  We cannot  give  him  a\r\n\r\ndefinitive   answer  in  that  sense,  partly   because   the\r\n\r\nregistrants themselves do not help us to close that loop.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $15,000,000 for Head T ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof   the  Supplementary  Estimates  of  Expenditure  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year 1st April, 2001 to 31st March, 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Z -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head Z, Ministry of Finance.

I think it  is\r\n\r\nonly  fair that the detailed scheme should be made  known  in\r\n\r\nthis  House before the Estimate is passed.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. How many shares will each individual be allocated,\r\n\r\nand what is the basis of the allocation of the shares?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Are the shares allocated linked to political support\r\n\r\nfor the PAP?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. How much would the cash benefit of the shares be per\r\n\r\nindividual when they are first redeemed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. What is the Government's projection of the cash\r\n\r\nvalue of the shares at their maturity in 2007?  Assuming that\r\n\r\na  person  keeps his share till then, how much  cash  benefit\r\n\r\nwill he get?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move to my second cut on assistance to needy\r\n\r\nfamilies.  Sir, I understand that $200 million is needed  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  contribution to the  Community  Assistance\r\n\r\nFund, and I suppose these are contributions to CDCs and other\r\n\r\norganisations.  I would like to know:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. How this $200 million will be allocated. If it is\r\n\r\nto CDCs, how much will each CDC get, and how much Hougang CDC\r\n\r\nwill be allocated and what is the basis of the allocation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Since the fund was intended to assist needy\r\n\r\nfamilies, what mechanism is there in place to make sure  that\r\n\r\nCDCs use the fund for its intended purpose?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What are the specific programmes mandated by the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the CDCs to carry out to achieve the objective\r\n\r\nof the allocation under the Budget?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\non the first question asked, on the adequacy of the notice, I\r\n\r\nthink the Standing Order requirements have been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmet.

This is  not\r\n\r\nmy responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on the New Singapore Shares - how\r\n\r\nmany shares will be allocated - and Mr Low also wants to know\r\n\r\nwhy  Parliament is asked to approve the sum of money  without\r\n\r\ndetails  being  known.  I can only suggest  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\ngiveaway scheme.  Where money is being given, unless you  are\r\n\r\nobjecting to the principle of giving New Singapore Shares  to\r\n\r\ncitizens, I do not see how this question is relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how many shares will be given, this will be\r\n\r\nannounced  by  me at the Ministry of Finance  tomorrow  at  a\r\n\r\npress conference at 9.00 am, in which all the details will be\r\n\r\nreleased.   The principle is to allocate qualifying  citizens\r\n\r\nwith New Singapore Shares amounting to between 200 shares per\r\n\r\nindividual, up to 1,700 shares per individual.  Those who are\r\n\r\nin  the  lower  income groups and elderly  persons  will  get\r\n\r\nsomewhat more shares; those who have served National  Service\r\n\r\nwill get more shares.   Of course, the lower sum of $200 will\r\n\r\napply to those who are in the higher income groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give Mr Low a categorical assurance that there is\r\n\r\nno  political link.  All residents who qualify within Hougang\r\n\r\nconstituency will receive their fair share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the value of these shares in the year 2007, I\r\n\r\ncannot  give  him a fixed figure because it  depends  on  the\r\n\r\nbasic interest rate, which is fixed at 3% per year, plus  the\r\n\r\nreal  GDP  growth rate of the preceding year.  So, I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  the  GDP growth rates will be in the  year  2002,\r\n\r\n2003,  etc.  But it will certainly be more than the principal\r\n\r\nsum, plus 3% per annum.  At the end of the 5-year period, any\r\n\r\nperson  who has not cashed in any of the shares will get  the\r\n\r\nfull principal plus the interest accumulated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question of the $200 million, it is the\r\n\r\nmoney  given to the Community Assistance Fund (CAF).  Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain what the Community Assistance Fund is.  The Community\r\n\r\nAssistance  Fund was formed by the pooling of two  charitable\r\n\r\nfunds, ie, the 25th Anniversary Endowment Fund and the Silver\r\n\r\nJubilee  Fund in the year 2000.  The CAF funds the  following\r\n\r\nfinancial  schemes:   special  grants;  rents  and  utilities\r\n\r\nassistance  scheme,  interim  financial  assistance  schemes,\r\n\r\ncentre-based  financial assistance schemes  for  back-to-work\r\n\r\nchildcare  schemes,  and other approved voluntary  programmes\r\n\r\nfor  low  income individuals.  These schemes are administered\r\n\r\nby  the  Community Development Councils which act as one-stop\r\n\r\nagencies  to  administer  social  assistance.   A  Board   of\r\n\r\nTrustees  appointed by the Ministry of Community  Development\r\n\r\nand  Sports decides on the allocation policies and budget for\r\n\r\nthe  financial  assistance  expenditures.   A  committee   of\r\n\r\nmanagement   headed   by  the  People's   Association,   with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from all CDCs and National Council of  Social\r\n\r\nServices,  allocates  the budget to each  CDC  and  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAF's principal currently stands at $43 million,\r\n\r\nplus  the $200 million grant, which is the subject of today's\r\n\r\napproval.  The principal sum will be invested by professional\r\n\r\nfund  managers  to generate an annual income of approximately\r\n\r\n$5   million  to  fund  all  these  financial  schemes.   The\r\n\r\nrequirement for the CAF will be reviewed in 2005.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir.

Like all\r\n\r\nother members of the United Nations, we are legally bound  by\r\n\r\nthe  UN Charter to implement mandatory resolutions of the  UN\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council.  A failure to give effect to the  measures\r\n\r\nmandated  by  the Security Council would be a breach  of  our\r\n\r\ninternational obligations for which Singapore may be  subject\r\n\r\nto censure and sanctions by the Security Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good illustration is the recent United Nations\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council Resolution 1373 adopted on  28th  September\r\n\r\n2001  which  was after the terrorist attacks  in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  on  September 11th.  It calls upon member  States  to\r\n\r\nimplement  a  series of measures against  terrorism  and  the\r\n\r\nfinancing  of  terrorism.   This  resolution,  passed   under\r\n\r\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter, is binding on  all\r\n\r\nmember  States.   It calls for international  cooperation  to\r\n\r\ncombat threats to international peace and security caused  by\r\n\r\nterrorist  attacks and provides for the imposition of  strict\r\n\r\nnew  measures  to  criminalise and prevent the  financing  of\r\n\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the approach we have hitherto taken has been to\r\n\r\nimplement mandatory UN Security Council resolutions through a\r\n\r\nvariety  of existing legislative and administrative measures.\r\n\r\nWhere  we  have  not  been able to give  effect  to  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil resolutions through existing laws, we have sought  to\r\n\r\namend   specific  legislation.   For  example,   last   year,\r\n\r\nParliament  amended the Monetary Authority of Singapore  Act,\r\n\r\nthe  Air Navigation Act and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal\r\n\r\nMatters  Act  to enable Singapore to be better able  to  give\r\n\r\neffect to our various treaty obligations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can implement most of the requirements of the recent\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  Resolution 1373 under our  existing  laws.\r\n\r\nHowever,   given  its  unique  scope  and  breadth   of   the\r\n\r\nresolution,  there  are some aspects of the  resolution  that\r\n\r\ncannot be met under our existing laws.  For example, there is\r\n\r\na requirement that member states shall:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Criminalise the wilful provision or collection, by any\r\n\r\nmeans, directly or indirectly, of funds by their nationals or\r\n\r\nin their territories with the intention that the funds should\r\n\r\nbe  used,  or in the knowledge that they are to be  used,  in\r\n\r\norder to carry out terrorist acts;\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,  our existing laws do not criminalise the  provision\r\n\r\nor   collection  of  funds  by  Singapore  citizens   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  criminal or terrorist acts committed  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to consider the possibility that there may\r\n\r\nbe  future  UN  Security  Council resolutions  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nterrorism or other pressing international crimes.   We  would\r\n\r\nnot be able to anticipate or predict the breadth and depth of\r\n\r\nthese  possible  future resolutions.   Nonetheless,  we  must\r\n\r\nensure that we are in a position to be able to give effect to\r\n\r\nthem effectively and promptly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is therefore necessary to ensure that our laws\r\n\r\nare  adequate and to overcome any possible lacuna that  would\r\n\r\nprevent    Singapore   from   effectively   fulfilling    our\r\n\r\ninternational   obligations.   This  Act  will   enable   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to pass such regulations necessary to give  effect\r\n\r\nto the decisions of the UN Security Council.  It will avoid a\r\n\r\nsituation where gaps in our laws prevent us from implementing\r\n\r\nthe UN Security Council resolutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that countries such as the United Kingdom,\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand, Canada and India (amongst others) already  have\r\n\r\nin place facilitating legislation, mostly broadly similar, to\r\n\r\nallow speedy implementation of Security Council decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to speak in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UN is the most important international organisation\r\n\r\ntoday, specifically for a small country like Singapore.  Yet,\r\n\r\nthere is no world government.  In this sense, there is always\r\n\r\na  tension  between what each country must do to  fulfil  its\r\n\r\ninternational obligations and what each country  must  do  on\r\n\r\nthe basis of the sovereignty of its own people as represented\r\n\r\nin Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Sir, the UN Security Council has powers under\r\n\r\nChapter  VII  to  make laws and to bind governments,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister has said.  This is particularly under Article 41  of\r\n\r\nthe  UN Charter, read together with Article 48.  In the past,\r\n\r\nthis  has not been of much use because each permanent  member\r\n\r\nof  the Security Council can exercise a veto and, during  the\r\n\r\nCold  War,  the  disagreements  among  these  permanent  five\r\n\r\nmembers  led to a very few resolutions being binding  on  the\r\n\r\ngovernments of the world.  But since the end of the Cold War,\r\n\r\nthere  has been much more agreement among the permanent  five\r\n\r\nand  many  more Chapter VII resolutions have been called  for\r\n\r\nand  this  is likely to increase further in the wake  of  the\r\n\r\n11th September events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often good that the nations of the world can act\r\n\r\nin  concert.  There are, however, other cases in which  there\r\n\r\nmay be some cause for concern.  While the general approach of\r\n\r\nthe present Bill is correct, I think these questions must  be\r\n\r\nraised in the minds of people.  The first question is whether\r\n\r\nSingaporean laws will be overridden.  The Bill provides  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  be.  However, it also provides an assurance,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat constitutional protection continues.  This is reassuring\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans, that is to say, that while we will  follow\r\n\r\nthe  UN  Security  Council  directions,  we  will  still   be\r\n\r\nprotected by the Singapore Constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, another question as to whether this\r\n\r\nBill,  when  given  effect, would be  through  the  Singapore\r\n\r\npolice or other officials.  This is because clause 2(1)(b) of\r\n\r\nthe Bill provides that the Government or the Minister might\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nempower  whichever people they desire.  If I could just  read\r\n\r\nthat  relevant  clause.   This would  allow  \"empowering  any\r\n\r\nperson  or  class of persons to exercise, when  investigating\r\n\r\nany   offence   under  this  Act  or  any  regulations   made\r\n\r\nthereunder,  all  or any of the powers of  a  police  officer\r\n\r\nunder  the  Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) in relation  to\r\n\r\nseizable  offences.\"  In this sense, I would ask the Minister\r\n\r\nif   he  would  envisage  that  non-Singaporeans,  non-police\r\n\r\nofficers  or  other  persons would be used  to  effect  these\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three smaller questions. First, while I\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  the UN Security Council  has  the  power  to\r\n\r\ncompel  all states, including small states such as Singapore,\r\n\r\nto  follow its resolutions, there must be some thought  given\r\n\r\nto the need to consult affected states. Singapore has, in the\r\n\r\npast, talked about UN Security Council reform and brought  up\r\n\r\nthe  point  about the need to consult smaller  states  before\r\n\r\nthey  are  effected.   I would like the  Minister  to  answer\r\n\r\nwhether  this would continue to be our stand or whether  now,\r\n\r\nwe  will  simply  accept  whatever the  UN  Security  Council\r\n\r\ndecides  upon.   I ask this question in the context  of  some\r\n\r\nsanctions and other moves which in the long term have come to\r\n\r\nbe  questioned by such a community.  These, for example,  are\r\n\r\nthe sanctions on Iraq that, in some views, have persisted for\r\n\r\ntoo long a time and affected many of the Iraqi people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I would like to ask is on the\r\n\r\nprocess of how we do this.  As the Minister noted, in  almost\r\n\r\nall  cases up to now, we have amended the laws on a  case  by\r\n\r\ncase basis. This requires that the laws would have to come to\r\n\r\nParliament to be approved or disapproved.  This is consistent\r\n\r\nwith  what is called the dualist theory of international law,\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  say, that while international law may  say  one\r\n\r\nthing,   it  is  not  binding  in  Singapore  until   it   is\r\n\r\nincorporated through our national laws.  And this  keeps  the\r\n\r\nprimary  focal  point on our Parliament as a  sovereign  law-making  body.  However, Sir, in this present Bill,  I  notice\r\n\r\nthat it will basically short-cut\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament.  It will delegate to the Executive the  decisions\r\n\r\non how to implement UN Security Council resolutions.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, in some ways, that these resolutions may come  at\r\n\r\nsuch  a pace and with such urgency that there may not be time\r\n\r\nto  consider a Bill fully in Parliament.  I wish to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  there  will  be  some  time  for   another\r\n\r\nmechanism,  perhaps a consultation with a  smaller  group  of\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament, like the GPC for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that I do acknowledge the need for\r\n\r\nSingapore law to be consistent with international law, and  I\r\n\r\ngenerally  support this Bill.  However, I wish  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  consider that the UN Security Council resolutions  are\r\n\r\nonly  one aspect of keeping our national laws consistent with\r\n\r\ninternational  obligations.  And I must, in that  sense,  ask\r\n\r\nwhat is our approach to other treaties and laws that bind us.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Singapore has ratified the Genocide Convention,\r\n\r\nbut  this  has not been fully incorporated into our  national\r\n\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise in support of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just have a few comments. This Bill could have, on\r\n\r\nreflection, been introduced earlier perhaps.  There have been\r\n\r\nmany  acts of terrorism in this world.  Over the years, since\r\n\r\nSingapore  became  independent and a  member  of  the  United\r\n\r\nNations,  were  there not earlier resolutions in  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  relating  to acts of terrorism  or  related  matters\r\n\r\nwhere  Singapore had been a participant in the  debates,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  could have adopted the resolutions  that  were\r\n\r\npassed  in  the  United Nations, as in the  present  form  of\r\n\r\nlegislation in Singapore?  If not, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister why this has not been done.  Also, how  active\r\n\r\nhas  been the Singapore Representative to the United Nations,\r\n\r\nin terms of promoting resolutions to prevent terrorism?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to raise is whether, in the\r\n\r\ncourse of the debates in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe United Nations  -  and I am sure there must have been   - the  definition of \"terrorism\" was debated and defined.   And\r\n\r\nif there was a proper definition of \"terrorism\", whether that\r\n\r\ncould be incorporated into our local legislation, so that  we\r\n\r\nknow exactly what \"terrorism\" means.  A simple definition  of\r\n\r\n\"terrorism\"  could  be  one  who terrorises,  a  nation  that\r\n\r\nterrorises or a group that terrorises.  So it could be a very\r\n\r\nwide  definition.   Perhaps a form  of  definition  would  be\r\n\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a sense, it could be argued that this Bill is\r\n\r\nbeing introduced rather urgently because the United States of\r\n\r\nAmerica,  a  giant,  is  involved.  The  September  11,  2001\r\n\r\ntragedy has been responsible, in a sense, for us to introduce\r\n\r\nthis  Bill in Parliament.  Whilst all of us are very sad  and\r\n\r\nsympathetic to the families whose dear ones have passed  away\r\n\r\nduring this incident and others who are affected adversely by\r\n\r\nthis  tragedy, we, as parliamentarians, must be  seen  to  be\r\n\r\nlegislating local laws based on consistent principles.  And I\r\n\r\nwould submit that our UN Representative should be more active\r\n\r\nin this regard, not because of the September 11 incident, but\r\n\r\nany incident relating to such matters affecting terrorism  in\r\n\r\nother parts of the world too, and not just the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a financial provision in the Bill. I\r\n\r\nwould  like to seek clarification on this.  I am not sure  of\r\n\r\nthe  exact impact of it.  Would the provision in the  Banking\r\n\r\nAct  on  banking  secrecy  be involved  when  this  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation  is enacted?  In terms of banking secrecy,  there\r\n\r\nis  the  secrecy  not  to  divulge any  form  of  information\r\n\r\nrelating  to bank accounts.  Would the authorities  now  have\r\n\r\nthe  powers to investigate and look into the aspect of  where\r\n\r\nfinances  have been banked into or transferred  to,  so  that\r\n\r\nacts  of  terrorism are not just a physical act, but to  find\r\n\r\nout where the  finances have come  from and are going to,  so\r\n\r\nthat  terrorism could be minimised in Singapore,  the  region\r\n\r\nand the world at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I would support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank the Members who have\r\n\r\nspoken and I will now respond to their specific comments.

Let me\r\n\r\nassure  him  that clause 2(b) is not intended and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ndoes  not  empower non-Singaporean law officials to  exercise\r\n\r\npowers  of  investigation for offences under the  regulations\r\n\r\nwhich  may  be made under the Bill.  This power is restricted\r\n\r\nto   giving  powers  of  investigations  to  persons   within\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It does not have extra-territorial scope,  either\r\n\r\nfor  non-Singaporean officials to exercise jurisdiction  here\r\n\r\nor   for  Singaporeans  to  exercise  jurisdiction  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, offences under the Bill will be\r\n\r\ninvestigated  by  the Police.  However, we  can  conceive  of\r\n\r\nsituations  where  it may be necessary to  confer  powers  of\r\n\r\ninvestigations  on  other  persons.   They  may  be   customs\r\n\r\nofficials,   immigration  officials  or  commercial   affairs\r\n\r\nofficers.   These  officers, of course,  do  have  powers  of\r\n\r\ninvestigation with respect to the Acts under which they  have\r\n\r\nbeen   appointed.   But  if  not  for  this  Bill   and   the\r\n\r\nregulations,  they may not have powers of investigations  for\r\n\r\noffences under the proposed Bill.  That is why we have clause\r\n\r\n2(b) of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also asked about the process in the UN\r\n\r\nSecurity Council, the role of smaller states and so on.  Yes,\r\n\r\nit  is  true that the permanent five, in reality, are key  to\r\n\r\nmost of the decisions of the UN Security Council.  But if  he\r\n\r\nis asking whether Singapore and other small states do have  a\r\n\r\nrole  and  whether  they are consulted in  the  process,  the\r\n\r\nanswer  to that is yes, they have a role.  It depends on  the\r\n\r\nkind of ideas and constructive suggestions they bring to bear\r\n\r\non  either  the principle being discussed, in the details  of\r\n\r\nthe  implementation, or on procedural matters.  We  have,  in\r\n\r\nthe UN, a very hardworking team of officers led by our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPermanent Representative, and I think they are doing  a  very\r\n\r\ngood job in representing Singapore's interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we ask for consultation, it is not because we are a\r\n\r\nsmall  state.  The consultation would be useful for  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat  whatever decisions that the Security Council takes have\r\n\r\nas  broad-based  a support of the UN membership  and  of  the\r\n\r\ninternational community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third point is that the structure of the Bill is\r\n\r\nthat  of an enabling legislation and most of the details will\r\n\r\nhave  to be implemented through regulations, and whether this\r\n\r\nsomehow  undermines the sovereignty of Parliament.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure him that this is not so.  When  we  come  to\r\n\r\nquestions  of  implementing UN Security Council  resolutions,\r\n\r\nparticularly  of the nature of Resolution 1373,  often  speed\r\n\r\nand timeliness is of the essence.  And as he knows, since  he\r\n\r\nhas  taught international law, the inadequacy of domestic law\r\n\r\ncannot  be  an  excuse  for failure to perform  international\r\n\r\nobligations.   Therefore,  because  of  the  breadth  of  the\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council's resolutions and because  we  expect  many\r\n\r\nfollow-up  of the Security Council, which will require  other\r\n\r\nmeasures  to be taken effectively and promptly by UN members,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  anticipate  that  there  will  always  be  timely\r\n\r\noccasion  to  come to Parliament to pass legislation  through\r\n\r\nFirst Reading, Second Reading and Third Reading.  So this  is\r\n\r\nthe reason why we have to structure the Bill as it is and, as\r\n\r\nI  have  mentioned in my main speech, in fact,  this  is  the\r\n\r\napproach  taken by most countries whose legislation  we  have\r\n\r\nsurveyed.  And I guess they too realise the need for  speedy,\r\n\r\neffective and prompt implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me also say that, in a sense, this\r\n\r\nlegislation  is  unusual in that it  is  regulation  to  give\r\n\r\neffect to the UN Security Council resolutions, but it is  not\r\n\r\nunusual  in the sense that in our body of laws, we have  many\r\n\r\nexamples  where   domestic  legislation  has  empowered   the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  be able to make regulations and rules  to  give\r\n\r\neffect to the basic norms set out in the parent legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked, following his first premise, whether we\r\n\r\ncould  consult  a  small group of Members of  Parliament.   I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is not really practical in order to be  able  to\r\n\r\ngive  effect  to the purposes for which we are enacting  this\r\n\r\nlegislation.  Let me take the example of UN Resolution  1373.\r\n\r\nOne  of  the provisions asks for almost effective  action  to\r\n\r\narrest  and take other measures with regard to terrorists  on\r\n\r\nthe  list or organisations under the Executive Order  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  which, in a sense, has been adopted  by  the\r\n\r\nSecurity Council's Committee under Resolution 1333.  When the\r\n\r\nUN  Security  Council does that, it is not a question  of  us\r\n\r\nhaving  to  consult  with the GPC and  so  on.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nimplement  it  immediately.  So, in that sense,  we  have  no\r\n\r\nchoice.    Otherwise,  we  are  in  default  of  UN  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil's resolutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Member will understand that this is an\r\n\r\nobligation  on Singapore and all other members of the  United\r\n\r\nNations.  And if we were to tell the Secretary-General or the\r\n\r\nChairman  of whichever sanctions committee that we are  going\r\n\r\nto  hold it up, and we are not going to arrest, or we are not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  take other necessary actions, because we  have  to\r\n\r\nconsult  the GPC  -  without  any disrespect to  the  GPC   - then  we may have a situation of having failed to do what  we\r\n\r\nmust  do.   So  it is not in any way undermining  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.  The fact that we have come to Parliament to  get\r\n\r\nthis authorisation is, in fact, in keeping with the principle\r\n\r\nof  getting  parliamentary approval, as many other  countries\r\n\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also raised the issue of the Genocide Convention.\r\n\r\nHis point is that apart from this legislation, have we looked\r\n\r\nat  other obligations we may have in the United Nations,  and\r\n\r\nhave  we ensured that our domestic laws are adequate to  give\r\n\r\neffect.  Let me assure him that we always examine this  issue\r\n\r\ncarefully.  In other words, if we are committing ourselves to\r\n\r\nan   international  obligation,  such  as   conventions   and\r\n\r\ntreaties, have we got our domestic legislation adequately  in\r\n\r\nplace  to  be  able  to  give  effect  to  our  international\r\n\r\nobligations?  So, as a general answer, let me assure him that\r\n\r\nit is so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, about the Genocide Convention, I can only\r\n\r\nrepeat  what I said at the last occasion when, I believe,  it\r\n\r\nwas  he  who also raised this point.  We were advised by  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General's  Chambers  that  there  was  no  mandatory\r\n\r\nobligation  to  enact express enabling legislation  and  that\r\n\r\nmost,  if  not  all, of the requirements under  the  Genocide\r\n\r\nConvention  could  be done through existing  legislation  and\r\n\r\nthat  we  could also enact legislation to the Penal  Code  to\r\n\r\ngive  effect  to the Genocide Convention.  But  there  is  no\r\n\r\npressing  urgency  to do that, and it is a  matter  that  our\r\n\r\ndraftsmen  in  the Attorney-General's Chambers  have  on  the\r\n\r\nagenda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered most of the questions of Mr\r\n\r\nSimon Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Chandra Mohan also for his support, and he\r\n\r\nhas  raised a few questions too.  One is: why is it  that  we\r\n\r\ndid  not  enact the UN Act earlier; on reflection, we  should\r\n\r\nhave  anticipated  this?   Yes, we could  have  enacted  this\r\n\r\nearlier.   But  we did not do so because we  found  that  our\r\n\r\nprevious  practice had served us well.  By that I  mean  that\r\n\r\nwhere  we  have not been able to give effect to the  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil's resolutions, we amended legislation as and when the\r\n\r\noccasion  arose.   Because there was no pressing  urgency  to\r\n\r\nhave  this  kind  of  enabling  legislation.   Most  of   the\r\n\r\nresolutions give ample time for implementation.  And also  we\r\n\r\nfound  that  we  were able to implement previous  resolutions\r\n\r\neither  through  administrative measures or through  existing\r\n\r\nlegislation.   As  and  when  we  need  it,  we  amend  other\r\n\r\nlegislation, as I mentioned in my main speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has happened really is that the scope and\r\n\r\nnature  of UN sanctions have changed recently.  And  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  up  to  the  early 1990s, the sanctions were  relatively\r\n\r\nstraightforward  such as trade and arms  embargoes,  but  the\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  nature of sanctions now being  implemented  by\r\n\r\nthe United Nations Security Council presents a completely new\r\n\r\npicture  and  this is why we have decided that  the  previous\r\n\r\nsystem of ad hoc amendment of legislation may not be workable\r\n\r\nanymore, and that is why we have come to this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse for this kind of enabling legislation which will enable\r\n\r\nus  to  implement the resolution which is, as  you  may  have\r\n\r\nseen,  very sweeping in nature.  It has changed in the  sense\r\n\r\nthat  time  becomes  of the essence.  You have  to  implement\r\n\r\nspeedily  and  report speedily to the Security  Council.   In\r\n\r\nmost  cases now, after the resolution is adopted, a committee\r\n\r\nis  set  up,  which is loosely referred to as  the  Sanctions\r\n\r\nCommittee.   The members would be asked to report  very  soon\r\n\r\nwhat  they have done and what kind of follow-up actions  they\r\n\r\nhave taken.  So really there is no luxury of time anymore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked how active we are at the United Nations in\r\n\r\nproposing resolution on terrorism.  It is really not  a  case\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  proposing our own resolutions to the  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.   It calls for international discussions in  various\r\n\r\nforums,  both within as well as outside the UN.  Thus,  while\r\n\r\nwe are active in the UN Security Council, you would have read\r\n\r\nin  the  papers that ASEAN recently had a ministerial meeting\r\n\r\non  transnational crimes where they had also decided to  take\r\n\r\nspecific  cooperative measures on terrorism.  It is a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich  must be tackled at all fronts, both on the wide global\r\n\r\nplane  at  the  UN  and also outside the UN at  the  relevant\r\n\r\nforum,  including law enforcement at expert levels where  the\r\n\r\npeople are engaged in exchange of information and operational\r\n\r\ncooperative measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the definition of terrorism. I must say\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  one  of  the  most difficult  issues  in  any\r\n\r\ndiscussion on measures against terrorism.  It is a  difficult\r\n\r\nissue for the Security Council, for the General Assembly  and\r\n\r\nin  any  other  forum  where they are discussing  this.   The\r\n\r\nMember  was  thinking aloud the definition of a terrorist  as\r\n\r\nanyone \"who commits terrorism\" on a large scale, or something\r\n\r\nto  that effect.  Then you would have another nice debate  as\r\n\r\nto  what  is \"terrorism\" and what is not terrorism.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  approach  taken by the Security Council  was  that  this\r\n\r\nissue  may  have to be tackled at some stage, but you  cannot\r\n\r\nallow  this  lack  of agreement or lack  of  clarity  on  the\r\n\r\ndetails  to prevent international committees getting together\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaking  a collective action.  When the Committee, established\r\n\r\nunder Resolution 1373, gets down to business, they will  have\r\n\r\nto  address some specific issues and this will be one of  the\r\n\r\nissues that they will address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the point that Singapore's position at the UN\r\n\r\nand  elsewhere must be to condemn terrorism anywhere and  not\r\n\r\njust terrorism that occurs in the United States.  But it  has\r\n\r\nnever  been our position that we only condemn terrorism which\r\n\r\nhas taken place in the United States.  If he had read all the\r\n\r\nstatements made by Singapore on terrorism, on acts  committed\r\n\r\nelsewhere before September 11th or after September 11th,  and\r\n\r\nif  he had followed the speeches given, starting from DPM  BG\r\n\r\nLee's  speech at the Forbes, then the Prime Minister's speech\r\n\r\nat  the  memorial  service, right up to the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nspeech   yesterday,  if  one  thing  should   be   clear   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as well as to people outside Singapore,  it  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  been consistent in condemning  all  forms  of\r\n\r\nterrorism,  whoever perpetrates it against whichever  country\r\n\r\nor  whichever people it is directed against.  This  continues\r\n\r\nto  be  our  firm stand, both within and outside  the  United\r\n\r\nNations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His final point was about banking secrecy. Let me\r\n\r\nassure  him  that whatever is necessary to implement  the  UN\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council's resolution to give effect to UN  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil's resolution on freezing of funds, giving information\r\n\r\nto  the  UN  on  whether  funds of terrorists  have  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  if  it  is not already covered  by  the  relevant\r\n\r\namendments to the Monetary Authority of Singapore  (MAS)  Act\r\n\r\nlast year, then it would be covered under the new regulation.\r\n\r\nBut  we  find  that  the  requirements  of  the  UN  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil's resolution with regard to freezing of assets and so\r\n\r\non  can  be adequately done under the amendments to  the  MAS\r\n\r\nlegislation.  If it is not sufficient, then, of course, other\r\n\r\nmeasures may be needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Prof. Jayakumar].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS (TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>OVERSEAS VOTING) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>1.38 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 19th April 2001, the Government amended the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Elections Act to provide for overseas  voting,\r\n\r\nand  announced  plans to have overseas voting in  the  coming\r\n\r\nGeneral Elections at five of Singapore's diplomatic missions,\r\n\r\nnamely,  Beijing, Hong Kong, Canberra, London and Washington.\r\n\r\nPreparations were already underway, and on 26th September the\r\n\r\nElections  Department  announced that  eligible  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nliving overseas could start to register to vote at these five\r\n\r\nmissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th September, the Government announced its decision\r\n\r\nnot   to  conduct  overseas  voting  in  the  coming  General\r\n\r\nElection.   I will explain the rationale for the Government's\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nSecurity Considerations Overriding\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 28th September 2001 the Government received\r\n\r\ninformation on the actions that the United States planned  to\r\n\r\ntake.   The  Government  then came  to  the  conclusion  that\r\n\r\nmilitary action by the United States was imminent.   We  also\r\n\r\nhad  information  that  a  second  wave  of  attacks  by  the\r\n\r\nterrorists was expected, especially after the United  States'\r\n\r\nmilitary  action, and the targets would not just  be  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States.   This  second wave of  attacks  may  not  be\r\n\r\nsimilar in nature as the first.  There\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  also media reports that biological and chemical weapons\r\n\r\nmight  be used.  The Government could not ignore these threat\r\n\r\nscenarios,  and  the danger these would pose  to  our  people\r\n\r\noverseas  should  we  go  ahead with  overseas  voting.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  then  did a re-assessment of  the  situation  and\r\n\r\ndecided  that it was best not to expose our citizens overseas\r\n\r\nto  unnecessary  risks.  We were not able  to  disclose  this\r\n\r\ninformation  in the press statement issued on 29th  September\r\n\r\n2001   as  doing  so  at  that  time  would  compromise   our\r\n\r\nintelligence sources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we know that United States military action began on\r\n\r\n7th  October.  They were joined by the United Kingdom.  Osama\r\n\r\nbin Ladin and  the Al-Qaeda leaders have said repeatedly that\r\n\r\nthey  would  strike  back.  There are now  several  cases  of\r\n\r\nanthrax reported in the United States.  Although these  cases\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  linked  directly to the  terrorists,  United\r\n\r\nStates  Vice-President Dick Cheney said a few days  ago  that\r\n\r\nthe  rising  number  of  anthrax cases  could  be  linked  to\r\n\r\nterrorists.  Bio-terrorism is a real possibility.   Over  the\r\n\r\nweekend, the FBI said it had received information that  there\r\n\r\nmay  be additional attacks inside the United States or abroad\r\n\r\nin  the next few days, and asked all law enforcement agencies\r\n\r\nto  go on the highest alert.  One possible threat cited by  a\r\n\r\nUnited States intelligence official was attacks on diplomatic\r\n\r\nsites  overseas.   It is no consolation that  we  are  proven\r\n\r\nright in our belief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Singaporeans to congregate at known locations\r\n\r\noverseas  on a published date for the purpose of voting  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  expose our citizens to unnecessary security  risk.\r\n\r\nWe cannot take the security and safety of our fellow citizens\r\n\r\nfor  granted, no matter which part of the world they  may  be\r\n\r\nin.   Many  capital  cities have gone  on  heightened  alert,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  five  cities which  were  to  have  been  our\r\n\r\noverseas  voting  centres.  We  cannot  expect  foreign  host\r\n\r\ncountries  to  guarantee  the safety  of  our  people,  under\r\n\r\ncurrent   circumstances.   Moreover  they  have   their   own\r\n\r\npriorities and risks to manage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our overseas missions have been advised to heighten\r\n\r\ntheir   security   alertness,  such  as   looking   out   for\r\n\r\nunidentified  vehicles parked close to the chancery  building\r\n\r\nor  unattended receptacles and items.  However, there is only\r\n\r\nso  much  that  they  can do.  Having to additionally  manage\r\n\r\nvoter  registration  and  voting will  dilute  the  missions'\r\n\r\nresources   further,  and  hamper  their   effectiveness   in\r\n\r\nessential  duties  such as covering and monitoring  the  fast\r\n\r\ndeveloping  and  changing events in their  respective  areas,\r\n\r\nwhich   serve  to  protect  Singapore's  national  interests.\r\n\r\nPutting too much stress on our missions will inevitably raise\r\n\r\nthe risk of security lapses, something we must avoid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tension has mounted following the military strikes\r\n\r\nin  Afghanistan.   We  do not know when,  where  or  how  the\r\n\r\nterrorists  will  strike  back.  Security  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nfurther tightened.  Events are unfolding as situations change\r\n\r\nday by day.  We cannot anticipate what may come the next day.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  be prepared for the worst. Freedom of  movement\r\n\r\ncould well be severely reduced.  Airports and roads could  be\r\n\r\nclosed,  and public transport at a standstill.  Our  missions\r\n\r\nwill  then  also  have to cope with the upsurge  of  consular\r\n\r\nwork, looking after the welfare of citizens who are overseas.\r\n\r\nIn  the  extreme, our missions may even have to be shut  down\r\n\r\npartially  or completely, interrupting any elections  related\r\n\r\nwork or even stopping them entirely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As security considerations are overriding, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  therefore  decided  reluctantly,  in   these\r\n\r\nexceptional  circumstances, that there will  be  no  overseas\r\n\r\nvoting in the coming General Election.  Clause 2 of the  Bill\r\n\r\nsuspends   the   relevant  provisions  in  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections Act to effect this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Bill is deemed to take effect from 26th\r\n\r\nSeptember 2001, until the Bill is passed and signed into law,\r\n\r\nthe   present  law  allowing  for  registration  of  overseas\r\n\r\nelectors  remains in force.  This means that at  present  the\r\n\r\nRegistration  Officer  will  have  to  continue  to   receive\r\n\r\napplications from overseas voters in accordance with the  law\r\n\r\nin force today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClause 3 of the Bill has thus been added to validate the acts\r\n\r\nand decisions of the Registration Officer not to register any\r\n\r\nnon-resident citizens as an overseas elector taken since 28th\r\n\r\nSeptember 2001 until the registers of electors are certified.\r\n\r\nCurrent Situation\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sole reason for Government's decision is\r\n\r\nsecurity.   At  the 25th September sitting of  Parliament,  I\r\n\r\nbriefed Members of the House on the security threat faced  by\r\n\r\nSingapore, as a result of the recent terrorist attacks in the\r\n\r\nUS.   The  Prime  Minister himself elaborated  on  this  last\r\n\r\nevening at his dialogue with the trade union leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States and United Kingdom have started to\r\n\r\nattack  terrorists hideouts in Afghanistan  on  7th  October.\r\n\r\nThe  financial  assets  of terrorist groups  have  also  been\r\n\r\nfrozen.   The  United  Nations Security  Council  has  passed\r\n\r\nresolutions prohibiting the funding or the giving of any form\r\n\r\nof  assistance  to  terrorists.  The  terrorist  groups  have\r\n\r\nthreatened to launch counter-attacks on countries taking part\r\n\r\nin these anti-terrorist measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a responsible member of the United Nations\r\n\r\nand  of  the world community.  We have repeatedly stated  our\r\n\r\nstand  against terrorism and will play our part to bring  the\r\n\r\nperpetrators   of  terrorism  to  justice.   Singapore   will\r\n\r\nimplement the recently passed United Nations Security Council\r\n\r\nResolution 1373 with the United Nations Bill just  passed  by\r\n\r\nParliament  this  afternoon,  to demonstrate  our  resolution\r\n\r\nagainst  terrorism.   We will play our  part  in  the  global\r\n\r\neffort   to  freeze  the  financial  resources  of  terrorist\r\n\r\nnetworks.   It  is only when all the countries in  the  world\r\n\r\nunite  against  terrorism that we can  hope  to  remove  this\r\n\r\nscourge from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the\r\n\r\nUnited  States in 1990, enabling the use of our bases  by  US\r\n\r\nair  force  and navy units to transit through  Singapore.   A\r\n\r\nhigher volume of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naircraft   and   ships  are  transiting  through   Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially since the US launched its retaliatory attacks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these recent developments, Singapore has\r\n\r\nnow  got to be more vigilant.  Like other countries, we  have\r\n\r\nstepped up security measures to protect our people and  vital\r\n\r\ninstallations and offices, here and abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must not forget that Singapore has not been\r\n\r\nspared  from  terrorist attacks.  In 1974, the  Japanese  Red\r\n\r\nArmy  hijacked a ferry, the Laju.  And in 1985 and 1986,  two\r\n\r\nbombs  exploded  at Faber House in Orchard  Road.   In  1991,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airlines flight SQ 117 was hijacked  by  Pakistani\r\n\r\nmilitants.   We  cannot,  therefore, afford  to  take  things\r\n\r\nlightly  just because we have not been affected  directly  in\r\n\r\nthe September 11 attacks.\r\n\r\nSuspension of Overseas Voting\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people have speculated that it was due to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wanting  to  call  a  snap  election   that   the\r\n\r\nregistration for overseas voting was suspended.  They surmise\r\n\r\nthat  the  Elections Department was not ready  for  an  early\r\n\r\nelection.   Let  me  say  that this is  not  the  case.   All\r\n\r\nelements for overseas voting system are operationally  ready.\r\n\r\nThe  Elections  Department has already distributed  brochures\r\n\r\nand  application  forms  to our missions  overseas.  It  also\r\n\r\nbriefed  the  officers from the Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs\r\n\r\nwho, in turn, briefed the mission staff and helped out in the\r\n\r\npublic  enquiries and registration there.  The polling booths\r\n\r\nand ballot boxes that were specially made for overseas voting\r\n\r\nwere  also  ready.  In fact, some officers were sent  to  the\r\n\r\nfive  missions  on  26th September when the announcement  was\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Elections Department to assist the missions  in\r\n\r\nthe registration of overseas voters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained at length, the overriding\r\n\r\nconsideration is that of security. However, there  may  still\r\n\r\nbe  sceptics  or cynics who will choose not to believe  this.\r\n\r\nSo  should  there be an election soon, they will say,  \"There\r\n\r\nyou  are,  I  told  you  so.\"   Let  me  reiterate  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility  is  to  protect its people.   We  will  avoid\r\n\r\nputting   overseas  Singaporeans  at  unnecessary   risk   in\r\n\r\nsituations  which are not within our control.  The Government\r\n\r\ncould still call a snap election if it wanted to.  But it has\r\n\r\nnothing to do with cancelling overseas registration.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is just as disappointed as many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are that there will be no overseas voting in the\r\n\r\ncoming  General  Election.   The Elections  Department  would\r\n\r\nhave  gained  valuable experience if overseas voting  at  the\r\n\r\nfive  missions  proceeded as planned.  The  Government  hopes\r\n\r\nthat  the Singapore citizens abroad who had intended to  cast\r\n\r\ntheir votes at these five voting centres will understand  the\r\n\r\nextraordinary international security situation which has made\r\n\r\nthis decision necessary.  Finally, I stress that this is only\r\n\r\na  temporary suspension of overseas voting.  It is  certainly\r\n\r\nnot  a  permanent  reversal of Government policy.   The  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides for suspension of the relevant provisions related to\r\n\r\noverseas  voting  only until the polling day  of  the  coming\r\n\r\nGeneral Election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to begin by\r\n\r\nthanking  the  Minister  for his very  full  explanation  and\r\n\r\nresponse to the market talk, or town talk, that there  was  a\r\n\r\nconnection between the suspension of overseas voting and  the\r\n\r\ntalk of an early General Election.  I think that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nshould  have the reassurance, as the Minister has  given  us,\r\n\r\nthat  this  House,  after deciding on overseas  voting,  does\r\n\r\nvalue  overseas Singaporeans who are working abroad and  wish\r\n\r\nto  cast  their votes.  And I am glad also that the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  taken  pains to point out, in detail, how  the  relevant\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies were ready to do this in time even  if  a\r\n\r\nsnap  election is called.  And I think in this sense, I would\r\n\r\nagree  with  him  that, having heard him, even  if  an  early\r\n\r\nGeneral Election is called,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit would be coincidence rather than causation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has shared with us some of his evaluation\r\n\r\nof  risks for our overseas Embassies.  Could he tell us  what\r\n\r\nother  events might be affected?  For example,  would  it  be\r\n\r\nthat  events  at our Embassies abroad would be cut  down  or,\r\n\r\nperhaps,  cut  out  altogether?  For  example,  large  public\r\n\r\nreceptions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I would agree with the Minister that it\r\n\r\nis  best to forgo all five cities at one go.  There have been\r\n\r\nsome  suggestions, I think in the press, that if our  Embassy\r\n\r\nin  USA was the chief risk, why not allow voting to carry  on\r\n\r\nin  other countries?  I would, myself, think that this  would\r\n\r\nbe the wrong policy.  Firstly, I agree with the Minister that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  sound  in practice because the terrorists  could\r\n\r\nstrike  anywhere.  Secondly, I would further add that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  sound in principle because it would discriminate amongst\r\n\r\nour  overseas  voters; that is, those  in  America  might  be\r\n\r\ndeprived whereas those, say, in China will continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking further ahead, may I ask the Minister whether we\r\n\r\nshould  not  look  towards  secured  electronic  voting   for\r\n\r\noverseas Singaporeans.  Can we not use this time between this\r\n\r\ncoming  GE and the next to look into this possibility?   This\r\n\r\nshould  be  good  for the ease and security of  voting.   And\r\n\r\nsecondly,  it  would  be  a very good  demonstration  of  the\r\n\r\nsecurity of electronic commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, voting at the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Election  is a right of every Singaporean  and  this\r\n\r\nextends to some of our citizens living abroad as a result  of\r\n\r\nthe recent amendments to the Parliamentary Elections Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would submit, Mr Speaker, Sir, let our citizens decide\r\n\r\nwhether to vote or not to vote given the opportunity to  vote\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are living abroad, even if it means a  threat  to\r\n\r\ntheir  security, perceived or real.  Security  considerations\r\n\r\nare  important, no doubt.  So is the right to vote.   Can  we\r\n\r\nnot  utilise  electronic filing system and electronic  voting\r\n\r\nsystem to see how it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworks?   And this can be devised as soon as possible so  that\r\n\r\nthe market talk about the suspension of voting by our foreign\r\n\r\ncitizens is quelled.  Can we not in the process also secretly\r\n\r\ninform  our citizens, who are living abroad, that voting  can\r\n\r\nbe  held at a secret location?  And if you are really serious\r\n\r\nabout  this,  if we want to do it, we can.  Let  us  see  how\r\n\r\ningenious our Government is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems in this kind of issues is the lack\r\n\r\nof information, or there is very little information available\r\n\r\nto  our  citizens.   No doubt, the reason or  the  excuse  is\r\n\r\nsecurity  reasons.  And all in the name of security  reasons,\r\n\r\nthere  is  very little information for most people, including\r\n\r\nparliamentarians.    Perhaps,  more  information   could   be\r\n\r\ndisseminated to our citizens and parliamentarians.   We  must\r\n\r\nhave  confidence in our citizens to analyse this  information\r\n\r\nand  decide for themselves.  We must not treat it  as  though\r\n\r\nthey  will  react  adversely  to  any  information  that   is\r\n\r\ndisseminated  to  the citizens.  We must have  confidence  in\r\n\r\ntheir sensible and rational ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the danger signs of terrorism against Singapore\r\n\r\nand  our Embassies outside Singapore?  At the moment, we  are\r\n\r\nnot  quite sure.  No doubt, there may be information from the\r\n\r\ninternal  and  external  security agencies  to  convince  our\r\n\r\nMinister that we must not have overseas voting at the moment.\r\n\r\nBut  the  lack  of information disseminated to the  citizenry\r\n\r\nbrings about this form of suspicion that there could be other\r\n\r\nmotives.   So,  perhaps we will have to  find  some  sort  of\r\n\r\nbalance where this could be taken care of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue, Mr Speaker, Sir, if we are really\r\n\r\nserious about it, then do not call for General Election until\r\n\r\njust  before  August 2002.  One could argue, why  the  hurry?\r\n\r\nWhat  are the good reasons why we should have, from  what  we\r\n\r\nhear,  election  to  be held soon?  If there  is  a  pressing\r\n\r\nproblem  of security of our nation, then why call for General\r\n\r\nElection, because life goes on in Singapore, especially since\r\n\r\nit is a situation where there have not been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nany  major changes to bring about General Election, for which\r\n\r\nour Government still has time?  It has got another nine to 10\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you are going along that line, let us see what\r\n\r\nhappens  in the next few months.  If there is a reduction  in\r\n\r\nthe  discussion  and  acts of terrorism,  then  perhaps  this\r\n\r\nparticular Bill would not be necessary at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most overseas voters, as indicated by letters sent to\r\n\r\nthe press, are disappointed that they are not allowed to vote\r\n\r\nat  the  next  General  Election.  The reason  given  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for scrapping overseas voting is that the overseas\r\n\r\nMissions are not able to maintain sufficient security in  the\r\n\r\nlight of the 11th September terrorist attacks in New York and\r\n\r\nWashington DC, USA.  However, most overseas voters appear  to\r\n\r\nbe  sceptical  of  the reason given by the  Government.   One\r\n\r\noverseas  voter asked, \"If Washington is dangerous, then  why\r\n\r\nnot  continue  with the voting at the other  four  designated\r\n\r\ncentres in London, Beijing, Hong Kong and Canberra?\"  Indeed,\r\n\r\nwhy  not?  Many are also surprised that our overseas Missions\r\n\r\nlack confidence in their security systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Government is quick to cancel all\r\n\r\noverseas voting shows the attitude of the Government  towards\r\n\r\nthe  constitutional rights of its citizens.  For a long  time\r\n\r\nnow,  the  Opposition suspects that the Government has  never\r\n\r\nbeen  enthusiastic  about  the elections.   At  each  General\r\n\r\nElection, it wants to get it over as fast as possible.   Many\r\n\r\nGeneral  Elections had been held at the most  awkward  times,\r\n\r\neither  during festive-end or rainy seasons.  And the minimum\r\n\r\ntime  under  the  Constitution,  nine  days,  is  given   for\r\n\r\ncanvassing.  The scrapping of overseas voting in double-quick\r\n\r\ntime  is  evidence that the Government is  not  too  keen  on\r\n\r\ngiving Singaporeans their constitutional right to vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most overseas voters who wrote to the press recently\r\n\r\nindicated  that  they  want  to  vote  at  the  next  General\r\n\r\nElection, despite the terrorist attacks.  They feel that when\r\n\r\nthey  have  voted, they would have a stronger bond  to  their\r\n\r\nhomeland.   They  would feel that they are more  Singaporean,\r\n\r\nand  they  also  want to reassure themselves  that  they  are\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore.  I think the Government should  lift\r\n\r\nthe  suspension  for overseas voting and allow  our  citizens\r\n\r\nliving  abroad to vote at the next General Election,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, of course, making sure that all security measures\r\n\r\nare taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government thinks that to open all five overseas\r\n\r\ncentres is not very safe, then, at least, it should allow the\r\n\r\nother  four centres to go on.  There are substantial  numbers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore citizens abroad, other than those  residing  in\r\n\r\nAmerica.   Overseas  voters who are  not  living  in  America\r\n\r\nshould  be  given a chance to vote, and I would even  suggest\r\n\r\nthat,  perhaps, more overseas voting centres be opened.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  Australia, other than just having  it  only  in\r\n\r\nCanberra, we may have one, say, in Perth.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nthere are many, many Singapore students aged over 21 who  are\r\n\r\nstudying  in Perth.  They should be given a chance  to  vote.\r\n\r\nAlso,  there  are  many people who go over  to  China  to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness.  They should be given a chance to vote.  Maybe  one\r\n\r\nother centre can be opened, other than Beijing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, as I listened to the speakers before me, it is important\r\n\r\nthat  they be aware of the security issue, and that they have\r\n\r\nnot  given  sufficient  attention to that  aspect.   I  agree\r\n\r\nentirely with the Minister that the security of our citizens,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  overseas  stations, is  paramount.   Citizens\r\n\r\nprobably  would prefer to exercise their rights in reasonably\r\n\r\nsecure situations, and it would be best if their lives not be\r\n\r\nput  at risk due to the enhanced security problems now in the\r\n\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some speakers have mentioned about the use of\r\n\r\nelectronic voting, I should just like to ask the Minister  to\r\n\r\nclarify one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoint.   Overseas voting and electronic voting  are  two  new\r\n\r\nelements   that   were  brought  in  recently   through   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill.  Would the Minister\r\n\r\nconfirm  that the Elections Department would still  carry  on\r\n\r\nwith the electronic voting pilot scheme in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me first deal with the\r\n\r\nquestion from Prof. Chin Tet Yung about electronic voting.  I\r\n\r\nmoved an amendment in Parliament on this some months ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Elections Department has been progressing\r\n\r\nwith  this  matter  for  many months  ever  since  Parliament\r\n\r\napproved  having  electronic voting  in  the  coming  General\r\n\r\nElection.   They  have  been working very  closely  with  the\r\n\r\nvendors  and the systems designers to come up with a  system.\r\n\r\nIn fact, even before that, they also have a prototype plan to\r\n\r\neducate the public about how e-voting is supposed to be  done\r\n\r\nand  a  session was also arranged for our MPs to see how  the\r\n\r\nsystem works.  But the details have yet to be worked out  and\r\n\r\nthese  details  have  to  be worked out  with  the  technical\r\n\r\npeople, the software writers, the designers, as well as  with\r\n\r\nthe vendors who supply the system.  And that is only one part\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key part of it is how to ensure that electronic\r\n\r\nvoting  is supposed to do the job that we want it to do,  ie,\r\n\r\nto  allow voters to vote in secret.  We have agreed that  the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General  should  be  the  authority  to  certify  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   The  Auditor-General has appointed a consultant  to\r\n\r\nwork  closely  with his staff, to help them  look  into  this\r\n\r\nsystem to ensure that its objectives are met.  They have been\r\n\r\ndoing this for the last several months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elections Department has also spent money buying\r\n\r\nequipment   and  on  developing  software  to   develop   the\r\n\r\nelectronic  voting  system  for use  in  the  coming  General\r\n\r\nElection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are many issues to be resolved. The key part\r\n\r\nreally is in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertification  exercise, as well as the  matrix  involved  in\r\n\r\ndetermining  what goes in.  Apparently, I am told  that  this\r\n\r\nhas  taken  some  time, and issues on whether the  acceptance\r\n\r\ntests and the certification tests can be ready in time before\r\n\r\nthe  next  General Election or not, we do not  know  because,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  current timetable, they are supposed  to  complete\r\n\r\nthis  process by the end of December.  So, if the  system  is\r\n\r\nready  and  we  have elections, then, yes, e-voting  will  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.   But when we have elections and the  system  is\r\n\r\nnot  ready, then certainly we cannot use e-voting as a  pilot\r\n\r\nin a one or two constituencies that we plan to do when I last\r\n\r\nspoke.  So that is the status of electronic voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the other parts of the debate which\r\n\r\nseveral  Members  have  also spoken, and  I  thank  them  for\r\n\r\nraising  their  views here and allowing me an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nclarify some of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked us to look at the way of securing\r\n\r\noverseas  voting  and to come out with an  electronic  voting\r\n\r\nsystem.   Even  a simple system like that in  which  we  talk\r\n\r\nabout  touch  screen and keying in \"Yes\" or  \"No\"  and  which\r\n\r\nparty,  etc,  already  takes time.   And  that  is  not  even\r\n\r\nelectronic  in  the  real sense of  the  word,  where  it  is\r\n\r\ntransmitted from one station to another.  It is just a simple\r\n\r\nsystem  in a particular polling station and nothing goes  out\r\n\r\nof  that  space.  When you have electronic voting  or  secure\r\n\r\noverseas voting, through either the Web or through some other\r\n\r\nmeans,  that is an issue far more difficult than the e-voting\r\n\r\nthat  we  are planning.  Even in the United States, I believe\r\n\r\none  state has commissioned an expert study on this and  they\r\n\r\nhave come to the conclusion that, today, there is no safe way\r\n\r\nof  having Internet voting or voting on the Web.  There is no\r\n\r\nway  that it can ensure that the system works for them in the\r\n\r\nway  that  they wanted.  So, this also deals with Mr  Chandra\r\n\r\nMohan's point.  We cannot design a system just like that.  It\r\n\r\ntakes  expertise, many, many experts and hours, to  come  out\r\n\r\nwith something.  And if the country that has the most experts\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  is most knowledgeable, the United States, has not tried\r\n\r\nit, I think we must fear to tread.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of right to vote, I have dealt with this\r\n\r\nat  great length - whether citizens have a right to vote  and\r\n\r\nwhether  overseas citizens have a right to  vote,  and  there\r\n\r\nwere many verbal gymnastic sessions that we had been through,\r\n\r\nI  would not go into this detail here today.  If hon. Members\r\n\r\nwill refer to the Hansard as well as to the other speeches  I\r\n\r\nhave  made,  we have settled that quite clearly.   No  doubt,\r\n\r\nsome  people may still raise this question, but  the  law  is\r\n\r\nvery, very clear.  The law, as it stands before our amendment\r\n\r\nto  allow  for  overseas  voting, is quite  clear  that  only\r\n\r\ncitizens resident in Singapore can vote.  Then we amended the\r\n\r\nlaw  to provide for citizens overseas to vote, provided  they\r\n\r\nmeet  certain conditions.  We have set the conditions and  we\r\n\r\nwill  now  see how that will work out before we consider  any\r\n\r\nchange to these conditions.  So I will not deal with that for\r\n\r\nnow until we have tried that out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we want to open up more centres in other\r\n\r\nparts  of the world, in other countries, whether it is  going\r\n\r\nto be in Perth or Shanghai or Shenzhen, etc, I have also said\r\n\r\nthat  the  five centres that we have selected  are  the  five\r\n\r\ncapital cities and, according to the Vienna Convention, these\r\n\r\nare places where we have our consular officers there, we have\r\n\r\nour  diplomatic community there and we conduct  our  business\r\n\r\nthere as a sovereign Government.  That we will continue to do\r\n\r\nso.   To  try  to expand all that into other areas,  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  are  other issues that we will have to  deal  with  as\r\n\r\nwell.  So we will leave that to later, when we have tried out\r\n\r\nhow  the  selected Missions can implement a system like  that\r\n\r\nwhen we have overseas voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether to have it in the other four Missions, apart\r\n\r\nfrom   Washington,  like  Mr  Chiam  and  Mr  Chandra   Mohan\r\n\r\nsuggested, Mr Simon Tay made a valid point that we should not\r\n\r\nbe  selective  in  allowing Singaporeans  overseas  to  vote.\r\n\r\nBesides, the security consideration is the same.  We are  not\r\n\r\nsaying that only the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited  States has a problem.  In my speech, I have said,  at\r\n\r\nlength,  that we cannot expect what will come the  next  day.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  Mr  Chiam was not here when  I  explained  in\r\n\r\ngreat  detail the reasons why we have decided to cancel  this\r\n\r\nregistration of overseas voting, and he raised, in his speech\r\n\r\na  number of questions which I have actually dealt  with.   I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest  that he reads my speech when the  Hansard  is\r\n\r\nout.   Or if he would like to borrow a copy of the statement,\r\n\r\nI would be pleased to show it to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Mr Chandra Mohan's suggestion to secretly tell\r\n\r\noverseas voters about voting in a secret location, we  cannot\r\n\r\nfind a way to inform citizens secretly about voting in secret\r\n\r\nplaces.  No matter how ingenious we are - we are clever - but\r\n\r\nnot  that  clever to find such an ingenious way of  informing\r\n\r\ncitizens secretly about secret voting locations.  One  of  my\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretaries  once told  me  when  I  was  a  young\r\n\r\nofficer, \"Kan Seng, when two persons know of a matter, it  is\r\n\r\nno  longer a secret.\"  So, how are we going to tell thousands\r\n\r\nof overseas Singaporeans, \"This is a secret location.  I tell\r\n\r\nyou secretly, please go and vote on this secret day.\"  It  is\r\n\r\njust  beyond  my  ability to think about  it.   Maybe  if  Mr\r\n\r\nChandra  Mohan  can find a way of doing so,  please  secretly\r\n\r\ntell me about it!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chandra Mohan's question on calling for the GE and\r\n\r\nhis suggestion that we do not call for it until the situation\r\n\r\nis  more  secure since we have up to August 2002 to call  it,\r\n\r\nlet  me  say that it is the prerogative of the Government  to\r\n\r\ncall  for  an election any time between now and August  2002.\r\n\r\nWho  is  to determine that this is the best time?  It  surely\r\n\r\nmust be the Government.  Who is to say that if we extend this\r\n\r\nto   August   2002,  we  can  expect  no  further  unforeseen\r\n\r\ncircumstances?  I cannot guarantee that.  I cannot  tell  him\r\n\r\nthat if we defer this for the time being until the attack  is\r\n\r\nover, until the terrorist counter-attack, everything will  be\r\n\r\npeaceful and calm and we will back to our life as per normal.\r\n\r\nI  cannot guarantee that today.  Even before September  11th,\r\n\r\nin  some  places, maybe he can.  But there is  no  utopia  on\r\n\r\nearth.  Unfortunately, we cannot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntell  what  may happen between now and August 2002.   So  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has to choose the best time to have an  election.\r\n\r\nIt  may be coming soon.  It may be August 2002.  So, we  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  wait  and see.  If people expect that  election  is\r\n\r\ncoming soon, then let them be prepared for it.  If they think\r\n\r\nthat we should follow Mr Chandra Mohan's advice and wait till\r\n\r\nAugust 2002, so be it.  I think we let it be like that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About giving information to people on security threats\r\n\r\nthat we face, we would like to share as much as possible but,\r\n\r\nat  the  same time, we must also not unnecessarily alarm  our\r\n\r\npeople  about  every piece of information  that  we  receive.\r\n\r\nEven  in  the United States, I do not think that all the  key\r\n\r\npeople   are  privy  to  all  the  secrets  and  intelligence\r\n\r\ninformation.   Even  for the Intelligence  Committee  in  the\r\n\r\nCongress,  I  do  not think they are privy to  every  bit  of\r\n\r\nintelligence  information,  but  they  receive  Congressional\r\n\r\nnotes, briefings from the intelligence agencies.  If need be,\r\n\r\nwe will tell the public what happened but we will choose what\r\n\r\nto  tell, because we also have to make sure that the  sources\r\n\r\nof  information  that  we  receive are  also  protected.   By\r\n\r\nnature,  security must be something that we  must  take  very\r\n\r\nseriously, and not simply publicise it every time we  receive\r\n\r\na  piece of information.  We will tell the people as much  as\r\n\r\nwe can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the questions that\r\n\r\nwere  raised  by Members here.  If there is anything  that  I\r\n\r\nhave missed out that Members think is important, please raise\r\n\r\nit again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have a few questions about e-voting. On the road-show that the Minister is talking about,\r\n\r\nwhen  will  it  come  on?  The second question  is  how  many\r\n\r\nconstituencies will have e-voting?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> We would like to do the road-show\r\n\r\nwith  the equipment and the system that closely resemble what\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to do for the actual e-voting.   Then  it  is\r\n\r\nmeaningful in the public education exercise.  If we  were  to\r\n\r\nuse  the  prototype  that the Elections  Department  and  its\r\n\r\nvendors worked out to educate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe public, I think it may confuse the people.  So we have to\r\n\r\nwait for that said system to be ready before we can start the\r\n\r\nroad-show to educate the public.  As I have said, the  system\r\n\r\nis not likely to be ready until the end of this year.  So, we\r\n\r\ncannot  have  road-shows definitely before the  end  of  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how many constituencies will have this e-voting, I\r\n\r\nhave said, as a pilot, we will choose one or maybe two single\r\n\r\nmember constituencies.  It is small scale, big enough for  us\r\n\r\nto  try  out  and,  at  the same time,  give  us  a  hands-on\r\n\r\nexperience as well as educate the public on what e-voting  is\r\n\r\nall  about.  If Potong Pasir would like to volunteer, we will\r\n\r\nthink about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I made it clear to the Minister\r\n\r\nthe  last  time when the prototype was shown to the MPs  that\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir is definitely not interested in e-voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> It is all right if Mr Chiam does not\r\n\r\nlike  it.  But Mr Low Thia Khiang, when he made a speech here\r\n\r\nduring  the  debate on the Second Reading  of  the  Amendment\r\n\r\nBill, welcomed it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, it is a question that the Minister\r\n\r\nmay have missed.  This is a simple question that while I give\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of the doubt to the Government's assessment  of\r\n\r\nsecurity, I would like to ask the Minister whether any  other\r\n\r\nchanges  will be made to security at our overseas  embassies,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the holding of large receptions.  Second, is a point\r\n\r\nof  clarification.  When I mentioned about  the  prospect  of\r\n\r\nlooking   into  a  secured  electronic  voting  for  overseas\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, I did not mean that it is for now, but I meant,\r\n\r\nprospectively, for the next General Election.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, we will look at all kinds of\r\n\r\nsystems  that  may  come by.  In fact, after  we  showed  the\r\n\r\nprototype to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament and after we got a vendor to  come  up\r\n\r\nwith a system and they are still working on it, I also got  a\r\n\r\nbriefing  from  the  Indians who had an  e-voting  system,  a\r\n\r\nsimple gadget which had been implemented in several states in\r\n\r\nIndia.  We have looked at the system.  It is very simple, and\r\n\r\nwe are exploring that too as a possibility.  Of course, there\r\n\r\nis one missing key element in that Indian system, and that is\r\n\r\nthe  inability for us to know whether it is a real  voter  or\r\n\r\nsomebody else who pressed the key.  Whereas in our system, we\r\n\r\nhave  a serial number, and in case there is a challenge or  a\r\n\r\npetition to the court, the court will then say, \"Check,  open\r\n\r\nthis  up\", and we will know whether there is such a voter  or\r\n\r\nnot.   But in the Indian system, this check is not available.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have asked them to explore whether they could put  in\r\n\r\nsomething that will allow us to trace, whether it is  a  real\r\n\r\nvoter with the right name in the register.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards to holding a large reception by our missions,\r\n\r\nour  missions  would  have  to  take  all  the  factors  into\r\n\r\nconsideration, including the importance of the occasion,  the\r\n\r\nsecurity aspects, as well as other considerations before they\r\n\r\ndecide  whether to have or not to have a large reception.   I\r\n\r\nmust leave that to the missions to exercise their judgment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\"\r\n\r\n-  [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-six Minutes past two'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
