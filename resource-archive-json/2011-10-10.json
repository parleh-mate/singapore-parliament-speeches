While initially\r\nsome of us who made longer speeches were apprehensive about these changes\r\nthat they would curtail debate, we finally realised that it was\r\nbetter to focus and be concise than to make lengthy speeches and\r\nnot necessarily deliver the messages that we wanted to deliver effectively.\r\nI think I speak for most Members of the House to say that it was\r\nfar better to have the time limit than to stretch the Committee\r\nof Supply to more number of days.

After being cut off once in my reply during the\r\nCommittee of Supply debates some years back, I learned how to repackage\r\nmy replies within the constraints of time. I am sure Members of\r\nthis House have also learned to be succinct and impactful even in\r\na short speech.

Speaker Abdullah carried with\r\nhim many years of experience with the grassroots as an MP, before\r\nhe assumed office as Speaker, and continued to remain close to the\r\nground even after he was elected as Speaker. I mentioned the grassroots because\r\nI am of the view that it is vitally important that the Speaker continues\r\nto be connected with the ground so that he is able to appreciate\r\nthe concerns of ordinary Singaporeans and to allow MPs sufficient\r\nlatitude to raise and thoroughly debate issues that are of concern\r\nto all Singaporeans. While the debates we participate in and the business\r\nthat is transacted in this House have wide-ranging effects for all\r\nSingaporeans, few outside the House fully understand how we function.\r\nUnder his leadership as Speaker, Parliament was demystified and\r\nmade more relevant through, for example, the provision of more information\r\nabout parliamentary processes on the Parliament website, details\r\nof Members as well as the encouragement of educational tours to Parliament\r\nHouse. The Prime Minister had previously highlighted that one of\r\nthe changes that Speaker Abdullah made was to allow Members to speak\r\nin any combination or all four of the official languages during\r\na single speech. This may not seem like much on the surface but,\r\nas a multi-lingual and multi-racial Singapore, it is yet another\r\nmove to keep Parliament closer to the people. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-add99746-f7b8-4ca9-896b-80b26ced4219\">\r\n                  <a name=\"speaker__id-add99746-f7b8-4ca9-896b-80b26ced4219\"><!--a--></a>As Speaker Abdullah steps\r\naway from the front and centre of public life, he will be missed\r\nby many of us in this House, although I am sure he will continue\r\nto contribute to Singapore in other ways.
