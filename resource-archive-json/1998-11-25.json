Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure\r\n\r\nfor  the  last  few  days, you have listened to  many  colourful\r\n\r\nspeeches.  There will be 18 more after me and I hope you will be\r\n\r\nable to have a keen ear in terms of what would be expressed.   I\r\n\r\nam  sure,  Mr Speaker, you will be able to write a thesis  after\r\n\r\nthat!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like, first of all, to commend the members of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness for mapping out  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  comprehensive strategy to meet Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\nand  future challenges.  The Report sets out the direction   and\r\n\r\nwe  have  got  various inputs.  The members have indeed  done  a\r\n\r\nsignificant job in compiling a very comprehensive report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to also commend is the very effective and\r\n\r\nimmediate  measures taken by the Government  to  implement  with\r\n\r\nimmediate  effect  the  cost  cutting  measures  to  boost   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  The measures are very significant and  I  hope\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans will rally behind the Government  to  see  how\r\n\r\nthey  can  support  a  plan which can  be  implemented  to  help\r\n\r\nSingapore  to be viable and to be able to meet the more  serious\r\n\r\nchallenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having a plan is not sufficient but I think we will\r\n\r\nhave  to  examine why Singapore is one of the countries in  Asia\r\n\r\nthat  is  not  seriously  affected and  dislocated  by  economic\r\n\r\nproblems,  unlike many other places.  I think most  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntend  to  take this for granted, that things are going well  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  there  are less issues that we are  challenged  with.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  is able to look after these issues.   They  are\r\n\r\ncapable  people  to  think of solutions.  I  feel  this  is  not\r\n\r\nrealistic,  Sir.   It is very important that we  go  behind  the\r\n\r\nreasons  as to what makes Singapore less affected by the current\r\n\r\neconomic problems.  This analysis is very important so  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  understand  the  fundamentals that  can  be  challenged  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like, at the outset, to state that political\r\n\r\nstability  is one of the cornerstones in our capacity to  remain\r\n\r\nafloat, and I see that we have also taken this for granted.   We\r\n\r\nshould  look  at  the political mess in many  of  the  countries\r\n\r\naround  the  region  and the world.  There  are  many  so-called\r\n\r\ndemocracies which have very good plans, good ideas, but many  of\r\n\r\nthese have not been implemented.  Many people in these countries\r\n\r\nare  affected  and many of them have no capacity or  ability  to\r\n\r\ninfluence such decisions that have been made, and many of  these\r\n\r\npeople  have  suffered  grave  economic  injustices  and   grave\r\n\r\nproblems  and regression in terms of their standard  of  living.\r\n\r\nAnd  all these are issues that we need to examine and appreciate\r\n\r\nin the context of why we have been able to manage effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what becomes very important when we are faced with a\r\n\r\nrecession  is our capacity to maintain good political  stability\r\n\r\nand  cohesion.   When  resources are limited,  there  is  always\r\n\r\ncompetition for resources, and the less able will not be able to\r\n\r\nget  the  kind of resources which they require for their living.\r\n\r\nSo  what is most important in this respect is that I would  like\r\n\r\nto urge employers to seriously examine the approaches they adopt\r\n\r\nin  the  employment of workers, in ensuring that their practices\r\n\r\nare  not discriminatory in terms of race, language and religion.\r\n\r\nThis is very important in the context of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore, because we are a multi-racial society.  If we believe\r\n\r\nin  the  principle  of meritocracy, then I think  employers,  in\r\n\r\ntimes of recession and economic problems, must be very objective\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  we deal with the problems of retrenchment  and\r\n\r\nunemployment  on  the basis of merit and objectivity.   This  is\r\n\r\nvery important.  Otherwise, we will upset the equilibrium of the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society that we live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we also have to look at the whole issue about\r\n\r\ngood  leadership in social institutions.  Unless  and  until  we\r\n\r\nensure  that  we  have good people managing our  various  social\r\n\r\ninstitutions, we may not be able to discharge the kind of  plans\r\n\r\nthat we have.  And what is important for us Singaporeans is that\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  ensure that we continue to have people  with  good\r\n\r\nleadership,  good  personal  integrity  and  honesty  to  manage\r\n\r\nvarious   social  institutions.   Because  these   very   social\r\n\r\ninstitutions, by their nature, are institutions that  will  make\r\n\r\nour  society viable.  It is not sufficient to say that  we  need\r\n\r\ngood social institutions, but it is important to ensure that  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  nurture  and  have good people who  can  manage  these\r\n\r\ninstitutions.    We  should  induct  good  people   into   these\r\n\r\ninstitutions   so  that  they  can  continue  to   manage   them\r\n\r\neffectively in the interest of the majority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we also need to look at a good plan to manage\r\n\r\nissues  ahead.  And the CSC Report is an effective plan in  that\r\n\r\nwe  have been able to mobilise various people to work on it  and\r\n\r\ncome  up  with various ideas that we can marshal and, hopefully,\r\n\r\nwith  the implementation of these ideas, we will be able to make\r\n\r\na  further stride in dealing with the economic problems that  we\r\n\r\nface.   So  good plans do require good people and good political\r\n\r\ncontext to manage and implement them.  Without these precursors,\r\n\r\nthe  best  ideas that we have will not see any fruition  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  not  have  any  impact on the social lives  and  to  solve\r\n\r\nvarious social problems that we may face in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we need to look at is to see how the CSC Report\r\n\r\ncould  address a number of issues which have been left  out.   I\r\n\r\nforesee that the issue of prolonged\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunemployment  needs to be re-examined very closely,  because  we\r\n\r\nhave  depended on full employment as a form of social  security.\r\n\r\nThis is good as long as full employment lasts, but we never know\r\n\r\nthrough  prolonged recessions, what impact this  would  have  on\r\n\r\npeople who are less skilled, semi-skilled and others who may not\r\n\r\nbe  able to find themselves employable.  We need to examine  the\r\n\r\nassumptions of full employment very critically, and  in  future,\r\n\r\nif  we run into a prolonged recession, there is a need to assess\r\n\r\nhow  people  who cannot be employed for a long time would  still\r\n\r\nhave a way to manage their lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prolonged unemployment is one of the issues that we\r\n\r\nneed  to examine and the CSC has not examined this issue  fully.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  look at what can be done, particularly  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers who would remain unemployable for a long time.   We  may\r\n\r\nargue that there are retraining funds available to upgrade them,\r\n\r\nthat  special funds would be available and set aside  for  their\r\n\r\ntraining,  but I think the issue at hand is their employability.\r\n\r\nIn  some circumstances, it may not be possible for them to  find\r\n\r\nemployment  itself because work institutions may not necessarily\r\n\r\ntake  them.   I feel that there is a need to look at either  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union level where some funds are set aside to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthe upgrading of these workers in order to solve their long-term\r\n\r\nemployment needs and problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue the CSC Report has not addressed is the\r\n\r\nchallenge of the older workforce.  This would be one of the more\r\n\r\nserious  challenges  that we are likely  to  face  in  the  next\r\n\r\ndecade.    And  with  an  older  workforce,  would   we   remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive?  This is a question we need to examine.  We may not\r\n\r\nbecome  competitive,  provided they  have  the  capacity  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained and upgraded and to move into job areas which would deal\r\n\r\nwith  information technology.  So I feel that with  a  declining\r\n\r\npopulation  which is below replacement,  the issue  will  become\r\n\r\nvery grave in the near future, and we have to look at how we can\r\n\r\nmaintain  a more robust workforce.  This means that we  have  to\r\n\r\nrecruit more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntalents,  more  semi-skilled and skilled workers  to  enter  our\r\n\r\nworkforce.   I  see  this  issue requires  to  be  studied  more\r\n\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government has set up the STAR Committee\r\n\r\nto  look  at these issues and, hopefully, it will solve some  of\r\n\r\nthe problems of the greying of our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give some comments on the Government\r\n\r\nmeasures  to reduce costs  which have been announced  yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe  measures  are comprehensive and will help to stimulate  our\r\n\r\neconomy.    The   measures  are  realistic  because   they   are\r\n\r\nimplementable  and some of them, in fact, have  taken  immediate\r\n\r\neffect.  Hopefully, with the implementation of these measures we\r\n\r\nwill be able to become more viable.  What is most important  and\r\n\r\ngratifying  to  note is that the direction of  the  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures  which are to be implemented works on the principle  of\r\n\r\nshared burden.  I am glad that the cost-cutting measures work on\r\n\r\nthe basis of those who can carry a heavier burden than those who\r\n\r\ncannot.   This is a very good principle and I must  applaud  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the effort in this direction, because  for  those\r\n\r\nwho are unable to do so they do sacrifice, but they do sacrifice\r\n\r\na little.  This, at all costs, will enhance our ownership to the\r\n\r\nproblem.  We will be able to promote the sense of commitment  to\r\n\r\nthe  various  issues  that we face.   This  in  itself  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.   People  feel that they can work  towards  a  common\r\n\r\ncause  and  we  are all sharing a common purpose  and  a  common\r\n\r\ndestiny,  and  we  all believe that we want  to  make  Singapore\r\n\r\nviable.   Therefore, the question of ownership to  these  issues\r\n\r\nthat we face has been reinforced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to urge is that we should have been a bit\r\n\r\nmore  generous  with the lower income group.  The  rebates  that\r\n\r\nhave  been granted by the Government provide an extension for  a\r\n\r\nfurther period of time in their relief.  But we could have  been\r\n\r\nmore  generous in increasing the amount of S&C charges  and  PUB\r\n\r\nrates.  That  would have relieved further some of their  burdens\r\n\r\nbecause many of them are unskilled and low income workers.  They\r\n\r\nwill face the greatest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpact  in terms of the capacity to manage their lives.   It  is\r\n\r\ndesirable and our responsibility to see that we can do much more\r\n\r\nthan what we have given to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area which seems to invite attention is the\r\n\r\nlevy.  Many working mothers are most disappointed that they have\r\n\r\nnot  been  given  a  reduction.  All other  companies  that  are\r\n\r\nemploying foreign workers have been given a reduction.  I  think\r\n\r\nworking   mothers  employing  domestic  maids   should   deserve\r\n\r\nattention  because many of them are working  hard  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nhelping  to develop our economy and making Singapore viable.   I\r\n\r\ndo not see any reason why their case could not be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very small proportion of working mothers benefit from the\r\n\r\ntax set-off.  A large proportion of them are not benefiting from\r\n\r\nthe  tax set-off measures.  I think it is not equitable  in  the\r\n\r\nsense  that we have over the years increased the levy, but  when\r\n\r\nall  other revenues are being reviewed, they should in  fact  be\r\n\r\ngiven  an  opportunity to benefit from the reduction.   In  that\r\n\r\nrespect, the argument that we want to dampen the demand for more\r\n\r\nof  them to employ maids should be re-examined.  I do not  think\r\n\r\nthe  reason  is  strong enough to support the argument  that  no\r\n\r\nreduction has been considered for them.  The issue is that  many\r\n\r\nof  them  are in the middle class group, which I would call  the\r\n\r\n\"sandwiched\"  families.  I feel that they should be  considered.\r\n\r\nThis  is  no  real  logical reason that I can gather  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  given due consideration for reduction  of  maid\r\n\r\nlevy.   There  is a very large sector that would be affected  in\r\n\r\nthese   trying  times.   I  hope  that  their  case   could   be\r\n\r\nreconsidered by the Minister for Manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, the social and economic crisis\r\n\r\nthat we are all facing is our problem.  It is important that  we\r\n\r\nhave to work together to fix it.  Unless we can rally around  to\r\n\r\nwork together and find new creative ways, new approaches and new\r\n\r\nsolutions  to all these issues, we would not be able  to  tackle\r\n\r\nthe problem as we hope to do so.  So it is very important for us\r\n\r\nas Singaporeans to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommit  ourselves  to working together.   I  am  sure  that  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will rally behind the Government to see what we can\r\n\r\ndo  in  our  own ways.  Whether big or small, we are all  to  be\r\n\r\ncounted.   Like  what our Mr Deputy Speaker has said,  small  is\r\n\r\nbeautiful.   It is not just beautiful, but we are  a  people  of\r\n\r\nmettle who can withstand and be counted as Singaporeans.  I hope\r\n\r\nwe  can  come together and find ways to weather the storm ahead.\r\n\r\nBy doing so, we will keep ourselves afloat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to join in this debate on the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been clarified by DPM Lee's response to the CSC\r\n\r\nReport  yesterday.   What  the  Government  will  do  now,  very\r\n\r\nshortly,  is  quite  clear.  Other points, however,  remain  for\r\n\r\nconsideration - especially with regard to the medium  to  longer\r\n\r\nterm  view,  but also on the possible effects of what Government\r\n\r\nwill do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is necessary because, as DPM reminded us,\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness is much more than cost-cutting.   It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsingle  attribute, but a combination of different elements.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  only a question of economics or infrastructure, but  it\r\n\r\nhas human dimensions, such as education, skill and know-how, the\r\n\r\nflexibility  of  our  system and the quality  of  life  and  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  in  our city.  Competitiveness is not  an  absolute\r\n\r\ncharacteristic but a comparative one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this debate, one detail will tend to dominate\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  whether in this House or in the coffeeshops.   This\r\n\r\nis the CPF and wage cut.  The cut will touch us all.  It is here\r\n\r\nand  now, whereas many of the recommendations of the Report  are\r\n\r\nfor the longer term, and therefore more abstract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the CPF cut and wage cut may seem like a\r\n\r\nmagic  bullet.  I doubt this is the intention and I am  sure  it\r\n\r\nwill  not be the effect.  I am glad therefore that DPM  Lee  has\r\n\r\nput   the   cut  and  other  cost-cutting  measures  in   proper\r\n\r\nperspective.  They give our companies breathing space, but  only\r\n\r\na regional and global recovery will ensure our future growth and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, in making my comments on the Report, I wish to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  three main areas.  Two are more immediate, while  the\r\n\r\nthird is for the medium to longer term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the effect of the cut: can it have unintended\r\n\r\nconsequences?   Second,  the question of  equity:  how  are  the\r\n\r\nsacrifices distributed?  Third, other concerns: what else do  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  do  to  complement the strategies in  the  Report  for\r\n\r\nincreasing competitiveness?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut to wages will make people feel poorer. They would\r\n\r\nbe  even  more reluctant to spend.  Domestic demand may well  go\r\n\r\ndown.   When  our shops are empty, or filled only  with  window-shoppers,  our business confidence will be affected.   As  such,\r\n\r\nthere is a danger of a deflationary spiral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, our Senior Minister Lee warned against us\r\n\r\nover-reacting to the crisis by saving too much and  cutting  all\r\n\r\nour  expenditure.  In the same vein, at the off-Budget measures,\r\n\r\na  number of us called for greater efforts to stimulate  demand.\r\n\r\nThe  cut to wages does the opposite.  It is akin to an austerity\r\n\r\nmeasure for every citizen and wage earner.  Even the IMF is  now\r\n\r\nre-thinking of austerity measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economists tell us that Singapore depends two-thirds on\r\n\r\nexternal  demand and only one-third on local demand.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  do not advise pump-priming.  But even so, it seems  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  many  small businesses depend largely or almost wholly  on\r\n\r\ndomestic  demand -  our shops in HDB estates and  Orchard  Road,\r\n\r\nour   hairdressers  and  barbers,  our  professionals  and   car\r\n\r\nmechanics, our restaurants and food courts.  As such, while  the\r\n\r\nabsolute  effect  may be one-third, it can  spread  across  many\r\n\r\nsectors  and many people and smaller businesses.  If  so,  pump-priming our domestic demand will not help a large amount, but it\r\n\r\ncan  help quite a number of people.  I would like the Minister's\r\n\r\nclarification on this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should act to keep people in our shopping centres and\r\n\r\nrestaurants. We should act to keep a bounce in their  step.   We\r\n\r\nshould keep Singapore a city with a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuzz,  confident  that  we  will continue  to  be  a  centre  of\r\n\r\nopportunity.   I  believe  this  proposed  cut  to   wages   may\r\n\r\nunintentionally do the opposite.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question of \"either or\". We can do both. We\r\n\r\ncan  have  the  cuts to wages as well as a package to  stimulate\r\n\r\ndemand.   We  can  lower cost of living or  income  tax  through\r\n\r\nrebates.  Lowering the cost of living in tandem with lower wages\r\n\r\nwill lessen the pain people will feel.  It will leave some spare\r\n\r\ncash in their pockets.  This would feel good for the people  and\r\n\r\nbe good for the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second unintended consequence of the cut that I fear\r\n\r\nmay be our ability to attract and retain talent.  Much attention\r\n\r\nhas been given to the cost of manufacturing as compared to other\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the  region.  But the  Report  itself  calls  for\r\n\r\nservices  to  be  a twin engine of growth.  For services,  other\r\n\r\ncomparisons  may  be more appropriate.  It is common  talk  that\r\n\r\nwages  are higher in Hong Kong for some professionals, that  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  on personal income tax is lower, and the corporate  tax\r\n\r\nis  lower.  For research and development, another area that  the\r\n\r\nReport recommends, there are other comparisons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether Singapore is\r\n\r\ncompeting with the right countries for the right kinds  of  jobs\r\n\r\nand  the  right sectors.  Our competitive position  should  take\r\n\r\ninto account not only the economy as a whole, but the benefit of\r\n\r\nindividuals  living here.  After all, it is not only investments\r\n\r\nthat  can  move  from one country to another, but  also  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is my concern that with the cut, our  ability  to\r\n\r\nattract  foreign talents here, which the Report calls for,  will\r\n\r\nbe  unintentionally eroded.  Worse, our ability  to  retain  our\r\n\r\nexisting talents may also weaken.  We need to have talented  and\r\n\r\nknowledgeable  professionals, for these would be the  foundation\r\n\r\nof  a  knowledge-based economy, and this will  mean paying  them\r\n\r\nworld class wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the second question of equity. Many are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  how the cuts and sacrifices  are  distributed.\r\n\r\nThe statistics show that Government charges are smaller than the\r\n\r\nwage component,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nonly  some 10%.  But perceptions differ.  The old joke  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  Government means Pay-And-Pay.  This  demonstrates  the\r\n\r\nstrength   of  that  perception.   Unless  we  deal  with   this\r\n\r\nperception, people will not willingly accept their share of  the\r\n\r\nsacrifice.   Instead, there may be a palpable  resentment  among\r\n\r\nsome sectors about what they see, rightly or wrongly, as an iron\r\n\r\nrice bowl in the civil service and in Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we tackle this perception? Ideally, we need\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised  monitoring.  Unlike the wage  cut,  there  is\r\n\r\nless immediate impact from other cost-saving measures.  This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly where measures are given indirectly.  For  example,\r\n\r\nwhere  relief is given to landlords, we should know how much  of\r\n\r\nthis is eventually passed on to the tenants and others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need to check Government influence on costs.\r\n\r\nMany  others have spoken about GST, maid levy, ERP, etc.  I will\r\n\r\nnot add to the wish list, since all the goodies we are going  to\r\n\r\nget  have  already been handed out by DPM Lee.  I  may  want  to\r\n\r\nraise more general concerns.  It is a good and timely move  that\r\n\r\nJTC  and  HDB will re-look at industrial land costs.   But  what\r\n\r\nabout  other  types of land, such as offices,  retail  and  even\r\n\r\nresidential  property  costs?  We  should  benchmark  all  these\r\n\r\nagainst global competition, of course accepting our constraints.\r\n\r\nOther areas the Government must look into are telecommunications\r\n\r\nand  electricity.   Monopolies always  have  the  temptation  to\r\n\r\nextract the maximum amount from their captive audience.  We  are\r\n\r\nopening  up  these sectors eventually to competition.   DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nsaid  yesterday, as regards SingTel, Government must honour  its\r\n\r\ncommitment  for its monopoly licence.  Fair enough.   But  until\r\n\r\nthe   day  the  competition  comes,  the  regulation  of   these\r\n\r\nmonopolies must serve to bring the costs to competitive  levels.\r\n\r\nThis,  in  the  longer run, is for the good of  these  companies\r\n\r\nthemselves if they are truly to be world class companies, as the\r\n\r\nReport aspires to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can make a more general point from this. How do we grow\r\n\r\nthe world class companies?  Our strategy cannot be to grant GLCs\r\n\r\nor  any  one else fat monopolies in Singapore, so that they  can\r\n\r\nextract  excessive profits here, and then venture overseas  with\r\n\r\ndeep  pockets  drawn from our money.  We must ask the  companies\r\n\r\nthat  wish to be world class to be lean and competitive, so that\r\n\r\nboth  their operations here and abroad are world class and  give\r\n\r\nvalue for money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third point is about Government statutory boards. I\r\n\r\nunderstand some statutory boards are in the habit of running  up\r\n\r\nsurpluses  and  yesterday I asked DPM  Lee  if  these  could  be\r\n\r\nreviewed and cut.  He explained that some statutory boards, like\r\n\r\nthe  JTC, must make surpluses because they need to get the  best\r\n\r\nvalue  for  state assets that they alienate.  I agree with  him.\r\n\r\nBut  there are other boards that are different, and I think  DPM\r\n\r\nalso  recognised  this.   I would ask that  for  such  different\r\n\r\nstatutory   boards,   the  surpluses  be  reviewed.    This   is\r\n\r\nparticularly for those who are supposed to facilitate  business.\r\n\r\nFor  such  business facilitation, surpluses do not  always  mean\r\n\r\nefficiency.  Rather, the surpluses may represent costs extracted\r\n\r\nfrom  businesses and individuals who have little choice  but  to\r\n\r\npay  the  sums  charged.  For Government  to  be  a  truly  good\r\n\r\nbusiness  facilitator, the policy should prefer  cost  recovery,\r\n\r\nrather  than generating surpluses.  We need to ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies are benchmarked to the best  practices.   I\r\n\r\nagree with that.  But Government agencies need to add value, not\r\n\r\nadd costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point on equity concerns the wage cut taken by our\r\n\r\npolitical leaders and top civil servants.  There is a joke about\r\n\r\npolitical leadership and sacrifice.  There is a plane with three\r\n\r\npoliticians on board - Gandhi, Churchill and a third leader,  Mr\r\n\r\nX.   There are also a number of ordinary citizens on board.  The\r\n\r\nplane is coming to a range of very high mountains, but the plane\r\n\r\nis  struggling to climb high enough to pass safely.   The  pilot\r\n\r\ninforms  everyone  that  they  may  crash  unless  the  load  is\r\n\r\nlightened.  They dump all the bags and cargo, but the  plane  is\r\n\r\nstill too heavy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this crisis, Gandhi opens the airplane door, shouts,\r\n\r\n\"For  My  People\" and jumps out.  With his sacrifice, the  plane\r\n\r\nlightens  a  bit  and  climbs a little.  But  not  enough.   So,\r\n\r\nChurchill looks around and goes to the door.  He shouts, \"For My\r\n\r\nPeople\" and jumps out.  Again, the plane climbs, but still it is\r\n\r\nnot  enough.   Finally, there is only the  third  leader  and  a\r\n\r\nnumber of ordinary citizens.  The third leader goes to the door,\r\n\r\nopens  it,  shouts, \"For My People\" and throws all the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee announced yesterday a 10% cut. I think that this\r\n\r\nis  enough to show that Singapore does not have leaders like the\r\n\r\nthird  man in the joke.  Still, many will ask, \"Is 10%  enough?\"\r\n\r\nPercentages  do matter and the public will judge for themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to ask is more a question of the system itself.   Is\r\n\r\nthe  system  we have of fixing ministerial salaries working?   I\r\n\r\nask this bearing in mind that this is the second year running in\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have  departed from the system.   DPM  Lee  yesterday\r\n\r\nsuggested  that it was a problem of time lag.  If so, I  suppose\r\n\r\nwe  can  fix by using more \"real time\" information about  wages.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would  like  the Government to consider  an  entire  re-thinking  of  the  system.   Perhaps instead  of  pegging  to  a\r\n\r\nhandful,  an elite, should the approach be to broad band?   This\r\n\r\ncould  be  to a larger percentile of wage earners and  it  could\r\n\r\nwell be more robust and politically acceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having outlined my concerns with unintended consequences\r\n\r\nand  equity, let me turn finally to other concerns.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\noutline  three concerns that, in my opinion, must be  allied  to\r\n\r\nthe question of competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to improve on natural resource efficiency.\r\n\r\nSir,  an important strategy in competitiveness is to be watchful\r\n\r\nover resource input.  If you can produce more from less, you are\r\n\r\nmore   efficient,   productive   and   competitive.    This   is\r\n\r\nparticularly  true  when you do not own or  have  automatic  and\r\n\r\nguaranteed  access  to  those inputs and resources.   There  are\r\n\r\nsound  reasons to be watchful over the use of natural  resources\r\n\r\nin Singapore, such as electricity and, especially, water.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Report mentions both.  The Report sees water and electricity\r\n\r\nas utilities that must be optimally managed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For water, the Report calls for Government incentives to be\r\n\r\npublicised.   As regards electricity, the Report  addresses  the\r\n\r\nquestion of charges for stand-by purposes.  For water, there are\r\n\r\na  few other strategies mentioned such as reducing wastage.  But\r\n\r\nmore can and should be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we can better publicise existing incentives, we may\r\n\r\nactually need to have better incentives to publicise.   We  also\r\n\r\nneed  to  re-look at the policy of pushing up the price.   Price\r\n\r\ncan  encourage greater efficiencies but only if it is undertaken\r\n\r\nin   a  context  that  increases  awareness  and  capacity,  and\r\n\r\nencourages  innovation  and  investment.   Otherwise,  a   price\r\n\r\nincrease  on its own simply leads to a price increase, and  that\r\n\r\nwill diminish competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of electricity. The cost is of real\r\n\r\nconcern  to businesses and households alike.  This is especially\r\n\r\ngiven  the  eventual  privatisation of  Singapore  Power.   With\r\n\r\nprivatisation,  there may come a need to increase  profits.   If\r\n\r\nprofits  are  tied  solely to the selling of  electricity,  then\r\n\r\nthere  is no incentive for Singapore Power or any other supplier\r\n\r\nto    be   concerned   about   efficiency,   productivity    and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  It will simply try to sell more power for more\r\n\r\nmoney  and  profit.   This  will  lead  to  a  less  competitive\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many reasons to embrace policies that will\r\n\r\nencourage  greater  efficiency in the use of natural  resources.\r\n\r\nPart  of  these  reasons are environmental.   But  part  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons are also economic.  Using off-the-shelf technology, some\r\n\r\ncompanies  are now reporting that they have achieved  what  they\r\n\r\ncall,  \"Factor Four\", that is, they double income, while halving\r\n\r\nresource  use.   These  private sector innovations  need  to  be\r\n\r\nstudied  and understood.  They can then serve as best  practices\r\n\r\nthat we should encourage others to adopt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has an inter-agency committee to examine\r\n\r\nenergy use in Singapore.  I hope that they will have one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  water.  And I hope that the Government will task this agency\r\n\r\nto  look  particularly  at the question of  competitiveness  and\r\n\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing that we need to ally competitiveness to is\r\n\r\nto  increase  our cooperation.  The thrust of the Report  is  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  internal factors of competitiveness.  We  must  not\r\n\r\nforget,  however, the Report is coming amidst a  crisis  of  the\r\n\r\nregion.  In fact, it is this regional dimension that has delayed\r\n\r\nthe  Report  and forced it to focus on reducing costs  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nother countries.  While it is Singapore's right to cut costs, we\r\n\r\nmust guard against an intended perception.  This is that we  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  out-compete other countries in  a  negative  manner.\r\n\r\nThat  is  to  say, we are cutting costs, so that we  will  steal\r\n\r\ninvestments  from our neighbours and force them to  lower  their\r\n\r\ncosts, or to devalue their currencies again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe this is our intention. Nor do I believe\r\n\r\nit  is in our interest to do so.  We cannot be seen to create  a\r\n\r\nrace  to the bottom.  Our cost-cutting should not be seen  as  a\r\n\r\npolicy to beggar our neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore call upon our Government to now re-emphasise\r\n\r\nSingapore's  cooperation,  in tandem  with  the  Report  on  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  This aspect of cooperation is a theme  in  the\r\n\r\nReport.   It  recognises the external wing and the  need  to  go\r\n\r\nglobal,  as well as regional.  At pages 62 and 63 of the Report,\r\n\r\nit  recommends the continuation of strategic flagship  projects,\r\n\r\npromoting  tripartite cooperation to attract third countries  to\r\n\r\ninvest, and using Singapore as a centre for training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are important points that bear emphasis in the\r\n\r\npresent times.  The crisis has caused many Singaporean companies\r\n\r\nto lose money in the region.  When we talk of going global, some\r\n\r\nmay  fear  that this displaces our regional interest and  focus.\r\n\r\nRather,  I urge the Government to send a strong signal that  our\r\n\r\nglobal  diversification is not a retreat  from  regionalisation,\r\n\r\nbut  an addition and complement to that thrust.  The crisis  has\r\n\r\nalso  caused some other countries in the region to doubt whether\r\n\r\nthey will prosper from being\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopen  to  the  world economy, trade and investment.   There  are\r\n\r\nrumblings  of  autarchy  and  narrow  nationalism  in  different\r\n\r\ncountries.   This is especially the case in some countries  that\r\n\r\nwere newly opening themselves when the crisis hit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that we stand for the belief that free\r\n\r\ntrade  and  a  connection to the world economy can help,  rather\r\n\r\nthan  hurt.  Sir, it is timely for us to act on what we believe.\r\n\r\nWe  should  help  steady other countries in the  region  against\r\n\r\nthose  who would close their economies and borders.  We can  and\r\n\r\nshould  do this by helping them better understand economics  and\r\n\r\nthe ways of business, and increasing their capacity to cope.  We\r\n\r\nshould  share  our  experiences with them, and  help  train  and\r\n\r\norientate them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also help these countries to deal with more immediate\r\n\r\ndislocations caused by the crisis.  If asked, we should help our\r\n\r\nneighbours  with problems among their poorer and less  well-off.\r\n\r\nThere  is  just so much a little red dot can do,  as  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has aptly said, but what we can do, we should  do.   In\r\n\r\nthis  respect, I have asked from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nhow much development assistance Singapore had given to its ASEAN\r\n\r\nneighbours  in  the last 18 months, that is,  since  the  crisis\r\n\r\nbegan.  The figure given by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  was\r\n\r\nsome  S$11.5 million, under the Singapore Cooperation Programme.\r\n\r\nI  call  on  the  Government to re-emphasise our  commitment  to\r\n\r\ncooperation  and to a win-win relationship with our  friends  in\r\n\r\nthe region by increasing this amount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not look to our immediate self-interests in doing\r\n\r\nthis.  We need to focus on the longer term interests inherent to\r\n\r\nwin-win  policies, and try to truly prosper our neighbours.   We\r\n\r\nneed   to  marry  our  sense  of  being  competitive  with   our\r\n\r\nwillingness to be cooperative.  If we are tough enough to take a\r\n\r\ncut  during these bad times, we should also be caring enough  to\r\n\r\ngive  more during these tough times, and this will send a strong\r\n\r\nsignal of our cooperation, and our neighbourliness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and final point I turn to is that of heartware. Last\r\n\r\nyear,  PM  Goh  spoke about the need to develop heartware.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore  21 Committee, of which I am a member, has spent  this\r\n\r\nlast  year  consulting  the  citizens  and  thinking  about  the\r\n\r\nquestions of heartware.  Some have wondered why this work should\r\n\r\nconcern  Singaporeans now when the crisis makes us  worry  about\r\n\r\nthe  here and now, rather than 21st century.  Yet I do not think\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  heartware is important, despite  the  crisis.\r\n\r\nHeartware is important because of the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the longer term strategies in the Report, I see\r\n\r\nareas  in which heartware is the critical component.  One aspect\r\n\r\nis  how  we  attract  foreign  talents,  while  taking  care  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, we must help Singaporeans excel and compete. We\r\n\r\nmust  also  attract  talent from abroad, by being  an  open  and\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan city-society.  By \"cosmopolitan\", I do not mean  we\r\n\r\nshould  read Cosmopolitan magazine, but rather that we allow  an\r\n\r\nactive engagement and interaction of people and values.  We need\r\n\r\nto  facilitate foreign talent to come into Singapore, by  easing\r\n\r\nbureaucratic  impediments, and should increase  interaction  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  between  Singaporeans and  foreign  talents  that\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second aspect of heartware is how we, as a people, strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  external wing of globalisation while remaining Singaporean.\r\n\r\nThis  requires a sense of rootedness.  It requires us to develop\r\n\r\na  sense of being Singaporean and yet also  being \"world  ready\"\r\n\r\nso  that  we  can go out and compete to \"plug-and-play\"  on  any\r\n\r\nstage in the world.  Our companies and families must accept  and\r\n\r\neven  promote overseas stints as a feather in the cap of workers\r\n\r\nand  family  members.   Government should remove  hindrances  to\r\n\r\ngoing  overseas, such as the lack of double taxation  agreements\r\n\r\nand  concerns  over  children's schooling.  Government  agencies\r\n\r\nshould  keep  in  touch  with  those  abroad  and  foster  their\r\n\r\nknowledge and stake in what happens here at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we develop a Singapore heartbeat, a sense of belonging, no\r\n\r\nmatter  where  we  find  ourselves,  this  will  strengthen  our\r\n\r\neconomic external wing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the question of heartware is important to competitiveness\r\n\r\nbecause  it  includes  fostering creativity and  resourcefulness\r\n\r\namong our people.  We need to be a society in which there  is  a\r\n\r\nsecond  chance for people, and in which everyone  counts.   Only\r\n\r\nthen  will  people be entrepreneurial, and be  willing  to  take\r\n\r\nrisks,  and  to  be different.  And only then can  we  be  truly\r\n\r\ncompetitive.     Differentiation   is   important.     As    one\r\n\r\nentrepreneur, Y Y Wong, reminded me recently, competitiveness on\r\n\r\nprice  matters most when you have the same product.  But if  you\r\n\r\nare  different, and people recognise your product is  different,\r\n\r\nyou can command that extra dollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You then compete, but with an edge. And I think that is the\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness that Singapore should seek - to  be  competitive\r\n\r\nbut to be different and to add value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments and qualifications, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, speaking on the CSC Report after the grand and masterly\r\n\r\nintervention by DPM BG Lee yesterday, it is like an anti-climax.\r\n\r\nIt  is  like  coming to a cinema show soon after  the  hero  has\r\n\r\nswiftly  moved in to save the heroine in distress.   The  saving\r\n\r\ngrace, however, is that after `the hero lai-lo' scene, we can at\r\n\r\nleast still say, \"Some money back, please.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean is that, yes, this is a major exercise at cost\r\n\r\ncutting, as it should be, if we are serious about retaining  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  but the Government has shown  enough  care  to\r\n\r\nprovide sufficient rebates and reductions in taxes and levies to\r\n\r\ngive  Singaporeans the cushion they deserve for their collective\r\n\r\nsense of sacrifice and effort at overcoming the challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we all know that this is no laughing matter. In\r\n\r\nshort,  this is no wayang.  The stakes are high.  Our  continued\r\n\r\nprosperity  and  social  well being as a  cohesive  multi-racial\r\n\r\nnation  depend  on  whether  we can pull  our  economic  strings\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the CSC understands this fully, as\r\n\r\nreflected  in  its approach, strategies and recommendations  for\r\n\r\nboth  the short and longer term.  Competition will grow  and  we\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  a lot to lose in terms of  our  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving and quality of life if we were not prepared to face this,\r\n\r\nin  the words of DPM Lee, \"gravest challenge since independence\"\r\n\r\nsquarely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chairman of the CSC, Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  Mr Lee Yock Suan, who is also my chief at  Cheng  San\r\n\r\nGRC,  is  very well known for his soft- spokenness.  Mr  Lee  is\r\n\r\nalso  a  man  of  few  words.  He believes in  gentle  but  firm\r\n\r\ndiplomacy.   But  the  CSC  Report  by  him  and  his  respected\r\n\r\nCommittee speaks volumes, and `loud and clear' of what Singapore\r\n\r\nneeds  to  do  to  remain competitive.  We  all  know  that  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  Singapore  faces in the immediate  and  longer  term\r\n\r\nfuture    are    formidable   but   if   the    well-thought-out\r\n\r\nrecommendations  were to be implemented, and  implemented  fast,\r\n\r\nthey should stand us in good stead.  PM Goh Chok Tong's positive\r\n\r\nresponse to the Report to \"ask the relevant Ministries to follow\r\n\r\nup   promptly   on   these  recommendations\"   is   also   worth\r\n\r\nhighlighting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comprehensive recommendations for the short and longer\r\n\r\nterm  notwithstanding,  we  have  already  heard  voices  asking\r\n\r\nwhether  the Report had gone far enough to prepare  us  for  the\r\n\r\nreal  challenges.   Some, as reflected in the media,  have  even\r\n\r\nexpressed  disappointment.  These sentiments are not necessarily\r\n\r\nbad.   There will always be those who will want Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nbe  pushed  to the limits.  Such are the demands of  the  times,\r\n\r\nespecially in this highly competitive world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example will be the concern whether enough will be done\r\n\r\nto produce Singapore's own world class players and corporations.\r\n\r\nI  think PSA is a good example of a corporation which is pushing\r\n\r\nhard  to  be one and is making good progress, but can we  really\r\n\r\nsee  more?   More  therefore could be done to help  produce  our\r\n\r\nworld  class  corporations to compete in this highly competitive\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not intend to go into the nuts and\r\n\r\nbolts  of  the Report nor the package presented by  DPM  BG  Lee\r\n\r\nyesterday,  but  instead  go to the spirit  of  the  matter.   I\r\n\r\nremember, earlier this year, when some of us in this House  were\r\n\r\npushing  for  the  Government to do more to  assist  the  ailing\r\n\r\neconomy, the latter initially resisted for fear of over-alarming\r\n\r\nthe  people.   Confidence was and is a premium in difficult  and\r\n\r\nturbulent  times.  Even when the $2 billion off-Budget  measures\r\n\r\nwere  announced,  some felt that they could be \"too  little  too\r\n\r\nlate\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time around, when the CSC proposed a cost-cutting package of $10 billion, the Government went a step\r\n\r\nfurther  with another $500 million cut.  This must be  for  good\r\n\r\nreasons.   This  will in no doubt emphasise the gravity  of  the\r\n\r\nchallenge,  but not without the `cushion effect' for those  that\r\n\r\nneed  help  most, especially the lower income groups.   This  is\r\n\r\ncommendable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also interesting to note that the CSC was in fact\r\n\r\nestablished in May last year before the July regional  meltdown.\r\n\r\nHere,  I am reminded of a Malay saying, \"sediakan payung sebelum\r\n\r\nhujan\"  (or  have your umbrella ready before it  rains).   This,\r\n\r\nafter  all, is true to what Singapore is well-known for:  to  be\r\n\r\nforward looking and we always have to be a few steps ahead.   We\r\n\r\ncertainly  would not want to be caught flat footed.   Especially\r\n\r\nwhen the thunderstorm clouds (not just rain clouds) were already\r\n\r\ngathering  over  the  horizon.   And  if  I  may  add,  ordinary\r\n\r\numbrellas will not do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the challenges facing us call for a\r\n\r\nconcerted  effort by all parties concerned.  I am glad  to  see,\r\n\r\nSir, that it even moved your Deputy and Member for Marine Parade\r\n\r\nGRC, Mr Eugene Yap, to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspeak.  Almost lyrical, on Monday Mr Yap spoke of the dangers of\r\n\r\ncomplacency and endorsed what he called worthy kiasuism.   While\r\n\r\nhe  used `the infamous Titanic' to illustrate, allow me  to  use\r\n\r\nthe Maldivian `dhoni' or boat to make my point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This modest fishing boat is the saving grace for the\r\n\r\nMaldivians who know what it means to survive in the atols of the\r\n\r\nIndian   Ocean.   I  was  there  earlier  this  month  for   the\r\n\r\nInauguration  of the President, President Maumoon Abdul  Gayoom,\r\n\r\nand  I have learnt how they, a population of about 260,000, have\r\n\r\ntransformed  the  seafaring nation to that of  a  niche  tourist\r\n\r\ndestination known the world over.  I think we have  two  of  our\r\n\r\ncompanies, Banyan Tree and HPL, having their own very  exclusive\r\n\r\ntourist  resorts there.  Without even fresh water, each  of  the\r\n\r\nmajor  Maldivian tourist island resort has its own  desalination\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  make the industry succeed.  Yes,  most  of  them\r\n\r\nstill turn to the dhoni, their own traditional boat, and the sea\r\n\r\nto earn a living but they also know that those skills alone will\r\n\r\nnot  suffice.  Air travel and speedboats now rule the waters  of\r\n\r\nthe tourist lanes of the Maldives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the proud Maldivians see\r\n\r\nSingapore's  drive  and competitive instincts  as  a  source  of\r\n\r\ninspiration.   They  know what survival  means.   Our  Singapore\r\n\r\nworkers  too  know  what survival means.   When  sacrifices  are\r\n\r\nneeded, they would not hesitate to rally to the call.  And  this\r\n\r\nis not the first time the workers have shown their mettle.  Yes,\r\n\r\nto  quote DPM BG Lee again, \"tough times put our mettle  to  the\r\n\r\ntest\"  and  our  workers  were and are the  first  to  show  it.\r\n\r\nWhether  it  is  the cut in employers' CPF contributions,  other\r\n\r\nwage  costs and training and retraining, the NTUC and the unions\r\n\r\nare with the Government and the Singapore people.  Difficult  as\r\n\r\nthey   may  be,  the  workers  know  the  realities,   for   the\r\n\r\nalternatives, more retrenchment and unemployment, would even  be\r\n\r\nmore painful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while acknowledging the workers' sacrifice, I hope the\r\n\r\nemployers  would  also  do their part.  Yes,  there  are  enough\r\n\r\nemployers   who  have  shown  that  they  too  are  responsible.\r\n\r\nCompliments are also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndue  to  those  who have shown their care for the  workers,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  Creative Technology, which has promised to return  the\r\n\r\nCPF  savings when the company does well.  But I hope that  there\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  those which are only too eager  to  exploit,  or\r\n\r\nworse,  to  abuse  the situation.  For the latter,  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  expose  them.  The Government, together with  the  NTUC,\r\n\r\nshould monitor the private sector to ferret out such abuses  and\r\n\r\nexpose them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure pragmatic Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nagree  that  the cost cutting measures recommended  in  the  CSC\r\n\r\nReport  and  those  presented by the  Government  yesterday  are\r\n\r\nnecessary.   And  so  are the numerous other strategic  measures\r\n\r\nrecommended by the CSC to overcome the crisis.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no short cut to staying competitive.  Our  companies,\r\n\r\nemployers  and workers realise that we must be a cut  above  the\r\n\r\nothers  in  order  to compete.  But we have  to  do  it  with  a\r\n\r\ncollective sense of purpose.  Show and convince our workers that\r\n\r\nthe  measures  taken  are equitable  and  fair.   It  may  be  a\r\n\r\npainstaking exercise but it has to be done patiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems faced by those workers who are retrenched and\r\n\r\nterminated  are  real.   While  there  are  ample  training  and\r\n\r\nretraining opportunities, the process will take time  and  there\r\n\r\nmay  be  practical  problems faced  by  the  workers  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies which need careful handling.  In short, while  the  CSC\r\n\r\nReport  and the Government statement yesterday say a  lot  about\r\n\r\nwhat must be done, let us do it with care, with a heart.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  just  a matter of dollars and cents, but a human face  too.\r\n\r\nEqually  important to the nuts and bolts of the  recommendations\r\n\r\nand  the action lines, is the right spirit to make it work.  Our\r\n\r\nSingapore spirit of success but in harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  since Monday, about 35 hon. Members have spoken on perhaps\r\n\r\ntwice  as many issues and concerns of Singaporeans arising  from\r\n\r\nthis economic downturn and recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise to speak in support of the motion but I will confine\r\n\r\nmy  remarks  to  areas impinging on the Ministry  of  Manpower's\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  and the recommendations of  the  Committee  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's   Competitiveness   where   it   touches   on    the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of my Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, DPM Lee had explained that we are facing\r\n\r\nthe  most  severe  economic crisis since our independence.   The\r\n\r\ndrop  in demand from our regional trading partners who were more\r\n\r\nseverely  hit  by the regional economic crisis  had  dimmed  our\r\n\r\ngrowth  prospects.  The regional currency realignment  had  also\r\n\r\naffected   our  share  of  the  global  market.   Recession   is\r\n\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the downturn in the economy has led to a deterioration\r\n\r\nof  the  employment situation in Singapore.  In the  first  nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of  this  year,  more  than  20,000  workers  had   been\r\n\r\nretrenched.  This is more than twice the number of workers  laid\r\n\r\noff  for  the whole of 1997 and is also higher than  the  19,500\r\n\r\nworkers  who  were  retrenched  during  our  last  recession  in\r\n\r\n1985/86.   We have also suffered the first contraction in  total\r\n\r\nemployment  since the last recession in 1985 over the  last  two\r\n\r\nquarters.  Sir, the total unemployment rate had risen from  2.3%\r\n\r\nin  June  this  year  to  4 1/2% in September  this  year  on  a\r\n\r\nseasonally adjusted basis, indicating an increase in momentum in\r\n\r\nthe rise of unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has introduced many initiatives to help\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers.   We have expanded our  Employment  Service\r\n\r\nDepartment  as  an  additional channel  to  help  retrenched  or\r\n\r\nunemployed Singaporeans to look for alternative jobs.   We  have\r\n\r\nalso  formed a proactive Employment Facilitation Team  to  reach\r\n\r\nout  to employers in various sectors to determine their manpower\r\n\r\nrequirements in the near future and to help them with strategies\r\n\r\nto  fill  their  job  vacancies with appropriate  manpower.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, we seek out employers who are still recruiting so as\r\n\r\nto  capture  their vacancies in our job bank.  In this  way,  we\r\n\r\nhave been able to provide as many as 80%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the registrants at our Employment Service Department with at\r\n\r\nleast  one  job referral.  If a registrant is not successful  in\r\n\r\ngetting the job in the first instance, we have been able to make\r\n\r\nfollow-up referrals to him.  We have also created a Retrenchment\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Unit  (RAU) to help employers cope with  the  need  to\r\n\r\ndownsize as demand for their goods and services shrink.  The RAU\r\n\r\nhas  already  helped  employers  to  introduce  alternatives  to\r\n\r\noutright   retrenchment,   laying  off   workers   directly   by\r\n\r\nintroducing  shorter  work week, temporary lay-off  and  putting\r\n\r\nexcess manpower on training programmes and also working out  how\r\n\r\nthey  could reduce wage costs by reduction of the flexible  wage\r\n\r\ncomponent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these measures cannot solve the problem of rising\r\n\r\nunemployment   in  this  recession.   Already  the   number   of\r\n\r\nregistrants at the ESD has exceeded available vacancies,  unlike\r\n\r\nin the past when we used to have more than twice as many jobs as\r\n\r\njob seekers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can we do in response to this sudden change in\r\n\r\neconomic  climate?   Obviously,  we  cannot  insulate  ourselves\r\n\r\ncompletely  from  the chill winds of recession sweeping  through\r\n\r\nthe region.  We are already in fact feeling the first twinge  of\r\n\r\nthe   biting   cold  brought  about  by  the  external   forces.\r\n\r\nUnemployment  has,  as I said, reached 4.5%  in  September  this\r\n\r\nyear.   This  is  nearly 2.5 times higher than  a  year  ago  in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1997.  We have to revitalize our economic  engine  in\r\n\r\norder to get us out of the woods.  The CSC's comprehensive study\r\n\r\nhas  made  it  clear  that our business cost  is  now  too  high\r\n\r\ncompared  to  our  competitors, as  a  result  of  the  regional\r\n\r\ncurrency  and economic crisis.  We are no longer competitive  in\r\n\r\nareas where our neighbours are also vying for market share.   We\r\n\r\nmust  bring business cost back in line to survive this  downturn\r\n\r\nand  to  avoid more painful setbacks such as higher unemployment\r\n\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th October 1998, the Straits Times published a table\r\n\r\ncompiled  by  the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU)  showing  the\r\n\r\ncost of doing business in Singapore versus Hong Kong, Indonesia,\r\n\r\nMalaysia\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  Thailand.  The EIU concluded that regionally, Singapore was\r\n\r\nthe  \"most expensive country to do business in\".  We were  rated\r\n\r\neven  more  expensive  than Hong Kong.   What  was  particularly\r\n\r\nstriking was our wage cost, which was shown to be as much as 1.7\r\n\r\ntimes  that  of  Hong  Kong, 4.4 times  Malaysia  and  15  times\r\n\r\nThailand.   The  hourly  cost  of  labour  in  manufacturing  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia was only one-twenty-third of that in Singapore.  While\r\n\r\nSingapore need not compete on low cost labour because  we  offer\r\n\r\ninvestors and businessmen many other advantages for operating in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we also cannot completely disregard this sudden swing\r\n\r\nin   the   region   which  has  severely  eroded   our   overall\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  The decline in demand and the higher costs  of\r\n\r\noperations  in Singapore could lead to bigger losses  in  market\r\n\r\nshare for Singapore.  If we do not tackle this problem, it  will\r\n\r\ncause  even  more retrenchments and higher unemployment  in  the\r\n\r\nyears ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM Lee has pointed out, total wages and salaries paid\r\n\r\nto  workers are a key component of GDP output amounting to  43%.\r\n\r\nWhereas  indirect  taxes paid to Government represent  only  10%\r\n\r\nwhile  profits  to  companies take  up  the  rest  of  47%.   So\r\n\r\nobviously  any measure to reduce cost of doing business  and  to\r\n\r\nenhance  competitiveness must involve adjustments to  wages  and\r\n\r\nsalaries,   apart   from  reducing  the  indirect   taxes   from\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This is a pragmatic and an effective approach.   By\r\n\r\ndoing  so, we will be signalling to international investors  and\r\n\r\nemployers that Singaporeans are adaptable and pragmatic.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot  cry over spilled milk but get down quickly to build up lost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and regain market share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the approach adopted by the Committee on\r\n\r\nSingapore's Competitiveness (CSC).  I applaud the Committee  for\r\n\r\nits courage in facing up to the realities and not flinching from\r\n\r\nprescribing  bitter medicines.  The Committee had recommended  a\r\n\r\n10%  point reduction in the employer's CPF contribution rate  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  a  cut in wages to achieve a total 15% reduction.   On\r\n\r\nCPF, DPM Lee had already\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nannounced  yesterday  that  the  Government  accepts  the  CSC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation and to minimise the impact on homeowners who  are\r\n\r\nusing  their   CPF savings or contributions to service  mortgage\r\n\r\nloans, 6% point of the cut would come from the Ordinary Account.\r\n\r\nContribution   to  the  Special  Account  would  completely   be\r\n\r\nsuspended.   In  other  words, the 4% point  that  goes  to  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account will be cut off. For example, a person  earning\r\n\r\n$2,000 a month would see a drop of $120 in CPF savings available\r\n\r\nfor mortgage repayment and not $200 which is the actual size  of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  reduction for a person earning $2,000.  As CPF members\r\n\r\nand  their families may need to utilize their Medisave  to  meet\r\n\r\ntheir medical expenses even in an economic downturn, there is no\r\n\r\nneed for us to reduce the Medisave contribution rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older workers above the age of 55 whose current\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates  are  lower, the  rates  will  also  be  cut\r\n\r\nproportionately by half as announced by DPM Lee.  In the case of\r\n\r\nemployees  above the age of 55 to age 60, their  employers'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate will be reduced from 7.5% to 4%  (a  round  up\r\n\r\nfrom  3.75%).  For employees above the age of 60 to  age  65,  I\r\n\r\nhave   previously   announced  that  existing   employers'   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate will be reduced from 7.5% to 4%  with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom 1st January 1999 as a result of the proposal to extend  the\r\n\r\nretirement  age  from 60 to 62.  Similarly, for employees  above\r\n\r\nthe  age of 65, their employers' CPF contribution rate will also\r\n\r\nbe  reduced  from 5% to 4% as a result of the extension  of  the\r\n\r\nretirement  age.   In line with the principle  of  proportionate\r\n\r\ncut, the CPF contribution rate for this group of workers will be\r\n\r\nreduced  to 2% from 4%.  As announced by DPM Lee the  cuts  will\r\n\r\ntake effect on 1st January 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 18% of active CPF members (or 217,057 active\r\n\r\nCPF  members) will have monthly CPF contributions that are  less\r\n\r\nthan  their monthly housing instalments as a result of the  cut.\r\n\r\nOut of these members, 165,661 are HDB owners, 46,446 are private\r\n\r\nproperty  owners  and  4,950 are concurrently  HDB  and  private\r\n\r\nproperty owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the affected CPF members, the Government will allow\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  savings in their Special Account, apart  from  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account, to meet the shortfall in their  monthly  loan\r\n\r\nrepayment arising from the CPF cut. In addition, there will also\r\n\r\nbe  separate assistance schemes to help HDB and private property\r\n\r\nowners tide over the difficulties of mortgage repayment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of HDB lessees, the HDB will put in place\r\n\r\nmeasures similar to those offered in the last economic downturn.\r\n\r\nThese  measures will benefit both lessees of existing HDB  flats\r\n\r\nas  well as affected applicants of new and resale flats.   These\r\n\r\nwill  include  allowing more working family  members  to  become\r\n\r\njoint  owners, thus using their CPF savings to meet the mortgage\r\n\r\nrepayment.  HDB will also reschedule mortgage loans to a  longer\r\n\r\nrepayment period, defer mortgage repayment and allowing  payment\r\n\r\nof   arrears  by  instalments  for  those  who  have   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  Applicants for new and resale flats will also  be\r\n\r\neligible  for  these  assistance schemes.  In  addition,  first-timers  with financial difficulties will be allowed to downgrade\r\n\r\nto a smaller flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of private properties purchased before the CPF\r\n\r\ncut,  the  Government will offer affected CPF members a Bridging\r\n\r\nLoan Scheme (BLS) similar to that provided in 1986.  The BLS  is\r\n\r\nfor  CPF  members who have depleted their Ordinary  Account  and\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account  savings for their monthly mortgage  repayment.\r\n\r\nThe  bridging  loan  will be made available  over  a  three-year\r\n\r\nperiod in the first instance, with the commencement of the first\r\n\r\ndraw down on 1st March 1999. The quantum of the monthly bridging\r\n\r\nloan drawn down will be capped at the amount of shortfall, which\r\n\r\narises directly from the cut of 6% point in the Ordinary Account\r\n\r\ncontribution rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the burden of mortgage repayment of CPF members\r\n\r\nduring  this recession, the bridging loan will be offered  at  a\r\n\r\nconcessionary  interest  rate based on CPF  interest  rate  plus\r\n\r\n0.1%.  This\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  significantly  lower than the commercial interest  rate  for\r\n\r\nhousing loans.  The cut-off age limit for the eligibility of the\r\n\r\nloan will be based on the minimum statutory retirement age of 62\r\n\r\nyears  which  will take effect on 1st January  1999.   Repayment\r\n\r\nwill commence one year after the end of the three year draw-down\r\n\r\nperiod, with full repayment to be made over a period of 10 years\r\n\r\nor by the age of 65, or upon the sale of the property, whichever\r\n\r\nis earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BLS will also be extended to HDB flat owners who are\r\n\r\npaying  market  interest  rate, and whose  flats  were  likewise\r\n\r\npurchased  before the CPF cut was announced.   The  market  rate\r\n\r\ncurrently applies to Permanent Residents, owners of resale flats\r\n\r\nwhose  household income exceeds $8,000 a month  and  third  time\r\n\r\npurchasers of HDB flats.  This is a separate group of  HDB  flat\r\n\r\nowners  who  are servicing their HDB loans at the interest  rate\r\n\r\npegged  to that of the Credit POSB's interest because they  have\r\n\r\nalready had their fair share of the housing subsidy.  As for HDB\r\n\r\nlessees who are currently enjoying concessionary interest  rates\r\n\r\n(which is CPF + 0.1%) for their outstanding mortgage loans, they\r\n\r\nneed not apply for the BLS as they can apply for HDB's financial\r\n\r\nassistance  package  at  the same concessionary  interest  rate.\r\n\r\nFurther  details  of  the BLS and the HDB  Financial  Assistance\r\n\r\nProgrammes will be released separately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is also aware that the cut in CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate will have an impact on CPF members  who  have\r\n\r\ncommitted their savings for insurance policies which they bought\r\n\r\npreviously or who are participants in the education loan scheme.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, they have borrowed against their CPF savings to\r\n\r\nfinance either their own education or their children's education\r\n\r\nin  institutes of higher learning. To ensure that such  payments\r\n\r\nare not disrupted, whether it is insurance or education, members\r\n\r\nwill  be  allowed  to set aside sufficient CPF savings  to  meet\r\n\r\nthese  payments  when they apply for the bridging  loan  or  for\r\n\r\nHDB's assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF cut will result in a wage saving of some $3.9\r\n\r\nbillion a year to employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  will help companies and the economy to regain and  improve\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  in  the  current economic  downturn.   The  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate  will be adjusted upwards  when  the  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers and when a higher rate of saving will not undercut  our\r\n\r\noverall competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foreign Worker Levy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to foreign worker levy. But before doing\r\n\r\nso, I should respond specifically to some points made by several\r\n\r\nMPs  including Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Peh Chin Hua.  They have\r\n\r\nsuggested that CPF members should be allowed to draw some amount\r\n\r\nof  money from their CPF savings during this downturn.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  very much to agree with the Members, particularly  Mr  Peh\r\n\r\nChin Hua, who is also my GRC colleague.  But on this occasion, I\r\n\r\nam  afraid that I have to disagree with him and the rest of  the\r\n\r\nMembers who have made this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always maintained that CPF savings may be released for\r\n\r\nliving  expenses  if  Singapore runs into a prolonged  and  deep\r\n\r\nrecession.   The  situation  today  is  certainly  not  in  this\r\n\r\ncategory.  We are not in a prolonged and deep recession as  yet.\r\n\r\nWhile  the economic challenges are more severe than any that  we\r\n\r\nhave  encountered previously, we should not quickly turn to  the\r\n\r\nCPF  account  to support the living expenses for the unemployed.\r\n\r\nMost  CPF  members are using their CPF savings to pay for  their\r\n\r\nhousing mortgages, as I have just explained earlier on.   As  it\r\n\r\nis,  with  the reduction in CPF contribution by 10% point,  many\r\n\r\nCPF  members  (217,000 of them) would have insufficient  CPF  to\r\n\r\ncontinue their monthly mortgage repayment.  If we in fact  allow\r\n\r\nCPF  members to draw from their CPF savings for living expenses,\r\n\r\nit  would  mean  that more CPF members would deplete  their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  faster  and  that  would create  a  bigger  problem  in\r\n\r\nservicing their home mortgages.  It may even cause some  of  the\r\n\r\nhome owners to have to lose their homes in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh has made a specific suggestion that we allow jobless\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to draw $150 from their CPF account to  tide  them\r\n\r\nover this period.  My response is that if $150 is what a jobless\r\n\r\nSingaporean  needs  for  himself  and  his  family,  the  better\r\n\r\nsolution  is  to  help him find a job.  We still  have  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  foreign workers in Singapore today, working  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and service sectors, earning anywhere  from  $500-$600  a month, doing many jobs which Singaporeans up to now  are\r\n\r\nreluctant to take on.  In a crunch, jobless Singaporeans may  be\r\n\r\nbetter  off  taking on similar jobs than relying  on  their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings to sustain themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do our best to help Singaporeans who are prepared to\r\n\r\ntake  on such jobs, provided they are realistic about wages  and\r\n\r\nthe   working   conditions.   Employers  should  also   consider\r\n\r\nattracting  unemployed  Singaporeans  by  making  use  of  their\r\n\r\nsavings  on  the  foreign worker levy when they employ  a  local\r\n\r\nworker.  This is, I believe, a far better approach than allowing\r\n\r\nthe unemployed to draw down on their CPF at this juncture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the danger of allowing CPF withdrawal at this early stage\r\n\r\nis  that  it  would  give some Singaporeans  a  false  sense  of\r\n\r\nsecurity.   They may be lulled into not reacting to the  changed\r\n\r\nlabour  market  situation and remain reluctant  to  accept  jobs\r\n\r\nwhich  pay less or are more onerous.  Some may even become  less\r\n\r\nwilling to go for skill upgrading and retraining, thinking  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  their  CPF savings that would tide  them  over  this\r\n\r\ndifficult period.  This mindset will only delay our recovery and\r\n\r\nmay  well result in a self-fulfilling prophesy.  In other words,\r\n\r\nif  we allow CPF withdrawal, we induce inertia to change and  to\r\n\r\nwork  harder.   As a result, we remain uncompetitive,  recession\r\n\r\ndeepens  and  more  and more people become unemployed.   So,  on\r\n\r\nbalance,  I  think  it  is  better for  us  to  help  unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   find   alternative  jobs,  and   for   unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to be prepared to take on more difficult  jobs  at\r\n\r\neven a lower pay.  The situation has changed.  These are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifficult times.  Tens of millions are unemployed in the  region\r\n\r\naround us.  We must be prepared to make drastic adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the foreign worker levy, the Committee has\r\n\r\nrecommended that the foreign worker levy be reduced as  a  means\r\n\r\nof  cutting cost of business.  DPM Lee yesterday also  announced\r\n\r\nGovernment's acceptance of this recommendation.  Let me say that\r\n\r\nthere  are now more than 450,000 foreign workers on work permits\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   This means unskilled and at  best  semi-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.  Many companies are still dependent on foreign  workers\r\n\r\nfor  jobs which locals do not want to do.  In particular, in the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector, many companies have to  rely  on  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers to fulfil part of their manpower requirements.  However,\r\n\r\nwhen we cut the foreign worker levy, we should be careful not to\r\n\r\nremove  the differential between local and foreign workers.   We\r\n\r\nshould not cut the levy to the extent that employers are tempted\r\n\r\nto  replace  Singaporeans with more and  more  foreign  workers.\r\n\r\nCutting  CPF  for local workers thus gives us an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nalso  lower  foreign worker levy without widening the  wage  gap\r\n\r\nbetween local and foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to recap, the levy for skilled workers will be reduced\r\n\r\nfrom  $100  to $30 for all sectors with effect from 1st  January\r\n\r\n1999.   This is a reduction coming on top of the $100  reduction\r\n\r\nwhich  was  implemented  in April this year.   In  other  words,\r\n\r\nwithin a period of less than a year, we have reduced the foreign\r\n\r\nworker levy for skilled workers by $170.  The levy for unskilled\r\n\r\nforeign workers will also be reduced by $90 with effect from 1st\r\n\r\nJanuary  1999.  This reduction will apply only to  companies  in\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing, marine and services sectors to enhance their\r\n\r\nexport competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy for unskilled foreign construction workers will\r\n\r\nnot  be reduced.  Construction is a domestic industry and is not\r\n\r\ndirectly  vulnerable  to  international  competition.    Overall\r\n\r\nconstruction costs have in fact come down for all building\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntypes  during this period.  The weighted Tender Price Index  has\r\n\r\nfallen by 4.5% in the first six months of this year, partly  due\r\n\r\nto falling material costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moreover, the construction sector has remained overly-dependent on unskilled foreign workers. This is the main cause\r\n\r\nfor  the  very low productivity of the sector.  The productivity\r\n\r\nlevel  of  our construction workforce lags far behind  those  in\r\n\r\ncountries such as Japan and Australia.  In terms of value  added\r\n\r\nper  worker in the construction industry, Australia is 1.5 times\r\n\r\nahead  while  Japan is three times that of Singapore.   For  the\r\n\r\nlast  three  consecutive  years,  productivity  growth  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  sector  has  been negative.   So  far  this  year,\r\n\r\nproductivity  growth for the sector has declined  by  a  further\r\n\r\n2.1%.    Hence,   since   1995,  the  productivity   level   for\r\n\r\nconstruction had actually gone down by more than 15%.   We  need\r\n\r\nto take a determined approach to upgrade the skills level of the\r\n\r\nconstruction  workforce in order to achieve  a  breakthrough  in\r\n\r\nproductivity.   That  is  why  we cannot  reduce  the  levy  for\r\n\r\nunskilled foreign construction workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy reduction for skilled foreign construction workers\r\n\r\nand  the increase in the levy for unskilled foreign construction\r\n\r\nworkers, which took effect in April of this year, have  in  fact\r\n\r\nresulted  in  improvement  in the quality  of  the  construction\r\n\r\nworkforce.   The  proportion of construction  workers  who  have\r\n\r\nobtained Skills Evaluation Certification rose from 12% in  April\r\n\r\nthis  year  to  16%  in October 1998.  To reduce  the  levy  for\r\n\r\nunskilled  construction workers now will undermine the  progress\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  achieved  in upgrading  the  workforce  and  the\r\n\r\nindustry.   Instead, we should provide more  incentives  to  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry to upgrade their workforce by widening the\r\n\r\ngap  between  employing  a  skilled  and  an  unskilled  foreign\r\n\r\nconstruction  worker.  That is why we are cutting the  levy  for\r\n\r\nthe skilled construction workers by another $70.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from productivity consideration, unskilled\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  are  the ones most vulnerable  to  abuses  and\r\n\r\nmalpractices.  We are aware of labour suppliers who collude with\r\n\r\ncontractors\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  cheat ignorant and unskilled foreign workers.  These workers\r\n\r\nhad  paid  agents  in their home countries  large  fees  on  the\r\n\r\npromise of well-paying jobs in Singapore.  Some end up abandoned\r\n\r\nwithout  a  job and accommodation shortly after they  arrive  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We have already taken various measures such  as  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the levy bond early this year and new allocation\r\n\r\nformula, to stem such abuses.  If we were to reduce the levy for\r\n\r\nunskilled  construction  workers  at  this  juncture,  it  could\r\n\r\nencourage  such  malpractice to grow,  bringing  more  unskilled\r\n\r\nforeign  workers into Singapore.  And this would result in  more\r\n\r\nsocial and law and order problems for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, the hon. Nominated Member, Mr Chuang,\r\n\r\ncommented  that  the  levy  differential  between  skilled   and\r\n\r\nunskilled  foreign workers had led to an unintended side  effect\r\n\r\nof   PRC  companies  having  an  unfair  advantage  over   local\r\n\r\nconstruction firms.  I believe I am correct in this  summing  up\r\n\r\nof  what  he said.  He said that because many of the workers  on\r\n\r\nthe  low  levy  are  PRC workers and they are  employed  by  PRC\r\n\r\nconstruction companies which are better able to manage them, and\r\n\r\nthat has given the PRC companies an advantage in Singapore.   In\r\n\r\nother words, our policy has resulted in an uneven playing field.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to correct the observation made by the\r\n\r\nNominated  Member, because I do not think that is reflective  of\r\n\r\nthe  industry  overall.  It may well have happened  that  a  PRC\r\n\r\ncompany  with skilled PRC workers had been able to tender  lower\r\n\r\nand  therefore  won some contracts, but I do  not  think  it  is\r\n\r\nreflective of the industry as a whole.  Because I would like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that the lower levy applies not only to skilled  PRC\r\n\r\nconstruction workers but also to skilled workers from all  other\r\n\r\nsources.  Our records, in fact, show that PRC workers constitute\r\n\r\nonly  a  minority of the number of construction workers  on  low\r\n\r\nlevy,  in  other  words, skilled workers.  Most of  the  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  on low levy come from Malaysia, our traditional  source\r\n\r\nof  supply of skilled workers, as well as other sources such  as\r\n\r\nIndia, Bangladesh, Thailand and Myanmar.  Since April this  year\r\n\r\nwhen we lowered\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  skilled  worker levy from $200 to $100, there has  been  an\r\n\r\nincreasing  number  of skilled construction workers  from  these\r\n\r\ncountries,  particularly from Malaysia, our traditional  source.\r\n\r\nWhen we subsequently implemented the 20% basic skill certificate\r\n\r\nrequirement  in August of this year, the proportion  of  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  from  other sources increased further, as  new  testing\r\n\r\ncentres were set up in these countries.  Hence, in the last  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  the proportion of PRC construction workers on low  levy\r\n\r\nhad, in fact, gone down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that the PRC construction\r\n\r\nworkers  are  not  solely  employed by  PRC  construction  firms\r\n\r\noperating  in  Singapore.  Our records  show  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nsizable number of non-PRC construction companies including local\r\n\r\ncontractors  that  employ  skilled  PRC  workers.   Hence,   PRC\r\n\r\nconstruction  firms do not have an unfair advantage  over  local\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has always actively encouraged construction\r\n\r\ncompanies   to   employ  skilled  foreign   workers.    If   PRC\r\n\r\nconstruction companies had benefited from the low levy, it shows\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  heeded our advice and  quickly  taken  up  the\r\n\r\ninitiative to employ more skilled foreign workers and to upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  skills of their existing workers.  Indeed, there is nothing\r\n\r\nto stop local construction companies from doing likewise.  Local\r\n\r\nconstruction companies are, in fact, in a better position to tap\r\n\r\nthe  pool of skilled construction workers from Malaysia, in view\r\n\r\nof  our  historic ties and closer proximity.  They can also  tap\r\n\r\nmany   other  sources  of  skilled  workers.   It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nunfortunate that some local construction firms, for reasons best\r\n\r\nknown to themselves, have continued to rely on large numbers  of\r\n\r\nunskilled foreign workers despite the many efforts by Government\r\n\r\nto  encourage  skills upgrading and productivity  gains.   These\r\n\r\ncompanies only have themselves to blame.  I would strongly  urge\r\n\r\nconstruction companies, both local and foreign, to  employ  more\r\n\r\nskilled  foreign  workers  or to upgrade  the  skills  of  their\r\n\r\nexisting workers, not only as a cost cutting measure but also to\r\n\r\nraise productivity and standard of the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, contractors should seize this opportunity with the\r\n\r\nreduction  on  the  skill levy to employ more  skilled  workers.\r\n\r\nThey would not only enjoy the substantial savings in levy, about\r\n\r\n$440  per  worker  per month, but also benefit from  the  higher\r\n\r\nproductivity of the skilled workers.  For Singapore as a  whole,\r\n\r\nit  would  also be beneficial as social problems are  minimised.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  approach  is consistent with our  long-term  goal  of\r\n\r\nreducing  the  number of unskilled foreign construction  workers\r\n\r\nand  to  enhancing construction productivity.  We are, in  fact,\r\n\r\nconducting a thorough and comprehensive review of how to achieve\r\n\r\nthis objective under our Construction 21 study.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for foreign domestic workers, many Members have spoken\r\n\r\non this subject and many Members have made passionate appeals on\r\n\r\nwhy the foreign domestic worker levy should be reduced.  DPM Lee\r\n\r\nyesterday  already  said  that the key  point   in  cutting  the\r\n\r\nforeign  worker  levy is to address export competitiveness.   We\r\n\r\nare  trying to help employers.  We are trying to help  companies\r\n\r\nreduce  cost of production so that their products can sell  well\r\n\r\nin  the international market place and, instead of losing market\r\n\r\nshare,  they can regain lost market share.  The foreign domestic\r\n\r\nworker  levy will not have an effect on the competitive position\r\n\r\nof  our  industries,  since  the foreign  domestic  workers  are\r\n\r\nemployed  by  the  households.  The levy  for  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworker  cannot  be  reduced at this juncture.   However,  as  an\r\n\r\noffset,  working mothers will continue to be able  to  claim  or\r\n\r\nenjoy  the double tax deduction for the foreign domestic  worker\r\n\r\nlevy  which  they  pay.   Several Members have  spoken  on  this\r\n\r\nearlier.   Dr  Vasoo  has suggested that  during  this  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis, it is not necessary to use the foreign worker levy as  a\r\n\r\nmeans of moderating the demand for foreign domestic workers.   I\r\n\r\nam  afraid that he is wrong on this score because, as it is, the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  foreign  domestic  workers  has  actually  increased\r\n\r\ndespite  the  economic downturn.  Yes, the rate of  increase  is\r\n\r\nlower  now  compared to past years. But the increase shows  that\r\n\r\nthe demand is still strong.  Hence, we still\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed  some  measure to moderate this demand to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  foreign  domestic  workers  does  not  grow  out  of\r\n\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the income of most of the households which employ\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic workers far exceeds the cost  of  employing  a\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic worker, including the levy.  It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nunlikely  that the current wage cut in the end-of-year  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent  would  seriously  affect the  employment  of  foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic  workers in many households.  Members may be interested\r\n\r\nto  know  that  more  than  80% of the households  which  employ\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic  workers have an income exceeding  $4,000  per\r\n\r\nmonth, not including the employer's CPF contribution.  Even with\r\n\r\nthe 5-8% cut in wages, these households should still be able  to\r\n\r\nretain their domestic workers if they want to do so.  There are,\r\n\r\nof  course, some marginal cases, whose incomes are lower.  There\r\n\r\nare  also  some employers who have been retrenched and  are  now\r\n\r\njobless.   But  I find it difficult to accept that even  jobless\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  able to continue to enjoy the  service  of  a\r\n\r\nforeign domestic worker. We have to be practical.  Losing a  job\r\n\r\nmeans  making  major  adjustment to one's  lifestyle,  including\r\n\r\ngetting down to domestic chores, if necessary.  Losing a job may\r\n\r\nwell  require us to make sacrifices in other areas.   We  cannot\r\n\r\ncontinue to assume that whether we have a job or whether we have\r\n\r\na pay increase or not, we should be able to afford and enjoy the\r\n\r\nservices of foreign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, cutting the foreign domestic worker levy will in\r\n\r\nfact  not  benefit the vast majority of low income families  who\r\n\r\nare  not employers of foreign domestic workers.  It is these low\r\n\r\nincome  families  who are most in need of Government  assistance\r\n\r\nand support during this period of downturn.  Government will, in\r\n\r\nfact,  introduce other measures to help the low income  families\r\n\r\ncope with the wage cut, as announced by DPM Lee yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in November 1997, my Ministry announced that the foreign\r\n\r\ndomestic worker levy will be adjusted annually.  We announced in\r\n\r\nNovember  last  year  that  we will  make  regular  reviews  and\r\n\r\nannounce\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  changes in November to take effect in the following  April.\r\n\r\nIn  view of the economic downturn and wage cut proposed for next\r\n\r\nyear, we have decided to suspend the levy revision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the NWC guidelines, DPM Lee has already announced\r\n\r\nGovernment's acceptance of the new NWC guidelines for 5-8%  wage\r\n\r\ncut.  Sir, our ability to reach this difficult decision with the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  workers  will  have a major  impact  on  investors'\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singapore.  It is a strong signal to investors and\r\n\r\nemployers  that our workers are willing to shoulder their  share\r\n\r\nof   the   burden   to   help  companies   retain   their   cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  This willingness to suffer  a  wage  cut  will\r\n\r\nhelp  many companies to weather the downturn.  It will  preserve\r\n\r\njobs  for  workers and minimise unemployment.  The NWC has  also\r\n\r\nrecommended that the wage reduction should as far as possible be\r\n\r\neffected  through  the variable component of the  flexible  wage\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduced the flexible wage system in the aftermath of the\r\n\r\n1985/86  recession, precisely in anticipation  of  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nproblems  that we are facing today.  Adjustments to the flexible\r\n\r\nwage  system  by  cutting variable components  would  have  less\r\n\r\nimpact on the monthly incomes of workers and should be easier to\r\n\r\nshoulder.  I urge the private sector employers to abide  by  the\r\n\r\nNWC  recommendations  to  make the  wage  cut  in  the  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent.   I  would  also  urge all employers  to  follow  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  example  and  apply  the  NWC  recommendations  to\r\n\r\nmoderate the wage cuts for the lower income employees.   Private\r\n\r\nsector employers should make a bigger wage cut for higher income\r\n\r\nexecutives and management staff and a smaller cut for the  lower\r\n\r\nincome   workers.    The  lower  income  employees   have   less\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  income  and  are more likely  to  suffer  greater\r\n\r\ndifficulty  coping  with  wage  reduction.   Applying  the   NWC\r\n\r\nrecommendations will help them to better weather this recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has also decided to make a cut in the\r\n\r\ncivil servants' monthly non-pensionable variable payment.   This\r\n\r\nmonthly variable payment is missing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  the private sector's wage structure.  We should study this\r\n\r\nfurther to see how the private sector can also benefit from such\r\n\r\na monthly variable component to achieve higher responsiveness to\r\n\r\nsudden  economic  changes.   Incorporating  a  monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent  in the flexible wage system may help to minimise  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  future  CPF reduction, which is a much  more  drastic\r\n\r\nmeasure  with  wider implications because people have  committed\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  savings for mortgage repayment and other  long  term\r\n\r\ncommitments such as insurance policies.  In fact, this has  been\r\n\r\nsuggested  by Mr Ahmad Magad in his speech yesterday.   We  will\r\n\r\nstudy  this further to see how it can be extended to the private\r\n\r\nsector wage structure to allow for greater flexibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are grappling with the immediate concerns caused by the\r\n\r\nregional economic crisis, we must also be aware of the  need  to\r\n\r\nbuild up capabilities and formulate strategies for our long-term\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  If we ignore the challenges that globalization\r\n\r\nwill bring, we will become even more vulnerable in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the CSC's vision of Singapore as an advanced\r\n\r\nand  knowledge-based economy provides a sound basis  for  us  to\r\n\r\nplan  our manpower development.  My Ministry supports the  CSC's\r\n\r\ntwo-pronged  approach  to  developing a  world-class  workforce:\r\n\r\nfirstly,   to  maximize  the  full  potential  of  the  domestic\r\n\r\nworkforce;  and secondly, to attract foreign talent  to  enhance\r\n\r\nour capabilities and competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Maximize the full potential of domestic manpower</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to maximizing the full potential of domestic\r\n\r\nmanpower, my Ministry is working closely with the Ministries of\r\n\r\nEducation and Trade and Industry, economic agencies like the\r\n\r\nProductivity and Standards Board and Economic Development Board,\r\n\r\nas well as industry partners, to develop a lifelong learning\r\n\r\nsystem in Singapore. This system is critical to maintaining the\r\n\r\ncurrency and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  of  Singapore's  workforce.  It  would  provide\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  support  for every  Singaporean  to  undergo\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning  for their continued employability.  In  this\r\n\r\nsystem,  the  stakeholders  are employers,  public  and  private\r\n\r\ntraining providers, unions and community organizations  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the workers themselves.   Everyone will play an enhanced\r\n\r\nrole  in  supporting  the in-employment training  needs  of  our\r\n\r\nworkforce.   Additional  funding  will  be  allocated  and   new\r\n\r\nlearning  initiatives will be developed to  encourage  employers\r\n\r\nand  workers to engage in lifelong learning.  A national  skills\r\n\r\nrecognition system will be established to recognize and  certify\r\n\r\nin-employment  skills  acquisition.  New  training  technologies\r\n\r\nwill be harnessed to support this endeavour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kick-start the process of lifelong learning for continued\r\n\r\nemployability, two national programmes have been put  in  place.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the  Skills Redevelopment Programme  (SRP)  and  the\r\n\r\nCritical  Enabling Skills for Training (CREST).  Training  under\r\n\r\nSRP  leads  to  national skills certification and  every  worker\r\n\r\ntrained  is placed with a job, either with his existing employer\r\n\r\nor  a  prospective new employer.  This ensures that the training\r\n\r\nis  immediately relevant.  SRP has been progressing  well  since\r\n\r\nits  launch  in  December 1996, as I have  informed  this  House\r\n\r\nyesterday.   A  total of about 190 companies have  committed  to\r\n\r\nskill certifying more than 10,500 workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June this year, the Government committed an additional $20\r\n\r\nmillion to developing a Skills Development Centre to improve the\r\n\r\ntraining  infrastructure  to support training  activities  under\r\n\r\nSRP.   I  am glad to say that the Skills Development Centre  has\r\n\r\nalready started taking in trainees in November this year.  CREST\r\n\r\nis  a  $200  million programme launched by the Productivity  and\r\n\r\nStandards  Board.  It is aimed at encouraging the  workforce  to\r\n\r\nacquire  core  skills,  which will provide  the  foundation  for\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading in all occupations and sectors.  These  skills\r\n\r\nare  important in achieving a thinking, learning and  innovative\r\n\r\nworkforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the on-going Manpower 21 planning exercise will study the\r\n\r\nrecommendations   of   the  CSC  which  pertains   to   manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment.    Apart  from  establishing  a  national  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning system, the Manpower 21 Committee will be looking  into\r\n\r\nhow  we  can  enhance  the  workplace environment,  upgrade  the\r\n\r\nmanpower industry structure, and harness international talent to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  capabilities of our workforce  remain  a  key\r\n\r\ncompetitive  advantage for Singapore in  the  next  century.  We\r\n\r\nshould  have detailed proposals from the Committee by the middle\r\n\r\nof next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhance the attractiveness of Singapore to foreign talent</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On foreign talent, Government agrees with the importance of\r\n\r\ntapping into global sources of talent to sharpen our competitive\r\n\r\nedge  and  overcome  our manpower constraints.   Foreign  talent\r\n\r\ncombined with a highly skilled local workforce will enable us to\r\n\r\ntransit smoothly and rapidly into a knowledge economy.  They can\r\n\r\nhelp  us to raise our attractiveness to more MNCs to locate  key\r\n\r\nknowledge operations in Singapore and thus enhance our  economic\r\n\r\nvalue-added.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore evolves into a knowledge economy, the key\r\n\r\ndeterminants  of  success will be the skills,  capabilities  and\r\n\r\ninnovativeness  of  our workers.  Increasing global  competition\r\n\r\nwill put a premium on skilled workers. We will develop our home-grown talent fully with a new strategic manpower blueprint under\r\n\r\nthe  Manpower  21 planning effort.  At the same  time,  we  must\r\n\r\naugment local talent with a flow of international talent.   This\r\n\r\nwill  provide Singapore with the enhanced capacity  to  generate\r\n\r\nhigh  value added activities which is in tune with the knowledge\r\n\r\nera.  Examples of such high-value added activities are the areas\r\n\r\nof  e-commerce, wireless communications, automotive  components,\r\n\r\npharmaceuticals  and  chemical industries, where  our  companies\r\n\r\ntoday  still find themselves short of IT and engineering talent,\r\n\r\ndespite the current economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must be prepared for the new global competition and\r\n\r\nchange  our  mindset  and  mode of operations  accordingly.  Our\r\n\r\nvision  of Singapore as a globally competitive knowledge economy\r\n\r\nand  a world-class workforce has scope for home-grown talent  to\r\n\r\nrealize their full potential. It will also serve as a magnet  to\r\n\r\nattract   international  talent  to  participate  in  the   many\r\n\r\nchallenging  opportunities  which are  unfolding  with  the  new\r\n\r\neconomic re-positioning of Singapore.  With an augmented  talent\r\n\r\npool we are in a better position to expand our economic pie  and\r\n\r\nhave  more gains to be shared by all. We need to grow our  stock\r\n\r\nof  talent  to excel in the competition which would  be  brought\r\n\r\nabout  in  the  future. My Ministry will adopt  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\napproach  to  developing  our  own  manpower  as  well  as   the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of international talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not lose sight of the longer-term challenges\r\n\r\nbecause of the current downturn.  Attracting foreign talents  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  is one aspect which can be easily swept aside  during\r\n\r\nthis  period of rising unemployment.  But if we do so,  we  will\r\n\r\nonly  hamper  the growth in new businesses and industries  which\r\n\r\ncould play a major role in speeding up recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the region recovers from the current economic crisis,\r\n\r\nthere will be intense competition for talent.  We must not  wait\r\n\r\nfor this to happen and then set out to attract our fair share of\r\n\r\ntalent.   In  fact,  we must try to attract our  fair  share  of\r\n\r\ntalent  now and take advantage of the inherent strength  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy  to attract talent at this juncture so as to stay  ahead\r\n\r\nin   this  race  and  to  better  position  ourselves  for   the\r\n\r\ncompetition in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recession we are experiencing is a consequence of the\r\n\r\nregional  problems.  But we must act firmly  and  positively  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  new  economic  conditions.   We  have  to  make\r\n\r\nadjustments,  including  those  that  are  painful.   The  CSC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations to cut business costs, including wage cost, is a\r\n\r\nsound and viable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napproach  to  cope  with the loss of competitiveness.   However,\r\n\r\ncost-cutting measures alone will not ensure that Singapore would\r\n\r\nremain  competitive.  In the longer term, it is the  creativity,\r\n\r\ncapability,  productivity and enterprise of  Singaporeans  which\r\n\r\nwill  determine  whether  we  will prosper  in  an  increasingly\r\n\r\ncompetitive  global environment.  As long as our  employers  and\r\n\r\ncompanies,  trade  unions and workers  continue  to  strive  for\r\n\r\nproductivity improvement and skills upgrading, we need not fear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through tripartite cooperation and support, we have been able to\r\n\r\nimplement cost-cutting measures to overcome the economic  crisis\r\n\r\nin  the  1985/86  recession.  Given the  close  partnership  and\r\n\r\nstrong co-operation between workers, employers and Government, I\r\n\r\nam  confident that we will again be able to work hand-in-hand as\r\n\r\na  Singapore  team to meet the challenges ahead,  and  help  our\r\n\r\neconomy recover speedily from the present crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Clarification from the\r\n\r\nMinister,  Sir.   I  have two clarifications.   Can  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister, out of the 20,000 workers retrenched, how many of them\r\n\r\nare  Singaporeans?  The other is the figure given by Mr  Cyrille\r\n\r\nTan in his speech in this House.  He said that there are 600,000\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  in  Singapore.   And  the  Minister  has  just\r\n\r\nmentioned that there are only 450,000.  There is a difference of\r\n\r\n150,000  between  the figures of the union and  the  Government.\r\n\r\nWhich is correct?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first nine\r\n\r\nmonths  of  this year, about 20,000 workers had been retrenched.\r\n\r\nOverall,  when  companies retrench their workers, they  retrench\r\n\r\nthem  in the proportion of their workforce.  Companies that have\r\n\r\nmore  foreign workers will retrench in proportion to the profile\r\n\r\nof  their workforce.  So out of that 20,000, on average,  it  is\r\n\r\nabout  70:30, because that is the typical profile of the foreign\r\n\r\nworkforce in most manufacturing and service sector\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies.   So  foreign workers will constitute  about  30%  of\r\n\r\nthose who were retrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the number of foreign workers in Singapore,\r\n\r\nmy figure obviously would be a more reliable figure.  It is more\r\n\r\nthan 450,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\nIn  view  of  the economic downturn, wage cut and  unemployment,\r\n\r\nwill  the Ministry revise downwards the threshold for employment\r\n\r\npass applications?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in September this year we\r\n\r\nintroduced a new work pass framework, PQR framework, whereby the\r\n\r\ntop  talent  would  be under the \"P\" work  passes  and  \"R\"  for\r\n\r\nrestricted,  before the lower skilled workers.  The  \"Q\"  passes\r\n\r\nwould  be for the in-between grades of talents that we  need  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It is a very flexible system.  Although  there  are\r\n\r\nwage  criteria such as $2,000 for a \"Q\" pass or employment pass,\r\n\r\nwe  are  prepared  to  look  at the background  or  the  working\r\n\r\nexperience and qualifications of a particular worker and  decide\r\n\r\nwhich  particular pass to grant to the foreigner.   So  in  this\r\n\r\ncase, there is no necessity to further revise the wage criteria,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have sufficient flexibility within  the  system  to\r\n\r\ncater to the needs of employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether he has got any plans for skills  training\r\n\r\nfor  the  foreign workers, because they form quite a substantial\r\n\r\nworkforce  and  some  of  them are educated  but  they  are  not\r\n\r\nequipped in English language?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if an employer wants to send\r\n\r\nhis   foreign  worker  for  training,  we  will  look  into  the\r\n\r\nparticular training requirement.  In many instances, it can also\r\n\r\nbe supported.  But, of course, in the context of the work permit\r\n\r\nholders, the unskilled and semi-skilled workers, it will  be  so\r\n\r\nmuch better if the employers make a special effort and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecruit  skilled  workers  from abroad,  rather  than  bring  in\r\n\r\nunskilled  workers here to be trained.  That is why my  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  encouraged  the construction industry to  take  up  private\r\n\r\ninitiative  to set up skill assessment centres in  our  overseas\r\n\r\nsources  of  foreign  workers  -  China,  Thailand,  Bangladesh,\r\n\r\nMyanmar.   The purpose is for them to screen the applicants  for\r\n\r\nwork  permits who want to come to Singapore to find out who  are\r\n\r\nthe  skilled workers and then bring them to Singapore.  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is  a  far  better  approach than  to  bring  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nthousands of unskilled workers into Singapore and then set about\r\n\r\ntrying  to  train  them to upgrade their  skills.   The  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  are available out there.  Go out there and recruit  the\r\n\r\nskilled workers.  It is far cheaper that way, more effective and\r\n\r\nefficient for business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  CSC has made a Report  on  the  economy  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in the past and it has also made recommendations  for\r\n\r\nour  present and future economy.  It is a rational look  at  our\r\n\r\neconomy and I endorse the view of the Committee and also support\r\n\r\nthe recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking into the past, the Committee made use of the\r\n\r\nassessment  of  Singapore's competitiveness by various  economic\r\n\r\nconsultancy agencies, and it came to the conclusion that if  not\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  currency turmoil, Singapore's competitiveness  was\r\n\r\nranked  very  high.  We all know that Singapore is not  a  cheap\r\n\r\nplace.   In  terms of wages, rentals and cost of living,  it  is\r\n\r\nquite  high.   So  we  are  able  to,  in  spite  of  all  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, maintain our competitiveness in a higher rank, as\r\n\r\nstated in the Report, because of the qualitative factors.  It is\r\n\r\nbecause  we have political stability, we have tripartism  and  a\r\n\r\nhigh  degree  of  transparency and pro-business  policies.   The\r\n\r\nannounced cost cutting package by DPM Lee is the result of  this\r\n\r\nqualitative factor in our competitive capability as mentioned in\r\n\r\nthe Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is a country marching towards a\r\n\r\ndeveloped status.  Our cost of production cannot be compared to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose    in   Indonesia,   Philippines   and   Malaysia.     Our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness will go through economic transformation  towards\r\n\r\na   knowledge-based  economy  and  strengthen  the   qualitative\r\n\r\nfactors.   At  the  moment,  in this regional  currency  crisis,\r\n\r\nbecause of the realignment and depreciation of currencies in the\r\n\r\nregion,  our competitiveness is affected.  So for the short-term\r\n\r\nstrategies,  the  Report  has already made  recommendations  for\r\n\r\ncutting  wages and CPF.  I think these should only be short-term\r\n\r\nmeasures.    When   our  economy  recovers  and  competitiveness\r\n\r\nregains,  all these should gradually be restored.  I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  management  will be able to make use of these  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures  to revive their competitiveness and to increase  their\r\n\r\nsales  and market share, so as to help the Singapore economy  to\r\n\r\nrecover as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in the public debate in cost cutting, the people and\r\n\r\nthe  unions  have already expressed their support for tripartism\r\n\r\nand  they  have  accepted the wage cut and CPF  cut.   But  some\r\n\r\nmanagements have asked for excessive demands.  They  have  asked\r\n\r\nfor  pay cuts by 30% and some hope that the pay, especially that\r\n\r\nof  the  graduates,  be  reduced  to  those  prevailing  in  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  Malaysia and Indonesia.  These are  excessive  and\r\n\r\nunreasonable demands and taking advantage of the situation.   As\r\n\r\na  result, the people may doubt their management's sincerity  in\r\n\r\ntripartism.   In  my  view, the wage cuts  must  be  within  the\r\n\r\nbearable level of the workers.  For those companies that are not\r\n\r\nviable  after  these significant cost cutting  measures,  in  my\r\n\r\nview, the problems they have are beyond what the Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  workers  could help.  If that is the case, we should  allow\r\n\r\nthese non-viable companies to wind up, so that the resources can\r\n\r\nbe  diverted to the viable companies.  Over the long term,  this\r\n\r\nwill be better for our workers and Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of costs, apart from wages, I think there are\r\n\r\nother charges such as Government charges, cost due to Government\r\n\r\npolicies,  efficiency  in production  and  rentals.   On  wages,\r\n\r\nwhether we like it or not, it must rise according to the  higher\r\n\r\nstandard of living,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhigher standard of education, as well as the progress in society\r\n\r\nand  a  higher  value  added economy.  This  is  inevitable.   A\r\n\r\nsociety's progress must bring about a better income and a better\r\n\r\nlife.   This is progress and advancement of a country that  will\r\n\r\nbring  benefits  to the people and that is why we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nmotivate our people to work harder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look over the past 10 years, the average wage in 1986 was\r\n\r\n$1,140 per month per capita, and this has increased to $2,219 in\r\n\r\n1995.   This  is an increase of 100%, averaging about  7.2%  per\r\n\r\nannum.   If  we  go  by  GDP,  the value-added  per  worker  has\r\n\r\nincreased  from $32,000 in 1986 to about $71,000 in 1995.   That\r\n\r\nmeans  over a period of 10 years, there is an increase  of  8.2%\r\n\r\nper  annum.   If we compare the 7.2% wage increase and  GDP  per\r\n\r\nworker  increase of 8.2%, then the average annual wage  increase\r\n\r\nover the past 10 years of 7.2% is not unacceptable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to maintain our competitive edge and to satisfy the\r\n\r\ndesire  of  workers  to improve their standard  of  living,  our\r\n\r\neconomy   must,  as  stated  in  the  Report,  go  through   the\r\n\r\ntransformation  process towards a knowledge-based  economy  with\r\n\r\nbetter  training  of workers,  better education,  more  creative\r\n\r\ninnovations  and  entrepreneurship, so that  we  can  reach  for\r\n\r\nhigher value-added of new products.  This strategy for wage  cut\r\n\r\nis  one  measure that we have proposed to tide over the  present\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   After this storm, we should be able  to  restore\r\n\r\nthe wages and improve the quality of living of our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rental is an important component in the cost of operation.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I went to a coffeeshop in my constituency.   I  spent\r\n\r\n60 cents on a cup of black coffee.  I made a simple calculation.\r\n\r\nHow  much  does  rental cost impact on the price  of  a  cup  of\r\n\r\ncoffee?  I found that it accounts for about one-sixth, that  is,\r\n\r\nabout 19% of the price.  Rentals have been rising for many years\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   For  one particular year  from  1994  to  1995,\r\n\r\nrentals for factories, offices and warehouses have increased  by\r\n\r\nabout 45% to 50%.  Such a huge increase in rent affects the cost\r\n\r\nof  operation significantly.  The ups and downs of  rentals  are\r\n\r\ncaused by supply and demand situation and also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspeculation.   I am glad to note the Government is dealing  with\r\n\r\nthe over-supply of properties and the downward trend in property\r\n\r\nprices.   On the one hand, the Government is sympathetic towards\r\n\r\nthe developers and it has given them property tax rebates, allow\r\n\r\nthem  a  longer  time to complete their projects  and  free  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  land  sales,  but insists  on  the  anti-speculation\r\n\r\nmeasures  in property announced in 1996.  The Government  should\r\n\r\nmonitor very closely the price trends in our property market and\r\n\r\ncontinue to adopt the anti-speculation strategies, so that  when\r\n\r\nit   reaches the bottom we should start releasing lands to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  demand.  By doing so, we will be able to avoid this  sudden\r\n\r\nrise and fall of rentals, thereby affecting our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, it was announced that, in response to the one-third\r\n\r\ndrop  in  land price in the past one year,  all rentals  of  JTC\r\n\r\nindustrial  properties would be cut between 20%  and  40%.   HDB\r\n\r\nwill  also  cut  their  rentals for  industrial  and  commercial\r\n\r\npremises by about 20%.  Unfortunately, JTC offers an increase of\r\n\r\nabout  4%  of  the rentals per annum for those who asked  for  a\r\n\r\nfixed  rental  rate.  I think this will give a false  impression\r\n\r\nthat future rentals will move upwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Government measures could also cause some cost increases.\r\n\r\nFor instance, take the construction industry as an example.   In\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  shortage  in  supply of  labour,  the  compulsory\r\n\r\nrequirement  for  safety  officers  and  resident  engineers  at\r\n\r\nworksites will add to the cost, because companies have to employ\r\n\r\na  lot of non-productive employees at higher than market prices.\r\n\r\nThe  Report  also referred to low productivity in  the  building\r\n\r\nindustry.  It was suggested that prefabricated concept  be  used\r\n\r\nto  increase  productivity.  I think the  authorities  concerned\r\n\r\nshould  look  into  this very seriously to  understand  why  the\r\n\r\nprefabricated   building  process  has   cost   more   and   the\r\n\r\nprefabrication factories are unable to survive before going in a\r\n\r\nbig\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nway   for  the  prefabrication  concept.   Misunderstanding  the\r\n\r\nsituation  will  only add to cost and it is  not  good  for  our\r\n\r\nbuilding industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Government measures are closely related to\r\n\r\ncost.  We have to ensure that our policies are pro-business.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it is the only way to go.  With the cost-cutting  package\r\n\r\nannounced  yesterday,  I am sure the wage  earner's  ability  to\r\n\r\nspend  will  be  lowered.  The businessmen will benefit.   I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  about those businesses who are providing services  to\r\n\r\nour  domestic  market, like the shops, transport  services,  and\r\n\r\nhawker  stalls.   How are they going to provide better  services\r\n\r\nand cheaper goods? This is very important.  Last week, in one of\r\n\r\nthe  programmes on radio, some hawkers were interviewed.  Nobody\r\n\r\nagreed  or  intended to cut down their prices.  If that  is  the\r\n\r\ncase, the Government should also consider how we can plough back\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  from the cost cutting measures  to  our  ordinary\r\n\r\ncitizens  so that they will also benefit.  One way is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  these rebates are not automatic.  They must apply  for  it\r\n\r\nand  show how they are going to reduce prices before the rebates\r\n\r\nare  given.   In  this way, when the cost-cutting  measures  are\r\n\r\nimplemented, our consumers can also get some benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the CSC Report and the announcement of cost cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures   yesterday,   no  mention  was   made   to   high-tech\r\n\r\nagriculture.  I think this industrial sector should also benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  the  rental  reduction  from  the  PPD  and  property  tax\r\n\r\nreduction from the land office so that they will be able to  cut\r\n\r\ntheir  costs  and  make their products more competitive  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, during the good times, we want to clamour for the five Cs - car, condominium, credit cards, career and cash.  Yesterday,  we\r\n\r\nsaw  DPM Lee giving away five Cs in not so good times, in  terms\r\n\r\nof    cash,    care,   career,   credibility    and,    finally,\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Let me try and respond in this manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Cash. I think the real cost reduction package is much\r\n\r\nwelcomed  to  businesses.  There is certainly  no  bail-out,  no\r\n\r\ncompany  buy-outs.   Those who ask for  handouts  are  certainly\r\n\r\ndisappointed.  But I agree with the DPM that the question is not\r\n\r\nhow  much more we should give now, but whether there is more  to\r\n\r\ngive if the situation worsens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Care. I am happy that the package contains measures and\r\n\r\nrebates to help the lower income groups to ease the pain of wage\r\n\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Career. I am happy with the Minister for Manpower and the\r\n\r\nDPM  for stating that the package, hopefully, will kick in  fast\r\n\r\nto  save  jobs.   The  Minister for  Manpower  has  demonstrated\r\n\r\ncommitment  of the Government to retrain workers and  help  them\r\n\r\nfind  jobs.  I hope, given the cost reduction, employers  remain\r\n\r\ncommitted to train their workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Credibility. The reduction in Government charges and pay\r\n\r\ncuts of Government Ministers and civil servants, in my view, are\r\n\r\nequitable and proportionate, if seen as a whole.  I would  think\r\n\r\nthat the Minister's salary would be affected two years from  now\r\n\r\nif  the  formula takes place.  But any kind gesture is welcomed.\r\n\r\nI  can  only assure the Minister that what he gives in cash,  he\r\n\r\ngets more than equal measure in credibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Competitiveness. I think we expect more measures to come in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  budget.   But  I urge, and  I  think  I  have  some\r\n\r\ncommitment  that the CSC mechanism can be made part  of  an  on-going process to make sure that we remain competitive now and in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just touch on a few other long-term strategic\r\n\r\nrecommendations covered by the CSC.  I am quite pleased that the\r\n\r\nCommittee  comprises  many people in  the  private  sector.   It\r\n\r\ndemonstrates  the importance of a healthy state of participation\r\n\r\nand   consultation   in  decision-making   in   Singapore   from\r\n\r\nexperienced   and  expert  people  in  the  industry.    Without\r\n\r\nparticipation,   any  attempt  to  critically  examine   current\r\n\r\npolicies and strategies will be futile\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  it is not only difficult to persuade workers to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  painful  wage cuts, it may also turn out to be a  worthless\r\n\r\npaper  exercise.  If every citizen matters, we must also  accept\r\n\r\nthe  value, suggestions or inputs of every Singaporean.   But  I\r\n\r\nreally   wonder  how  much  of  this  model  of  private  sector\r\n\r\nparticipation  is  present at the implementation  level  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistries and statutory boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report quite rightly observed that the current economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  highlighted the importance of Government as  a  business\r\n\r\nfacilitator.  But it should go beyond just being the  regulatory\r\n\r\nauthority  and  providing the environment that is  conducive  to\r\n\r\nbusiness.   It  should also promote prudent and  sound  business\r\n\r\npractices and initiate change as an ongoing process.   Take  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  JTC,  for  example, where  the  minimum  criteria  for\r\n\r\ninvestment in building, civil and machinery run counter  to  the\r\n\r\npreference  and  practices of many businesses.   Why  invest  in\r\n\r\nbrick and mortar that do not generate income or not vital to the\r\n\r\noperating   requirements   of  businesses,   compared   to   the\r\n\r\ninvestments in people, plant and machinery and technology?   Why\r\n\r\nuse the price mechanism to control design of buildings?  Are the\r\n\r\narchitects  not supposed to do that?  We should instead  support\r\n\r\nindustrialists  who can extract the maximum return  for  minimum\r\n\r\ninvestment.   Industrialists  can  provide  the  greatest  value\r\n\r\nadding  potential.  But this requires private sector  experience\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  believe,  is  quite  lacking  at  certain  levels  of\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Perhaps, as a long-term strategy,  the  Government\r\n\r\ncan try seconding some of its officers to the private sector and\r\n\r\nencourage more recruitment from the private sector to the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  and  statutory boards.  Otherwise, we  will  hear  more\r\n\r\ncalls for committees and commissions.  True, I think we need  to\r\n\r\nrelook and re-examine our regionalisation process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the CSC's recommendations to extend our external wing.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  go global.  But we need to critically examine  our\r\n\r\npast efforts at regionalisation and our cooperative efforts with\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  Indonesia, China and India where we  have  presumably\r\n\r\nhad the best chance of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  exporting our software, the Singapore's recipe  for\r\n\r\nsuccess.  What can we learn from these challenges?  How  can  we\r\n\r\nshare  with other Singapore companies?  What happens to guan  xi\r\n\r\nin  China?  Should we remain engaged in these regions or try  to\r\n\r\ndiversify our very limited resources globally?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fear, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that the crisis may have exposed\r\n\r\nthe  myth  about our relevance and understanding  of  our  Asian\r\n\r\nneighbours  that we are the best partners or agents for  western\r\n\r\ncompanies who want to invest in the region.  What the crisis had\r\n\r\nshown  perhaps is that Asia is indeed very diverse.   Sometimes,\r\n\r\nwe  really  have  very little common with a  Thai,  Filipino  or\r\n\r\nCambodian   as  would  an  American  or  European.   We   behave\r\n\r\ndifferently.  We do not speak the same language.  And sometimes,\r\n\r\nsome  of our neighbours are not so quite friendly with us.   But\r\n\r\nwe really need to examine this and maximise our similarities and\r\n\r\nmake  ourselves more relevant to the region.  We can do a number\r\n\r\nof  things  to  ensure that we really are the best  hub  in  the\r\n\r\nregion,  not only in terms of geography, but in our  ability  to\r\n\r\nwork  with our neighbours and friends.  For example, having more\r\n\r\nAsian  students studying and working in the country,  increasing\r\n\r\nexchange  at all levels of society and Government and  introduce\r\n\r\nthe  teaching  of Asian languages and cultures in our  education\r\n\r\nsystem  and allowing more access of the Asian media, both  print\r\n\r\nand  broadcast, into Singapore.  We want to be relevant to Asia.\r\n\r\nBut we must first ensure that Asia, its people, culture, history\r\n\r\nand language are all relevant to everyone of us here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must not lose sight and be distracted by the cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  alone  as  we  benchmark  against   the   newly\r\n\r\nindustrialised  economies.  We must attract higher  value  added\r\n\r\noperations to locate in Singapore and try to invite more foreign\r\n\r\ntalents to this country.  But the qualitative factors that  help\r\n\r\nto  make  Singapore livable becomes also increasingly important.\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness  includes more human dimensions,  such  as  good\r\n\r\nschools, vibrant entertainment,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npollution-free  environment and the  intellectual  and  creative\r\n\r\nstimulation, the buzz that is present in any global  city.   For\r\n\r\nexample, if we want to develop Singapore into a media hub, it is\r\n\r\nessential that we have a media into and out of Singapore that is\r\n\r\naccessible, affordable and convenient, that is not unnecessarily\r\n\r\nobstructive.   This  would  mean  easier  access  to  Government\r\n\r\ninformation  and an intellectual environment that  protects  and\r\n\r\nvalues   expression,  disagreement  and  exchange,  though   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  dissent, and an active civil society and  a  strong\r\n\r\npeople's sector.  In other words, Singapore is not only  a  home\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans but a much desired destination for foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Minister for Manpower touched on foreign talent.\r\n\r\nWhile  it  is appropriate to expect Singaporeans, including  top\r\n\r\nlevel  executives, to make the symbolic sacrifice  in  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes,  we  have  to  be careful that these do  not  affect  our\r\n\r\nattempts  to  attract foreign talent that is perhaps  even  more\r\n\r\nnecessary now to boost competitiveness.  They may not come  here\r\n\r\nif  the  total package of remuneration is inferior to what  they\r\n\r\nget  elsewhere.  We must be careful and ensure that  we  do  not\r\n\r\nsingle them out for not willing to bear the same sacrifices that\r\n\r\nwe, as Singaporeans, shoulder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, SMEs. The crisis has shown a trend for greater\r\n\r\norientation  towards Europe and America in the way they  conduct\r\n\r\nbusiness.   Not  only in terms of markets, but global  MNCs  now\r\n\r\nrequire suppliers to adopt corporate discipline and values  that\r\n\r\nare  consistent with their attitudes, for example,  the  respect\r\n\r\nfor   intellectual   property,  labour   rights,   environmental\r\n\r\nconcerns,  free from graft and corruption, absence  of  age  and\r\n\r\ngender  discrimination.  If we want to go global and be a  major\r\n\r\npartner  to  European  and  American  companies,  SMEs  must  be\r\n\r\nassisted to help them deal with some of these issues which  many\r\n\r\nSMEs  may otherwise consider an unnecessary intrusion into their\r\n\r\nbusiness affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the recommendations of the CSC and\r\n\r\ncompliment the efforts of the CSC but also urge that the efforts\r\n\r\nthey put in be made part of an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nongoing  process.   We  have  heard  calls  for  reformation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  hope we have similar reformation in  wanting  to\r\n\r\nchange mindsets and to ensure that we have to place whatever  it\r\n\r\ntakes to put our economy back on track.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion in the name of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, consensus building requires trust and patience.  To foreign\r\n\r\nobservers,  the package of cost cutting measures recommended  by\r\n\r\nthe  CSC  and the reconvened NWC is remarkable, because  we  are\r\n\r\nable  to reach a consensus on cutting wage costs - no less  than\r\n\r\n$7.5  billion  of  it.  And we have reached  this  consensus  so\r\n\r\nsmoothly, it seems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is reaching this consensus an easy matter? Well, just look at\r\n\r\nHong Kong.  You cannot find a better example of a market economy\r\n\r\nthan  Hong  Kong.  The employers know what to do, but  can  they\r\n\r\neffect it?  Hong Kong Telecom has been unable to make its  bonus\r\n\r\npayment  flexible,  linking  payment  to  earnings,  let   alone\r\n\r\nimplement a wage cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is not a command economy, as some Hong Kong officials seem\r\n\r\nto  think,  as  reported in Asiaweek.  Ours is  a  system  where\r\n\r\npolitical   and   trade  union  leaders  have  to   face   their\r\n\r\nconstituents in election by secret ballot at regular intervals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been fortunate in this downturn to have leaders in the\r\n\r\nNTUC  and  the  unions who went through the  1985/86  recession.\r\n\r\nFrom  that experience, they know that effective medicine  for  a\r\n\r\nsevere    illness   tastes   bitter.    They    are    therefore\r\n\r\npsychologically prepared for tough measures in this downturn and\r\n\r\nthis time, the measures are in fact more severe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985/86, we cut wage costs from the employers'\r\n\r\ncontribution  to CPF.  It was a cut in savings for  the  future.\r\n\r\nFor  the  vast majority, disposable income was not cut -  as  we\r\n\r\nadopted a wage freeze, and not a wage cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, we have gone beyond cutting savings for the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Not only are we cutting employers' contribution to CPF,\r\n\r\nbut  we  are  also  cutting disposable income.  Fortunately,  we\r\n\r\nhave,  since  the last recession, put in place a  flexible  wage\r\n\r\nsystem.   It  allows  us to cut wage costs by  cutting  bonuses,\r\n\r\nwhich is less painful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a question was asked yesterday: why is it necessary\r\n\r\nto  state  how much we should cut wage cost?  Mr Low asked  that\r\n\r\nquestion.  It is a matter of fairness.  Workers are prepared  to\r\n\r\ndo  their part, accept wage cuts to restore our competitiveness,\r\n\r\nbut  they need to know how much is really needed.  So first,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to know how much we have lost in competitiveness.   If  we\r\n\r\nassess  that we need to cut costs by 15%, then workers would  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to accept a 15% cut in wage costs.  If we do not  have\r\n\r\nsuch a figure, how are our workers to know that what an employer\r\n\r\nwants to cut is fair?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round, we have had to depend largely on figures provided by\r\n\r\nthe Government.  One indicator has been the relative unit labour\r\n\r\ncost,  a  comparison  of  our  wage  cost  with  selected  Asian\r\n\r\ncompetitors.  Another indicator has been the weighted change  in\r\n\r\ncurrency realignments, or effective exchange rate.  Both pointed\r\n\r\nto something close to 15% to 20% range.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, figures provided by employers have been grossly\r\n\r\ninadequate.   When  I  mentioned this publicly,  some  employers\r\n\r\nreacted  indignantly, saying that for over a year already,  they\r\n\r\nhave said that Singapore has lost competitiveness, and cost cuts\r\n\r\nwere  needed.   They protested that they have  even  raised  the\r\n\r\nmatter  in  Parliament.  Yes, employers have  mostly  asked  for\r\n\r\ncuts,  ranging  from  5%  to 30%, but without  providing  cross-country  comparisons on cost items.  This is an example of  what\r\n\r\nunionists  mean  when  they complain of a  lack  of  information\r\n\r\nsharing.   Fortunately, some employers have provided information\r\n\r\nof   cost   differentials  from  their  factories  in  different\r\n\r\nlocations, but privately.  Some of them provided the figures  to\r\n\r\nus at NTUC, some to EDB and MTI.  And these were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindividual employers.  The figures they provided have allowed us\r\n\r\nto gauge whether the macro figures were largely correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not raise this now to re-open the exchange. Rather,\r\n\r\nwe should learn from this experience.  Employers must appreciate\r\n\r\nthat we have a better-educated, more discerning workforce.  They\r\n\r\nexpect greater transparency from employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we need to establish a number, one which, to the best of\r\n\r\nour  ability, we think is right.  It then becomes the guide  for\r\n\r\nactual   settlements  at  the  workplace.   We   should   expect\r\n\r\nnegotiations  at  the workplace - so some  cuts  will  be  more,\r\n\r\nothers  less  than  15%.   There will  be  negotiations  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace  and  employers cannot take it for granted  that  just\r\n\r\nbecause  we have reached this national consensus, that  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething that will be effected without further discussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a company is unionised, I am confident that union\r\n\r\nleaders  will settle with management rationally, and  they  will\r\n\r\nsee  to  it that the cuts are fair to the workers.  In the  last\r\n\r\nfew  months, we have had a lot of discussions within  the  union\r\n\r\nmovement.   After several rounds of discussions, I  reported  to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister and DPM that they need not worry about  the\r\n\r\nunionised  sector, but they should be concerned  with  the  non-unionised sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have a figure, which we make public now, how\r\n\r\nare  non-unionised workers to know whether the  wage  cut  their\r\n\r\nemployers  are asking for is fair?  Granted management  in  non-unionised  companies can effect any cuts they deem necessary  as\r\n\r\ntheir  employees have little choice, but what about  the  social\r\n\r\ndiscontent generated?  To face this downturn, social cohesion is\r\n\r\nimportant, as many Members of this House have said.  Naming  the\r\n\r\nfigure  of  15% is thus necessary to serve as the benchmark  for\r\n\r\nall, and remember we have the figure of 30% mentioned once again\r\n\r\nin this House in the past two days even after we have reached  a\r\n\r\nnational consensus in the National Wages Council!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move to implementing the wage cuts company by\r\n\r\ncompany,  let  us not forget to maintain fairness.   The  public\r\n\r\nsector  has shown the way.  The cuts in public sector  pay  that\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister announced yesterday was reached  through\r\n\r\ndiscussions between the Public Service Division and  the  public\r\n\r\nsector  unions.  The final figures were agreed to only yesterday\r\n\r\nmorning.   I  hope  private  sector employers  will  follow  the\r\n\r\nexample  of  the public sector -  cutting more at  the  top  and\r\n\r\nminimising the cuts to low income workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It cannot have escaped the attention of employers that\r\n\r\nhigher  income civil servants are taking a cut in  monthly  pay,\r\n\r\nthrough   the  monthly  variable  component.   Since  the   last\r\n\r\nrecession,  the  public  sector  has  consciously  developed   a\r\n\r\nflexible   wage  system,  which  includes  a  monthly   variable\r\n\r\ncomponent.  It is made up of unconsolidated NWC wage increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the private sector had been as attentive in wage\r\n\r\nadministration  as the public sector has been,  they  too  would\r\n\r\nhave  a substantial monthly variable component by now.  It would\r\n\r\nnot  have  increased  wage  costs, since  the  monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent is taken out of a total amount of wage increase agreed\r\n\r\nto  under  the  ambit  of  the NWC,  as  a  consequence  of  NWC\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  When I suggested recently that we should build\r\n\r\nup  a  variable monthly component in private sector pay systems,\r\n\r\nthe   reaction  from  employers  showed  a  singular   lack   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding.  It shows how poorly they have paid attention  to\r\n\r\nwage  administration.  Some were guarded in their reaction,  but\r\n\r\nothers  almost condemned it!  I hope they will now study closely\r\n\r\nhow   the  public  sector  has  managed  its  wage  system,  and\r\n\r\nunderstand  how they too can build flexibility into  their  wage\r\n\r\nsystems.  Just as we learnt from the last recession and  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  a  flexi  wage  system, so too must we  learn  from  this\r\n\r\nrecession  and  refine our wage system so as to  better  meet  a\r\n\r\nfuture  recession.  I hope it will not happen  but  as  business\r\n\r\ncycles go, we know that it will come sooner or later.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the welfare of workers and their families depends on\r\n\r\nemployment. Employment, however, depends on companies  remaining\r\n\r\nviable.  Therefore, the top priority of any Government or  union\r\n\r\nin  an  economic  downturn must be to ensure that  workers  stay\r\n\r\nemployed.   If that requires wages to be cut, we will  cut.   We\r\n\r\nhave  done so in 1985/86 and we are doing it again.  This  shows\r\n\r\nhow flexible and responsible unions are in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tripartite understanding we have developed is a\r\n\r\nvaluable  asset  which we must maintain.  It depends  on  trust.\r\n\r\nEach  party  must  play its part to maintain  that  trust.   The\r\n\r\nobjective  of  this  cost cutting package is to  keep  companies\r\n\r\nviable,  restore  their  competitiveness,  so  that  they   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to provide jobs for their workers.  Labour is  playing\r\n\r\nits part by agreeing to wage cost cuts.  Now employers must play\r\n\r\ntheirs.   No doubt some retrenchments are unavoidable - even  in\r\n\r\nboom  times some companies have to retrench.  However, we expect\r\n\r\nthe  numbers to be reduced.  I am glad that some companies  have\r\n\r\nshelved retrenchment plans, because of the cost-cutting package.\r\n\r\nWe  have got this information privately.  We respect the wish of\r\n\r\nthese  companies to remain anonymous, but we are glad that  they\r\n\r\nare acting responsibly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC is pleased that two employer groups - the\r\n\r\nSingapore   National  Employers  Federation  and  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nFederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry - have come  out\r\n\r\nwith  a  five-point action plan to explore new markets,  develop\r\n\r\nnew  capabilities, boost productivity, help the  unemployed  and\r\n\r\nimplement the wage cuts fairly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some economists have commented that the cost-cutting\r\n\r\npackage  does  not address the demand side of the equation.   As\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds of demand is external, what we can do is to lower our\r\n\r\ncosts,  so  that our exports are competitive.  This is precisely\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  done.  What more can we do?  Both the  SNEF  and\r\n\r\nSFCCI  have  said  they  will be more active  in  exploring  new\r\n\r\nmarkets.  If we can improve on our export performance,  then  we\r\n\r\nwill  recover.  This, in turn, will pull up the domestic  sector\r\n\r\nwhich seems to be a focus of speakers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearlier  this  afternoon.  When we recover, there will  be  more\r\n\r\ndemand   for  offices,  factories  and  homes,  and   help   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  sector.  I hope that NMP, Mr  Chuang,  understands\r\n\r\nthat  the  measures help him downstream.  Some of  the  measures\r\n\r\nhelp  construction  companies immediately but  the  full  effect\r\n\r\ncomes  downstream when we have recovered.  So, also  the  retail\r\n\r\nsector.   When  we recover, and the people have  more  money  to\r\n\r\nspend,  then  the  recovery  comes.   And  I  hope  the  present\r\n\r\ndifficulties will spur the construction industry and the  retail\r\n\r\nindustry  to  finally  do  something  about  the  appalling  low\r\n\r\nproductivity in both sectors and in the case of the construction\r\n\r\nindustry, its heavy reliance on unskilled foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my colleague, Mr Lim Swee Say, said yesterday, let\r\n\r\nus  forget about painless solutions.  There will be pain.  It is\r\n\r\nnot  only  poor  company bottom lines, it is also  unemployment.\r\n\r\nThough  unemployment has risen, we are fortunate that there  are\r\n\r\nstill   jobs   available  and  still  adequate.   Although   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Service Department of the Ministry of  Manpower  has\r\n\r\nmore  workers  seeking  jobs than vacancies,  it  is  not  truly\r\n\r\nreflective  of the employment market.  The service  provided  is\r\n\r\npurely  voluntary.  Not all employers register  their  vacancies\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry of Manpower, notwithstanding  the  proactive\r\n\r\nefforts  of the Ministry to seek out those employers  that  have\r\n\r\njobs.   Not  all the unemployed register either.  We know  there\r\n\r\nare  companies  still complaining that they  cannot  get  enough\r\n\r\nSingaporean  workers,  and many sectors have  large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.   In fact, in my meet-the-people  sessions,  I\r\n\r\nstill  get  employers coming to me saying that they  cannot  get\r\n\r\nworkers and asking the Ministry of Manpower to approve the  work\r\n\r\npermits.  Provided workers are flexible in their choice of jobs,\r\n\r\nthey  can  find a job.  Of course, the performance of  the  job-matching  efforts can be improved.  And we will  do  so  through\r\n\r\ntripartite effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I must point out that older workers find\r\n\r\nit  harder  to  find a job.  Some say that older workers  expect\r\n\r\nhigher  pay.   Yes,  this  is  one  reason.    They  have   more\r\n\r\ncommitments, but they will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadjust.   What  I think is an equally difficult problem  is  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of employers towards older workers.  A mindset  change\r\n\r\nis  needed.   So  I  call on employers to give older  workers  a\r\n\r\nchance, and I hope the employers' organisations will do more  to\r\n\r\npersuade their members to give older workers a chance.   I  know\r\n\r\nthat many have expressed concern over low income workers out  of\r\n\r\nwork.   But  I  think, today, there is also a  very  significant\r\n\r\nproblem  of  the better educated executives who lose their  jobs\r\n\r\nand who find it difficult to find re-employment.  So I hope that\r\n\r\nthey too will be given a chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is natural that the focus of Members has been on\r\n\r\nrestoring our competitiveness.  Most Members have focused on the\r\n\r\ncurrent  business cost problem.  Few have touched on the future,\r\n\r\nexcept  perhaps the speakers earlier today.  But that  forms  an\r\n\r\nimportant part of the CSC Report.  The CSC recommendations  also\r\n\r\nmap  out  the  future  we want.  It is a  future  based  on  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  economy,  of creating higher  value,  which  in  turn\r\n\r\nprovides workers with higher pay and not lower pay.  Our  future\r\n\r\ndoes not lie in keeping our wage costs down to the same level as\r\n\r\nour  neighbours.  Our ambition has always been  to  create  more\r\n\r\nwealth  per  person, to give our people a better life  than  our\r\n\r\nneighbours.  That is why our wage levels are now higher.  If  we\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  moving  into a knowledge economy,  let  us  not  be\r\n\r\nsurprised that our wages will be even higher, compared with  our\r\n\r\nneighbors.   But the important thing is this higher  wage  level\r\n\r\nmust  be  supported  by the higher wealth we  create;  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, by higher productivity overall and that is what we aim to\r\n\r\ndo.   Unfortunately,  because of the pressing  problems  of  the\r\n\r\ndownturn,  there has not been adequate discussion and debate  in\r\n\r\nthis House on the other recommendations of the CSC Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that over the next few months, we\r\n\r\nwill  have  more  opportunity in this House  to  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nvarious  recommendations that have been set out.   Now  that  we\r\n\r\nhave settled what we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  do,  let  us go forward, implement the wage  cuts,  pull\r\n\r\ntogether  as  one  nation and come out of  this  as  quickly  as\r\n\r\npossible and then move forward into the knowledge economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I seek clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister  without  Portfolio?   In  his  speech,   he\r\n\r\nmentioned that there is a need to announce a percentage cut as a\r\n\r\nguideline, so that non-unionised workers will know how much  cut\r\n\r\nis   reasonable.   What  about  some  employers  who  take  this\r\n\r\nguideline as an opportunity to cut, even though the company  may\r\n\r\nstill be competitive and there is no need to cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification is: why is there a need to mandate\r\n\r\na  10%  cut  in  CPF?   Why not leave it to  the  company  as  a\r\n\r\nguideline for a cut in wages rather than a CPF cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Sir, what happens if a non-unionised\r\n\r\nemployer takes advantage?  I think a non-unionised employer  has\r\n\r\nto  act responsibly.  While there may be no effective monitoring\r\n\r\nsystem to prevent such abuse, if such employers are shortsighted\r\n\r\nand take advantage, what would be the cost?  I think unhappiness\r\n\r\nwithin their companies and a breakdown of trust between employee\r\n\r\nand  employer.  When the recovery comes, people will  vote  with\r\n\r\ntheir  feet.   So whilst we may not have an effective  check  on\r\n\r\nsuch employers, I think it is prudent to sound out a warning  to\r\n\r\nthem that if they do so, it is to their own cost in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards why it is necessary to mandate a 10% CPF cut, if\r\n\r\nwe  want to touch the CPF, it is a blunt instrument.  If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot want to mandate a cut across the board, then we have to rely\r\n\r\non  cuts purely on the wage system.  I think that burden will be\r\n\r\ntoo high for our workers to bear.  So if we have to cut part  of\r\n\r\nit  from  the CPF, then we have to mandate this 10% cut  in  the\r\n\r\nCPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. How about\r\n\r\ncutting the employee's contribution in CPF so that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey   can  tide  over  the  period  and  allow  companies   the\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  decide  on  the  correct  percentage  of   wage\r\n\r\ndeduction that will make them competitive, rather than a mandate\r\n\r\nacross  the  board  of  a 10% CPF cut, whether  the  company  is\r\n\r\nprofitable or competitive, it is a 10% CPF cut?  Give some money\r\n\r\nback  to  the  workers and allow companies some  flexibility  in\r\n\r\ndeciding.  Do you not think this would be a better alternative?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Boon Heng:</b> Sir, this has also been explained by the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Manpower.  The focus is on reducing costs  to  the\r\n\r\nemployer.   That is why we cut the employer's CPF  contribution,\r\n\r\nand  not  the employee's.   Give money back to the employees  by\r\n\r\ncutting   the  employee's  contribution  and  give   them   more\r\n\r\ndisposable  income, I think that would only be necessary  if  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  far  severe recession than now.  What workers  are  now\r\n\r\nfacing  is  a  reduction  of disposable  income,  not  15%,  but\r\n\r\nsomewhere in the region of 7%.  So I think this is at the moment\r\n\r\nstill  bearable.   If more companies were to pass  back  savings\r\n\r\nwhich  they  get from the various cost cutting measures  to  the\r\n\r\nconsumer, then, in fact, the effect is less than the 7%  cut  in\r\n\r\ndisposable income.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the motion standing in the name of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nTrade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to thank Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\r\n\r\nfor presenting the Government's response to the CSC Report.   It\r\n\r\nunderscores  what  the international news  media  and  the  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers  are  saying:  that the Singapore  Government  has  the\r\n\r\ntalent  and  the  vision to deal effectively  with  the  current\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis.  Our national leaders have amply  demonstrated\r\n\r\nand  exercised  leadership  and statesmanship  in  handling  the\r\n\r\neconomic  problems we have.  All Singaporeans would, I am  sure,\r\n\r\njoin us in thanking the Government for the cost cutting package,\r\n\r\nincluding the generous Government rebates and tax cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Government is refraining from\r\n\r\ncutting  the  monthly wages of the junior staff in Division  III\r\n\r\nand IV\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlevels  and  the  daily-rated employees.  This  shows  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is considerate and mindful of the needs of the junior\r\n\r\nstaff  and  the  lower income group.  This is  indeed  a  caring\r\n\r\nGovernment in action, lest we forget.  I hope the private sector\r\n\r\ncompanies  will also take this into consideration when  they  do\r\n\r\ntheir own wage adjustments, especially for their junior staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government Ministers will forgo the\r\n\r\nnormal  annual salary adjustment for a second year  running  and\r\n\r\ninstead take a 10% pay cut.  Our Ministers are indeed leading by\r\n\r\nexample.  We must all be thankful that we in Singapore have such\r\n\r\ngood  Ministers, whereas in many other countries  they  have  so\r\n\r\nmany problems with the economy and the leadership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no choice but to cut costs, in order to be\r\n\r\ncompetitive against other competing economies.  There is no cure\r\n\r\nwithout  some  pain.  But the Government, we  can  see  by  this\r\n\r\npackage,  is  trying its best to cushion the impact,  especially\r\n\r\nfor the lower income groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4% out of the 10% CPF cut will come from the Special Account,\r\n\r\nand  CPF members will further be allowed to use the balances  in\r\n\r\ntheir  Special  Accounts  to  meet  any  shortfall  in  mortgage\r\n\r\nrepayment caused by the CPF cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Government is trying its utmost to help\r\n\r\nhomeowners can be seen in two other schemes: first, the HDB will\r\n\r\nallow deferment of mortgage payments, lengthening of the term of\r\n\r\nthe mortgage loans, and inclusion of more working family members\r\n\r\nas joint owners for the purpose of payment.  Second, there is  a\r\n\r\nBridging  Loan  Scheme  for CPF holders  with  HDB  and  private\r\n\r\nproperty  mortgages at the concessionary rate  of  CPF  interest\r\n\r\nrate  plus 0.1%.  This is indeed a very attractive and  generous\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public, I am sure, would also welcome the GST\r\n\r\noffsets,   utilities  rebates,  public  transport  rebates   and\r\n\r\nreduction in hospital charges.  All these will, I am sure, go  a\r\n\r\nlong  way  to help the lower income groups, especially those  in\r\n\r\nthe HDB heartland.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some are puzzled or may not understand why, when we have\r\n\r\nretrenchment and unemployment, we are establishing the Singapore\r\n\r\nTalent  and Recruitment (STAR) Committee, chaired by  BG  George\r\n\r\nYeo.  They may forget that Singapore is not a big country with a\r\n\r\nhuge hinterland and, in truth, we are a city state, aiming to be\r\n\r\na global city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move forward and compete, we have to attract the best talents\r\n\r\nfrom abroad.  In fact, we need more stars.  Let there be a star-studded  Singapore, whether the stars are local born or overseas\r\n\r\ninducted.  Many of our first generation leaders like Dr Toh Chin\r\n\r\nChye, Mr Ong Pang Boon and Mr S. Rajaratnam were indeed inducted\r\n\r\nfrom abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good overseas talents, with their skills, ideas and inventions,\r\n\r\nwill enable Singapore to compete successfully and thereby create\r\n\r\nmore  jobs  for  all Singaporeans.  Even a superpower  like  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  of  America, benefited from wave  upon  wave  of\r\n\r\nimmigrants,  who  contributed immensely  with  their  ideas  and\r\n\r\ninventions to the American economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some businessmen are saying that the CPF and wage cuts are not\r\n\r\ndeep  enough.   They want another 5 or more percentage  cut.   I\r\n\r\nthink enough is enough.  I am glad that the Government is taking\r\n\r\na  balanced  approach on this.  Further cuts, I am afraid,  will\r\n\r\ndrastically cut cash flow and our purchasing power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be adverse effects if more and more held back from\r\n\r\nbuying or have their purchasing power curtailed, and there  will\r\n\r\nbe a contraction, instead of a multiplier effect.  There will be\r\n\r\nless  money  to go around.  We definitely do not  want  that  to\r\n\r\nhappen.  Many people will then say, \"Money no enough.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social fabric and cohesiveness will also be damaged.\r\n\r\nIn  the formula, it is possible to cushion the effects of  these\r\n\r\ncuts   with  the  NTUC  package,  and  the  Government  measures\r\n\r\nannounced so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC has set the pace with a $23 million aid package for\r\n\r\nworkers,  especially to help those in the lower income brackets.\r\n\r\nNTUC Fairprice has cut prices significantly at its supermarkets,\r\n\r\nwhile  NTUC  Income  has a $12 million package  to  help  policy\r\n\r\nholders  to  tide over their payments for premiums  and  housing\r\n\r\nloans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the constituency level we, as Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nwill do our very best to do placement service for those out of\r\n\r\njob, award bursaries and help out those who are in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the private sector companies going to do to help\r\n\r\nthe  workers to match the measures launched by NTUC?  I am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore  National  Employers  Federation  and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry  have\r\n\r\nannounced   that  they  will  step  up  workers'  training   and\r\n\r\nretraining  and assist in job placement.  The question  is,  can\r\n\r\nthe employers do more?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the employers do now, or will not do, will settle the\r\n\r\nlong  term  relationship with the workers and unions.   For  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  our  long  term competitiveness and  our  future,  the\r\n\r\nemployers  must  be seen to be proactive in helping  workers  in\r\n\r\nthis   economic  crisis.   In  a  way,  they  will  be   helping\r\n\r\nthemselves, if they could secure the loyalty and support of  the\r\n\r\nworkers, and motivate them to give their best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Mr Tan Chin Tuan, the former Chairman of OCBC\r\n\r\nBank,   celebrated   his  90th  birthday.   His   grand-daughter\r\n\r\nremembered  that  he  taught her that there were  principles  in\r\n\r\nmaking  money,  and  that making money was  not  everything.   I\r\n\r\nsincerely hope, and urge, all our entrepreneurs and businessmen,\r\n\r\nto  abide by these wise precepts of Mr Tan Chin Tuan, which were\r\n\r\nforged  and tempered by years of experience in both the  private\r\n\r\nand public sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those at the helm of business should, in times of crisis\r\n\r\nlike  this,  uphold and cherish our workers, who are making  the\r\n\r\nsupreme  sacrifices  in CPF cuts and wage  cuts,  and  some  are\r\n\r\nindeed losing their jobs.  Companies should think long term  and\r\n\r\ntry to retain, retrain and redeploy the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers,  rather than simply retrench them, if they  could  help\r\n\r\nit.   If  we  simply cut, and cut off the workers, we  will  not\r\n\r\nretain their loyalty and support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrepreneurs will do well to follow the example of Mr\r\n\r\nSim Wong Hoo of Creative Technology, who has pledged to keep the\r\n\r\nmoney  saved  from  the  CPF cuts for possible  distribution  as\r\n\r\nincentive or variable bonus, if the company's targets  are  met.\r\n\r\nMr  Sim  calls  it the Creative CPF Bonus Plan.   I  hope  other\r\n\r\nemployers will also do likewise and do this creatively.  I  urge\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  do  well  and are profitable  to  reward  their\r\n\r\nworkers accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thank the Government for the cuts and rebates in\r\n\r\nGovernment  charges,  like foreign worker levies,  HDB  and  JTC\r\n\r\nfactory  rentals, income tax, property tax, utilities and  other\r\n\r\nservice charges.  I hope that this will indeed start a trend  or\r\n\r\nhabit  for  Government agencies to review their cost structures,\r\n\r\nto put all aspects of costs under scrutiny, and examine ways and\r\n\r\nmeans  of cost savings, eg, higher productivity, automation  and\r\n\r\nlower  head  counts.  The Government agencies can then  pass  on\r\n\r\nthese savings to the customers and the public regularly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good that we are debating this CSC Report and\r\n\r\ndeciding  how best to tackle the economic crisis in a  cool  and\r\n\r\ncalm  manner in this Chamber and not in the streets,  unlike  in\r\n\r\nsome other countries where there are riots and demonstrations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speaks volumes of our tripartite consensus making\r\n\r\nprocess, of our internal cohesion, and the clear vision and high\r\n\r\ncalibre  of our national leaders.  Mind you, this is  not  self-praise.   It  would  be immodest of us to  do  so.   Praise  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  our  Singaporean way of handling  the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis,  came from some unexpected quarters, from those who  are\r\n\r\nquick to criticise us and who have been our constant critics  in\r\n\r\nthe  past.   It came no less, for example, from the Far  Eastern\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  magazine.  If I may quote from  our  erstwhile\r\n\r\ncritic,  the Far Eastern Economic Review stated in its September\r\n\r\n1998 issue:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore's quick, organised response to Malaysia's financial\r\n\r\nshutdown  could  solidify its place as Southeast Asia's  premier\r\n\r\nfinancial centre.  This demonstrated Singapore's reputation  for\r\n\r\nlong-term   planning,  a  trait  that  complements   Singapore's\r\n\r\nreputation for efficiency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed vindication and endorsement of our transparent,\r\n\r\nnon-corrupt,  honest system of Government, and our  emphasis  on\r\n\r\ntalent and meritocracy, where the best and brightest rise to the\r\n\r\ntop in the Government and in business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newsweek, an international news magazine, reported, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore, known for its stable, transparent and clean\r\n\r\nGovernment, has managed the financial storm . while remaining  a\r\n\r\nplayer  in  the global market.  The key: unflappable  government\r\n\r\nofficials, long term planning and prudent fiscal policies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the South China Morning Post, we compare very well\r\n\r\nwith  Hong  Kong,  our nearest rival.  The Hong  Kong  newspaper\r\n\r\ncontrasted  Singapore's  free market  approach  to  Hong  Kong's\r\n\r\ndecision to intervene in the financial markets.  The South China\r\n\r\nMorning  Post commented that Singapore, on the other  hand,  has\r\n\r\nwon credit for demonstrating a cool, calm and collected response\r\n\r\nto  the  region's stormy financial climate and putting in  place\r\n\r\npositive long term structural changes, even as its stock  market\r\n\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CSC has done a good job. The question is how to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  economic  trends  are monitored  constantly  and  new\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  devised to meet ever changing circumstances.   We\r\n\r\nmust  make  sure that this tripartite mechanism and relationship\r\n\r\nforged in the economic crisis is maintained and indeed geared up\r\n\r\nto  meet any new problems so that problems can be nipped in  the\r\n\r\nbud.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not let such mechanism atrophy. We should not wait\r\n\r\naround  for  another  crisis before calling  for  a  review  and\r\n\r\nanother competitiveness report.  We should keep the mechanism in\r\n\r\nplace,  keep  monitoring the trends and be always ahead  and  be\r\n\r\nmore competitive than our immediate neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest therefore that the Government consider keeping the\r\n\r\nCSC or some moderated form of the CSC intact, by emplacing it in\r\n\r\na  Government agency or a think-tank with a resource  panel  and\r\n\r\ncapacity  for  economic monitoring and analysis.  From  time  to\r\n\r\ntime, Sir, crisis will come, but such a mechanism can enable  us\r\n\r\nto  mark  the  trends and gear up to tackle the new  issues  and\r\n\r\ndevise new strategies and formulas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cost-cutting is only half the story. It would not work if\r\n\r\nproductivity  is  not raised, if workers are not  motivated,  if\r\n\r\nbusiness revenues are not increased, if new businesses  are  not\r\n\r\nfound, and if new markets are not conquered.  All cuts will come\r\n\r\nto nothing. The business itself will be cut off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real challenge therefore to Singapore, and Singaporean\r\n\r\nbusinessmen in particular, is to find new business, to  continue\r\n\r\nto regionalise and globalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need new ideas, new business, new markets and new niches. We\r\n\r\nmust  use this crisis to forge a new spirit of entrepreneurship,\r\n\r\nof  daring to do, of never say die, but to fight and survive  in\r\n\r\nthis  business  jungle.  Darwin would say the  survival  of  the\r\n\r\nfittest in the business jungle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Singaporeans can do it. We can make it. We can make\r\n\r\nit  happen.  Indeed, this economic crisis provides us  with  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to jell as a people as we face the problems squarely\r\n\r\nand  overcome  them.   It bonds the people  and  the  Government\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will emerge stronger, with better credit ratings and even\r\n\r\nmore united and determined to make Singapore an attractive place\r\n\r\nfor investment and financial transaction.  We are well placed to\r\n\r\nbecome  the  global IT, service and financial hub.   So  let  us\r\n\r\nrally  behind  the  Government and go forth  as  one  people  to\r\n\r\ntriumph over adversity and conquer the new markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I  believe that even in the midst of the  monumental\r\n\r\nchanges that have swept us and this region during the last  year\r\n\r\nand a half, it is timely that we review our strategies for long-term  survival  and  growth.  To focus on the  current  problems\r\n\r\nwithout   regard   for   the  long-term   solutions   would   be\r\n\r\nshortsighted, like looking merely at the leaves and  not  seeing\r\n\r\nthe  entire forest.  In trying to overcome the current  economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties, we must not be distracted from pursuing  long-term\r\n\r\npriorities which are required to remain relevant and to  further\r\n\r\nenhance our position in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-term measures have essentially focused on cost\r\n\r\nreduction  to  help  businesses  survive  the  current  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.  I support the urgent need to make immediate adjustments\r\n\r\nto  costs  here  in  order  to adapt  to  the  changed  economic\r\n\r\nenvironment.   The  cost reduction package  announced  yesterday\r\n\r\ntouched  on  a  multitude  of ways in which  business  costs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  could  be  directly and indirectly  reduced  so  that\r\n\r\ncommercial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntransactions could take place more efficiently and without undue\r\n\r\nwastage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the cost reduction measures, crucial as they are,\r\n\r\nduring  this  period  do  not provide  the  be-all  and  end-all\r\n\r\nsolution to the problems faced by our businesses and to increase\r\n\r\ntheir  competitiveness.   The  cost-cutting  measures  are  only\r\n\r\ntemporary  holding  measures  to give  as  many  enterprises  as\r\n\r\npossible  a fighting chance to survive in the interim.   Workers\r\n\r\nare prepared to accept and adopt these measures despite the pain\r\n\r\nthat  will result, but bosses must realise that their businesses\r\n\r\ncannot  depend on cost-cutting alone to survive this crisis  and\r\n\r\nexpect to emerge stronger thereafter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, it is clear, even without the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis,  that  the  only way to achieve a  globally  competitive\r\n\r\nposition  is for businesses to undergo structural reforms  which\r\n\r\nare not merely based on price but on quality and added value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main causes for the fall in revenue for most\r\n\r\ncompanies is, of course, the reduced demand for their goods  and\r\n\r\nservices in the domestic and regional markets.  The thing  which\r\n\r\nemployers  cannot  afford  to do now is  to  simply  sit  tight,\r\n\r\nparalysed  with  ignorance  and  uncertainty  into  wishing  and\r\n\r\nwaiting for the good times to return, hoping in the meantime for\r\n\r\nmore  cost-cutting measures to be initiated by  the  Government.\r\n\r\nAs  the Chinese saying goes, a raft in the rapids that does  not\r\n\r\nmove  forward  moves  backwards.  Even with  reduced  costs,  if\r\n\r\nnothing  is done to counter the drop in revenue, profit  margins\r\n\r\nwould  diminish and eventually disappear if revenue falls  below\r\n\r\nexpenses, and that business will eventually die, although  at  a\r\n\r\nslower pace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses must therefore find ways to tap new markets and\r\n\r\nincrease  revenue.   They must be nimble and responsive  to  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the market and to the consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a simple example, in telecommunications, the Internet is\r\n\r\nchanging  the way we communicate and the way we source  for  and\r\n\r\nretrieve information in a very fundamental way.  During a recent\r\n\r\nvisit  to the United States, I was pleasantly surprised to  find\r\n\r\npublic  telephones which had a separate built-in  data  port  so\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexecutives  on  the  move could plug in their laptop  computers.\r\n\r\nAnd with a mere drop of a quarter, ie, 25 cents, they could dial\r\n\r\ninto  their  head  office's  computer  or  an  Internet  Service\r\n\r\nProvider,  retrieve their e-mails, communicate with head  office\r\n\r\nand  friends, and even surf the World Wide Web.  During the last\r\n\r\nfew  days, I examined every public phone I came across,  whether\r\n\r\nat  Changi  Airport or Raffles Place, but had not been  able  to\r\n\r\nfind  one  which allowed me to plug in my portable  computer  to\r\n\r\nsend an e-mail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the recommendations by the Committee that\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and  services should  be  promoted  as  the  twin\r\n\r\nengines  of  growth.   Today,  I would  like  to  focus  on  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.  Before I proceed further, I would like to\r\n\r\ndisclose  my interest in the subject as a director of  a  public\r\n\r\nlisted  electronics  contract manufacturer and  a  director  and\r\n\r\nequity  contributor of a start-up technology company.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to bring up three points.  The first is for a review of the\r\n\r\nGST  structure to facilitate part of the manufacturing processes\r\n\r\nto  be  carried  out in neighbouring countries.   Second,  local\r\n\r\ncontract  manufacturers must be encouraged to provide more  than\r\n\r\nmerely  a manufacturing service.  And, third, meeting the  needs\r\n\r\nof  existing MNCs that have already invested here in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the  relevant Ministries and Government  agencies  will\r\n\r\nconsider these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as a manufacturing centre, our land limitation and highly\r\n\r\nskilled workforce have made us too expensive to manufacture  and\r\n\r\nassemble  the entire product in Singapore.  I do not believe  we\r\n\r\nshould  even  try  to  do so.  While we  may  have  the  skilled\r\n\r\nworkforce  to  do some parts of the assembly work  that  require\r\n\r\nhigher technology, the low-tech components must be farmed out to\r\n\r\nbe  done elsewhere, like Johor and Batam, so that we can finally\r\n\r\nput  them altogether here in Singapore for export.  This was the\r\n\r\noriginal idea behind the growth triangle.  However, one obstacle\r\n\r\nto  this being carried out in practice is the imposition of  the\r\n\r\ngoods and services tax (GST).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain Singapore's position as a manufacturing hub, I\r\n\r\nbelieve we should refine the present GST structure in regard  to\r\n\r\nimport  of  semi-finished  products.   Under  the  present   GST\r\n\r\nstructure, unless a particular supply of goods into Singapore is\r\n\r\nmeant  for re-export or falls under one of the approved schemes,\r\n\r\nlike  the  bonded warehouse scheme, GST will be payable  by  the\r\n\r\nimporter  on the supply.  This does not accommodate the practice\r\n\r\nof   manufacturers  who  carry  out  certain  stages  of   their\r\n\r\nproduction  process  outside  Singapore.   When  the   works-in-progress  are  sent  back to Singapore after completion  of  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  process, these manufacturers will be required  to  pay\r\n\r\nGST  on  the semi-finished products which are considered taxable\r\n\r\nimport  supplies.  Although the GST paid by the manufacturer  at\r\n\r\nthat  point  can  be re-claimed as input tax when  the  finished\r\n\r\ngoods  are subsequently sold or exported, it does mean that  the\r\n\r\nGST paid on the supply of semi-finished products will be tied up\r\n\r\nfor  a  period  of  time.  Although GST is  only  3%,  this  can\r\n\r\nrepresent  a  relatively  sizable  amount,  considering  that  a\r\n\r\ntypical contract manufacturer makes only about 2% to 5%  in  net\r\n\r\nmargins.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is an expedient time to look into possible\r\n\r\nchanges   to  our  GST  structure  so  as  to  help  our   local\r\n\r\nmanufacturers to take advantage of the lower costs of production\r\n\r\nin other countries within the growth triangle framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is that in order to\r\n\r\nprovide  value  and  to increase revenue, our local  electronics\r\n\r\ncontract  manufacturers  must do  more  than  merely  provide  a\r\n\r\nmanufacturing service.  We must rise up the added value chain by\r\n\r\noffering  technological  innovation and  more  complete  product\r\n\r\nsolutions for customers.  There is a global trend towards  third\r\n\r\nparty  out-sourcing.  This provides the opportunity for contract\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  who  have R&D capabilities  to  offer  innovative\r\n\r\nproduct  solutions by suggesting improvements  to  the  existing\r\n\r\nproducts  in  terms of their specifications or by reducing  cost\r\n\r\nthrough new and more efficient production methods.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTaiwanese   are  particularly  good  at  this.    However,   for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it  is  easier said than done.  But  the  tripartite\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  the  big  businesses,  entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nGovernment can be a powerful synergistic force to bring about  a\r\n\r\nchange  in  the  manufacturing industry here.  The entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nwho  have  new  product ideas, the established  businesses  with\r\n\r\ntheir  financial resources and the Government which can  provide\r\n\r\nthe necessary infrastructure and assistance should work together\r\n\r\nin  a  more  concerted and focused way to allow these  ideas  to\r\n\r\nmaterialise into useful and successful products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that Singapore will continue to depend heavily\r\n\r\non  attracting foreign investments here to provide jobs for  our\r\n\r\npeople  and  to  maintain growth.  Besides the workers  who  are\r\n\r\ndirectly employed under the payroll of the MNCs, there are  many\r\n\r\nother workers who are employed by the multitude of companies and\r\n\r\nbusinesses that depend on the MNCs as their suppliers  and  sub-contractors.   However, in this area, we face stiff  competition\r\n\r\nfor  investments and jobs from other places.  For  instance,  in\r\n\r\nthe  consumer  electronics industry, countries and regions  like\r\n\r\nMexico  and Eastern Europe, which are geographically  closer  to\r\n\r\nthe  huge booming consumer markets of USA and Europe, are  being\r\n\r\nconsidered by MNCs as very attractive alternatives for  them  to\r\n\r\nset  up their operations.  Singapore has done well in attracting\r\n\r\nnew  investments  by  MNCs in the past and  should  continue  to\r\n\r\nimaginatively develop and exploit all possible niches which will\r\n\r\nmake us a world class business and financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we are working hard at attracting new foreign direct\r\n\r\ninvestments,  we  should not take for granted those  MNCs  which\r\n\r\nhave   already  sunk  in  their  investments  here.    We   must\r\n\r\nconsistently and constantly review the difficulties  these  MNCs\r\n\r\nface  in their operations in Singapore and ask ourselves whether\r\n\r\nwe  are  doing  enough to meet their needs and to  retain  them.\r\n\r\nShould  these MNCs decide to end their operations here and  move\r\n\r\nelsewhere, they would probably be lost to Singapore forever,  as\r\n\r\nhaving had a bad and painful experience, it will be very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifficult  and will take many years before their top  management\r\n\r\ncan  justify starting up in Singapore again, even if we are able\r\n\r\nto remedy the problems at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that in debating the\r\n\r\nmeasures  that need to be taken, we must not forget that,  as  a\r\n\r\ndeveloping  economy, Singapore has succeeded beyond all  initial\r\n\r\nexpectations  through  the  hard work  of  the  people  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The present crisis then may be seen as  a  test  of\r\n\r\nour  true  strength and potential.  Our actions and the measures\r\n\r\nwe   take   are  constantly  scrutinised  by  foreign  analysts,\r\n\r\neconomists and international investors and the media.   And  the\r\n\r\nconsensus  among  these watchers is that we have  a  very  sound\r\n\r\nsystem that so far has withstood the test of the crisis.   There\r\n\r\nis  every  reason for us to feel confident that the  Government,\r\n\r\nfrom  its  track  record  -  first in  putting  the  system  and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure together, and then, in continuing to maintain its\r\n\r\nsoundness and integrity, will be able to lead Singapore  out  of\r\n\r\nthis  crisis.   With  this confidence, every Singaporean  should\r\n\r\nfeel   able   to   give  his  fullest  support  to   the   CSC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations and the cost reduction package which are  to  be\r\n\r\nadopted by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMMITTEE ON SINGAPORE'S COMPETITIVENESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  for  the  past one year a remark which Singaporeans  often\r\n\r\nmake  in  the coffeeshops has been \"times are bad\".   What  most\r\n\r\npeople talk about are CPF cut, wage cut and whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprices  will go down.  At home, what worries people  is  whether\r\n\r\nthey could keep their jobs as they have seen their own relatives\r\n\r\nand  neighbours retrenched.  Moreover, they worry  whether  they\r\n\r\nhave enough money to service their mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the nation-wide cost-cutting measures\r\n\r\nannounced by DPM Lee yesterday as well as the measures announced\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Manpower, Dr Lee Boon Yang,  in  place,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  can rest assured that things are moving in the  right\r\n\r\ndirection.   After  the  CSC  Report  and  the  National   Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil's recommendations were published, the people's attention\r\n\r\nis  focused  on the various cost-cutting measures,  particularly\r\n\r\nthe  specific  cuts  in  taxes, rentals, CPF  contributions  and\r\n\r\nwages.   In  the  forum  page  of the newspapers,  the  dialogue\r\n\r\nsessions  and  in coffeeshops, we begin to read and  hear  these\r\n\r\nquestions  being asked: \"Has the Government done  enough?   Have\r\n\r\nthe  employers done enough?  Have the unions done enough?   Have\r\n\r\nthe workers done enough?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who mentioned again and again that Ministers\r\n\r\nshould take the lead in having a pay cut.  There are also others\r\n\r\nwho  doubt whether senior management staff in the private sector\r\n\r\nare  willing to take a deeper pay cut.  Some have asked  whether\r\n\r\ncompanies  which are still making profits should be entitled  to\r\n\r\ncut  their  CPF  contributions.   We hope  that  bosses  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  would  be  sensitive  to  the  needs  of  their\r\n\r\nemployees, and would not take this opportunity to exploit  them.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, we also hope that there will not be politics\r\n\r\nof jealousy in our society.  When we are all faced with a common\r\n\r\nproblem,  we should put in a concerted effort to seek  solutions\r\n\r\nto  these  problems.  We should not wait to see who should  make\r\n\r\nmore  sacrifice.   Everyone has to make sacrifice  in  order  to\r\n\r\nenhance our competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, DPM Lee's measures demonstrate another\r\n\r\nspirit  in  our society, that is, we should share good  fortunes\r\n\r\nand  go through thick and thin together.  Now that we are  faced\r\n\r\nwith difficulties, do the Government, employers, unions and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers   know  what  our  difficulties  are?   How  did   these\r\n\r\ndifficulties  come  about?   We should  not  indulge  in  mutual\r\n\r\ncondemnation.  While we share in good fortunes, we  should  also\r\n\r\nbear adversity together.  How do we overcome these difficulties?\r\n\r\nIt  is  obvious.  We should take measures to reduce our business\r\n\r\ncosts.   However,  when  we  resort to cost-cutting,  we  should\r\n\r\nendeavour to minimise the impact on the poor wage-earners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear that petrol companies have announced a\r\n\r\nreduction  in  petrol  prices.   Singapore  Telecom   has   also\r\n\r\nannounced  reductions in IDD charges.  We  sincerely  hope  that\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies and the private sector will do the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the union side, the NTUC launched a $23 million package\r\n\r\nto  help the workers tide over this difficult period.  When this\r\n\r\nscheme  was  launched, one reporter asked whether the  miserable\r\n\r\nprice-cut of 5% to 10% was of any good when people do  not  even\r\n\r\nbother  to stop and pick up a 5-cent coin when they see  one  on\r\n\r\nthe ground.   Having enjoyed the good times all these years, our\r\n\r\npeople have become so casual about small amounts of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would still appeal to businessmen to pass on the\r\n\r\nsavings from the cuts in taxes, rentals and CPF by reducing  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  their goods and services, even if it is just  for  5\r\n\r\ncents  or 10 cents.  If the ordinary people could save 5  to  10\r\n\r\ncents each time they go to work by public transport, shop at the\r\n\r\nsupermarket,  or  to  have a meal at the  hawker  centre,  these\r\n\r\nsavings  when  added  up could amount to something  significant.\r\n\r\nThis would in some way help to offset the pains inflicted by the\r\n\r\npay  cut  and CPF cut.  In this respect, the NTUC has taken  the\r\n\r\nlead.  I hope the retail sector would also follow suit by giving\r\n\r\ndiscounts  to  their consumers.  The media can  help  by  giving\r\n\r\npublicity to those shops which have reduced their prices.   When\r\n\r\nconsumers know where they could buy things at lower prices, they\r\n\r\nwould  do  their shopping there.  This would lead to more  shops\r\n\r\ngiving  discounts or reducing their prices in order  to  attract\r\n\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this spirit of \"every cent counts\" that we try to imbue\r\n\r\ninto  our  children's  mind when we ask them  to  deposit  their\r\n\r\nsavings  into piggy banks so that before Chinese New Year,  they\r\n\r\ncould  use their savings to buy new clothes and new shoes.   Our\r\n\r\nnational  reserve  is  like a \"piggy bank\".   Some  people  have\r\n\r\nsuggested that we should dig into the national reserves to solve\r\n\r\nour problems.  But I think it is not wise to do so.  I think the\r\n\r\nreserves should be made use of only as a last resort.  To do  so\r\n\r\nis  like  children using a stick to try and dig out a few  coins\r\n\r\nfrom  the  piggy bank to spend.  If there are other options,  we\r\n\r\nshould not dig into the national reserves.  We should turn  this\r\n\r\nspirit into a Singapore spirit.  We should encourage everyone to\r\n\r\nsave.   That  we have a huge reserve is a result of our  savings\r\n\r\nbecause we have enjoyed good times for many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people have become used to living in comfort that they tend\r\n\r\nto  become grumpy when they are suddenly faced with hard  times.\r\n\r\nWe  can understand that.  When the sole breadwinner has lost his\r\n\r\njob  or  when  the  company  has  gone  bankrupt,  we  ought  to\r\n\r\nunderstand their plight and give them a helping hand.  For those\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who have no family members to turn to for help, the\r\n\r\nCDCs  and other self-help organisations should step in to render\r\n\r\nassistance.   Whether  we  are  civil  servants,  employers,  or\r\n\r\ngrassroots   leaders,  we  ought  to  empathise  and   be   more\r\n\r\ncompassionate  with  our  fellow country  men  who  are  now  in\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   I  hope such message could be  conveyed  to  all\r\n\r\nGovernment Ministries.  We hope, through the present crisis,  we\r\n\r\ncould  become  more  vigilant and be  more  able  to  cope  with\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me cite a real life example that shows\r\n\r\nhow  a long period of prosperity can cause our people to be less\r\n\r\nable  to  cope with adverse circumstances.  Nowadays,  more  and\r\n\r\nmore  housing estates have covered walkways to link their blocks\r\n\r\nto  the bus stops and to shield them from rain and the hot  sun.\r\n\r\nHowever, one resident complained to me that there was no covered\r\n\r\nwalkway near his block and that it was very hot to walk  to  the\r\n\r\nbus stop at noon and when it rains, he could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  go  to the bus stop.  But this resident has forgotten  that\r\n\r\nduring  the  time  when there were no such  facilities,  no  one\r\n\r\ncomplained  that he or she could not walk to the bus stop,  rain\r\n\r\nor  shine.  What you need to do is to walk faster or to bring an\r\n\r\numbrella  when  it  rains.  He seemed  to  have  forgotten  this\r\n\r\ninstinct  of  coping with changes. A long period  of  prosperity\r\n\r\ncould  bring  about such negative effects on the mettle  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.   It is hoped that the present crisis could lead  us  to\r\n\r\nrealise  the  importance of how to survive through hardship  and\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the \"every cent counts\" spirit is\r\n\r\nmanifested in the various recommendations in the CSC Report.   I\r\n\r\nsupport the motion standing in the name of the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I met a few workers when I went to my office this morning.\r\n\r\nI  took the opportunity to ask them what they thought about  the\r\n\r\ncost-reduction  package  introduced by  DPM  Lee  in  Parliament\r\n\r\nyesterday.

Then we will be very happy.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three things came to my mind. First, they said, \"Oh, lucky, no\r\n\r\nneed  to  cut  salary  and I still get to receive  the  year-end\r\n\r\nbonus.\"  This proves that when accepting the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe  CSC, the Government has carefully considered the plight  of\r\n\r\nour  workers,  and they have also listened to the feedback  from\r\n\r\nthe  MPs and the public.  I would like to commend our Government\r\n\r\nfor  making the right decision in not having involved our lower-income employees in this round of wage reduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSecondly, they said, \"Yes, we knew that our CPF is going  to  be\r\n\r\ncut by 10%.\"  On this point, it also proves that our labour MPs,\r\n\r\nthe NTUC and union leaders have done a good job in explaining to\r\n\r\nthe  workers  the rationale for this round of CPF  reduction  so\r\n\r\nthat  all the workers understand why this cut is necessary.   So\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Government announced that the CPF would  be  reduced,\r\n\r\nthey accepted it spontaneously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, when they asked me whether I could ask the shopkeepers\r\n\r\nto  bring down the prices of goods, it shows that after reducing\r\n\r\ncosts  for  the business, the next thing to do is to reduce  the\r\n\r\ncost of living.  So today, I will focus on this point, that  is,\r\n\r\nhereafter,  how are we going to help the people of Singapore  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  have a better standard of living and our quality  of\r\n\r\nlife will not be affected by this economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this, I hereby urge all trade associations,\r\n\r\ncoffeeshop  owners'  associations and retailers  to  join  in  a\r\n\r\nnation-wide sales campaign.  Our Singapore Government  has  been\r\n\r\nvery  successful  in promoting various campaigns,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nSpeak  Mandarin  Campaign, the Courtesy  Campaign,  the  Healthy\r\n\r\nLifestyle  Campaign, etc.  We have achieved very  good  results.\r\n\r\nAt  this point of time, it may be appropriate for us to  have  a\r\n\r\n\"National Sales Campaign\".  Why should we have a National  Sales\r\n\r\nCampaign?  Because I think we can achieve three objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we can offset the additional burden imposed on our\r\n\r\nworkers due to wage-cut measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Christmas, Chinese New Year and Hari Raya are coming.\r\n\r\nWith all these festivals coming, if we can have a National Sales\r\n\r\nCampaign, it will also help to stimulate business activities  so\r\n\r\nthat our economy could recover faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, through this National Sales Campaign, coupled with\r\n\r\npropaganda  by  our Government agencies such  as  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTourism  Board,   we  could  attract more  tourists  from  other\r\n\r\ncountries\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  visit  us.   At a time when the other countries  are  having\r\n\r\nproblems, we can attract tourists to come to Singapore and  shop\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that with these three objectives in mind, we would be\r\n\r\nable  to  herald in some good news during this time  of  crisis.\r\n\r\nHowever, to promote such a campaign, we need to have the support\r\n\r\nand  help  from all the traders.  When I spoke to a  coffee-shop\r\n\r\nowner about the campaign, he told me, \"If I reduce 10 cents from\r\n\r\neach  cup  of coffee, with a thousand cups of coffee sold  every\r\n\r\nday,  my daily income will be reduced by $100.  However, if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would reduce our property tax, rental, transportation\r\n\r\ncharges,   we  would  gladly  participate  in  this   campaign.\"\r\n\r\nEventually,  he  agreed  to  participate  in  the  Bukit  Gombak\r\n\r\nConstituency Sales which we are planning to have just before the\r\n\r\nNew Year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This National Sales Campaign can help the lower-income families\r\n\r\nto  reduce their cost of living.  However, if we want to do  it,\r\n\r\nwe  must  do it in full strength.  I remember once I   consulted\r\n\r\nMinister George Yeo on a certain project. After listening to me,\r\n\r\nhe  said,  \"If you feel that you are doing the right  thing,  go\r\n\r\nahead and do it.  I will support you.\"  This signal that he gave\r\n\r\nto  me  was a great encouragement to me.  He gave me  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  and  courage.   Here, I  would  like  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to tell  the traders, the coffeeshop owners, \"If you\r\n\r\nthink  you are doing the right thing, do not be afraid, go ahead\r\n\r\nand  do it!\"   Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  Only then, can\r\n\r\nwe  get  good results.  The National Sales Campaign may  not  be\r\n\r\nrestricted only to the retailers, even the banks can join in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that the Minister for Finance mentioned in a\r\n\r\ntelevision  interview that the banks are going to  reduce  their\r\n\r\ninterest  rates.  If  that is so, the banks might just  as  well\r\n\r\njoin us in this National Sales Campaign, by announcing a cut  in\r\n\r\nthe  lending rates.   I think if the bank loan interest rate  is\r\n\r\nlowered,  the property market will pick up, and our shares index\r\n\r\ncan break through the 1,500 mark.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It has already breached 1,500.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It has already done so?\r\n\r\nThen,  let us go for the 1,600 mark.  I believe that if  we  can\r\n\r\nput  in  a concerted effort, with cooperation between the people\r\n\r\nand the Government, we can achieve some good results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to talk about the foreign worker levy. As\r\n\r\nthe DPM has already mentioned, the foreign maid levy will not be\r\n\r\nlowered,  and  I understand the rationale behind  it.   However,\r\n\r\nduring  a dialogue session of the Feedback Unit, someone  raised\r\n\r\nthe  point that since some tax reliefs are already in place  for\r\n\r\nworking  mothers to offset the levy, why not extend this benefit\r\n\r\nto the husbands as well.   As taxpayers can enjoy tax reliefs up\r\n\r\nto  $8,280 per year for a foreign maid, it may not be a bad idea\r\n\r\nto  let  the husband and wife claim the relief between them,  so\r\n\r\nlong  as  it  falls within this ceiling of $8,280.  Whether  the\r\n\r\nhusband claims or the wife claims, so long as it does not exceed\r\n\r\n$8,280, there is no loss to the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the levy on HDB resale flats. Dr Vasoo has raised\r\n\r\nthis and the Parliamentary Secretary has already explained.  But\r\n\r\nI  still hope that HDB would re-consider this matter and   allow\r\n\r\nthose  who  are living in three-room flats to upgrade to  bigger\r\n\r\nflats  without having to pay the high resale levy.  Let me quote\r\n\r\nan  example.   In  1997, a three-room flat  could  be  sold  for\r\n\r\n$160,000.  To upgrade, the owner would have applied for a  four-room flat which was then sold at about $150,000 by HDB.  But now\r\n\r\nthree-room flats in the western part of Singapore are selling at\r\n\r\njust  $110,000, a drop of some $50,000.  At the same  time,  the\r\n\r\napplicant  is  required  to pay a 20% resale  levy  of  $22,000.\r\n\r\nThus, the applicant is left with very little money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that HDB would consider helping these people who want to\r\n\r\nupgrade but are now being caught in this economic downturn.   At\r\n\r\nthe  moment, for a three-room flat, you pay 20%; for a four-room\r\n\r\nflat,  you  pay 22.5%; and for a five-room flat and  above,  the\r\n\r\nresale  levy is 25%.   I suggest that we reduce the levy by  5%.\r\n\r\nLet the resale levy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  a  three-room flat be 15%; four-room flat, 17.5%; five-room\r\n\r\nflat  and executive condominium, 20%.  In the early days,  those\r\n\r\nwho  sold a three-room flat paid only 10% in levy.  It has  been\r\n\r\nincreased to 15%, and then 20%.  Now that the tide has gone down\r\n\r\nbut  the  boat is still so high up, I think we should allow  the\r\n\r\nboat  to  go  down with the tide.  Let us follow the  trend.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  more equitable that way.  I hope  that  HDB  will\r\n\r\nconsider this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is on building up world-class companies and improving the competitiveness of our local\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  the international market.  This is  a  very  far-sighted  and  creative  approach recommended  by  the  CSC.   It\r\n\r\nrecommended  that many small companies could merge  together  to\r\n\r\nform  a  big  company.   But we all know that  in  our  oriental\r\n\r\nsociety,  it  is very difficult  for two or three  companies  to\r\n\r\nmerge.   In the past it was difficult, now it is also not  easy.\r\n\r\nEven  in  the  future,  I  do not think the  prospect  is  good.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Government can take the lead to form a company  and\r\n\r\nthen invite all the companies in the same trade to join in like,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  Temasek  Holdings.  We  can  invite  these  small\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  join  in, help each other and  then  form  a  big\r\n\r\ncompany  with strong foundation. After that, invite bankers  and\r\n\r\nfinancial institutes to join in and give financial support,  and\r\n\r\nthen we have a huge local company which can be developed into  a\r\n\r\nworld-class company to venture overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the views and feedback from some of the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.   They say, \"Cooperating with Government  companies\r\n\r\ncan  be  very  frustrating because the civil  servants  who  are\r\n\r\nrunning  the  business are often too rigid and inflexible.\"    I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that if we set up such a company and it is managed\r\n\r\nby  civil  servants,   let them take care of administration  and\r\n\r\nfinance.   But  when it comes to sales, business dealings,  etc,\r\n\r\nleave   it  to  the  businessmen  to  do  it.   Because  between\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,  they  speak  their own  language.  Only  they  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  nuances in the language they use.    We  should\r\n\r\ntake advantage of their expertise in this area. For example,  if\r\n\r\nyou talk business with people in certain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountries,  whenever you start negotiating, they will ask you to\r\n\r\ncheng  shang  ming  biao  lai.    To the bureaucratic  Singapore\r\n\r\ncivil   servants,  this  simply  means,  submit  your  company's\r\n\r\nprofile.   But, in fact, what they really meant was \"present  us\r\n\r\nwith branded watches.\"   When you squarely submit your company's\r\n\r\nprofile, it will most probably end up in the wastepaper  basket.\r\n\r\nBut,  if  you are smart enough to hand in your Rolex  or  Omega,\r\n\r\nyour  chances of success are definitely better. If it is  a  big\r\n\r\nproject  that  can bring in big money for you,  it  is  probably\r\n\r\nworth the while entertaining them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you have cheng shang ming biao (presented them with\r\n\r\nbranded  watches), the next thing is, they will  invite  you  to\r\n\r\nyanjiu,  yanjiu, which on the surface sounds like \"consider  and\r\n\r\ndiscuss\", but in fact it is just another hint for you to send in\r\n\r\nthe  yan  (tobacco) and jiu (liquor).   Toe the line,  make  the\r\n\r\nright  move, and you get the contract.  If not, then it  is  too\r\n\r\nbad, you are out of contention!   If you want to deal with these\r\n\r\nforeign  businessmen, you need to have a tacit understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe  way they operate.  This is something our law-abiding  civil\r\n\r\nservants  cannot do.  But our businessmen can do it.   They  are\r\n\r\nthe experts.  They know how to talk business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has been far-sighted in recommending the eight long-term\r\n\r\nstrategies.  It is not possible for me to go into every  one  of\r\n\r\nthem.   Of  course, we may have other opportunities in a  future\r\n\r\nforum to discuss all these.  Here, suffice for me to say that  I\r\n\r\nsupport  the  recommendations put forward by the  Committee.   I\r\n\r\nlike    to   thank   the   Government   for   accepting    these\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  In  the  past,  many  people  used   to   say,\r\n\r\n\"Whatever  recommendation that is made, once  you  come  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  they will dilute it by 40%.\"  But  this  time,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  not  dilute it.   As  a  matter  of  fact,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment enhanced it. The Committee recommended cost-reduction\r\n\r\nof  $10 billion but the Government gave another $500 million  to\r\n\r\nmake it a $10.5 billion package.   This is indeed unprecedented!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to you for\r\n\r\ngiving  me this opportunity.  Sir, I rise to support the  motion\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Minister.   Allow  me  to  share  some  of   the\r\n\r\nobservations which I am going to make this afternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report is bold and imaginative. Some of our best\r\n\r\nminds  in  the  Government, the private sector and the  academia\r\n\r\nhave  worked long hours to put up this Report.  Those of us  who\r\n\r\nhave  read this Report feel a sense of gratitude in the way they\r\n\r\nhave   confronted   the  issues.  The  Report   is   farsighted,\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and well written.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask this House to acknowledge the contributions\r\n\r\nmade  by  all the people involved in the Report, from  the  main\r\n\r\nCommittee to the sub-committees.  It is interesting to note that\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  members  are from the private  sector.   This  is\r\n\r\nencouraging.   It shows the Government's faith  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  and this faith has been well rewarded.  This is  not  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  White  Paper,  but  largely  a  product  of  private\r\n\r\nsector's efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the goals set out in the Report are achievable. We\r\n\r\nall  have  to  work for it.  We are fortunate  that  our  fiscal\r\n\r\nmanagement and budgetary measures have left us surplus  in  good\r\n\r\nyears to meet the difficult years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is some pessimism in some sectors that the\r\n\r\npresent  economic slowdown will last for a few years.  Some  say\r\n\r\nit  is the worst - and I agree with them - economic crisis  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  facing.   Only  time will tell  how  long  the  present\r\n\r\ncondition will last.  Much depends on our neighbours as well  as\r\n\r\non Japan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am more optimistic. We can be masters of our own\r\n\r\ndestiny.   The acid test of a society comes in times of  crisis.\r\n\r\nWe  are going through such crisis now.  We have gone through the\r\n\r\nprevious  crisis  and we have overcome.  We  will  overcome  the\r\n\r\npresent crisis, provided we have the will and determination  and\r\n\r\nresolve as a united people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday DPM Lee announced the Government's measures. The\r\n\r\nGovernment has acted very swiftly in facing the\r\n\r\nproblem.  He has given solutions to the short-term problem,  but\r\n\r\nthe Committee has also recommended some long-term measures and I\r\n\r\nhope the Government will take the opportunity at the appropriate\r\n\r\ntime to debate them as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage cut has been accepted by the employees. In many\r\n\r\ncountries,  such  a  move  would have caused  political  crisis,\r\n\r\nperhaps  even crisis in the standing of the government,  but  we\r\n\r\nare  fortunate.   And it is to the credit of the  NTUC  and  its\r\n\r\nleadership  that  it has persuaded the workers  to  accept  some\r\n\r\ntemporary cut.  It is laudable that there is a stable industrial\r\n\r\nclimate in Singapore.  Labour, Government and employers all have\r\n\r\nworked in achieving this.  The NTUC has done a remarkable job in\r\n\r\ngetting the workers to accept less CPF and less pay.  Sir, I was\r\n\r\nmoved  when my fellow NMP, Mr Cyrille Tan, related the  question\r\n\r\nof  retrenchment.  He knows the problem because he  himself  has\r\n\r\nbeen a victim.  He painted a graphic picture.  Only a person who\r\n\r\nhas been retrenched can show this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst the workers are asked to make some sacrifice, I am\r\n\r\ndisappointed  to read in the Business Times that  the  corporate\r\n\r\nworld  is not showing the same trend.  Whilst the employees  are\r\n\r\nasked  to sacrifice, some of the captains of our corporate world\r\n\r\nare  taking more pay, when, in fact, their company's performance\r\n\r\nhas  declined.  I appeal to the corporate world to be  realistic\r\n\r\nand  not  to  be  marginalised by their action.   The  directors\r\n\r\ncannot  persuade  the  workers to  take  a  pay  cut  when  they\r\n\r\nthemselves  are not prepared to live by example.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nroom for double standards.  Similarly, those companies which are\r\n\r\ndoing well must reward their workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move to the financial sector. Our financial\r\n\r\nsector is in good health.  Our system is transparent.  Thanks to\r\n\r\nthe  MAS and its officials.  My complaint is that our banks  are\r\n\r\ntoo  over  cautious.  They are too conservative.  Permit  me  to\r\n\r\nelaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS does not believe in getting involved in the management\r\n\r\nof  credit and bank interest.  It may be so on paper.   However,\r\n\r\nit  can - I emphasise on the word \"can\" - persuade the banks  to\r\n\r\nbe  more market oriented.  When savings interest rates go  down,\r\n\r\nthe  banks  must try to lower their interest rates.   The  banks\r\n\r\nmust  not  be over anxious over loan portfolios.  They must  not\r\n\r\nstifle  enterprise.   There may be some companies  that  may  be\r\n\r\ngoing  through difficult times now but they have a potential  of\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  years to come.  They should give a helping  hand  to\r\n\r\nthem.  They should not recall loans.  They should do so only  as\r\n\r\na last resort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to the property sector, Sir. The last two years\r\n\r\nhave seen property prices decline, in some cases as much as  60%\r\n\r\nfrom the peak.  Nobody knows when we will reach the bottom.  Had\r\n\r\nthe Government not intervened in 1996, we would have a sad story\r\n\r\ntoday.   Nevertheless, I urge the Government not  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nproperty market to collapse.  It will not be good either for the\r\n\r\nproperty  market  or  for the banks or the  country.   What  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should do is to take away some of the restrictions it\r\n\r\nhad  imposed  earlier.  I ask the Government to  reconsider  its\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving to manpower, Sir, manpower is our main asset. One\r\n\r\narea  which we should look at is our birth rate.  Those who  can\r\n\r\nafford  should be encouraged to have more children.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nforever depend on guest workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to get talent, we should start young. We\r\n\r\nshould  encourage  the bright students from other  countries  to\r\n\r\ncome and study here.  They will stimulate our students.  Some of\r\n\r\nthem  may  want to stay back and even those who return to  their\r\n\r\ncountries  would be our life-long unpaid ambassadors.   In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  companies could offer scholarship.   SIA  has  such  a\r\n\r\nscholarship scheme.  I urge other Government-linked companies to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage more international schools to be set up\r\n\r\nhere.  We have the potential of becoming the educational hub  of\r\n\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the Government's concern in attracting foreign\r\n\r\ntalents.   Let  me  take  the example  of  the  print  media  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  Straits  Times  has  a  number  of  expatriate\r\n\r\njournalists.   They have helped to improve the  quality  of  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  Sunanda Datta Ray and Asad Latif are just two names.\r\n\r\nThey  are senior leader writers, very sensitive positions.   Yet\r\n\r\nwe  have them there.  Even the American and British print  media\r\n\r\nhave foreign talents.  The world is looking for talents.  If  we\r\n\r\ndo not attract them, other countries would do so.  We must never\r\n\r\nforget that we are by-products of an immigrant society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very encouraging to note in the Report that the\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  higher learning are being  asked  to  increase\r\n\r\ntheir  intake.  With the changing of our educational policy,  we\r\n\r\nwould become a learning nation.  Every individual should undergo\r\n\r\nsome  form  of training every year.  Our institutions of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning  are  offering extension courses.  We should  add  more\r\n\r\nsuch courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the world is changing fast. We are in the information\r\n\r\ntechnology  age.   It  is imperative that we  have  an  educated\r\n\r\nworkforce.  Employers must take the lead in job training.  It is\r\n\r\nnot  just  the responsibility of the Government and  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement.  The employers have a role to play.  This mindset must\r\n\r\nbe changed if we hope to become a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  must  also try to upgrade the skills  of  our  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  for  they form an important factor in  our  workforce.\r\n\r\nMany  of  these workers are educated but they may  have  a  poor\r\n\r\ncommand  of  English.   We  could offer  them  some  courses  in\r\n\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which we must review is our retirees and\r\n\r\nhousewives.   We  have not attracted them enough.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nlabour  market  must examine this because, as the Minister  said\r\n\r\nearlier, only 3% of our workforce are part-timers.  3% is a very\r\n\r\nsmall number and is indeed very low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move to tourism, Sir. It is a growing industry.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are also attracting talents, we have an edge over  the\r\n\r\nother Asian countries.  In short, we can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexport  some  of  our  talents.  Take  hotels.   In  some  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries,  we still find European and American hotel  managers.\r\n\r\nCan  we  build  up  our talents here so that they  could  manage\r\n\r\nhotels in other countries?  Better still, build or buy hotels in\r\n\r\nthese  countries, as some companies are already doing now.   The\r\n\r\ntrend has already started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, I have spoken and I will speak again on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of tourism.  There is a growing class of tourists  who\r\n\r\nare  interested in Asian culture.  Music and art  attract  them.\r\n\r\nOur  population   mix is to our advantage.  We should  encourage\r\n\r\nmusicals,  operas and ballets.  Similarly, we  should  hold  art\r\n\r\nexhibitions  and musical performances.  I would suggest  that  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  be  set  up,  as  we have  a  niche  over  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   Sir,  I  was pleased to read this  morning  in  the\r\n\r\nInternational  Herald  Tribune  that  our  cultural  scene   has\r\n\r\nactually attracted their attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area and many Members have spoken on this,\r\n\r\nie,  how  to  stimulate  our retail  sector.   While  I  am  not\r\n\r\nadvocating that we should give spending coupons proposed by  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  government, I think there is not enough  money  to  be\r\n\r\nspent  in the retail sector.  People do not have the money,  and\r\n\r\neven  those who have the money, they are trying to save for  the\r\n\r\nrainy  day.   We  must  try to give some help  to  this  sector,\r\n\r\nbecause it forms an important sector of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must not forget our political stability. I agree\r\n\r\nwith my colleague, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan, that Singapore is fortunate\r\n\r\nin  having  a good government.  We must evolve our own political\r\n\r\nsystem  where the citizens can participate not only in  decision\r\n\r\nmaking  but take some of the burden of the Government.  We  must\r\n\r\nstrengthen our civil society which is not only prepared to speak\r\n\r\nbut also do its best for the society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is so much to talk and so many Members are going to\r\n\r\nspeak.  I end my speech with this plea.  Fellow Singaporeans, we\r\n\r\nare fortunate that we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare not as badly hit as the other countries.  Let us put all our\r\n\r\nresolve, put the past behind us and try to build a bright future\r\n\r\nfor  our children.  We can do it and we will do it.  We have the\r\n\r\nresources.   We  have  the money and  the  means.   Let  us  all\r\n\r\ncontribute  our  effort to achieve the  goals  set  out  in  the\r\n\r\nReport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion has asked the House to endorse the strategies\r\n\r\nand  policies  set out in the Report.  I think  the  Government,\r\n\r\nMembers,  Opposition Members and NMPs must show to  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand the world at large that we are a united and one people.  May\r\n\r\nI  ask  the  entire House to give a resounding support  to  this\r\n\r\nmotion?  It should have a 100% approval from this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, DPM BG Lee Hsien Loong gave the Government's\r\n\r\nresponse   to  the  CSC's  recommendations.   Once  again,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  shown  that it is a  responsible  and  credible\r\n\r\nGovernment.    It  is  prepared  to  take  hard  and   difficult\r\n\r\ndecisions.   These decisions could not be easily taken  in  many\r\n\r\nother  countries.  In times of need, the Government is providing\r\n\r\nthe  right political leadership to rally and mobilise the people\r\n\r\nto  the  common cause.  In the short term, we want our companies\r\n\r\nto survive and to save jobs for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition has taken cheap pot shots at the Government\r\n\r\nfor  failing to foresee the danger signals and taking the  early\r\n\r\npre-emptive steps that could have avoided the sharp  decline  in\r\n\r\nthe  economy.  The Opposition should understand that  confidence\r\n\r\nis an infectious thing.  The most difficult thing about managing\r\n\r\nthe  economy is the psychology of people.  Every step  taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government is closely watched and interpreted by  investors\r\n\r\nand traders, both locally and overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only in the economy that is of interest to the\r\n\r\ninvestors  and traders.  It is politics that has contributed  to\r\n\r\nthe worsening regional business and trading environment.  For  a\r\n\r\nperiod in the early\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndays  of  the  regional economic crisis, the  foreign  financial\r\n\r\nanalysts and fund managers did not make any distinction  between\r\n\r\nthe situation in Singapore and the rest of the region.  With our\r\n\r\npolitical   leaders  taking  the  lead  to  explain  Singapore's\r\n\r\npolicies  and  strategies,  foreign investors  and  traders  now\r\n\r\nunderstand that Singapore is different and Singapore got what it\r\n\r\ntakes to continue to do well despite the political uncertainties\r\n\r\nin our neighbouring countries.  In fact, we are taking advantage\r\n\r\nof  the adversity of the regional economic crisis and turning it\r\n\r\ninto  a window of opportunity for Singapore to widen the gap  in\r\n\r\ncomparative advantage against our competitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the new era of information technology,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications and the globalisation of the economy, we have\r\n\r\nto   contend  with  the  highly  volatile  international  market\r\n\r\nenvironment.   We have therefore to be quick and nimble  in  our\r\n\r\nresponse to new changes and developments affecting us.  We  have\r\n\r\nto  be  agile and flexible to operate successfully in  this  new\r\n\r\nenvironment and this requires a change in mindset.  All the more\r\n\r\nwe  need a consensus in the vision for Singapore in the next  10\r\n\r\nyears.    The   Report   of   the   Committee   on   Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness  does just that.  The target  set  provides  the\r\n\r\ndirection  in  which we can all work together towards  a  common\r\n\r\ngoal.   The aim is to continually improve the standard of living\r\n\r\nof all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last two days, I heard Mr Low Thia Khiang repeatedly\r\n\r\nsaying  that  it  is  not necessary at this  stage  to  cut  the\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF  contribution, as he  thinks  the  economy  will\r\n\r\nrecover very soon and we need not take the bitter medicine.   He\r\n\r\nseems  to  suggest that the retrenchments taking place are  part\r\n\r\nand  parcel of working life.  Too bad, you are affected.   After\r\n\r\nall,  only  a  small percentage is affected by retrenchment  and\r\n\r\nunemployment.   Why  bring in the rest to suffer  together  with\r\n\r\nthis minority?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, there are more than 1.8 million working persons in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  From the selfish point of view, it could be\r\n\r\nargued that 90% of the workforce would have no problem retaining\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMany could not see the threat of retrenchment  or\r\n\r\nunemployment  affecting them.  Possibly, those  working  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  may  feel this way.  We all  know  that  nothing\r\n\r\nremains  static.   There  is always a danger  of  the  contagion\r\n\r\neffect.   Even in good companies, people can be affected through\r\n\r\ntakeovers,  mergers  and acquisitions.  In  good  times,  it  is\r\n\r\neasier  to  secure alternative employment.  In  difficult  times\r\n\r\nlike  this, those retrenched and new graduates may have  to  sit\r\n\r\nout for many months before they can find alternative employment.\r\n\r\nThis is our major concern - to save jobs and to create many more\r\n\r\nnew  jobs  for our people.  What the Government has done  is  to\r\n\r\npromote  shared  values and shared interests.   It  is  also  of\r\n\r\neducational value to let every Singaporean know that we  are  in\r\n\r\nit  together.  Perhaps the Opposition Members may not  be  aware\r\n\r\nthat they are promoting selfish attitudes among Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ncare about their individual selves.  Perhaps there are those who\r\n\r\nbelieve, like the Opposition Members, that we can take the  more\r\n\r\nlaissez-faire approach and things will improve naturally towards\r\n\r\nrecovery.   I  would  rather  that  we  be  safe,  prudent   and\r\n\r\nconservative  in  our approach in handling this tricky  economic\r\n\r\nsituation  in  hand.   Even  with  these  measures,  we   cannot\r\n\r\nguarantee  that  we will recover quickly.   So  we  do  what  is\r\n\r\nnecessary and hope for the best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to commend the action taken by the Government to\r\n\r\nhelp  bring  our economy on an even keel.  I am happy  that  the\r\n\r\ndaily-rated  employees and Divisions III and  IV  public  sector\r\n\r\nemployees do not suffer the direct cuts in their monthly salary.\r\n\r\nThe Government, as an employer, is taking good care of the lower\r\n\r\nsalaried staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, the public sector employees may\r\n\r\nfeel  the  most  secure  during this period,  because  they  are\r\n\r\ninsulated from the experience of those directly affected by  the\r\n\r\ndownturn in business.  Civil servants are always occupied.  What\r\n\r\nmore with work being generated for them with Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npump-priming  and  revisions  to Government  taxes,  levies  and\r\n\r\ncharges.   The Government, by its action in cutting the salaries\r\n\r\nof  civil servants in Division III and above, is bringing  civil\r\n\r\nservants  closer  to  the reality on what is  happening  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is a cap in the employer's CPF contribution at the\r\n\r\nmonthly  salary  of  $6,000, it is only fair and equitable  that\r\n\r\nthose in the higher income category above $6,000 be made to take\r\n\r\na  direct  pay  cut.   I  am happy to note that  the  Ministers,\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament and senior civil servants will have  their\r\n\r\nannual  remuneration  reduced  by  up  to  10%.   This  is  what\r\n\r\nleadership  by example is all about, and the rest of the  people\r\n\r\nshould be pleased that the right tone is set for them to follow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an interesting feature in the package announced by DPM\r\n\r\nLee yesterday is the effort to help our domestic retail trade by\r\n\r\nplugging  the leak in our economy, by reducing the exempt  limit\r\n\r\nof  GST to travellers.  I believe Singaporeans will support  the\r\n\r\nmove.  I am sure the retail sector will welcome this gesture  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  I am also sure that the businesses are pleased\r\n\r\nwith  the  reduction  in  the foreign worker  levy.   The  total\r\n\r\nsavings  of  $204  million  will  be  an  added  fillip  to  the\r\n\r\ncompanies, especially the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF has undergone many modifications. We are\r\n\r\nintroducing many uses for CPF.  I am concerned whether,  in  the\r\n\r\nlong  term,  CPF  account holders will have enough  to  live  on\r\n\r\nduring  their  years  in retirement.  Will  the  investments  in\r\n\r\nproperty  and shares allow them to realise good values  in  time\r\n\r\nfor their retirement?  I would suggest that the Government do  a\r\n\r\nthorough   review  of  the  CPF  scheme  so  that  we   do   not\r\n\r\nunconsciously  lead to the unintended effects arising  from  the\r\n\r\nmany uses of CPF accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of human intellectual capital, Mr J. B.\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam yesterday criticised the Government for not reviewing\r\n\r\nthe  educational system.  I am surprised with his  remarks.   He\r\n\r\nmust have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen  deaf  to the outcry of parents and teachers that  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  making too frequent changes to our educational system.   I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that  he  supports the need to constantly  review  our\r\n\r\neducational  curricula  to  keep  up  with  the  times.   It  is\r\n\r\nprecisely   what   the  Education  Ministry  has   been   doing,\r\n\r\nintroducing  critical  thinking skills, information  technology,\r\n\r\nnational  education and even community service into  the  school\r\n\r\ncurricula. The GPC for Education has always been supporting  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's efforts to bridge the skill and qualification  gap,\r\n\r\nto  ensure that graduates and school leavers have the capability\r\n\r\nand   competency  to  fit  easily  and  quickly  into  the  work\r\n\r\nrequirements.   Our  students are already perceptibly  different\r\n\r\ntoday from yesteryears.  They are more confident, articulate and\r\n\r\nhave inquiring minds.  They are our hopes for the future.  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  that  young Singaporeans can benefit  from  the  wide\r\n\r\nrange of educational courses in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NTUC leaders and the labour movement are to be\r\n\r\napplauded  for their hard work to arrive at this consensus.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  it is because of their hard work that they have made  our\r\n\r\njobs so much easier today.  After this debate, Sir, this is  the\r\n\r\ntime  to act.  I am optimistic that our economy will recover  in\r\n\r\nthe not distant future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand\r\n\r\nto  applaud  the CSC for a job well done and the Government  for\r\n\r\nits  response  to  the  CSC's recommendations.   I  believe  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  decisive and comprehensive package,  announced  by\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee  yesterday, will bring us out of this  economic  crisis\r\n\r\nsooner  and will place us in a better position to handle  future\r\n\r\nchallenges.   I  would like to mention, in  particular,  that  I\r\n\r\nwelcome the Government's initiative to cut the salaries  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters by 10%, in spite of the two consecutive years of  wage\r\n\r\nfreeze.  It is good that our Government has again shown  us  its\r\n\r\nreadiness to lead by example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree with the Government's decision to cut\r\n\r\nthe employer's CPF contribution by 10%, I am concerned about the\r\n\r\ncut of 4% from the Special Account.  This\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill mean many account holders will find it harder to attain the\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum.  I would like to reiterate that the Minimum Sum  in\r\n\r\nthe   Special  Account  is  extremely  important  because   life\r\n\r\nexpectancy of Singaporeans is increasing towards 80 years of age\r\n\r\nand many will require their Minimum Sum for subsistence in times\r\n\r\nsoon  to  come.   I  strongly  suggest  that  the  shortfall  in\r\n\r\ncontribution here be promptly reinstated at the end of these two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Government's package of aid to\r\n\r\nalleviate  the burden of lower income families.  However,  I  am\r\n\r\ndisappointed  that  there is no mention  of  any  help  for  the\r\n\r\nretrenched.   Sir, I would like to entreat this  House  to  also\r\n\r\nconsider  the  more immediate and adverse side  effects  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn which has left many people unemployed.   Just\r\n\r\nlast  September, 62,000 workers in Singapore were without  jobs.\r\n\r\nSir,  62,000  may  be  just a number, mere  statistics  to  some\r\n\r\npeople.   But not to us, because this means that the bad effects\r\n\r\nof  retrenchment are affecting too many of our people.  And  the\r\n\r\nlives  of these Singaporeans and their family members can indeed\r\n\r\nbe badly affected, not only in financial terms but also in terms\r\n\r\nof  psychological  and social well-being.   The  conviction  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  to  achieve  that Singapore dream  gets  questioned.\r\n\r\nThese  people  can  be  left totally demoralised.   Indeed,  the\r\n\r\ndistress  from retrenchment can be very heart-breaking  and  the\r\n\r\nhardship from income loss can be very harsh.  Although this  may\r\n\r\nbe   especially  so  for  sole  breadwinners  of  families  with\r\n\r\nchildren,  the  hardship will be felt  by  all  members  of  the\r\n\r\naffected families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no provision for unemployment benefit in\r\n\r\nSingapore and I am not an advocate for one. Welfarism  has  many\r\n\r\ndown-sides  and  will not work in Singapore.  However,  we  must\r\n\r\nhave   some   degree  of  humanitarian  and  social   conscience\r\n\r\nconsiderations  from the Government.  We have  built  up  strong\r\n\r\nreserves over the years for rainy days, I presume.  Are  we  not\r\n\r\nin  the  middle of the storm right now?  Although I  agree  with\r\n\r\nDPM's reservation yesterday about our changing from a nation  of\r\n\r\nsavers accumulating wealth to a nation of spenders depleting it,\r\n\r\nI would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike  to  see a helping hand extended to the families  of  those\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers  who are having genuine difficulties,  often\r\n\r\nthrough no fault of their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government could disperse a one-time funding through\r\n\r\nthe CDCs to tide over the retrenched who are in dire need during\r\n\r\nthe  two  difficult  years envisaged.  Not  all  the  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  will need the help because some have personal  savings,\r\n\r\nsome  are  from double-income families and the spouses  are  not\r\n\r\nunemployed.   Some would simply not want such aid and  certainly\r\n\r\nnot  for  the  full two years and so on.  Nonetheless,  even  if\r\n\r\nhypothetically,  every single one of the  62,000  retrenched  or\r\n\r\nunemployed workers were to apply for the two full years of  $500\r\n\r\nper  month subsistence help, the amount would be just under $750\r\n\r\nmillion.  This, indeed, would be a large sum of  money,  but  it\r\n\r\nwould  be well received humanitarian aid from the nation to  its\r\n\r\nvery own citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not ordinary times and what can be done should be\r\n\r\ndone.   I have met people who have been retrenched. They  looked\r\n\r\ntrapped   and  the  desperation  they  expressed  is  unbearably\r\n\r\nprofound.   Now,  there  will always be  argument  that  we  may\r\n\r\nencourage reliance and complacency as well as ending up  with  a\r\n\r\n\"dole  queue\".   Sir,  I  feel that  these  fears  will  not  be\r\n\r\nvalidated  because the applicants will need  to  apply  for  the\r\n\r\nmonthly aid and they will, of course, be subjected to satisfying\r\n\r\nthe  eligibility criteria set out to stem abuse and  dependence.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  $500  per month is barely enough for subsistence  and\r\n\r\nthe majority of people will want to earn more than that in order\r\n\r\nto have a better living for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is a 4 to 1 matching grant of up to $3\r\n\r\nmillion each year from the Government for the CDCs when money is\r\n\r\nraised  by the grassroots.  It is not easy to raise funds during\r\n\r\ntimes  like  these.   There is a varying capacity  by  different\r\n\r\nconstituencies  to raise funds.  The ones that  have  the  least\r\n\r\ncapability to raise funds may be the ones that need the most  to\r\n\r\nsupport  families in financial difficulties. \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMoreover,  most  of\r\n\r\nthe money raised for the CDCs in many constituencies have\r\n\r\nbeen  committed to other charitable projects.  In this  context,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  I  plead  with  the  Government  for  this  one-time\r\n\r\noutright funding through the CDCs to help the retrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no mention in the Government's response about\r\n\r\nthe  need  to look into the employability difficulties faced  by\r\n\r\nthe  older workers in the country.  I share the same concern  as\r\n\r\nmentioned by my parliamentary colleague, Dr Vasoo, in this area.\r\n\r\nI  believe that skills upgrading of workers is the correct  path\r\n\r\nforward.  I also believe that higher technology industries  will\r\n\r\nposition us better economically in the future.  However,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us to also consider the social implications  for\r\n\r\nthe  society as a whole when we try to achieve our  ideals.   We\r\n\r\nrun  the risk of leaving many of our people completely redundant\r\n\r\nand  causing more social ills than necessary.  There  are  about\r\n\r\n500,000 lower-skilled workers at the moment and many of them are\r\n\r\nabove  40 years of age.  Mr Speaker, Sir, how many and how  fast\r\n\r\ncan  these people be upgraded in their skills?  Retraining takes\r\n\r\ntime  and not everyone can be upgraded in skills for a multitude\r\n\r\nof  reasons.   The  lack of motivation may be  a  reason.   But,\r\n\r\nfinancial  considerations,  the  lack  of  opportunity  and  the\r\n\r\ninability   to  master  new  skills  are  even  more   important\r\n\r\nlimitations.   Of course, we cannot accept such  excuses  if  we\r\n\r\nwant a more productive workforce.  Nevertheless, while trying to\r\n\r\nachieve our goal, the livelihood and well-being of these  people\r\n\r\nhave  to be considered.  Along the way, we should leave a  niche\r\n\r\nsection of the economic pie for them.  In this respect,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould like this House to consider the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Lower technology jobs should not be phased out\r\n\r\ncompletely.  They have to be supported and even encouraged until\r\n\r\nsuch  time  when we have trained our unskilled and  semi-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Employers must be encouraged to hire more older\r\n\r\nworkers.  Perhaps we need a helping hand from the Government by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nway  of  incentives  such as (a) linking the  quota  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  employed  with the number of older Singaporean  workers\r\n\r\nemployed  or  (b)  special tax incentives  for  companies  which\r\n\r\nemploy older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On the part of employers again, job vacancies must be\r\n\r\nmade available or even created for our local workers.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  doubt that Singaporeans shun certain kinds of jobs and  tend\r\n\r\nto  let  foreigners  fill them.  This should be  addressed,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  by  the  use of more prefabricated materials  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry  or  by the  use  of  automation  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industry, and so on.  Steps taken to  change  the\r\n\r\nmindset of employers towards such ideas ought to be addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Emphasis on changing the mindset of our local workers\r\n\r\nshould  also be enhanced.  We need to encourage more of our  own\r\n\r\nworkers  to  take  up  jobs that have been  designated  as  \"for\r\n\r\nforeigners  only\"  or  jobs  that  are  considered   lowly   and\r\n\r\ndemeaning.   Being choosy and unwilling to take  on  jobs  below\r\n\r\ntheir expectations in terms of salary or status is probably  the\r\n\r\nmost  significant mindset change required.  Such mindset  change\r\n\r\nwill  have  to come in due course because more workers  will  be\r\n\r\ncompeting for limited preferred jobs in the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The Skills Redevelopment Programme's efforts towards\r\n\r\nhelping  companies upgrade the skills of their workers  is  most\r\n\r\nlaudable.   This  programme  must  be  encouraged  and  promoted\r\n\r\nresolutely to encompass more sectors of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our efforts to equip ourselves for this economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  I would also like to beseech this Government  not  to\r\n\r\nignore  the  plight of our womenfolk.  I would like  to  commend\r\n\r\nthese two points for attention:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, women comprise 40% of our workforce and many of\r\n\r\nthem  bear the burden of having the multi-role of looking  after\r\n\r\nthe  home,  bringing up children and caring  for  their  elderly\r\n\r\nparents.  Many need maids as a result of these responsibilities.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to help them.  Although the Government is not lowering\r\n\r\nthe levy for foreign domestic helpers at this juncture,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  would hope for a review later.  A lower levy will go  a  long\r\n\r\nway  when  family  incomes  are  to  be  significantly  reduced.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, not many working women earn enough to benefit  from\r\n\r\nthe double tax deduction.  In fact, there were only 17,425 women\r\n\r\nwho  were  eligible last year, or about only 15%  of  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber of employers of foreign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, childcare centres and before-and-after-school\r\n\r\ncare centres have certainly been a boon for more mothers to seek\r\n\r\njobs  and  contribute to the economy.  The importance  of  these\r\n\r\ncentres is recognised by the Government.  More of them have been\r\n\r\nset  up  and  subsidies for working mothers  have  been  rightly\r\n\r\ngiven.   I would like to see attention given here by having  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies  increased in view of the impending CPF and pay  cuts.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  I applaud the CSC's recommendation  to  have\r\n\r\n\"neighbour  care\"  by  extending child  care  subsidies  to  all\r\n\r\nworking  mothers, instead of restricting them to those who  send\r\n\r\ntheir  children to formal childcare centres.  This would  create\r\n\r\nmore  jobs  for  the  homebound women  to  mind  someone  else's\r\n\r\nchildren in their homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we need to work together as a nation,\r\n\r\nwith a single-minded wish to see us out of these bad times.   We\r\n\r\nwill  experience hardship and we will remember the  saying,  \"no\r\n\r\npain, no gain\".  However, I would like the Government to let the\r\n\r\ndegree of hardship become a factor in all our endeavours and  to\r\n\r\nremember what I would add, \"too much pain is no gain too\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,    so   much   has   been   discussed   about   Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   The cost-cutting packages announced  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  by  DPM  Lee  was a \"sunshine\" package.   However,  these\r\n\r\ndiscussions  on long-term economic policies and short-term  cuts\r\n\r\nin  business  costs, which will take time to be implemented  and\r\n\r\nfelt, are not all understood by the man-in-the-street nor  by  a\r\n\r\nlarge segment of Singaporeans not trained in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  terms.  Their immediate concerns are still the  threat\r\n\r\nof unemployment and the impact of wage and CPF cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations evidently will enhance business\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  but they are pressing ordinary Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nshoulder  the  urgent  responsibility of making  Singapore  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive, by accepting a wage cut and lowering of safety  net\r\n\r\ncontributions  from employer's CPF contribution.   This  is  the\r\n\r\nreality of global competition when we have to cut wages to  stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive, because they form the most significant component in\r\n\r\nour operating costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, accepting \"tough times\" and a harsh business reality,\r\n\r\nhowever, does not wish away the assault of deprivations and  the\r\n\r\npains in people's struggles to make ends meet.  Many MPs had, in\r\n\r\nthe  last  few days, called for a compassionate gesture  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to try its utmost to alleviate the financial pains of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  so  that, as Dr Michael Lim said,  \"their  spirits\r\n\r\nwill not be broken\", and I echo their calls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more can we all do for the vulnerable in this crisis?\r\n\r\nI  do  not  agree  to using the reserves or,  as  DPM  Lee  said\r\n\r\nyesterday, lao ben [         ].  And he had translated  that  to\r\n\r\nguan  cai ben [                        ].  That is a little  bit\r\n\r\nfatalistic,  and it is like the end of a journey, because  there\r\n\r\nis  no  life  in  coffins.   I  would  call  it  a  \"reserve  in\r\n\r\nperpetuity\"  -  there to guarantee generations of  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nour  children and grandchildren the security of having something\r\n\r\nthere  for  them,  as a last resort.  Take my  own  family,  for\r\n\r\nexample.  We set up a trust for our children so that if anything\r\n\r\nhappens  to  us or our fortunes, they have the reserve  to  fall\r\n\r\nback  on.   We explained to them that they have to grow  it  for\r\n\r\ntheir  children and grandchildren, in perpetuity.  And if  there\r\n\r\nis  a  critical  need, it can only be for  education  need.   We\r\n\r\nbelieve,  if  everything else fails, an education  guarantees  a\r\n\r\njob,  and  life.   Therefore, I agree, bu yao  dong  lao  ben  [\r\n\r\n],  bu yao da puo man [                                  ].   Do\r\n\r\nnot  touch the reserves.  It is a psychology of security for the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what can we do? I will highlight five focus areas which\r\n\r\nhave direct impact which we can still work on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is more of the many commendable programmes\r\n\r\nalready  started  by MOM and NTUC in areas  of  job  search  and\r\n\r\nplacement  and skills training for workers.  I am glad  to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom   the   Minister  this  afternoon  about   the   employment\r\n\r\nfacilitating channels and the retrenchment advisory unit.  Those\r\n\r\nare   positive   initiatives.   But  I  would   call   for   the\r\n\r\nstrengthening   of   three  strategies.   The   first   is   the\r\n\r\nstrengthening  of job matching channels for older  persons.   We\r\n\r\nknow  how hard it is for the 35 to 40-year olds to get employed,\r\n\r\nbecause  employers and marketplace prefer younger  workers  with\r\n\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.10 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM has said that if employers are found to have terminated\r\n\r\nthe  services  of a worker unfairly on account of old  age,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  order his reinstatement to his previous  job,  or\r\n\r\nrequire  the  employer  to offer monetary  compensation  to  the\r\n\r\naffected worker.  Sir, that is very reassuring.  We have read in\r\n\r\nthe  papers  how hard it is for the 40-year olds to  find  jobs.\r\n\r\nThe most recent one reported was Mr Shaik Alauddin who could not\r\n\r\nfind a job for 11 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the reasons given in that article were valid - skills\r\n\r\nlevel,  unmatchable  capabilities, low work  adaptability,  etc.\r\n\r\nBut we have to look closely at our million over 40-year olds and\r\n\r\ndo  a  skills audit.  In view of the current employers' attitude\r\n\r\nand  market demand for fewer workers, who are cheaper but higher\r\n\r\nqualified  ones,  it  may mean more \"older  persons\"  will  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  finding jobs.  (And that represents probably  three-quarters  of the Members of the House here in the `50s  who  may\r\n\r\nbecome  potential job seekers!).  We may need  to  identify  the\r\n\r\nkind of industry clusters which we can match and train them for.\r\n\r\nThis category of people still have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n20  more good years to contribute to society; it is our economic\r\n\r\nloss not to employ them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that DPM's response yesterday registered the\r\n\r\nsame  concern.   May  I  then ask if  we  can  consider  special\r\n\r\nincentive schemes for employers who employ older persons?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second strategy is to identify more part-time work for\r\n\r\nworking  mothers.   The  Government  has  removed  some  of  the\r\n\r\ndisincentives for part-time work in public service  by  allowing\r\n\r\npart-time workers to claim the same CPF contributions and  leave\r\n\r\nschemes  as  full-time workers on a pro-rata  basis.   Dr  Aline\r\n\r\nWong,  in  a  recent  statement, reported  that  private  sector\r\n\r\ncompanies,  however, have not been flexible in making  part-time\r\n\r\nand flexi-time work more readily available to their workers.   I\r\n\r\nsupport  Dr Aline Wong's call for employer groups to  study  how\r\n\r\npart-time  schemes  are  practised in  some  countries  such  as\r\n\r\nBritain and Sweden, and learn from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we think of setting up a dedicated database to identify the\r\n\r\nkind  of part-time work in demand in the marketplace, so that  a\r\n\r\npart-time  job clearing house can be set up and a mechanism  for\r\n\r\njob  identification,  recruitment and  placement  can  start  to\r\n\r\noperate?  The 900 queries for part-time jobs which Minister  Lee\r\n\r\nBoon  Yang  reported two days ago provide a baseline for  us  to\r\n\r\nidentify  what  workers are looking for  and  what  special  job\r\n\r\ndesigns can be customised to absorb them.  This is a good  start\r\n\r\nto systematically examine part-time job clusters for the Back-to-Work programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third strategy is more of the excellent initiatives like SRP\r\n\r\nand  CREST  which are targeted at 800,000 workers for  the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years,  but  to  be extended to other  beneficiaries  like\r\n\r\nhousewives,  older persons, schools, voluntary groups,  etc,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we truly can become a learning people and thinking  nation\r\n\r\nat all levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make a call to all employers in the private\r\n\r\nsector  at  this  juncture  to  reinforce  the  efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   by  creatively  aligning  their  work  and   people\r\n\r\nresources in such a way\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  workers, old and young, men and women, can  still  have  a\r\n\r\njob, even if need be, on a part-time basis.  For example, we can\r\n\r\nadopt a policy of wage cut by reducing two or four work days  in\r\n\r\na month for each staff.  Administered on a rotational basis, the\r\n\r\ncompany carries on business as usual with fewer staff having  to\r\n\r\ndouble  up  and perform cross-functionally.  Freed  from  office\r\n\r\ntime,  many  staff can now attend to family matters and  go  for\r\n\r\nsome  inexpensive training courses.  Life will be more balanced,\r\n\r\nalthough  in  some  cases, the salary  cut  can  be  inadequate.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is better that everyone in the company has a  little\r\n\r\nless, than a few to lose their jobs completely.  And I also urge\r\n\r\nemployers  to  pay back to workers, in the form of  bonuses,  in\r\n\r\nDecember 1999 if their companies did well next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second focus is more community-based initiatives like what\r\n\r\nCDCs  and  voluntary agencies have developed.  I will  highlight\r\n\r\ntwo strategies.  The first is reaching out to the poor.  Here, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  applaud grassroots leaders  and  volunteers  in\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar and Marine Parade and recently Ang  Mo  Kio/Cheng\r\n\r\nSan  CDCs  for their mission to brief the poor in one- and  two-room  flats on help schemes available to them.  I observed  that\r\n\r\neven  among  the  social  service  agencies,  the  knowledge  of\r\n\r\navailable  resources  for coping with  the  economic  crisis  is\r\n\r\nfragmented and poorly understood.  The next obstacle for a needy\r\n\r\nperson,  after  she  or  he knows where  to  get  help,  is  the\r\n\r\noverwhelming procedures involved in getting the help, especially\r\n\r\nfor  older persons and those who feel threatened by an  English-speaking institution and are illiterate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that the myriad schemes offered by\r\n\r\nGovernment,  including CDCs, CCCs, Women's Executive  Committees\r\n\r\nand  all  the Family Service Centres and other civic bodies  are\r\n\r\nnot  sufficiently  publicised  and  disseminated  to  the  needy\r\n\r\nfamilies.   This is the reason why I applaud the  volunteers  in\r\n\r\nthe CDCs for taking the pain to go to the needy homes, listen to\r\n\r\ntheir problems, help to fill up the forms by detailing the  sort\r\n\r\nof problems to be tackled and then fax over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  CDC  staff for them to follow up their support  function  by\r\n\r\ncontacting the relevant authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This painstaking exercise, for me, is \"grassroots\r\n\r\ndemocracy\" at its best.  I hope this effort will repeat in every\r\n\r\nconstituency.    By  mobilising  all  these  volunteer   groups,\r\n\r\nresidents  in  the community and CDC staff, we are  revitalising\r\n\r\nthe \"gotong royong\" spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second strategy is to bring the bureaucracy to the man-in-the-street like what the CDCs did by setting up an employment\r\n\r\nhotline,  employment  information and  exhibitions  in  shopping\r\n\r\nmalls  and  working closely with MOM to help residents  fill  up\r\n\r\nemployment  forms.   I  hope more of these will  continue  which\r\n\r\nwould   clearly  break  up  the  tyranny  of  the  \"bureaucratic\r\n\r\nleadership\"  which  Mr  Chiam  See  Tong  cautioned  us  against\r\n\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third focus is more of what the Government can do in the\r\n\r\narea  of  rents, fees, taxes on utilities and assistance schemes\r\n\r\nto  help  the  cashflow situation of ordinary folks.   The  cost\r\n\r\nreduction package announced yesterday had gone beyond  what  the\r\n\r\nCSC  has recommended, for which we should be thankful.  However,\r\n\r\nSir,  another  5,000  more people will  be  losing  their  jobs,\r\n\r\nbringing our total unemployed to 25,000, according to recent MOM\r\n\r\nestimates.   More  and more bankruptcies were  recorded  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  eight  months of this year.  What shall these  households\r\n\r\ndo?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear that the Government will consider\r\n\r\nreleasing  CPF monies to family members to pool their  resources\r\n\r\ntogether  to  pay  for  their house mortgages.   The  presenting\r\n\r\nproblems,  however, of clients seeking help  in  Family  Service\r\n\r\nCentres in the past six months were essentially difficulties  in\r\n\r\nsecuring  employment, in meeting basic needs, children's  school\r\n\r\nrelated expenses and lifestyle adjustment.  The hardest hit  are\r\n\r\nsingle  parents from low income families whose situations worsen\r\n\r\nwhen the search for permanent employment gets harder because  of\r\n\r\nthe poor job market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the special assistance schemes set up by NTUC, MCD and\r\n\r\nMOM  will  respond  to  the critical needs of  these  vulnerable\r\n\r\ngroups  fast and generous enough.  I would like to know  if  any\r\n\r\nemergency fund has been set up for Ministries to have access  to\r\n\r\nwhen  they are called to respond to difficult cases and  whether\r\n\r\nthe criteria for application for these funds have been broadened\r\n\r\nin recent months to meet the needs of vulnerable families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee yesterday urged us to build our \"national\r\n\r\nresilience\" and \"social cohesion\" to stand together and maintain\r\n\r\na sense of common purpose.  Let us note that people under crisis\r\n\r\nand struggling to survive, burning candles at both ends, are too\r\n\r\nspiritually  and physically exhausted to be able  to  put  their\r\n\r\nmettle  to test.  It is the rest of us who are better  off,  who\r\n\r\nmust,  in  partnership, stretch our \"helping hands\" to  pick  up\r\n\r\nthose  who are falling and slipping - this is truly for  me  the\r\n\r\nethos  of  strengthening our shared experience of adversity  and\r\n\r\nstruggle.   In the scheme of things, whose helping hand  is  the\r\n\r\nfirmest  and  the most able to be generous - the Government,  of\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth focus is more of what NTUC Fairprice has done by\r\n\r\ncutting down the cost of living by price reductions.  It  was  a\r\n\r\ngenerous  move.  And as a direct beneficiary, I look forward  to\r\n\r\nmore  cuts  in even more items in January 1999.  I  applaud  the\r\n\r\nadoption of NTUC Income for helping insurance policy holders and\r\n\r\nborrowers pay their premiums and housing loans, and a whole  lot\r\n\r\nof  other measures to alleviate their financial pains.   To  me,\r\n\r\nNTUC sets the exemplary standards in proactively moderating  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  the  economic crisis on daily  costs  of  living  of\r\n\r\nordinary people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth focus is more stress on fast response time in all\r\n\r\nMinistries  by  providing efficient and shorter processing  time\r\n\r\nrequired  for  some  of the assistance schemes  offered  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Maybe our bureaucracies could consider  engaging  a\r\n\r\ncorps  of paid part-time residents or retrenched persons  to  do\r\n\r\nthe tiresome liaison work of attending to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\napplications, giving appropriate information, filling  up  forms\r\n\r\nand  completing the follow-up detail actions.  The devil  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  detail,  as  we  say.  An economic crisis  requires  crisis\r\n\r\nintervention  skills which are fast, efficient and effective  to\r\n\r\nensure  that those affected have the information and  access  to\r\n\r\ncritical services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I have been travelling around in the region\r\n\r\nin  the  last six months and most foreigners I met had  conveyed\r\n\r\nsuch excellent remarks about how Singaporeans and our Government\r\n\r\nhave tackled the economic crisis with remarkable discipline  and\r\n\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My deep disappointment with this Report is its lack of long-term strategic thinking on the value of the social fundamentals\r\n\r\nas  social  capital, which is crucial for human development  and\r\n\r\ncritical for honing a competitive society.  By social capital, I\r\n\r\nmean  the  network  of institutions and relationships  that  are\r\n\r\nimportant  for  the productive functioning of  a  society.   The\r\n\r\nnetwork  includes the families, community bodies, social service\r\n\r\nagencies,  civic bodies which are connected by shared ethos  and\r\n\r\ncollective memories of a place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intangible as they are in their contribution in terms of\r\n\r\ndollars  and  cents  to  business productivity,  social  capital\r\n\r\nprovides  the  sealant  in  community  bonding  and  the  social\r\n\r\nstability   upon   which   economic   competitiveness   thrives.\r\n\r\nResources  spent  on  people  services  help  to  moderate   the\r\n\r\nphenomenon of marginalisation and alienation among pockets of  a\r\n\r\npopulation  that  can  undermine social stability.   The  effort\r\n\r\nincludes  more financial and employment support to  groups  with\r\n\r\nspecial   needs,   for  example,  the  disabled   and   mentally\r\n\r\nchallenged;  and  more support across the  board  for  voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations which repair the broken pieces of people's lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government truly regards its role just as\r\n\r\nimportant  as businesses, and if the latter are going  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nlower  rentals in State-owned enterprises, can it not also grant\r\n\r\nfree  rent for one year, or perhaps considerable rent deductions\r\n\r\nto all VWOs operating on void decks?  I agree with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr  Koo  Tsai Kee that the 50-50 shared operating costs  between\r\n\r\nState  and  the  VWOs is a generous formula  and  in  the  total\r\n\r\noperating  costs,  rentals are not a major component.   However,\r\n\r\nevery  dollar  saved from rentals, averaging at about  $5,000  a\r\n\r\nyear is a whole lot of money for VWO, and what a relief it is to\r\n\r\nsave  some  money to run a service programme for the  community.\r\n\r\nNo   doubt,  we  can  raise  funds  by  organising  fund-raising\r\n\r\nactivities, but we all know how hard it is to raise  that  extra\r\n\r\ndollar.   I hope the Government will give this request a serious\r\n\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another noticeable omission in this Report was the neglect\r\n\r\nof   the  family  as  one  of  the  drivers  in  the  millennium\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, requiring a strategic blueprint in mapping  the\r\n\r\nsynergy  between the public and private sectors in their efforts\r\n\r\nof incorporating the agenda of family needs as part of workplace\r\n\r\nreorganisation.   The Report registered, in two paragraphs,  the\r\n\r\nvalue of pro-family work policies, such as flexi-wage and flexi-time  work  schedules.   There  are  many  more  family-friendly\r\n\r\npolicies to consider, such as childcare infrastructure, flexible\r\n\r\ncompensation structure, home-working opportunities, etc, that we\r\n\r\nneed to explore that will enhance productivity levels of men and\r\n\r\nwomen in general, without sacrificing the needs of the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a new mindset to organise people resources in both\r\n\r\nthe public and private sectors that is less discrete, more fuzzy\r\n\r\nand  blurred,  but  no  less  ineffective  and  inefficient,   a\r\n\r\nperspective  that  is  multi-disciplinary, multi-functional  and\r\n\r\ncross-boundary.  Economics, politics, sociology, history,  moral\r\n\r\nand  civic studies have to be cross-fertilised to guide the  way\r\n\r\nwe think and plan agendas for Singapore's competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, the competitive Singaporean for the millennium is\r\n\r\nsomeone who is clear in thinking, able to amass and process  the\r\n\r\ninformation  around him, fast on his or her feet to  respond  to\r\n\r\ncrisis  and adapt to change, quick and hands-on with his  hands,\r\n\r\nso that he or she is not just a talker but a doer, and feels the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompassion  for the needy and the vulnerable and for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich he or she calls \"Home\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires more than what this Report had blue-printed to\r\n\r\nproduce  the Millennium Singaporean that will be the competitive\r\n\r\nagent  to  bring  Singapore to the next higher level.   Engines,\r\n\r\nmachines  and  electronic  disc drives  are  only  part  of  the\r\n\r\ncompetition.   The  other  part, and  a  major  one,  is  people\r\n\r\nresource and their mindsets, values and spirit.  Perhaps the CSC\r\n\r\nis  not  the  forum  for  presenting these  laudable  ideas.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore    propose   that   the   Singapore   21   Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendations be used as Part Two addition to  the  Report  of\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  on  Singapore's Competitiveness,  bringing  into\r\n\r\nsharp  focus  the  significance  of  social  capital  underlying\r\n\r\neconomic  constructs  that  will  make  Singapore  a   city   of\r\n\r\nexcellence and a society of distinction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do support the motion standing in the name of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  there  is a Chinese saying,  \"Even  a  wise  man\r\n\r\nsometimes makes a mistake, while a fool may once in a while come\r\n\r\nout  with a good idea.\"  Having heard some 50 wise men and  wise\r\n\r\nladies  over  the  last three days, let me also  offer  my  non-\r\n\r\nwiseman idea on the subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee announced yesterday the cost-cutting package for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Overall, I feel that this is a pro-business package.\r\n\r\nOf  course, there are also some measures which may be said to be\r\n\r\npro-people.   But  I  must  say the vast  majority  of  measures\r\n\r\nintroduced are designed mainly for the benefit of the  business.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  magnitude  of  some items  of  the  cost-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures  may  even  exceed  the expectations  of  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity, for example, the foreign worker levy.  As far as  the\r\n\r\nbusiness community is concerned, it is good news.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, DPM Lee cautioned that this package, though designed\r\n\r\nto reduce business cost in Singapore to enhance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  competitiveness, was no assurance of  a quick  recovery  to\r\n\r\nthe economy because the determinants are external and beyond our\r\n\r\ncontrol.   But I have a question, if these external factors, ie,\r\n\r\nthe  regional economic situation continues to deteriorate,  then\r\n\r\nwhat  should we do?  We need to have  quicker measures to  react\r\n\r\nto the new reality.  In fact, this package to tackle the current\r\n\r\ncrisis  is  just  some short-term measures.   The  Committee  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's Competitiveness (CSC) was originally set up to  look\r\n\r\ninto how to strengthen the competitiveness of Singapore over the\r\n\r\nnext  ten  years.   It just so happened that a  currency  crisis\r\n\r\nbroke  out  very  soon  after the CSC was  formed,  and  it  was\r\n\r\nsuddenly landed with the responsibility of working out  some  ad\r\n\r\nhoc  measures to help our businesses in Singapore tide over  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we do have a designated mechanism, an official\r\n\r\nor  formal  mechanism, to deal with the sudden  emergence  of  a\r\n\r\ncrisis.   So,  with  the  experience gained  from  this  present\r\n\r\ncrisis,   perhaps we should seriously look into the  feasibility\r\n\r\nof  setting up a permanent mechanism, a think-tank sort of body,\r\n\r\nto deal with any crisis that may appear from time to time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is something which the Government should consider\r\n\r\nvery  seriously.   The current crisis has also  highlighted  one\r\n\r\nother point and, that is, our forecasts of the overall trends in\r\n\r\nthe  economy seem to be quite off the mark.  It appears that the\r\n\r\nauthorities   responsible  for  the  forecasts,  including   the\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies and the universities, have not been able  to\r\n\r\naccurately  forecast the trend of economic  development  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   It looks like accurate economic forecast is even  more\r\n\r\ndifficult than weather forecast.  Sir, before anybody can   come\r\n\r\nup  with  a more reliable mode of economic forecasting, I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the CSC should be kept alive as it  is  a  useful\r\n\r\nmechanism to have, particularly when its composition is  a  good\r\n\r\nmix  of  representatives from the business world.  Having  their\r\n\r\nfingers  on  the pulse of the business world, these  businessmen\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndetect   every   movement  in  the  rapidly  changing   business\r\n\r\nenvironment.   They are sensitive to changes  and  know  how  to\r\n\r\nrespond and react quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when faced with this serious\r\n\r\neconomic situation, the Ministers and senior civil servants have\r\n\r\ndecided to take the lead in taking a cut in their salaries. This\r\n\r\nis  a very great inspiration to the people, and it has very far-reaching effects.  This is a clear indication to our people that\r\n\r\nour leaders are sharing the pains with the people.  The proposed\r\n\r\npay-cuts  to  the  civil servants will save the Government  some\r\n\r\n$176 million.  Of course, this is a very significant amount.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  ensure that the sacrifices made by the Ministers  and\r\n\r\nsenior civil servants are made more significant, I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government make use of these savings to set up an emergency\r\n\r\nfund  to  help the lower-income families which are presently  in\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulties to tide over the current predicament.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that the Minister for Finance will agree to this  proposal\r\n\r\nof mine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way is to allocate sums of money from these savings to\r\n\r\nthe  various  Citizens' Consultative Committees  (CCCs)  welfare\r\n\r\nfunds  to carry out more welfare work because, with the  present\r\n\r\ndifficult  situation in our economy, the CCCs  are  finding   it\r\n\r\nvery  difficult to raise monies for their welfare funds.   So  I\r\n\r\nhope  that we can make use of the savings from the pay  cuts  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers and  top civil servants to the CCCs to help their\r\n\r\nconstituents.  By so doing, I hope and I believe  it  will  also\r\n\r\nhelp  to  strengthen  the  bond  between  the  people  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This will not only give tangible help to those  who\r\n\r\nare in need but also inspire our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the bread-and-butter issues. I hope that\r\n\r\nthe HDB would seriously consider lowering the selling prices  of\r\n\r\nnew  HDB  flats,  because over the past few years,  the  selling\r\n\r\nprices of HDB flats have gone up quite a lot.  Granted that  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  are still considerably cheaper than private developments,\r\n\r\nwe cannot fail to take cognizance of the fact that the prices of\r\n\r\nprivate  properties  have  already fallen  substantially.   This\r\n\r\nwill,  in  turn,  affect  the prices  of  HDB  flats.   Besides,\r\n\r\nbuilding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmaterials  and  construction cost have also fallen considerably.\r\n\r\nFor  example, I understand that the prices of cement,  which  is\r\n\r\none of the very important building materials, have gone down  by\r\n\r\nabout  30% in the past couple of years.  With such cost  savings\r\n\r\nfrom cheaper building materials and pay cuts of the workers,  it\r\n\r\nis  obvious  that the construction costs of HDB  flats  will  be\r\n\r\nlowered  and  HDB should pass on these savings  to  the  people,\r\n\r\nespecially the first-time buyers, the young couples.  Right now,\r\n\r\nthese  young people have to accept a lower starting pay,  or  to\r\n\r\nwait longer to get a job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is one other matter that we should concern\r\n\r\nourselves  with,  and  that is, with  the  announcement  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment package, how are we going to ensure that this package\r\n\r\nwill give real benefits to the end consumers.  For example,  the\r\n\r\nhawkers,  the  food courts, and so on, when are  they  going  to\r\n\r\nlower their prices so as to lighten the burden on the consumers?\r\n\r\nMr  Ang Mong Seng suggested holding a \"National Sales Campaign\".\r\n\r\nActually,  shopkeepers  and  hawkers  who  find  their  business\r\n\r\nthinning  away are already giving special offers  and  sales  in\r\n\r\ndesperate attempts to attract customers.  The question  is:  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  are doing a roaring business, how are  we  going  to\r\n\r\nconvince  them  to  lower their prices?   I  think  we  can  use\r\n\r\nadministrative measures and increase competition.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Trade  and Industry could  call  up  all  the\r\n\r\nbusiness   associations,   the   hawkers'   associations,    the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers' associations and remind them that they should  pass\r\n\r\non  at least in part, if not in full, some of their savings from\r\n\r\nthese  cost-cutting  measures, to the  consumers.   I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  encourage the NTUC to open up more coffeeshops  at\r\n\r\nsuitable locations so that there will be more competition in the\r\n\r\nretail  food  industry.  This will help to  lower  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the motion as proposed by the Minister for Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last 14 months, many Singaporeans have experienced\r\n\r\nthe effects of the regional financial crisis.  Some are affected\r\n\r\nfinancially  while  others  are affected  psychologically.   The\r\n\r\ncrisis  has  made all Singaporeans learnt one important  lesson,\r\n\r\nthat is:  `Do not take things for granted'.  Economies can fall,\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  relations can sour, property and  stock  prices  can\r\n\r\nfall, income can reduce, and our quality of life can drop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, many Singaporeans understand that they are much more\r\n\r\nfortunate  than many people in other countries.  This  fortunate\r\n\r\nsituation does not happen by chance.  It is the foresight of our\r\n\r\nGovernment and our prudent management of the economy  that  have\r\n\r\nsheltered Singaporeans from the vagaries of the regional crisis.\r\n\r\nThat is why the Government is now again rallying the support  of\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans to take tough measures to position  themselves\r\n\r\nin the global market in the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of crisis, all of us must make sacrifices and take a\r\n\r\nlonger  viewpoint  in  our  actions and  deeds.   In  this  way,\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be  able to cope with  the  crisis  and  emerge\r\n\r\nstronger as a more competitive economy in the global market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) has indeed\r\n\r\ndone a very comprehensive study to spearhead Singapore into  the\r\n\r\nnext  millennium.   Although many visions  and  strategies  were\r\n\r\nrecommended in the Report, it would be better if more details on\r\n\r\ntargets and method statements could be highlighted to guide  the\r\n\r\nrespective Ministries, statutory boards or companies to  achieve\r\n\r\nthe desired outcomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Government has accepted the cost-cutting\r\n\r\npackage  to  increase  Singapore's competitiveness.   But,  with\r\n\r\nfalling  demand  from  regional  economies,  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  take  aggressive  measures  to  strengthen   the\r\n\r\ncapabilities of our local firms and increase the market share of\r\n\r\ntheir products and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to offer some suggestions for the Government\r\n\r\nto consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Market Diversification</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small country with limited resources, Singapore has no\r\n\r\nchoice  but  to depend on foreign investors and other countries'\r\n\r\neconomies. Therefore, it is crucial for Singapore to  widen  its\r\n\r\nbusiness  dealings  with more countries so  as  to  cushion  the\r\n\r\neffects of fluctuating economies in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need to identify suitable products and services, which\r\n\r\nare  in  demand  in  these markets.  We need to  develop  market\r\n\r\nniches.   Potential  areas  include  consultancy  services   for\r\n\r\nhousing,  industrial park, health, R&D, and education  services.\r\n\r\nAs  for consumer products, we must form strategic alliances with\r\n\r\nMNCs  to  penetrate specific markets.  Singapore has  the  Asian\r\n\r\nculture and goodwill to become trustworthy partners of MNCs.   I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the Government to set up a task force to  focus  on\r\n\r\nstrategic alliances with MNCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be successful in market diversification, it is also essential\r\n\r\nfor  local firms to have strategic marketing.  Many local  firms\r\n\r\nare family businesses and may lack the exposure in international\r\n\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Trade and Development Board has been searching for\r\n\r\nmore  new  markets,  we need the expertise of private  marketing\r\n\r\nfirms, especially our own top marketing firms, to conduct market\r\n\r\nresearch  and  sell  our  products and  services.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can consider engaging the services of local marketing\r\n\r\nfirms by paying them a retainer fee.  These marketing firms  can\r\n\r\nthen  be  engaged  by  local firms, on a commission  basis,  for\r\n\r\nincreasing their sales overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building world class companies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the idea of nurturing our local companies to be\r\n\r\nworld-class  companies.  The CSC has proposed that  GLCs  should\r\n\r\nkick-start   the  process  as  they  have  the   resources   and\r\n\r\nexperience.   Although  the GLCs can  take  the  initiative,  we\r\n\r\nshould also, at the same time, support promising local firms  to\r\n\r\nbe   world-class  companies.   Doing  business  is   all   about\r\n\r\nnetworking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  business acumen.  To succeed in strengthening our  external\r\n\r\nwing, the Government must provide resources and take a stake  in\r\n\r\nboth  GLCs and private firms to strengthen their competitiveness\r\n\r\ninternationally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening Small and Medium Local Enterprises</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has surfaced some weaknesses in our\r\n\r\nSMEs, especially in financial planning and management.  In order\r\n\r\nto  play  a supporting or partnership role to MNCs and GLCs,  we\r\n\r\nmust  upgrade the management capabilities of our SMEs.  Although\r\n\r\nthere  are  many  Government schemes to assist  SMEs,  not  much\r\n\r\nguidance  has  been given to position our SMEs to  be  strategic\r\n\r\npartners of MNCs and GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to provide a scheme whereby\r\n\r\nSMEs   can  engage  professional  management  firms  to  conduct\r\n\r\nmanagement  audit to streamline their operations and  strengthen\r\n\r\ntheir  competitiveness.  These audits should focus  on  building\r\n\r\ncapabilities  instead  of merely cost  cutting  measures.   Such\r\n\r\naudits  must  also  be conducted regularly, maybe  on  a  3-year\r\n\r\nbasis,  to ensure that SMEs are kept viable and relevant to  our\r\n\r\neconomy.   We must also set criteria to measure the  success  of\r\n\r\nall  Government  assistance schemes in order to make  sure  that\r\n\r\nthey add value to our local firms and our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cost Cutting Measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cost cutting measures are inevitable, we should\r\n\r\nseriously  analyse the impact of these measures on Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  lower  income groups.  It  is  timely  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to reconvene the Cost Review Committee to  study  the\r\n\r\npublic's  concerns  regarding the rising  cost  of  living.   We\r\n\r\nshould also study the expected standard of living and quality of\r\n\r\nlife of Singaporeans in the next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey conducted by the Asiaweek of 40\r\n\r\ncities,  Singapore does not rank consistently high in  terms  of\r\n\r\nstandard of living and quality of life, especially in areas such\r\n\r\nas housing, hospital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeds  and cars.  We need to determine a balance between standard\r\n\r\nof living, cost of living and quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be the hub of Asia and attract foreign talent, Singapore\r\n\r\nmust benchmark its quality of life with comparable cities in the\r\n\r\nworld.  Unless this is achieved, it will be difficult to attract\r\n\r\ntop foreign talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the short term, I hope the Government can cushion\r\n\r\nthe  impact  of  the  cost cutting package  on  Singaporeans  by\r\n\r\nadopting the following measures:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Provide a one-off 15% personal income tax rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Provide a one-off subsidy for pupils in pre-school and\r\n\r\nkindergarten centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Reduce the car park fees for HDB and URA car parks by 15%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide more tax relief for Singaporeans who upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves through skills training including professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Encourage banks to allow HDB shops and hawker stalls to\r\n\r\nrestructure their loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Increase the S&C rebate to HDB residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Increase the National Servicemen's allowance to boost the\r\n\r\nmorale of SAF servicemen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Exercise more flexibility to allow parents to send their\r\n\r\nchildren to nearby schools so as to reduce their transport  cost\r\n\r\nburden.  This could be achieved by having more pupils per  class\r\n\r\nor building more classrooms in existing schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>5.50 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, like most of\r\n\r\nmy colleagues and as the last speaker on the list, I too support\r\n\r\nand agree with the motion standing in the name of the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Committee represents what is by far the most\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  study since the mid-80s to address the  immediate\r\n\r\nproblems and the long-term\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstrategies  to  keep Singapore on the right track  of  sustained\r\n\r\neconomic growth and development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, in this House, we heard the DPM giving the\r\n\r\nGovernment's response to the CSC recommendations.  The  response\r\n\r\nhas been most encouraging.  It shows that our Government takes a\r\n\r\nvery  serious view in dealing with our immediate problems.   The\r\n\r\nmeasures  that have been proposed so far are broad ranging.   It\r\n\r\nseeks to deal with our immediate problem of business cost in one\r\n\r\nfell  swoop rather than to deal with it in a piece-meal  manner.\r\n\r\nThese  cost  cutting measures no doubt will cheer  the  business\r\n\r\nsector.   This should send a very strong and positive signal  to\r\n\r\nour people and foreign investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures introduced by the Government could not have come at\r\n\r\na  more appropriate time.  The regional economic crisis,  as  we\r\n\r\nall  know,  has  led  to  a deepening of contrast  in  the  cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of the economies of the region.   The  weakening\r\n\r\nof  the  currencies  in  some  of  the  more  severely  affected\r\n\r\ncountries has made Singapore, which is relatively unaffected  by\r\n\r\nthe crisis, a much more expensive place to do business in.  This\r\n\r\nis  no  good  for us, especially when our economy is  very  much\r\n\r\nexport  driven.   Just looking at the cost  of  business  alone,\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  Thailand and Indonesia, by virtue of  their  currency\r\n\r\ndepreciation, which in some cases depreciated by more than  100%\r\n\r\nagainst  the US dollar since early last year, are now that  much\r\n\r\nmore competitive against Singapore's exports.  This, if not  for\r\n\r\nthe  other political problems that are confronting some  of  the\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the  region,  would  have  made  these  countries\r\n\r\nextremely  attractive alternative places for direct  investments\r\n\r\nor relocation of investments from Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree that cost cutting measures taken by our\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  help  to  provide  immediate  relief  to   our\r\n\r\nbusinesses, cutting business cost alone is not going to  be  the\r\n\r\nonly  long  term solution to sustaining or improving Singapore's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  against the region and the whole  world.   More\r\n\r\nmust  be  done.  Indeed, this was recommended by the  Committee.\r\n\r\nIn general, one must\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngo  beyond the symptomatic approach of cost cutting to one where\r\n\r\nparadigm  shifts and other strategies would have to be  engaged.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of the Committee, this was the approach taken.  As\r\n\r\nan  example, the Committee has boldly recommended that we should\r\n\r\nmove  away  from investor protection approach in regulating  the\r\n\r\nsecurities  industry  to  one  where  the  authorities  play   a\r\n\r\nsupervising  role,  ensuring  that the  market  is  sufficiently\r\n\r\ntransparent  to  allow the investor to make his own  independent\r\n\r\njudgment about investment decisions.  Leaving aside the question\r\n\r\nof   whether  or  not  this  is  an  acceptable  approach,   the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  does  suggest  a rather  radical  shift  in  the\r\n\r\nthinking of our policy makers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some ways, our country is now at the crossroads. The\r\n\r\neconomic crisis has brought upon us hardships for our people and\r\n\r\nour  businesses.  Yet, at the same time, there are opportunities\r\n\r\nand  challenges  that present itself.  We have  been  relatively\r\n\r\nunaffected by the contagion of the region.  Yet, we cannot  rest\r\n\r\non our complacence and not take advantage of this opportunity to\r\n\r\npull  ahead of competition.  In that sense, we should now  seize\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to redefine some of our economic goals and  the\r\n\r\nmeans by which these goals may be attained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has identified several strategies, by which it is\r\n\r\nhoped would help preserve Singapore's status as one of the  most\r\n\r\ncompetitive states in the world.  Most of the strategies did not\r\n\r\ncome as a surprise.  However, there are also many which are seen\r\n\r\nas bold initiatives for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support, in principle, the proposals of the Committee as\r\n\r\nset out in the Report.  The vision, as articulated by the\r\n\r\nCommittee, is one that I agree with, ie, making Singapore an\r\n\r\nadvanced and globally competitive knowledge economy within the\r\n\r\nnext decade, with manufacturing and services as the twin engines\r\n\r\nof growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is easy to identify with the broad proposals of the\r\n\r\nCommittee,  I do have a number of issues which I would  like  to\r\n\r\nraise  in  this  House.  Time does not permit me  to  cover  the\r\n\r\nproposals in a comprehensive manner.  I shall confine myself  to\r\n\r\nonly some of the recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manufacturing and Services as Twin Engines</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the importance of manufacturing and services\r\n\r\nas  important engines of growth for our economy.  Indeed,  since\r\n\r\nindependence,  our  high economic growth has  been  led  by  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector; hence, the emphasis on manufacturing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we recognise manufacturing as providing the engine of\r\n\r\ngrowth, I note, at the same time, our high dependence on  multi-national corporations (MNCs).  We are no doubt grateful to these\r\n\r\nMNCs   for  bringing  investments  to  Singapore  and  providing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with employment.  However, we should recognise that\r\n\r\nMNCs  are  not indigenous companies.  They are more likely  than\r\n\r\nlocal  companies  to  pull out their investments  and  cut  down\r\n\r\noperations in Singapore when it is expedient for them to do  so.\r\n\r\nWe  have  seen this in the mid-80s and how our employees  became\r\n\r\ndisplaced in the process.  These MNCs do not owe us a living and\r\n\r\nwe do not expect them to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of manufacturing, we should therefore hedge\r\n\r\nagainst  this  dislocation by continuing to concentrate  on  our\r\n\r\nlocal  enterprises.  We should build on our local  manufacturing\r\n\r\nbases.  The Report has quite correctly pointed out that we  need\r\n\r\nto build up a strong capability in all parts of the value chain.\r\n\r\nHopefully,  we  can nurture enough local companies  with  strong\r\n\r\ncapabilities  that  will  provide an alternative  base  for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector.  In this regard, we have  much  to  learn\r\n\r\nfrom  Taiwan  where the strength of the local small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises  have  helped  to shelter the  country  against  the\r\n\r\nforces of contagion which have affected the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recognise the need to strengthen our local\r\n\r\nmanufacturing capability.  We should do more to help  our  small\r\n\r\nand  medium  enterprises (SMEs).  We recognise  that  our  SMEs,\r\n\r\nbecause of their size, have inherent limitations.  I have spoken\r\n\r\nto many operators of SMEs and their feedback has a very familiar\r\n\r\nring  about it; limited access to funds, stiff competition  from\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked   companies,  and  a   perception   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment does not take them seriously enough.  I took  a  look\r\n\r\nat the participants of the CSC Report and I was sad to note that\r\n\r\na  committee  as  important as this, and for all the  importance\r\n\r\nthat  we  have attached to local companies, we have not included\r\n\r\nthe   Association  of  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  in   the\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Sir, I think this is a glaring omission.  I must, at\r\n\r\nthis  moment, declare my interest in the matter as a  member  of\r\n\r\nthe Association of Small and Medium Enterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we have various incentive schemes for the small\r\n\r\nand  medium  enterprises.  However, the feedback I got  is  that\r\n\r\nthese  schemes are rather difficult to apply for.  The  red-tape\r\n\r\nthat  the  applicant  has to go through is discouraging  enough.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme.  Will\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  kindly enlighten us on the extent  to  which  our\r\n\r\nlocal  companies have been successful in applying for  financial\r\n\r\nassistance through the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme in  the\r\n\r\nlast six months?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we have often heard the lament from our local\r\n\r\nbusinesses that every time they are reasonably successful in  an\r\n\r\narea  of  business,  the big local boys,  in  the  form  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies, will either come  to  compete  with\r\n\r\nthem, often unfairly because of their sheer size, or to buy them\r\n\r\nover.   We  have  seen this before, whether it  is  in  property\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  construction or even in the pastry business.   The\r\n\r\nnet effect of competition from the larger companies has been  to\r\n\r\ncrowd  out  the smaller companies.  Sir, we should,  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible, refrain from doing this if we are ever going  to  give\r\n\r\nthese  small and medium enterprises a fighting chance.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore urge that the new economic promotion agency\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  not repeat our oversight of concentrating on big foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  the  exclusion  of  the  smaller   players   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening the External Wing</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing the external wing as a means to hedge against\r\n\r\nthe risk of over reliance on the local economy is often seen  as\r\n\r\na  sound and effective strategy of our Government.  It has  been\r\n\r\nmore  than five years since we heard and, for some, heeded  that\r\n\r\ncall.   During that time, I can say that the experience of those\r\n\r\nwho have ventured overseas has been rather varied and different.\r\n\r\nSome  have found their investments profitable; most others  have\r\n\r\nfound the going tough.  Singaporeans, in their venture overseas,\r\n\r\nhave tended to rely on areas that they are most comfortable with\r\n\r\nand   perhaps   with  the  most  experience  in.   Consequently,\r\n\r\nSingapore  investments overseas are most visible  in  industrial\r\n\r\nparks,  hotel developments and office complexes.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthese  are  investments  that call for substantial  infusion  of\r\n\r\ncapital  and with long clawback periods for the initial  capital\r\n\r\ninjection.   The  extended period of time required  makes  these\r\n\r\ninvestments  rather vulnerable to the vagaries of  the  internal\r\n\r\nand external economies and politics.  When these companies first\r\n\r\nventured overseas, little did they realise that dealing with the\r\n\r\nlocal  governments and appreciating the extent  that  the  local\r\n\r\npolitics  can make a difference to the extent of the success  of\r\n\r\nthe venture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take our Suzhou Industrial Park, for example. This is\r\n\r\noften  seen  and  is, in fact, often touted as the  flagship  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's regionalisation programme overseas.  If we  look  at\r\n\r\nthe  development of the Suzhou Industrial Park,  we  have  every\r\n\r\nreason  to  be proud of its standing as representing  everything\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  stands  for.   Yet,  it  was  not  without  its\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   Some  years ago, we realised to our  consternation\r\n\r\nthat  the  Mayor  of Suzhou was undermining our  development  by\r\n\r\npromoting a rival industrial park there.  It took the efforts of\r\n\r\nour  Government and the influence of our Senior Minister Lee  to\r\n\r\nput  our position firmly with the Chinese that they cannot  take\r\n\r\nus for a ride.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Suzhou Industrial Park has the support of our\r\n\r\nGovernment.   What  about the other private Singapore  investors\r\n\r\nwho  answered the call of our Government to go overseas and  who\r\n\r\nrun into difficulties with unreasonable and bureaucratic foreign\r\n\r\nofficials?   Can our Government be there for them?  I  note  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of  the Committee to encourage  local  investors\r\n\r\noverseas  to  pool their resources together.  Sir, this  is  not\r\n\r\nenough.   We  should  have  strong Government  backing  for  our\r\n\r\noverseas investments.  This may be given through the setting  up\r\n\r\nof  specific Governme nt agencies, other than TDB, which can  be\r\n\r\nrelied  upon  to  assist our investors in a more dedicated  way.\r\n\r\nThis can include, for instance, helping them to resolve problems\r\n\r\nat  the  Governmental  level.  For countries  like  Vietnam  and\r\n\r\nChina,   businesses  are  often  carried  out  with   government\r\n\r\nagencies.   If  a  framework  can  be  established  whereby  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  can lend some official support and is  able  to  use\r\n\r\nthat to get the cooperation of their counterpart in the relevant\r\n\r\nplaces  in these countries, I believe it will help our investors\r\n\r\ngo a long way with their investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building world class companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has recommended that to be globally\r\n\r\ncompetitive, we need to be able to build up a stable of our  own\r\n\r\nworld-class  companies with core competencies that  can  compete\r\n\r\neffectively in the global economies.  To kick-start the process,\r\n\r\nit  is  recommended that Government-linked companies with  their\r\n\r\npresent  size, core capabilities and share of talents, are  best\r\n\r\nplaced  to lead the drive to kick-start the process of  building\r\n\r\nworld-class companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I agree that we should build up a stable of\r\n\r\nworld-class  companies, nurturing our own  companies  to  attain\r\n\r\nworld  class  status is not the only way.   In my  speech  at  a\r\n\r\nBudget debate, I had argued that we could have leap-frogged  the\r\n\r\nprocess by taking over some of the companies with leading  brand\r\n\r\nnames in the world.  This may be more advantageous than trying to \r\n\r\nnurture world-class\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies, as this gives us almost immediate  access\r\n\r\nto   markets   and  also  the  cutting  edge  in   technological\r\n\r\ndevelopments.   Rather than inventing the wheel, we  should  buy\r\n\r\nthe  wheel  and make further improvements to it.   We  have  the\r\n\r\nmoney for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, choosing our Government-linked companies to lead in\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  creating world-class companies raises  certain\r\n\r\nunderlying  issues about these companies and  their  roles.   We\r\n\r\nknow that Government-linked companies play an important role  in\r\n\r\nthe  development  of  our economies and have,  to  some  extent,\r\n\r\nhelped  build  our national profile in the global economy.   Our\r\n\r\nfavoured son, Singapore Airlines, for instance, has always  made\r\n\r\nus proud as an example of a world-class carrier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singapore Airlines is but one of the more\r\n\r\nprominent  example of the many Government-linked companies  that\r\n\r\nwe have in our stable.  Over the last decade, numerous companies\r\n\r\nand  subsidiaries  linked to the Government have  been  spawned,\r\n\r\nespecially   when  Government  functions  and  departments   are\r\n\r\nincreasingly being privatised and corporatised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government-linked companies are unusual and in a way\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  the  ordinary  private  sector  companies.   In\r\n\r\nshareholdings  and  management,  these  companies   have   close\r\n\r\nlinkages  to  the Government.  For many of these companies,  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  holds  a substantial portion, if  not  all,  of  the\r\n\r\nshareholdings  in  them.  Their corporate  management  is  often\r\n\r\nstaffed  by  those  who are seconded from the civil  service  or\r\n\r\nthose  who  had  retired from the civil  service.   Their  close\r\n\r\nassociation  with the Government has given these companies  some\r\n\r\nadvantages   in  their  dealings  with  clients  and   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these Government-linked companies are listed in the\r\n\r\nstock exchange and are thus subjected to the requirements of the\r\n\r\nstock exchange to observe the on-going process of corporate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisclosures  of  information.   This  requirement  of   relative\r\n\r\ntransparency provides some amount of discipline on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  company and is often seen as a principle of good  corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance.   In  a sense, shareholder and market accountability\r\n\r\nhelps to protect the shareholders' interest in their investments\r\n\r\nin the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is fine with listed companies. The question\r\n\r\nremains about the unlisted ones.  For these companies, which are\r\n\r\nnot  listed on the stock exchange, the perception is  that  they\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  subjected to the same discipline of accountability\r\n\r\nand  control as the listed ones.  The conduct of these companies\r\n\r\nis  quite naturally not as transparent as those that are  listed\r\n\r\non   the  stock  exchange.   There  is  not  enough  information\r\n\r\nfiltering through about these companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of ordinary companies, it is understandable\r\n\r\nthat  there is some amount of privacy that must be observed,  as\r\n\r\nthese are private shareholders' funds.  In the way in which  the\r\n\r\nprivate limited companies have developed, it is meant to provide\r\n\r\nthe  benefits of limited liability without at the same  time  of\r\n\r\nhaving  the  undue  burden  of  disclosing  too  much  corporate\r\n\r\ninformation  about the company, other than perhaps the  accounts\r\n\r\nfiled with the Registry of Companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are some who feel that private\r\n\r\nlimited  companies of the Government are not  private.   Because\r\n\r\nthe  funds held in these companies are those which belong to the\r\n\r\npublic,  there is some expectation that these companies be  made\r\n\r\nmore  transparent through greater disclosures to the public  and\r\n\r\nadopting  good principles of governance, which in this case  may\r\n\r\ninclude  indexes, for example, to show the extent of the  return\r\n\r\non  capital, and subjecting the managers to the same  forces  of\r\n\r\nthe  market discipline of hire and fire.  This will provide some\r\n\r\nassurance  to the public that even private limited companies  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government are properly run.  I am not saying for a moment,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  these companies are not properly run.  On the  other\r\n\r\nhand, I will be the first to say that we have some of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbest  companies  in this stable.  However, as the  saying  goes,\r\n\r\njustice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that these concerns have been generated in\r\n\r\nrecent  months by the high profile failures and acquisitions  of\r\n\r\nsome of our Government-linked companies.  The concern that I  am\r\n\r\nexpressing is that unless we can impose a framework for  greater\r\n\r\ndiscipline  among these companies, we may be exposing  ourselves\r\n\r\nto  greater weaknesses by encouraging these companies to  become\r\n\r\nworld-class  companies.  Spectacular world-class  companies  may\r\n\r\nalso   suffer  from  spectacular  world-class  failures.   These\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  not  created overnight  by  pouring  in  massive\r\n\r\ncapital  alone.  Therefore, I would cite caution in the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich we approach this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one more point that I would like to touch on\r\n\r\nbefore moving on.  Over the years, we have engendered the growth\r\n\r\nof   Government-linked  companies  that  are   multi-disciplined\r\n\r\nconglomerates.  We have GLCs, for instance, that have  interests\r\n\r\nranging from shipbuilding and repair to food retail outlets.  In\r\n\r\nrecent years, it became fashionable to form property development\r\n\r\ncompanies.  The fact is that many of our GLCs are into  property\r\n\r\ndevelopment and are often in direct competition with each other.\r\n\r\nThis  form  of  competition has resulted in  needless  waste  of\r\n\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest we get lost in the myriad of investment activities, we\r\n\r\nshould  ask  ourselves whether each GLC should seek to  redefine\r\n\r\nitself in terms of its core mission rather than reaching out all\r\n\r\nover, like the proverbial octopus.  I would argue that our  GLCs\r\n\r\nshould   take  a  step  backwards  and  re-examine  its  mission\r\n\r\nstatement.  To avoid wastage from unnecessary competition,  GLCs\r\n\r\nshould restructure its group holdings, get rid of its peripheral\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and be single-minded by concentrating  on  its  core\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  competition if it wants to compete on  the  world\r\n\r\nstage as a world-class company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Banking and finance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its sectoral report, the Committee recommended a number\r\n\r\nof  strategies to help make Singapore a premier financial hub in\r\n\r\nthe  region.  Among some of the strategies recommended  included\r\n\r\nthe  point  that  financial institutions should  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nassume  higher  risk  profiles that they  are  comfortable  with\r\n\r\nwithin  prudential  limit.  Along with the  suggestion,  it  was\r\n\r\nstated that the authorities should move away from protecting the\r\n\r\nindividual  investors  to  focusing on protecting  the  industry\r\n\r\nagainst systemic risks.  The Committee also reported that  over-protecting investors from specific asset risks also means losing\r\n\r\nout on potentially lucrative opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the stand taken by the Government\r\n\r\nhas  always  been on the basis of caveat emptor.  It also  means\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not the business of the Government to ensure  that\r\n\r\nevery  investment  made  by its people  will  be  rewarded  with\r\n\r\nsuccess.  While I agree with that principle, I would submit that\r\n\r\nthere  is a difference between allowing the people  to make  the\r\n\r\nfinal  choice of business as opposed to maintaining a  framework\r\n\r\nto  ensure information flow which is backed by legal sanction if\r\n\r\nnecessary, to allow investors to make the appropriate choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. Under our present laws, it would be an\r\n\r\noffence for anyone to offer securities to members of the  public\r\n\r\nwithout  complying with the necessary requirements of disclosure\r\n\r\nthrough  a  prospectus that must be filed with the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nCompanies.   The Act sets out the type and nature of information\r\n\r\nthat   must  be  provided  in  detail.   The  purpose  of   such\r\n\r\nrequirement, presumably, is to ensure that investors get  enough\r\n\r\ninformation about the company to make intelligent choices.  Such\r\n\r\nrequirements serve to protect the investors well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, such policy of investor protection does not\r\n\r\nseem  to  be  applied uniformly.  We seek to  protect  investors\r\n\r\nunder the Act in their investments in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsecurities.   However,  there  seems  to  be  a  gap  in   their\r\n\r\nprotection  when it comes to property investments overseas.   We\r\n\r\nsee  many  of  these  sad  stories in respect  of  our  people's\r\n\r\ninvestments in China.  I remember, in the early days some  years\r\n\r\nago, when China projects were first launched in Singapore, there\r\n\r\nwas  an  air  of excitement.  For land scarce Singaporeans,  the\r\n\r\nprospect  of  owning  a piece of sizable real  estate  in  China\r\n\r\ncheaply  and  at  a  price  which was  extremely  affordable  is\r\n\r\nsomething which is very attractive.  I remember saying to myself\r\n\r\nthen  that  it seemed a little anomalous that while we  required\r\n\r\npeople who sell securities to members of the public to make such\r\n\r\ndetailed disclosures in the prospectuses,  such requirements are\r\n\r\nnot necessary for people who sell properties in Singapore.  I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  the  developers who promote these projects  have  to\r\n\r\nswear   statutory  declarations  about  the   truth   of   their\r\n\r\nadvertisements,  neither  were they required  to  file  complete\r\n\r\ndetails  about their companies or its track record,  or  provide\r\n\r\nperformance bonds to any trustee in respect of the promotion  of\r\n\r\ntheir  developments.   Yet,  at  that  time,  there  were   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who went to such exhibitions and bought  properties\r\n\r\npurely on the basis of scale models of developments.  I remember\r\n\r\ntelling myself that some of these investors could get themselves\r\n\r\ninto trouble because of these relatively lax requirements.  Some\r\n\r\nyears  later,  I was right.  These days, it is not uncommon  for\r\n\r\npeople  to  complain about how they have been short  changed  in\r\n\r\ntheir  property purchases in China, and the sad  truth  is  that\r\n\r\nthere is very little they could do about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point is that while we may want to concentrate on\r\n\r\nfocusing  on  insulating our industry from  systemic  risks,  we\r\n\r\ncannot,  at  the same time, neglect our moral responsibility  of\r\n\r\nhaving   to   protect  our  own  investors  against   the   more\r\n\r\nunscrupulous promoters.  On the contrary, I would argue that  we\r\n\r\nshould review our laws to see how we may strengthen our laws  to\r\n\r\nprotect our investors even more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the strategies recommended by the CSC and the\r\n\r\nmeasures introduced\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  the  Government are indeed comprehensive and broad  ranging.\r\n\r\nOur  journey has only just begun.  However, while the  Committee\r\n\r\ncan  point us to the direction which Singapore should take,  for\r\n\r\nmany  of these strategies, there is substantial work to be done.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that our Government would be able to rise to the\r\n\r\noccasion.  I would urge all the people of Singapore to, at  this\r\n\r\ntime, close rank and stand behind our leaders as we work to pull\r\n\r\nSingapore  out  of this most serious challenge in recent  years.\r\n\r\nTogether, we will succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all Members who have spoken\r\n\r\nin support of the motion and for their strong endorsement of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the CSC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all, except possibly the Opposition Members, have\r\n\r\nstrongly  supported the recommendations, and this  is  extremely\r\n\r\nencouraging  for  the  CSC  members  and  all  others  who  have\r\n\r\ncontributed to the work.  In fact, it is difficult to understand\r\n\r\nwhy the Opposition Members are not supportive, because it is  so\r\n\r\nobvious  that the economy is in crisis and that it is  necessary\r\n\r\nfor all Singaporeans to pull together to ride out this crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM Lee has said, we are facing the toughest crisis\r\n\r\nsince  independence.  So it is important that we  do  the  right\r\n\r\nthings  and send the right message to the investors and stay  on\r\n\r\ntop of the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy that the Government has accepted the Report\r\n\r\nand all the key recommendations.  In fact, the package of short-term  measures  that  the Government has announced  exceeds  the\r\n\r\nexpectations  and the quantum is $10.5 billion,  which  is  more\r\n\r\nthan  the  figure  of $10 billion that the CSC  recommended.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the feedback from the ground is that people are generally\r\n\r\nquite happy, including those who have been critical in the past,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  did  not know what were the details  and  because\r\n\r\nthere was perhaps insufficient explanations at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the feedback, in fact, there was hardly any\r\n\r\ndissenting voice.  One criticism that came to mind is the one by\r\n\r\nMr Peh Chin Hua, that the quality of the paper was too good.  If\r\n\r\nthat is all, then I think we are on the right track.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee explained yesterday why we are taking this package\r\n\r\nof  measures  and  why our position seems to have  changed  from\r\n\r\nFebruary  when  we  were still thinking that we  could  register\r\n\r\nmaybe  between 2.5% and 4.5% growth this year.  He has explained\r\n\r\nthat  the  whole world has changed.  In fact, just a  few  weeks\r\n\r\nago,  people were worried that there could be a global  economic\r\n\r\nmelt-down.  Because of the measures taken by the Federal Reserve\r\n\r\nin  cutting  the interest rate and that the IMF package  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing  put  together for Brazil, people are now  breathing  more\r\n\r\neasily.  But I do not think we are out of the woods yet.  So  we\r\n\r\nneed to do our best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked how we arrived at this figure of\r\n\r\n15%  cut  in  wage cost, whether it was based on  hard  numbers,\r\n\r\npolitical bargaining or judgment.  The truthful answer  is  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  a gut feel.  It is based on our best judgment  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation,  based  on data that is available  and  also  on  the\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the  overall  economic  situation   and   the\r\n\r\ncompetition that we are facing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, those companies which are now faced with a sharp\r\n\r\nfall  in  demand  from the region, and these  are  mostly  local\r\n\r\ncompanies, are the ones which are most severely affected.  As Dr\r\n\r\nWang  Kai Yuen has mentioned, the response that he got fell into\r\n\r\ntwo  groups:  the local firms which are mainly directed  at  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  market  and the regional market.  They  are  the  ones\r\n\r\nasking for more measures because their demand has fallen off and\r\n\r\nthey  are faced with cash flow problems and they need more help.\r\n\r\nSo they are the ones who are probably asking for the 20%-30% cut\r\n\r\nin  their  cost.  On the other hand, some of the multi-nationals\r\n\r\nwho are here are in fact very pleased that we have been able  to\r\n\r\ndo  this.   And  Singapore is probably the only country  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  that  has  been able to mobilise everybody,  the  masses,\r\n\r\nthrough our trade unions,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith   our   strong  tripartite  cooperation,  and   cut   wages\r\n\r\nvoluntarily,  including the CPF.  So this is  a  strong  message\r\n\r\nthat  we are sending to investors, that Singapore is a different\r\n\r\nkind  of country.  We face up to the problems together,  and  we\r\n\r\nare  determined  to  work together as a  team  to  overcome  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met somebody from one of the top multi-national companies\r\n\r\njust  a  couple  of  weeks ago, and it was  his  first  time  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   He  is  from one of the top 500  companies  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   He was utterly impressed and he said, \"It is fantastic,\r\n\r\nyou  know.   You  have  this Singapore  Inc.  approach.\"   So  I\r\n\r\nexplained to him our measures and so on.  I hope at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe  day, he is going to put in more investments into Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn fact, his question was: where are the workers?  So I told him\r\n\r\nthat  we  now  have a relatively high unemployment rate  and  we\r\n\r\nintend  to allow more foreign workers in, if necessary,  and  we\r\n\r\nare  upgrading the industry all the time.  For projects that  we\r\n\r\nwant,  like  this  particular project which is in  the  computer\r\n\r\narea,  we  would try and free up the market and  allow  in  more\r\n\r\nworkers.   So,  as  I said, I hope we will get some  investments\r\n\r\nfrom that company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the MNCs which have links with the region, which have,\r\n\r\nfor example, subsidiary companies in Batam, and they are able to\r\n\r\ncontinue  operating,  they are less affected  by  the  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis.  These companies are able to take advantage of the lower\r\n\r\ncost as a result of the devaluation of currencies, and they  are\r\n\r\nhappy.   There  are also other sectors like the shipyards  which\r\n\r\nare  doing  all  right because their costs are local  and  their\r\n\r\nrevenues are in US dollars.  So they find that they are now more\r\n\r\ncompetitive  because they are competing with  Middle-east  yards\r\n\r\nand the currencies of the Middle-east are still strong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, having said all that, I think the general feeling of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  and  our statutory boards is that  we  have  lost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  The key figure that stands out is this loss of\r\n\r\nmarket share in the US.  As I mentioned in my speech,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nkicking off this debate, our share of exports of electronics  to\r\n\r\nthe  US has fallen by about two percentage points, from 9.3%  to\r\n\r\n7.3%, over a period of only 1 1/2 years or so.  So that is  very\r\n\r\nworrying for us because electronics form a very major sector  of\r\n\r\nour  economy, especially in the manufacturing sector,  and  they\r\n\r\nemploy  many  workers.  For the exports of non-oil  manufactured\r\n\r\nproducts, of that figure, more than 60% are electronics.  So you\r\n\r\nmust be able to compete in that area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the figures, we have seen increases in market share\r\n\r\nfrom  countries like Mexico, because of the NAFTA  factor,  from\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines, even from the PRC, even though they  have  not\r\n\r\ndevalued  their renminbi.  It shows how competitive their  costs\r\n\r\nare.   In  the case of the Philippines, they were under the  IMF\r\n\r\nregime  until recently.  They have not had the excesses  of  the\r\n\r\nother   neighbouring  countries.   So  their  economy  is  still\r\n\r\nfunctioning and I believe they are now very attractive to  quite\r\n\r\na  number  of  investors.   We see, for example,  that  Japanese\r\n\r\ncompanies are going there to manufacture disk drives,  and  they\r\n\r\nwill offer stiff competition to us here.  Most of our disk drive\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  are  from the US and we are one  of  the  biggest\r\n\r\nmanufacturers in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the feeling is that we have a gap over them in terms of\r\n\r\ncapability,  in  terms  of supporting industries,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nefficiency, but the gap is narrowing.  We have to cut our costs.\r\n\r\nBasically, the decision is that this time round, we must do a re-calibration of our costs downwards - wage costs and  other  cost\r\n\r\nfactors - and especially the land cost factor.  Because the  way\r\n\r\nthe  property market has been booming, it causes a lot of ripple\r\n\r\neffects,  not  only  in  terms of  the  market  rates  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will have to try and peg for our industrial land  but\r\n\r\nalso  in  terms of the other effects, the way they work  through\r\n\r\nthe  system, since land cost is a factor in every area,  whether\r\n\r\nit is transportation or utility, or what-have-you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment is that we do have to do a re-calibration, and\r\n\r\nthat  is why we came up with this figure.  I think 15% is  about\r\n\r\nright,  not too much, not too little.  Of course, we  only  know\r\n\r\nwhen we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimplement and we see what is the outcome.  And if we have to  do\r\n\r\nmore,  then we must do more.  But if we do better than expected,\r\n\r\nthen there could be corrections, there will be better bonus  for\r\n\r\nemployees and so forth.  Basically, this cut of 15% of wage cost\r\n\r\nwill  bring us back to the level of 1994, and at that  situation\r\n\r\nwe  were still very competitive.  In fact, the economy then  was\r\n\r\ngrowing  close  to 10% rate and the worry was  that  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket was getting too tight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way to look at this is that in 1985, when we had a\r\n\r\nsimilar recession and the GDP declined by about 2%, the CPF  was\r\n\r\ncut  by  15 percentage points, and that is equivalent to 12%  of\r\n\r\nwage  cost.  This time round, the assessment is that the  crisis\r\n\r\nis  more severe because it is a world-wide problem now.   So  we\r\n\r\nhave to take more drastic measures.  If you look at the currency\r\n\r\nvalues  too,  the  neighbouring currencies have  depreciated  by\r\n\r\nabout  20%  to  30% between 1st July last year  and  the  latest\r\n\r\nfigure,  as  compared to Singapore of about 12%.  The currencies\r\n\r\nhave  recovered  recently but we still have this  gap  over  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries of about 15% or so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have given Members some idea of how we sort of did a\r\n\r\ngut feel, assessed the situation, and came out with this figure.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not  want to overdo it because it is a balance.   If  we\r\n\r\noverdo   it,  then  people  become  very  depressed   and   very\r\n\r\npessimistic, and this could also dampen the demand in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to this point about the printing cost being too\r\n\r\nexpensive,  I was thinking, when I listened to the Member,  that\r\n\r\nif  we  had spent less money on poorer quality paper,  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  meant less business for the printers.  So it is a balance.\r\n\r\nDo  you  want  to  save  cost or do you want  to  stimulate  the\r\n\r\neconomy?  So we have to strike a balance here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is true that this $7 billion cut of wage\r\n\r\ncost  may  have some dampening effect on the economy.  Of  that,\r\n\r\nabout  $4  billion  will be CPF.  So there is no  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nfunds  from the economy.  But the balance could result  in  some\r\n\r\nwithdrawal of funds.  So I hope the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance will consider this factor and bring forward\r\n\r\nsome  stimulatory projects in the new budget and go for a bigger\r\n\r\nbudget  deficit,  so that we will be able to  keep  the  economy\r\n\r\ngoing.  The world-wide signal now is that it is time to reflate,\r\n\r\nbut at the same time, we must be able to compete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a criticism from quite a few Members that these\r\n\r\nmeasures came too late.  I have to answer this criticism because\r\n\r\nI  have been very involved in the whole process.  If Members may\r\n\r\nrecollect,  the  Prime Minister said, as far  back  as  November\r\n\r\n1996,  that  he felt that our costs were getting  out  of  line.\r\n\r\nTherefore, he was suggesting that we should have a committee  to\r\n\r\nreview the cost situation.  And that is how the CSC came  to  be\r\n\r\nformed  in May.  We could have formed it earlier but, of course,\r\n\r\nwe  had elections and all the process that we had to go through.\r\n\r\nSo this Committee was formed in May.  And when we first started,\r\n\r\nall of us were looking way ahead.  The economy was booming away,\r\n\r\nlabour  was tight, turnover was high, job-hopping was a problem.\r\n\r\nBut  when this crisis came in July, the whole situation changed.\r\n\r\nNow the worry is about unemployment rather than job-hopping.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cast your mind back, at that time, the whole situation\r\n\r\nwas  in turmoil.  The currency market and the stock market  were\r\n\r\nvery  volatile.  Everybody was very careful and anxious  not  to\r\n\r\nupset the market.  You do not want to send the wrong signal  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Oh, things are going to be terrible!\"  Because  then  the\r\n\r\nmarket  would  really go down and it would be a  self-fulfilling\r\n\r\naffair.  So when we came out with figures on GDP projections, we\r\n\r\ntended   to  be  careful,  to  be  realistic,  but  not   overly\r\n\r\npessimistic.  So, at that time, we felt that we might  still  be\r\n\r\nable, with our momentum of growth from past years, to make maybe\r\n\r\n3%  growth.  So the package of measures were tailored  for  that\r\n\r\nsituation.  It was kind of a measured approach.  On hindsight, I\r\n\r\nstill  think  that was the best way to do it.  Now that  we  are\r\n\r\nconvinced  that  the storm is really on us  and  it  is  a  very\r\n\r\nserious problem, our costs are really out of line, we have  come\r\n\r\nout with a very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbig  package of measures.  And we still have reserves  left,  in\r\n\r\ncase we have to do some more because the crisis is not over yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members mentioned the problem of liquidity. The feeling here is\r\n\r\nthat, generally, there has been no problem of liquidity squeeze.\r\n\r\nI  think  DPM  Lee,  in  some answers  to  oral  questions,  has\r\n\r\nexplained that, in fact, the bank lending has continued to grow,\r\n\r\nalthough at a slower rate.  The problem has been that the  banks\r\n\r\nare now naturally more cautious, and rightly so, because some of\r\n\r\nthem are so exposed in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have liberalised the Local Enterprise Finance\r\n\r\nScheme,  and I am glad to report that in terms of the short-term\r\n\r\nlending  for export factoring, for working capital,  the  demand\r\n\r\nand  the quantum of loans have really gone up.  But in terms  of\r\n\r\nloans  for  fixed assets, naturally companies are cautious.   So\r\n\r\nthe  quantum has not gone up that much.  The difficulty here  is\r\n\r\nthat we do not want to have a situation where our civil servants\r\n\r\ntry  and  second-guess  the bankers.   The  bankers  assess  the\r\n\r\napplications  and they decide whether they are worth  supporting\r\n\r\nor  not supporting.  As it is, we are sharing half the risk, and\r\n\r\nwe   are  giving  the  entire  spread  of  2 1/4%  on  both   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's share as well as their share entirely to the banks.\r\n\r\nThat  means they are earning a spread of about 4 1/2%  on  their\r\n\r\nloans.  It is, I think, adequate for the purpose.  But they have\r\n\r\nto  assess whether it is worth their while and safe for them  to\r\n\r\nlend.   In  cases  where the borrowers feel  that  they  deserve\r\n\r\nsomething  better, they can go and see PSB,  and  then  PSB  can\r\n\r\nperhaps  talk  to  the banks and discuss and see  whether  their\r\n\r\nassessment is correct.  At the end of the day, the decision must\r\n\r\nbe  made  by  the  banks.  Having said  that,  we  are  open  to\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  We  are studying this all the  time.   If  we  can\r\n\r\nliberalise this further in a safe way and extend this scheme  to\r\n\r\nmore sectors, we will be happy to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been concern for the retail sector, the sharp\r\n\r\ndecline in demand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas a result of the fall in tourist arrivals and the reduction in\r\n\r\nlocal spending.  Here, I think it is important for us to go  out\r\n\r\nand  get  more  business.  A short while ago, I was  just  at  a\r\n\r\nfunction to present the Tourism Awards and I announced that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Tourism Board would be spending $30 million more  next\r\n\r\nyear in its marketing efforts.  This will be on top of the usual\r\n\r\n$80 million per year that they spend on marketing.  So it is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of 40%.  This will tie in with the new programme  they\r\n\r\nhave  to launch to welcome the new millennium.  And I hope, with\r\n\r\nthis  effort,  we  will be able to increase  our  share  of  the\r\n\r\ntourism market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key thing here is that it is not enough just to cut cost.\r\n\r\nWe  must  all go out and try and get more business through  STB,\r\n\r\nthe  Trade Development Board and EDB, and they are all going  to\r\n\r\nwork that much harder to try and get business for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Members have spoken eloquently about the needs of the\r\n\r\nindividuals.  I think this is very important.  We not only  must\r\n\r\nensure that our costs are competitive but also that the needs of\r\n\r\nindividuals  who are affected are taken care  of.   One  way  of\r\n\r\ndoing  this  is through the CDCs, as mentioned by  quite  a  few\r\n\r\nMembers.  I personally will be in favour of providing more funds\r\n\r\nto  the  CDCs.   But,  again,  this depends  on  the  Ministries\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Remember that I am talking here as Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nCSC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few speakers, including the last Member to speak, Mr Sin Boon\r\n\r\nAnn,   have   been   quite  critical  of  the  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies.  I think some of the comments are valid.  Some of the\r\n\r\nGLCs  have, in fact, strayed from their core business.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  the  CSC  has come out with this recommendation  that  they\r\n\r\nshould focus on one area.  Even the big companies, like Sony and\r\n\r\nothers  have come to realise that they have gone into  too  many\r\n\r\nareas.   They have gone into movies.  They have gone into  what-have-you  and realise that they have to go back and  concentrate\r\n\r\non  areas  which they know well, because there is only  so  much\r\n\r\nmanagerial resource.  If you spread your management too  thinly,\r\n\r\nthen you cannot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlook after the business properly.  So the recommendation of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  is  that  the GLCs should refocus and  spearhead  our\r\n\r\nefforts into particular areas and, hopefully, they will be  able\r\n\r\nto  lead  us  in our regionalisation drive as well  by  bringing\r\n\r\nalong the supporting industries and the others.  This is an area\r\n\r\nwhich,  I  believe,  Temasek Holdings will be looking  carefully\r\n\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area I want to touch on briefly is this long-term\r\n\r\nvision  which  Members  have  supported  generally.   It  is  an\r\n\r\nambitious  but, I believe, achievable vision.  But it  may  take\r\n\r\nlonger than 10 years, I agree.  Some Members have said that,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  this  vision is not entirely new and that is  also  true.\r\n\r\nBecause we have been going on this track all this while  and  it\r\n\r\ngoes  to show that we are on the right track.  I remember  that,\r\n\r\nas far back as 1969, not quite 1969 when I joined EDB, but early\r\n\r\n1970s,  we  were  already  talking  of  having  brain  services,\r\n\r\npromoting  brain service industries.  So here, we  are  back  to\r\n\r\nknowledge industries.  We have done a lot since then,  the  kind\r\n\r\nof  manufacturing that we have gone into, wafer fabrication  and\r\n\r\nall that.  We have moved into more knowledge and skill-intensive\r\n\r\nareas,  and that is the correct thrust.  It is good for us  that\r\n\r\nwe  maintain this core of manufacturing.  I think Hong Kong  has\r\n\r\ncome  to realise too late.  They are hollowed out.  They  pushed\r\n\r\nall  this to Shenzhen and elsewhere and even though that is part\r\n\r\nof  China, and they are part of China, they have to compete very\r\n\r\nhard.   And now, what is the role for Hong Kong?  That is  their\r\n\r\nworry.  And that is why the CSC recommended that we should  have\r\n\r\nboth   manufacturing  and  services.   In  fact,  the  two   are\r\n\r\ncomplementary.   A  lot  of the services actually  are  for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,  whether  it  is  transportation,  logistics   or\r\n\r\nfinancing.   So  our aim should be to promote  high  value-added\r\n\r\nservices and manufacturing together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key areas that we will have to strive for is to\r\n\r\ntry  and  develop  technopreneurship.  This is  the  idea  of  a\r\n\r\nknowledge  economy  and  we  are studying,  of  course,  Silicon\r\n\r\nValley, looking at how Taiwan does it, how Israel does  it.   We\r\n\r\nare investing a lot of money in R&D.  The question is: can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  realise  more  returns from that?  It is good  to  build  up\r\n\r\ncapabilities and it is very important.  But, eventually, we must\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  have our own start-up companies,  float  them  and\r\n\r\ndevelop our own indigenous companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to mention that the Government is taking\r\n\r\nthis  effort very seriously.  The Government has decided to  set\r\n\r\nup a committee chaired by DPM Dr Tony Tan.  There is a committee\r\n\r\nknown  as  Technopreneur 21 Ministerial Committee (T21MC)  -  we\r\n\r\nhave  all  these acronyms nowadays - chaired by DPM Dr Tony  Tan\r\n\r\nand  there will be three other Ministers on this Committee.   My\r\n\r\ncolleague, BG George Yeo, will be Deputy Chairman and the others\r\n\r\nwill be Mr Lim Hng Kiang and RAdm Teo Chee Hean.  So you can see\r\n\r\nthat  it is a very high-powered Committee.  The intention is  to\r\n\r\ngive  this  area  a big push because I think this  area  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture, it has come with the development of computers, with  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of IT.  We have Singapore One.  We  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nmake more use of it.  I think we are really at the cutting edge.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether we have the talent.  Can we attract more\r\n\r\npeople  to  come here?  Can we link up with other countries  and\r\n\r\nachieve synergies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT is one big area. The other area will be in the life\r\n\r\nsciences.   Nowadays, it is possible for researchers  to  screen\r\n\r\ndrugs, millions of drugs in a short period of time.  So now with\r\n\r\nall  these new areas of cloning, cloning of heart tissue and  so\r\n\r\non,  these  will  be new growth industries  of  the  future.   I\r\n\r\nrealise there will be a lot of ethical problems as well.   These\r\n\r\nare growth industries and we should not miss out on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the investment in R&D, the setting-up of Science Parks,\r\n\r\nsetting-up  of  Incubator  Units,  providing  support   to   the\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs  who  are  usually more  scientifically  inclined\r\n\r\nrather than businessmen, holding their hands in business, and so\r\n\r\non.  These are things that we are putting in place.  And with Dr\r\n\r\nTony Tan and BG George Yeo who are very keen in this area, I  am\r\n\r\nsure we will see some progress in this sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is getting late and I do not want to prolong this\r\n\r\ndebate.   I  just  want  to  thank all  the  Members  for  their\r\n\r\ncontributions.  I am sure all their ideas will be considered.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  answer all the points today.  But the officers  who  are\r\n\r\nwatching  the closed circuit TV have been carefully taking  down\r\n\r\nall  the notes and all the points will be considered and,  where\r\n\r\nfeasible, they will be implemented.  Thank you.  [Applause].\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House endorses the strategies and policies set out in\r\n\r\nthe Report of the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness,\r\n\r\ncontained in Paper Misc. 3 of 1998, as the basis for\r\n\r\nstrengthening Singapore's competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I think\r\n\r\nwe  have heard enough today.
