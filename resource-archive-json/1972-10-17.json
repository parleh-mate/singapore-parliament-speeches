The Consultants have since submitted their\r\n\r\nreport  and  their recommendations  have  also  been\r\n\r\ncarefully examined and studied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing tariff structure is complicated and\r\n\r\nunwieldy.  To  give one example:  a  hotel  operator\r\n\r\ntoday pays his electricity bill based on three\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent tariffs. The Board's concern has  been  to\r\n\r\nreplace  the  existing outmoded set  of  tariffs  by\r\n\r\ntariffs   which   are  simple,  easily   understood,\r\n\r\nrational,  fair and equitable. The new tariffs  will\r\n\r\npromote  electricity consumption without  penalising\r\n\r\nthe  small  consumers.  The  primary  objective   of\r\n\r\nintroducing  the  new tariff is rationalisation  and\r\n\r\nnot the increase of revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Old Tariffs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing tariffs were formulated and developed\r\n\r\nwhen  the  maximum load arose from lighting  in  the\r\n\r\nevening.  It was then desirable to keep the  evening\r\n\r\npeak  as low as possible. This was to keep down  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  generators which had to be kept  running\r\n\r\nfor  only  two  or  three hours a day  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nevening   peak  demand.  Hence,  higher  rates   for\r\n\r\nlighting were charged since the major portion of the\r\n\r\ncosts  incurred  by the Electricity Department  were\r\n\r\nprincipally  to  meet  the  lighting  load  in   the\r\n\r\nevening.  The situation has now changed.  There  are\r\n\r\nnow three peak loads. One at 10.00 a.m., one at 4.00\r\n\r\np.m. in the evening, and one at 7.00 p.m. It  means\r\n\r\nthat  the cost of supplying electrical lighting  and\r\n\r\npower  to various consumer categories is nearly  the\r\n\r\nsame.  So  there is no point to meter  lighting  and\r\n\r\npower separately and charge differently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The New Tariffs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed to replace the existing twelve\r\n\r\ntariffs by six tariffs. The six new tariffs are: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The low tension domestic tariff for dwelling\r\n\r\nhouses.  There  are  231,808  accounts  under   this\r\n\r\ncategory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The low tension non-domestic tariff for\r\n\r\nshops,   offices,   small   industries   and   small\r\n\r\ncommercial   buildings.  There   are   40,696   such\r\n\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The high tension industrial tariff for large\r\n\r\nindustrial  concerns  using above  100,000  kilowatt\r\n\r\nhours (kwh) per month. 115 accounts come under  this\r\n\r\ncategory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The high tension non-industrial tariff for\r\n\r\nlarge   commercial   buildings,  hotels,   statutory\r\n\r\nboards, the armed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforces, etc. There are 98 such consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The entertainment tariff for the 54 existing\r\n\r\ntheatres and amusement parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) The public lighting tariff for public\r\n\r\nlighting and traffic lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for ease of reference. I have\r\n\r\nasked  to  be  handed to Members  a  Table* (*See Annex, cols 131-42)  showing\r\n\r\ndetails of the existing tariffs, interim tariffs and\r\n\r\nthe  new  tariffs  for the different  categories  of\r\n\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies of the Table handed in to the Clerk and\r\n\r\ndistributed to hon. Members].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Low Tension Domestic Tariff</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, as Members are aware, there are two\r\n\r\ndomestic lighting rates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a rate of 12 cents per kwh for a monthly\r\n\r\nconsumption of less than and up to 20 kwh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a flat rate of 18 cents per kwh for a monthly\r\n\r\nconsumption of more than 20 kwh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present domestic power consumption, i.e, power\r\n\r\nfor  cooking,  heating and all domestic  appliances,\r\n\r\nexcept  fans,  is charged at seven  cents  per  kwh.\r\n\r\nPower  for fans is charged the, lighting rate of  18\r\n\r\ncents  per  kwh.  This,  I think,  is  the  bone  of\r\n\r\ncontention  of  many Members, especially  those  who\r\n\r\nhave the welfare of the low consumers at heart.  The\r\n\r\nnew  tariff  will  do  away  with  this  anomaly  of\r\n\r\ncharging 18 cents per kwh for power for fans  and  a\r\n\r\nmuch lower rate for power for air-conditioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariff will be a simple single rate for\r\n\r\nboth lighting and power, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning                  Kwh                 Cents\r\n\r\nCharge                per month             per  kwh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1st Block    \t       1  -  20               12\r\n\r\n2nd Block   \t      21  - 750                8.25\r\n\r\n3rd Block           750 and above              7.25\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also be a minimum charge of $1.20 per\r\n\r\nmonth,  instead  of  the present minimum  charge  of\r\n\r\n$1.50, separately for lighting and for power, making\r\n\r\na total of $3.00. At present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndomestic consumers using lighting and power have  to\r\n\r\npay  a minimum charge of $1.50 for metering of power\r\n\r\nand  $1.50  for the metering of lighting,  making  a\r\n\r\ntotal of $3.00 per month. In place of this, we  will\r\n\r\nnow have a minimum charge of $1.20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Financial Effects of New Tariffs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are altogether 231,808 domestic consumers.\r\n\r\nThey  use  only  21  per cent  of  total  electrical\r\n\r\nenergy.  Under the new tariff they will collectively\r\n\r\npay  3  per cent less, i.e, the PUB will lose 3  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  its  present revenue from  these  domestic\r\n\r\nconsumers.  About 61 per cent, or 141,771  of  these\r\n\r\nconsumers  to  be  exact, use 20 units  or  less  of\r\n\r\nlighting. They now pay 12 cents per unit.  Of  these\r\n\r\n141,771  consumers using 20 or less units per  month\r\n\r\nof  lighting,  33,707 will pay less  under  the  new\r\n\r\ntariffs.  They are the small consumers who use  less\r\n\r\nthan  30  units  of electricity for both  power  and\r\n\r\nlighting. They have a rebate through the new minimum\r\n\r\ncharge  of  $1.20  as  against the  present  minimum\r\n\r\ncharge of $3.00 per month (i.e., as I have explained\r\n\r\njust  now,  $1.50  minimum charge for  lighting  and\r\n\r\n$1.50  for power). The rest of the 141,771 consumers\r\n\r\nof  domestic lighting and power, i.e, the  remaining\r\n\r\n108,064 consumers will pay slightly more.

The maximum  demand\r\n\r\ncharge  will  encourage  consumers  to  lower  their\r\n\r\nmaximum  demand for short periods and  spread  their\r\n\r\nconsumption  over longer periods.  Thus,  they  will\r\n\r\ninstead  help  to  lower  the  cost  per  unit   for\r\n\r\nthemselves. By lowering the maximum demand for short\r\n\r\nperiods,  they  will  also help  the  PUB  to  defer\r\n\r\ncapital  investment in new cables,  switchgears  and\r\n\r\npower generating plants. Let me give you an example.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, if a consumer like a factory requires\r\n\r\n100,000 kwh a month, it could schedule its load  for\r\n\r\nthree  shifts  and require at most only  200  kw  of\r\n\r\ndemand.  However, if it works on one shift, it  will\r\n\r\nrequire  up to 600 kw of demand increasing the  need\r\n\r\nfor  more  power generating plants, switchgears  and\r\n\r\nother equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a declared demand charge. This\r\n\r\ncharge is to discourage consumers from asking for  a\r\n\r\ngreater supply of electricity than they require. For\r\n\r\ninstance, a consumer like an oil refinery or a steel\r\n\r\nmill  requires only 25 megawatts. But, to  be  safe,\r\n\r\nthey  ask  the PUB to provide facilities  to  supply\r\n\r\nthem with 50 megawatts. This means\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspending   unnecessary   capital   expenditure    on\r\n\r\nprovision of equipment such as switchgears,  cables,\r\n\r\nsubstations, etc, for 50 megawatts instead of 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said earlier that it is expected that the\r\n\r\n80  consumers who are receiving low tension supplies\r\n\r\nwill  convert  to  high tension  supplies.

The new tariff is also known as a two-part\r\n\r\ntariff with a maximum demand charge of $4.50 per  kw\r\n\r\nper month. For similar reason as I have just stated,\r\n\r\nit  is expected that the 71 consumers receiving  low\r\n\r\ntension   supplies  will  convert  to  high  tension\r\n\r\nsupplies.

However,  the  two   tariff\r\n\r\ncategories applicable to them are consolidated  into\r\n\r\none (both rates being the same).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Fuel Oil Variation Clause</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important feature of the new tariff structure\r\n\r\nis the fuel oil variation clause. It will be applied\r\n\r\nuniformly to all the six new tariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are completely dependent upon imported fuel\r\n\r\noil.  It  accounts for 35 per cent of our  operating\r\n\r\nexpenditure  excluding capital cost.  The  fuel  oil\r\n\r\nvariation  clause provides that the  cost  of  every\r\n\r\nkilowatt  hour  shall be increased or  decreased  by\r\n\r\n0.0033  cent for every 10-cent increase or  decrease\r\n\r\nper  ton in the cost of fuel oil. The increase  will\r\n\r\nbe  calculated over a basic oil price of $40 per ton\r\n\r\nand  the decrease under a basic oil price of $38 per\r\n\r\nton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although prices of oil have been reasonably stable\r\n\r\nfor many years, there was an increase of 30 per cent\r\n\r\nin  fuel  oil prices to the Board since early  1971.\r\n\r\nThere  is  possibility of further increases  as  the\r\n\r\nOPEC  countries  charge higher royalties  for  their\r\n\r\ncrude  oil. For this reason, a fuel price adjustment\r\n\r\nin  tariffs  for  all consumers is necessary.  There\r\n\r\nwill be no need for tariff changes with every change\r\n\r\nin oil prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Interim Tariffs</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must inform the House that, pending the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  the single meter tariffs,  several\r\n\r\ninterim  tariffs have been implemented. Anticipating\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of single meter tariffs, the Board\r\n\r\nin  1969  advised hotels under construction to  wire\r\n\r\ntheir premises with a single distribution system for\r\n\r\nlighting  and  power instead of  having  a  separate\r\n\r\nwiring circuit for each. On completion, these hotels\r\n\r\nwere charged the interim rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former British bases and some Government and\r\n\r\nStatutory Board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquarters  for  employees were metered  on  a  single\r\n\r\nwiring system for lighting and power, and they  were\r\n\r\ncharged  a bulk rate. Those occupying these premises\r\n\r\nale   now  required  to  have  separate  meters  for\r\n\r\nseparate consumers. They also had been placed on the\r\n\r\ninterim tariff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Summary</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, of the six new electricity tariffs,\r\n\r\ni.e, the  Low Tension Domestic Tariff, Low  Tension\r\n\r\nNon-Domestic  Tariff  and Entertainment  Tariff  are\r\n\r\nblock  rates  metered on a single  meter.  The  High\r\n\r\nTension  Industrial and High Tension  Non-Industrial\r\n\r\nTariffs,  which are known as two-part tariffs,  also\r\n\r\nhave  block  rates for units consumed.  However,  in\r\n\r\naddition,  they  will contain a  flat  rate  maximum\r\n\r\ndemand charge. The Public Lighting Tariff is a  flat\r\n\r\nrate tariff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariffs do not require separate lighting\r\n\r\nand power circuits. Thus, developers of all types of\r\n\r\nproperty will benefit from lower capital expenditure\r\n\r\non  electrical installations. Householders  also  in\r\n\r\nfuture will pay less for their internal wiring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The block rates of all the new tariffs are\r\n\r\npromotional.   The  greater  the  consumption,   the\r\n\r\ncheaper  the rates become. With the new High Tension\r\n\r\nTariffs, industrial and non-industrial users  taking\r\n\r\nsupplies  at high voltage can reduce their bills  by\r\n\r\nreducing their maximum demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new High Tension Tariffs are lower than the\r\n\r\nnew  Low  Tension  Tariffs. But to convert  to  High\r\n\r\nTension  supplies, consumers will have to invest  in\r\n\r\ncapital equipment. Nevertheless, it is expected that\r\n\r\nlarge  Low  Tension consumers will  switch  to  High\r\n\r\nTension  supplies, because they will  recover  their\r\n\r\ncapital  investment in one or two years through  the\r\n\r\nlower tariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All new tariffs carry a Fuel Oil Variation Clause\r\n\r\nto  avoid messy revisions of the tariff rates  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of increases in fuel oil prices by increased\r\n\r\nroyalties imposed by the OPEC countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<i>Introduction of New Tariffs in December</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariffs will be introduced from the\r\n\r\nDecember  billing cycle. Gazette notifications  will\r\n\r\nbe  published  accordingly. In a general  adjustment\r\n\r\nand  rationalisation  of tariffs  covering  so  many\r\n\r\ndifferent rates and categories, it is impossible  to\r\n\r\nintroduce a new set of tariffs which will enable the\r\n\r\nmany categories of consumers to pay exactly the same\r\n\r\nas under the old tariffs. It is inevitable that some\r\n\r\nwill have to pay more and some slightly less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasize, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this\r\n\r\nchange  to  be  introduced in  December  is  not  to\r\n\r\nincrease the revenue of the PUB. In fact, as I  have\r\n\r\nstated,  the PUB's revenue estimates for  1973  show\r\n\r\nthat  receipts will be $1.8 million less  under  the\r\n\r\nnew  tariffs. The PUB will also have to spend  about\r\n\r\n$1  million  to  convert the existing  240,000  dual\r\n\r\nmeter accounts to single meter accounts. In the long\r\n\r\nterm,  however,  there will be  savings  in  capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure as the recovered meters can be used  for\r\n\r\nnew  consumers or to replace old meters. There  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  savings  in administration  costs  because\r\n\r\ninstead  of reading two meters, only one meter  need\r\n\r\nbe read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tariff structure is in line with latest\r\n\r\npractice.  It is simple and clear-cut, rational  and\r\n\r\nfair,  because it does not discriminate between  the\r\n\r\nuse of electricity for lighting and power. The small\r\n\r\nconsumers benefit. Those who consume less than or up\r\n\r\nto 30 kwh per month for both power and lighting will\r\n\r\npay less under the new tariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the greater the consumption,\r\n\r\nthe  lower the rates, therefore benefitting also the\r\n\r\nlarge  consumers. This new tariff also  removes  the\r\n\r\nanomaly.  As  I  have said earlier,  of  charging  a\r\n\r\nhigher  rate  of  electricity for  use  of  fans  as\r\n\r\nagainst  use of air-conditioning and other  domestic\r\n\r\npower appliances. It saves all consumers expenditure\r\n\r\nby making unnecessary duplicate wiring circuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the public, including hon.\r\n\r\nMembers, will benefit from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  tariffs.

The PUB's revenue for electricity in 1973\r\n\r\nunder  the new tariffs, as compared to the  existing\r\n\r\ntariffs, will be less by $1.8 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\non  a  point of clarification.

The second  point  is\r\n\r\nwhether,  in  the review of the old tariff,  through\r\n\r\nthe  interim tariff, and on to the new tariff  which\r\n\r\ntook   three   years   of  study,   consumers   were\r\n\r\nrepresented or consulted in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, I would like to take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to enquire from the Minister  into\r\n\r\nthe  reason  for the fairly substantial increase  in\r\n\r\nthe PUB bills of many consumers in recent months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  a  couple of questions?  (1)  He  has  not\r\n\r\nactually  given  a breakdown of consumption  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial-class.  Will the introduction  of  these  new\r\n\r\nrates  affect  the lower income group,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  poor and living in the  $20-a-month\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board cats? (2)  I  notice\r\n\r\nthat the Minister has given us figures which, to  my\r\n\r\nmind,  are  too many for us to study at  this  hour.\r\n\r\nAnyway, he did say that those who consume up  to  33\r\n\r\nkwh  per  month and those who largely consume  power\r\n\r\nwill benefit from these new rates. Who then will  be\r\n\r\nthe ones who have to pay more?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister three\r\n\r\nquestions.  The  Statement  given  by  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncontains  many  figures and terms. Many  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  and I believe some Ministers  too,  are\r\n\r\nconfused by such figures and terms. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould like to know whether the small consumers  will\r\n\r\npay   less  after  the  introduction  of  these  new\r\n\r\ntariffs. If they have to pay more, then it will  not\r\n\r\nbe  beneficial to them. It will be a greater  burden\r\n\r\nto  them.  Secondly,  since our  generators  produce\r\n\r\nenough  supply  of electricity, we should  encourage\r\n\r\nconsumers  to  use  more electricity  so  that  more\r\n\r\nrevenue  can be collected by the PUB. In  this  way,\r\n\r\nwith more revenue, I believe it is not necessary for\r\n\r\nthe PUB to introduce these new consolidated tariffs.\r\n\r\nThe third question is this. With this new tariff,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know  whether  the  PUB  will  also\r\n\r\nintroduce a uniform tariff for water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask The Minister one very simple point\r\n\r\nof   clarification.  He  mentioned  that  with   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the new tariff, the revenue  of  the\r\n\r\nPUB  will be less by approximately $1.8 million, and\r\n\r\nthat  it  will  cost  the PUB approximately  over  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars to switch over to the single  meter\r\n\r\nsystem.  The  Minister mentioned  that  in  the  new\r\n\r\nsystem  there would be savings in the administrative\r\n\r\ncost,  but  he did not indicate the figures.  I  was\r\n\r\njust wondering how much savings there will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask a very simple question.  It  is\r\n\r\nabout  meter readers. Whenever meter readers take  a\r\n\r\nreading  of  the  meters, the consumption  seems  to\r\n\r\nincrease every month. Will the Minister do something\r\n\r\nabout that? While he is equalising the rates on  the\r\n\r\none hand, he is increasing the meter readings on the\r\n\r\nother.  Will  the  Minister look  into  this  matter\r\n\r\nfirst, after introducing the new tariff?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, to take\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang. I do not know whether  he\r\n\r\nwas  paying very close attention to my Statement  or\r\n\r\nnot. I have already stated that the new tariff is  a\r\n\r\npromotional tariff. Therefore, if you use more,  the\r\n\r\nrates  will be less. Thus, it encourages  people  to\r\n\r\nuse more. So it is promotional,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat is why there is a new tariff. But he says there\r\n\r\nis no need for a new tariff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwh is a unit of measurement of the amount of\r\n\r\nelectricity consumed, just as it is so many  gallons\r\n\r\nof   water,  it  is  so  many  kilowatt   hours   of\r\n\r\nelectricity; that is the simple explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also stated that it is not possible in a\r\n\r\nreview of this nature to see that everybody pays the\r\n\r\nsame rate. Our main concern is to see that the small\r\n\r\nconsumers  or  those people who live,  as  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  said,  in $20-a-month Housing  Board  flats,\r\n\r\nshould  not be asked to pay more. I have  said  that\r\n\r\nthose who use a combined total of 30 kwh or less  of\r\n\r\nelectricity  per month for both power  and  lighting\r\n\r\nwill  pay less. There is the question that  if  some\r\n\r\npeople pay less, who pays more? Let me tell him  who\r\n\r\npays  more. I, for one, will be paying more  because\r\n\r\nof air conditioning, for which I use more power than\r\n\r\nlighting. As I have explained, the cost of supplying\r\n\r\nelectricity, either for power or lighting, is  about\r\n\r\nthe  same.  So  the charges should be the  same.  At\r\n\r\npresent,  the  rate for lighting is higher.  We  are\r\n\r\npaying  18 cents per unit for lighting, and  only  7\r\n\r\ncents per unit for power. It means that lighting has\r\n\r\nbeen subsidising power. So now, those people who use\r\n\r\npower are now asked to pay their due share and those\r\n\r\npeople  who  have  been paying  a  higher  rate  for\r\n\r\nlighting, well, they do not have to subsidise  those\r\n\r\nwho use power. Therefore, in toto, if you use a very\r\n\r\nlarge proportion of power, compared to lighting, you\r\n\r\nwill  now have to pay more, and this is as it should\r\n\r\nbe.  That is why I have said that the new tariff  is\r\n\r\nfair, equitable and just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other question of how much savings\r\n\r\nthere  will be in administrative costs, I hope there\r\n\r\nwill  be  some  savings. But  it  is  too  early  to\r\n\r\nanticipate the amount. There are priorities.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot  spend our time calculating something  which  we\r\n\r\nare not very sure of. Probably, by the time when  we\r\n\r\nsit  for  our 1973-74 Estimates, and if the question\r\n\r\nis raised again, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay be able to give an answer. Otherwise, it is just\r\n\r\nfutile because, as you have heard from my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister, yesterday, there  will  be  a\r\n\r\nreview  of  salaries for those whose  salaries  have\r\n\r\nstagnated.  Therefore, all these have  to  be  taken\r\n\r\ninto consideration before we make the calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why the new rate should take effect on 1st\r\n\r\nDecember  and  not 1st January, 1973, we  have  been\r\n\r\nstudying this question for three years, and I  think\r\n\r\nDecember  is  a  good time because  people  will  be\r\n\r\ncelebrating Christmas and the New Year, and they can\r\n\r\nturn  on  more  lights as lighting  will  then  cost\r\n\r\nbetween  8 1/4 cents and 7 1/4 cents, instead  of  18\r\n\r\ncents.  I think it is a good month to start the  new\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

I do not know how or in  what  way\r\n\r\nthey read the meter. He must check on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, we are on new tariffs. On\r\n\r\nthis  question of wrong reading of meters, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  we  have a quarter million domestic consumers\r\n\r\naltogether. If there are only one or two complaints,\r\n\r\nit  is  largely  because probably consumers  do  not\r\n\r\nrealise  that  they have used more.  However,  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  a mistake or where the meter  is  out  of\r\n\r\norder,  we always investigate the complaint. When  a\r\n\r\nconsumer's bill goes up every month, then  something\r\n\r\nmay be wrong. I, too, have received a complaint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  a  consumer saying that his bill for the  last\r\n\r\nmonth has more than doubled. I asked, \"What did  you\r\n\r\ndo  during that month?\" He said, \"We had a  marriage\r\n\r\nin  the  house.\" So there you are. Things like  this\r\n\r\nhappen.  The consumer is not consciously aware  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  occasions when he has to use  more.  But\r\n\r\nwhere  there  are legitimate complaints,  we  always\r\n\r\nlook into them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you asking a supplementary\r\n\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Just a point of\r\n\r\nclarification, Sir, Mr Speaker, Sir, at the  present\r\n\r\nmoment  there  are two meters, one for lighting  and\r\n\r\nthe other for power.

Secondly, let me  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  express my satisfaction of the  policies\r\n\r\ncontained  in the Speech. The President has  pointed\r\n\r\nout that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`when the last Parliament was convened, the\r\n\r\nprospects were grim. We faced the stark question  of\r\n\r\nsurvival:  how to hold up the economy,  to  generate\r\n\r\njobs, of any kind, to mop up massive unemployment...\r\n\r\nToday's  continuing and controlled  boom  is  giving\r\n\r\nSingapore  that glow of success. There  is  a  bloom\r\n\r\nwhich  will  spread from the city to the new  towns,\r\n\r\nand  through  to  the villages and kampongs  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That we have achieved the good results today is  due\r\n\r\nentirely  to  our  decisive will to  succeed,  sheer\r\n\r\ndetermination, hard work, and realistic planning. We\r\n\r\nhave overcome the many difficulties then facing  us,\r\n\r\nand  have  achieved  the  targets  we  set  out   to\r\n\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are several points arising out of the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Speech  which I would  like  to  raise.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is about the re-adjustment of the salary\r\n\r\nscales and terms and conditions of service of  civil\r\n\r\nservants.  The  Addendum to the  President's  Speech\r\n\r\npointed out that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is necessary to re-examine once again the\r\n\r\nstructure of pay and service conditions and to  make\r\n\r\nthe  rewards  in  certain  departments,  ministries,\r\n\r\ngrades and professions more comparable to what  they\r\n\r\ncan get in the private sector.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  suggestion is very good. However, the question\r\n\r\nis whether this adjustment will involve only a small\r\n\r\ngroup  of  senior  officers or all  civil  servants,\r\n\r\nincluding  those  in  Divisions  II,  III,  and  IV.\r\n\r\nSeveral  years ago, the Government set  up  a  Civil\r\n\r\nService  Salary Adjustment Committee. They submitted\r\n\r\ntheir  recommendations which benefited  only  a  few\r\n\r\nsenior  officers. Civil servants in the lower  ranks\r\n\r\ndid  not  benefit  by the adjustment.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to suggest here that the re-adjustment of\r\n\r\nthe  Civil Service salary structures should  not  be\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory, benefiting only the senior officers,\r\n\r\nand not the lower ranks of civil servants. In actual\r\n\r\nfact, the re-adjustment in salary structure is  more\r\n\r\npressing  for  the  lower  ranks  than  for   senior\r\n\r\nofficers to whom a small adjustment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  insignificant. It is just like a  drop  of\r\n\r\nwater  in  the  ocean  to senior  officers.  But  to\r\n\r\nofficers in the lower ranks, it is like a dewdrop in\r\n\r\na  season  of drought: or it is like providing  them\r\n\r\nwith  charcoal during winter. The re-adjustment will\r\n\r\nbenefit  them  very much. Therefore, a comprehensive\r\n\r\nsalary  re-adjustment is very necessary and this  is\r\n\r\nalso a pressing requirement of the general rungs  of\r\n\r\nthe civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to look into the question\r\n\r\nof  why  some  people  are not  satisfied  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We all know that although  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  won  a  decisive  victory  in  the  last\r\n\r\ngeneral elections, there are still about 30 per cent\r\n\r\nof our electorate who cast votes for the opposition.\r\n\r\nThere  must be some reason for this. Sir, I remember\r\n\r\nthat when we separated from Malaysia, our Government\r\n\r\nhad  to make the people struggle very hard for their\r\n\r\nsurvival. And now we have achieved definite results.\r\n\r\nAt  present, it is not a question of survival of our\r\n\r\npeople  as  our prosperity has topped the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSoutheast   Asia  and  it  can  even  compare   very\r\n\r\nfavourably  with  that of the Western  and  American\r\n\r\ncountries.  Living  in  this fortunate  environment,\r\n\r\nexcept  for a very few extremists, chauvinists,  and\r\n\r\nracialists,  why  should they  want  to  oppose  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?   I  think  it  might  be  because   the\r\n\r\nGovernment in implementing its policies had been too\r\n\r\nharsh  or  hasty and neglecting the basic livelihood\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  For example, in  implementing  our\r\n\r\nurban  renewal  programme the Government  has  given\r\n\r\npriority  of Housing Board flats to people  affected\r\n\r\nby  the  resettlement programme. The Government  has\r\n\r\nalso  given them compensation and removal  expenses.\r\n\r\nIn  view of this, the Government can be said to have\r\n\r\ndone  its  best  to  help  the  people  to  resettle\r\n\r\ncomfortably. However, the Government has not gone  a\r\n\r\nstep further to resolve the problem of livelihood of\r\n\r\nthese  people. Because of this they are dissatisfied\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government. For instance, those who  were\r\n\r\naffected   by  resettlement  were  originally   sub-tenants,  and many of them are families  of  six  or\r\n\r\nseven each. They had been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npaying  rentals  of $15 or $20 per month,  but  upon\r\n\r\nresettlement in Housing Board flats they had to  pay\r\n\r\ndouble  or even treble the rate. This had inevitably\r\n\r\nincreased  their burden. They had no choice  but  to\r\n\r\nmove  out. However, it was difficult to remove,  and\r\n\r\nthus  their cause for dissatisfaction. Here I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to  suggest  that  in  future  whenever   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  implements any policy that  affects  the\r\n\r\npeople,  it  should give the people  ample  time  to\r\n\r\nadjust  to  the  changed situation. Secondly,  there\r\n\r\nshould   be   co-ordination   between   Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament and local leaders, who could make on-the-spot   investigations  so  that  they  could  better\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  actual  living  conditions  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  populace  and to enable the  Government  to\r\n\r\ndraw  up  plans and policies in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nsurveys  obtained. This would meet the  requirements\r\n\r\nof  the  people and would facilitate persuasion,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  people  would  not  have  any  reason  to\r\n\r\ncomplain against the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to touch upon the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the road traffic system. It cannot\r\n\r\nbe  denied  that  since  the reorganisation  of  our\r\n\r\npublic  transport, the bus services are much  better\r\n\r\nthan  before. This, of course, is a mailer for  joy.\r\n\r\nToday,  many  people need to spend a  few  cents  to\r\n\r\ntravel  by  bus  from  one corner  of  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nanother.  However, this reorganisation  has  brought\r\n\r\nabout  many  problems. First of  all,  it  adversely\r\n\r\naffects  the livelihood of the taxi drivers  because\r\n\r\nwith  so many buses running along so many roads  and\r\n\r\nwith  such  convenience and cheap means of transport\r\n\r\nmany people want to travel by bus. As a result,  the\r\n\r\nincome  of the taxi drivers has dropped very  badly.\r\n\r\nIf   this  trend  were  to  continue  further,   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  now  faced by the taxi  drivers  would\r\n\r\nbecome worse. Therefore, I would like to remind  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to pay attention to the problem  of  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of the taxi drivers. Secondly,  the  bus\r\n\r\nservices  along  so many roads, big or  small,  have\r\n\r\ncaused  greater  congestion along these  roads.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in MacPherson district there is  a  small\r\n\r\nroad  called  Circuit Road which is not  very  wide.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the vehicular traffic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is already quite heavy. But now, with buses\r\n\r\nrunning along this road, the traffic is even  more\r\n\r\ncongested.  This  is only one example.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany   other  streets  and  roads  in   the   same\r\n\r\nsituation.  I hope the Minister for Communications\r\n\r\nwill  pay  attention to this undesirable situation\r\n\r\nand  try to rectify it so that our road system can\r\n\r\nbe improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  in  support of the motion  to  thank  the\r\n\r\nPresident  for  his speech. In his speech  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  the President has charted out the path  of\r\n\r\nprogress for the nation in the next few years.  We\r\n\r\nowe  our  present well-being to hard work  in  the\r\n\r\npast;  hard work it shall have to be if we are  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to prosper. As we become more  affluent,\r\n\r\nwe  shall  have more to spend and to save.  Whilst\r\n\r\nspending  is a relatively simple matter,  although\r\n\r\nsome  people  seem  to have difficulties  spending\r\n\r\nwithin   their  means,  saving  can   pose   quite\r\n\r\nconsiderable  problems. It is perhaps  unnecessary\r\n\r\nfor  me  to enumerate the many painful experiences\r\n\r\nwhich  some  of  our citizens have had  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.  By  putting  their savings  in  the  wrong\r\n\r\nplaces or in wrong hands, they have had their hard-earned  savings  taken away from  them  overnight.\r\n\r\nWhat  has happened is history. My present  concern\r\n\r\nis  the  future  security of the  savings  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens, particularly the large majority  of  the\r\n\r\nworking class people. Ideally, I would like to see\r\n\r\nmost  of  the  savings going to  the  Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank or perhaps the other well established\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions, but  as  there  are  many\r\n\r\nother  competing alternatives offering what appear\r\n\r\nto  be  attractive propositions in terms  of  high\r\n\r\nrates  of returns for those who are eager  to  see\r\n\r\ntheir  money  grow, security becomes a  matter  of\r\n\r\nsome concern. As such, I feel that it is essential\r\n\r\nat this juncture for the Government to take a good\r\n\r\nlook  at  some  of  the existing outlets  for  our\r\n\r\nnational savings, with a view to ensuring  as  far\r\n\r\nas  it is possible by legislative means that these\r\n\r\noutlets are safe for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  citizens to leave their money with. One  area\r\n\r\nthat  immediately  comes  to  mind  is  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange where we find today people from all walks\r\n\r\nof  life playing \"Bulls and Bears\", and many  have\r\n\r\nhad  their  lingers burned. Here, are we satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  everything possible has been  done  to  curb\r\n\r\nexcessive speculation and manipulation which, more\r\n\r\noften than not, benefits a resourceful few at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of a vast number of small investors? There\r\n\r\nhas been a suggestion that an independent watchdog\r\n\r\ncommittee  be  set  up  to  keep  an  eye  on  the\r\n\r\nactivities of the Exchange, but to-date  this  has\r\n\r\nremained a point of academic interest leaving  the\r\n\r\nExchange  to  continue  to  operate  as  a   self-regulating body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we become more and more of a \"Global City\", in\r\n\r\nthe  words  of  one  of  the Ministers,  we  shall\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  the  importation  of  technological\r\n\r\nskills  and  expertise but at the  same  time  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  shall become more exposed and vulnerable\r\n\r\nto exploitation by international crooks who, under\r\n\r\nthe  guise of commerce, will come along with their\r\n\r\nhighly  refined  and subtle confidence-tricks.  We\r\n\r\ncannot   always  afford  to  learn   from   bitter\r\n\r\nexperience. In the course of the next few years  I\r\n\r\nshould  like  to see a rather more  effective  and\r\n\r\nknowledgeable commercial crime unit within our own\r\n\r\npolice  force working hand-in-hand with the  Trade\r\n\r\nDivision of the Ministry of Finance and constantly\r\n\r\nkeeping a watchful eye on imported crimes directed\r\n\r\nat taking away the precious savings of our people.\r\n\r\nIn  this connection, it is therefore reassuring to\r\n\r\nnote  from the addendum to the President's speech,\r\n\r\nthe proposed setting up of a Criminal Intelligence\r\n\r\nUnit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be failing in my duty if I did not\r\n\r\nbring  the attention of the House to some  of  the\r\n\r\nperennial problems faced by the rural folk. At the\r\n\r\ntop  of  the  list is, of course, the pig  problem\r\n\r\nwhich has been the subject of heated debate at the\r\n\r\nlast Parliament. Suffice it to say, I do sincerely\r\n\r\nhope  that  the Ministry concerned will study  the\r\n\r\nproblem  in depth with a view to finding permanent\r\n\r\nand suitable solutions at an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearlier date, leading to stability of price and at a\r\n\r\nlevel  tolerable to farmers who have suffered severe\r\n\r\nfinancial losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take the opportunity of\r\n\r\nrequesting the Minister for Law to direct  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice  to  carry out a revision of  the  conditions\r\n\r\nattached   to  all  temporary  occupation   licences\r\n\r\ngranted to people occupying State land in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  so that it would be easier and possible  for\r\n\r\nexisting  structures to be either  extended  or  new\r\n\r\nstructures   erected  in  order   to   meet   rising\r\n\r\nexpectations. At present most, if not all,  of  such\r\n\r\napplications  are  turned  down.  Consequently  many\r\n\r\nfamilies   have   to  put  up  with   very   crammed\r\n\r\nconditions,   since  alternative  accommodation   is\r\n\r\nbecoming increasingly difficult to come by,  bearing\r\n\r\nin  mind the long waiting list at the Housing Board.\r\n\r\nThe  very  involved procedures at present which  are\r\n\r\nnecessary in order to obtain approval for repairs or\r\n\r\nrenovations,  no  matter how  minor  the  nature  of\r\n\r\nrepairs may be, also leave much to be desired, and I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  that  something  be  done  to  simplify\r\n\r\nmatters and to avoid unnecessary delays. All in all,\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  the time has come for a  rather  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   set  of  policies  aiming   at   the\r\n\r\nbetterment of life in general in the rural areas  so\r\n\r\nthat, to quote the President, the bloom as reflected\r\n\r\nfrom  the glow of success \"will spread from the city\r\n\r\nto  the  new towns, and through to the villages  and\r\n\r\nkampongs in the rural areas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications (Mr Lim Guan Hoo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the motion, moved by the Member  for\r\n\r\nBukit  Batok, expressing our thanks to the President\r\n\r\nfor  the speech which he delivered on behalf of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  at the opening of the First  Session  of\r\n\r\nthis Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We meet today in a more favourable atmosphere with\r\n\r\na  homogeneous parliamentary line-up, fully equipped\r\n\r\nwith  the  determination to safeguard what  we  have\r\n\r\nachieved in the past 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears.  Far  from  being  annoyed  by  any  form  of\r\n\r\npolitical  instability,  we  are  now  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to enjoy a stable situation brought  about\r\n\r\nby  the  PAP's  achievement in  the  recent  general\r\n\r\nelections. Mr Speaker, Sir, if I recollect  rightly,\r\n\r\nnot  all  the countries in the world which claim  to\r\n\r\nhave  adopted a parliamentary democratic system have\r\n\r\nbenefited  from parliamentarism. One of the  reasons\r\n\r\nis that in many of these countries a defective multi-party   system  or  even  a  two-party   system   is\r\n\r\nencouraged to serve the purpose of those who  prefer\r\n\r\nconstitutional instability to the continuity  of  an\r\n\r\neffective government. Time and energy are wasted  in\r\n\r\nthe  intensified  inter-party struggles  which  lead\r\n\r\neventually  to unrest and disorder. In the  case  of\r\n\r\nthe  Third  Republic of France,  there  had  been  a\r\n\r\ncentury of constitutional instability. The real vice\r\n\r\nlies  in  the  belief that democracy should  provide\r\n\r\nmore  intensified inter-party struggles rather  than\r\n\r\npolitical stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore do not believe that a small nation\r\n\r\nlike   ours   should  allow  foreign  interests   to\r\n\r\nmanipulate our internal politics under the guise  of\r\n\r\nsupplementing or reorganising our democratic  system\r\n\r\nby  offering an opposition voice in this Parliament.\r\n\r\nDemocracy must be a national asset and there must be\r\n\r\nno  room  for  insurrection to be triggered  off  by\r\n\r\nforeign  nations. Members will recall that prior  to\r\n\r\nthe  general  elections in 1959, there was  a  well-known  case  of  a  decadent  Lim  Yew  Hock  regime\r\n\r\nreceiving  financial support from a certain  foreign\r\n\r\npower.  The history of bracketed tractable operation\r\n\r\nand  black operation designed by foreign powers  can\r\n\r\nbe  traced to as far back as the 1950s. It would  be\r\n\r\nnaive  for  us to believe that being an  independent\r\n\r\ncountry   today,  Singapore  would  be   free   from\r\n\r\npolitical intervention from outside. This is part of\r\n\r\nthe  hard facts of life which should always be borne\r\n\r\nin  mind  by  all those who do not lack a  sense  of\r\n\r\ncommitment to the nation. We have to rely mainly  on\r\n\r\nour determination to safeguard our national interest\r\n\r\nagainst   any  political  manipulation  by   outside\r\n\r\npowers. Too often we find people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossessing  love for the nation only  when  the  sun\r\n\r\nsmiles  upon them. But the patriot who stands  firm,\r\n\r\neven  when  the cruel winds of fate blast  upon  our\r\n\r\nshores  and  dark  clouds  loom  over  the  horizon,\r\n\r\ndeserves the gratitude of every man and woman in the\r\n\r\nnation.  Only  God and the devil can live  alone  in\r\n\r\nthis  world. As men, we must live together and  care\r\n\r\nfor  one  another. This is a prerequisite to nation-building, and our first task is to build up a  sense\r\n\r\nof  political  alertness and  to  develop  the  best\r\n\r\nqualities  of incorruptible integrity. This  is  the\r\n\r\nessence of statesmanship and political maturity. All\r\n\r\nthese  are  crucial and should be treated  with  the\r\n\r\nutmost sincerity. Since my colleague, the Member for\r\n\r\nStamford and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour, has quoted from a book entitled \"Art  of\r\n\r\nWar\"  by  Soon Tze yesterday, I would  now  like  to\r\n\r\nquote Lao Tze for the reference of Members:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When the highest type of men hear of Truth, they\r\n\r\nforthwith  practise it sedulously. When the  average\r\n\r\ntype  of  men  hear of Truth, they are  unimpressed.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  lowest type of men hear  of  Truth,  they\r\n\r\ngreatly deride it and simply laugh at it. Indeed, if\r\n\r\nthese men do not deride it, it is surely not Truth.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am confident Members will agree\r\n\r\nwith me if I say that nation-building is no laughing\r\n\r\nmatter. It is a matter that concerns life and death,\r\n\r\nand  it determines whether empires wax or wane,  and\r\n\r\nwhether states cleave asunder or coalesce. Our  duty\r\n\r\nas  Singaporeans is to provide and build a tradition\r\n\r\nof  unshakable will to serve the best  interests  of\r\n\r\nour  country  so  as to preserve the  continuity  of\r\n\r\npolitical stability in this part of the world. We do\r\n\r\nnot  believe  that  the  proposed  presence  of   an\r\n\r\nopposition  in  this House would  reflect  a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard   of  democracy  in  Singapore.   This   is\r\n\r\nespecially so when the benefits of having opposition\r\n\r\nparties  are  entwined  with those  of  the  foreign\r\n\r\npowers.  At  a time when foreign powers are  showing\r\n\r\ngreater   and   greater  interest  in  this   island\r\n\r\nRepublic, one can hardly believe that the opposition\r\n\r\nparties would be capable of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresisting   the  temptation  generated   from   such\r\n\r\nattractive sources. If opposition parties fall  prey\r\n\r\nto foreign political manipulation, the time would be\r\n\r\nripe for us to declare them the common enemy of  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore.  There  is  no  feeling   of\r\n\r\nindifference among our people on matters  concerning\r\n\r\nnational  survival. I therefore believe that  it  is\r\n\r\nnow  time  for a system to be established to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  will  of the people in respect  of  major\r\n\r\nissues  concerning their destiny is  well  expressed\r\n\r\nand  that  such  a  system will  always  remain  the\r\n\r\ndecisive   force   in   the  safeguarding   of   our\r\n\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion of the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nBatok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto support the motion, moved by the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nBatok,  expressing our thanks to the  President  for\r\n\r\nhis  speech delivered last Thursday on behalf of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  at the opening of the First  Session  of\r\n\r\nthis Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nEducation, it would not be out of place  for  me  to\r\n\r\ndwell for a few moments on education in general  and\r\n\r\non   our   educational  policies  in  Singapore   in\r\n\r\nparticular.  These arc matters of great  bearing  to\r\n\r\nthe continued progress of our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the system and content of\r\n\r\neducation in any country be shaped according to  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the country. In a changing social  order,\r\n\r\neducation should guide the citizens in their efforts\r\n\r\nto  build a new society. Young people must be taught\r\n\r\nto  adapt  themselves to the new social environment,\r\n\r\nand   this  should  be  the  responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That education and the pursuit of knowledge should\r\n\r\nnot be the monopoly of any privileged class needs no\r\n\r\nemphasis. Those who were not able, for one reason or\r\n\r\nanother,  to enjoy much education when young  should\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven the opportunity to pick it up again at a  more\r\n\r\nopportune   time   through   adult   education   and\r\n\r\nvocational  training programmes. At the  same  time,\r\n\r\nhowever,  the  people should not  be  encouraged  to\r\n\r\nclimb  the education ladder blindly, without  regard\r\n\r\nto  social needs. For example, if the country's need\r\n\r\nis for more people trained in practical skills, then\r\n\r\ncourses  offering  such  training  should  be  given\r\n\r\npriority  over those which are purely  academic  and\r\n\r\nnon-practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, as I see it within the context of\r\n\r\nSingapore, should be planned instruction,  beginning\r\n\r\nwith  the  young, to cultivate their  potentialities\r\n\r\nand  talents so as to enable them not only to engage\r\n\r\nin   productive  work  in  order  to  improve  their\r\n\r\neconomic   well-being   but   also   to   contribute\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  to the promotion of social  progress\r\n\r\nin the midst of a democratic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has in recent years undergone\r\n\r\ntransformation in every field -political, social and\r\n\r\neconomic.  And throughout this period of  purposeful\r\n\r\nferment, education has been the main strut upholding\r\n\r\nnational planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of our Republic's rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  the  aims  and  content  of  our\r\n\r\neducational  system were orientated towards  science\r\n\r\nand   technology.  Many  new  measures   have   been\r\n\r\nimplemented  by the Ministry of Education.  A  major\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of our secondary school  system  was\r\n\r\nstarted  in  1968, laying unprecedented emphasis  on\r\n\r\ntechnical  education. This was  necessary  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  the  state  of  industry  in  Singapore  could\r\n\r\nadvance.  Greater  stress  has  been  laid  on   the\r\n\r\nteaching   of  mathematics,  science  and  technical\r\n\r\nsubjects  in  our technical schools  and  vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes.  We  have been encouraging  the  use  of\r\n\r\nEnglish  in  teaching  science  and  mathematics  at\r\n\r\nsecondary and even at primary levels in non-English-medium  streams. This is necessary in our  long-term\r\n\r\ninterests  for we believe that the English  Language\r\n\r\ncan  provide  functional support to  our  plans  for\r\n\r\nscientific  and  technological  development  in  the\r\n\r\n`80s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in attaching importance to such\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  we  shall not forget  that  our  young\r\n\r\ncitizens must be encouraged to retain their cultural\r\n\r\nballast,  in  order  that  they  may  derive  enough\r\n\r\nconfidence  from a knowledge of their  own  cultural\r\n\r\nidentity to counter any ills and problems which  the\r\n\r\npace   of  life  in  an  industrialised  and  highly\r\n\r\nurbanised society may bring.

It is our aim  that\r\n\r\neducation  should  equip our young Singaporeans  for\r\n\r\nthe  task  of  turning Singapore  not  only  into  a\r\n\r\nregional  centre  for  industries  and  services  in\r\n\r\nshipping  and communications, banking and  commerce,\r\n\r\nbut also into a city of grace and vitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nachievements  of  the Government in  the  last  five\r\n\r\nyears  can  be  attributed mainly to the  sound  and\r\n\r\ndedicated  leadership  on  the  one  hand  and   the\r\n\r\ncooperation of our diligent people on the other.  We\r\n\r\nhave  mopped up unemployment, generated jobs,  built\r\n\r\nflats,  new  towns,  factories, etc.  These  can  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as tangible achievements. The tasks  ahead\r\n\r\nof  us  with emphasis on \"quality\" are more  complex\r\n\r\nand intangible than some of us would have realised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve quality in jobs, homes, social and\r\n\r\nrecreational  amenities, we require much  more  than\r\n\r\njust  more  money to be spent on capital  equipment,\r\n\r\nprolonged  training of technicians, and on educating\r\n\r\nthe professionals whose expertise is part and parcel\r\n\r\nof an industrial society. It requires greater effort\r\n\r\non  research and planning before action in order  to\r\n\r\nattain qualitative goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is needless for me to stress that the main\r\n\r\nefforts of our Government have been directed towards\r\n\r\nimproving the lot of every citizen of Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nhave  very little space in this island state and  we\r\n\r\nhave  hardly  any natural resources  worth  speaking\r\n\r\nabout.  It is precisely for this reason that I  feel\r\n\r\nthat there is an urgent need for the formulation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   a  comprehensive  socio-economic   and\r\n\r\nphysical development plan whose framework should  be\r\n\r\nflexible but clear enough to guide our long term and\r\n\r\nshort  term  investment decisions, and to  help  put\r\n\r\nevery  square  foot of space in this island  to  its\r\n\r\nbest possible use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only through comprehensive planning and\r\n\r\nthorough    research   will   we   achieve    better\r\n\r\ncommunication and transportation, better  places  of\r\n\r\nwork,  better community facilities and amenities,  a\r\n\r\nbetter  Singapore  for  our  children  and  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren's children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection I feel that particular\r\n\r\nattention  should be given to the development  of  a\r\n\r\nmore    effective   working   relationship   between\r\n\r\nGovernment departments and statutory bodies. At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, in order to achieve higher standards  in\r\n\r\neverything,  as  the President  has  stated,  it  is\r\n\r\nessential  also  to  cultivate  simultaneously   the\r\n\r\nquality  of our people and hopefully to be  able  to\r\n\r\nnurture  and  develop a broad base  of  intellectual\r\n\r\nfreemasons whose conviction and passionate  interest\r\n\r\nin  social responsibility stand in harmony with that\r\n\r\nof the sound and dedicated leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full well do we realise that in order to attain\r\n\r\nthe  ultimate goal it is imperative that the leaders\r\n\r\nshould  do the thinking, commanding, and carry  most\r\n\r\nof the responsibilities. But in the pursuit of these\r\n\r\nqualitative  goals,  it  is  preferable   that   the\r\n\r\nleadership  have  the support and  collaboration  of\r\n\r\nlike-minded beings than the need to drive or  spoon-feed all the way those who are led.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that there are simple solutions\r\n\r\nto  the  complex and intangible tasks ahead  of  us.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  needed  is greater team  work  inside  and\r\n\r\noutside this House. It is only through team work and\r\n\r\ncloser collaboration that effective plans evolve and\r\n\r\nhigher standards in everything achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit Batok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Encik Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, I wish to associate myself with the Member for Bukit Batok  in  moving a motion to express our thanks  to\r\n\r\nthe  President for the speech which he delivered  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Government at the opening of the First\r\n\r\nSession  of  the Third Parliament on  12th  October,\r\n\r\n1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has outlined some guidelines for\r\n\r\nSingapore. When translated into practical terms,  it\r\n\r\nwill  mean  a better life for the mostest number  of\r\n\r\npeople  at  the  expense of marginal  sacrifices  by\r\n\r\nthose  able  to  bear  them.  Living  conditions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  already been kept stable  and  non-inflationary since 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The developed nations have not fared well in this\r\n\r\nrespect. There, galloping inflation is the order  of\r\n\r\nthe  day.  Irresponsible trade unionism  is  another\r\n\r\nmenace, so much so that one wag says that the unions\r\n\r\nmay   succeed   in  abolishing  the   working   week\r\n\r\naltogether. In those countries, the status  quo  has\r\n\r\nbeen defined as the mess they are in, which includes\r\n\r\npollution  and  all the rest of it. It  is  easy  to\r\n\r\nunderstand that the soil there is conducive  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  hippi-ism  and  other   hedonistic\r\n\r\nphilosophies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have travelled abroad find the contrast\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and other societies evident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the developing societies, they will find that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  economic take-off simply because  the\r\n\r\ngovernments and the people do not pull together  and\r\n\r\nmake  the  necessary sacrifices. Many  a  developing\r\n\r\nsociety  is left far behind in the race for economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, nobody starves if he is able-bodied\r\n\r\nand  prepared to accept any job offered, even if  he\r\n\r\nis  unskilled. It means that the correct formula for\r\n\r\nnation-building has been found by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cornerstone of nation-building is a realistic\r\n\r\npolicy of \"from each his best, to each according  to\r\n\r\nhis ability\". This means that whether in business or\r\n\r\nin  the Government services, each man finds his  way\r\n\r\nto the room at the top only on his own merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans will have to continue to be economic\r\n\r\nanimals.  In fact, any halt to Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment will be a national catastrophe. But from\r\n\r\ntime to time there have been pleas that we be not an\r\n\r\nugly  society  of  people  who  know  the  price  of\r\n\r\neverything but the value of nothing. It simply means\r\n\r\nthat  dollar-worship should be matched by  aesthetic\r\n\r\nappreciation.  It is good for Singaporeans  to  make\r\n\r\nmoney,  but  in  doing  so, they  must  advance  the\r\n\r\nnational  interest  and, better still,  cultivate  a\r\n\r\nlove   for   arts.  This  way,  we   become   better\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stress on the appreciation of arts and beauty\r\n\r\nis  timely. This is the best time for such a clarion\r\n\r\ncall to be made. It would have been premature if the\r\n\r\ncall  was  made  in our earlier period  of  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Now that we are sharing the  fruits  of\r\n\r\nnational  development,  we  should  apply  ourselves\r\n\r\nseriously  to the arts, since most of us can  afford\r\n\r\nit.  And  if at such a time we should fail to  place\r\n\r\nthe right emphasis on cultural development, then  we\r\n\r\nare  to  blame  if  ours becomes a gross  and  crude\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has said that Singapore's limited\r\n\r\nland  resources means that \"we cannot seek fame  for\r\n\r\nsheer  size\".  But we can be synonymous  with  human\r\n\r\nexcellence. This means, among other things, that  we\r\n\r\ncan   be   world-known  as  a  society  of  cultural\r\n\r\nrefinement. We can achieve this because  we  possess\r\n\r\nthe cultural resources of all the major races on the\r\n\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other related point I wish to make is the\r\n\r\nnecessity to work hard in the national interest.  So\r\n\r\nlong  as the economy is kept buoyant, our prosperity\r\n\r\nis  assured,  not forgetting the need  for  national\r\n\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have an unfavourable man-land ratio, we\r\n\r\nhave  to plan the use of every inch of this resource\r\n\r\nvery  carefully.  We  have to  compensate  for  this\r\n\r\nunfavourable  man-land ratio by acquisition  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  interest  -  in  other  words,  land   not\r\n\r\neconomically used is acquired for public projects to\r\n\r\nbenefit  a  thousand times the number of people  who\r\n\r\nhave to move out. Dislocation is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncaused to the affected few. But there should  be  no\r\n\r\nhard  feelings if those affected understand that  if\r\n\r\nSingapore were 10 or 20 times its present size, such\r\n\r\ndislocation would not be necessary. Yet unscrupulous\r\n\r\npoliticians  told those affected that  should  their\r\n\r\nparties  be  elected and come to power, these  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  or redevelopment projects would be reversed\r\n\r\nor  halted.  Certain political parties in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not hesitate to set back the clock of national\r\n\r\nprogress in their efforts to win votes. This is very\r\n\r\nsad  for  them because the concept of an alternative\r\n\r\ngovernment  with a two-party system means  that  the\r\n\r\nalternative  programme must be  as  progressive  and\r\n\r\nconstructive, if not more so, as the ruling party's,\r\n\r\nif  they  are  to have any prospects  at  a  general\r\n\r\nelection.  However, their empty  promises  did  have\r\n\r\nsome  effect during the last general elections.  The\r\n\r\nelectorate  in Singapore must be taught to  be  more\r\n\r\ncritical and analytic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the last general elections has\r\n\r\ndemonstrated beyond any shadow of doubt  that  there\r\n\r\nare  still  those  in Singapore, be  they  political\r\n\r\nparties  or individuals, who would seek to  come  to\r\n\r\npower not for the benefit of the people as such, but\r\n\r\nfor  their  own benefits, irrespective of what  harm\r\n\r\ntheir policies would do to our Republic. We, on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, are a party which have come up  against\r\n\r\nmany  problems in the past, introduced many  crucial\r\n\r\nadaptations  and  changes which  have  to  be  made,\r\n\r\nunpopular as they might have been to some people. In\r\n\r\nspite   of   the   prophets  of   doom,   who   have\r\n\r\nunsuccessfully tried their best to discourage us  in\r\n\r\nour  endeavours, we intend to continue to  face  and\r\n\r\novercome whatever obstacles that come our way in the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Unlike those who make' promises at election\r\n\r\ntime   and   then,  not  being  elected,   disappear\r\n\r\ncompletely from the scene without any more  interest\r\n\r\nin  the people whom they pretend to stand for and to\r\n\r\nlook  after, we plan many years ahead and anticipate\r\n\r\nor  try  to anticipate the changing scenes  and  the\r\n\r\nmany  problems which come within the orbit not  only\r\n\r\nof Singapore but of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  other countries as well. As a nation  of  doers\r\n\r\nand not criers, we always gear ourselves to meet the\r\n\r\nchallenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned with the problems of nation\r\n\r\nbuilding  which, as the Member for Bukit  Merah  has\r\n\r\nrightly   said,  should  be  treated   with   utmost\r\n\r\nsincerity  as  they  are  affected  by  the  various\r\n\r\naspects  of  culture. Mass media is a most  powerful\r\n\r\nweapon,  and my Ministry intends to see that  it  is\r\n\r\nused  to unify and consolidate the building  of  our\r\n\r\nnation  with  the  right aims and attitudes  towards\r\n\r\npeace  and progress. The various aspects of cultural\r\n\r\nand  social activities which come within the purview\r\n\r\nof  my  Ministry are directed and channelled towards\r\n\r\nthe   building   of  character  of   our   citizens,\r\n\r\nespecially our youths, so that not only will they be\r\n\r\nhard-working and achievement-oriented but they  will\r\n\r\nalso  be mentally active and loyal citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic,  able  to appreciate things  of  aesthetic\r\n\r\nvalue  and  are  always  intellectually  alive   and\r\n\r\nresponsive  to changes which take place  beyond  our\r\n\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the opening\r\n\r\nAddress  to  Parliament  by our  President  on  12th\r\n\r\nOctober in this House is a very significant one. The\r\n\r\nspeech outlined plans for Singapore and the problems\r\n\r\nwe  have faced and may face in the next five years.\r\n\r\nThe  contents of the speech are worth noting for the\r\n\r\ndown-to-earth  treatment  of  our  problems  we  are\r\n\r\nfacing, instead of presenting a speech with a glossy\r\n\r\nsurface as is the case with some other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the elections in 1968 we were faced with a\r\n\r\nvery  grave problem. The British in their  desperate\r\n\r\nefforts to salvage a sinking economy, which  was  on\r\n\r\nthe  verge  of  bankruptcy, had  dealt  Singapore  a\r\n\r\nterrible  blow.  Their  announcement  of  an   early\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  their troops would  have  spelt  the\r\n\r\ndeath   knell  for  many  countries,  but  not   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  because  of  the kind  of  citizens  that\r\n\r\nSingapore   possesses.  Fortunately   we   have   an\r\n\r\nefficient government whose foresight has saved Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  a time. The Government has again  proved\r\n\r\nits  worth  and calibre. Under the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nmagnificent    leadership,   together    with    the\r\n\r\nresourcefulness  and  hardworking  nature   of   the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  we have instead proved  the  doomsday\r\n\r\nprophets wrong once again. Nowhere in Asia,  besides\r\n\r\nJapan,  is  there a country experiencing  such  boom\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to experience these boom conditions\r\n\r\nfurther,  we have to employ a great number  of  non-citizens from abroad. I might mention at this  stage\r\n\r\nthat, although work permits are issued liberally for\r\n\r\nmost  categories of workers, we still find factories\r\n\r\nemploying   workers  without  work  permits.   These\r\n\r\nworkers  had  their applications  for  work  permits\r\n\r\nrejected  by  the  officials  responsible,  on  some\r\n\r\nflimsy  grounds. It is high time that  work  permits\r\n\r\nwere   issued  to  workers,  particularly  to  those\r\n\r\nemployed  in factories, as they are being  exploited\r\n\r\nby  their employers. Further, these workers  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  any  CPF contributions made to them; thus  the\r\n\r\ncountry and the workers are losing money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the subject of visas, may I point out\r\n\r\nthat  the office responsible for the issue of  visas\r\n\r\nseems to have a particular prejudice against members\r\n\r\nof  the  religious  orders. Quite  often  they  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in the renewal of their visas.  To  make\r\n\r\nmatters  worse,  new applications  are  quite  often\r\n\r\nrejected. Since Singaporeans are more interested  in\r\n\r\nthe  materialistic world which they  are  surrounded\r\n\r\nwith, only a few join the religious orders. There is\r\n\r\ngreat  difficulty  among  the  religious  orders  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  the services, institutions  and  homes,\r\n\r\nwhich  they  have admirably maintained for  so  many\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's speech, however, has failed to\r\n\r\nmention  the problems faced by the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics in this case are very deceiving. Since\r\n\r\nthe  PSA  raised their tariffs late last year,  many\r\n\r\nvessels have avoided coming to the docks in order to\r\n\r\navoid  paying  the very high charges. Statistically,\r\n\r\nduring the first half of this year as compared  with\r\n\r\nthat of last year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is a greater turn-round of ships and  greater\r\n\r\nhandling of cargo. But one most important thing  has\r\n\r\nbeen  covered up by these statistics issued  by  the\r\n\r\nPSA;  and that is, there is a great volume of  cargo\r\n\r\nbeing  handled at the roads, for which  the  PSA  is\r\n\r\nlosing  money. These ships at the roads avoid paying\r\n\r\nthe  many  charges  involved, if  they  had  docked.\r\n\r\nThereby Singapore is losing a great deal of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for some sort of remedial action\r\n\r\nto be taken to alleviate this abnormal situation. In\r\n\r\nthe  long run more and more shipping companies would\r\n\r\nbe  wise to the game and would discharge their cargo\r\n\r\nin  the  roads instead. This is not a good omen  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Either the tariffs are lowered  or  some\r\n\r\nother  means  have to be adopted to bring  back  the\r\n\r\n\"lost\"  ships.  Just because we  are  enjoying  boom\r\n\r\nconditions in other sectors, it does not  mean  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  neglect  or gloss  over  the  statistics\r\n\r\nissued  by  the PSA. Otherwise one of our  important\r\n\r\nsources of income may dry up through neglect  and  a\r\n\r\nfalse picture created by statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time may I also bring to the attention of\r\n\r\nthe  Government the plight of the lower income group\r\n\r\nin  the civil service. With the cost of living going\r\n\r\nup,  these  workers  are  the  ones  who  are  being\r\n\r\nneglected, and they are finding it extremely hard to\r\n\r\nstretch the dollar. It is time that review of  their\r\n\r\nsalary  structures  be  considered  immediately.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is going to be a wage revision, may 1 suggest\r\n\r\nthat  the  lower  income group workers  be  given  a\r\n\r\nhigher  percentage of the increase  as  against  the\r\n\r\nincrease for the higher Division officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the civil service and in the statutory boards\r\n\r\nit is the officer with the proper qualifications who\r\n\r\ngets   the   promotion  and  not  the  person   with\r\n\r\ncapabilities. A person with a University degree  can\r\n\r\nbe assured of a promotion when competing with a non-graduate  for  a  certain post,  although  the  non-graduate\r\n\r\nmay  be more experienced and  quite  often\r\n\r\nmore  capable  than  the graduate.  This  system  of\r\n\r\ngiving  University graduates preferential  treatment\r\n\r\nin everything has thus produced a dis-satisfied \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncivil service, particularly in the case of\r\n\r\nthe  non-graduate  who is a very capable  person.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that it is important for it to be well\r\n\r\nknown generally that, in theory and in practice,  it\r\n\r\nis  possible for meritorious officers to be promoted\r\n\r\nto  higher grades, even though they may not have the\r\n\r\neducational  qualifications  normally  required  for\r\n\r\ndirect  entry into the grade, provided  always  that\r\n\r\nthey  are in all respects capable of performing  the\r\n\r\nduties  of  the higher grade. Therefore, the  stress\r\n\r\nshould  be laid on performance and potential  rather\r\n\r\nthan  on formal qualifications. There should  always\r\n\r\nbe   promotional  opportunities  open   to   serving\r\n\r\nofficers capable of high performance. Therefore,  at\r\n\r\nall  levels of the service a number of vacancies  in\r\n\r\nthe  recruitment grades should be made available for\r\n\r\nin-service promotion for such officers. It  is  also\r\n\r\nimportant that an officer should benefit immediately\r\n\r\non  promotion  and  that  the  promotional  increase\r\n\r\nshould  he a meaningful one, i.e., it should  be  an\r\n\r\namount   representing  not  less  than  one   normal\r\n\r\nincrement on the salary scale of the post  to  which\r\n\r\nthe officer is promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scheme should also he framed to give more than\r\n\r\none annual increment to officers as an incentive  to\r\n\r\nofficers  for  their exceptionally good  performance\r\n\r\nduring the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in respect of the rising cost of living,\r\n\r\npensioners   who   had   retired   prior   to    the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  consolidated  salaries   -   not\r\n\r\nmyself, there are others- should have their pensions\r\n\r\ncomputed  to the equivalent of the consolidation  in\r\n\r\norder to keep up with the times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this term of Parliament saw the\r\n\r\nintroduction of a new Ministry. The Ministry of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment was formed at a very apt moment.  It  is\r\n\r\nworth  noting  that the Ministry has many  important\r\n\r\nresponsibilities under its care.  A  few  years  ago\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  smog  in  Japan,  which  considerably\r\n\r\nhindered  its economic performance. This was  mainly\r\n\r\ndue  to  too many industries operating at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  thus  causing serious air pollution.  I  also\r\n\r\nunderstand that in Los Angeles, USA,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in Fleet Street in London there are times  when\r\n\r\nthe  public  are  advised not  to  do  any  physical\r\n\r\nexercise! This is due to the existence of  bad  air.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Singapore has recently taken precautionary\r\n\r\nmeasures  such  as the establishment  of  the  Anti-Pollution  Unit  and  other  measures  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nenvironment free from this menace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few weeks we noticed a haze now\r\n\r\nand  again  appearing in our country. Never  in  the\r\n\r\nhistory of Singapore, other than this moment, did we\r\n\r\ncome  across  haze.  Though  the  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  has  given words  of  consolation  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason for any alarm, nevertheless  in\r\n\r\nthe long-term interest it is important to the public\r\n\r\nthat  the  air is kept safe. Steps must be taken  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the people will not be infected by  any\r\n\r\nform of sickness caused by this mysterious haze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion moved by the\r\n\r\nMember for Bukit Batok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chin, you shall be the last speaker\r\n\r\nfor the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I would like to thank the  President\r\n\r\nfor  his Address to Parliament on the opening of the\r\n\r\nFirst  Session of this Parliament. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nstress  on  two points here. The first is about  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  amendment and the  second  is  about\r\n\r\nenvironmental  health. These two problems  are  very\r\n\r\nclosely  related  to the lives  and  safety  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President pointed out that\r\n\r\nour  Constitution will be amended to provide  for  a\r\n\r\nminimum  of  two-thirds  majority  in  a  referendum\r\n\r\nbefore Singapore could form a federation or could be\r\n\r\nmerged  with  another country. This is a  very  wise\r\n\r\nproposal.  The  people of Singapore know  very  well\r\n\r\nthat  since  independence the  developments  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry   have  received  the  admiration  of   many\r\n\r\ncountries. Our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  has  made  great  progress  - from  economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties   to   the   threshold   of    economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  These achievements have not  descended\r\n\r\nupon  us  from heaven. These achievements have  been\r\n\r\nmade possible by the great effort and dedication  of\r\n\r\nour people. We must preserve the precious fruits  of\r\n\r\nour  success. We must not allow other people through\r\n\r\nany  process to take away the fruits of our success.\r\n\r\nThe  Constitutional  amendment will  strengthen  the\r\n\r\nsovereignty  of  our  country.  This  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary  at the present juncture. I am  wholly  in\r\n\r\nsupport of this proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the Speech of the President,\r\n\r\nit  can be seen that in many respects the Government\r\n\r\nis  looking after the livelihood of the people  very\r\n\r\nwell. The Government is set to raise the standard of\r\n\r\nliving  of our people. This can be seen through  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the Ministry of the  Environment.\r\n\r\nThis  shows  the determination of the Government  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect.  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  following  active\r\n\r\neconomic development, more and more industries  have\r\n\r\nbeen   established.  The  problem  of  environmental\r\n\r\nhealth  then becomes more and more serious. In  many\r\n\r\nadvanced  cities  like  Tokyo  and  New  York,   air\r\n\r\npollution  has become an insurmountable problem.  It\r\n\r\nhas affected the lives and safety of the people.  In\r\n\r\nthe last few years, air pollution tended to increase\r\n\r\nbecause of the rapid industrialisation in Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result of economic progress, there  are  more\r\n\r\nvehicles  on  the roads, more radio  and  television\r\n\r\nsets   in  Singapore,  contributing  to  more  noise\r\n\r\npollution   which   will   gradually   affect    the\r\n\r\ntranquility  and  health of our living  environment.\r\n\r\nBefore  these  can seriously affect our  living  and\r\n\r\nsafety,  the  establishment of the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  now is a far-sighted and a very  timely\r\n\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think adopting legal measures alone is not\r\n\r\nsufficient to combat pollution. This matter must  be\r\n\r\nthe  concern of everyone in Singapore.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  introduce concrete and comprehensive\r\n\r\nproposals   to  improve  environmental   health   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Besides the Ministry of  Culture,  which\r\n\r\nshould do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits   best   to   disseminate  the   importance   of\r\n\r\nenvironmental health, and the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nwhich  must impart its importance to all our  school\r\n\r\nchildren, everybody must voluntarily respond to  the\r\n\r\ncall  for  environmental health. Civic organisations\r\n\r\nshould   systematically  and  periodically  organise\r\n\r\ncampaigns  to  preserve  our  environmental  health.\r\n\r\nVehicles  should  be  regularly  serviced  and  they\r\n\r\nshould  use anti-pollution devices. Industries  must\r\n\r\nplay  their part in preventing pollution by adopting\r\n\r\nsuitable measures and methods and to avoid pollution-causing processes. We must at all cost preserve  the\r\n\r\ncleanliness  and  wholesomeness  of   the   air   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Hawkers must also do their bit to prevent\r\n\r\nthe  pollution  of  the environment  and  the  water\r\n\r\nsource.  Sir,  I  must stress that  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nenvironmental health can be solved only when we  all\r\n\r\ncan  see that it is directly related to our standard\r\n\r\nof  living and national safety and when we  all  can\r\n\r\nactively  and  voluntarily  adopt  early  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures.  How to make our people realise the  close\r\n\r\nrelationship  this problem bears to us  and  how  to\r\n\r\nthoroughly  solve it, I think, depend on the  effort\r\n\r\nof all our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
