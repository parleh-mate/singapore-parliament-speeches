The main point that I put across was that  the\r\n\r\ntimeliness  and  accuracy of information for decision-making  is\r\n\r\nextremely  important in this fast-changing world.  And  this  is\r\n\r\neven  so in the preparation of a nation's Budget.  I touched  on\r\n\r\nthe  increasingly  alarming reports of the  banks'  exposure  to\r\n\r\nregional  economies.   Malaysian  banks  also  sustained   heavy\r\n\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks like events are unfolding faster\r\n\r\nthan  information  can be gathered, analysed  and  disseminated.\r\n\r\nYesterday, we got the financial results of UOB.  The figure  for\r\n\r\ntheir  classified loans for regional economies is $332  million,\r\n\r\nout  of  the total classified loans of the bank of $991 million.\r\n\r\nSince  this  is  the  first  time  the  bank  has  made  such  a\r\n\r\ndisclosure,  there  was  no historical data  with  which  I  can\r\n\r\ncompare  and  get the year-to-year difference.  But  it  may  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  surmise  that the difference  between  the  $991\r\n\r\nmillion  and $332 million, as just mentioned, was due  to  local\r\n\r\nloans,  and  the difference is about $660 million.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, $660 million classified local loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar analysis of DBS Bank gives us a figure of $735\r\n\r\nmillion for classified local loans.  With just these two  banks,\r\n\r\nthe  combined figure is a staggering $1.4 billion.   I  wish  to\r\n\r\nhighlight here that the $1.4 billion for the two banks  must  be\r\n\r\ntelling  us  that  there are many local enterprises  who  cannot\r\n\r\nservice their loans any more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure will be bigger if we combine the results of all\r\n\r\nthe  big four, Hong Kong Bank, Standard Chartered, Citibank  and\r\n\r\nother  banks that lend to our companies.  Further analysis shows\r\n\r\nthat  for  UOB, the $332 million classified loan is out  of  the\r\n\r\n19.7%  of  total loans, and $660 million is out of  the  80%  of\r\n\r\ntotal loans.  I may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurmise  that  the total loans' current status is only  half  as\r\n\r\ngood as those compared to regional loans.  And my guess here  is\r\n\r\nconsistent  with the survey results of the various  associations\r\n\r\nthat  our local companies are not doing well.  I hence  call  on\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  get  the banks to make  quarterly  reports,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  half-yearly reports, to increase  transparency  and\r\n\r\nmarket   efficiency,  and  to  work  more   closely   with   the\r\n\r\nassociations to feel the pulse and the health of our companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having cited these figures, I am concerned that the\r\n\r\nproposed Budget is not meeting the needs of the current economic\r\n\r\nsituation.  The market has reacted so.  If the Government is not\r\n\r\nreacting  fast  enough, would we get into deeper  trouble  which\r\n\r\nwill  cost  us more to get out?  The slow reaction  of  Japanese\r\n\r\nFinance Ministry's officials to their country's economic problem\r\n\r\nand  Japan's slow recovery has presented to us vividly a classic\r\n\r\nexample  of  why lagging and conservative policies  may  not  be\r\n\r\nideal after all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I called on the Finance Minister to have a more\r\n\r\nexpansionary  Budget.   I urge the Minister  not  to  allow  the\r\n\r\ncurrent   economic   difficulties  to  deflect   our   long-term\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  development plans and, hopefully,  it  will  not\r\n\r\naffect  the  construction of underground road  systems  and  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  needed  to  push  our vital  economic  sectors.   As\r\n\r\ndemonstrated by the first phase of our MRT project, kicking  off\r\n\r\nbig  infrastructure projects during an economic downturn enables\r\n\r\nus  to  construct these facilities at bargain prices.  We should\r\n\r\ncapitalise  on the current situation by building more  MRTs  and\r\n\r\nLRTs because construction costs are low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another note, I would like to focus on one point which\r\n\r\nis  related to private equity funds.  Although there are now tax\r\n\r\nincentives  for this industry, there is still no clear  strategy\r\n\r\nby  the  Government  to develop a vibrant  private  equity  fund\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the Finance Ministry has given incentives for\r\n\r\ndeveloping  Singapore into Asia's premier fund  management  hub.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to basically focus on promoting Singapore as a  centre\r\n\r\nfor  managing Asian marketable securities investment  portfolios\r\n\r\nof  both  Asian  and  Western clients, and for  managing  global\r\n\r\nmarketable   securities   for   clients.    However,    specific\r\n\r\ninitiatives for developing Singapore as a hub for private equity\r\n\r\nfund  management  industry seem to  be  one  thing  in  the  new\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector policy announcement.  In this  connection,  we\r\n\r\nshould note that the private equity fund management industry  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is much less robust than in Hong Kong.  There are much\r\n\r\nmore new equity funds founded there every year.  More funds  are\r\n\r\nunder  management  and  more  fund  management  companies   have\r\n\r\nheadquarters  in  Hong Kong than in Singapore.   Singapore  only\r\n\r\ncaptures  a  very  small fraction of the  private  equity  funds\r\n\r\ninvesting  in  the  region, although we are  strategically  well\r\n\r\nlocated for such regional funds targeting for investment in  the\r\n\r\nASEAN countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, what plans does the Finance Ministry have\r\n\r\nfor  the private equity fund management industry?  What are  the\r\n\r\nstrategies in attracting more internationally reputable  private\r\n\r\nequity  fund  managers or groups to establish their headquarters\r\n\r\nhere?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, many local enterprises are cash-squeezed, and news has\r\n\r\nit  that Malaysian, Thai and Indonesian private companies are in\r\n\r\ndire  need for capital injection.  It is clear that this  is  an\r\n\r\nopportune  time  for Singapore to encourage more private  equity\r\n\r\nfunds,   big   or  small,  foreign  or  local,  to  have   their\r\n\r\nheadquarters  in  Singapore, so that  there  is  rapid  matching\r\n\r\nbetween  private companies in need of funds and  those  who  are\r\n\r\nwilling  to invest in them.  Note that private equity funds  not\r\n\r\nonly have the advantage of not being able to make massive, rapid\r\n\r\npull-out, compared to those involving marketable securities,  it\r\n\r\nalso fuels growth for many start-ups, as everybody has witnessed\r\n\r\nin  Silicon  Valley in the USA.  This will be  a  big  boost  to\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and  is also consistent with  Singapore's  on-going strategy for regionalisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, it may sound as if I am supporting the financial\r\n\r\nsector  only.   But  actually a vibrant dynamic  private  equity\r\n\r\nindustry  would  benefit our SMEs more than just  the  financial\r\n\r\nmarket.  And this brings me to the next point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is constant complaint among our SMEs that the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policies, though pro-business, have always been pro-MNC and pro-GLC only.  EDB is the main Government body in charge\r\n\r\nof  the promotion of SMEs and bringing our SMEs to the vision of\r\n\r\nSingapore 21.  Yet there is no clear strategy outlined  in  this\r\n\r\nBudget  regarding  this.  It may be an opportune  time  for  the\r\n\r\nHouse  to consider the reorganisation of EDB so that fresh ideas\r\n\r\nand  new directions can be injected to promote SMEs to cater  to\r\n\r\nthe new possibilities in the fast-changing global economy.  This\r\n\r\nrejuvenating effort can only be good for the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Inderjit Singh said that Taiwan has weathered\r\n\r\nthis  crisis better than others because they have a  strong  SME\r\n\r\neconomy.  And I hope the Government will take a serious look  at\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last area I would like to touch is that I notice from\r\n\r\nthis  proposed  Budget  that no major  amount  is  allotted  for\r\n\r\nmanpower  training.   And  this is strange  because  many,  many\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House have repeatedly emphasised the importance\r\n\r\nof  retraining policy, and there was even talk about  tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation   on  training.   Here,  I  call  on  the   relevant\r\n\r\nMinistries  to  focus more on the specific plans  to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntraining  to  avoid  structural unemployment  as  seen  in  many\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the setting up of the Ministry of Manpower, I believe\r\n\r\nthe  policy of manpower training will be more comprehensive  and\r\n\r\neffective.  Accordingly, more funding should be provided  as  an\r\n\r\noff-Budget  measure.  Mr Speaker, Sir, it was reported  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  not  too  long  ago  that there are  700,000  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who have had only up to secondary two education.   If\r\n\r\nwe  were  to train 5% of them per year, namely, 35,000  workers,\r\n\r\nand it costs $2,000 per worker,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  will need $75 million in total per year.  And that is a very\r\n\r\nslow retraining process, because at 5% per year, it will take us\r\n\r\n20  years to retrain all our workers and many of whom would have\r\n\r\nretired  by then.  So I suggest that budget for training  should\r\n\r\nbe  in the region of $100 million to $200 million so that we can\r\n\r\ncover 10-15% of the workforce per year.  And I believe this will\r\n\r\nbe  more beneficial to the economy than the $130 million  rebate\r\n\r\nin  property  tax given to a handful of developers,  as  rightly\r\n\r\npointed out by Dr Lee Tsao Yuan yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I believe that the Government should have their\r\n\r\noperation orders ready to avert a developing crisis, rather than\r\n\r\nwait  for  an  emergency  before thinking  of  remedial  action.\r\n\r\nThrough  off-Budget  measures,  the  Government  can  take   the\r\n\r\ndriver's seat in introducing more infrastructure projects,  more\r\n\r\nmanpower  training,  encouraging  more  private  equity   funds,\r\n\r\nworking more closely with SMEs, so that we can get the buzz into\r\n\r\nour  economy, as what our Senior Minister has judiciously called\r\n\r\nfor.   Perhaps then, the people may be better helped in  getting\r\n\r\nprepared to weather this crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): First, I\r\n\r\nwould like to indicate my support for the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the media reports, we can generally\r\n\r\nsee  that many in Singapore have expressed disappointment   over\r\n\r\nthis  year's  Budget.  Some business people have  expressed  the\r\n\r\nview  that they are completely lost as to why there are no  off-Budget  measures as announced by the Minister.   The  small  and\r\n\r\nmedium-sized  businesses  are  even  more  so  in   this   case.\r\n\r\nGenerally, people feel that the Government must be more positive\r\n\r\nin  helping  the economy, the businessmen and to  stimulate  our\r\n\r\neconomy  so as to enable us to tide over the storm in Singapore.\r\n\r\nRight  now,  we  are very disheartened about the effect  brought\r\n\r\nabout  by  the economic turmoil and it is quite reasonable  that\r\n\r\nthe  business  people expect the Government to  announce  rescue\r\n\r\npackages and measures for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Leong Horn Kee that the Government must pay\r\n\r\ncloser  attention to the current developments  and  should  work\r\n\r\ntogether  with the local organisations in business and  industry\r\n\r\nto  maintain a continual dialogue with them.  I hope that, if it\r\n\r\nis  possible, the Government should immediately set up a Special\r\n\r\nCommittee,  a Special Task Force, to prepare for the rainy  day.\r\n\r\nThis  Task Force or Special Committee should aim at helping  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to provide views and collective wisdom,  to  collect\r\n\r\nfeedback  so that Singapore and the country can go through  this\r\n\r\nstorm.   The members of this Committee should be representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Manpower  Ministry,  Ministry  of  Finance,  MTI  and\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of private sector organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from increasing the tax cut for\r\n\r\nincome  tax  and  interest tax, etc, I hope that the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  help  those first-time buyers of properties to  give  them\r\n\r\nspecial   attention  because  these  people  who    bought   the\r\n\r\nproperties  for the first time normally have financial  problem.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, they do not have adequate cash upfront  to  pay\r\n\r\nfor the properties.  So I do not know whether the Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to consider allowing such people to make use of  their\r\n\r\nCPF  money  to pay for the first downpayment of 20%.   Then  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  benefit will not be the first time property  buyers\r\n\r\nbut  also  others as well.  At the same time, I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  will  allow the  business  community  to\r\n\r\nunderstand why there is so much prudence in the present  Budget.\r\n\r\nMany members of the business community feel that, as compared to\r\n\r\nour Budget, the Hong Kong budget appears to be more flexible and\r\n\r\nbetter  able  to help the business community to  tide  over  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me go to the next important topic. In\r\n\r\nthis  year's Budget, the emphasis is on education.  I feel  that\r\n\r\nat this time of economic and financial turmoil, highlighting and\r\n\r\nplacing  emphasis  on  education is only  right.   I  feel  that\r\n\r\neducation is not only aimed at educating people in English,  the\r\n\r\nScience subjects like Chemistry, Physics, etc, but equally\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  is  the  need  to bring up  our  children  to  become\r\n\r\ncultured,  civilised citizens with traditions.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nwe  must  also  have  moral education,  physical  education  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  education for our children.  If we over-emphasise  on\r\n\r\nintellectual  education, concentrate only on how many  `A's  the\r\n\r\nchildren can score,  and neglect the other aspects of education,\r\n\r\nsuch   as   moral   education,  physical  education,   community\r\n\r\neducation,  then  you may end up with negative  results.   These\r\n\r\nresults  would be the production of a new generation  of  people\r\n\r\nwho  care only for their own self-interest and utilitarian value\r\n\r\nof  life but do not care about respect for the old, the teachers\r\n\r\nand  become  arrogant and swell-headed.  They do not  even  know\r\n\r\nhow to repay the society to serve the country and to be loyal to\r\n\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, juvenile crimes seem to be mounting in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  question is: is it  related  to  the  lack  of\r\n\r\npromotion of moral education in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning, the Lianhe Zaobao published\r\n\r\nan  article by Mr Lee Ther Sen, who is an educationist.  In  the\r\n\r\narticle,  the  importance  and effect  of  moral  education  and\r\n\r\ncommunity education is emphasised.  The article highlighted  one\r\n\r\nimportant  point.   He said that community education  is  social\r\n\r\neducation.  The problem to be solved is to correct the  conflict\r\n\r\nof interest between the individual, the society, the country and\r\n\r\nthe  community.   It  is  to overcome  the  problem  of  extreme\r\n\r\nindividualism so as to provide social cohesion and harmony.   So\r\n\r\ncommunity  education is not only a question of relation  between\r\n\r\nthe  individuals  and the society to promote solidarity,  it  is\r\n\r\nalso  an  important  key  and  a  collective  will  to  overcome\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and  crisis.  Therefore, he  said  that  community\r\n\r\neducation  is  an  indispensable link of  the  five  aspects  of\r\n\r\neducation which must be given its due respect and importance.  I\r\n\r\nentirely agree with what he has said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, Mr Speaker, Sir, if we neglect this invisible\r\n\r\nasset,  we  will  only do so at our own peril.   We  should  not\r\n\r\nneglect  the nurturing of our children in this aspect.  We  must\r\n\r\nbring up a next generation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  so  that we do not produce zombies.   Some  people\r\n\r\nhave  described  that our future generation will  be  just  like\r\n\r\nzombies  or  robots.   They  only  know  Science,  Biology   and\r\n\r\nChemistry.   They  do not know about their oriental  traditions,\r\n\r\nculture  and  roots.  They do not even know the virtues  of  the\r\n\r\noriental  societies.  The Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong,  has\r\n\r\nalready mentioned in one of his recent speeches that we must not\r\n\r\nonly emphasise intellectual education, we must equally emphasise\r\n\r\nthe  other  aspects  of education.  I therefore  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will pay due attention to this aspect, ie,  physical\r\n\r\neducation  and  moral education to bring about  a  better,  more\r\n\r\nsuitable and relevant education system for Singapore, and with a\r\n\r\nproper strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sometimes I cannot help thinking whether\r\n\r\nwe  should have an overall comprehensive review of our education\r\n\r\nsystem, especially for the primary level.  What is taught at the\r\n\r\nprimary   level  might  be  an  over-emphasis  on   intellectual\r\n\r\neducation  and forgetting about good citizenship,  moral  values\r\n\r\nand  ethics.  These are important lessons that they  must  learn\r\n\r\nfor  their foundation in life.  At the same time, I do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether the Government or the Ministry of Education should think\r\n\r\nmore  about  our mother tongue education.  If our mother  tongue\r\n\r\neducation  is  not made more interesting and popular,  then  our\r\n\r\nchildren may not be able to directly understand and get  a  feel\r\n\r\nof  our  own culture and tradition.  So I think it is  necessary\r\n\r\nfor   the  Government  to  review  comprehensively  the  primary\r\n\r\neducation.   This kind of intangible asset is a  very  important\r\n\r\nmotivating force for the progress of our country.  Of course, we\r\n\r\ncannot  live  without money.  But you also cannot  live  without\r\n\r\nthese  virtues.  Without such virtues, I think the prospects  of\r\n\r\nour country would be jeopardised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Thank you for allowing me to\r\n\r\njoin  in  this  debate.   Sir,  I rise  to  support  the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement presented by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current regional crisis has seen our political leaders\r\n\r\nand  Government  acting  in a rational and  sensible  manner  in\r\n\r\ndealing with the difficult and complex issues\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfronting the region.  This Budget is another example  of  the\r\n\r\nprudent  approach that needs to be adopted to ride through  this\r\n\r\ncrisis.  The Budget is conservative and prudent and rightly  so,\r\n\r\nin  the  light  of  the present economic, political  and  social\r\n\r\nuncertainty  facing the region as a whole.   We  must  not  lose\r\n\r\nsight  of the big picture that we are in the midst of a regional\r\n\r\ncrisis of unprecedented proportions.  The outcome of this crisis\r\n\r\nis  not at all clear and is impossible to predict because it  is\r\n\r\ndependent on a multitude of factors and variables, many of which\r\n\r\nare  beyond  our  control.   We must be  prepared  for  whatever\r\n\r\nsituations  that may arise.  But, in the meantime,  to  dedicate\r\n\r\nresources  for  longer  term strategic  investment  in  defence,\r\n\r\neducation, economic infrastructure and skills upgrading and  the\r\n\r\npromotion of high growth industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the dedication of resources for long-term strategic\r\n\r\ninvestment  makes sense for the whole country  as  a  whole,  it\r\n\r\nsounds a bit hollow to the business people who are facing  cash-flow  problems and having difficulties in staying afloat in  the\r\n\r\nshort to medium term.  Businesses would only benefit if they are\r\n\r\nstill  in business when these long-term investments bear  fruit.\r\n\r\nAll these improved economic infrastructure would mean nothing if\r\n\r\nthe  business folds up before then or is so sapped of energy and\r\n\r\nresources  that  they  cannot take  advantage  of  the  eventual\r\n\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues confronting businesses are more short-term in\r\n\r\nnature.  They are looking for and expecting something more  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to help them tide over these difficult  periods\r\n\r\nand survive.  They feel that the policy measures adopted in this\r\n\r\nBudget did not reflect the severity of the current situation and\r\n\r\nquestion  whether the Government's assessment of  the  situation\r\n\r\nwas  based on old statistics compiled a few months ago.  But  if\r\n\r\none  had just visited the Travel Fair over the last weekend  and\r\n\r\nsee the hoards of people snapping up holiday packages, one would\r\n\r\nnever  have  imagined  that we are in the midst  of  a  regional\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding the difference in assessment, I am\r\n\r\ngratified to note that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has assured us that the  Government  will\r\n\r\nmonitor   the  regional  environment  and  economic   conditions\r\n\r\nvigilantly  and  keep in touch with the private sector.   Should\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances turn for the worse, other off-Budget measures\r\n\r\ncould  be  taken  to address the situations  as  and  when  they\r\n\r\ndevelop.   However,  for the present, people  are  shouting  for\r\n\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businesses and workers had hoped for a cut in tax\r\n\r\nrates.  It seems logical that during hard times like these,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should help by collecting less taxes so that  people\r\n\r\ncan take home more.  To someone who received a smaller bonus  or\r\n\r\nno  bonus  at  all last year, or got a small or no pay  increase\r\n\r\nthis year, the natural tendency is for him to wish for a cut  in\r\n\r\nincome tax or an increase in tax rebate to cushion the impact of\r\n\r\nthe  reduction  in  income.  But we must  not  forget  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has already introduced substantial tax cuts over  the\r\n\r\nlast  12  years.   Currently, only about 30% of individuals  pay\r\n\r\npersonal  income  tax  and  corporate  income  tax  is  paid  by\r\n\r\ncompanies  which are doing well enough to generate  the  profit.\r\n\r\nThese  individuals and profitable companies should not shy  away\r\n\r\nfrom their responsibility at a time like this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminded me of the thoughts of our Senior Minister on\r\n\r\nthe  fragility  of a multi-racial society which he  shared  with\r\n\r\njournalists and diplomats at a dinner in June 1996.  He pondered\r\n\r\nthe  question  of whether the Singaporean would share  with  his\r\n\r\nneighbour  who is of a different race in times of severe  stress\r\n\r\nand  starvation.  If there is only one bowl of  rice,  will  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean share with his neighbour?  We are not in the kind of\r\n\r\ncrisis which the Senior Minister had in mind.  Far from it.  But\r\n\r\nare  the more fortunate Singaporeans willing to share with their\r\n\r\nfellow Singaporeans who are not so fortunate?  This is a test of\r\n\r\nour  cohesion and our ability to stay as one nation in times  of\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  The top income earners who are fortunate enough not\r\n\r\nto lose their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njobs and corporations that are making profits must do their part\r\n\r\nby contributing their share in building a better tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also told that the two major problems that\r\n\r\nbusiness  people are presently confronted with are weak regional\r\n\r\nexports  and low domestic demands for their goods and  services,\r\n\r\nand the high cost of doing business in Singapore compared to our\r\n\r\nneighbours.   On  the  first problem of weak  demand,  there  is\r\n\r\nlittle  that we can do right now if the other regional countries\r\n\r\ncut back on their imports because of their economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the domestic front, consumers have every reason to be\r\n\r\ncareful  in  their  spending during times of uncertainty.   Some\r\n\r\nfriends  of  mine have told me that in austere times like  this,\r\n\r\nthey  have to do their marketing and shopping outside Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhere  their  Singapore  dollar carries far  greater  purchasing\r\n\r\npower and goes much further.  Another group of friends I chanced\r\n\r\nupon  at the Travel Fair last weekend said that they could  only\r\n\r\nafford  to take a short holiday this year in the region, because\r\n\r\nthe  tax  rebate was only 5%.  If there had been a  cut  in  tax\r\n\r\nrates or larger rebate given to them, they would have more money\r\n\r\nto  spend on a longer holiday to Europe or to the United States.\r\n\r\nThese  comments  lead me to wonder whether our  retailers  would\r\n\r\nbenefit  from any fiscal measures to increase disposable  income\r\n\r\nat this point in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second problem of high cost, we cannot compete with\r\n\r\nthe  other regional countries based on cost alone.  Before  this\r\n\r\ncrisis,  they  were Asia's tiger economies capable of  producing\r\n\r\nand enjoying many years of high economic growth.  As a result of\r\n\r\nthis  crisis,  their currencies have devalued and  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ntheir  exports had correspondingly decreased.  If and when  they\r\n\r\nget their acts together, restore confidence, put their economies\r\n\r\nback  on track, they will emerge as formidable competitors.   We\r\n\r\nneed  creative solutions to tackle our problems.  We need to  be\r\n\r\nmore  productive and highly skilled so that customers  can  find\r\n\r\ngood value in the goods and services that we produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and skills upgrading for our local workforce are\r\n\r\ntherefore   very  important.   However,  training   and   skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  are often seen by businesses as cost items and  often\r\n\r\nthe first expense to be cut when business is down.  Manpower  is\r\n\r\nour  only  resource  we have as a nation.  We  must  continually\r\n\r\nupgrade  the  skills of our workforce.  In a  downturn  such  as\r\n\r\nthis,  many companies are experiencing the slowdown in  business\r\n\r\nactivities  and  workers  are not fully  occupied.   Instead  of\r\n\r\nkeeping the workers idle or retrenching them, sensible employers\r\n\r\nwould want to take this opportunity to release them for training\r\n\r\nor  retraining.   But many can ill afford the training  cost  in\r\n\r\ndifficult  times like this when budgets are tight.  More  should\r\n\r\nby  done  by the Government to help defray the cost of  training\r\n\r\nand  to  further streamline the procedure for making claims  and\r\n\r\nreimbursement to ease the employers' cash flow situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and skills upgrading should not be confined to the\r\n\r\nlow  skilled  workers, but must be carried out  at  all  levels,\r\n\r\nespecially at the time when globalisation and global competition\r\n\r\ncompel us to attract the best and the brightest to come here  to\r\n\r\nwork, at the top end of the workforce, the professionals and the\r\n\r\nmanagerial executives.  We can expect very high calibre  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  coming  here  from the more developed  countries.   Top\r\n\r\ntalents  are  a  mobile lot.  They go where their  services  are\r\n\r\nneeded and where there is money to be made.  For example, during\r\n\r\nthe  boom  years  of this region, many project  finance  experts\r\n\r\nworked  out  of Singapore to advise on projects in this  region.\r\n\r\nNow  that  these projects are shelved, these experts  have  been\r\n\r\nredeployed  to  other parts of the world where there  are  still\r\n\r\nprojects   to   be   financed.   In  the  meantime,   the   debt\r\n\r\nrestructuring,  corporate recovery and  insolvency  experts  are\r\n\r\nbeing  redeployed from other parts of the world to  this  region\r\n\r\nbecause  their expertise is in short supply here  and  they  are\r\n\r\nneeded to do work.  We cannot therefore be forever dependent  on\r\n\r\nforeign  talents,  just  as we cannot be  dependent  on  foreign\r\n\r\nborrowings  to  drive  our  economy.   Although  talent,  unlike\r\n\r\ncapital cannot be moved away at the mere push of a button\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  click of the mouse, they can still swiftly take flight  when\r\n\r\nthe  country becomes unattractive.  We must therefore  build  up\r\n\r\nour  core  competencies, skills and expertise, just as  we  have\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  strong monetary reserves over time.  Whilst  we  need\r\n\r\nforeign   talents  now,  our  local  workforce  must  take   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to assimilate knowledge, upgrade our skills  and  be\r\n\r\ncompetent to do the job ourselves, in the event that we are left\r\n\r\nto pick up the pieces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst much has been said about retraining and upgrading of\r\n\r\nour  older  less skilled workers, I feel that not much attention\r\n\r\nhas  been  given to white collar workers, even though they  face\r\n\r\nthe  same  uncertainty and problems of retrenchment.  I  know  a\r\n\r\nyoung  graduate bank officer who has worked for 5-8 years as  an\r\n\r\nAssistant  Manager  in  the corporate banking  department  of  a\r\n\r\nforeign bank.  New banking facilities are now put on hold.   She\r\n\r\nis  fearful that she would be retrenched because of a world-wide\r\n\r\ncost  cutting programme implemented by her head office.  I asked\r\n\r\nher  what  she  would  do if indeed she  were  retrenched.   She\r\n\r\nreplied  that  she had no idea, as there was an over  supply  of\r\n\r\npeople  with her skills.  Perhaps she would sell insurance.   If\r\n\r\nthe worst comes to the worst, she may have to give piano lessons\r\n\r\nto earn a living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to believe that being educated, they should\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  take  care  of  themselves  and  find  alternative\r\n\r\nemployment  for  themselves.   But  my  feeling  is  that  many,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  younger ones, simply do not know  what  to  do.\r\n\r\nMany  who  are  in their early to mid-30s have  joined  a  tight\r\n\r\nlabour  market after the last recession in 1985.   Their  skills\r\n\r\nwere very much in demand but they enjoyed good job prospects and\r\n\r\nuninterrupted high earnings for more than a decade.  This is the\r\n\r\nfirst  difficult  period  that they are  encountering  in  their\r\n\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the employees in the financial services sector,\r\n\r\nand  banks  are streamlining their operations and cutting  back,\r\n\r\nsimilar difficulties are faced by conveyancing lawyers, who  are\r\n\r\naffected  by the drop in property transactions, property  agents\r\n\r\nin  a  lacklustre property market and many others.  I would urge\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  to do more and provide more guidance  to  help  them\r\n\r\ncope  with  the crisis.  At the same time, I believe  managerial\r\n\r\nexecutives and skilled workers must also be realistic.   Instead\r\n\r\nof twiddling their thumbs and waiting for the return of the good\r\n\r\nold days, they must proactively retrain to do other work or find\r\n\r\nwork  elsewhere.  Employers and corporate executives  of  search\r\n\r\nfirms have lamented in the past that Singaporean executives were\r\n\r\nspoilt and fussy, and it was very difficult to get a Singaporean\r\n\r\nto  be  posted  to a developing country like China,  Vietnam  or\r\n\r\nMyanmar.  Singaporean executives can no longer be choosy.   Like\r\n\r\nour  counterparts from the developed countries who go where  the\r\n\r\nbusiness is, they must be ready and prepared to be redeployed to\r\n\r\nplaces where we can leverage on our expertise and make full  use\r\n\r\nof  it.   This  is especially so now when there  are  many  good\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  be found in the region and skilled  people  are\r\n\r\ncritically needed to manage them and bring out the true value in\r\n\r\nthese investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a clear underlying message in this budget is that in\r\n\r\nview of the uncertainty, we must keep our resources and reserves\r\n\r\nso  that these can be used at the appropriate time.  Ever  since\r\n\r\nindependence, we have been constantly reminded of  the  need  to\r\n\r\nsave for a rainy day.  We have done so consistently and built up\r\n\r\nstrong  reserves.  Many are now asking whether this is the  time\r\n\r\nto  use  what  we  have saved for so many  years.   The  present\r\n\r\nsituation has been described as the worst in decades.   Is  this\r\n\r\nnot   exactly  the  situation  which  we  have  consciously  and\r\n\r\npainstakingly  prepared  for?  Have  the  rains  which  we  have\r\n\r\nprepared for arrived?  Sir, I believe that we should continue to\r\n\r\nbe  prudent and watchful, because the situation may not have hit\r\n\r\nbottom  yet.   And it is impossible to predict how  events  will\r\n\r\nunfold  in  the near future.  We must therefore be prepared  for\r\n\r\nany eventualities and keep some resources in reserve in case the\r\n\r\nsituation  turns  for the worse, and heavier storms  of  greater\r\n\r\nferocity  hit  us  in  the  future.  In these  difficult  times,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must stand by each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  test  of  our cohesion and our  ability  to  work\r\n\r\ntogether and stay together as one nation in times of difficulty.\r\n\r\nWe  must  remain confident and do our part in building a  better\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nusually difficult to speak of long-term plans when the issues at\r\n\r\nhand  appear overwhelming.  There are numerous illustrations  of\r\n\r\nthis around us.  It was under such an uncertain economic climate\r\n\r\nthat the budget was presented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtues of planning for a sound economy cannot be over\r\n\r\nstated.  It has been this constant push towards identifying  key\r\n\r\nareas  and  then  providing a conducive business environment  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate growth that has enabled us to have a stable  economic\r\n\r\nframework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has added yet another boost to the financial\r\n\r\nservices  sector  amid  concerns  that  some  quarters  may   be\r\n\r\nexperiencing extremely tough business conditions.  In fact,  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  economic  crisis  is testimony  to  the  importance  of\r\n\r\ncharting longer-term growth paths that are sustainable, and also\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of not doing so.  For us in Singapore, where  we  are\r\n\r\nsmall  and  we have no natural resources, we simply cannot  wait\r\n\r\ntill the storm is over to resume long-term planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Incentives for the financial sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is with this perspective that I support the thrust\r\n\r\nof   the   financial  sector  reforms,  as  manifested  in   the\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  range  of initiatives, including  the  incentives\r\n\r\ncontained in the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short-term, although business prospects look\r\n\r\ndaunting  within the Asian region, and concerns mount  over  the\r\n\r\nviability  of major financial institutions, Singapore  continues\r\n\r\nto  be  well-positioned to play a significant role  in  regional\r\n\r\nfinance.  The financial sector reforms will pave the way for  an\r\n\r\neven bigger role, particularly when regional economies begin  to\r\n\r\nrecover.   The  benefits  can be tremendous.   At  the  national\r\n\r\nlevel, there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfurther  growth  impetus to the financial  services  sector  and\r\n\r\ntogether with multiplier effects, to the economy at large.  Once\r\n\r\nwe  have  formed  a  critical mass, we will find  it  easier  to\r\n\r\nsustain stability in growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the industry level, financial institutions can innovate\r\n\r\nto  a greater degree in products and services, thereby enlarging\r\n\r\ntheir  business potential.  Companies, in turn, will  have  more\r\n\r\navenues  of  raising funds for business needs  and  consequently\r\n\r\nrealise an enhanced return on their investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the individual? As retail customers, we can\r\n\r\nenjoy  more  choices  and  newer, more sophisticated  investment\r\n\r\nopportunities.  We will no longer be restricted  by  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nchoice  to  leaving savings as idle deposits.  Instead,  we  can\r\n\r\ngradually   choose  to  diversify  across  different  investment\r\n\r\ninstruments, other than just stocks, or even across the  region,\r\n\r\nif  we  so wish.  We can also avail ourselves of more innovative\r\n\r\nloan schemes for our different needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our local financial institutions, I believe the reforms\r\n\r\ncan  cut both ways.  Competition from non-local institutions who\r\n\r\nhave  expertise  gained elsewhere will no doubt  intensify,  but\r\n\r\nSingapore  banks  can  capitalise on their  long-standing  track\r\n\r\nrecord  and  intimate  local  knowledge  to  consolidate   their\r\n\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing landscape means that Singapore banks will\r\n\r\nincreasingly  find  the  traditional  banking  businesses   more\r\n\r\nchallenging, as companies, especially the bigger ones, no longer\r\n\r\nrely  solely  on  direct borrowings.  They may choose  to  raise\r\n\r\ncapital on a wider scale, via, say, convertible bonds or  borrow\r\n\r\nin  foreign  currency for offshore needs.  The  availability  of\r\n\r\nalternatives  will  increase competition  for  bank  loans  and,\r\n\r\nconsequently, lower spreads on these loans that the banks make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither will companies nor individuals simply leave their\r\n\r\nsurplus cash as fixed deposits, which have hitherto been a major\r\n\r\nsource  of funding for banks.  This may raise the cost of  funds\r\n\r\nfor banks and, similarly, squeeze their spreads again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven both these projected trends, there may then be pressure to\r\n\r\nkeep  loan volumes up by changing the loan mix towards more real\r\n\r\nestate  or property, or by simply assuming more risk.   If  this\r\n\r\nwere  so,  the  resultant bias in asset quality is something  we\r\n\r\nwould have to  be vigilant about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local banks can and should capitalise on their strong\r\n\r\nmarket  presence  in  Singapore to  extend  more,  if  not  new,\r\n\r\nproducts and services.  There needs to be, to borrow the cliche,\r\n\r\n\"a  paradigm shift\", in terms of redefining the reliance on  the\r\n\r\ntraditional bread-and-butter lending business.  They should also\r\n\r\nnot  shy  away from importing the necessary talent to make  this\r\n\r\nquantum leap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst it is inevitable that for Singapore to realise the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  these  reforms,  we  would  have  to  tap  foreign\r\n\r\nexpertise, the Government should ensure a sufficient  supply  of\r\n\r\nmanpower  resources,  suitably trained, to  support  the  larger\r\n\r\nfinancial  role envisaged.  This is to enable more  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto partake of the growing significance of the financial services\r\n\r\npie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proactive stance towards assisting troubled sectors and companies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like my fellow GPC members and Parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues, I would like now to dwell a little on the issues  at\r\n\r\nhand, particularly the plight of the smaller local companies who\r\n\r\nare  bearing the full brunt of the regional crisis.  As you have\r\n\r\nheard,  not only are they experiencing a drastic drop in demand,\r\n\r\nbut  also  are they saddled with bad debts and a credit squeeze,\r\n\r\nwhich all conspire to result in a serious cash flow crunch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has promised that the Government\r\n\r\nwill  monitor  the  current  regional  turmoil  vigilantly   and\r\n\r\nimplement  off-Budget measures should the situation  deteriorate\r\n\r\neven   further.   This  is  a  promise  which  I  believe  many,\r\n\r\nespecially the smaller companies, are clinging on to.  There  is\r\n\r\nconcern, Sir, however, that the speed of deterioration  is  such\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  not have the luxury of reaction time to  anecdotal\r\n\r\nevidence.   Swift  measures may have  to  be  taken  to  counter\r\n\r\nanticipated untoward effects.  To ensure the timeliness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  these  measures, a proactive stance is necessary to  prevent\r\n\r\nproblems from being full-blown.  I would therefore like to  urge\r\n\r\nthe Government to consider extending more assistance, especially\r\n\r\ntowards  easing  cash flow for companies.  This could  take  the\r\n\r\nform  of allowing companies to defer tax payments for a specific\r\n\r\nperiod or increasing the quantum of rebates on property tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\njoin  my  colleagues in supporting the Budget Statement.   At  a\r\n\r\ntime  like  this  when all our neighbours are  tightening  their\r\n\r\nbelts, I think we are very fortunate to have a budget with  $2.7\r\n\r\nbillion in surplus, no increase in taxes (except on cigarettes),\r\n\r\nbut  on the contrary, we have new tax concessions to promote the\r\n\r\nfinancial sector, the transport and logistics sector, exhibition\r\n\r\norganising,  cyber trading and even the recruitment  of  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this very difficult period, the people in the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries are rallying behind their leaders.   The\r\n\r\nThais,  for  example, have their \"Thai help Thai\" campaign,  and\r\n\r\nthe Indonesians have their \"Love the Rupiah\" campaign.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nwe  in  Singapore,  should also have an  \"Appreciate  Singapore\"\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  drive home the message to younger Singaporeans  on\r\n\r\nthe  need  for and the benefit of hard headed economic,  social,\r\n\r\npolitical  and financial policies, which have stood us  in  very\r\n\r\ngood stead in this current turmoil, but which have been the butt\r\n\r\nof  many criticisms at many other times.  Having said that  half\r\n\r\nin  jest, I must add that we must be careful that while  drawing\r\n\r\nlessons from the current Asian economic and currency crisis  for\r\n\r\nthe education and edification of our young, we must be sensitive\r\n\r\nto the needs and feelings of our neighbours.  In fact, we should\r\n\r\ncertainly  use  the occasion to extend a helping hand  to  them,\r\n\r\nwithin our means, of course, whether in monetary support  or  in\r\n\r\nkind.   Such financial support, I presume, will not be reflected\r\n\r\nin the Budget, but off-Budget,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  our  balance  sheet at the appropriate time.   I  think  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore should support our leaders as they try to do\r\n\r\nthis as sensitively as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget has been viewed by many again as a \"Shenton Way\r\n\r\nBudget\" for the many financial and tax incentives it contains to\r\n\r\nbolster  the banking and finance sector.  In my view, we  should\r\n\r\nnot  begrudge  the additional fiscal measures the Government  is\r\n\r\nintroducing  to  attract  even  more  financial  activities   to\r\n\r\nSingapore so as to make it even more competitive than the  other\r\n\r\nAsian  cities.  In fact, having been in the banking and  finance\r\n\r\nindustry personally, I can tell you that the feedback from  many\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions in the last Budget was that the  ceiling\r\n\r\nfor  some  of these incentives was set so high that only  a  few\r\n\r\nbigger  fund managers benefited.  I am glad that in this Budget,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance has lowered the threshold  requirement\r\n\r\nfor  fund  managers to qualify for full tax exemption  from  $10\r\n\r\nbillion to $5 billion of non-resident funds for a period of five\r\n\r\nyears.  This will allow more fund managers to take advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must point out that many fund managers move to,\r\n\r\nor  increase their operations in Singapore not only  because  of\r\n\r\ntax  incentives, but also in the hope of getting more funds from\r\n\r\nthe Government, statutory boards and Government-linked companies\r\n\r\nto  manage.  In this respect, the fund managers have been a  bit\r\n\r\ndisappointed  with the great caution, or reluctance  with  which\r\n\r\nfunds have been farmed out to the private sector for management,\r\n\r\neven   after  the  Senior  Minister's  announcement  of  greater\r\n\r\nliberalisation in this area a few years ago.  I am happy to note\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government has given renewed commitment to liberalise\r\n\r\nthe  fund management industry and allow the private sector  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers to manage more Government funds.  This will go  a  long\r\n\r\nway  to help our fund management industry to grow and strengthen\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bond market is in an even greater stage of infancy as\r\n\r\nthe  Government which normally provides for the backbone for the\r\n\r\nbond market in most countries does\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot borrow from the public.  I welcome the package of incentives\r\n\r\nto   promote  the  development  of  an  active  bond  market  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We  certainly need a more active and  vibrant  bond\r\n\r\nmarket if we want to be a premier financial centre in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the incentives to promote our financial industry\r\n\r\nhave been targeted at companies, ie, only the companies are seen\r\n\r\nto  benefit from the tax concessions.  I have been told by  some\r\n\r\npeople  that this alone may not be adequate to entice  companies\r\n\r\nto move to Singapore because employers are still finding it hard\r\n\r\nto  convince  their employees, especially those  based  in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  to relocate to Singapore because they would be worse  off\r\n\r\nin  Singapore in terms of personal tax status.  Some  have  even\r\n\r\nsuggested  perhaps that the Government should give  special  tax\r\n\r\nconcessions for such employees to entice them over to Singapore.\r\n\r\nPersonally,  I  do  not support this suggestion  as  this  would\r\n\r\nresult  in reverse discrimination, ie, foreigners would enjoy  a\r\n\r\nbetter  tax package than locals.  I believe strongly in a  level\r\n\r\nplaying  field  for  both  locals and foreigners,  whatever  the\r\n\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to express my support for the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  decision  to  keep  a  tight  lid  on  operational\r\n\r\nexpenditure, but increase capital expenditure in the  key  areas\r\n\r\nof  education,  economic  infrastructure  and  defence.   It  is\r\n\r\ncertainly   an   ideal   time   to   accelerate   key   economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  projects like the reclamation  at  Changi  East,\r\n\r\nJurong  Island Phase 3,  the upgrading of industrial  facilities\r\n\r\nat  Tuas, and even the construction of the North-East MRT  line.\r\n\r\nThe  efforts  to  boost  the  economy  through  counter-cyclical\r\n\r\nspending will not only save taxpayers' money during the regional\r\n\r\ndownturn,  but  also be appreciated by all in the  building  and\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.  Having said that, I would like  to  make\r\n\r\nan observation that we have been building many 5-star facilities\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Changi Airport and so on, when we could afford them\r\n\r\nin  better  times.   No doubt these facilities  have  helped  to\r\n\r\nestablish  Singapore  as  No. 1 in many  areas,  from  the  best\r\n\r\nairport  to  the best port in the world.  During this  downturn,\r\n\r\nhowever, as part of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nausterity  drive, perhaps 4-star quality may suffice, especially\r\n\r\nfor facilities for internal use which are not open to foreigners\r\n\r\nor  tourists.   For example, tiles should be used  in  place  of\r\n\r\nmarble  or  granite  in some places.  This would  also  send  an\r\n\r\nimportant  message  to the young that we should  learn  to  live\r\n\r\nwithin our means and tighten our belts when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I congratulate the Finance Minister for finally\r\n\r\nagreeing  to abolish stamp duty on all instruments,  except  for\r\n\r\nthose   which   relate  to  stock  and  shares,  and   immovable\r\n\r\nproperties.  I had brought this up last year in the Committee of\r\n\r\nSupply  and  I  thank the Minister for his quick  response  this\r\n\r\nyear.   I  am sure this move will go a long way to reduce  costs\r\n\r\nand inconvenience to businesses and members of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to comment on the Electronic Road\r\n\r\nPricing and vehicle tax rationalisation.  The ERP rates and  the\r\n\r\nvehicle  tax  rationalisation  scheme have been  announced  last\r\n\r\nweek.   Although I am happy that the exercise would  be  revenue\r\n\r\nneutral  in  about  eight years, I must say that  I  was  a  bit\r\n\r\ndisappointed  that the Ministry did not take  advantage  of  the\r\n\r\noccasion  to  simplify  the road tax structure.   The  structure\r\n\r\ntoday  is  still  very  complicated, and I believe  the  complex\r\n\r\nstructure  was a result of the need to include a wealth  tax  in\r\n\r\nthe  formula.   My  question  is this:  would  it  not  be  more\r\n\r\nefficient to collect the wealth tax upfront one-off in the  cost\r\n\r\nof the car, for example, the Additional Registration Fee and the\r\n\r\nCOE,  than to do this every year through the road tax?  The road\r\n\r\ntax,  as we all know, is not really a usage tax.  It is a  fixed\r\n\r\ncost  that we have to pay every year, much like a flat fee, just\r\n\r\nlike  the registration fee.  The only real usage taxes  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  are the ERP and the tax on petrol because they go up  with\r\n\r\ngreater  usage.  So the ARF and the COE, in my view, could  have\r\n\r\nbeen used as the sole wealth tax that vary with the OMV cost  of\r\n\r\nthe  car.  Strictly speaking, a larger engine capacity of a  car\r\n\r\ndoes not necessarily mean that the car is more luxurious.  So my\r\n\r\nmessage   here   is:  in  formulating  taxes,  I   believe   the\r\n\r\nconsideration  for equity should be balanced  by  the  need  for\r\n\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T.E.

In both these organisations, Mr Philip Yeo is  the\r\n\r\nChairman.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members of this House have spoken against the EDB's\r\n\r\nand  the NCB's actions to name three scholars who chose to break\r\n\r\ntheir  bonds rather than to return home to serve.  Collectively,\r\n\r\nthey  have  put  forward a number of arguments to support  their\r\n\r\nstand.  To paraphrase, these are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that scholars who break their bonds will still\r\n\r\nreturn  to  serve  Singapore in other ways.  By  pursuing  their\r\n\r\ninterests  and  developing their talents, they  are  of  greater\r\n\r\nservice to Singapore, not lesser.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, breaking a bond is not such a big issue that such\r\n\r\nscholars  should  be  named  and humiliated  in  public  and  so\r\n\r\ndiscourage others from taking up scholarships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, that a practical solution to this problem would be\r\n\r\nfor organisations to increase the number of scholarships so that\r\n\r\nthe  net  number of returning scholars would still be sufficient\r\n\r\nfor the organisations' needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who hold these views are saying that the scholarship\r\n\r\nis  just  a  commercial agreement which can be  set  aside  when\r\n\r\nexpedient  and  settled  by the payment  of  money.   But  every\r\n\r\nscholar  knows  that  this  is not true.   They  know  that  the\r\n\r\nprestige and honour that accompany a scholarship carries with it\r\n\r\nan  equal  measure of responsibility.  The more prestigious  the\r\n\r\nscholarship  the  greater  the responsibilities:  to  return  to\r\n\r\nserve,  to  lead,  to  benefit future  generations.   These  are\r\n\r\nunwritten  obligations  but  well-known  to  both  scholar   and\r\n\r\nsponsor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that EDB and NCB did the right thing by naming\r\n\r\nthe  scholars  who broke their bonds before they even  completed\r\n\r\ntheir  studies.   By  so doing, they affirm the  high  standards\r\n\r\nwhich  they  expect  of these scholars and the  importance  they\r\n\r\nplace  on  their  moral  values in addition  to  their  academic\r\n\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the arguments which were raised by the MPs\r\n\r\nwho disagree with this stand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first argument that scholars who break the bonds will\r\n\r\nserve  society  better  in other ways  fails  to  recognise  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of integrity.  To unilaterally break a  bond  is  to\r\n\r\ndishonour  a  promise.  This is not a small matter.   For  if  a\r\n\r\nscholar  decides not to keep his promise now, how can we  depend\r\n\r\non  him when he promises to do more later?  He may be smart  and\r\n\r\nwell  qualified.  But how will we know that his new promise will\r\n\r\nnot  be broken as well?  Integrity once broken up is like Humpty\r\n\r\nDumpty - hard to put together again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument that bond-breakers are publicly\r\n\r\nhumiliated  when their names are published is inconsistent  with\r\n\r\nitself.  If the scholars argue that they have done no wrong, why\r\n\r\ndo  they  consider it a shame to have their decisions  noted  in\r\n\r\npublic?  If, indeed, they had the greater interest of society in\r\n\r\nmind  when  they  broke their bonds, why  do  they  object  that\r\n\r\nsociety should know?  By that logic, they have discharged  their\r\n\r\nobligations by paying their bonds.  By the same logic, should we\r\n\r\nnot  tell the public that they have given up their scholarships,\r\n\r\njust  as  the  public was told when they received their  awards?\r\n\r\nAnd  if  this policy discourages those who have no intention  to\r\n\r\never   serve  their  bonds,  would  we  not  have  created  more\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  others  who  are  ready  to  put  country  and\r\n\r\ncorporation before self?  If there is shame in public naming, it\r\n\r\nis  only  because the bond-breakers know that they have  done  a\r\n\r\ndishonourable thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion that we should offer more scholarships so\r\n\r\nthat  bond-breakers  will  not impact the  sponsors'  deployment\r\n\r\nplans will only make matters worse.  Consider this analogy.   Do\r\n\r\nwe employ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  road-sweepers if pedestrians throw more litter?  Or should\r\n\r\nwe  find  ways  and  means to remind pedestrians  that  throwing\r\n\r\nlitter is wrong, and to penalise those who do so?  The more road-sweepers we employ, the more litter will be thrown.  Do we  then\r\n\r\nkeep  on  employing road-sweepers?  Will we become a  nation  of\r\n\r\nroad-sweepers?   In like logic, if we signal that  bond-breaking\r\n\r\nis  acceptable, will we not only be encouraging more scholars to\r\n\r\nbreak their bonds?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, EDB and NCB have not taken the stand that bonds can\r\n\r\nnever  be  broken.   Indeed, I am told that EDB  has  allowed  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of scholars to break their bonds, some even before  they\r\n\r\ncompleted  their studies.  There were various reasons for  this,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  ill  health or family problems, or poor organisational\r\n\r\nfit.   And EDB has also exercised flexibility when scholars have\r\n\r\nwanted  to  stay on to further studies or to transfer  to  other\r\n\r\norganisations.   But  what  is not acceptable  to  them  is  for\r\n\r\nscholars  to unilaterally discharge themselves simply by  opting\r\n\r\nto  pay  off their bonds, and in the case of the three  scholars\r\n\r\nnamed, without serving even one day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has benefited from the many thousands of scholars\r\n\r\nwho  have  come back to serve their bonds.  Since Mr Philip  Yeo\r\n\r\njoined  the  EDB, more than 300 new EDB scholarships  have  been\r\n\r\nawarded.  These are precious opportunities.  EDB's scholars  owe\r\n\r\na  debt  of  gratitude to a selfless and tireless  Chairman  who\r\n\r\ncanvassed  far  and wide to convince corporate sponsors  of  the\r\n\r\nvalue of investing in Singapore's young.  They would do well  to\r\n\r\nrepay it by not breaking their bonds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who says that the Chairman of EDB has become too big\r\n\r\nfor  his  shoes  does not know the man nor his  heart.   I  have\r\n\r\nworked  for him for 20 years.  He is demanding, and in  his  own\r\n\r\nwords,  a  slave  driver.   But  he  has  a  heart  that  cares,\r\n\r\nespecially for his staff and his scholars.  We have heard strong\r\n\r\naccusations about his improper conduct, within the protection of\r\n\r\nthis  House.   But we did not hear why he said,  what  he  said.\r\n\r\nThose who presented the story half-told would do justly to  tell\r\n\r\nthe other half.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koh Buck Song of The Straits Times was right in saying that\r\n\r\nbond-breaking  is  really  about bigger  issues,  by  attracting\r\n\r\ntalent and heartware.  It is these things and more.  It is about\r\n\r\nour values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we look for reasons to break a promise, we will\r\n\r\nalways find one.  Integrity costs.  But unless we are willing to\r\n\r\npay  the  price, not in dollars, but in self-sacrifice, then  we\r\n\r\nshould not be so quick to make the promise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A' level results are out, and scholarship season is now\r\n\r\nopen.  My advice to would-be scholars is to choose carefully and\r\n\r\nwisely.  Do not take a scholarship just for the perks.  Choose a\r\n\r\nscholarship  based  on  what  your  interests  are   and   which\r\n\r\norganisations you are willing to commit to.  Remember,  that  in\r\n\r\nthree,  four  or five years' time, you would have to  return  to\r\n\r\nface  yourself, whether to honour your promise or to  find  some\r\n\r\nexcuse to go your own way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank the Minister for Finance for giving us a\r\n\r\nBudget  that  recognises  our immediate  needs  and  which  also\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  provide  for  our future  growth.   I  share  the\r\n\r\nsentiments of my many colleagues who have highlighted  the  need\r\n\r\nto  pay  closer attention to small businesses which are  failing\r\n\r\nand  workers in danger of losing their jobs.  The help which  is\r\n\r\nneeded  goes beyond tax reliefs and rate cuts.  It is  important\r\n\r\nat  this  time that every Government agency also pays particular\r\n\r\nattention  to  the  myriad  problems  which  will  arise.   Some\r\n\r\ncompanies  may  take advantage of the situation to  curry  extra\r\n\r\nfavours  from  the  Government.   But  many  will  face  genuine\r\n\r\nproblems   from   rules  and  regulations  which   were   merely\r\n\r\ninconvenient  when  times were good but which  may  now  make  a\r\n\r\ndifference  between break-even and bankruptcy.   At  this  time,\r\n\r\nmore than ever, the public service needs to be alert to the need\r\n\r\nto  reinvent  itself to ensure that its policies and  procedures\r\n\r\nare sensitive to the problems faced by the business community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever surprises the future may hold for us, we have\r\n\r\na strong economic foundation to meet these challenges.  But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhether  or not we succeed does not depend on just our financial\r\n\r\nstrength  but  also  on the integrity and  loyalty  of  all  our\r\n\r\npeople.   As individuals and as a society, let us pull  together\r\n\r\nand  act  with purpose, not out of fear nor merely for  monetary\r\n\r\ngain,  but  because we are committed to do right and  worthwhile\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> A point of clarification.\r\n\r\nI have listened to David's comment.

I do\r\n\r\nnot  think we need to.  Neither do I want to appear sweeping the\r\n\r\nissue  under the carpet, for I agree with him that the issue  is\r\n\r\nnot  just about scholarships and bond-breaking, but it is  about\r\n\r\nour  greater  values, our social and national  bonding.   And  I\r\n\r\ntrust there will be another occasion, perhaps with all those who\r\n\r\nhave  spoken on this matter present, and we will thrash  it  out\r\n\r\nonce  and for all, for it is a very important issue, and I think\r\n\r\nwe should not take it lightly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of the Budget presented by our\r\n\r\nrespected Finance Minister, Dr Richard Hu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all kinds of labels have been given to Dr Hu and his\r\n\r\nbudget over the years that the latter must by now surpass many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  clever  images and adjectives chosen for branded  goods\r\n\r\nnormally given by the media and the commercial jargon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Lim Boon Heng, Minister without Portfolio and\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the NTUC, said in the latest NTUC News, why\r\n\r\ncall  it  prudent, as though Dr Hu's Budget had  been  imprudent\r\n\r\npreviously.  True, the Finance Minister has always been prim and\r\n\r\nproper, and precise to the needs of the day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that Dr Hu is no prima donna. Dr Hu has\r\n\r\nalways  been  patient and open to suggestions and  we  therefore\r\n\r\nappeal  to his good sense to prevail.  And also since Dr Hu  has\r\n\r\npromised that the Budget is not the-all, and that the Government\r\n\r\nwill  respond  with  off-Budget measures,  we  stand  reassured.\r\n\r\nAfter all, Dr Hu said, \"we have more than adequate resources  to\r\n\r\ncope  with  any  eventuality.\"  But, like Dr Lee Tsao  Yuan,  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh and many others, I would rather like to see  more\r\n\r\nof those off-Budget measures soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the comment that we do not need a `crisis'\r\n\r\nbudget,  but  neither should we be near `complacent'  about  the\r\n\r\npossible  effects of the economic uncertainties of  the  region.\r\n\r\nIn the words of the cool, calm and collected Dr Richard Hu, this\r\n\r\neconomic outlook is \"volatile and unpredictable.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to continue to monitor the situation closely and\r\n\r\nrespond  accordingly.  After all, being nimble has  always  been\r\n\r\nSingapore's  forte.  But allow me to reiterate,  the  signs  are\r\n\r\ntelling  us  that  we  would be better off with  the  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures sooner than later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was only eight months ago that quite a\r\n\r\nfew  Members in the House questioned the need for the Government\r\n\r\nto  keep  such  a  large current surplus for Fiscal  Year  1997,\r\n\r\nsuggesting  more  could  be done with  the  money  to  help  the\r\n\r\nbusiness and the people to be more productive.  Dr Hu stood  his\r\n\r\nground, reminding us of the need for prudence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo and behold, soon after the debate, regional events began\r\n\r\nto unfold exposing the fragile nature of the region's financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfoundation.  The currency and economic turmoil that followed was\r\n\r\nunprecedented.   The  ramifications are  serious  and  the  full\r\n\r\neffects are yet to unfold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the budget surplus proposed for Fiscal Year 1998 was\r\n\r\nreduced  by  about 50% compared to Fiscal Year  1997,  ie,  from\r\n\r\n$5.09  billion to $2.73 billion.  This looks credible.  This,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, is for good reasons.  It has allowed a budget that will\r\n\r\nresult  in  a 25% increase in development spending and  selected\r\n\r\ntax reliefs, especially in property and banking.  However, since\r\n\r\nthese are high growth sectors, the ripple effect will be felt by\r\n\r\nmany, not only in `Shenton Way' but also by workers at large.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to Singapore's economic development philosophy, we\r\n\r\nfind spending money on productive forces more effective than  on\r\n\r\nthe consumptive nature.  Put simply, it follows more of teaching\r\n\r\nthem  to fish rather than providing the fish itself on a  silver\r\n\r\nplatter.  That, I agree, is a good line for a better catch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my concern is, do enough Singaporeans\r\n\r\nappreciate  and  understand  the  seriousness  of  the   ongoing\r\n\r\nregional  and  economic  turmoil since  last  July.   As  Dr  Hu\r\n\r\nsuggested  in  his first two sentences of the Budget  Statement,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  7.8% growth in the economy in 1997 did not  reflect\r\n\r\nthe seriousness of the situation.  The question now is: does the\r\n\r\nproposed 1998 Budget help to do so?  Yes, there is less surplus.\r\n\r\nYes,  there is more on development spending.  Yes, there is  tax\r\n\r\nrelief for selected sectors.  Yes, Dr Hu has promised more  help\r\n\r\nin case of any \"sudden downturn\", but could not more be done now\r\n\r\nto  help  drive  home  the point about the  seriousness  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation and to better prepare the population to take advantage\r\n\r\nof  the opportunities later?  We can also ask: is the Budget not\r\n\r\ntoo  prudent?  When we are expecting a possible growth  rate  as\r\n\r\nlow  as 2.5%, should not more pump-priming be done?  Do we  need\r\n\r\nall the over $2 billion surplus in difficult times?  Surely,  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  to  be  caught again like in  the  mid-80s.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  why  was  the  individual  tax  rebate  for  Year   of\r\n\r\nAssessment 1998 be reduced by half to 5% only?  Many people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  asking: is that the way the Government wishes to help  when\r\n\r\ntimes were to get difficult because of the currency and economic\r\n\r\nturmoil in the region?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there is this promise of off-Budget measures\r\n\r\nif  and  when the situation worsens but Singaporeans are anxious\r\n\r\nto  see  the kind of immediate signals the Government  would  be\r\n\r\nwilling to show or give in terms of budgetary/fiscal measures to\r\n\r\nhelp  alleviate the position of those affected, especially those\r\n\r\nfrom the lower-middle and lower income groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area of immediate concern is the fate of workers who\r\n\r\nmay  be  retrenched,  which  we are  told,  whose  numbers  will\r\n\r\nincrease.   There  is  room  for more  assurances  and  concrete\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  help them.  The Government should also  consider\r\n\r\nfunding  CDCs  to monitor the situation at the grassroots  level\r\n\r\nand  to coordinate the assistance programme necessary.  This  of\r\n\r\ncourse  could  be done in conjunction with the new  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower  and NTUC.  Of course, we would like to see help  being\r\n\r\ngiven  especially to those who want to be helped.  Generally,  I\r\n\r\ngather  Singaporeans have three to six months  of  savings,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  situation worsens, especially for  those  retrenched,\r\n\r\nwhat kind of safety net can we help them with, without of course\r\n\r\nsuccumbing  to  welfarism.  In this context,  many  workers  and\r\n\r\nunion leaders are also wondering what signals the Government  is\r\n\r\nsending  for  worker training and skills redevelopment.   It  is\r\n\r\nhardly  visible  in  the 1998 Budget.  In fact,  a  most  marked\r\n\r\nomission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More can and should be done for skills upgrading. The\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) deserves more attention and\r\n\r\nfinancial  back-up.   SRP  is  currently  helping  to  speed  up\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of a national skills certification and  recognition\r\n\r\nsystem  in Singapore and promote industry-wide collaboration  in\r\n\r\nskills upgrading and certification.  These projects initiated by\r\n\r\nNTUC and supported by EDB, PSB, ITE and Polytechnics show\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromise  and should therefore be given further financial  boost.\r\n\r\nAnd  I am not talking of a token allocation.  This should  be  a\r\n\r\nbig billion dollar item for the medium and longer term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should team up with the labour movement and\r\n\r\nemployers  to  instil  a  greater sense of  urgency  for  worker\r\n\r\ntraining and upgrading.  This calls for a significant commitment\r\n\r\nfrom the Government in terms of funding.  More could and must be\r\n\r\ndone  for  worker  training and skills  upgrading,  through  SRP\r\n\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the cool, calm and collected Dr Richard Hu is back\r\n\r\nin  the House, I hope he will be creative in dishing out  a  sum\r\n\r\nthat will help reflect and send a \"collective will\" message that\r\n\r\nwe  are serious about skills upgrading.  After all this, we want\r\n\r\nour  workers and economy to come out leaner and fitter  and,  in\r\n\r\nfact, more resilient.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Can I get a\r\n\r\nclarification from Mr Zainul?  If I heard him correctly, he says\r\n\r\nthat,  as regards retrenchment, he wants the Government to  fund\r\n\r\nCDCs  and coordinate at grassroots level.  I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nhim   how  does  funding  of  the  CDCs  help  workers  who  are\r\n\r\nretrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two\r\n\r\npoints  I  mentioned  in that statement.  One  is  for  CDCs  to\r\n\r\nmonitor the situation at the grassroots level, in terms  of  the\r\n\r\neffects  of  the economic turmoil in the region and once  it  is\r\n\r\nfelt  by the people who are retrenched and they are feeling  the\r\n\r\nhardship, the CDC will be close enough to the ground to  monitor\r\n\r\nand  see  what  kind  of  problems the  economic  situation  has\r\n\r\ncreated.   The  other  point  is in terms  of  coordinating  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes and the Government could help either through NTUC  or\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Manpower and the CDC, again being close to  the\r\n\r\nground, could also help to coordinate these programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I get a further clarification?

That was also tackled in my speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  under  the  shadow  of  the  regional  financial\r\n\r\nturmoil,  the Minister for Finance announced the 1998 Budget  on\r\n\r\n27th February.  But in this Budget, the measures relevant to the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community are inadequate.  This can be  borne  out  in\r\n\r\nthree  areas.   Firstly,  there  is  a  wide  gap  between   the\r\n\r\n\"purchase  order\"  placed before the Budget  and  the  \"delivery\r\n\r\norder\"  given  after the Budget.  Secondly, on  2nd  March  this\r\n\r\nyear,  there  was  a significant drop in the share  market  that\r\n\r\nshows the disappointment of investors over the Budget.  Thirdly,\r\n\r\nthe  reaction  as reported in the media showed  that  there  are\r\n\r\nvoices  of  disappointment everywhere and the voices  are  quite\r\n\r\nloud indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I would not be so naive as to indulge in wishful\r\n\r\nthinking  that  the  Government will deliver  according  to  the\r\n\r\n\"purchase order\".  Based on our trust in the Government, we  can\r\n\r\nput ourselves into the shoes of the Government and look from  an\r\n\r\noverall  angle the intention of the 1998 Budget. We cannot  deny\r\n\r\nthat  the  1998 Budget, being extremely conservative, does  have\r\n\r\ncertain positive implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, firstly, it conveys the full confidence of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in not allowing the little boat of Singapore  to  go\r\n\r\nadrift  in  a  big storm as it firmly controls  the  rudder  and\r\n\r\nremains on  course towards our long-term objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, before the uncertainties of political and\r\n\r\neconomic  factors outside Singapore are resolved,  any  measures\r\n\r\nput  up  by  the  Government could turn out  inadequate  or  not\r\n\r\ndirectly  relevant.   So  instead  of  indiscriminate   use   of\r\n\r\nmedicine, it is better that we watch and monitor the development\r\n\r\nof events and situation before prescribing the right medicine to\r\n\r\ncure the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, in the midst of disappointment, we have not\r\n\r\nmissed  the  promise  of  the Finance  Minister  for  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Therefore, we have turned our disappointment over the\r\n\r\nBudget into new hopes that the Government, presently taking  the\r\n\r\n\"containing   motion  with  quietude\"  stand,  will   definitely\r\n\r\nintroduce appropriate off-Budget measures at the right  time  to\r\n\r\nhelp the local industries and enterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the business community has always been\r\n\r\nfaced  with  the heavy cost of doing business in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthey  have to cudgel their brains.  The business people have  to\r\n\r\nface  the  problem  of lower sales and the  pressure  of  rising\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost.   This is what we call \"adding frost  to  snow\".\r\n\r\nAccording  to  the Economic Intelligence Unit's  survey  report,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  cost  of business is ranked No. 10  in  the  world,\r\n\r\ncomparable  to that in Europe and America, and much higher  than\r\n\r\nour   neighbouring  countries  like  Malaysia,   Indonesia   and\r\n\r\nThailand.  I think that the most important task ahead is that we\r\n\r\nmust  lower the cost of doing business here.  This is an  urgent\r\n\r\ntask to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government can look into the direct costs\r\n\r\nof  business  like  factory rentals, shop  rentals,  wage  cost,\r\n\r\nGovernment taxes and charges, transportation cost, etc.  If  all\r\n\r\nthe  Government agencies can look into the situation and quickly\r\n\r\nadjust  such  costs  of businesses or to suspend  collection  of\r\n\r\ncertain  charges, it will help our local businesses  and,  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain degree, restore the confidence of the business people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the budget, HDB and JTC have already\r\n\r\nannounced the freezing of rentals for one more year.  Of course,\r\n\r\nfreezing  is better than no freezing.  We appreciate that.   But\r\n\r\njust  freezing  alone  is  not enough.   The  Government  should\r\n\r\nconsider lowering the rentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, the House already approved the motion tabled by\r\n\r\nMr  Cyrille  Tan  on tripartism.  The Government's   refusal  to\r\n\r\nreduce  rentals  appears to go counter to this  spirit,  because\r\n\r\njust freezing rentals is not enough.  In good times, enterprises\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmove forward.  The rentals go upwards.  But now through no fault\r\n\r\nof  ours,  but  because of the effect of the regional  financial\r\n\r\nturmoil,  business  suffers losses.  We move  backward  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment just freezes rentals.  That is \"running on  the  same\r\n\r\nspot\".   When  the economy prospers and the businesses  recover,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will not stand there and wait for the businesses\r\n\r\nto  catch up.  Instead, it will immediately raise rentals.  This\r\n\r\namounts  to  sharing  prosperity  in  full  while  only  sharing\r\n\r\nhardship  in  part  and will delay the recovery  of  businesses.\r\n\r\nSuch  practices  do not seem to be totally consistent  with  the\r\n\r\nspirit of tripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from rentals, another burden on the businesses in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  the  wage  cost.  Compared  to  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  our  wage cost is already quite  high.   The  recent\r\n\r\ndevaluation of the currencies of our neighbouring countries  has\r\n\r\nmade our companies and businesses even less competitive in terms\r\n\r\nof  wage cost.  In the long run, this will be detrimental to our\r\n\r\nexports  and  to our foreign trade.  I feel that the Government,\r\n\r\napart  from  encouraging our businesses and workers  to  enhance\r\n\r\nproductivity, should also help to reduce the wage cost  for  our\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   So  I  would again appeal  to  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nexercise restraint on wage increases in the public sector, so as\r\n\r\nnot  to create a vicious competition that may push up wage level\r\n\r\nin the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government levy on foreign workers is aimed at\r\n\r\npreventing undue increase in foreign labour and social problems.\r\n\r\nThis levy is to control the demand for foreign labour.  But  now\r\n\r\nwith  this  economic turmoil, our demand for foreign labour  has\r\n\r\ndropped.  So this is the right time for the Government to  lower\r\n\r\nsuch levy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, faced with the financial turmoil sweeping\r\n\r\nacross  the  region, we should all be united together  with  one\r\n\r\nheart to make the necessary sacrifices and preparations to avoid\r\n\r\nan  economic  recession.   If  this  negative  situation  should\r\n\r\npersist or even worsen over the next few\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmonths,   I   would  urge  the  Government  to  decisively   and\r\n\r\nimmediately adjust the CPF contribution by employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1998 Budget contains an increase of 30% on education\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   But  no  new measures have  been  introduced  for\r\n\r\nretraining  of  employees.   As  the  Government  has  said,  an\r\n\r\neconomic slowdown is the best time for retraining of our workers\r\n\r\nand  employees.  Our labour market is highly flexible,  allowing\r\n\r\nfree competition to determine the allocation of human resources.\r\n\r\nAs such, if company A pays for training an employee, the benefit\r\n\r\nmay  go  to a new employer, company B.  This is to say that  the\r\n\r\nvalue-added to the employee will not necessarily go back to  the\r\n\r\nemployer  paying  for it.  But for the whole of  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nnation   for  sure  benefits.   In  other  words,  like   formal\r\n\r\neducation,  staff  training is also to  some  extent  a  \"public\r\n\r\ngood\".  Therefore,  in terms of staff training,  the  Government\r\n\r\nmust  play a greater role and give more incentives.  I think  it\r\n\r\nis very much the Government's responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Government taxes and charges by the\r\n\r\nstatutory bodies have also become a rather substantial  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  business cost.  Therefore, the Government should constantly\r\n\r\nreview  such  taxes  and  charges and  evaluate  their  negative\r\n\r\neffect.   And, if necessary, the Government must take off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  reduce the company tax, GST,  road  tax  and  port\r\n\r\ncharges,  etc,  to  ensure  that  our  competitiveness  can   be\r\n\r\nsustained.    As  encouraged  by  the  Government,  many   local\r\n\r\nenterprises  have gone regional.  But, unfortunately,  they  are\r\n\r\nsuffering heavy losses in this financial turmoil.  Not only have\r\n\r\nthey failed to get proper returns, they also suffer great losses\r\n\r\nand heavy setbacks because of the currency turmoil.  In order to\r\n\r\nmaintain  their  morale  and  to  help  them  go  through   this\r\n\r\ndifficulty,  I  think  the  Government  should  liberalise   the\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax  system  and give the enterprises  the  necessary\r\n\r\nassistance  by allowing companies to deduct losses of subsidiary\r\n\r\ncompanies  overseas from their group profit.  In  addition,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  also  grant them  double  tax  deduction  in\r\n\r\nrespect of wage cost overseas and other related costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government reduced the property tax to 12%\r\n\r\nin  order to help lighten the burden of property owners.  At the\r\n\r\nsame  time, however, the Government, raised the annual value  of\r\n\r\nproperties so that the quantum of tax paid has actually gone up.\r\n\r\nNow,  property  prices have already come down.   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould also correspondingly lower the annual value of properties\r\n\r\nand  the  quantum of property tax.  I hope that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  further  reduce  property tax to 10%,  so  as  to  further\r\n\r\nlighten  the burden of the property owners and, thereby  helping\r\n\r\nthe property owners to maintain their confidence in the property\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's motor vehicles are the most expensive in the\r\n\r\nworld.   Everybody  knows  that.  From  the  point  of  view  of\r\n\r\neconomic  theory,  we can say that when the price  is  low,  the\r\n\r\ndemand will be high.  When the demand is low, the price will  be\r\n\r\nhigh.   This is indisputable.  Given that the Government  adopts\r\n\r\nthe   COE  system  to  restrict  the  increase  in  the  vehicle\r\n\r\npopulation,  the high cost of motor vehicles naturally  follows.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has  already started to increase  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nvehicle  usage and,  proportionately reduce the cost of  vehicle\r\n\r\nownership.   Still, I feel that basing the costs  of  owning  or\r\n\r\nusing motor vehicle completely on economic efficiency and market\r\n\r\npricing has its drawback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a rich man is prepared to spend $100,000 to\r\n\r\nbuy  a  car  for  his  university-going daughter  to  avoid  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience of using the public transport. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\na  small  businessman can only afford $80,000 to buy  a  vehicle\r\n\r\nindispensable  for his business. Under our present  free  market\r\n\r\ncompetition  framework, the businessman will  lose  out  in  the\r\n\r\ncompetition,  and the rich man's daughter will get  to  use  the\r\n\r\ncar.    Is   this  outcome  optimal  for  Singapore's   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment?  I doubt very much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a simple issue. Precisely because many\r\n\r\nGovernment policy issues are not simple and need talented people\r\n\r\nto  work out good solutions that we whole-heartedly support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh-pay  policy  to  recruit talents into  the  Government.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve the Government has the means and the ability to think of\r\n\r\na  better  way  to  lower the transportation  costs  to  a  more\r\n\r\nreasonable level, so as not to hurt the competitiveness  of  our\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the announcement of the budget, the Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber  of  Commerce and Industry conducted  a  survey\r\n\r\namong  its members.  The result shows that many enterprises  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses  have suffered as a result of the regional  financial\r\n\r\nturmoil.  We know the Government's economic policies are  driven\r\n\r\nby  strategic  long- and medium-term plans and objectives.   For\r\n\r\nmany  years,  we  have  accepted the Government's  self-reliance\r\n\r\nprinciple,  ie,  within the law, everyone pursues  his  profits,\r\n\r\nenjoys  the fruit of his success, but also bears his own  risks.\r\n\r\nWe  also understand that, to do business in Singapore, you  must\r\n\r\ndepend  on  yourself.  So this survey should be  interpreted  as\r\n\r\nreflecting  the true difficulties faced by the business  people,\r\n\r\nrather  than  attention-seeking sort of \"groaning without  being\r\n\r\nill\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the financial sector is very important.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no doubt about it.  If Singapore can become a  world-class  financial  centre,  then  local  enterprises  will   also\r\n\r\nbenefit.  To a very large extent, multi-national companies  have\r\n\r\ntheir own intra-trading.  I think this has provided some cushion\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore's  economy in this financial  turmoil.   We  also\r\n\r\nconcur with the Government's call for local enterprises to  pool\r\n\r\ntheir  resources  together  to go  into  the  so-called  sunrise\r\n\r\nindustries such as telecommunications, high-tech, logistics  and\r\n\r\ntransportation, and electronic-commerce, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would again appeal to the Government not to neglect\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs  in  Singapore.   They are important  and  special  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  as a nation and Singaporeans as a people.   First  of\r\n\r\nall,  the  small  and medium-sized enterprises,  just  like  the\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies and some large companies such as Yeo\r\n\r\nHiap Seng, are \"our own\". When Singapore is in trouble, they are\r\n\r\nthe people who will remain in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  have  no other places to run to, and they do not  wish  to\r\n\r\nrun.   They  are local indigenous businesses.  The big companies\r\n\r\nalso started off as small companies.  So if we neglect the small\r\n\r\nand   medium-sized  enterprises,  then  you  will  be  doing   a\r\n\r\ndisservice to the entrepreneurial spirit of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, because the SMEs have not reached the economic\r\n\r\nscale,  they are at a disadvantage.  But, of course,  they  also\r\n\r\nhave  the  advantage of being a small boat which  can  manoeuvre\r\n\r\nwith  a lot of flexibility. But, more importantly, they are  the\r\n\r\nsymbol  of  Singaporeans', especially the  young  Singaporeans',\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit.  We have been alarmed that this kind  of\r\n\r\nspirit  is  gradually fading away.  So we cannot  just  pay  lip\r\n\r\nservice  that we encourage entrepreneurial spirit. In  terms  of\r\n\r\npolicy   and   taxes,   Government  should  substantially   give\r\n\r\nreasonable  or long term assistance to these local  enterprises.\r\n\r\nWe  do not expect the Government to over-zealously help them. We\r\n\r\nknow  that  will be quite futile. The Government will  also  not\r\n\r\noblige.   What we are asking the Government to do is to  realise\r\n\r\nthat the SMEs are not fully grown as yet.  They are still in the\r\n\r\nseedling stage.  We must care more for the SMEs.  Because  their\r\n\r\nroots  are  short  and small, the Government should  help  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  grow  faster  by  giving  them  more  water   and\r\n\r\nfertilizer.  Otherwise when the leaves of big trees cover up all\r\n\r\nthe  sunlight and their thick roots obstruct the tiny  roots  of\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs,  even if the latter's seedlings are of good  quality,\r\n\r\nthey  cannot  survive  and will seek better  and  more  friendly\r\n\r\nfields elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some statutory boards published the names of bond\r\n\r\nbreakers.   Although I may not agree with this, from the  debate\r\n\r\non  this matter and my own experiences, I feel that it is  quite\r\n\r\ntrue that the \"me-first\" attitude of the younger generation  has\r\n\r\nreached  the extent that we cannot afford to overlook.  From  my\r\n\r\nown  humble  view,  I  feel  that in  our  economic  development\r\n\r\nprocess,   we  have  over-emphasised  efficiency  and  financial\r\n\r\nbenefits.  This is one of the reasons why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyoung people care more for benefits but less for the spirit.  In\r\n\r\nhelping our SMEs, in terms of transportation cost, it would  not\r\n\r\nbe  enough for us to just talk about economic benefits.  To make\r\n\r\nit  even  clearer, certain things may not be competitive  enough\r\n\r\ntoday. But their values in the long term may be very high. So in\r\n\r\nour   economic   calculation,  we  should  not  under-rate   the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  future value.  The Government's economic  policy\r\n\r\nhas  been  well  founded  and far-reaching.  In  this  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis,  foreign countries have already praised us for  what  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  doing.  It is based on this Government's outstanding\r\n\r\nachievements that I sincerely hope that the Government  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  introduce off-Budget measures to encourage  our  local\r\n\r\nsmall  and  medium enterprises and to lower the  cost  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nask  my  friend  for  some  clarification  on  one  issue?

I am interested  to\r\n\r\nknow,  and probably the House may be interested to know, whether\r\n\r\nthe  views  he has expressed are also the concerns of the  other\r\n\r\nChambers of Commerce?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> The answer to that is yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to him, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.20 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the motion in the name of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the long term is made out of a series of short terms.\r\n\r\nTo  survive  the long term, we need to grow in the  short  term.\r\n\r\nLikewise, to grow in the long term, we need to survive the short\r\n\r\nterm.   In  this  regard, I am very impressed  by  Budget  1998,\r\n\r\nbecause it addresses both the need to survive the short term and\r\n\r\nthe  need  to grow over the long term.  In particular,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to highlight three areas where I am very impressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, during this period of economic slowdown, many\r\n\r\ncompanies are facing problems with cash flow and profitability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  various  measures announced by the Minister to contain  the\r\n\r\nrising cost of doing business in Singapore will go a long way in\r\n\r\nhelping  businesses  to survive the short term.   Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nsmall  and  medium enterprises, together with the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nand  services  sectors, are the key source of  employment.   The\r\n\r\nreview of the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS) is a very\r\n\r\ntimely  move by the Government to support more SMEs during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  of  difficulty.  Thirdly, Asia, in  the  year  2000  and\r\n\r\nbeyond, will be a very different Asia.  By then, many countries,\r\n\r\nif  not  all of them, would have turned around from the  current\r\n\r\nturmoil.  It is very important that Singapore is well positioned\r\n\r\nfor the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I am very impressed by the various\r\n\r\nincentives  and measures announced by the Minister  to  position\r\n\r\nSingapore as a global hub in Asia in the 21st century  in  terms\r\n\r\nof  being  a  financial  hub, exhibition hub,  information  hub,\r\n\r\ntechnology hub, electronic commerce and so on.  So all  in  all,\r\n\r\nas  I say, Budget 1998 is a very good budget and I would like to\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister for coming out with such a good budget\r\n\r\nin such a difficult time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying that we are able to refine better than we\r\n\r\nare  able to create.  Now that the Minister has created  a  very\r\n\r\ngood  budget,  as  a humble MP, I would like to contribute  just\r\n\r\nsome ideas on how this good budget can be refined a little,  for\r\n\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, imagine we have a plane that is normally full. In\r\n\r\nfact,  there are times when we even have to add extra  seats  to\r\n\r\ncater  for  the  over  demand.  All of a sudden,  one  day,  for\r\n\r\nwhatever reason, the passenger load drops, and we end up  having\r\n\r\nmany empty seats.  This is a situation we are not used to.   But\r\n\r\nfor  the airline, when they see all these empty seats coming up,\r\n\r\nthere are a few things they can do.  The first thing they can do\r\n\r\nis  to  lower the fare, make it cheaper so that many people  can\r\n\r\ntravel.  The second thing they can do is to do some promotion to\r\n\r\nattract new passengers, people who have no intention to  fly  on\r\n\r\ntheir  airline  and  bring  them to  their  airline.  The  third\r\n\r\napproach is to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntarget certain special groups and give them special fares, maybe\r\n\r\ntourists,  for example, so that in that way they fill  up  those\r\n\r\nseats.  But why do airlines make all these extra efforts to fill\r\n\r\nup  all  the  empty  seats?  The answer is simple.   Because  if\r\n\r\nnothing is done, by the time the flight is over, the empty seats\r\n\r\nare  gone  forever.  There is no way you can recover  the  empty\r\n\r\nseats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Use a smaller plane.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Low Thia Khiang says, \"use a smaller\r\n\r\nplane\".   I suppose you can.  But the problem is that  later  on\r\n\r\nwhen the business picks up again, what do you do?  Do you change\r\n\r\nback  to  a  bigger plane?  Of course, it costs money to  change\r\n\r\nfrom  a big plane to a small plane.  Therefore, I would like  to\r\n\r\noffer  this  suggestion because whatever we do now under  Budget\r\n\r\n1998,  it  is  quite clear that the economy is  likely  to  grow\r\n\r\nbetween  2.5% and 4.5%.  It can be 2.5% or 4.5%, maybe lower  or\r\n\r\nhigher.   But  whatever it is, I think it is quite safe  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  in  1998  and 1999, we are not going to be able  to  fully\r\n\r\nutilise our full potential because the Singapore economy has the\r\n\r\npotential to grow at 5% to 7% a year.  But this is not likely to\r\n\r\nhappen  in 1998 or 1999.  Therefore the question is: what should\r\n\r\nwe  do with this slack in the national economy?  What should  we\r\n\r\ndo  with  this  spare capacity?  Because, like the  airline,  if\r\n\r\nnothing is done to make full use of this spare capacity, by  the\r\n\r\nyear  2000,  I  think we will look back with  a  lot  of  regret\r\n\r\nbecause what is gone is wasted forever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to put forward this suggestion that there\r\n\r\nare  two  ways we can make use of this spare capacity.   Various\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House have suggested that we should  introduce\r\n\r\nsome stimulation  package to stimulate the economy.  That is one\r\n\r\nway  of  helping the companies to survive, to keep  them  alive,\r\n\r\nkeep  them  above the water, so that hopefully when the  economy\r\n\r\nturns into high growth again, they can move on.  The second  way\r\n\r\nis  to  look at it in a more proactive and constructive way  and\r\n\r\nask  ourselves:  can  we  turn  this  spare  capacity  into   an\r\n\r\ninvestment for the future?  What I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  saying  here  is this.  I am not talking about  giving  more\r\n\r\nincentives  and subsidies to help companies to  survive.   I  am\r\n\r\nproposing that we help companies to become stronger so  that  by\r\n\r\nthe  time the economic crisis is over, companies will  be  in  a\r\n\r\nbetter position to compete in a more competitive Asia.  This  is\r\n\r\ntheory.  This is concept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn this into some concrete ideas. We can turn\r\n\r\nthis  spare capacity into an investment at three levels: at  the\r\n\r\nnational economy, the company and the individual worker's level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, at the national level. We always think that in a\r\n\r\ncrisis  like this, investment will drop and therefore we  should\r\n\r\nexpect fewer investments to come to Singapore, and be ready  for\r\n\r\nthe  hard  time.  I think otherwise.  Recently, I met  a  senior\r\n\r\nexecutive  of a leading MNC of the world and I asked  him,  \"How\r\n\r\nare you doing in Singapore?\"  He said, \"Well, not too bad, quite\r\n\r\ntough  though.  Profit margin is low.  Singapore dollar is  high\r\n\r\nand  therefore  you are more expensive.  But  I  think  we  will\r\n\r\nsurvive.\"   Then I said, \"How about investment  plans?   Do  you\r\n\r\nthink  you  will do something this year?\"  He said, \"Oh,  it  is\r\n\r\ninteresting   that   you   ask  this  question.    Because   our\r\n\r\nheadquarters  just  did a review.  They come to  the  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat  by  the  year 2000 the Asian market will grow  and  expand\r\n\r\nagain.\"   Which  means  they have to do  something  in  1998  to\r\n\r\nprepare  and position themselves for the year 2000.   They  look\r\n\r\naround in Asia.  They concluded that at this moment in 1998, for\r\n\r\ntheir   capital-intensive,   skill-intensive   and   technology-intensive   investments, in fact, there are not many  places  in\r\n\r\nAsia  they  can put their money now.  Because of the uncertainty\r\n\r\nin  the  economy and the political situation, in fact, Singapore\r\n\r\nis  one of the very few countries where they can invest today to\r\n\r\nposition  themselves for the year 2000  And  he  said  that,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  this year they are going to increase their investment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They  are  going to undertake  more  operations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I believe that we can turn this financial crisis\r\n\r\ninto an opportunity for Singapore to move further ahead provided\r\n\r\nthat  we are prepared to set aside more resources to incentivise\r\n\r\nthese investors so that they can do more in Singapore.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  I  would like to suggest that the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nmay  wish  to  consider  allocating a  supplementary  budget  to\r\n\r\neconomic  agencies like the EDB  under the Economic  Development\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme (EDAS) so that agencies like EDB,  TDB,  NCB,\r\n\r\nPSB  and  NSTB  can make use of this slow growth period  in  the\r\n\r\nAsian region to go all out to attract more companies to speed up\r\n\r\ntheir investment into Singapore.  So that by the year 2000  when\r\n\r\nthe  market  returns,  Singapore would be  in  a  much  stronger\r\n\r\nposition to capture this Asian market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the company level. Again, many of us would\r\n\r\nimagine  that  during a period of slowdown, companies  would  be\r\n\r\ntalking  about retrenchment, downsizing, cost-cutting.  I  think\r\n\r\nwe may be 70% right because out of every 10 companies, I am very\r\n\r\noptimistic  that  we can find two to three who are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nlook  ahead to the year 2000 and beyond and ask themselves  what\r\n\r\nthey  can  do  during this period of slowdown with  their  spare\r\n\r\ncapacity  within the company to reposition themselves  to  build\r\n\r\nnew capabilities to compete in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I visited a few companies and, some of them are\r\n\r\nJapanese companies.  They mentioned to me that this is a  period\r\n\r\nwhere  they will focus in three areas.  First, quality;  second,\r\n\r\nproductivity;  and the third area, innovation.  Their  point  is\r\n\r\nthat  by the year 2000, if their operations are going to survive\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, in terms of quality, productivity and innovation,\r\n\r\nthey  must  be so far ahead of their competitors in  the  region\r\n\r\noperating  at  a lower cost location.  During good  times,  they\r\n\r\nhave  no  time  to go through this re-engineering.     But  now,\r\n\r\nduring  a slowdown, time is on their side.  So instead of asking\r\n\r\nworkers  to  stay at home, take a pay cut, they are now  turning\r\n\r\nthis spare capacity into an investment for new capabilities  for\r\n\r\nthe  future.  However, many of them told me that it is easy  for\r\n\r\nthem to secure additional resources from the headquarters during\r\n\r\ngood times to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfund  investment  upgrading.  But during this difficult  period,\r\n\r\nwhen revenue is down, profit is down, it is a big challenge  for\r\n\r\nthe   executives  in  Singapore  to  convince  their   corporate\r\n\r\nheadquarters  to  invest  during this difficult  period.   Their\r\n\r\nsuggestion is, how they wish the Government can do its part  too\r\n\r\nto  co-fund,  to  incentivise them, in some of  these  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in that regard, my second humble suggestion to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance is that I hope the economic agencies  will\r\n\r\nnot  scale  back  their level of incentive support  during  this\r\n\r\ndifficult  period.   Instead, I think they should  increase  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of  support so that companies which are  prepared  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough the process of re-engineering to prepare themselves  for\r\n\r\nthe year 2000 and beyond, should be given more encouragement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, at the individual level, and I think the Minister\r\n\r\nis  aware that this is the level where I am most concerned.  For\r\n\r\nmany years, we have complained that workers are not committed to\r\n\r\ntraining.   Why?   During  good times, they  have  no  time  for\r\n\r\nretraining, because workers would like to work overtime, because\r\n\r\novertime  brings  extra  income to the  workers.   And  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  we can understand.  Now we are in not-so-good  times,\r\n\r\novertime has been cut back.  In fact, quite a few companies  are\r\n\r\nnow  going  on shorter work week where factories open  for  four\r\n\r\ndays, and workers are asked to take compulsory leave and stay at\r\n\r\nhome.   In  a  way,  this spare capacity is  now  being  wasted,\r\n\r\nbecause workers are now staying at home doing nothing.  Here  is\r\n\r\na  situation  whereby during good times, they have no  time  for\r\n\r\ntraining.   Now they have time for training, companies  have  no\r\n\r\nmoney  to  send them for training.  So we are always  caught  in\r\n\r\nthis no-time or no-money situation.  I feel very sad that we are\r\n\r\nnot  taking the bold step to break away from this no-time or no-money situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For companies, many of them, I believe that if we are\r\n\r\nprepared to co-fund training with them, many more employers  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  re-train their workers.  The Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme is spearheaded by the NTUC, co-funded by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDB,  PSB,  and supported by the training facilities offered  by\r\n\r\nITE, Nanyang Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic, and so on.  We\r\n\r\nhave demonstrated that, given a sufficient level of support, the\r\n\r\nemployers  are  prepared to retrain their  workers  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  of  slowdown.  And many workers, the older workers,  the\r\n\r\nnot-so-young  workers, the under-educated workers, are  prepared\r\n\r\nto respond to training.  Under the SRP today, more than half the\r\n\r\nworkers  are more than 40 years old, and more than  70%  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  undergoing  training  have  less  than  secondary   two\r\n\r\nqualification.   We  believe that, if given  sufficient  funding\r\n\r\nsupport,  we  can expand the SRP to beyond the unionised  sector\r\n\r\ninto  a  national programme, so that we can turn this period  of\r\n\r\nslowdown  into a period for investment, retraining,  and  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  the  workers, so that  our  workers  will  remain\r\n\r\nemployable in the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are my three suggestions which I hope the\r\n\r\nMinister  will consider.  But having said all this, I think,  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the day, whether Singapore would do  well  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  depends not so much on how much money we have, how  good\r\n\r\nis  our  strategy,  but  on  what kind  of  people  we  have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, what kind of Singaporeans we have in Singapore,  what\r\n\r\nkind of leaders we have in Singapore in the future.  And here  I\r\n\r\nam  not  talking  about  leaders  who  have  the  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nexpertise.   I  think  equally, if not more important,  we  need\r\n\r\nleaders  with the right value system.  In that regard,  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on the scholarship is a very relevant issue  within\r\n\r\nthe  context  of Budget 1998.  Because if the young  leaders  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  leadership  of  the  future,  have  only   good\r\n\r\nknowledge  but  not  the  right value system,  I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nSingapore can sustain our growth in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members here mentioned that we must invest in the\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans, in the citizens of the future, and I  fully\r\n\r\nendorse  this.   I would like to cite Chairman, EDB,  Mr  Philip\r\n\r\nYeo,  as an example of a person who really believes in investing\r\n\r\nin  the  young  Singaporeans.  I must at this stage  declare  my\r\n\r\ninterest.  Firstly, I am the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  National  Computer  Board  (one  of  the  two\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  that  is  involved  in  this  whole   issue);\r\n\r\nsecondly,  I was MD of EDB, and I am now still on the  Board  of\r\n\r\nEDB; and thirdly, I am a scholar, and I have been bonded to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for 11 years, and I am proud to say I am not a  bond-breaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Philip Yeo believes in developing the\r\n\r\ntalents for the future.  So wherever he goes, he makes sure that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a scholarship system in place to invest in the  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  In 1981, when he became Chairman, NCB, he set  up\r\n\r\nthe  NCB scholarship.  In 1986, when he became Chairman, EDB,  I\r\n\r\nthink  not many people are aware, he secured a $50 million  fund\r\n\r\nfrom  Glaxo to set up the Glaxo-EDB scholarship.  When he became\r\n\r\nChairman,   Sembawang,  again,  he  expanded   the   scholarship\r\n\r\nprogramme.   Why?   Because he believes that  for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nsustain  our  growth in the future, we need to have young,  good\r\n\r\nand  capable  leaders.   To have good leaders,  he  believes  in\r\n\r\ngiving them the best education you can find in this world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight this. For a long time, the Government has\r\n\r\na  lot  of  reservations about sending scholars to  America  for\r\n\r\nstudy  and allowing scholars to go beyond the basic degree.   Mr\r\n\r\nPhilip  Yeo  changed all that.  He was the first  to  allow  NCB\r\n\r\nscholars to study in US, to do Masters, and likewise, in EDB, in\r\n\r\nSembawang.  Why?  Because his belief is that you must give  them\r\n\r\nthe  best.  If the best is in USA, let them go to USA.  When  he\r\n\r\nbecame Chairman of Sembawang, I was told that some of the  staff\r\n\r\nasked  him:  why  are you giving all this money to  scholars  to\r\n\r\nbenefit just a few persons?  And he explained that the future of\r\n\r\na  good  corporation  depends on having good  leaders,  but,  in\r\n\r\nreturn, he would expect a lot from the scholars.  I was told - I\r\n\r\nwas  not there - that once he met up with Sembawang scholars and\r\n\r\nhe  told them, \"I hope everyone of you will remember - that this\r\n\r\nscholarship  money  is not my money; it  is  not  the  money  of\r\n\r\nSembawang  management; it is not the money of the  shareholders,\r\n\r\nbut this is the workers' money.\"  Because as the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChairman   of  Sembawang,  he  could  have  declared  all   this\r\n\r\nscholarship money as bonuses and wage increase for the  workers.\r\n\r\nBut  because he is looking ahead to the future, that is  why  he\r\n\r\nputs  the money to fund scholarships.  And he told the scholars,\r\n\r\n\"I  hope  everyone of you will appreciate that  the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSembawang  are funding your education.  I hope you do your  very\r\n\r\nbest  when  you go to school.  And I hope that by the  time  you\r\n\r\ngraduate from school, you will come back to repay these  workers\r\n\r\nof Sembawang by giving your very best to Sembawang Corporation.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think what he said to the Sembawang scholars is\r\n\r\nequally applicable, whether it is at a statutory board level  or\r\n\r\nat  the national level.  Yes, we have bond-breakers.  But we are\r\n\r\nnot talking about the same kind of bond-breakers.  Mr Leong Horn\r\n\r\nKee  mentioned that he served 10 years before he broke his bond.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing wrong with that, because he served 10  years.\r\n\r\nAfter  breaking his bond, he is still contributing to Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut what we are talking about here are scholars who did not even\r\n\r\nserve  one day and who decided to break their bonds.  Of course,\r\n\r\nmany  will  argue  that after five years, 10  years,  they  will\r\n\r\nreturn  to  be  better persons.  Time will tell.   But  at  this\r\n\r\nmoment, in 1998, if we look back at what happened the last  five\r\n\r\nto  15  years, under NCB, six scholars broke their bonds without\r\n\r\nserving a single day.  And at this moment, out of the six,  only\r\n\r\none is serving in Singapore.  The other five are now in USA.  At\r\n\r\nleast  one of them has already sunk roots in USA.  He has got  a\r\n\r\ngood job, a good family, and he has no intention to return.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the point here is this. It is like what Mr Philip Yeo\r\n\r\ntold the Sembawang scholars: this is the workers' money.  And I,\r\n\r\nas  a  labour  MP,  would  like to tell all  the  public  sector\r\n\r\nscholars  the same thing: that every single cent that goes  into\r\n\r\nscholarships  belongs  to  the taxpayers,  to  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and, therefore, when they take on a  scholarship,  I\r\n\r\nhope  somewhere  in  their heart they  remember  that  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  a  statutory board gives them a  scholarship  to\r\n\r\ncreate a better future for themselves, they will in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreturn think about how they can create a better future for   the\r\n\r\naverage Singaporeans, for the common Singaporeans of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Budget  Statement presented by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, Dr Richard Hu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after this year's Budget Statement was delivered\r\n\r\non  27th  February 1998, a Member of this House remarked  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  he  wished he was working in the financial  sector.   This\r\n\r\nsummarises a commonplace perception that this year's  Budget  is\r\n\r\nprimarily  aimed  at bolstering the financial  sector.   Perhaps\r\n\r\ngiven  the  economic  downturn and  the  difficulties  faced  by\r\n\r\ncertain financial sector players, this emphasis on the financial\r\n\r\nsector  is  understandable.  But the economic  downturn  is  not\r\n\r\nrestricted  only  to the financial sector.   Hence  there  is  a\r\n\r\nperception that the Budget does not go far enough to help  other\r\n\r\nsectors of the economy and the ordinary man.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to express my concern here, especially\r\n\r\nfor  small  and medium-sized companies.  The move to expand  the\r\n\r\nscope  and range of the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS)\r\n\r\nis indeed welcome, given the credit squeeze companies are facing\r\n\r\ntoday.   Companies  benefiting from this scheme  are  invariably\r\n\r\nsmall  or  medium  sized.  However, some have expressed  concern\r\n\r\nthat  the smaller SMEs may also be \"squeezed\" out by larger SMEs\r\n\r\nwho  are  expected to enjoy the lion's share of the benefits  of\r\n\r\nthis new initiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to ensure that all deserving\r\n\r\ncompanies are able to enjoy this scheme without regard to  their\r\n\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I spoke about the need to encourage SMEs to\r\n\r\nundertake  research  and development  work.   I  wonder  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  could  enlighten the House on  the  successes  of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes  undertaken  by PSB to help SMEs  grow  and  develop.\r\n\r\nSuch successes would show that these programmes can assist these\r\n\r\ncompanies in building their core capabilities and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeveloping  adequate in-house expertise that will help  them  to\r\n\r\nride out the economic crisis that may hit us this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same point, Sir, I am somewhat disappointed that\r\n\r\nthere are no special provisions in the Budget to assist SMEs  to\r\n\r\nbecome more competitive.  I understand that the LEFS scheme is a\r\n\r\nuseful device to help companies continue their operations.  This\r\n\r\nis  important.   But can we do more to help these  companies  to\r\n\r\ngrow and develop core capabilities?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the view of the Finance Minister that the role\r\n\r\nof  government  is  to  ensure  that  good  business  conditions\r\n\r\nprevail.  Given the current regional economic crisis, shaping up\r\n\r\nconfidence internationally and domestically has become  all  the\r\n\r\nmore  important.  Yet it may appear to some SMEs that confidence\r\n\r\ndomestically does not seem to come their way.  For any  SME,  an\r\n\r\ninvestment into a new product or service is a major undertaking.\r\n\r\nIn this time of uncertainty, they would be cautious as any wrong\r\n\r\nmove may wipe out their entire operations.  While we do not want\r\n\r\nSMEs to go into bad investments, we also do not want them to  be\r\n\r\noverly  cautious.  An undue fear of risk ultimately may  not  be\r\n\r\ngood  for  their continued good and development.  The Government\r\n\r\nis in a good position to assist SMEs in this area and to bolster\r\n\r\nconfidence  in their potential.  I share what Mr  Lim  has  just\r\n\r\nspoken.   Sir, can the Government consider increasing  funds  to\r\n\r\nthe SMEs to allow them to invest in new areas so as to stimulate\r\n\r\nthe economy?  I am not advocating corporate welfarism.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nwe  could  consider  an  arrangement where  both  the  SMEs  and\r\n\r\nGovernment share the risk in new areas of investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as noted by the Minister, small companies still\r\n\r\nlag  behind in the area of worker training.  I hope  we  can  do\r\n\r\nsomething  to  ensure that SMEs do not lag behind even  further.\r\n\r\nWe must not allow some SMEs to dismiss as a hollow platitude the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   view   that  during  this   period,   we   should\r\n\r\nconsolidate,  build up our core capabilities and strengthen  our\r\n\r\nfundamentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the role of Government to ensure that confidence in\r\n\r\nthe economy and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket  place  is restored quickly.  Everyone and not  just  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community must feel confident.  I  agree  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  for  the  people to support and have  faith  in  this\r\n\r\nGovernment's  ability  to  govern  and  to  protect,  especially\r\n\r\npeople's  livelihoods.   But how do we achieve  this  with  this\r\n\r\nBudget?   How, to borrow a term from Admiral Teo, do  we  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  people sector can ride out the coming storm and  come\r\n\r\nout of it better off than they were before?  What can Government\r\n\r\ndo  to  encourage optimism, strengthen resilience,  and  promote\r\n\r\nstrong work ethos among the people in this difficult time?   The\r\n\r\nlast thing we want is for the people to throw in the towel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial incentives to encourage workers to train are one\r\n\r\ngood  way.  The ordinary worker, however, may feel hard  pressed\r\n\r\nto  go  for two or more jobs during this period instead of going\r\n\r\nfor  some training programme.  Training programmes for some will\r\n\r\nbe  at best a difficult option with uncertain payoffs.  And what\r\n\r\nabout people who do not require training?  What about people who\r\n\r\nstay  put  in their job and help their companies to grow?   What\r\n\r\nabout those who choose not to migrate but instead decide to hang\r\n\r\nin here with all of us?  What can we do for these people?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do agree that we must all realise that things will\r\n\r\nbe difficult this year.  But the Government can do little things\r\n\r\nto  calm  our  financial jitters and to allow  us  to  face  the\r\n\r\nexpected  difficult  time in a stronger psychological  state  of\r\n\r\nmind.   Can  we  consider,  for  example,  increasing  childcare\r\n\r\nsubsidies  so that working parents can concentrate  on  doing  a\r\n\r\ngood job at their work place?  Can we not delay the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  maid levy?  I am sure we can find other ways to bolster the\r\n\r\nstaying power of our fellow Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Government's move to continue investing\r\n\r\nin  the  young.  I see there are many students in the Strangers'\r\n\r\nGallery.  Spending on education will not be reduced despite  the\r\n\r\neconomic uncertainty.  This emphasis on the continued importance\r\n\r\nof human resources is the right signal to send to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, measures must also be introduced to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  protect our young from unhealthy addictive  habits\r\n\r\nsuch  as  smoking.  I am glad to note that duties on  cigarettes\r\n\r\nwill be increased in line with our national policy to discourage\r\n\r\nsmoking, especially among the young.  Sir, I would encourage the\r\n\r\nGovernment to increase the duties even further.  Despite all the\r\n\r\ncampaigning to discourage smoking, anecdotal evidence shows that\r\n\r\nit is on the rise.  All in all, smoking is something we can have\r\n\r\nless  of  and  even  possibly eradicate from Singapore.   But  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  Singapore  being a  cosmopolitan  society  and\r\n\r\nwanting  to  attract  foreign talent  must  be  careful  not  to\r\n\r\nunnecessarily    alarm    people   with   draconian    measures.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,  Sir,  I  would support any  further  increases  in\r\n\r\nduties  on  cigarettes  if it helps to protect  our  young  from\r\n\r\nwasting  their  health and damaging their  future.   The  income\r\n\r\nearned  from  such duties could be put to good use,  perhaps  in\r\n\r\nsome of the areas I have mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the move to continue giving rebates on HDB service and\r\n\r\nconservancy charges and rentals to citizens is indeed welcome by\r\n\r\nmany.   I noted some unhappiness among citizens living in 5-room\r\n\r\nflats  as  to  why they have been left out.  Given  the  current\r\n\r\neconomic  difficulties, they too would feel the pinch.  However,\r\n\r\nI am sure they would understand that these measures are meant to\r\n\r\nhelp citizens in certain income brackets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, a group of people which I am concerned\r\n\r\nabout.   These  are the very poor, perhaps destitute  who  often\r\n\r\nhave  no social networks to rely upon.  Some, I believe, are  on\r\n\r\npublic  assistance.   The full impact of the  regional  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  could lead to price increases.  In this regard, I wonder\r\n\r\nif this group of people would not be affected.  I would urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to consider increasing the public assistance  amount\r\n\r\nto  this  group  of  people.  It would  show  that  despite  our\r\n\r\ndifficulties, this Government does care for those who are really\r\n\r\nin need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the week after the Budget was announced, I came across\r\n\r\ntwo groups of people wanting to see me during my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeet-the-people  session.   The first  was  a  group  of  people\r\n\r\nrunning small businesses at HDB shops and the other was a family\r\n\r\nrunning  a  stall  at a wet market.  The former was  complaining\r\n\r\nabout  fines  levied  on  them for displaying  items  along  the\r\n\r\ncorridors fronting their shops.  They complained bitterly  about\r\n\r\npoor  business and how it was difficult to make ends meet.   The\r\n\r\nlatter  group wanted to give back their stall to HDB due to  bad\r\n\r\nbusiness.   Bad  or slow business seems to be a recurring  theme\r\n\r\nwhenever  I  do  my market visits.  I know that all  businessmen\r\n\r\ncomplain  of bad business even in good times.  It is a  business\r\n\r\nstrategy to evoke sympathy from potential customers.  But  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  sure that given the current regional economic crisis, their\r\n\r\ncomplaints are merely strategic hyperbole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our petty traders are feeling the pinch. They do not make\r\n\r\na lot of sales, yet their business costs seem to be high.  In my\r\n\r\narea  several stalls have closed down.  We need to do  something\r\n\r\nfor  these people.  I would urge the Government to consider some\r\n\r\nhelp for these people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am tempted to appeal to the Government to consider a\r\n\r\nbalanced budget.  Many in this House have spoken about the  need\r\n\r\nto stimulate the economy.  However, it is also good to have that\r\n\r\nsmall  budget  surplus for this coming year.   The  Minster  has\r\n\r\nassured  us that off-Budget measures will be considered  if  the\r\n\r\nsituation  warrants  it.   In this instance,  the  surplus  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely come in handy.  On the other hand, using part of  the\r\n\r\nsurplus to assist companies to grow and develop, as well  as  to\r\n\r\nhelp  families  tide over their finances during  this  difficult\r\n\r\nperiod,  is  an  investment in a better  future  for  all.   The\r\n\r\nquestion is how much of the surplus to use now or later.  If  we\r\n\r\nuse  all of it now and things get worse, we may end up facing  a\r\n\r\nnegative growth with no surplus to fall back on.  If we  tighten\r\n\r\nour  belts  too much, we may end up with heavy pockets  but  the\r\n\r\neconomic  flu  may  turn to pneumonia.  We  need  to  avoid  the\r\n\r\ntemptation  of  emptying  out our  pockets,  but  we  must  take\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  stimulate the economy so that we  are  in  a  good\r\n\r\nposition to strike at the next economic boom.  I support the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverall  thrust  of  the Budget, but I urge  the  Government  to\r\n\r\naddress some of the concerns I have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  in support of the motion.  Sir, a few days ago,  I  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  think of what to speak in this debate.  Actually,  I\r\n\r\nwas  thinking  whether I should speak on the tax incentives  for\r\n\r\nthe  bond market.  But, Sir, given the fact that the bond  issue\r\n\r\nhas  changed quite somewhat, I thought I would leave  it  to  my\r\n\r\nmore learned, able and articulate colleagues to talk about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my first reaction to the Budget was that it was a good\r\n\r\nBudget  against the backdrop of our uncertain regional  climate,\r\n\r\nthe  storm  that  is looming, the gloom and  doom.   The  modest\r\n\r\nsurplus  budget, to me, was just as pro-business as it was  pro-worker.   If it is pro-business, then obviously it must be  pro-worker.  But there are gaps, in fact, some big gaps in the sense\r\n\r\nthat  it is not pro-worker because it is not addressing the plea\r\n\r\nto  increase funding for skills upgrading of workers and  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  so  pro-business in the sense that not much help  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  SMEs other than the enhanced LEFS scheme and  nothing\r\n\r\nmuch  has  been done for manufacturing companies.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nSir, the Budget is a people's budget in the sense that there was\r\n\r\nsomething  for  everyone.  And here, I was quite surprised  when\r\n\r\nthe  Straits  Times  the  next day said something  like  \"Dr  Hu\r\n\r\nunveils  a  prudent Budget\", implying as if the previous  years'\r\n\r\nBudgets were not prudent.  As far as I have been in this  House,\r\n\r\nevery  year  it  has  been a prudent Budget. Anyway,  Sir,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, given the current economic situation, do not count\r\n\r\nthe  blessings of a reasonably good budget in bad  times.   They\r\n\r\nforgot that the Indonesians, Thais and Malaysians are not having\r\n\r\nit  as good, and they will never have as good a budget for  some\r\n\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to some of my friends when I got home two Fridays\r\n\r\nago.   First, I spoke to a fellow unionist, a university  hostel\r\n\r\nfriend who works in a bank, and to some other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfriends from the corporate world.  The unionist told me that  he\r\n\r\nwas  somewhat  disappointed with the Budget.  He said  that  the\r\n\r\nBudget was not good because the income tax rebate was only 5%, a\r\n\r\nreduction  from  10%  the  previous  year.   Then  I  asked  him\r\n\r\ncuriously whether he pays income tax.  He grinned and said  that\r\n\r\nhe  did not pay income tax, but was just reflecting the views of\r\n\r\nwhat  his  manager  at his workplace had told him  over  coffee.\r\n\r\nMost  Singaporeans, Sir, are second-hand complainers!  They  are\r\n\r\njust  gracious  enough to complain on others'  behalf  and  lend\r\n\r\nempathy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, this friend went on to a more substantive reason as\r\n\r\nto  why he was disappointed with the Budget this year.  He  said\r\n\r\nthat  instead of giving a big financial boost to the efforts  of\r\n\r\nNTUC  in skills upgrading, the Government had chosen to say that\r\n\r\nit  wanted companies to spend on training like the way it  spent\r\n\r\non  education of our young, our school children.  His point  was\r\n\r\nthat  while  it  was correct to ask companies to spend  more  on\r\n\r\ntraining  and  upgrading  the skills of our  workforce,  without\r\n\r\nstrong financial incentives from the Government, it is going  to\r\n\r\nbe  foolhardy  to ask companies, especially small companies  and\r\n\r\nlocal  enterprises, to spend more on training.  For  most  SMEs,\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity costs of training their workers, both in  terms\r\n\r\nof  time  away from work and the costs relating to  payroll  and\r\n\r\ntraining, can be very significant and Mr Lim Swee Say has spoken\r\n\r\neloquently  about  it.  It also means that the  small  companies\r\n\r\ncannot  meet  their production schedules on a daily  basis.   If\r\n\r\nthey cannot meet the production schedules on a daily basis, what\r\n\r\nit  means  is that their companies would be rendered financially\r\n\r\nnot  viable  both in the short term and in the long  term.   And\r\n\r\nespecially in times like this, the consideration of the CEOs  in\r\n\r\nSMEs is business survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless and until Government starts to spend as much on our\r\n\r\nworkforce  as it does on our school children, it is the  workers\r\n\r\nof  Signapore, especially the workers in our SMEs who are  going\r\n\r\nto suffer and face the future consequences of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment.  While my fellow unionist agrees  with\r\n\r\nDr  Hu  that `nobody can expect lifelong job security', he feels\r\n\r\nstrongly that many under-educated workers in Singapore  had  for\r\n\r\nvarious reasons lost out on a basic education.  He wants to  ask\r\n\r\nGovernment to play an active role to help provide the funds  for\r\n\r\nthem  \"to learn how to fish for they cannot just depend on their\r\n\r\ncompanies to provide their fish for a life time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my own response to this call by my fellow unionist is\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  right  to ask the Government for  more  money  for\r\n\r\nworkers'  skills upgrading but, at the same time,  I  feel  that\r\n\r\ncompanies   cannot  shirk  their  responsibilities   in   worker\r\n\r\ntraining.   I think the Government can encourage SMEs  to  spend\r\n\r\nmore  on  training  by  taking a lead in the  same  way  it  has\r\n\r\ndeveloped  financial  incentives as  a  catalyst  for  SMEs  for\r\n\r\nbusiness upgrading activities.  Sir, for example, the Government\r\n\r\nused to bear up to 90% of the financial costs if SMEs embark on,\r\n\r\nsay, ISO 9002 consultancy.  This encouraged SMEs to venture into\r\n\r\nsuch business consultancies.  When this attracted many SMEs, the\r\n\r\nGovernment gradually lowered the percentage subsidy, I  believe,\r\n\r\nto  70%.  Likewise, the Government should entice companies  into\r\n\r\ntraining  their  own workforce.  Already, such an  incentive  on\r\n\r\ntraining and payroll costs exists in the scheme initiated by the\r\n\r\nNTUC  - the Skills Redevelopment Programme.  What the Government\r\n\r\nneeds  to  do is to elevate it to a national scheme, as  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nSwee Say has pointed out, so that more funding will be available\r\n\r\nto training and more SMEs can be encouraged to join the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then there was this other friend that I spoke to who\r\n\r\nhelps  the Handicapped Welfare Association.  He told me that  it\r\n\r\nis  time  that  Government increased handicapped  earned  income\r\n\r\nrelief  given  the fact that the costs of living  have  actually\r\n\r\nincreased for the handicapped, especially for those who need  to\r\n\r\nemploy  a maid to look after them or those handicapped who  need\r\n\r\nto  own  vehicles as they  are unable to take public  transport.\r\n\r\nHe  suggested that the maid levy can be reduced for this special\r\n\r\ngroup and on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is felt that the $3,500 tax relief is insufficient to pay for\r\n\r\nthe  maid levy and her salary.  On Sunday morning, I flagged off\r\n\r\na  Handicapped Welfare Association's \"Wheel, Walk or Jog\" event,\r\n\r\nand  many  in  the Association have made a plea and  sent  me  a\r\n\r\ndetailed  proposal which I will be happy to pass  it  on  to  Dr\r\n\r\nRichard Hu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was another friend who had always felt that it\r\n\r\nwas  time  that  the Government listened to some  feedback  from\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans.   He had attended the Institute  of  Policy\r\n\r\nStudies  (IPS) Young Singaporeans Conference last  October.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  too was invited to attend one of the feedback sessions\r\n\r\ntogether  with  some  of the younger MPs  in  this  House.   The\r\n\r\nparticipants  included some 50 very bright and  upwardly  mobile\r\n\r\nyounger  Singaporeans holding key positions both in the  private\r\n\r\nand public sectors, and they were all largely in their 30s.   My\r\n\r\nfriend  reminded me that the conference had brought out a strong\r\n\r\nmessage  that  young  Singaporeans like  them  wished  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  moved  away  from  the preoccupation  with  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and development as the predominant basis of all national\r\n\r\nactivity and sense of nationhood.  I asked him what had that got\r\n\r\nto do with the Budget Statement.  Sir, before you rule me out of\r\n\r\norder, his response was that these were fundamental issues  that\r\n\r\npublic  policy  makers had to reconcile before  public  policies\r\n\r\ntook root through the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have recently received from the IPS a summary of the\r\n\r\ndeliberations and I think it is worthy for me to highlight  some\r\n\r\nof  their thoughts for the Government to consider.  It was  felt\r\n\r\nthat if the country would become solely a function of `making  a\r\n\r\nliving',  then the nation would lose its function the  moment  a\r\n\r\nbetter  living can be gained elsewhere.  Economic  logic  is  no\r\n\r\nrespector  of  national  loyalties.  A sole  preoccupation  with\r\n\r\neconomics as a basis for nationhood could even undermine  it  in\r\n\r\nthe long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it was acknowledged that economic progress was a\r\n\r\nnecessary  component  for  nationhood  and  social  cohesion  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  more  should  be done to strengthen  the  intangible\r\n\r\nsense of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizenship  and belonging.  A sense of attachment to  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  hinge on the citizens' sense of fulfilment of their lives\r\n\r\nhere.   Some  participants  bemoaned  the  fact  that  life  was\r\n\r\nstressful  and  driven  mainly by  the  need  to  `pour  on  the\r\n\r\nconcrete'  with little or no time to `smell the  roses'.   There\r\n\r\nseemed  to be a trade-off between productivity and leisure.   It\r\n\r\nwas  felt that just like productivity, indicators of quality  of\r\n\r\nlife  need  to be introduced in Singapore.  Some felt  that  the\r\n\r\nstresses  and strains that the middle class subjected themselves\r\n\r\nto, to attain their material `lifestyle' aspirations were pegged\r\n\r\nto  the  patterns of consumption of the developed nations rather\r\n\r\nthan to the small resource poor city-state of Singapore.  Hence,\r\n\r\n\"the  pressure is about how to increase comparative  consumption\r\n\r\nadvantage over one's neighbours.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although not explicitly stated in the conference, the\r\n\r\nnew  policy to attract foreign talent into the economy must have\r\n\r\nprovided  a  question posed at the conference, ie, \"is  there  a\r\n\r\ndifference between a Singapore citizen and a permanent resident?\r\n\r\nIf  the  difference is negligible, should we then just privatise\r\n\r\ncitizenship?\"  If it were perceived that some of the  privileges\r\n\r\nof  citizenship  could  be  had for one's  contribution  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  and  gain what a speaker referred to  as  `value-added\r\n\r\ncitizenship',  it  would  not  be a  large  step  to  eventually\r\n\r\ncommodifying citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was felt that there was now a sense of cognitive\r\n\r\ndissonance  over the Government's discourse on  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\ncorporation  and  Singapore  as a  nation  state.   The  current\r\n\r\nforeign  talent policy has sent the signal that citizenship  was\r\n\r\nvalued   by  the  nation  state  according  to  one's   economic\r\n\r\ncontribution,  but  yet the demand on the Singaporean  has  been\r\n\r\nthat  he  or  she  should relate to the  nation  state  with  an\r\n\r\nemotional  sense  of attachment.  So this issue  of  scholarship\r\n\r\nbond is only symptomatic of a bigger problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote another person at the forum and he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What we suffer from is a contradiction in roles and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  ..   If  you  look  at  it  from  a  country's\r\n\r\nperspective, issues that you need to consider are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunlike  those  of a company's perspective. . From the  company's\r\n\r\nperspective,  it is up to the employee to upgrade himself.   [Of\r\n\r\ncourse,   with  some  Government  help.]   From  the   country's\r\n\r\nperspective,  we expect the country to upgrade  us  to  be  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  If Singapore Inc. were to go to the extreme, there\r\n\r\nmay  be  [social] fallout, people structurally unemployed  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of cost-benefit analysis.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was also a need to remember that what may prove\r\n\r\nto  be  valuable  in building a nation and in explaining  how  a\r\n\r\nsociety  functioned  could  not be priced  or  quantified.   The\r\n\r\norientation  towards  an  economic cost-benefit  analysis  or  a\r\n\r\nmanagerial approach to governance would overlook these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other principle to consider, therefore, as we seek to\r\n\r\ntruly  release  new  energies  for  our  thrust  into  the   new\r\n\r\nmillennium  could  be  to  choose total,  holistic,  system-wide\r\n\r\nsolutions over piecemeal sub-optimal ones.  This must begin with\r\n\r\na  rigorous intellectual review of governance and public  policy\r\n\r\nin Singapore today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to my philosophical friend, I asked him\r\n\r\nthat  given this gloom and doom, is there any public policy that\r\n\r\nthe  Government can review to show that it cares  more  for  the\r\n\r\nyoung   Singapore  professionals  vis-a-vis  attracting  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  from  elsewhere?  He said, \"I can think of  one  thing.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  pointing  to me, he said, \"and you had spoken  passionately\r\n\r\nabout it in Parliament two years ago.\"  He was talking about  my\r\n\r\nspeech two budgets ago about young professionals' aspirations to\r\n\r\nown a landed property or private condominium and their dream  to\r\n\r\nown was slipping away from them.  He felt that this was the time\r\n\r\nwhen  property prices have come to a halt, but prices are  still\r\n\r\nhigh.  They are still at the 1995 price levels.  He felt that if\r\n\r\nthe Government is serious about creating a national identity for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to be rooted to this soil, then this  is  the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  they can help upwardly-mobile young Singaporeans to   sink\r\n\r\ntheir  roots  here.   And he was quick to add  that  he  had  no\r\n\r\npecuniary  interest  as  he  was  already  living  in  a  landed\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he felt that the Government can meet the\r\n\r\naspirations of these young professionals, instead of  trying  to\r\n\r\nattract foreign talent, by relaxing the 20% cash downpayment for\r\n\r\nthe  purchase of private property to, say, 10%.  This is because\r\n\r\nmany young professionals do not have much cash.  They have a lot\r\n\r\nof  assets, but, very often, it is not in cash.  This is a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the  market is soft that good buys can be  made.   Waiting\r\n\r\nfor another two to three years will enable them to save and have\r\n\r\nmore cash, but the market will unfortunately catch up with them.\r\n\r\nIf  the Government does this by reducing the 20% downpayment  to\r\n\r\n10%,  it  will not only win the hearts and minds of these  young\r\n\r\nprofessionals to go beyond Singapore Inc to feel for the country\r\n\r\nand  to sink their roots here, but it will also, as a byproduct,\r\n\r\nhelp  breathe some life into the market, though personally I  do\r\n\r\nnot  like to speak for property developers.  But that is another\r\n\r\nstory!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end my speech by wrapping up the view of my\r\n\r\nfriends  with  a simple story that you might have heard  before,\r\n\r\nthe  story of the Elephant and the Six Blind Men.  Once  upon  a\r\n\r\ntime,  there  were  six blind men who wanted  to  know  what  an\r\n\r\nelephant  looked  like.   They  wanted  to  learn  by  feel  and\r\n\r\nexperience  and satisfy their mind as to what an  elephant  was.\r\n\r\nSo  an  elephant was brought to them.  Mr Lim Swee Say is  here.\r\n\r\nHe likes to hear jokes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first blind man, who stood near the broad and sturdy\r\n\r\nside  of  the elephant, said that the elephant was like a  wall.\r\n\r\nThe  second  blind man felt the tusk and said that the  elephant\r\n\r\nwas  like  a spear.  The third felt the trunk and said that  the\r\n\r\nelephant was like a snake.  The fourth man touched its  leg  and\r\n\r\nknee and said that the elephant was like a tree.  The fifth  man\r\n\r\ntouched  the ear and said that the elephant was like a big  fan.\r\n\r\nThe  sixth  blind man touched the tail and proclaimed  that  the\r\n\r\nelephant was like a rope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the moral of the story is this. Like the blind men,\r\n\r\nmy friends are relating only the aspects of the Budget Statement\r\n\r\nthat  affect them from their personal perspective.  Other things\r\n\r\nare not relevant to them and do not seem to matter and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore  their  perspective may be somewhat myopic,  from  the\r\n\r\nperspective  of a person with a clear vision to see  the  entire\r\n\r\nelephant.   But  their  perspectives  are  not  wrong  but  just\r\n\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Richard Hu and the Government have a clear vision and\r\n\r\ncan  see  the  big  picture of the elephant,  ie,  the  holistic\r\n\r\npicture of the country and they have come up with a budget  that\r\n\r\nhas  something, however small, for everyone.  While it  may  not\r\n\r\nsatisfy any one more than the other, it is the right vision  for\r\n\r\nSingapore given the regional backdrop.  It is a cautious  budget\r\n\r\nand  rightly so.  But, as Dr Richard Hu has said on TV on Budget\r\n\r\nnight,  the  Government can still make a  number  of  off-Budget\r\n\r\npronouncements  when the course of the sail becomes  calmer  and\r\n\r\nless  choppy.   And  I hope that the Government  will  give  due\r\n\r\nconsideration to some of the perspectives of the `blind men' who\r\n\r\nmay  have something to add to the big picture.  The blind,  such\r\n\r\nas  those  in  my  anecdote, have other sensitivities  that  are\r\n\r\nheightened, such as the sense of touch and the aural sense.  For\r\n\r\nthose of us who can see, but only from our limited perspectives,\r\n\r\nit  might  be wise for us to listen and reach out to those  with\r\n\r\nheightened   sensitivities  and  needs,  whom  we   might   have\r\n\r\noverlooked and not heard diligently enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Although the situation\r\n\r\nhas  somewhat  stabilized,  stock markets  and  currencies  have\r\n\r\ncollapsed  and there is no sign that recovery is in  sight.   We\r\n\r\nare   quite  apprehensive  about  what  is  happening   in   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries.  I believe Members have read  from  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers that in certain countries tens of millions of  people\r\n\r\nhave  lost their jobs.  The loss of jobs also means the loss  of\r\n\r\nincomes.  Furthermore, there is no social welfare system to take\r\n\r\ncare of them.  The depreciation in their currencies coupled with\r\n\r\ntwo-digit   inflation  could  only  cause   the   situation   to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate further.  This situation will remind elderly  people\r\n\r\nof  the days in the 50s and 60s when there was high unemployment\r\n\r\nand  inflation.   We  hope international  financial  authorities\r\n\r\nwould give a helping hand to these countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been spared this financial and currency\r\n\r\nturmoil.   Many  Singaporeans are confident about  their  future\r\n\r\nbecause  we have a strong foundation.  Though affected  by  this\r\n\r\nregional crisis, we have been able to withstand it.  Why  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  when  our  neighbouring countries are going  through  such\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis we come out unscathed?  Singaporeans  ought  to\r\n\r\nponder  over  this matter.  In the last few years  our  regional\r\n\r\neconomic  situation  has been good.  We have  surpluses  in  our\r\n\r\nbudgets.  Many people were rather critical about such surpluses.\r\n\r\nHad  it not been for the surpluses we have accumulated over  the\r\n\r\npast  few  years  we would not have been able  to  maintain  our\r\n\r\ncurrency  value.  That we are able to keep our Singapore  dollar\r\n\r\nstrong  is  due  to the fact that we have massive  surpluses  to\r\n\r\nsupport us.  We do not have natural resources, for example,  oil\r\n\r\nor  timber.  We cannot support our currency with oil or  timber.\r\n\r\nThis goes to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow  that  our Government is correct in accumulating surpluses.\r\n\r\nPerhaps now is the time to use some of the surpluses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 10 years our Finance Minister has worked very\r\n\r\nhard  to  give us prudent budgets year after year.  The regional\r\n\r\nfinancial turmoil has taught us a few lessons.  That is  why  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  able  political leadership  and  a  sound  political\r\n\r\nstructure.   Economic and social development should go  hand  in\r\n\r\nhand.   The  crisis has also put our stamina and mettle  to  the\r\n\r\nseverest  test  in the most trying conditions.   We  have  shown\r\n\r\nourselves to be able to withstand such buffets and storms.  This\r\n\r\ncould be attributed to our sound economic and social structures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every election, our Government has been able to recruit\r\n\r\nable people to join the Government.  In other countries, leaders\r\n\r\nare created by opportunity.  We have been able to carry out self-renewal  in  leadership.  The current budget shows that  we  pay\r\n\r\ngreat  attention  to  the education of our young.   While  other\r\n\r\ncountries  have  cut  down  expenditure  on  education  we  have\r\n\r\nincreased it.  When we talk about education we do not  mean  the\r\n\r\nacquisition of knowledge only.  We mean the nurturing of an all-rounded citizen.  In the last two days we have been debating the\r\n\r\nissue of bond breakers under the EDB scholarship scheme.  If  we\r\n\r\nhad  strengthened  our moral education such incidents  need  not\r\n\r\nhave happened.  I hope that the Minister for Education would use\r\n\r\nthis  precious  expenditure to nurture our next  generation  who\r\n\r\nshould  not only be well versed in knowledge and technology  but\r\n\r\nwho are also imbued with sound moral values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget is a very pragmatic and prudent one. It\r\n\r\nreflects the Government's steadfastness in the midst of changes.\r\n\r\nIf  we are united and work for a common purpose, we will be able\r\n\r\nto  weather such crisis.  The last two days saw many MPs  asking\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister  to  tell us more  about  his  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures to help our business community.  I personally feel that\r\n\r\nthe Minister has already got such plans to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  our  business community.  When the time is right  he  will\r\n\r\nannounce such measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from education, I would like to talk about investing\r\n\r\nin  economic infrastructure.  We should be bolder in making such\r\n\r\ninvestments.   Also the business community should  make  use  of\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity  to better prepare themselves  for  the  years\r\n\r\nahead  when  the  economy turns around.  Another  issue  is  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  our  workers.   I am a  bit  disappointed  by  the\r\n\r\ninsufficient  provision for the training of  our  workers.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has expressed that more funds will be provided  when\r\n\r\nthe  need arises.  Some Government agencies have formulated well\r\n\r\nthought-out  plans  to get workers to go back  to  training.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to speak at greater length on this issue  when  the\r\n\r\nallocations  for the Manpower Ministry come up  for  debate.   I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister would be more generous in allocating funds for\r\n\r\nthis item.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While doing everything we can to promote economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment we must not neglect social development.   We  should\r\n\r\r\nset  up  a good and sound social safety net.  This social safety\r\n\r\nnet  has a wider meaning.  It encompasses several aspects.   The\r\n\r\nfirst safety net refers to full employment for the workers.   As\r\n\r\nlong  as  we  have  sound economic policy and measures  and  our\r\n\r\nworkers  are prepared to upgrade themselves we will be  able  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this  first  safety net.  At present,  this  is  not  a\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect refers to the need for workers to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  make themselves employable.  We are worried  about\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment.  The kind of investments we see in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  require  a  highly  skilled workforce.   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould not neglect this problem.  Therefore, workers should  try\r\n\r\nto  make  themselves  employable as long as  they  are  fit  and\r\n\r\nhealthy  and  their  skills  be  made  relevant  to  the  latest\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect of the safety net is rather passive. The\r\n\r\nfirst  safety net is to ensure full employment for  our  people.\r\n\r\nThe second aspect refers to the need for workers to continue  to\r\n\r\nupgrade themselves to be employable throughout life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  third aspect is social protection.  I do not mean  that  we\r\n\r\nshould adopt the western welfare system; we should not fall into\r\n\r\nsuch quagmire.  I am referring to our CPF.  Many people make use\r\n\r\nof  their  CPF balances to invest in this and that.  Apart  from\r\n\r\npurchasing  homes,  we  also use our CPF  balances  to  pay  for\r\n\r\neducation,  medical  expenses and for our  old  age  retirement.\r\n\r\nDuring  an  economic  crisis,  our  CPF  contributions  will  be\r\n\r\nreduced.  What I would like to suggest is that when a worker  is\r\n\r\nretrenched something should be done to assist him.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  propose the setting up of a livelihood protection net.  When\r\n\r\nwe  are  in  an  economic crisis, when we  are  having  negative\r\n\r\ngrowth, we can use this sum of money.  How is this operated?  We\r\n\r\ncan  encourage  employers  and employees  to  co-pay  into  this\r\n\r\nlivelihood insurance (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). They can use their\r\n\r\nCPF  money  to  pay into this fund just like paying  into  their\r\n\r\nMediShield  or  MediShield Plus.  When  they  are  not  able  to\r\n\r\nmaintain their basic living, they can use this money to pay  for\r\n\r\ntheir basic living expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I want to talk about is: how are we going to\r\n\r\nhelp  those elderly workers when they are retrenched?  The  NCMP\r\n\r\nmentioned  about  our Secretary-General's talk on  retrenchment.\r\n\r\nHe  said  other  countries  are doing something  to  help  their\r\n\r\nunemployed  workers.   What about our  Government?   I  want  to\r\n\r\nexplain  to him.  Our stand is that the best guarantee  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers  is  to upgrade their skills and to give them  training.\r\n\r\nWhen  a  company  is faced with retrenchment or downsizing,  the\r\n\r\ncompany   will   retain  only  those  highly  skilled   workers.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have  to  continue to urge  our  workers  to  be\r\n\r\nupgraded, trained and retrained.  If our local workers' skill is\r\n\r\nas good as that of the foreign workers, we will retain our local\r\n\r\nworkers  unless the foreign workers are better skilled than  our\r\n\r\nlocal  workers.   For  those who are  in  the  unions,  we  have\r\n\r\napproached  the  employers  to  devise  other  ways,  eg,   wage\r\n\r\nreduction, reducing the number of working days to cope with  the\r\n\r\ndownturn  in  the  economy.   Should  they  be  retrenched,  our\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Unit also helps them to find new jobs.   We\r\n\r\nalso help them to go for retraining.  We will pay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  their training expenses.  So I would ask the NCMP  to  read\r\n\r\nmore of our union's magazines to have a better understanding  of\r\n\r\nwhat we are doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we adjust our budget, we should not neglect the\r\n\r\nimportance of workers' training.  It is important that while  we\r\n\r\nshould do everything we can to strengthen our infrastructure  we\r\n\r\nshould  not neglect the importance of spiritual development.   I\r\n\r\nam  talking about the safety net provided by the family.  In the\r\n\r\npast  we  used to receive support from the family, but  nowadays\r\n\r\nthe  small  nuclear families account for 80%  of  our  household\r\n\r\nnumber.   The close family ties have been eroded.  I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to provide more funding to MCD to strengthen family\r\n\r\nbonding.   Therefore,  the  Budget should  provide  support  for\r\n\r\ntechnical  education  as  well as  social  education  and  moral\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With better political leaders, better economic policies, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  Singapore  will  convert  this  economic  crisis   into\r\n\r\nopportunities  so  that  the people and the  Government  can  be\r\n\r\nunited  to upgrade themselves to move into the 21st century  and\r\n\r\nwe will emerge stronger than ever.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I would, first, like to compliment the Minister for coming\r\n\r\nup with a good Budget during such a difficult time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would personally describe the Budget that was unveiled as\r\n\r\nfocused and strategic, one that has laid the foundation for long-term  recovery, productivity and competitiveness.  However,  for\r\n\r\nthe  short  term,  the Budget has failed to meet  the  immediate\r\n\r\nconcerns   of   the  general  public  and  business   community,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  small and medium enterprises who  hold  a  more\r\n\r\npessimistic  view  of the economy.  Quite naturally,  Sir,  they\r\n\r\ncannot appreciate the long-term benefits if they are worried and\r\n\r\ndo not have confidence in the short term.  Instilling confidence\r\n\r\nis  crucial  to  business.   You cannot  do  business  by  being\r\n\r\npessimistic.  We need to give businesses enough assistance  that\r\n\r\nwhile they prepare for the worse, they can have enough hope  for\r\n\r\nthe best.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  fails  to provide the badly needed  stimulus.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  diagnosed a mild prescription for an economy many  see\r\n\r\nin  dire  need  for stronger dose of economic  stimulant.   Off-Budget  measures are indeed necessary and reassuring.   However,\r\n\r\nthe fear, as has been expressed earlier, is that it could be too\r\n\r\nlittle,  too  late,  to  help  cushion  the  impact  of  further\r\n\r\ndeterioration in the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to touch on three main areas of emphasis\r\n\r\nin  this Budget, as they really reflect our long-term priorities\r\n\r\nand strategies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, education. Investment in education is crucial in\r\n\r\ngood and bad times.  The emphasis is, therefore, appropriate  at\r\n\r\nleast in keeping with tremendous momentum to prepare and develop\r\n\r\nSingapore into a knowledge-based economy.  $1.3 billion has been\r\n\r\nset  aside  for  development expenditure to pay for  new  school\r\n\r\nbuilding programmes, media resource library, IT Master Plan, and\r\n\r\na  new polytechnic.  Appropriately, there has also been a strong\r\n\r\nrecognition  that  education is a continuing process  throughout\r\n\r\nlife,  from  pre-school to adult worker training and retraining.\r\n\r\nBut  I would like to highlight the need for more to be done  for\r\n\r\nteachers  by  providing more resources in terms of training  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Most of the training is now provided  through  the\r\n\r\ntraining and development budget.  For in-service training,  this\r\n\r\ncan be increased and its availability be made more flexible,  so\r\n\r\nthat  teachers  can  benefit from more resources  and  expertise\r\n\r\noutside the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest greater emphasis be given for\r\n\r\nparents  to  be more involved in their children's  education  by\r\n\r\nhaving  them  involved  in new structured school  programmes  to\r\n\r\nemphasise the participatory approach, and that education of  our\r\n\r\nyoung is a joint responsibility for all of us to shoulder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, defence. While it is tempting we should not be\r\n\r\nlulled into thinking that defence priorities can be scaled down,\r\n\r\nwhen pressing economic challenges make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresource  allocation  and  competition  with  other  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic  priorities  more problematic, it is  precisely  during\r\n\r\nthese  times that the lack of emphasis on defence can send wrong\r\n\r\nand unnecessary signals about the seriousness with regard to the\r\n\r\ndefence of our nation.  It is during these times that it is more\r\n\r\nurgent  for  Singaporeans to remain vigilant and  aware  of  the\r\n\r\nvulnerabilities of our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more practical note, Sir, I would like to ask for more\r\n\r\nresources,  under  public  relations  budget,  to  ensure   that\r\n\r\noperationally  ready  units  take  on  a  more  active  role  in\r\n\r\ncommunicating  with NSmen, their families and  their  employers,\r\n\r\ninstead of living it entirely to otherwise unknown officials  or\r\n\r\nbureaucrats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, socio-economic. I would like to touch on a few of\r\n\r\nthe  specific incentives introduced and highlight  some  of  the\r\n\r\nwish  lists  I have here.  Firstly, while the freeze in  rentals\r\n\r\nfor   HDB  and  JTC  premises  is  a  welcome  move,  there  are\r\n\r\nindications  that it may still be higher than  some  in  private\r\n\r\nsector  rentals  which are more responsive  to  changes  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   Therefore,  the Government  should  not  hesitate  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  rental reductions, if this is necessary.   Government\r\n\r\noperating  in the open market should be equally responsive  when\r\n\r\nthis is needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the tax concession for the transport and\r\n\r\nlogistics industry is timely in view of the efforts to reinforce\r\n\r\nSingapore's  position  as a global city of international  trade.\r\n\r\nHowever,  a foreign industry whose future survival is  dependent\r\n\r\non  its  ability to globalise its operation, incentives to  help\r\n\r\nand  encourage  local  companies to globalise  through  mergers,\r\n\r\nacquisition  and  establish  global  linkages  would   be   more\r\n\r\nsignificant.  Such incentives are absent from this Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, adjustment to land sales would help to ease the\r\n\r\nalready excessive supply of private residential properties.  One\r\n\r\nestimate  puts it that it would take about three years to  clear\r\n\r\nthe  existing supply of properties.  Perhaps, the Government may\r\n\r\nwant  to review the whole issue of Executive Condominiums.   The\r\n\r\ninherent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrestriction  on  foreign property ownership and  limitations  on\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar borrowing by foreigners for property  purchase\r\n\r\ncould  perhaps be reviewed in the light of the current  property\r\n\r\ncrisis.   The review is also timely in view of moves to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  to  settle  in Singapore.   I  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to now consider allowing CPF monies to be used to pay\r\n\r\nfor the initial 20% downpayment for property purchase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the increase in development expenditure. As it\r\n\r\nis   a  prudent  move  and  would  maintain  stability  in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry, it is also more cost-effective  to  carry\r\n\r\nout  major  infrastructure and land reclamation works  during  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  economic slowdown.  I support earlier  proposals  to\r\n\r\nreduce  corporate  taxes  and  freeze  public  sector  fees  and\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we do not forget those who face problems\r\n\r\nduring  these  difficult times.  Charitable  organisations  will\r\n\r\nfind fewer generous and willing corporate sponsors to fund their\r\n\r\nvarious  social and community programmes.  Children and students\r\n\r\nwhose families may have lost their jobs, though temporarily,  we\r\n\r\nhave  the responsibility to ensure that they continue to  go  to\r\n\r\nschools   and  higher  tertiary  education  through   bursaries,\r\n\r\nscholarships,  loans  and grants.  More  funds  should  be  made\r\n\r\navailable,   for  example,  through  the  Community  Development\r\n\r\nCouncils to fund these programmes as CDCs too will find it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  raise funds through voluntary contributions  from\r\n\r\nthe public.  Employers will face retrenchments, not just skilled\r\n\r\nor   unskilled   workers  facing  structural  unemployment   and\r\n\r\ntherefore requiring retraining, but also white collar staff  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals  who need to acquire new skills and  knowledge  as\r\n\r\ntheir   specialist  knowledge  and  expertise  now  find   fewer\r\n\r\nalternatives and opportunities.  I am sure we have the necessary\r\n\r\nresources to help these people should and when the need arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most important of all, Sir, is the need to galvanise\r\n\r\nour  people  during  such  times, for example,  to  help  social\r\n\r\ncommunity organisations.  It must be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade a parcel of every Singaporean life to contribute to society\r\n\r\nin  whatever form.  There is enough goodwill in our people  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  win  their  hearts and minds to help make  Singapore  a\r\n\r\nbetter  place  to  live by helping our friends,  neighbours  and\r\n\r\ncommunities.  Therefore, social community programmes  should  be\r\n\r\nenhanced and not reduced.  We should not let the economic crisis\r\n\r\nmake  us  more  selfish, insular and damage the social  progress\r\n\r\nthat  we have made so far.  We must come out of this crisis  not\r\n\r\nonly  to  be  economically stronger but  also  to  be  socially,\r\n\r\nculturally and racially more cohesive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.05 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank  you very much for allowing me this opportunity to add  my\r\n\r\nsupport  to  the Budget Statement.  37 hon. Members have  spoken\r\n\r\nbefore  me.  There have been a lot of specific suggestions  made\r\n\r\nto  Minister Dr Richard Hu.  Let me now confine myself  to  some\r\n\r\ngeneral comments on the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world and the market see our Government as rational and\r\n\r\ntake the decisions it makes and what it says seriously.  This is\r\n\r\nour strength and a national asset.  We have worked very hard  to\r\n\r\nachieve this image and confidence.  The Budget encapsulates  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  view of the economy of Singapore  for  this  year.\r\n\r\nThe  firmness  and  prudence of the  Budget  reflect  the  quiet\r\n\r\nconfidence  of the Government.  The market has read  the  signal\r\n\r\nand  shares this sentiment.  Hence, the Singapore dollar and the\r\n\r\nStock Exchange of Singapore have remained relatively calm.  I am\r\n\r\nalso  happy  that  the Government has kept open  the  option  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  off-Budget measures later should the regional  crisis\r\n\r\nworsen and our businesses and industries need help.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nmuch  welcomed  assurance which further enhances  confidence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two sides to a crisis. Because of the pain\r\n\r\nand suffering that accompany it, we tend to see the gloomy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nside.   But there are silver linings to it, especially  for  the\r\n\r\nstrong  and the prepared.  As a nation and a people,  there  are\r\n\r\nuseful  lessons to be learned from the crisis.  These are life's\r\n\r\nlessons of hard knocks.  If we imbibe these lessons, it would be\r\n\r\nlike  a  body  developing antibodies after a bout  of  sickness.\r\n\r\nWith  the  antibodies,  the  body  is  strengthened  and  better\r\n\r\nprepared should the disease strike again\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to share with the House my experiences of\r\n\r\nmany  discussions  on  the  regional economic  crisis   with  my\r\n\r\nresidents   and  grassroots  activists.   They  understand   the\r\n\r\nregional  crisis  and appreciate its effects.  It  has  affected\r\n\r\nthem,  their relatives and their friends.  But there  is  little\r\n\r\ndiscontent or moaning.  They have taken it stoically.  They have\r\n\r\nhunkered  down.  They have not blamed the Government.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey  praise the Government for its foresight.  Many  said  that\r\n\r\nthey now appreciate the correctness of Government policies,  the\r\n\r\nimportance of good, competent, frugal and honest governance with\r\n\r\na long-term view and a sound financial and banking system to the\r\n\r\ncountry.   They understand that this is what has saved  us  from\r\n\r\nthe  worst  of the crisis.  They also realise the importance  of\r\n\r\nindividual  responsibility, prudence and thrift.  We  must  take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to drive home these lessons, the importance  of\r\n\r\ngood  governance  and  individual responsibility,  prudence  and\r\n\r\nthrift, clear to our people, especially our young.  This is also\r\n\r\na  time  to unite our people.  Once we have experienced  such  a\r\n\r\ncrisis  and understood the causes and the defence, these lessons\r\n\r\nbecome part and parcel of our psyche as a people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis is a costly lesson for the region and for us.\r\n\r\nWe  must  learn and benefit from it.  We must not let slip  this\r\n\r\noppportunity.   An economic system goes through cycles.   It  is\r\n\r\nthe  law of nature.  Good times follow bad times and vice versa.\r\n\r\nWe  should  not  be surprised by it.  What we should  do  is  to\r\n\r\nprepare  for  the bad times and for the opportunities  to  surge\r\n\r\nforward  to  greater height on the rebound.  During good  times,\r\n\r\neven the weak do well because there is plenty to go\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nround.  However, economic inefficiencies set in as resources are\r\n\r\nnot efficiently allocated.  This will go on until the system can\r\n\r\nno  longer  sustain  the  growing inefficiencies.   An  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn  occurs.  When this happens, the weak are  weeded  out,\r\n\r\nclearing the way for the survivors to push the system forward to\r\n\r\na yet higher level of performance on the upturn.  The cycle will\r\n\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the market must be allowed to do its work. The system\r\n\r\nmust  be allowed to rejuvenate itself for the next cycle.   This\r\n\r\nis  not the first crisis that Singapore has faced nor will it be\r\n\r\nthe last.  In the same vein, the good time enjoyed by the region\r\n\r\nand  Singapore is not at an end.  We will rebound and  the  next\r\n\r\nstage of our prosperity will be even higher if we can seize  the\r\n\r\nopportunities.   To do this, we must keep our  head  during  the\r\n\r\nmadness  of  the crisis.  We must plan and prepare to  ride  the\r\n\r\nnext  crest  of  the wave.  In this light, I am assured  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   allocation  of  more  resources  for   education,\r\n\r\nsecurity and economic infrastructure development.  This will put\r\n\r\nus  in  a  stronger  position to tap the future  growth  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   This  is  a  rational and correct decision.   However,\r\n\r\nthese  are expenditures that many countries in similar situation\r\n\r\nhave  chosen to cut down as they appear less urgent.  This would\r\n\r\nbe a mistake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not be complacent that we have weathered the crisis\r\n\r\nbetter  than  others and allow hubris to blind us.   Comparative\r\n\r\nadvantage  is  relative.   We  have benefited  from  the  weaker\r\n\r\nsystems  of our neighbours.  Their deeper problems in comparison\r\n\r\nadd  to our competitive advantage.  But this is temporary.  When\r\n\r\nthey recover, their systems will be stronger.  In the long term,\r\n\r\nthis  will  reduce our advantage and our efforts to  keep  ahead\r\n\r\nwill  become more difficult.  We must take this opportunity  now\r\n\r\nto  move  faster ahead.  We must review our systems, assumptions\r\n\r\nand  fundamental  beliefs and make changes  to  strengthen  them\r\n\r\nfurther to make them more robust.  In any case, we need to carry\r\n\r\nout  this  exercise regularly, especially now that the world  is\r\n\r\ngetting   smaller  and  changing  faster  all  the  time.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  doing  this.  An example is the announced changes  to  our\r\n\r\nfinancial  system.  The Minister is right to provide  incentives\r\n\r\nto develop the financial sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another is the announcement of the modification of the\r\n\r\nentry  requirements  of the universities,  something  which  was\r\n\r\nviewed almost sacrosanct.  This will give added credence to  our\r\n\r\nprofession  of  creativity and innovation.  Yet another  is  the\r\n\r\nrecent  announcement changes to our road tax  structure.   These\r\n\r\nare  but three examples.  These are glaring testimonies  to  the\r\n\r\nability and the willingness of this Government to meet difficult\r\n\r\nbut  necessary changes for the future.  We may need to do  more,\r\n\r\nmuch more in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I reflect the impact of the regional crisis on our\r\n\r\npeople,  I  am  reminded  of  the  fable  of  the  ant  and  the\r\n\r\ngrasshopper.  During the warm summer, while the ants steadfastly\r\n\r\nprepared  for  the cold winter, the grasshopper went  about  his\r\n\r\ncarefree  ways.   The pains and the joys change position  during\r\n\r\nwinter.   The  colony  of ants knows this and  has  imbibed  the\r\n\r\nlesson.    They  will  survive.   I  would  like   our   people,\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  businesses and industries to be  like  the  ants.\r\n\r\nDuring  the good times, we should work hard and prudently  build\r\n\r\nup  our  reserves in anticipation of the bad times.  If the  bad\r\n\r\ntimes do not come, we will have extra reserves and resources and\r\n\r\nwe  would  have  lost nothing.  But when winter  comes,  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared  for  it and we will survive in relative comfort  until\r\n\r\nspring comes around again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nallow me to add my support to the motion standing in the name of\r\n\r\nthe Minister.  At this time of economic contraction and regional\r\n\r\npolitical  uncertainties, I believe it is wise for the  Minister\r\n\r\nto be prudent and conservative.  While no recession is in sight,\r\n\r\nthe   situation  could  be  changed  unexpectedly  if   economic\r\n\r\nupheavals rock those Asian countries hitherto unaffected by  the\r\n\r\nAsian  flu.   There are lingering uncertainties  as  to  whether\r\n\r\nChina  could  avoid devaluing its currency in  order  to  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive.   The  IMF has withheld the release  of  additional\r\n\r\nfunds for Indonesia as the conditions for market discipline  are\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  met.   As we read from the papers, President Suharto  has\r\n\r\ndeclared  that  the  mandated  IMF  measures  are  against   the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  constitution, perhaps indicating to the market  that\r\n\r\nmore shocks are in store for the regional economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, our treasury therefore must have\r\n\r\nsufficient  surpluses  to  instil confidence  in  our  financial\r\n\r\nsystem  and to react to unseen circumstances.  Many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare experiencing pains when the growth slows down in the current\r\n\r\ntime,  and are urging the Government to provide stimulus to  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  In my view, given that Singapore has experienced  more\r\n\r\nthan 10 years of double-digit growth, it is not necessarily  bad\r\n\r\nto  pause  for a breather and to wring out the excesses  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy  that  had  happened in the last two years.   Indeed,  I\r\n\r\napplaud  the  Minister  for  resisting  calls  for  measures  to\r\n\r\nstimulate  the  economy the very moment we  have  encountered  a\r\n\r\nsmall correction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the findings of\r\n\r\nthe  Feedback  Unit.  Last week, the Feedback Unit  conducted  a\r\n\r\nseries  of  five  sessions with the business community  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral   public.   I  chaired  the  session  for  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity  and would like to take this opportunity to provide  a\r\n\r\nsummary  of  the reactions of the business community.   In  this\r\n\r\nparticular session, representatives were drawn from the  various\r\n\r\nChambers  of Commerce, small and medium enterprises as  well  as\r\n\r\nselected corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general consensus of the budget is that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  has  adopted a reactive rather  than  a  proactive\r\n\r\nposture  in  this uncertain time.  Given this mental  framework,\r\n\r\nthe resultant budget is actually reasonable despite its lack  of\r\n\r\nfinancial   stimuli.   However,  participants  have   questioned\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister  has taken into  consideration  that  the\r\n\r\neconomy  has contracted rapidly in the last two months,  and  is\r\n\r\nindeed  much  worse off than the time the budget  was  prepared,\r\n\r\ngiven that the budget was probably prepared in December and then\r\n\r\nreviewed  in January.   The Singapore International  Chamber  of\r\n\r\nCommerce's  representative highlighted that there are  instances\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindicate  that  MNCs  are  repatriating their  expatriates  from\r\n\r\nSingapore and taken this as an indicator that the trend has been\r\n\r\ngoing downwards rapidly and is still accelerating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, all the participants felt that the budget is\r\n\r\nbiased  towards  helping the financial  sector  and  not  enough\r\n\r\nattention has been paid to the manufacturing sector.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nseveral  participants even mentioned in jest  that  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nfinancial sector has the ears of the Government.  So I think  it\r\n\r\nis important for the Minister to dispel this misperception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of helping small and medium enterprises,\r\n\r\nparticipants felt that increasing the risk sharing of  loans  in\r\n\r\nthe  Local  Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS) by the Government\r\n\r\nis  laudable.  However, the relaxation of this scheme should not\r\n\r\nbe  viewed  as  tantamount to extending greater  help  to  SMEs.\r\n\r\nRelaxation in qualifications for LEFS only increases the  number\r\n\r\nof firms that will qualify for this scheme, in particular, those\r\n\r\nwith higher turnover and those who are probably already stronger\r\n\r\nthan others.  But it did not increase the benefits for those who\r\n\r\nare already qualified but need greater assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most participants have looked forward to the Government\r\n\r\nhelping to reduce the cost of doing business in Singapore.  They\r\n\r\nfelt  that the rental freeze by HDB and JTC and the 15% property\r\n\r\ntax  rebate,  while welcome, do not truly address this  problem.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  being that rentals have been on the downward  trend\r\n\r\nfor more than half a year.  So the rental freeze for another  12\r\n\r\nmonths  is  a  non-event.  For those renting private  commercial\r\n\r\nproperties, they would typically enjoy little or no spin-off  as\r\n\r\na result of the 15% property tax rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of property tax, several participants took the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  point out that the Government's  action  is  an\r\n\r\nirony,  in the sense that IRAS has sent out recent tax  increase\r\n\r\nnotices  for residential properties.  Yes, they understand  that\r\n\r\nsuch notices are sent out after tracking the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket for several months, but the action is still contradictory\r\n\r\nto  current trends and also adds to the financial burden of  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has encouraged companies to deal with\r\n\r\nexcessive labour cost by trimming the variable component of  the\r\n\r\nflexi-wage system.  Several SME representatives pointed out that\r\n\r\nin  the boom years, small companies have been forced to pay high\r\n\r\nwages  to keep their workers, and they did not develop a  flexi-wage system, as the Government encouraged them to do and as  the\r\n\r\nlarger  companies  have already implemented.  They  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  it is not accurate to assume that all companies can adjust\r\n\r\ntheir wage cost by adjusting the variable component of the flexi-wage  system.  Perhaps these companies have themselves to  blame\r\n\r\nfor getting into this current state of affairs.  But that is the\r\n\r\nreality  of  the  labour market and they continue  to  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to look into the reduction of the employer's  portion\r\n\r\nof  the  CPF  contribution as an option to help them  to  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the challenge of workers' training and\r\n\r\nretraining,  most participants, including those from  the  SMEs,\r\n\r\nbelieved that the current lull period is the best opportunity to\r\n\r\ntrain  our workers in preparation for the upturn in the business\r\n\r\ncycle   which  will  inevitably  return.   With  lower  business\r\n\r\nactivities, employers could release workers for training without\r\n\r\nmissing   their   deliverables.   And  workers'  loyalty   could\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  enhanced  and cemented.  Participants  urged  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to support the call by the unions to fund additional\r\n\r\nworkers'  training and retraining.  They also urged the relevant\r\n\r\nfund  administrators to speed up the reimbursement  of  training\r\n\r\ngrants  so  that their cash flow problems could be  reduced,  as\r\n\r\ninterest  cost  has become quite volatile and has  increased  in\r\n\r\nrecent months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is obvious that the retail\r\n\r\nsector  will  be  facing  another year  of  worsening  business.\r\n\r\nParticipants expressed surprise that the Government would reduce\r\n\r\nconsumers' disposable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome at this juncture, when in fact the reverse should be  the\r\n\r\ncase  to help the retail sector.  Their rationale is as follows:\r\n\r\nfor several years now, the Minister has granted one-off personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax  rebate of 10%.  It has almost become  part  of  the\r\n\r\nincome  tax structure.  Therefore, this year's one-off 5% rebate\r\n\r\nis equivalent to an increase of personal income tax and the $130\r\n\r\nmillion  of  disposable  income  has  been  withdrawn  from  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   If  the  Minister has retained  the  traditional  10%\r\n\r\nrebate,  it  would  only reduce the $2.7 billion  surplus  by  a\r\n\r\nminuscule  5%.  This percentage is not very significant  to  the\r\n\r\nsurplus but very important to the domestic retail sector at this\r\n\r\nvery difficult time.  Hence, most of the participants could  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  what moved the Minister to take this  step  at  this\r\n\r\npoint in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feedback session, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  Industry  reiterated its request  for  a  central\r\n\r\ncommittee  to  coordinate all Government fee increases  so  that\r\n\r\ntheir impact could be moderated over time.  In this respect, the\r\n\r\nSingapore Power's recent rate increase of 5% is being held up as\r\n\r\nan  example, and most people felt that the increase is untimely.\r\n\r\nElectricity  being essential and unavoidable to all  businesses,\r\n\r\nthe  electricity rate increase adds to the burden of enterprises\r\n\r\nand  manufacturing  precisely at a time when cost  reduction  is\r\n\r\nwhat  all of us should be concerned with.  Many wondered whether\r\n\r\nthe  corporatisation  of  Singapore  Power  with  its  goal   of\r\n\r\nincreasing its return of assets is the real reason for the  rate\r\n\r\nincrease,  rather  than  the higher fuel  cost.   The  Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber  of Commerce and Industry also  reiterated  its\r\n\r\ncall for the Minister to make use of some of the $2.7 billion to\r\n\r\nassist businessmen at this time.  And my colleague, Mr Tay  Beng\r\n\r\nChuan, has gone into it in detail, and I would not do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regional economic crisis also brought difficulties\r\n\r\nfor  small  traders whose businesses have always  been  done  on\r\n\r\ncredit.   Their  businesses have been squeezed by  the  regional\r\n\r\neconomic crisis.  And with the collapse of the Indonesian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrupiah,  the  credits extended to their Indonesian clients  have\r\n\r\nturned  into  bad debts.  This problem has already dragged  down\r\n\r\nthe  profits  of  the  big four banks.  The  small  traders  are\r\n\r\nsuffering in silence.  They are hoping that the credit guarantee\r\n\r\nscheme  proposed  by the Prime Minister could be  put  in  place\r\n\r\nquickly to enable them to continue their business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies have ventured overseas in response to the\r\n\r\ncall  by  the Government to sprout a second wing, and many  have\r\n\r\nsuffered   losses   in   their   overseas   subsidiaries.    The\r\n\r\nparticipants would like to appeal to the Minister to allow these\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  make use of such losses in their subsidiaries  to\r\n\r\noffset taxable profit in the Singapore parent company.  They are\r\n\r\naware  that the Minister has not been sympathetic to this appeal\r\n\r\nin  the  past.  But they would like the Minister to  review  the\r\n\r\nsituation,  as  much of the losses recently is not  due  to  bad\r\n\r\nbusiness judgment but circumstances beyond anyone's anticipation\r\n\r\nand control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that summarizes the feedback of the business community\r\n\r\nin   the  Feedback  Unit's  discussion.   I  believe  the  views\r\n\r\nexpressed are fairly representative.  Everyone present was  very\r\n\r\ngrateful  for the undertaking given by the Minister to make  use\r\n\r\nof  off-Budget measures to assist the businesses if the  economy\r\n\r\ntakes an unexpected turn for the worse, although they would like\r\n\r\nto  know  what  those  measures  are  likely  to  be.   What  is\r\n\r\ninteresting to me is that everyone has an unshakable  confidence\r\n\r\nin the Government's ability to turn the tide if the need arises.\r\n\r\nMaybe that is a compliment to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an additional comment on the timing of the feedback, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  International Chamber of Commerce and Industry  feels\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  be more meaningful to have a session  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  before,  rather than after the Budget  sessions.   The\r\n\r\npractice by the Hong Kong and Malaysian authorities was cited as\r\n\r\nexamples of other governments' practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a disservice to the participants if they came\r\n\r\nacross as being too parochial in their views.  Therefore, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould also like to reflect their attitude when other aspects  of\r\n\r\nthe  budget  are being touched on.  When it was pointed  out  to\r\n\r\nthem  that  the  Government  indeed  increased  allocation   for\r\n\r\ninfrastructure expenditures such as Jurong Island,  Changi  East\r\n\r\nas  well  as  provision  in the Ministry of  Education  for  new\r\n\r\nschools,  they agreed that these are important stimulus measures\r\n\r\nalbeit  confined to the construction sector of the economy.   It\r\n\r\nis  also useful to note that they have no issue with the defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure, despite its substantial increase from 4.4% to  4.6%\r\n\r\nof  GDP.   Indeed,  they were very supportive  of  the  need  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  defence  capability,  especially  at  this   time   of\r\n\r\nuncertainty.  They generally feel that their concerns would pale\r\n\r\nagainst  the  consequences  of  potential  social  upheavals  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  if  riots  over  cost  of  basic  necessities  become\r\n\r\nwidespread  and  uncontrollable.   Put  in  this  context,   all\r\n\r\nparticipants agreed that the Minister for Finance has achieved a\r\n\r\njudicious  balance between being conservative and  proactive  in\r\n\r\nmanaging our nation's finances at this juncture when the  future\r\n\r\nis so uncertain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to compliment the\r\n\r\nMinister  for an excellent budget, giving something for everyone\r\n\r\nalthough  the  amount given out is a little bit less  than  last\r\n\r\nyear.  At a time when other Finance Ministers in the region have\r\n\r\nto scramble to keep their nation's finances afloat, our Minister\r\n\r\ncan  still  boast  a budget surplus.  He must  be  the  envy  of\r\n\r\nFinance Ministers everywhere else.  If any Singaporean still has\r\n\r\ndoubts  of  the  effectiveness and  the  farsightedness  of  our\r\n\r\npolitical  leadership and of the PAP Government, I believe  that\r\n\r\nthis budget should dispel all such doubts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, this year's budget can be said to be a  sure  and\r\n\r\nsteady budget.  It is like a description in the Chinese kung  fu\r\n\r\nstory: \"when a blow is delivered, only 50% of the power is  used\r\n\r\nwith  some power kept in reserve.  Contain motion with  quietude\r\n\r\nand  counter changes with no change.\"  I support this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkind  of  budget.  When we make the offensive,  we  must  always\r\n\r\nreserve some strength for the defensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the positive side, this budget seeks to strengthen the\r\n\r\nfinancial  services sector which is the first to bear the  brunt\r\n\r\nof the regional financial crisis.  The financial services sector\r\n\r\nis a high-value added industry.  It provides the impetus for the\r\n\r\nother trades and industries to progress and to ensure their long-term steady growth.  It has the greatest effect in promoting the\r\n\r\noverall  economic  development and to provide job  security  and\r\n\r\ngood remuneration for the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's budget, emphasis is given to the areas of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  construction, education  and  defence.   At  the\r\n\r\npresent stage, these are the areas which need to be strengthened\r\n\r\nto enhance our competitiveness.  It is a wise move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, enhancing the skills of our limited human\r\n\r\nresources and their employability is also a task which brooks no\r\n\r\ndelay.  Can the Government consider increasing the allocation of\r\n\r\nfunds  to support those who are willing and prepared to  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir skills, so that they can  go for training to enhance their\r\n\r\nemployability?  Just as my colleague, Mr Lim Swee Say, has  said\r\n\r\njust  now,  this is in line with the long term interest  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the recession in the 80s, we came to know of an\r\n\r\neffective  and  not too painful way to help the nation  and  the\r\n\r\npeople to tide over the crisis, ie, the flexi-wage system. Where\r\n\r\nnecessary, the flexi-wage system can help lighten the burden  of\r\n\r\nlabour  cost of the investors without affecting the basic  wages\r\n\r\nand   income  of  our  workers.   Can  the  Government  consider\r\n\r\nintroducing  some  measures to encourage the private  sector  to\r\n\r\nfully adopt the flexi-wage system?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, Singapore's economy has not gone into\r\n\r\na  recession  as  in  the  80s.  I urge the  Government  not  to\r\n\r\nconsider  reducing  the CPF contribution  rates  on  either  the\r\n\r\nemployers' or employees' sides.  I hope the Minister  will  give\r\n\r\nour workers an assurance that until and unless all other options\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexhausted,  the Government will not reduce the CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrates for the employers and employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the effect of the financial and currency crisis, and\r\n\r\nthe   uncertain   market   situation,  the   voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  (VWOs) are heading for a  hard  time.   They  are\r\n\r\nfacing  tremendous  pressure in trying to meet  the  target  for\r\n\r\ntheir  fund-raising efforts.  The Chinese characters for raising\r\n\r\nfund  are chou kuan [               ]. The first character  chou\r\n\r\nsounds  exactly the same as the Chinese word [            ]  for\r\n\r\nworry  or  anxiety.  To these VWOs, to raise fund is  to  \"worry\r\n\r\nabout  the  fund\".  It is like the Chinese saying: \"the  worries\r\n\r\nreflected  on  the frowning brows strike deep into  the  heart\".\r\n\r\nThe   famous female poet Li Qing Zao from the Song Dynasty  once\r\n\r\nwrote  a  well-known line: \"All the boats on the two rivers  are\r\n\r\nnot  enough  to ferry all my worries.\"  Many of these  voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations may be paralyzed because they are  unable\r\n\r\nto raise enough funds to attain their target.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, organisations which provide convalescence\r\n\r\nservice,  recuperative service for the chronic sick or day  care\r\n\r\nservice  for  the  aged, enjoy a uniform 50%  subsidy  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Can  the  Government consider  granting  a  higher\r\n\r\nsubsidy to the financially troubled organisations such as  those\r\n\r\nproviding these convalescence or recuperative services?  Can the\r\n\r\nGovernment  increase the subsidy from 50% to, say, 65%?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese idiom kai yuan jie liu [\r\n\r\n],  meaning, increase income and decrease expenditure.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is unable to provide more subsidy, ie,  to  increase\r\n\r\ntheir  income,  then  perhaps  it may  consider  setting   up  a\r\n\r\nspecial task force to help these voluntary welfare organisations\r\n\r\nimprove    their  efficiency  so  as  to  reduce  the  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Can  they be given higher rebates on the road  tax\r\n\r\nof their vehicles?  This will help to lighten their burden.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  may  also consider providing some  professional  and\r\n\r\nless  expensive  medical  supplies to reduce  their  operational\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nFinally, I hope that despite the shadow of this economic crisis,\r\n\r\nthe Government may seriously consider introducing some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  allow  the  cultural organisations  to  have  some\r\n\r\ndiscounts  when they rent the venues for  performances  to  send\r\n\r\nthe signal  that the Government's effort to promote the arts  to\r\n\r\ndevelop Singapore into a gracious society will not be slackened.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin support of the motion proposed by the Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's budget is indeed a prudent and focused budget.\r\n\r\nThe  budget signals to all Singaporeans to be prudent  in  their\r\n\r\nspending in view of the current regional financial turmoil.   As\r\n\r\nhighlighted by the Finance Minister, and I quote, \"The  regional\r\n\r\ncrisis is far from over.\"  Singapore  must be both mentally  and\r\n\r\nfinancially prepared to overcome this crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget has also taken the opportunity to further\r\n\r\nincrease  the economic competitiveness and capabilities  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  The 24.9% increase in development expenditure  clearly\r\n\r\nshows  the  Government's commitment and long term strategies  to\r\n\r\nposition Singapore as a global player in the next millennium.  I\r\n\r\nfully  support the increase in capital expenditure on education,\r\n\r\ndefence and economic infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now discuss the details of the budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rebates for individuals</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the regional crisis, Singaporeans, especially\r\n\r\nthe low income earners, will face tougher times ahead.  Some may\r\n\r\neven  face  unemployment or disruption in their monthly  income.\r\n\r\nDuring  such  times, they would need every assistance  rendered.\r\n\r\nBeing  a  people's Government, this Government must  offer  more\r\n\r\nfinancial  assistance in whatever forms to help Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\ntide over the crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 3,000 families living in 1-, 2- and 3-room\r\n\r\nHDB  flats which will be affected by the rental and S&C rebates.\r\n\r\nThe S&C rebate ranges from 0.5 months to 2 months.  In many town\r\n\r\ncouncils,  arrears for S&C charges range between  10%  and  15%.\r\n\r\nThe  majority  in arrears owe one, two or three  months.   Thus,\r\n\r\nrebates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  S&C  as  provided by the budget will not  have  any  direct\r\n\r\nbenefit  to  these families except helping the town councils  to\r\n\r\nimprove their financial position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government gave $36 million in rental and\r\n\r\nS&C  rebates, which have benefited many Singaporeans.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  urge  the Finance Minister to consider increasing  the\r\n\r\nrental and S&C rebates for 1-, 2-  and 3-room HDB residents.  We\r\n\r\nshould provide at least three months' rental and S&C rebates  to\r\n\r\n1-, 2- and 3-room flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a more direct way of providing assistance to\r\n\r\nthe  low-income earners is to increase the utilities rebate  for\r\n\r\nthese families.  Low income families, in particular  those  with\r\n\r\nlarge families, will encounter much difficulty to cope with  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  utility rates.  I do not think  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nutility  rebates  will  hamper  efforts  by  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nencourage Singaporeans to save water and energy.  In fact,  many\r\n\r\nof  these families are very careful in the utilisation of  water\r\n\r\nand  energy, as many could not afford to pay high utility bills.\r\n\r\nThus, I would urge the Finance Minister to at least provide $300\r\n\r\nfor utilities rebates during this difficult period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Property tax for residential properties</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the budget provides a 15% property tax rebate for\r\n\r\ncommercial and industrial properties, no relief was provided for\r\n\r\nhome-owners.  Many home-owners, especially those in the  private\r\n\r\nresidential,  are facing high costs of servicing their  property\r\n\r\nloans due to rising interest rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the Government introduced the GST to widen our tax\r\n\r\nbase,  and  focused on taxing consumption instead of income  and\r\n\r\ninvestment.   Traditionally,  property  tax  provides  a   major\r\n\r\nrevenue  source to the Government and enables the Government  to\r\n\r\nstimulate  investment and encourage development in the  country.\r\n\r\nWith  the  introduction  of GST and the Government's  thrust  on\r\n\r\nasset enhancement, the role of property tax must be reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, over 90% of Singaporeans are homeowners as a result\r\n\r\nof  the efforts of our Government. To levy a 4% property tax  on\r\n\r\nowner-occupied  properties  amounts  to  taxing   90%   of   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   This  works against the GST taxation  philosophy\r\n\r\nand the asset enhancement programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the computation of property tax, which is\r\n\r\nbased  on  annual  value  valuation, has  resulted  in  lots  of\r\n\r\nunproductive  administrative work and unhappy  home-owners.   In\r\n\r\nthe  last recession in 1985, there were 20,285 objections raised\r\n\r\nby homeowners on the annual value valuation of their properties.\r\n\r\nJust  imagine how much time and efforts were spent by the Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue  Authority  of  Singapore  and Singaporeans  to  resolve\r\n\r\nthese objections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to urge the Finance Minister to\r\n\r\ntake  the  drastic  step  to initiate  a  gradual  property  tax\r\n\r\nreduction mechanism which will finally remove property  tax  for\r\n\r\nowner-occupied properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Development expenditure on education</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Finance Minister for allocating a generous\r\n\r\nbudget for the Education Ministry.  I fully agree that we should\r\n\r\ncontinue to invest and upgrade our educational system to produce\r\n\r\na  quality workforce which will spearhead our country's  economy\r\n\r\ninto the international market in the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of $847 million has been allocated for the\r\n\r\nupgrading/rebuilding  and  construction  of  schools   and   the\r\n\r\nprovision of IT resources.  While it is good that we continue to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  our  education  system, we  should  also  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to increase the capabilities of our  own  local  IT\r\n\r\nfirms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special tie-ups with the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme\r\n\r\ncould  be arranged to allow small and medium IT firms to provide\r\n\r\nservices  to  the  Education  Ministry.   These  exposures  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  increase  the innovative, creative  and  competitive\r\n\r\ncapabilities of our IT firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I hope the Finance Minister would further expand the\r\n\r\nLocal Enterprise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancing  Scheme to give priority to local IT firms  which  are\r\n\r\nkeen to serve our Education Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>IT grant for pre-school centres</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop a national attitude of \"Thinking\r\n\r\nSchools,  Learning Nation\", we need to initiate  programmes  for\r\n\r\nour  children  at  a very young age.  IT provides  an  excellent\r\n\r\nmeans  to  arouse  interest in creative  learning  and  develops\r\n\r\nthinking skills for our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to start early, and pre-school education plays an\r\n\r\nimportant  role  in  facilitating the  IT  Master  Plan  of  the\r\n\r\nEducation Ministry.  The PAP Community Foundation, NTUC and some\r\n\r\nprivate   kindergartens  are  providing   excellent   pre-school\r\n\r\neducation services to prepare our children for primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 80,000 students are enrolled in the PAP Community\r\n\r\nFoundation  pre-school centres and kindergartens each  year.   A\r\n\r\nlarge proportion of these students enter the main stream primary\r\n\r\neducation yearly.  However, not all pupils have the privilege to\r\n\r\nlearn  IT skills in these centres.  The PAP Community Foundation\r\n\r\nand  NTUC  are  non-profit making organisations  and  thus  have\r\n\r\nlimited  financial resources.  As a result, they are  unable  to\r\n\r\nprovide   computer-aided  instruction  facilities  to  all   its\r\n\r\neducation centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Education Ministry would like to\r\n\r\nconcentrate on main stream education, and let the private sector\r\n\r\nprovide  pre-school  education  services.   But  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould   provide   support  to  encourage   private   pre-school\r\n\r\ninstitutions to improve their teaching facilities, especially in\r\n\r\nIT-related areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Finance Minister to provide\r\n\r\ncapital  grants  to  approved pre-school  institutions  for  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of IT teaching facilities. To further encourage Total\r\n\r\nEducation of our children, the Government should also set  up  a\r\n\r\nPre-School  Edusave  Fund.  This fund can  provide  subsidy  for\r\n\r\npupils  in pre-school institutions to take up enrichment courses\r\n\r\nsuch as IT, music, thinking skills, and drama to further develop\r\n\r\nthe potentials of our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the Finance Minister will seriously\r\n\r\nconsider  providing more rebates for the 1-, 2- and 3- room  HDB\r\n\r\nflats,  increase the utilities rebates, reduce property tax  and\r\n\r\nprovide  grants  for  pre-school centres  to  improve  their  IT\r\n\r\nfacilities.   If  this cannot be done now, I  hope  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  will  take  off-Budget measures to  provide  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  to low income families when the full impact  of  the\r\n\r\nregional crisis takes place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  the Budget.  First, I would like to extend  my  sincere\r\n\r\nappreciation  to  the  Government and,  in  particular,  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance for the prudent fiscal policy  implemented\r\n\r\nover the years.  This can be seen in the degree to which we have\r\n\r\nbeen  affected by the on-going economic crisis and  how  we  are\r\n\r\nable  to weather the present crisis.  Many Singaporeans in  many\r\n\r\nfeedback  sessions  have stated that they now understand  better\r\n\r\nand, in fact, appreciate the Government's foresight and prudence\r\n\r\nin building up the large reserves over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the current Budget. The Budget\r\n\r\nhas  been  hailed by some as a thinking man's  Budget.   I  wish\r\n\r\ninstead  that it had been everybody's Budget.  While  I  commend\r\n\r\nthe  Government for being prudent, I feel that this  time  round\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  been far too conservative  in  its  fiscal\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regional economic environment has turned for the\r\n\r\nworse.   The  latest delay in the review of the IMF package  for\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  the disbursement of the second tranche  of  loan\r\n\r\nwill mean that the political, economic and social environment in\r\n\r\nthe  region  may get worse.  The latest earnings  warnings  last\r\n\r\nweek  from  big US electronics corporations will mean  that  the\r\n\r\noutlook for the local electronics sector, which makes up half of\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing  industry,  will  not  be  too  bright.   The\r\n\r\nregional  economic  climate,  the  local  retail,  tourism   and\r\n\r\nproperty  slowdown, coupled with the high interest rates,  lower\r\n\r\nincomes,  and  high Government charges, fees and  rentals,  will\r\n\r\nonly add to the economic slowdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some fiscal stimulus was introduced by increasing\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure, I was disappointed by the lack  of  fiscal\r\n\r\nstimulus   in  increasing  personal  consumption.   I  certainly\r\n\r\nexpected  more preventive medicine to prevent the  economy  from\r\n\r\ngetting sick.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I commend the Government on continuing with its long-term objective of developing a good educated workforce, an\r\n\r\nexcellent  economic infrastructure and a strong  defence  force.\r\n\r\nThese  are  basics  which  are vital for  our  survival  and  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining our economic competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to some of the budgetary issues\r\n\r\nthat are of concern to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Income tax rebate for individuals</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue, Sir, is the income tax rebate for\r\n\r\nindividuals.   There was general disappointment in  the  smaller\r\n\r\namount of income tax rebate that was given to individuals.  Many\r\n\r\nhave  expected a 10-15% income tax rebate.  Many feel  that  the\r\n\r\ntax  payable  will  become an increased burden  in  the  present\r\n\r\nenvironment,  as many Singaporeans use their current  income  to\r\n\r\npay last year's income tax.  Many find it hard to understand why\r\n\r\nthe  Government is less generous this year when the  economy  is\r\n\r\nslowing  down  and many are expected to earn less,  or  even  be\r\n\r\njobless.   The Government could have been more generous  as  the\r\n\r\nbudget surplus is usually underestimated in the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Local Enterprise Financing Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the second issue, which is, the Local\r\n\r\nEnterprise  Financing  Scheme.  Our businessmen  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nrecognition  by Government of the difficulty in getting  capital\r\n\r\nand  the  increased  cost of capital to support  their  business\r\n\r\nactivities.  The increase in provision from $760 million to $1.1\r\n\r\nbillion  looks  substantial  on  first  sight.   However,   some\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  have expressed concern that the impact  on  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies would be negligible for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there will be an increase in the number of\r\n\r\ncompanies  which will qualify for these loans as the eligibility\r\n\r\nthreshold has been increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there may be a tendency to devote more of these\r\n\r\nnew loans to the bigger and better capitalised companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, banks have already become very stringent in their\r\n\r\nlending and smaller businesses would find it even more difficult\r\n\r\nto obtain these loans from banks which administer the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister for Finance to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe following requests be looked into:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that small and big companies are equally assisted\r\n\r\nunder  the expanded LEFS scheme to avoid complaints of any  bias\r\n\r\ntowards the bigger companies.  The Minister may perhaps consider\r\n\r\nimposing  a  quota on the total amount that can be disbursed  to\r\n\r\nthe  bigger companies to ensure that smaller companies  are  not\r\n\r\nleft out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that banks are not too conservative in setting\r\n\r\nthe criteria or standard in considering these loan applications,\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the present business conditions.  In view  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment sharing a greater part of the risk in the LEFS scheme\r\n\r\nunder  the Budget, I think the Government should play  a  bigger\r\n\r\nrole  and  have  a  greater  say  in  the  credit  analysis  and\r\n\r\ndisbursement of these loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would request that a Government-nominated\r\n\r\nofficer  sit  in  the credit committee of the banks  considering\r\n\r\nloans  under  the  LEFS  scheme, so that Government  can  gather\r\n\r\nfaster  feedback on the criteria and standards set by the banks.\r\n\r\nThis  would  enable  the Government both  to  monitor  the  loan\r\n\r\ndisbursing  process  and  make  changes  in  the  criteria   and\r\n\r\nstandard, if necessary, to assist local companies.  Such  timely\r\n\r\nfeedback  would be essential as companies' financial  needs  and\r\n\r\nproblems must be attended to promptly before they go under.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to another topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>No increased taxes on alcohol</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has traditionally sent a strong message\r\n\r\nto  discourage  cigarette smoking by increasing  the  duties  on\r\n\r\ncigarettes.   However, I was disappointed  that  the  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not  view the serious consequences of alcohol consumption.\r\n\r\nIt   is   becoming  increasingly  clear  that  more   and   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are consuming alcohol.  Even the young are starting\r\n\r\nto  consume  alcohol at a younger age.  By keeping the  duty  on\r\n\r\nalcohol  at existing rates, the Government is sending the  wrong\r\n\r\nmessage  to the population, particularly to the young.   I  must\r\n\r\nexpress  my  disappointment that the  Government  has  not  made\r\n\r\nalcohol  more expensive and help prevent many Singaporeans  from\r\n\r\ngetting into this habit which is seductive in the short run, but\r\n\r\naddictive  in  the  long run.  Sir, I hope the Government  takes\r\n\r\nfurther measures to highlight the health hazards of alcohol  and\r\n\r\nthe problems of alcoholism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Mortgage interest relief scheme</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the fourth issue, ie, the\r\n\r\nmortgage  interest  relief scheme, which was introduced  in  the\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  budget.   One of the consequences  of  the  property\r\n\r\nbubble  until  May  1996  has  been  the  increased  number   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who have committed to property.  Many middle income\r\n\r\nfamilies, particularly those with fixed income, are affected  by\r\n\r\nthe sudden increase in the mortgage repayment amounts.  Some are\r\n\r\ntiding  over  with savings.  Some have surrendered and  let  the\r\n\r\nbanks  repossess their properties.  With the continuing economic\r\n\r\nuncertainties,  more  may not be in a position  to  repay  their\r\n\r\nproperty loans.  The general feeling among Singaporeans is  that\r\n\r\nlocal  banks are quick to raise interest rates on loans but  are\r\n\r\nvery  slow in reducing them.  It may perhaps be some time before\r\n\r\ninterest rates on property loans come down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would go a long way if some form of mortgage interest\r\n\r\nrelief  scheme could be extended to residential property owners,\r\n\r\nif not as a permanent relief, at least as a temporary relief, on\r\n\r\na year-to-year basis.  Such a scheme could for a start be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextended  to owner-occupied residential property and be  limited\r\n\r\nto  one  property.  I hope the Minister could  consider  such  a\r\n\r\nscheme to help residential property owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Help for manufacturing sector</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, Sir, in respect of help for manufacturing sector,\r\n\r\nmany in the manufacturing sector have criticised the Budget  for\r\n\r\nfocusing  too much on the finance sector.  Their criticisms  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  totally  unjustified.  The Minister  may  perhaps  have\r\n\r\nchosen  to  wait for the report of the Committee on  Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness  before introducing more measures  to  help  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector.   I  would  urge  the  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   hasten   the  Committee's   Report,   as   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing community is becoming more worried each  day  with\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions turning for the worse.  So when the  Report\r\n\r\ndoes  come  out, I hope the Minister will move equally  fast  to\r\n\r\nimplement the recommendations to help the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Freeze on increases in Government fees and charges</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sixth issue is the call for a freeze on increases\r\n\r\nin  Government  fees and charges, which was also highlighted  by\r\n\r\ntwo  other MPs in their earlier speeches.  In the light  of  the\r\n\r\ncontinuing  deterioration of economic conditions,  it  is  quite\r\n\r\nclear that the incomes of Singaporeans would remain unchanged or\r\n\r\neven  drop.  Government leaders have already agreed  to  a  wage\r\n\r\nfreeze.  It is quite clear that the private sector will take the\r\n\r\nsignal  and  follow  suit.   It  is  important  that  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries,  statutory  boards, autonomous  agencies  and  other\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies freeze any increase for the next  12  months\r\n\r\nuntil   the  economic  outlook  changes  for  the  better.    If\r\n\r\nGovernment  and related agencies increase fees and  charges,  it\r\n\r\nwould naturally mean a drop in real income for Singaporeans.  It\r\n\r\nwill also send the wrong signal to the private sector that it is\r\n\r\nokay to increase their rates and charges.  Sir, here, I hope the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can set an example and lead.  On this note,  I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that  the recent increase by Singapore Power in the  tariff\r\n\r\nfor electricity did not go\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown  with  businesses and Singaporeans at large.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister can implement a policy to freeze all increases for  one\r\n\r\nyear and not restrict them to JTC and HDB rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Feedback from business and ordinary Singaporeans</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the seventh issue which has been covered by the Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the Feedback Unit, Dr Wang Kai Yuen, is  basically\r\n\r\nthat feedback from the business and ordinary Singaporeans is not\r\n\r\nobtained  before the Budget is finalised.  Even if the views  of\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and ordinary Singaporeans are not acceded  to,  they\r\n\r\nare  by and large generally happy to at least feel that they had\r\n\r\ntheir  fair  share in giving their opinions and views.   I  must\r\n\r\nagree that timely feedback from the interested quarters may make\r\n\r\na  difference.   For  example, the Minister and  his  officials,\r\n\r\nwhile preparing the Budget some time back, may be of the opinion\r\n\r\nthat  matters have not deteriorated to warrant further  measures\r\n\r\nin  this  Budget.   However,  the business  community  which  is\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  the day-to-day running of business will  tell  you\r\n\r\nthat  matters are deteriorating too fast and that urgent  action\r\n\r\nneeds to be initiated before many go down.  I would like to urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to initiate dialogue and feedback  sessions  with\r\n\r\nvarious  interest  groups  prior to the  preparation  of  future\r\n\r\nBudgets.  This will certainly enable more timely feedback to  be\r\n\r\nobtained  and  enable the Minister to formulate  a  Budget  that\r\n\r\ntakes  into  account all views and opinions.  It will  certainly\r\n\r\ncreate  a  sense of participation by all Singaporeans  in  their\r\n\r\nnational Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me say that this year's Budget will\r\n\r\ncertainly   benefit  our  country  and  enhance  our   long-term\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   I am confident that Singaporeans  will  rally\r\n\r\nbehind  the Government in these uncertain times.  Many  business\r\n\r\nsectors and individuals will be affected by the ongoing regional\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis.   I  urge  the  Minister  to  act  early   and\r\n\r\ngenerously to help the affected groups and individuals  as  part\r\n\r\nof his off-Budget measures before it becomes too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is always difficult to be the last speaker on  such  a\r\n\r\nwell-responded  debate,  with  so  many  eloquent  and   capable\r\n\r\nspeakers  before me.  Every aspect of the Budget is  covered  in\r\n\r\nsuch  great  depth  and detail.  Nevertheless,  being  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, I have to join in with those Members who  appeal\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister for more speedy and positive response  to  the\r\n\r\ncurrent economic turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax incentives given to the financial sector are most\r\n\r\ngenerous  but  will only yield results in the long  term  basis.\r\n\r\nThe business sector needs more immediate stimulation.  There  is\r\n\r\na Chinese saying, \"Yuan shui bu neng jiu jin huo\" [ ] - roughly \r\n\r\ntranslated, \"Distance water\r\n\r\ncannot fight close fire\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am alarmed at how fast and unpredictable events have\r\n\r\ndeteriorated  during the mere one week after  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  Budget.  Conflicts have  surfaced  between  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  government  and the IMF.   The  possibility  of  IMF\r\n\r\nwithdrawing its rescue programme is very real.  The  rupiah  has\r\n\r\nplunged  to  more than 12,000.  The whole region's currency  and\r\n\r\nequity market is going into another tailspin.  In Singapore, our\r\n\r\nbanks'  profits  drop  sharply and the international  investment\r\n\r\nservices  have  lowered the ratings of our top  six  traditional\r\n\r\nsolid   banks,  from  stable  to  negative.   Corporate  results\r\n\r\nreleased are disappointing.  And the likelihood of us going into\r\n\r\na recession in all probability may become a reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the building industry which I have very close contact\r\n\r\nwith,  the  situation  is  far from stable.   Some  construction\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  already in danger of going into liquidation  and\r\n\r\nhave  assigned their existing work for others to carry on.  Most\r\n\r\nof  the consultancy firms in this industry are actually engaging\r\n\r\nin  retrenchment  exercise.  Some have gone  into  restructuring\r\n\r\nwhere they combine retrenchment and overall pay reduction in the\r\n\r\nhope  that  they can preserve as much as possible  the  existing\r\n\r\norganisation  structure.  Although this is a move in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection, how long and to what extent they can last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremain  a very pessimistic question.  Although it should be  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  responsibility to ensure the  success  of  private\r\n\r\nenterprises, in times of very unusual crisis like  this  one  we\r\n\r\nare  confronted  with,  the Government can  be  instrumental  in\r\n\r\nassisting them to survive through this difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question of propping up the interest of a few\r\n\r\nindividuals  but  rather  how to ensure our  long-term  national\r\n\r\ninterest  can  be safeguarded.  For example, if  the  Government\r\n\r\nintroduces measures to stabilise the property market, it  should\r\n\r\nnever  be  seen  as an act of helping a handful  of  developers.\r\n\r\nTheir individual survival is inconsequential, but for the reason\r\n\r\nthat  a  complete collapse in the property market will not  only\r\n\r\naffect  nearly  90%  of our people who are home-owners  and  the\r\n\r\nimplication  of  such  fall-out will also have  a  very  serious\r\n\r\nnegative domino effect on our economy.  One only has to look  at\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening  in  the property market  in  Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nThailand to realise the serious consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always taken comfort in the fact that we have built\r\n\r\na strong foundation in Singapore through having good governance,\r\n\r\ndeveloped a world-class infrastructure and cultivated  a  highly\r\n\r\neducated and skilful workforce.  This is the reason why we  have\r\n\r\nachieved  phenomenal  economic  success  in  the  last   decade.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  of  paramount importance  to  preserve  this\r\n\r\nirreplaceable asset, be it in the private or public sector.   We\r\n\r\nhave to ensure that in coping with the inevitable crisis in  our\r\n\r\neconomy during the next few years, we must do everything we  can\r\n\r\nto  keep the infrastructure in all our businesses, manufacturing\r\n\r\nand professional sectors intact.  It has taken us the last 20 to\r\n\r\n30  years  to  build up this infrastructure and  much  has  been\r\n\r\ninvested in time and money to build up the hardware and software\r\n\r\nas well as to develop to the fullest the human resources.  If we\r\n\r\nallow  it  to  disintegrate, the implication  can  be  extremely\r\n\r\nnegative.  Not only all this talk about the advantages  we  have\r\n\r\nover our neighbours in being able to jump start our economy when\r\n\r\nthe region's economies recover will be neutralised, but our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nachievements in the past three decades may be just mere  history\r\n\r\nand our vision for the future may never be a reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is essential for the Government to act now to\r\n\r\ninduce  greater  confidence into the already depressed  business\r\n\r\nclimate.   Much  more can and should be done  in  terms  of  tax\r\n\r\nreduction,  rebates or any measure to reduce the cost  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness.   We  must  help  to lift the  sentiment  and  restore\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  market.  We must position  ourselves  as  a\r\n\r\nstrong  economic force to ride the wave of recovery.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nwe  will have to join our neighbouring countries to struggle  to\r\n\r\nrebuild our economy long after this crisis is over.  I have full\r\n\r\nconfidence  that, with sound and decisive Government action  and\r\n\r\nour  resilient population, we will be able to ride through  this\r\n\r\nstorm.   All  we need is for the Minister to provide  some  high\r\n\r\noctane fuel to keep our economic engine running.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

As\r\n\r\nusual,  time  will  not allow me to respond to  all  the  issues\r\n\r\nraised.   I  will therefore focus on the main issues  and  leave\r\n\r\nother  matters  of  details  which  are  under  the  purview  of\r\n\r\nindividual Ministries to the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have reflected the sentiments of businesses\r\n\r\nthat  the  economic situation is worse than what the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  thought, and that more should have been done  now  to  help\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  individuals cope with the  difficulties  brought\r\n\r\nabout by the regional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrisis.  There were also comments that the Government should  be\r\n\r\nproactive  rather than wait for the economic climate  to  worsen\r\n\r\nbefore  reacting.   A  number  of Members  have  also  expressed\r\n\r\nconcerns  that  the Budget has not offered enough  help  to  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector and the small and medium enterprises,  and\r\n\r\nthat  there were not enough new initiatives to give a  boost  to\r\n\r\nthe  training and  retraining of our workers.  I will deal  with\r\n\r\nthese issues in turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address the concern that the Government does\r\n\r\nnot seem to realise the full extent of the difficulties faced by\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  that it is overly sanguine about  the  economic\r\n\r\noutlook.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry's forecast that the\r\n\r\neconomy will grow between 2.5% and 4.5% in 1998 was made against\r\n\r\na  volatile  regional  backdrop.   It  was  based  on  the  best\r\n\r\navailable  data  on  business  and economic  conditions  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Besides timely hard data on the overall economy and the\r\n\r\nmajor sectors compiled on a monthly and quarterly basis, it  has\r\n\r\nalso taken into account the qualitative first-hand feedback from\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  surveys  of  business  expectations.   Relevant\r\n\r\nstatistics on the economic performance of the OECD countries and\r\n\r\nthe  regional  economies  are also being  closely  monitored  to\r\n\r\nensure early assessment of changes in the economic climate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI's assessment is that while the overall economy is\r\n\r\nexpected  to slow down significantly this year, the impact  will\r\n\r\nbe  uneven  across sectors and businesses.  Businesses servicing\r\n\r\nthe  region  will be affected the most.  Those with revenues  in\r\n\r\nregional  currencies will experience exchange losses.   However,\r\n\r\nmulti-national  companies  and  businesses  servicing  the  OECD\r\n\r\nmarkets  in  the West will not be affected as much.  Those  with\r\n\r\nrevenues  in  US  dollars  may in  fact  have  gained  from  the\r\n\r\nappreciation of the US dollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many SMEs service the regional countries, they have felt\r\n\r\nthe  brunt  of  the regional crisis almost immediately.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore not surprising that feedback from local businesses  is\r\n\r\nthat they are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalready  feeling  the  impact  of  regional  economic  problems.\r\n\r\nHowever,  many  MNCs  and their supporting companies  which  are\r\n\r\nservicing  the  US  and  EU markets are still  enjoying  healthy\r\n\r\ngrowth.   The  US and EU economies are expected to grow  between\r\n\r\n2.5% and 3% respectively this year.  With about half of our non-oil  domestic  exports destined for these markets,  the  current\r\n\r\nassessment  is  that  overall economic growth  this  year  would\r\n\r\nremain  positive,  although significantly lower.   According  to\r\n\r\nMTI,  although  the  January trade and production  figures  were\r\n\r\nweak,  that  was partly statistical, as there were less  working\r\n\r\ndays  this year due to the festive period. Preliminary estimates\r\n\r\nfor  the  two months of January and February this year  indicate\r\n\r\nthat  non-oil domestic exports grew 11.6% compared to  the  same\r\n\r\nperiod  last year.  There is therefore little evidence  at  this\r\n\r\npoint  in time to suggest that the economy will go into negative\r\n\r\ngrowth in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this backdrop that we have come up with the\r\n\r\ncurrent   package   of  relief  measures   for   companies   and\r\n\r\nindividuals.  For businesses in general, which are  expected  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to grow, albeit at a slower rate, we have provided some\r\n\r\nrelief  in the form of property tax rebate, abolition  of  stamp\r\n\r\nduty on most instruments and rental concessions by  JTC and HDB.\r\n\r\nFor the property sector and SMEs which have been more badly hit,\r\n\r\nwe   have  implemented  additional  measures  to  address  their\r\n\r\nspecific  concerns.  These include scaling back the  release  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  land and reinstating the property tax exemption  for\r\n\r\nland under development.  We have also significantly enhanced the\r\n\r\nLocal   Enterprise   Finance  Scheme  to   address   the   SMEs'\r\n\r\ndifficulties in obtaining working capital.  For individuals  and\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  despite slower revenue growth,  we  have  continued\r\n\r\nwith  the  income  tax rebate and the S&C rental  and  utilities\r\n\r\nrebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have expressed the view that the tax and non-tax\r\n\r\nrebates  should not have been revised downwards  from  the  last\r\n\r\nBudget, especially when they are most needed by people in  these\r\n\r\nmore  difficult  times.   There is also a  suggestion  that  the\r\n\r\nrebates should be based on per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapita  income.  Tax and non-tax rebates were given in the  past\r\n\r\nfor  good  economic performance and when budget  surpluses  were\r\n\r\nhealthy.  They were like bonuses given out by companies in  good\r\n\r\nyears.  Generally, in difficult years, no bonuses will be given.\r\n\r\nThese  rebates should not therefore be taken for  granted  as  a\r\n\r\npermanent feature of our budget.  Even without the rebates,  our\r\n\r\npersonal income tax rates are already amongst the lowest in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   The rebates should be seen for what they are -  bonuses\r\n\r\ngiven  in good years.  Although we expect much slower growth  in\r\n\r\n1998, nonetheless a rebate has been given this year, but more as\r\n\r\na  measure  of relief to individuals.  In a period  of  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn, we should expect some belt tightening all round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members felt that the rebates should have been higher,\r\n\r\nciting wage cuts and retrenchments as reasons.  But we have  yet\r\n\r\nto  see across-the-board wage cuts and widespread retrenchments.\r\n\r\nThere  have been some lay-offs, but the retrenched workers  have\r\n\r\nfound  alternative jobs without too much difficulty.   There  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  no  need for significant additional rebates  at  this\r\n\r\ntime.  I  have said that the Government is prepared to  increase\r\n\r\nthe rebates at a later stage if it is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the suggestion that the rebates be based on per\r\n\r\ncapita  household income of HDB households rather than  by  flat\r\n\r\nsize, I agree that  rebates based on per capita income would  be\r\n\r\nmore equitable, but the administrative cost of ascertaining  the\r\n\r\nhousehold income of every HDB household will be prohibitive.  We\r\n\r\nhave  therefore opted for the simpler method of  going  by  flat\r\n\r\nsize as a proxy for household income.  HDB's survey results have\r\n\r\nshown  that the per capita household income generally  increases\r\n\r\nwith the flat size.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The package of relief measures announced in the Budget\r\n\r\nshould be adequate if the economy does indeed grow between  2.5%\r\n\r\nand  4.5% this year, especially if the actual growth is near the\r\n\r\nupper end of the range.  However, the Government also recognises\r\n\r\nthat  the  economic  outlook  is very  uncertain.   If  economic\r\n\r\nconditions should deteriorate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsharply, further relief measures would obviously be called  for.\r\n\r\nI  have  therefore taken pains in my Budget Statement to  stress\r\n\r\nthat  the package of measures is based on current assessment  of\r\n\r\nthe  economic  situation.  If there should be a significant  and\r\n\r\nsudden  downturn,  the Government will not hesitate  to  respond\r\n\r\nwith  off-Budget  measures.   I  want  to  reiterate  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has ample resources and is ready to implement further\r\n\r\nrelief measures where necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members have asked what these additional\r\n\r\nmeasures  would be. These could take the form of  deeper  income\r\n\r\ntax   and  property  tax  rebates  as  well  as  other  measures\r\n\r\nimplemented during the 1985 recession.  There could even be  new\r\n\r\nmeasures  tailored  to  meet the specific  needs  of  particular\r\n\r\nsectors  of the economy.  We will closely monitor the indicators\r\n\r\nfor  any  signs  of deterioration and are prepared  to  step  in\r\n\r\nquickly to cushion the economy from any sudden shocks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have also said that the remedial actions taken\r\n\r\nby Government may come too late.  They prefer Government to take\r\n\r\na  more  proactive approach and do more now, rather  than  react\r\n\r\npassively  to  developments.   But  the  Government   has   been\r\n\r\nproactive  in putting together the current relief  package.   We\r\n\r\nwould  have taken further actions if, by themselves, they  could\r\n\r\nhave   prevented  a  deterioration  of  the  external   economic\r\n\r\nenvironment.  We must remember that, unlike the 1985  recession,\r\n\r\nwe  are  not trying to correct structural weaknesses within  our\r\n\r\neconomy  which require immediate adjustments on our  part.   The\r\n\r\nproblems  we  are facing are externally imposed and  beyond  our\r\n\r\ncontrol.   Given the nature of the problem, we should not  over-react  and  direct  our  resources  aimlessly  now  to  mitigate\r\n\r\nproblems that have yet to arise.  Instead, we would do  well  to\r\n\r\nwait  for  developments to unfold and then  act  decisively  and\r\n\r\npurposefully to offset the impact on the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked if there is a threshold GDP growth\r\n\r\nrate which must be reached before the Government would act.   In\r\n\r\nother words, would the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment intervene only if there were a recession.  I can  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  does not have a  particular  or  absolute\r\n\r\nthreshold GDP figure in mind.  As I have mentioned earlier,  the\r\n\r\nimpact of the regional problems on the economy is expected to be\r\n\r\nuneven.  If the situation for certain sectors should deteriorate\r\n\r\nrapidly,  we  do not have to wait for the whole  economy  to  be\r\n\r\nsimilarly  affected  before taking action.   Further,  while  we\r\n\r\nwould want to base our actions on some hard numbers, instead  of\r\n\r\nrelying  just on anecdotal evidence, we do not have to wait  for\r\n\r\nall  the  hard  numbers  to come in if  the  feedback  from  the\r\n\r\nbusiness   community   corroborates   the   available   economic\r\n\r\nindicators.  In deciding what additional off-Budget measures  to\r\n\r\nintroduce and when to introduce them, we will have to be  guided\r\n\r\nby  both  qualitative and quantitative factors.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwill  keep in close touch with the business community  and  will\r\n\r\nnot hesitate to respond quickly with the appropriate measures as\r\n\r\nand when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal specifically with the concerns of the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector  and the SMEs  over  the  absence  of  new\r\n\r\nincentives for these two sectors.  The perception is that the FY 1998  \r\n\r\nBudget continues to favour the financial sector  and  that\r\n\r\nnot  enough has been done for the other two groups.  The  reason\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government's  focus on the financial  sector  and  its\r\n\r\nseeming  neglect  of  the  manufacturing  and  SME  sectors   is\r\n\r\nstraightforward.   There  already  exists  a  plethora  of   tax\r\n\r\nincentives and assistance schemes created for both manufacturing\r\n\r\nand   the   SMEs   over  the  years.   Pioneer  tax   exemption,\r\n\r\nconcessionary tax rates and other tax incentives which are  only\r\n\r\nnow  being extended to new areas in financial services and cyber\r\n\r\ntrading  have long existed for the manufacturing sector and  the\r\n\r\nSMEs.   All these incentives have worked very well for  the  two\r\n\r\nsectors.   To illustrate, the various tax incentives granted  to\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing sector has resulted in revenue loss  of  more\r\n\r\nthan $500 million in Year of Assessment 1996.  To help companies\r\n\r\nin their business development and skills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nupgrading,  a  block vote of $1.3 billion for  grants  and  $3.3\r\n\r\nbillion  for  loans  have  been set  aside  under  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Assistance Scheme.  In 1994, we also started the  $2\r\n\r\nbillion  Cluster  Development Fund to  enable  EDB  to  go  into\r\n\r\nbusiness  partnerships with companies that  are  venturing  into\r\n\r\npromising  new  areas of business.  To-date,  a  total  of  $794\r\n\r\nmillion from the Cluster Development Fund has been committed  to\r\n\r\nvarious   projects,   of  which  $780  million   was   for   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMEs have long enjoyed Government support. There are\r\n\r\ncurrently  more than 60 programmes to assist SMEs  at  different\r\n\r\nstages  of  development.  The two flag ship programmes  are  the\r\n\r\nLocal   Enterprise  Finance  Scheme  and  the  Local  Enterprise\r\n\r\nTechnical  Assistance Scheme.  In 1997, applications  under  the\r\n\r\ntwo  schemes increased by 13% to about 2,000 compared  to  1,700\r\n\r\napplications  in  1996.  To-date, a typical  SME  applicant  has\r\n\r\nreceived,  on  average, about $800,000 in loans and  $41,000  in\r\n\r\ngrants.  In the FY 1998 Budget, I have announced that the  scope\r\n\r\nof the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme has been extended to make\r\n\r\nshort term loans even more accessible to SMEs to help them  cope\r\n\r\nwith the unexpected economic downturn.  Altogether, $1.1 billion\r\n\r\nhas  been set aside for this purpose.  Other forms of assistance\r\n\r\nare  also  available,  such  as the Local  Enterprise  Upgrading\r\n\r\nCentre,  which  is a first-stop centre to assist SMEs  in  their\r\n\r\ndevelopment programmes.  Since its establishment two years  ago,\r\n\r\nthe  Centre  has  handled more than 6,000 cases  of  assistance.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also a host of training programmes specially tailored\r\n\r\nto meet the needs of SMEs.  A great deal of effort has been made\r\n\r\nto   promote  these  training  programmes,  such  as   providing\r\n\r\nsimplified bilingual application forms and holding of  seminars,\r\n\r\nconferences and the distribution of brochures and so forth.   As\r\n\r\na  result  of these efforts, more than 9,500 SMEs have benefited\r\n\r\nfrom  the  training programmes funded by the Skills  Development\r\n\r\nFund in fiscal year 1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members were disappointed that JTC and HDB are only\r\n\r\nfreezing posted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrentals  and moderating rental adjustments for existing tenants.\r\n\r\nThey  would  have liked to see JTC and HDB rentals  reduced.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  assure Members of the House that  JTC  and  HDB\r\n\r\nrental  reductions are not precluded if conditions  warrant  it.\r\n\r\nFor  the  present,  the  freezing  of  posted  rentals  and  the\r\n\r\nmoderation of rental adjustments where existing rates are  below\r\n\r\nthe posted rates is considered sufficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have also spoken on the need to give greater\r\n\r\nsupport  to training and retraining.  Let me reiterate that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  fully  recognises the  importance  of  training  and\r\n\r\nretraining.   As  our economy continually restructures  to  move\r\n\r\ninto  more higher value-added activities, constant upgrading  of\r\n\r\nthe  skills of our workforce is paramount.  I will touch briefly\r\n\r\non  a  number of new training schemes launched recently  or  are\r\n\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC first launched the Skills Redevelopment Programme\r\n\r\n(SRP)  in 1996 to equip lower educated workers with the relevant\r\n\r\nskills needed to enhance their employability.  The programme  is\r\n\r\nsupported  by PSB, EDB and ITE.  The SDF provides up to  80%  of\r\n\r\nthe course fee and EDB defrays up to 70% of the absentee payroll\r\n\r\nthrough  its INTECH grant scheme.  Some 50 companies, mainly  in\r\n\r\nthe electronics industry, have signed up about 5,000 workers for\r\n\r\nthe SRP.  Around 1,000 workers have started training.  More than\r\n\r\n50% of the trainees are aged 40 and above.  The expansion of the\r\n\r\nSRP into a national programme is now being considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A \"People Developer\" Scheme was launched in December 1997\r\n\r\nto recognise companies with comprehensive systems for developing\r\n\r\nstaff.   SDF  is  providing  80% of  the  consultancy  cost  for\r\n\r\nimplementing  the  scheme.   A new National  Skills  Recognition\r\n\r\nSystem  will be piloted in the second half of 1998.  The  system\r\n\r\nwill  certify worker skills and provide a progression  path  for\r\n\r\nthe workforce, thereby encouraging workers to raise their skills\r\n\r\nbase  and help employers reward skill attainments.  PSB is  also\r\n\r\nworking  on  a  Critical Enabling Skills  Programme  (CREST)  to\r\n\r\nprepare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe workforce for a knowledge-based economy.  The programme aims\r\n\r\nto equip 50% of the workforce with competency in key skill areas\r\n\r\nsuch  as  learning-to-learn,  group effectiveness,  organisation\r\n\r\neffectiveness and leadership by the Year 2005.  It  is  expected\r\n\r\nto  be  launched  in the second half of 1998.   A  Job  Redesign\r\n\r\nProgramme   is   also  being  redeveloped  to   help   companies\r\n\r\nrestructure  their jobs and processes for greater  productivity.\r\n\r\nPSB   will   provide  training  and  consultancy  to   companies\r\n\r\ninterested in the programme with funding from the SDF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the SDF provides between 50% and 80% funding for\r\n\r\nthe  course  fees  of the programmes it supports.   Total  grant\r\n\r\ncommitments  made  by SDF in the fiscal year 1996  rose  to  $72\r\n\r\nmillion compared to $68 million in FY 1995.  Should there  be  a\r\n\r\ndip  in  the  pace of training over the next one  or  two  years\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  economic slowdown, SDF  is  also  prepared  to\r\n\r\nincrease  its  support level selectively in  critical  areas  of\r\n\r\ntraining.  Government will also consider supplementing SDF  with\r\n\r\nadditional funding, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I move on to address other concerns by Members,\r\n\r\nallow  me to restate the basic tenets of the Government's fiscal\r\n\r\npolicy.  In years of strong economic growth, our aim is  to  run\r\n\r\nbudget  surpluses to augment our foreign reserves.  The reserves\r\n\r\nare  a buffer against unforeseen shocks to our economy.  Members\r\n\r\nwill   have  seen  how  important  financial  reserves  are   in\r\n\r\ninstilling  confidence among investors in our economy.   If  not\r\n\r\nfor our large stockpile of reserves, we would have been buffeted\r\n\r\nmuch more by the regional turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulation of reserves, however, is not achieved at\r\n\r\nthe expense of heavy taxes that burden the economy.  This is  in\r\n\r\nline with another basic tenet of our fiscal policy, which is  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  competitive tax regime which taxes the  factors  of\r\n\r\nproduction as lightly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fiscal policy has served us well. When times are not\r\n\r\nso  good, as is now, we will be prudent and target for a reduced\r\n\r\nsurplus.   But  when  times are bad, we are prepared  to  run  a\r\n\r\nbudget deficit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  draw down on reserves, as we did during the 1985 recession.\r\n\r\nOver the years, we have also lowered our tax rates progressively\r\n\r\nto  ensure that they remain competitive.  Our current tax regime\r\n\r\nis  still  competitive.  We have a wide range of tax incentives,\r\n\r\nwhich  means that the actual average rate of tax is  lower  than\r\n\r\nthe  corporate  tax rate of 26%.  Our extensive network  of  tax\r\n\r\ntreaties  also help to lighten the burden of companies operating\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   We  have  been  consistent  in  maintaining   a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  tax  regime  and will not hesitate  to  adjust  the\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax  rate  if  there is  a  need  to  strengthen  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to specific concerns raised by other\r\n\r\nMembers.  But first, I will deal with some misplaced suggestions\r\n\r\nfrom  the  NCMP and the Opposition Members.  Both  Mr  Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  and  Mr Jeyaretnam have asked that the GST be suspended.\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam claimed that GST would raise prices significantly\r\n\r\nbut  that Government had nonetheless introduced the tax  because\r\n\r\nit  would generate significant revenue.  He also suggested  that\r\n\r\nbasic necessities be exempted from GST.  Mr Jeyaretnam may  like\r\n\r\nto  know that the Cost Review Committee had in 1996 studied  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  GST  on  the  cost of living of  Singaporeans.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee  concluded that GST did not cause prices to shoot  up.\r\n\r\nInstead, it resulted in only a one-off rise in the CPI  in  1994\r\n\r\nof  less than one percentage point.  Inflation in that year also\r\n\r\nremained low at 3.1%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the claim that the Government had introduced GST to\r\n\r\nraise  additional  revenue, I would like to point out  that  GST\r\n\r\nhas  remained revenue negative every year since its introduction\r\n\r\nin  1994 because of the accompanying cuts in direct and indirect\r\n\r\ntaxes  and the generous GST offset package introduced.   In  the\r\n\r\nfour  years  between FY94 and FY97, total GST  collections  were\r\n\r\n$6.7 billion.  But the total revenue loss in the same period was\r\n\r\n$8.2  billion.   The  net revenue loss to  Government  was  $1.5\r\n\r\nbillion  in the last four years.  If we were to suspend GST,  it\r\n\r\nwould result in a further revenue loss of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$2  billion a year.  Even if we need to stimulate the economy by\r\n\r\n$2  billion, suspending GST across the board may not be the best\r\n\r\nway  to  do  it.   We would do better to adopt a  more  targeted\r\n\r\napproach  and apply the money judiciously to specific areas  and\r\n\r\ngroups which are more in need of help from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Jeyaretnam's suggestion to exempt basic\r\n\r\nnecessities  from GST, the matter has been discussed  at  length\r\n\r\nbefore  the implementation of GST.  But I will repeat the  basic\r\n\r\nconsiderations here for his benefit.  The GST is designed to  be\r\n\r\ncomprehensive to keep the GST system simple, thereby the cost of\r\n\r\nadministration  low.   To single out items for  exemption  would\r\n\r\ncomplicate  the  entire  GST system and  increase  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the tax.  This has been  the  experience  of\r\n\r\nother  countries where such exemptions are allowed.  It is  also\r\n\r\nnot  an  effective way to help the lower income  households.   A\r\n\r\nsurvey  on the expenditure of households conducted prior to  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  GST  showed  that  exempting  food  and  other\r\n\r\nnecessities  from GST will benefit the more well-off  much  more\r\n\r\nthan  the  lower  income households.  According  to  the  study,\r\n\r\nexempting food as a whole from GST will benefit the high  income\r\n\r\nhouseholds   3.5  times  as  much  as  from  the  lower   income\r\n\r\nhouseholds, and exempting health expenses or education from  GST\r\n\r\nwill  benefit high income households eight times as much as  the\r\n\r\nlower income households.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also asked whether there was a need to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with the water conservation tax now that there  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  any  threat that our water supply will be cut  off.   He\r\n\r\nalso  asked what the $2.3 billion of \"Other Taxes\" meant.  Water\r\n\r\nis,  and will always remain, an important strategic resource for\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The water conservation tax was intended to  promote\r\n\r\nwater   conservation  and  slow  down  the   growth   in   water\r\n\r\nconsumption.   The  objectives of the tax  remain  relevant  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason to abolish it.  The \"Other Taxes\" which  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam referred to is mainly foreign workers' levy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has said that rebates to individuals are\r\n\r\nnot significant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  that the assistance to businesses also did little to reduce\r\n\r\ntheir fixed operating costs.  On personal income tax rebates  to\r\n\r\nindividuals,  I would like to remind Mr Low that the  5%  rebate\r\n\r\ngiven  is at the same level of that which was given between  the\r\n\r\nyears  1990 and 1994.  It was only in recent years that we  have\r\n\r\ngiven  a  rebate  of  10%.   A  5%  income  tax  rebate  is  not\r\n\r\ninsignificant.  And as I have said, the Government  is  prepared\r\n\r\nto  increase  the  rebate  if this was found  to  be  necessary.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  for  assistance  to companies,  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nprovide more relief measures, if these are needed.  But  Mr  Low\r\n\r\nis  correct that there are certain costs faced by companies over\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government can do little.  These include wage  costs\r\n\r\nand interest costs which are determined by market forces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong has berated the Government for stopping\r\n\r\ntransfers  to  Edusave and Medifund in this  year's  Budget.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to remind Mr Chiam that in FY97, the Government  made\r\n\r\nits  final contribution of $500 million to the Edusave Endowment\r\n\r\nFund  to reach the targeted fund total of $5 billion.  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nshould  congratulate the Government for the early fulfilment  of\r\n\r\nits commitment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Medical Endowment Fund, I have already informed\r\n\r\nthe  House  in  my  Budget Statement that  there  is  more  than\r\n\r\nadequate  income from this fund to meet projected  disbursements\r\n\r\nin  FY98.   Hence, there will be no curtailment in disbursements\r\n\r\nfrom both the Edusave and Medical Endowment Funds this year  for\r\n\r\nlack of funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has also suggested that the Government allow\r\n\r\nretrenched workers to draw parts of their CPF.  Mr Chiam must be\r\n\r\naware  that  the  CPF savings are meant for members'  retirement\r\n\r\nneeds.  Allowing withdrawals of CPF savings for short-term needs\r\n\r\nwill severely affect the retirement needs of Singaporeans in the\r\n\r\nlong  run.   Easy  withdrawal  of CPF  may  also  undermine  the\r\n\r\nincentive for workers to seek alternative employment or  undergo\r\n\r\ntraining and upgrading in the event of unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has also accused the Government of not keeping to\r\n\r\nits electoral\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromise  of  continuing  with the Main Upgrading  Programme.   I\r\n\r\nwould  also  like  to  remind Mr Chiam that the  Government  has\r\n\r\nalways  said that the pace of the Main Upgrading Programme  will\r\n\r\nbe  determined by the size of the budget surplus.   With  slower\r\n\r\neconomic  growth and lower budget surpluses, the MUP  programmes\r\n\r\nhave been adjusted downwards, but Mr Chiam should note that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will continue to spend a substantial $480 million for\r\n\r\nthe Main and Interim Upgrading Programmes in this year's Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members have also expressed concern that the Budget\r\n\r\nhad  not  offered  much  assistance to the  retail  and  tourism\r\n\r\nsectors, and that the reduction in personal income tax rebate to\r\n\r\n5% would, in fact, withdraw greater liquidity and further dampen\r\n\r\nthe  retail sector.  As I have said earlier, the personal income\r\n\r\ntax rebate is a reward for good economic performance.  Moreover,\r\n\r\ngiven  the  current cautious consumer spending mood,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that a higher income tax rebate would offer much help  to\r\n\r\nthe retail sector.  Government already has various programmes in\r\n\r\nplace  which provide assistance in funding for both  the  retail\r\n\r\nand   tourism  sectors.   For  instance,  Government  has   been\r\n\r\nenhancing retail infrastructure and providing upgrading in areas\r\n\r\nsuch  as stock control, shop management and staff retraining  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  competitiveness and resilience of  our  retailers.\r\n\r\nFor  the tourism sector, the Singapore Tourism Board also  helps\r\n\r\nindustry  members  to  obtain financial  and  manpower  training\r\n\r\nassistance  from  schemes  such as  the  Innovation  Development\r\n\r\nScheme  and Initiatives for New Technology (INTECH) Scheme.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  approved  tourism  projects  can  also  qualify   for\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Building  Allowances,  Investment   Allowances   on\r\n\r\napproved expenditure as well as property tax concessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Swee Say has asked whether more funds could be\r\n\r\nallocated to the EDB and other economic agencies, to enable them\r\n\r\nto take the opportunity to attract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore investments into Singapore.  I would like to assure Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is always open to opportunities to  attract\r\n\r\ninvestments  into  Singapore.  In FY98,  $176  million  will  be\r\n\r\nprovided for EDAS grants, compared with $131 million in FY97,  a\r\n\r\n34%  increase.  We are prepared to increase the funding if  this\r\n\r\nshould prove necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked for rebates or concessions to be given\r\n\r\nto  promote  savings.  As a general rule,  we  do  not  want  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish between different types of income for tax  purposes,\r\n\r\nas  it  could  otherwise  result in  economic  distortions,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  it could skew investment decisions if interest  income\r\n\r\nwas  favoured  over, say, dividend income.  There  is  also  the\r\n\r\nquestion of equity.  Generally, those who derive the same income\r\n\r\nshould  pay the same amount of taxes.  If we were to selectively\r\n\r\nexempt certain types of income, we could have an anomaly of high\r\n\r\nincome  earners  paying very little taxes  if  their  income  is\r\n\r\nmainly from tax-exempt sources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Ravindran have suggested that we\r\n\r\nprovide relief for mortgage loans, similar to what Hong Kong did\r\n\r\nin  its FY98 budget.  I should point out that in Hong Kong, most\r\n\r\npeople  live in privately owned housing which is very expensive.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  Hong  Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar,  interest\r\n\r\nrates  are  also much higher than in Singapore.  Hong Kong  home\r\n\r\nowners,  therefore,  pay hefty mortgage  rates,  hence  mortgage\r\n\r\nrelief  is needed.  In the case of Singapore, more than  85%  of\r\n\r\nour  population  live  in  HDB  flats  and  they  already  enjoy\r\n\r\nsubsidies,  not only on the purchase price of their  flats,  but\r\n\r\nalso on the low mortgage interest payments.  Therefore, there is\r\n\r\nno need to provide further tax reliefs on mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad has asked that a multi-tier corporate tax\r\n\r\nsystem,  with lower tax rates for smaller companies, be adopted.\r\n\r\nThis was raised in last year's Budget debate and I would like to\r\n\r\nreiterate that a multi-tier tax system will create opportunities\r\n\r\nfor tax planning, such as a breaking-up of companies to pay less\r\n\r\ntax.   To  guard  against these, elaborate tax  rules  would  be\r\n\r\nneeded, which will lead to higher tax compliance cost.  Having a\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntax  rate  may also not help smaller companies in their start-up\r\n\r\nphase  anyway, since they will not be paying much taxes  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst place during their start-up phase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked why the property tax rebate was\r\n\r\nextended only to industrial and commercial properties,  but  not\r\n\r\nresidential properties.  The property tax rebate was granted  to\r\n\r\nease  the  cost  of  business.  In the case of  individuals  and\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  it is more meaningful to extend income  tax  rebate\r\n\r\nand  rebates  on  service  and conservancy  charges  and  rental\r\n\r\ncharges.  Home owners are already taxed at a lower concessionary\r\n\r\ntax  rate  of  4%  on  the  annual value  of  their  properties.\r\n\r\nFurther,  with  the  property tax rebates given  since  1994  to\r\n\r\noffset GST, currently the majority of HDB households living in 1- to 4-room flats do not pay any property tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also spoke on the unhappiness of house owners in\r\n\r\nhaving to resolve disputes over their annual value of properties\r\n\r\nwith  IRAS.  It is the duty of the Chief Assessor to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  annual value conforms to the statutory definition of  being\r\n\r\nthe  estimated annual rental that the property can fetch in  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   Home  owners  can object to any adjustments  of  their\r\n\r\nannual  value within 21 days of the notice to adjust the  value.\r\n\r\nHome  owners  simply  need to complete a one-page  form  stating\r\n\r\ntheir grounds of objection.  The Chief Assessor will review  and\r\n\r\nadjust  annual values accordingly if there are valid grounds  of\r\n\r\nobjection.  If home owners disagree with the valuation, they can\r\n\r\nappeal to an independent Valuation Review Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan and Dr Wang Kai Yuen expressed concern\r\n\r\nover  the  recent upward revision on the annual values  of  some\r\n\r\nproperties.   Since  January this year, IRAS has  been  actively\r\n\r\nreviewing  properties  with  a view  to  reducing  their  annual\r\n\r\nvalues, where warranted.  To-date, IRAS has reviewed some 22,000\r\n\r\ncases  and  reduced the annual rental values by  more  than  $78\r\n\r\nmillion.  This reduction in annual values came from 37%  of  the\r\n\r\ncases  reviewed.  63% had their annual values retained and  only\r\n\r\n1% of the cases had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  annual  values increased based on market evidence.   IRAS\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  further reduce the annual values  where  the\r\n\r\nmarket  warrants  it.  Property owners who  have  reduced  their\r\n\r\nrentals  could  also inform IRAS so that IRAS could  initiate  a\r\n\r\nreview and reduce the annual values promptly and accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has commented that there is too much\r\n\r\nGovernment  intervention in the property market.   He  commented\r\n\r\nthat  Government should just set the overall framework to  guard\r\n\r\nagainst  asset inflation and leave the market to just  find  its\r\n\r\nown  level.  Mr Singh, Mr Simon Tay and Mr Chuang Shaw Peng also\r\n\r\nechoed  the  sentiment  that too much may  have  been  given  to\r\n\r\ndevelopers  which are still expected to make reasonable  profits\r\n\r\neven after making loss provisions on unsold units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's long-term strategy is to supply sufficient\r\n\r\nland at a steady pace to meet the aspirations of Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nown private residential properties.  However, given the cyclical\r\n\r\nnature  of  the property market, it is inevitable that  property\r\n\r\nprices will rise and fall.  The Government will not intervene in\r\n\r\nthe  property  market  except when  it  is  necessary  to  avoid\r\n\r\nexcessive  market volatility.  This is because extreme  ups  and\r\n\r\ndowns  in  the  property market could have  a  severe  and  long\r\n\r\nlasting   impact   on  the  real  economy.   Hence,   Government\r\n\r\nintroduced  anti-speculation measures in May 1996 to  prick  the\r\n\r\nspeculative  bubble  and to cool down the  residential  property\r\n\r\nmarket.  Similarly, in the present downturn, attributable to the\r\n\r\nregional economic turmoil, Government has adjusted its land sale\r\n\r\nprogramme to avoid exacerbating an over-supply situation.  It is\r\n\r\nnot the Government's intention to ensure that developers make  a\r\n\r\nprofit.   Like  any other businesses, they will have  to  assess\r\n\r\nbusiness risks and face the consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan has commented that many younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are graduates find that they still cannot  meet\r\n\r\nthe  20%  cash  payment  for the purchase  of  private  property\r\n\r\ndespite  the  falling property prices.  He  suggested  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should allow for a reduced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10% cash payment for first-time owners of private property.   Mr\r\n\r\nChoo Wee Khiang and Mr Zulkifli both suggested allowing the  use\r\n\r\nof CPF for the down-payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 80% limit on bank financing of property purchases is a\r\n\r\nprudential measure to ensure that the banking sector is not over-exposed  to  the  property sector and that home owners  are  not\r\n\r\nheavily  geared  and  hence vulnerable to  a  fall  in  property\r\n\r\nprices.   In  countries  such as Hong Kong  and  Malaysia,  even\r\n\r\nstricter  limits  are  imposed on banks  in  financing  property\r\n\r\npurchases.  It would not be prudent to relax the 80% limit, even\r\n\r\nselectively  for first-time buyers.  To do so would  reduce  the\r\n\r\nbuffer  which  banks  have in the event  of  default  where  the\r\n\r\npledged properties have to be disposed of at lower prices.   CPF\r\n\r\nsavings cannot be used as the buffer because they go back to the\r\n\r\nbuyer's CPF account if the property is resold.  Furthermore, any\r\n\r\nconcession to be granted to only a select group of buyers  could\r\n\r\neasily  be  subject  to  abuse.  Home  buyers  should  therefore\r\n\r\nconsider their financial position carefully before purchasing  a\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has commented that GLCs should be subject\r\n\r\nto  greater  accountability  to  make  sure  that  public  money\r\n\r\ninvested in GLCs is well spent and that there should be  greater\r\n\r\ndisclosure  on  their investments as recommended by  the  Public\r\n\r\nAccounts Committee.  Government is conscious that a considerable\r\n\r\namount  of public money has been invested in our GLCs.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore like to assure Members of the House that our GLCs have\r\n\r\nbeen  profitable and represent good investments of public money.\r\n\r\nAlthough  some  of  the investments made by our  GLCs  have  not\r\n\r\nturned  out  as  expected, we should not over react.   Many  are\r\n\r\npublic  listed companies and their accounts are open  to  public\r\n\r\nscrutiny.  Most of these have performed well over the years  and\r\n\r\nhave contributed substantially to public coffers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked whether greater efficiency has been\r\n\r\nachieved  as  a  result  of  the corporatisation  of  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  and  whether the interest of the consumers  have  been\r\n\r\nprotected.  The objective of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorporatisation programme is to enable the service  provider  to\r\n\r\noperate  as  a  business entity so that it  will  be  efficient,\r\n\r\nbottom-line driven and be responsive to changes in a competitive\r\n\r\nenvironment and the demands of its customers.  Towards this end,\r\n\r\nGovernment has been liberalising the telecommunication  industry\r\n\r\nin a gradual manner and we have clearly seen and experienced the\r\n\r\nbenefits  in  terms  of  more competitive  pricing  and  greater\r\n\r\nconsumer  choice.   However,  in situations  where  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncorporatised  monopoly, as in the case of Singapore  Power,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  regulatory body, in this case,  PUB,  would  play  a\r\n\r\ncritical  role in regulating tariff charges to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ncharges are fair.  I would like to assure Members of this  House\r\n\r\nthat  our  regulatory bodies are vigilant in ensuring  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests   of  the  consumers  are  safeguarded.   During   the\r\n\r\ntransitory  period between corporatisation and the  introduction\r\n\r\nof competition, the regulator will monitor the situation closely\r\n\r\nto keep tab on charges and service quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members have asked whether Government would freeze\r\n\r\nutilities charges and other Government fees to reduce the burden\r\n\r\non  businesses and individuals.  Government fees and charges are\r\n\r\nrevised only to keep pace with cost increases.  If cost had  not\r\n\r\nincreased, fees and charges would also not increase.  Our policy\r\n\r\nhas  been  to  revise  fees and charges regularly  so  that  the\r\n\r\nincreases  can  be kept small.  The revisions  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  services  are  properly  priced  to  guard   against\r\n\r\nmisallocation  of  resources.   However,  the  Government   will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to monitor the situation closely and will  review  the\r\n\r\nfees and charges if there is a need to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh have commented\r\n\r\non the depreciation of regional currencies against the Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar and said that it is now an opportune time to escalate the\r\n\r\npace  of  regionalisation  and  promote  the  establishment   of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  bases in the region.  The recent  devaluation  of\r\n\r\nregional  currencies  relative  to  the  Singapore  dollar  does\r\n\r\nprovide opportunities for our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompanies   to  further  invest  in  the  region.   Whilst   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can give assistance to our companies by highlighting\r\n\r\nthe  opportunities  that  are  available  and  facilitating  the\r\n\r\ninvestments, ultimately the companies themselves must assess the\r\n\r\nrisks involved and decide whether it is commercially viable  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  expand their activities in the region.  For those  who\r\n\r\nare  willing and able to undertake further regional investments,\r\n\r\nthere  already exists a comprehensive range of tax and financial\r\n\r\nincentives   to   assist   them.    Incentives   such   as   the\r\n\r\nRegionalisation  Financing  Scheme,  Local  Enterprise   Finance\r\n\r\nScheme,  Overseas  Enterprise Incentive and Overseas  Investment\r\n\r\nIncentive have been used extensively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has asked whether Government would\r\n\r\nconsider allowing workers to use a portion of their CPF  savings\r\n\r\nfor  an unemployment benefits scheme as part of a crisis package\r\n\r\nto  be  invoked  only when there is a severe economic  downturn.\r\n\r\nThere  are  no  plans to set up such a scheme at  present.   The\r\n\r\nproposal has to be carefully considered in view of the long-term\r\n\r\nimplications  on the labour market and costs of employment.   In\r\n\r\ntimes of economic recession, the best way to help workers is  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them get jobs and upgrade their skills so that they remain\r\n\r\nemployable.   Currently,  there are more  than  450,000  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  in  Singapore.  In an extreme situation, we can  adjust\r\n\r\nthe dependency ratio to reduce the influx of foreign workers and\r\n\r\nto  assist  our  own  retrenched  workers  to  find  alternative\r\n\r\nemployment.  These measures would help our workers cope  without\r\n\r\nhaving  to establish an unemployment benefits scheme as a  basic\r\n\r\nsafety  net.  Experience in other countries serves to remind  us\r\n\r\nthat  the best security net for Singaporeans is not unemployment\r\n\r\nor   welfare   benefits   but  constant  growth   and   manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has also commented that as manpower development\r\n\r\nis critical, the Government should allocate sufficient resources\r\n\r\nto the new Ministry of Manpower (MOM).  As part of the effort to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  Singapore's  global competitiveness,  Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace  all manpower planning, development and management  issues\r\n\r\nunder the charge of a single Ministry.  As a central agency, the\r\n\r\nnew  Ministry  will  be in a better position to  coordinate  all\r\n\r\ncritical  manpower  planning  and management  issues.   The  new\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  also put greater emphasis on collaboration  with\r\n\r\nits  partners, which include the private sector, the unions  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies,  so that it will  be  able  to  align  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  all  stakeholders to our national manpower  vision.\r\n\r\nGovernment is committed to the development of manpower and  will\r\n\r\nensure that sufficient financial resources are made available to\r\n\r\nMOM.   If additional funds are required, my Ministry is prepared\r\n\r\nto consider such requests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang has noted that MCD had the second lowest\r\n\r\nbudget  and had urged the Government to allocate a larger budget\r\n\r\nfor  the  community services sector.  She further observed  that\r\n\r\nMCD's  budget  was even lower than that of the  Police  Division\r\n\r\nunder  MHA.   Instead of allocating a huge budget to  MHA  whose\r\n\r\nfocus  is  on  remedial action, resources should be  shifted  to\r\n\r\npreventive action undertaken by MCD.  But I would like to  point\r\n\r\nout  that  MCD's  budget  alone is  not  representative  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   spending  on  community   development.    Besides\r\n\r\nCommunity   Development,  Government's  spending  on  Education,\r\n\r\nHealth, Information and the Arts, Environment as well as  Public\r\n\r\nHousing all contribute to the social and community well-being of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Total Government's spending on social and  community\r\n\r\nservices,  which include these six named areas, will  amount  to\r\n\r\n$10.3  billion  or  37.6% of FY1998 Budget.  The  community  and\r\n\r\nsocial   services  sector  in  fact  will  receive  the  highest\r\n\r\nallocation of resources in FY1998.  Further, it is incorrect  to\r\n\r\nsay  that MCD's focus is on taking preventive action while  that\r\n\r\nof  MHA is on remedial action.  A very significant proportion of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Home Affairs' resources has always been devoted\r\n\r\nto  preventive programmes, such as crime prevention, fire safety\r\n\r\nand  drug education.  We should see spending in these programmes\r\n\r\nas  complementary  to the other programmes  in  the  social  and\r\n\r\ncommunity services sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang would also be pleased to know that MCD would be\r\n\r\nembarking  on a national study on the state of our families  and\r\n\r\nanother  on the impact of maids on childcare.  In addition,  MCD\r\n\r\nhas  increased the number of neighbourhood centres which include\r\n\r\nchildcare  centres,  youth drop-in programmes  and  centres  for\r\n\r\nelderly  services.  MCD will also be looking into  the  manpower\r\n\r\nneeds  for the social service sector and will be working closely\r\n\r\nwith the voluntary organisations in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has urged the Government not to neglect\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  the softer aspects of life through involvement  in\r\n\r\ncharity and the arts, and has suggested that Government maintain\r\n\r\nits  commitment in these areas during these hard times.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure  the  Member that sufficient  funds  have  been\r\n\r\nprovided to arts and culture and community development and  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no cut-back on Government's commitment in  these  two\r\n\r\nareas.   For the voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs)  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health and the Ministry of Community  Development,\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  providing $140 million of grants  in  FY1998  as\r\n\r\ncompared to $96 million provided in FY1997.  As for the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Information and the Arts, the FY1998 budget is $381  million\r\n\r\nas compared to $318 million in FY1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two days of debate, several Members have spoken\r\n\r\non the subject of bond-breaking by public sector scholars.  I do\r\n\r\nnot  propose to comment on this issue.  However, DPM BG Lee will\r\n\r\nbe making a Ministerial Statement on this subject tomorrow after\r\n\r\nQuestion Time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me sum up by emphasising to Members of\r\n\r\nthis  House that the Government is fully aware of the extent  of\r\n\r\nthe economic slowdown and is carefully monitoring its impact  on\r\n\r\nthe  population and the different sectors of the  economy.   The\r\n\r\ncrisis  has not run its full course and we must maintain a  cool\r\n\r\nhead  to  anticipate and deal with developments as yet  unknown.\r\n\r\nIn  this  respect,  I  thank  the  Members  of  this  House  for\r\n\r\nsignposting  possible areas of concern.
