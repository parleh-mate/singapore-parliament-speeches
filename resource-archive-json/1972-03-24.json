In\r\n\r\nview  of  the  remarks I made regarding  the  slow\r\n\r\nprogress  d  building that was going on,  I  would\r\n\r\ncertainly  support  this  project  wholeheartedly,\r\n\r\nbecause  a  place  where justice  is  administered\r\n\r\nshould   reflect  the  fresh,  crisp,  and   clean\r\n\r\natmosphere   and  appearance  which  characterises\r\n\r\nSingapore.

This land is adjacent to the\r\n\r\nnew  Motor Vehicles Inspection Centre at the  Sin\r\n\r\nMing  Road  site, which has a total area  of  2.4\r\n\r\nacres, if we combine the two areas, we shall have\r\n\r\na  new  R.O.V, headquarters occupying almost  six\r\n\r\nacres of land. It is, therefore, our ultimate aim\r\n\r\nto remove completely the R.O.V, headquarters from\r\n\r\nMiddle Road to the Sin Ming Road site. Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  begin first with the new Inspection\r\n\r\nCentre  at Sin Ming Road, so as to cope with  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  demand for the inspection  of  public\r\n\r\nservice  vehicles.

At the moment  101\r\n\r\nHonours  students, 120 Pre-university students  and 27   Russian  and  American  students  of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity   are   all  housed   in   Jurong   Town\r\n\r\nCorporation flats. Because of a shortage of hostels\r\n\r\nfor girls, three students' hostels and another half\r\n\r\nmeant for boys have been converted into hostels for\r\n\r\ngirls.   So  those  local  students  who  ask   for\r\n\r\nallocation   of  accommodation  in  the  University\r\n\r\nhostels are not allowed because they must give  way\r\n\r\nto foreign students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now there is a request for a revote. With the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of Nanyang University, there  will  be\r\n\r\nmore   students  requiring  hostel  facilities   in\r\n\r\nNanyang   University.  Two-thirds   of   the   land\r\n\r\nbelonging to Nanyang University are not being used.\r\n\r\nSince  Nanyang University had asked for a vote  for\r\n\r\nstudents  hostels  and the vote was  approved  last\r\n\r\nyear,  how is it that this vote is carried  forward\r\n\r\nto  this  year? If we have to wait for the approval\r\n\r\nof  the  10-year development plan,  then  with  the\r\n\r\npresent  administration of Nanyang University,  the\r\n\r\nbuilding of students' hostels will not be in  sight\r\n\r\nfor  a  very  long time. It is the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to assist Nanyang University in building\r\n\r\nhostels.   I  do  not  know  whether  the   10-year\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plan has been accepted or not;  anyway\r\n\r\nthe   details   have   not  been   announced.   The\r\n\r\ndevelopment  plan and the hostels are two  separate\r\n\r\nmatters;  they are not closely related.

Universities  are   not   built   and\r\n\r\ndeveloped just for today, for tomorrow, or for  the\r\n\r\nyear. They are built to stay for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nTherefore, any physical development programme  must\r\n\r\nbe  considered  in the greatest detail.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nbuild  a cluster of concrete buildings just because\r\n\r\nthere  happened to be some empty space, or  because\r\n\r\nit  is  the most suitable development to  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds  for  the present. I believe it  is  in  this\r\n\r\ncontext that the Member for Jurong last year  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  a Master Plan was being prepared  for  the\r\n\r\nNanyang University. I believe Members know  that  a\r\n\r\n10-year development programme has been prepared and\r\n\r\nis  under  active consideration by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.  The  building of students  hostels  and\r\n\r\nother  forms of development are part and parcel  of\r\n\r\nthe  total  physical  development  of  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  and  therefore the matter  has  to  be\r\n\r\nlooked, into very closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (In Mandarin.):</b> Sir, it goes\r\n\r\nwithout  saying  that we must build in  preparation\r\n\r\nfor  their use for the next 100 years or more.  But\r\n\r\nat the moment the students have no place to put up.\r\n\r\nBefore  you  can  finish your  10-year  development\r\n\r\nprogramme, the lot of them will not be able to live\r\n\r\nanywhere within the University campus. They have to\r\n\r\nput  up  in flats in Jurong Town together with  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  Perhaps because of the  present  lack  of\r\n\r\nhostels,  many students are not able  to  join  the\r\n\r\nNanyang University. So you must have both the long-term plan and also the short-term plan. I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will answer this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, in order to get over the\r\n\r\nshort-term problems, I think the Member knows that\r\n\r\nwe have certain accommodation facilities in Jurong\r\n\r\nTown   made   available  to   Nanyang   University\r\n\r\nstudents.  To solve this problem further,  perhaps\r\n\r\nwe  can  look into the possibility of renting  out\r\n\r\npremises or quarters returned to us by the British\r\n\r\nForces on their withdrawal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point I would like to make about\r\n\r\nthis  question of travelling. I think our students\r\n\r\nare  being a bit spoilt! I do not see what  is  so\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  travel  six  miles  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity to study. I used to travel 12 miles  to\r\n\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

But\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  Singapore. We  cannot  compare  our\r\n\r\nsituation with conditions overseas. At the present\r\n\r\nmoment,  there are 92 units of J.T.C, flats  made\r\n\r\navailable  for  Nanyang University  students,  but\r\n\r\nonly  half  of  them  are  occupied.  Perhaps  our\r\n\r\nNanyang University undergraduates are not prepared\r\n\r\nto  live  in  the J.T.C, housing estates,  because\r\n\r\nthey  would  have no choice but to travel  a  long\r\n\r\ndistance to attend lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will ask for more money from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance to build more hostels.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand   that  at  the  present   moment   two\r\n\r\nbuildings  have  been put up by  the  Hokien  Huay\r\n\r\nKuan, but these are not related to the development\r\n\r\nplan   of  the  University.

After revision and  reassessment,\r\n\r\nanother  request  was made for $1.2  million,  but\r\n\r\nthis  was  turned down. In order  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nurgent  needs  of students for sports  facilities,\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang University have condescended  to  cut\r\n\r\ndown  their  original request for an Olympic-sized\r\n\r\nswimming  pool for the sports complex. Because  of\r\n\r\nthat,  the  sum was reduced from $1.2  million  to\r\n\r\n$900,000,  but the request for this sum of  money,\r\n\r\nwhich  was made to the Ministry of Education,  has\r\n\r\nso far not been approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Nanyang University urgently requires a\r\n\r\nsports  complex. This time last year when we  were\r\n\r\ndebating  the  same  item  under  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates,  the Minister of State agreed  with  me\r\n\r\nthat  of  these  three items  in  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates - students' hostels, staff quarters  and\r\n\r\nsports  complex  - the most urgent were  students'\r\n\r\nhostels  and  the  sports  complex.  Sir,  at  the\r\n\r\npresent   moment   whenever  it   rains   in   the\r\n\r\nUniversity, all sports or physical activities have\r\n\r\nto   be  stopped,  because  these  activities  are\r\n\r\ncarried  out in the open air and it is  impossible\r\n\r\nto  carry on in the rain. The building of a sports\r\n\r\ncomplex  will not only solve the present needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  students but will also provide facilities for\r\n\r\nthe  training of coaches and instructors  for  the\r\n\r\nvarious  schools in Singapore. There is no  reason\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister for Education not to press  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance  further  for  the  vote  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the  building of the sports  complex  as\r\n\r\nearly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid\r\n\r\nwe are more ambitious than the Member for Delta.

In his\r\n\r\nanswer  to  my question just now, the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for  Education said that  his  Ministry  was\r\n\r\nstill  considering the 10-year development plan  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the building of new secondary schools  would\r\n\r\ndepend on the needs of the various constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister of State to take\r\n\r\nnote of the statistics I am going to quote, which I\r\n\r\nhope will help him in his consideration of the  10-year  development  plan. According  to  the  census\r\n\r\ntaken  in  1970,  Bukit  Ho Swee  had  about  7,363\r\n\r\nchildren  between  the ages of  10  and  14;  Delta\r\n\r\n6,385;  Bukit Merah 9,039; Queenstown,  5,993;  and\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru  8,094.  In all these  constituencies,\r\n\r\nSir,  Bukit Ho Swee has two secondary schools  with\r\n\r\n60 classrooms; Delta, two secondary schools with 46\r\n\r\nclassrooms; Bukit Merah, one secondary school  with\r\n\r\n25  classrooms; Queenstown, three secondary schools\r\n\r\nwith 100 classrooms. In Tiong Bahru, there is none.\r\n\r\nSir,  by  giving  all these statistics,  I  am  not\r\n\r\ncomplaining  that there are more secondary  schools\r\n\r\nin  other constituencies. But the Minister of State\r\n\r\nconcerned has answered me earlier that schools  are\r\n\r\nbuilt  according  to the needs of  the  area  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole. That being so, according to the 1970 census,\r\n\r\nthere are altogether 36,874 children in the correct\r\n\r\nage group for admission to secondary schools in the\r\n\r\nfive constituencies. And there is a total number of\r\n\r\neight  secondary  schools, housing  231  classrooms\r\n\r\nwith  accommodation for 18,480 students.  It  would\r\n\r\nappear,  therefore, that there is an acute shortage\r\n\r\nof secondary schools for these five constituencies,\r\n\r\nit means that there is only one place for every two\r\n\r\nstudents in these five areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister concerned will look into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> I am not moving, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, I value the Member for\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru's appreciation of the difficulties  we\r\n\r\nare  facing.

According to the Development Plan,\r\n\r\nJurong  Town  will  soon  have  a  population   of\r\n\r\n100,000.  The Jurong Secondary School also  caters\r\n\r\nfor  children  living in Chua  Chu  Kang  and  The\r\n\r\nsurrounding  areas.  According to  investigations,\r\n\r\nthere are altogether 47 Primary VI classes in this\r\n\r\narea  with  a  student  population  of  9,000.  In\r\n\r\naddition to the Jurong Secondary School, there  is\r\n\r\nthe  Jalan  Lama Secondary School. However,  these\r\n\r\ntwo  secondary  schools  are  not  big  enough  to\r\n\r\naccommodate all the students who would be  leaving\r\n\r\nprimary  school.

For instance,  certain\r\n\r\nschools  have  applied  for assistance  to  repair\r\n\r\nschool  equipment and furniture, such  as  chairs,\r\n\r\nbut  their  applications have usually been  turned\r\n\r\ndown because of the tedious procedure involved.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister of State will look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter  to see whether there is any truth in  such\r\n\r\nallegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $1 million for the next\r\n\r\nfinancial  year is quite a large sum of  money.  I\r\n\r\nwish to know whether any applications have already\r\n\r\nbeen made in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

I cannot understand why the Umar  Pulavar\r\n\r\nTamil  School at Maxwell Road has no  field  or  a\r\n\r\nplayground.

As\r\n\r\nregards the particular point he has raised, if my\r\n\r\nmemory  serves me right, the Ministry has not  yet\r\n\r\nreceived any proposals, and therefore I am not  in\r\n\r\na position to answer him one way or another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong, I am sure he realises that there  are\r\n\r\nsufficient  places for primary school entrants  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  except perhaps in those schools  which\r\n\r\nare  located  out  of the way. There  are  primary\r\n\r\nschools  in certain areas which are not, in  fact,\r\n\r\nfully occupied. Therefore, we cannot consider  any\r\n\r\nrequest  too generously. However, if  he  has  any\r\n\r\ncase    which    he   thinks   deserves    special\r\n\r\nconsideration, will he please let us know. I think\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang has also asked for  the\r\n\r\nnames  of  schools which have applied for  capital\r\n\r\ngrants. I am afraid I do not have the details with\r\n\r\nme  now.

(2)  What  are  the\r\n\r\ncourses  offered by this Centre, and  is  there  a\r\n\r\ncourse for the training of cooks? At present  with\r\n\r\nso many hotels and restaurants being set up, there\r\n\r\nis  an  acute shortage of cooks. Many of the cooks\r\n\r\nworking  in our restaurants at present  have  come\r\n\r\nfrom abroad, and we have to spend a lot of foreign\r\n\r\nexchange on them. If we can train our local people\r\n\r\nto  be  cooks, we can reduce the foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nspent on importing foreign cooks. (3) What are the\r\n\r\nqualifications  required  for  admission  to  this\r\n\r\nCentre?  (4)  What  are the fees  charged  by  the\r\n\r\nCentre  for each student?

Among the courses run by the  Centre,\r\n\r\nthere is a course for the training of cooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the qualifications required for the\r\n\r\nadmission  of students, this is largely  dependent\r\n\r\non the type of training course that the student is\r\n\r\napplying  for. There are various kinds of  courses\r\n\r\navailable, each requiring a different standard  of\r\n\r\nqualification. As regards school fees, the  amount\r\n\r\nis dependent on the duration of the course and the\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels of training to be provided.

(2)\r\n\r\nIs there any plan for the setting up of colour T.\r\n\r\nV, in Singapore?

As  an  advanced country in this region,  we\r\n\r\nshould   now  give  early  consideration  to   the\r\n\r\nprovision  of colour T.V, so that our  people  can\r\n\r\nenjoy their programmes better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, has the\r\n\r\nMinister  any plans to start a third T.V, channel,\r\n\r\nespecially for Tamil and Malay programmes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, we have two outside broadcast  vans,\r\n\r\nand they are used to cover events occurring in the\r\n\r\nvarious  parts of Singapore, such as National  Day\r\n\r\nparades,   sports  activities  and,  occasionally,\r\n\r\nvariety  shows at the National Theatre.  The  vans\r\n\r\nwere purchased in 1962 at a cost of $794,000. They\r\n\r\nare  useful for covering events live. But  because\r\n\r\nof  the lack of crew, we have not been able to use\r\n\r\nthe vans as much as we want to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second query is about colour T.V. This is a\r\n\r\nvery complicated matter. Of course, colour T.V, is\r\n\r\nthe  logical follow-up of the black and white T.V.\r\n\r\nthat  we  now  have. The problem is:  do  we  have\r\n\r\nenough   technicians  to   run   a   station   for\r\n\r\ntelecasting colour programmes? As it  is  now,  we\r\n\r\nare  actually short of technicians. Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nis  not  possible at this stage to  say  with  any\r\n\r\ncertainty  when we can introduce colour T.V.,  but\r\n\r\nwe  are  certainly travelling on that course.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  is much more complicated than  it  seems.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there are at present three different\r\n\r\nsystems  used by countries all over the world  for\r\n\r\ncolour   TV.   Firstly,  there  is  the   N.T.S.C.\r\n\r\n-National Television System Committee -  which  is\r\n\r\nused   by   the  United  States,  Canada,  Mexico,\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  Japan and Taiwan. The second  system\r\n\r\nis  S.E.C.A.M. - do not ask me what it is, because\r\n\r\nI  am  as ignorant as some Members are. All I know\r\n\r\nis  that it is called S.E.C.A.M, and it is used by\r\n\r\nFrance,  the U.S.S.R, and certain Eastern European\r\n\r\ncountries. The third system is P.A.L. It  is  used\r\n\r\nby  most Western European countries, including the\r\n\r\nUnited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKingdom,  and it is going to be used by  Australia\r\n\r\nand  New Zealand. The important consideration here\r\n\r\nis to choose a system that is used by the majority\r\n\r\nof  the  countries in the world.  If  we  were  to\r\n\r\nchoose the wrong system, then we may come up  with\r\n\r\nmany difficulties in the future, such as programme\r\n\r\nexchanges,  spare  parts,  and  others.  For   the\r\n\r\nmoment,  it  appears  that the  P.A.L, system  is\r\n\r\ngaining  the upper hand. So much about the systems\r\n\r\nthat we have to choose from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that if we want to run our\r\n\r\ncolour  T.V, as successfully as we want it to  be,\r\n\r\nthen  it  is only logical that as many viewers  as\r\n\r\npossible  do enjoy our colour T.V, programmes.  At\r\n\r\nthe  present  moment,  I am  afraid  this  is  not\r\n\r\npossible because of the high cost of a colour T.V.\r\n\r\nset. I understand that an ordinary colour T.V, set\r\n\r\ncosts  between $1,000 and $2,000 each. Even though\r\n\r\nwe  are getting this 13th salary payment, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  colour  T.V, is within the  reach  of  many\r\n\r\npeople in Singapore. I hope that the day will come\r\n\r\nwhen  these  colour T.V, sets can be  produced  in\r\n\r\nsuch large numbers that their price can be brought\r\n\r\ndown  to a level where many people can enjoy  this\r\n\r\nservice. It is no use spending millions of dollars\r\n\r\nto  provide  a service which can only satisfy  the\r\n\r\nluxurious needs of a small section of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of the problem is that it takes\r\n\r\na  long  time to put this service into  operation.\r\n\r\nTake,  for example, Australia. Since 1967  it  has\r\n\r\ncommitted itself to colour T.V, but up to  now  it\r\n\r\nhas  still not telecast any colour T.V, programmes\r\n\r\nyet.  From this example, we can see that  we  have\r\n\r\nbarely  the  knowledge of how to initiate  such  a\r\n\r\nscheme.  All  I  can say is that  at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment  we are travelling on that course. We  have\r\n\r\nsent  two  engineers to Germany for training,  and\r\n\r\nanother  two will be sent in the near  future  to,\r\n\r\npossibly, the British Broadcasting Corporation  in\r\n\r\nEngland. When they return, we hope to be  able  to\r\n\r\nbuild up a nucleus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  engineers to start this service. But I am  not\r\n\r\nable  to  say when it will be because of the  many\r\n\r\nproblems which I have outlined just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a third T.V, channel, I do not think\r\n\r\nit  is possible to provide because we do not  have\r\n\r\nenough  channels on our T.V, sets. If we  want  to\r\n\r\nhave a third channel for Singapore - the other two\r\n\r\nare occupied by the Malaysian network - we have to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a different system, which  again  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  costly matter. Therefore, I do not think  it\r\n\r\nis  possible to introduce a third channel  at  the\r\n\r\npresent moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nthe Minister for his very detailed explanation  of\r\n\r\nthe  problems.

The Centre is known as the  Centre\r\n\r\nfor  Production  and Training of  Adult  Education\r\n\r\nTelevision (CEPTA T.V.). CEPTA T.V, will be  sited\r\n\r\nat  the  R.T.S, complex; iii fact, it  is  just  a\r\n\r\nstone's  throw from the present T.V, complex.

I reserve further comments for  the\r\n\r\nMinister's reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, if the Member for Katong\r\n\r\nthinks  that  the  library will be  sited  in  his\r\n\r\nconstituency, I am afraid he will be disappointed.\r\n\r\nIt will not be sited in his constituency, but in a\r\n\r\ndistrict  which  we  have  always  called  vaguely\r\n\r\n\"Katong District\". Therefore, the name \"Katong\" is\r\n\r\nquite  relevant to the site for the library  which\r\n\r\nwe are going to provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site will be in the Katong Estate, Phase II\r\n\r\nDevelopment, on reclaimed land between  Joo  Chiat\r\n\r\nRoad  and  Still Road. The library  will  serve  a\r\n\r\ndensely populated area. It will be about two miles\r\n\r\naway  from  the Tanjong Rhu Housing Estate,  which\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Katong has so fondly referred  to.\r\n\r\nTherefore, his constituents will have easy  access\r\n\r\nto this new library. I was told that a new housing\r\n\r\nestate will he built in this area, and, therefore,\r\n\r\na  library there will serve much more people  than\r\n\r\nif   it   were   sited  merely   in   the   Katong\r\n\r\nconstituency. I think we should look  at  it  this\r\n\r\nway:   a   library  should  serve  not  just   one\r\n\r\nconstituency.   If   we  are   to   provide   each\r\n\r\nconstituency with a library, we will  run  out  of\r\n\r\nfunds in no time. The problem is how to distribute\r\n\r\nthe   services  of  a  library  so  that   several\r\n\r\nconstituencies  can  share one  library.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect I think the proposed site should serve the\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with respect to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's  view that we should  not  site  a\r\n\r\nlibrary  in  each constituency, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that, apart from the establishment  of\r\n\r\nthis  new  library  in the new  development  area,\r\n\r\nthere is also, already, a library in the Too Chiat\r\n\r\nconstituency serving the people in that area.

In view of what I have said,\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  Minister will consider extending  at\r\n\r\nleast  some sort of service to the people  in  the\r\n\r\nTanjong  Rhu Housing Estate. If the Minister  does\r\n\r\nnot wish to answer, but wishes to consider -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I see that he wishes to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  considering where to site a library,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we should not be parochial in our approach.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, Katong constituency is now served by two\r\n\r\nlibraries,  one  in Too Chiat and one  in  Siglap.\r\n\r\nThough  they  are both quite small libraries  they\r\n\r\nserve  the  purpose for the time being. By  siting\r\n\r\nthis new library in the reclaimed land, we hope to\r\n\r\nserve  a  much bigger population than just  Katong\r\n\r\nconstituency because, unlike what the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong has described just now that the place  will\r\n\r\nbe  full of large bungalows and so on, it  is  not\r\n\r\nquite true, and I understand that the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board has plans to build  fairly  big\r\n\r\nflats in the housing estate there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Four and five-room flats!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes.

Further, by siting this  library  away\r\n\r\nfrom   the   Katong  constituency,  we  have   the\r\n\r\nadvantage of not only serving Katong but also  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  like Changi, Siglap,  Tam-pines  and\r\n\r\nmany others. This will, in fact, benefit much more\r\n\r\npeople, including the poorer people living in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas, than just those living in Tanjong Rhu\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all I am saying\r\n\r\nis that, since both Siglap and Joo Chiat have each\r\n\r\na  library, can the provisions of this new central\r\n\r\nlibrary  be  extended by way of  a  better  mobile\r\n\r\nservice  to the Tanjong Rhu area, which is  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency? Never mind if Katong cannot get  the\r\n\r\nsame provision a the other constituencies, but  at\r\n\r\nleast  he  can afford the provision  of  a  mobile\r\n\r\nlibrary service.

I would  like  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to praise the People's Association for\r\n\r\npromoting  the  various  activities  in  community\r\n\r\ncentres. I would also like to thank the management\r\n\r\ncommittees  of the community centres for  devoting\r\n\r\ntheir  time  and effort in promoting  many  useful\r\n\r\nkinds of activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in all we have about 190\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres, including those in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas. However, the provision of $150,000 for this\r\n\r\nfinancial year is inadequate to meet the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  rural community. Therefore, I would like  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to ask for more money from the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance.  Although there are  nine  community\r\n\r\ncentres in my constituency, I still think they are\r\n\r\nnot  enough because the rural community is  spread\r\n\r\nover  a  very wide area. But in town, the area  is\r\n\r\nvery  small and one or two community centres  will\r\n\r\nserve  the  purpose.  For example,  there  are  15\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres in Chua Chu Kang  constituency,\r\n\r\nwhich is six more than my constituency. There  are\r\n\r\nalso  15  community centres in Jurong. However,  I\r\n\r\nstill think there should be more community centres\r\n\r\nfor  Chua  Chu  Kang  and  Jurong  constituencies,\r\n\r\nbecause  more and more people are shifting  in  to\r\n\r\nthese rural areas. Therefore, we should build more\r\n\r\ncommunity centres for the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he has\r\n\r\nany  plans to build a rural-type community  centre\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  out of this vote.  There  are  two\r\n\r\nvillages  in my constituency with a population  of\r\n\r\nabout  500  families.  They  have  asked  for  the\r\n\r\nprovision of a community centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember  is  rather  covetous, not  only  in  other\r\n\r\nrespects but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  in respect of community centres. If that  is\r\n\r\nwhat  he wants, the answer is no. In fact, we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to cut down the number of community centres\r\n\r\nin his constituency, because we feel that they are\r\n\r\nnot  being properly used. The problem is  not  how\r\n\r\nmany community centres we should have, but how are\r\n\r\nwe going to use them to the best advantage so that\r\n\r\nthey  can  provide beneficial and useful amenities\r\n\r\nto  the people. If you have a very good and active\r\n\r\ncommunity centre, it is as good as having 10.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, there is only one community centre in my\r\n\r\nconstituency. I think the Member for  Tanglin  has\r\n\r\nnot  even got a standard-size community centre  in\r\n\r\nhis  constituency. In the case of Sembawang, there\r\n\r\nare  already three standard-size community centres\r\n\r\nand  six rural-type community centres. And we feel\r\n\r\nthat many of them have not been properly made  use\r\n\r\nof or under-used.

The\r\n\r\nprovision  of $45,000 shown under this subhead  in\r\n\r\nthe  Development  Estimates  for  1972-73  is  the\r\n\r\namount   necessary   to  meet   the   balance   of\r\n\r\nexpenditure for the project which has a total cost\r\n\r\nof  about  $180,000.  To-date the  expenditure  is\r\n\r\n$142,554.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the female prison, the emphasis, of course, is\r\n\r\non   rehabilitation.  There  is  a  rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprogramme aimed at assisting the inmates to return\r\n\r\nto  the  community  as  law-abiding  and  socially\r\n\r\nuseful   persons.  This  programme  includes   the\r\n\r\nfollowing:    training   in    self-control    and\r\n\r\ndiscipline;  vocational training and  work;  moral\r\n\r\ntraining    and   the   cultivation   of    social\r\n\r\nconsciousness;  group work and female  counselling\r\n\r\nwork.  They are also given opportunities to  learn\r\n\r\nskills,  to  improve  their  work  habit  and   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in work for which they are paid a fair\r\n\r\nwage, ranging from $1 to $10 per week according to\r\n\r\ntheir  skills  and  industry. For  those  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved   in  productive  work,  like  tailoring,\r\n\r\nlaundering or the manufacturing of stuffed  dolls,\r\n\r\nan  industrial bonus at piece-rate is payable,  in\r\n\r\naddition  to the normal prison earnings. They  are\r\n\r\nnot  eligible for any prison earning for the first\r\n\r\nmonth.   However,  thereafter  they   are   graded\r\n\r\naccording  to their performance and  are  paid  as\r\n\r\nfollows:  (a)  eight cents per day  and  15  cents\r\n\r\nbonus  for  each completed week; (b) 10 cents  per\r\n\r\nday  and  20 cents bonus for each completed  week;\r\n\r\n(c)  15 cents per day and 30 cents bonus for  each\r\n\r\ncompleted week; (d) 20 cents per day and 40  cents\r\n\r\nbonus  for each completed week; and (e)  25  cents\r\n\r\nper  day  and  60  cents bonus for each  completed\r\n\r\nweek.  On an average, Sir, a female prisoner  gets\r\n\r\napproximately  $5  a  week  as  industrial  bonus.\r\n\r\nHigher earners can get as much as $10 per week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a showroom at Changi Prison where the\r\n\r\narticles made by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprisoners are on show.

Sir, in last year's Budget\r\n\r\nEstimates,  there was a provision of $242,100  for\r\n\r\nthe  building of a fire station in Jurong.  Jurong\r\n\r\nurgently  needs a fire station. I spoke at  length\r\n\r\non  this  matter  last year, and in  reply  to  my\r\n\r\nquestion  the  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Social Affairs said that  this  fire\r\n\r\nstation  would be built sometime in 1971 or  1972.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  can  refer to Hansard,  dated  25th\r\n\r\nMarch,  1971,  at col. 1337.

The Jurong Fire Station project\r\n\r\nis   now  being  evaluated  by  officials  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance. When the project papers  are\r\n\r\nfinalised,  they  will be put to  the  Development\r\n\r\nPlanning Committee for consideration. It  is  not,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  possible for me to inform  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong  as to when the fire station  will  be\r\n\r\nbuilt,  because formal approval has not  yet  been\r\n\r\ngranted by the Development Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the reason for the delay, this can only be\r\n\r\nattributed to the need for costing. This was  only\r\n\r\ncompleted in January 1972. We were advised by  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Architect  of the Public Works  Department\r\n\r\nthat  the cost of building the fire station  would\r\n\r\namount to $750,000 approximately. The Member  will\r\n\r\nappreciate  that  development  projects  from  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries are submitted to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance and the Economic Development  Division\r\n\r\nwho will then process these projects in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  their  priorities. The Jurong  Fire  Station\r\n\r\nproject  is now receiving the urgent attention  of\r\n\r\nthe officials of that Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to build a fire station was first\r\n\r\nmooted  in  June 1966 for inclusion  in  the  1967\r\n\r\nDevelopment    Estimates.   This   proposal    was\r\n\r\nconsidered   and   approved  by  the   Development\r\n\r\nPlanning Sub-Committee which had recommended a sum\r\n\r\nof  money  towards the project. The  approval  was\r\n\r\nconveyed  to us on 21st August, 1968. However,  on\r\n\r\n14th  November, 1968, my Ministry was advised that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance  had  decided  not  to\r\n\r\nproceed with the Jurong Fire Station project  and,\r\n\r\nas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  result,  the Fire Brigade head of  expenditure\r\n\r\nwas  deleted from the 1969 Development Estimates.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Finance was then  of  the  view\r\n\r\nthat   the   Jurong  industrial  town  would   be\r\n\r\nadequately  served  by the  Alexandra  and  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah Fire Stations. My Ministry subsequently re-submitted the proposal for a Jurong Fire Station,\r\n\r\nand  it  was  included in the 1971-72 Development\r\n\r\nEstimates.

Their operations\r\n\r\nhave contributed quite a great deal to the problems\r\n\r\nof  noise, air and water pollution.

I would like to request the Minister to bear\r\n\r\nin   mind  the  following  factors.  Most  of   the\r\n\r\nresidents living in Bedok, Padang Terbakar, Kampong\r\n\r\nAyer  Gemuroh  and Tanah Merah Besar are  fishermen\r\n\r\nand  farmers. Consideration should be given to  see\r\n\r\nthat  no  hardship or inconvenience  is  caused  to\r\n\r\nthese  farmers, fishermen, or the residents due  to\r\n\r\nreclamation  works. If any land is to be  acquired,\r\n\r\nthe affected families should be fairly compensated.\r\n\r\nOf  course, the purpose of reclamation work  is  to\r\n\r\nadd  some more land to our Republic, but if  it  is\r\n\r\ncarried  out without sufficient foresight  and  due\r\n\r\nattention  to the existing conditions of the  area,\r\n\r\nthis may cause untold hardship to the residents  in\r\n\r\nthat area. There are many small canals in this area\r\n\r\nearmarked for the reclamation project. These canals\r\n\r\nserve as outlets to the sea for the fishermen. When\r\n\r\nthese canals are filled up, the fishermen will  not\r\n\r\nbe  able  to push their sampans out to the sea  nor\r\n\r\nwill  they be able to berth their fishing boats  or\r\n\r\nsampans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it is, the area between Bedok and Telok\r\n\r\nMata  Ikan is low-lying and often gets flooded when\r\n\r\nheavy  rain  falls or when the tide  is  high.  The\r\n\r\nfilling  up  of  these canals will,  therefore,  be\r\n\r\nanother  cause for floods in this area. I am  told,\r\n\r\nSir, that floods bring untold damage and misery  to\r\n\r\nthe  residents in the affected area as a whole.  It\r\n\r\nis   hoped   that  the  Minister  will  give   full\r\n\r\nconsideration to these problems before  the  actual\r\n\r\nreclamation work commences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, Phase IV of the reclamation\r\n\r\nscheme  from Bedok to Tanah Merah will  cause  some\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the people living along that  part\r\n\r\nof  the  coast. With reclamation, inconvenience  is\r\n\r\nunavoidable. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  effort  will  be made  by  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to minimise the inconvenience and\r\n\r\nto  prevent any hardships to those affected. In its\r\n\r\nexperience in reclaiming land from Bedok to Tanjong\r\n\r\nRhu,  the  Board has learned from its few mistakes,\r\n\r\nand  I  am sure they will be more careful with  the\r\n\r\nsecond stretch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will be pleased to learn that there is\r\n\r\nno  proposal  to acquire the land along  the  coast\r\n\r\nabove  the  high-water mark. This reclamation  will\r\n\r\nonly be confined to the coastal foreshore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the danger of flooding, the major canals\r\n\r\nserving the area, namely, Bedok canal, Sungei  Mata\r\n\r\nIkan  and  Sungei  Ayer Gemuroh, will  be  extended\r\n\r\nacross the reclaimed land into the sea so that  the\r\n\r\nexisting  stretch in the area will not be affected.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of reclamation, the Board  will\r\n\r\nalso  construct more drains to facilitate the  flow\r\n\r\nof rain-water from the foreshore to the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fishermen living along the coast, they\r\n\r\nwill  be able to retain the use of these canals  as\r\n\r\nan  access for their boats. From our experience  in\r\n\r\nreclaiming  the  coast along the Siglap  area,  the\r\n\r\nfishermen are, in fact, now using the new foreshore\r\n\r\nfor pitching their boats. All they have to do is to\r\n\r\nwalk  the additional distance of the reclaimed land\r\n\r\nin  order to get to the sea. This takes about  five\r\n\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Member himself to let my\r\n\r\nMinistry  know  if  there  is  any  part   of   the\r\n\r\nreclamation  work which leads to the  inconvenience\r\n\r\nof  the  residents  there  or  if  any  canals  are\r\n\r\nblocked, thus causing floods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In view of the assurance given\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister that the Board will minimise  any\r\n\r\ninconvenience or hardship, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nNg Kah Ting -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 72 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 501.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not moving, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $43,569,610 for Head 72 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 73 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nbeg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 73 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 104.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few days ago we have been debating on the\r\n\r\nfact  that the prices of agricultural produce have\r\n\r\ndropped  to  a very low level recently.  Even  the\r\n\r\nprice of pigs has been going down sharply, causing\r\n\r\nheavy  losses  to  the  farmers.  According  to  a\r\n\r\ngeneral investigation, one of the reasons is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Abattoir  in Jurong  has  adopted  a\r\n\r\nworking system of one rest day every week. Because\r\n\r\nof  this,  the usual number of pigs sent  on  that\r\n\r\nparticular  day was not slaughtered. According  to\r\n\r\ncalculations that number will total  up  to  5,000\r\n\r\npigs  per month owing to rest days. I believe  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is as concerned as Members on this  side\r\n\r\nabout  the interest and welfare of the farmers.  I\r\n\r\nappeal to him to reconsider the matter of allowing\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Abattoir to close for one  rest  day\r\n\r\nevery  week.  This should stop, and  the  Abattoir\r\n\r\nshould be opened throughout the whole week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I rise to support the motion moved by the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong. The request he has made is also\r\n\r\nthe request and the fervent hope of the people  in\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu. To my mind, the 7-day working  system\r\n\r\nas adopted by the Central Abattoir until now was a\r\n\r\nvery   practical   one,   even   in   respect   of\r\n\r\nadministration. The question of a rest day can  be\r\n\r\neasily solved in other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem also relates to the question of\r\n\r\nrural abattoirs. I remember two years ago in this\r\n\r\nHouse I made a request for the setting up of rural\r\n\r\nabattoirs in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years have elapsed, and I still cannot find\r\n\r\nits inclusion in the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the weekly rest day on Mondays\r\n\r\nfor  butchers  slaughtering pigs  at  the  Central\r\n\r\nAbattoir  in  Jurong and the French Road  Abattoir\r\n\r\nwas  introduced  last  year after  representations\r\n\r\nwere  made to the Government by the Singapore Pork\r\n\r\nMerchants  Association. But if all concerned  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  rest day is not necessary, the existing\r\n\r\narrangements can be reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the price of pigs, I believe it is\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by more important market factors  than\r\n\r\njust  having another working day for the butchers.\r\n\r\nAs an indication of this, the total number of pigs\r\n\r\nslaughtered  in both abattoirs has maintained  its\r\n\r\nsteady normal increase since the implementation of\r\n\r\nthe  rest day. My Ministry itself would prefer  to\r\n\r\nhave  a 7-day week, but we cannot force people  to\r\n\r\nwork  for seven days. A 7-day week means  you  get\r\n\r\ngood fresh pork for seven days of the week. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  question  of the farmers  as  against  the\r\n\r\nbutchers. But somehow the question of farmers  and\r\n\r\nbutchers went on to the abattoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for rural abattoirs, recent studies have shown\r\n\r\nthat   there  is  no  immediate  need  for   rural\r\n\r\nabattoirs.

Hence,  the\r\n\r\ndiminishing financial provision for it.  But  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Members  need  not be  concerned.  When  the\r\n\r\nproject was first approved, there was a provision\r\n\r\nof  about  $220,000 for capital expenditure.  The\r\n\r\nbulk  of  this  provision has been  utilised  for\r\n\r\nland,  buildings,  furniture and  equipment.  The\r\n\r\nbalance  which  has been revoted this  year,  and\r\n\r\nabout  which  the Member for Sembawang  enquires,\r\n\r\nwill be used for the purpose of a few more pieces\r\n\r\nof equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researches, which have been initiated, have been\r\n\r\nmade towards improving the yield of our crops  by\r\n\r\nthe  selection  of  good parent  plants,  through\r\n\r\nbetter  fertilising practices, and through better\r\n\r\ncontrol   of   pests  and  diseases.   In   fact,\r\n\r\nexperiments  have  been  carried   out   at   the\r\n\r\nSembawang  Field  Station and  the  demonstration\r\n\r\nfarm  at  Lim  Chu  Kang.

Subsequently,     after\r\n\r\nconsultations and discussions between the parties\r\n\r\nconcerned,  some  agreement was reached  and  the\r\n\r\nfish merchants agreed to move over to the Central\r\n\r\nFish  Market.  According  to  officials  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Fish Merchants Federation, one  of  the\r\n\r\nterms of agreement was that the temporary offices\r\n\r\nin  the  fish  market would be  rebuilt  after  a\r\n\r\nperiod of two years. Sir, these temporary offices\r\n\r\nare  made  of  planks  and each  office  measures\r\n\r\nroughly  15  feet x 10 feet x 10 feet.  They  are\r\n\r\nvery  small and the height is low, and under  the\r\n\r\nscorching sun they are as hot as oven. Apart from\r\n\r\nspace  for desks and cupboards, there is no  room\r\n\r\nleft to put even a canvas bed for the workers  to\r\n\r\nrest.  I understand that some of the plank  walls\r\n\r\nof  these  offices have already been attacked  by\r\n\r\ntermites.  Sir,  the question of  rebuilding  the\r\n\r\ntemporary  offices has always been troubling  the\r\n\r\nfish  merchants  there. They have  referred  this\r\n\r\nmatter   to  the  Primary  Production  Department\r\n\r\nseveral   times   but  have  not   received   any\r\n\r\nsatisfactory answer. I understand, Sir, that  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department is now thinking  of\r\n\r\nextending  the  auction  market  itself.  Between\r\n\r\nextending  the auction market and rebuilding  the\r\n\r\ntemporary  offices, I think the  latter  is  more\r\n\r\nurgent.   The  Minister  concerned  should   give\r\n\r\npriority to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next matter I wish to deal with is the\r\n\r\nmanagement and administration of the market. I have\r\n\r\nreceived several complaints that the management and\r\n\r\nadministration of the market is very poor.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\ntook  up the matter of security of the market  with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Home Affairs yesterday  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  This  is related to the management  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  I  feel  that  the  passes  required   for\r\n\r\nentering the market should not be issued at random.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  there should be stricter check-points\r\n\r\nat the entrance to ensure that bad elements are not\r\n\r\nallowed in. I also understand that there is no full-time  staff  to  take charge of administrative  and\r\n\r\nmanagement matters in the fish market. The  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department sends a man there  about  two\r\n\r\nor  three times a week to look things over, and  on\r\n\r\neach occasion the officer will stay there for about\r\n\r\none or two hours. After that, he will have to go to\r\n\r\nChangi  to attend to other matters. I cannot  blame\r\n\r\nhim  for  that.  But whenever this officer  is  not\r\n\r\npresent at the market, the fish merchants will have\r\n\r\nnobody  to  turn  to  for  help.  So  under   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances  it  is  difficult  to   expect   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of the fish market to be  efficient.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister will ensure  that  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department will send a full-time man  to\r\n\r\ntake charge of the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there are altogether six\r\n\r\nsupervisory  officers and 12 subordinate  staff  on\r\n\r\nduty  at  the  fish auction market.  Each  morning,\r\n\r\nduring  the auctioning period, their duties are  to\r\n\r\nsee   that  the  fish  merchants,  auctioneers  and\r\n\r\nretailers,  conduct their business  in  an  orderly\r\n\r\nmanner  and  that  the facilities  of  the  auction\r\n\r\nmarket  are  properly made use of.  These  officers\r\n\r\nalso   patrol  the  market  and  its  surroundings.\r\n\r\nSupervision-wise, there have, in fact, been  a  few\r\n\r\ninstances  where the fish merchants have complained\r\n\r\nto the Department that these officers have been too\r\n\r\nstrict  in the enforcement of rules and regulations\r\n\r\nat the auction market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the gates to the fishing port are manned by\r\n\r\ntwo  security  guards per shift. These  guards  are\r\n\r\nretired police officers, whose duties are to  check\r\n\r\non persons entering the fishing port area. However,\r\n\r\nas the number of people entering the gates is about\r\n\r\n3,000  per  night  in  about 500  vehicles,  it  is\r\n\r\npractically   impossible  to  check  every   person\r\n\r\nentering  the  market as this would  cause  a  long\r\n\r\nqueue and much inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the site of the buildings, may I say at\r\n\r\nthe  outset that when this idea of transferring the\r\n\r\nfishermen or the fish merchants from Ellen  borough\r\n\r\nMarket and Clyde Terrace Market to Jurong was first\r\n\r\nthought of, there was, as the Member for Jurong has\r\n\r\npointed  Out, considerable opposition.  There  were\r\n\r\nprotests   to  the  M.P.s  concerned.  There   were\r\n\r\nprotests  also  to  more senior and  more  powerful\r\n\r\nMinisters.  But finally we managed to get  them  to\r\n\r\nshift. Within two months, they threw a tea party to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  was  invited, which means  that  we  were\r\n\r\ncorrect in getting them there. But to recapitulate,\r\n\r\nas   for  the  buildings,  the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  has erected three blocks  of  temporary\r\n\r\ntimber offices for the use of these fish merchants.\r\n\r\nThe  Department  did  not undertake  to  construct\r\n\r\npermanent offices for the fish merchants. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  Department  is of the view  that  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  should  erect their own  facilities.  So  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  commercial  companies  engaged  in  the\r\n\r\ncatching  and  auctioning of fish have  constructed\r\n\r\ntheir  own  offices  as  well  as  fish  processing\r\n\r\ninstallations. The Department itself is prepared to\r\n\r\nrecommend  to  the  Jurong Town Corporation,  which\r\n\r\nowns the land at the fishing port, to lease land to\r\n\r\nfish  merchants  who  wish to construct  their  own\r\n\r\npermanent offices, or to lease a piece of  land  to\r\n\r\nthe   Fish  Merchants  Association  for   them   to\r\n\r\nconstruct offices for their members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nunderstand that not all the fish merchants are rich\r\n\r\npeople.

For example, with the\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of fishing boats, there was\r\n\r\nlack of proper facilities for unloading catches of\r\n\r\nfish,   and  owing  to  the  narrowness  of   that\r\n\r\nparticular  end of the Serangoon River  there  was\r\n\r\ncongestion  and  overcrowding of boats  trying  to\r\n\r\nfind anchorage facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing jetty at Kangkar is far too small\r\n\r\nand   narrow.

I would like to know whether\r\n\r\nthe  Primary Production Department has  any  other\r\n\r\nplans  to  develop this fishing base, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthis year's provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the last Budget\r\n\r\nsession  the  Member for Punggol inquired  whether\r\n\r\nthere  were  plans  to develop  the  Kangkar  fish\r\n\r\nmarket and what action was being taken.

I wish to find out  from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether there are plans to  build  a\r\n\r\npedestrian overhead bridge or an underpass  across\r\n\r\nMountbatten   Road  at  a  point  somewhere   near\r\n\r\nGuillemard Road. 1 consider it necessary.  Let  me\r\n\r\ngive the reasons. When games are held in future at\r\n\r\nthe Sports Complex in Kallang Park, there will be,\r\n\r\nas  can be expected, a heavy volume of traffic  as\r\n\r\nwell  as a big crowd of pedestrians going  to  and\r\n\r\nreturning  from  the  games.  A  specially  strong\r\n\r\npedestrian  overhead bridge, or preferably  a  big\r\n\r\nunderpass,  would  draw the crowd  of  pedestrians\r\n\r\naway  from the road, leaving it entirely free  for\r\n\r\nthe  use  of vehicles. Otherwise pedestrians  will\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult  to  cross  Mount-batten  Road\r\n\r\nbefore and after the games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bulk of the population of my\r\n\r\nconstituency  live  in  the  Old  Kallang  Airport\r\n\r\nEstate,  which  is  directly opposite  the  Sports\r\n\r\nComplex  and  separated by  Mountbatten  Road.  An\r\n\r\noverhead  bridge  or underpass across  Mountbatten\r\n\r\nRoad   will   be  convenient  for   some   of   my\r\n\r\nconstituents, who are sports enthusiasts, to  walk\r\n\r\nacross  to  the  Sports Complex instead  of  going\r\n\r\nthere  by car or bus, which may add to the traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion  that is expected there. In fact,  most\r\n\r\nof  the people who do not own cars will benefit if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  pedestrian  overhead  bridge  or  an\r\n\r\nunderpass  for them to go across Mountbatten  Road\r\n\r\nto the Sports Complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to hear the Minister's views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity to bring to the Minister's\r\n\r\nnotice a certain oversight in the building  of  an\r\n\r\noverhead  bridge in my constituency,  which  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  is not characteristic other overhead bridges\r\n\r\n-  I  hope  not anyway. The overhead bridge  I  am\r\n\r\ntalking   about   is  the  one   standing   across\r\n\r\nMountbatten  Road from the vicinity of  the  Jalan\r\n\r\nBatu  housing complex on one side to the  vicinity\r\n\r\nof  Tun Sen Lanang School on the other. The  steps\r\n\r\nleading  up to the bridge on the Jalan  Batu  side\r\n\r\nare  very well constructed, and there seems to  he\r\n\r\nlogic in the construction of two stairways down to\r\n\r\nthe  pavement. But on the other side of the bridge\r\n\r\nat  Tun  Sen  Lanang  School, there  is  only  one\r\n\r\nstairway  down leading to within one  and  a  half\r\n\r\nfeet  of  the  road. One would  imagine  that  the\r\n\r\nstairway of an overhead bridge should open out  on\r\n\r\nto  the  pavement  away from  the  road,  and  not\r\n\r\nimmediately on to the road. The whole  purpose  of\r\n\r\nthe  pedestrian bridge is to get pedestrians  away\r\n\r\nfrom the road. But this bridge seems to be leading\r\n\r\npedestrians back on to the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had occasion to talk this matter over with one\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister's officials, and as a  result  a\r\n\r\nrailing has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaced to protect the pedestrians, should  a  bus\r\n\r\nor   a  vehicle  come  too  close  to  where  the\r\n\r\npedestrian  bridge ends up on  the  road.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould imagine that if such a thing should happen,\r\n\r\nthis   railing  will  not  be  very  much  of   a\r\n\r\nprotection  to  pedestrians.  I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to ask his officials to consider working\r\n\r\nout  a  safer way for my constituents to go  from\r\n\r\none side of Mount-batten Road to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, action has already\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  in  the  light  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong's representation to widen the footpath  in\r\n\r\nfront  of  the  steps of the overhead  bridge  in\r\n\r\nquestion, and to make a slight realignment of the\r\n\r\nroadside kerbs. As the Member has pointed out,  a\r\n\r\n30-foot long railing has also been erected  as  a\r\n\r\nfurther  safeguard. If the Member  is  still  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied,  we will proceed further to  meet  his\r\n\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Mountbatten,\r\n\r\ninvestigations carried out have shown  that  very\r\n\r\nfew  pedestrians cross that portion of  the  road\r\n\r\nreferred  to by the Member. Besides traffic  flow\r\n\r\nalong  Mountbatten Road is regulated  by  traffic\r\n\r\nlight  controls  at  Guillemard  Circus  and  the\r\n\r\njunction  of the Old Airport Road and Mountbatten\r\n\r\nRoad,  thereby facilitating pedestrians  crossing\r\n\r\nthe   road.  A  pedestrian  overhead  bridge  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   not  necessary  at  this   juncture.\r\n\r\nHowever,  on completion of the National  Stadium,\r\n\r\nwhich  is what the Member is looking forward  to,\r\n\r\nthe Public Works Department will certainly review\r\n\r\nthe situation and build an overhead bridge, if it\r\n\r\nis considered necessary. In my view, without even\r\n\r\nlooking into the future, I am sure the Member  is\r\n\r\nright  in saying that an overhead bridge will  be\r\n\r\nneeded   when  the  Stadium  is  completed.   The\r\n\r\nprovision  of an underpass is, I am  afraid,  not\r\n\r\nfeasible as the location in question is  just  by\r\n\r\nthe side of a big canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> In view of the answer given by\r\n\r\nthe Minister, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 75 be\r\n\r\nreduced  by $10 in respect of item 006 of subhead\r\n\r\n310.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to\r\n\r\ndraw  the attention of the Minister for  Law  and\r\n\r\nNational  Development to some of the bus shelters\r\n\r\nfrom  Upper  Serangoon Road, 64 m.s., to  Punggol\r\n\r\nPoint.

Surely a new town like Toa Payoh deserves\r\n\r\nsomething  more  attractive than second-hand  bus\r\n\r\nshelters!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of bus bays. I believe\r\n\r\nthat  when bus bays are constructed, arrangements\r\n\r\nshould  be made with the relevant authorities  to\r\n\r\nsite  the bus stands near the bus bays. There  is\r\n\r\none bus bay in Toa Payoh which has not been used.\r\n\r\nThe  bus  bay is constructed but the bus stop  is\r\n\r\nfar  away from this bus bay, and one long trailer\r\n\r\nhas monopolised it as its parking lot for several\r\n\r\nmonths.  I would like to seek clarification  from\r\n\r\nthe Minister on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in the outlying rural areas\r\n\r\nlike  Punggol, where bus commuters are fewer than\r\n\r\nin  the  urban area, standard rural bus  shelters\r\n\r\nwith  a  floor area of about 60 square  feet  are\r\n\r\nconsidered  adequate. Seats are not provided  for\r\n\r\nthe shelter as they take up too much standing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroom.  But  where  the needs  are  justified,\r\n\r\nbigger  bus  shelters are constructed, like  those\r\n\r\nalong Upper Serangoon Road in Punggol, which  have\r\n\r\nbeen  provided with seats. Altogether six new  bus\r\n\r\nshelters  along  Punggol Road were constructed  in\r\n\r\n1971, in response to requests from the public  and\r\n\r\nthe  Citizens'  Consultative Committee.  More  bus\r\n\r\nshelters  will be provided if these are  requested\r\n\r\nfor and found necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Toa Payoh, I do not know\r\n\r\nwhy a trailer is parked on the bus bay, but if  he\r\n\r\nwill let me know where this bus bay is, I will ask\r\n\r\nmy  officials  to look into it. We can  build  bus\r\n\r\nbays,  but  we cannot force buses to  stop  within\r\n\r\nthem. Nor can we prevent trailers from parking  in\r\n\r\nbus bays until we get to know about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for second-hand equipment, perhaps anything\r\n\r\nsecond-hand  is  better  than  none.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\ndepartment  did not pull them out of  Punggol  and\r\n\r\nput them in Toa Payoh. I agree with the Member for\r\n\r\nToa Payoh that a new town like Toa Payoh needs new\r\n\r\nbus shelters. I promise that I will do my best not\r\n\r\nto  renovate  the  old but to  give  him  new  bus\r\n\r\nshelters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the Minister has just\r\n\r\nmentioned that since Punggol is an outlying  area,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the  bus  shelters  there   are   much\r\n\r\nsmaller.  Let  me  say  that  even  if  these  bus\r\n\r\nshelters are pulled out of Punggol, I do not think\r\n\r\nthey would be put in Toa Payoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which the Minister just pointed\r\n\r\nout  is  that since the bus shelters along Punggol\r\n\r\nRoad are smaller, about 60 square feet, therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  is no need to have seats. Sir, in the light\r\n\r\nof  some  vigorous comments from this  House  last\r\n\r\nweek  with regard to commuters having to wait  for\r\n\r\nquite  some  time  before a bus comes  along  -  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  to some extent this is also true for  bus\r\n\r\ncommuters in the Punggol Road area - I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  reconsider  my  request  before\r\n\r\nasking for permission to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, though these bus shelters in\r\n\r\nPunggol are small, six of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  were  built last year. Six is a considerable\r\n\r\nnumber  compared  with that for  Tanglin!  I  have\r\n\r\nalways stated that we are open to request. If  the\r\n\r\nMember for Punggol can justify his representation,\r\n\r\nwe  will  certainly provide him with bus shelters,\r\n\r\nperhaps even bigger ones with seats thrown in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I must thank the Minister\r\n\r\nfor his assurance, and I beg leave to withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $15,803,000 for Head 75 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 76 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper Supplement -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuan Hail Mohd.
