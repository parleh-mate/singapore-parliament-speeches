However, he said that he\r\n\r\nhad received negative feedback to this idea, and then gave an\r\n\r\naccount  of  the personal experience of one of his grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"He came across a new product in Italy that was\r\n\r\nsuperior and would prove to be an advantage in bidding for  a\r\n\r\ncertain Government tender. Being a small-time businessman, he\r\n\r\napproached  a GLC to jointly pursue this Italian contact.  He\r\n\r\nthought  he  could  trust the GLC without signing  a  binding\r\n\r\njoint  venture  contract or non-circumvention agreement.  ...\r\n\r\nWhen he brought the Italian principals to Singapore, the  GLC\r\n\r\npartner  ferried  them away, bought them an expensive  dinner\r\n\r\nand  proposed  to  deal directly. With the  GLC's  immaculate\r\n\r\ncredentials, it is no surprise that the Italian  company  was\r\n\r\nconvinced  to deal with the GLC directly, and the  small  guy\r\n\r\nwas excluded from the arrangements.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, according to Mr Ong Kian Min, the grassroots\r\n\r\nleader  alleged  that  a  GLC  had  acted  dishonourably   in\r\n\r\nexcluding   him  from  a  business  arrangement,  which   the\r\n\r\ngrassroots leader had introduced to the GLC, and that the GLC\r\n\r\nhad reneged on an agreement to jointly pursue the contact, by\r\n\r\ndealing directly with his Italian principal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLC concerned is Unicorn International. The Italian\r\n\r\nprincipal  referred  to  was FB Design,  and  the  Government\r\n\r\ncontract  relates to a Mindef tender.  The grassroots  leader\r\n\r\nwas  Mr Ng Cheng Hwee of Amos Industries.  Mr Ng subsequently\r\n\r\ntold  the Sunday Times on 19th March 2000 that the GLC  \"then\r\n\r\nproceeded  to  ask a sister company to try and displace  Amos\r\n\r\nfrom  its  existing  servicing contract with  the  government\r\n\r\nagency\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have investigated the case and am satisfied that the\r\n\r\nallegations  have  no  merit.  Unicorn  International   acted\r\n\r\ncorrectly  and  honourably in its  dealings  with  the  local\r\n\r\ncompany,  Amos  Industries,  and its  Italian  principal,  FB\r\n\r\nDesign.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the incident are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1997, Mr Ng approached Unicorn on a possible\r\n\r\ncollaboration  to market to Mindef a product manufactured  by\r\n\r\nFB  Design.  Mr Ng represented to Unicorn that Amos  was  the\r\n\r\nsole  and exclusive agent in Singapore for FB Design. On this\r\n\r\nbasis, Unicorn and Amos agreed that Unicorn would submit  the\r\n\r\ntender to Mindef, while Amos would not. Mr Ng confirmed  this\r\n\r\nin  writing on 5th September 1997. FB Design also affirmed Mr\r\n\r\nNg's  fax that \"Unicorn will be the prime contractor for  the\r\n\r\ntender\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10th June 1998, FB Design stated in a letter to\r\n\r\nUnicorn, which was copied to Amos, that Amos was its agent in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and was rewarded on a commission basis,  and  that\r\n\r\nAmos  had  not  been given any contractual capabilities,  ie,\r\n\r\nAmos  did  not have the right to enter into any contracts  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of FB Design. Once the tender requirements were clear,\r\n\r\nFB  Design would offer the product directly to, and  possibly\r\n\r\nsign a contract with Mindef, or Unicorn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mindef has confirmed that Amos was not a\r\n\r\npre-qualified  supplier  and  thus  could  not  bid  for  the\r\n\r\ncontract directly.  Since Amos was not in a position  to  bid\r\n\r\nfor  the  contract in the first place, there is no  basis  to\r\n\r\nclaim  that Amos decided not to enter into any joint  venture\r\n\r\nagreement or non-circumvention agreement with Unicorn because\r\n\r\nit felt it could trust Unicorn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At meetings conducted on 11th and 12th August 1998,\r\n\r\nUnicorn  management  met FB Design representatives  in  Singa\r\n\r\npore. Mr Ng was present. It was agreed that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Unicorn would be the party which would submit the\r\n\r\ntender bid to Mindef;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) FB Design would submit a quote directly to Unicorn\r\n\r\nfor  the  supply  of  the  products required  by  Mindef.  FB\r\n\r\nDesign's quote would include Amos' contractual commission;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In the event that Unicorn succeeded in the tender,\r\n\r\nFB Design would pay Amos its contractual commission; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Amos would provide Unicorn with the requisite\r\n\r\nservices  for  Mindef's maintenance and service  requirements\r\n\r\nduring the one-year warranty period, the understanding  being\r\n\r\nthat  Amos  would  give a reasonable quote  for  its  service\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting on 11th August, the Unicorn and FB\r\n\r\nDesign  representatives proceeded for dinner. Mr Ng  did  not\r\n\r\nattend  the  dinner because FB Design brought along  a  guest\r\n\r\nknown  to  Unicorn, but not to Mr Ng. This was the \"expensive\r\n\r\ndinner\"  which  Mr Ong Kian Min referred to. In  reality,  it\r\n\r\ncost only S$375.58 for six persons, or about $63 per head.  A\r\n\r\nlunch  the  next  day with the same FB Design representatives\r\n\r\nincluded Mr Ng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear that all material discussions on\r\n\r\nthe  transaction  took  place in Amos' presence,  with  Amos'\r\n\r\nconsent on the agreed terms. It was FB Design which chose  to\r\n\r\ndeal  directly with Unicorn. At no point did Unicorn  propose\r\n\r\nto  deal directly with the Italians, or exclude Amos from the\r\n\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, Unicorn sought Amos' quote for its\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  service charges for the  one-year  warranty\r\n\r\nperiod. Amos quoted an unrealistically large sum, compared to\r\n\r\nfigures  furnished  by FB Design. When this  was  brought  to\r\n\r\nAmos'  attention, they insisted on maintaining  their  price.\r\n\r\nThis  threatened to make the bid uncompetitive.  Unicorn  was\r\n\r\nthus   compelled  to  approach  various  parties  to  provide\r\n\r\nalternative quotes, of which only ST Marine reverted. Even ST\r\n\r\nMarine's price was not low enough.  Unicorn therefore did not\r\n\r\ngive the maintenance contract to either Amos or ST Marine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef awarded the tender in March 1999. Unicorn failed\r\n\r\nto  secure the contract. Amos complained to Mindef  the  same\r\n\r\nmonth. Mindef investigated the matter and found the complaint\r\n\r\nto be without merit. Mindef replied to Amos as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our investigations showed that Unicorn International\r\n\r\nhad  never requested FB Design for the agency right. We  also\r\n\r\nlearned  that  when your Company's agency agreement  with  FB\r\n\r\nexpired in December 1998, FB did not appoint UI or any  other\r\n\r\nparty as their new agent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this reply, Mr Ng was not satisfied. Hence,\r\n\r\nafter Mr Ong Kian Min raised the matter in Parliament, Mr  Ng\r\n\r\nspoke to the press to voice his grievances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the facts of the case show that the\r\n\r\naccusations  against Unicorn International have no  basis.  I\r\n\r\nhave  laid  out  the  details  of  the  entire  incident   in\r\n\r\nParliament today, because the Government takes allegations of\r\n\r\nmisconduct  or  unfair practices by GLCs very  seriously.  We\r\n\r\nhave  made it clear, both to GLCs and to the public, that  we\r\n\r\nexpect  GLCs  to maintain the highest standards of  corporate\r\n\r\nconduct.  We  will  not  tolerate any  unethical  or  illegal\r\n\r\nbehaviour  by GLCs, and will act swiftly and firmly  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  any wrong-doing. At the same time, we cannot allow  the\r\n\r\nreputations   of  our  GLCs  to  be  smeared   by   unfounded\r\n\r\nallegations.  The  GLCs  have painstakingly  built  up  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  reputations over the years.  Any  accusation\r\n\r\nagainst a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGLC   must  either  be  refuted  conclusively,  or  else   be\r\n\r\nsubstantiated and the GLC put right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that after Mr Ong Kian Min spoke in\r\n\r\nParliament  on  8th  March 2000, he had been  in  touch  with\r\n\r\nUnicorn International, which had informed him of the facts of\r\n\r\nthe  case. Subsequently, Mr Ong told the Sunday Times on 19th\r\n\r\nMarch 2000 that the matter was \"a misunderstanding\". However,\r\n\r\nthe   matter  could  not  be  left  there  unresolved.    The\r\n\r\n\"misunderstanding\"  had to be properly and  publicly  cleared\r\n\r\nup.  I  therefore  thank Mr Ong for asking  the  question  in\r\n\r\nParliament, and giving me the opportunity to put the facts on\r\n\r\nthe public record.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I thank the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  his  full investigation and comprehensive reply.   I  am\r\n\r\nsatisfied   that   Unicorn   International   acted   properly\r\n\r\nthroughout this transaction.  In raising this matter I had no\r\n\r\nintention  of misleading anyone into thinking that  our  GLCs\r\n\r\nwere   adopting  cut-throat  business  practices.   If   such\r\n\r\nimpression was indeed created, I apologise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note the Minister's reassurance to this\r\n\r\nHouse  that the Government expects all our GLCs to adhere  to\r\n\r\nresponsible business practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Having\r\n\r\nheard  the Minister, may I ask whether the Minister does  not\r\n\r\nthink it right that perhaps it is time that a Board of Ethics\r\n\r\nbe appointed to investigate any misconduct or malpractices of\r\n\r\nany sort in the business sector in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I have just explained that there\r\n\r\nwas  no  misconduct  in this case.

Before 15th March\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyear,  under the old T + 5 settlement system, investors often\r\n\r\ndid  not have to pay up until 12 days after their trades were\r\n\r\nexecuted.  The contra buyer could sell on the fifth day after\r\n\r\nthe  initial purchase, and only pay the broker the difference\r\n\r\nbetween the purchase and sale prices after settlement of  the\r\n\r\ncontra  sale, which was another six days later.  In addition,\r\n\r\nbrokers  often  extended informal credit, so  that  when  the\r\n\r\nmarket  entered  a downswing, some customers  would  default,\r\n\r\nexacerbating the problem of contra losses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have shortened the settlement cycle to T +\r\n\r\n3,  contra  trading  has become less  attractive.   This  may\r\n\r\ndampen   market   turnover.   Brokers   have   responded   by\r\n\r\nintroducing  new  forms of financing for their  clients,  and\r\n\r\nreviving  older forms.  For example, at least one  broker  is\r\n\r\ngiving  its  preferred clients up to 14  days  interest  free\r\n\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where securities firms are concerned, the Singapore\r\n\r\nExchange  (SGX)  requires its members to  impose  an  initial\r\n\r\nmargin  requirement of at least 50%.  This means that  if  an\r\n\r\ninvestor  buys $2,000 worth of securities, he  must  pay  the\r\n\r\nfirst  $1,000 upfront.  SGX rules also require the broker  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  margin  call when the value of the securities  falls\r\n\r\nbelow  $1,800.  If the investor is unable to meet  the  call,\r\n\r\nthe  broker  will  sell  the  securities  and  liquidate  the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These margin requirements have helped to keep our\r\n\r\nstockbroking  firms  healthy and not over  exposed  to  risk.\r\n\r\nThey  should adequately protect the firms should  the  market\r\n\r\nturn  down.  From the macro perspective, the rules have  also\r\n\r\nprevented  excessive leverage in the stock market, much  like\r\n\r\nMAS' rules on property financing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these margin requirements do not currently\r\n\r\napply  to banks, or to other lenders that are not members  of\r\n\r\nthe  SGX.   Hence,  UOB could recently offer  customers  100%\r\n\r\nshare financing up to six times their monthly salary, so that\r\n\r\nthey can buy shares without putting up any money upfront.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our banks are well capitalised. Margin loans form only\r\n\r\na  small  percentage of their total loan portfolio.   MAS  is\r\n\r\ntherefore not worried that the banks will become over exposed\r\n\r\nto  the  stock market.  However, MAS is concerned  that  over\r\n\r\ngenerous  margin loans may create froth in the stock  market,\r\n\r\nand  increase market volatility.  They may also  lead  to  an\r\n\r\nexcessive   expansion  of  consumer  borrowing,   and   tempt\r\n\r\nindividuals to speculate in shares beyond the limits of  what\r\n\r\nthey can afford.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US Federal Reserve Board (FRB) imposes margin\r\n\r\nrequirements  on  brokers, banks and non-bank intermediaries.\r\n\r\nAll  providers of share financing are required to  impose  an\r\n\r\ninitial margin requirement of at least 50%.  There is thus  a\r\n\r\nlevel  playing  field, unlike in Singapore.  The  US  Federal\r\n\r\nReserve  Board requires investors to pay $1,000 upfront   for\r\n\r\n$2,000  worth  of  securities.  The  exchanges  also  require\r\n\r\nmargin  calls  to  be made when the value of  the  securities\r\n\r\nfalls  below $1,333.  This is more liberal than our threshold\r\n\r\nof  $1,800,  but,  in practice, many American  broker-dealers\r\n\r\nmaintain   stricter  internal  policies  on  initial   margin\r\n\r\nrequirements as well as margin calls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the US stock market has risen, margin debt has grown\r\n\r\nsharply.   There  have been calls on the  FRB  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nmargin requirement, especially after the recent volatility in\r\n\r\nUS  equity  prices.  The FRB has not agreed to  do  so.   Its\r\n\r\nposition  is that the present requirements are adequate,  but\r\n\r\nit   is   continuing   to  monitor  the   situation.    Other\r\n\r\ncommentators have observed that margin financing is only  one\r\n\r\nform  of  leverage in the stock market, and is still  only  a\r\n\r\nsmall percentage of total market capitalisation in the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is reviewing whether to extend limits on margin\r\n\r\nfinancing across the broad spectrum of margin providers,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  our present requirements provide the proper  balance\r\n\r\nin our markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister whether the new financing by financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions has aggravated the stock market fluctuations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore recently?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I doubt it, because I do not\r\n\r\nthink  the volume is very large.

And   we  also  want  to  make  sure   that   the\r\n\r\nintermediaries, like the brokers and the banks, do  not  over\r\n\r\nlend.   Because  if there is a default, it is  not  just  the\r\n\r\nindividual  customer's  problem or  the  individual  broker's\r\n\r\nproblem,  but it could become a systemic problem, as  Members\r\n\r\nwill  remember  from Pan Electric.  When  Pan  Electric  went\r\n\r\nbust,  a  lot  of brokers found that they had  over  extended\r\n\r\nthemselves  and  several went out of  business.   We  had  to\r\n\r\norganise  a life boat fund to try and rescue the rest,  which\r\n\r\nwe  succeeded  in  doing.  So there  is  a  need  for  margin\r\n\r\nrequirements.  The question is how strict they should be, and\r\n\r\nhow  they  should  be applied, and what  we  should  do  with\r\n\r\nbrokers  and  non-brokers.   These are things  which  we  are\r\n\r\nstudying now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, may I ask the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  regardless of whether the Government  thinks  that\r\n\r\nmargin  debt  is the cause or the effect of a rising  market,\r\n\r\nwould  the MAS use the percentage of margin debt to the stock\r\n\r\nmarket  capitalisation as a benchmark when deciding on margin\r\n\r\nrequirements?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I think the two have different\r\n\r\nparameters.    The  percentage  of  margin  debt   to   total\r\n\r\ncapitalisation  is  very small.  We  do  not  have  an  exact\r\n\r\nnumber,  but  I  said  it is about 1%.   Whereas  the  margin\r\n\r\nrequirement relates not to the size of that debt but  to  the\r\n\r\nvolatility  of the debt.  Because if you bought shares  worth\r\n\r\n$2,000,  and  you  have  paid $1,000, you  still  owe  $1,000\r\n\r\nsecured against the $2,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npiece  of paper  -  shares.  If the shares go down to $1,500,\r\n\r\nyou  still owe $1,000, but it is only secured against  $1,500\r\n\r\nof shares.   If your broker is slow to sell and liquidate the\r\n\r\nposition,  he  may find the market has moved further  against\r\n\r\nhim  and  then  he has a loss on his hands.   So  it  is  the\r\n\r\nvolatility which concerns us when we have to judge how  tight\r\n\r\nto make that margin financing limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BOND EXCHANGE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Setting up)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwhether the Monetary Authority of Singapore will help set  up\r\n\r\na  bond  exchange, especially as an electronic  platform,  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  bond-trading  for both  institutions  and  retail\r\n\r\ninvestors,  as  well as to further establish Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nregional debt hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few\r\n\r\nyears,  rapid  advances  in electronic  bond  technology  has\r\n\r\ncaused electronic bond trading systems to proliferate in  the\r\n\r\nUS  and  Europe.   These range from the Euro-MTS,  which  was\r\n\r\nlaunched  in Europe in June 1999 by 24 financial institutions\r\n\r\nwho  are  primary dealers in the various European  government\r\n\r\nsecurities  markets, to exchange systems  operated  by  stock\r\n\r\nexchanges like the New York Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic bond systems bring several benefits to the\r\n\r\nbond   market.

For the bond  investor,  electronic\r\n\r\nplatforms offer greater transparency, lower transaction costs\r\n\r\nand more value-added services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more important than state-of-the-art electronic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure are the fundamental conditions  for  efficient\r\n\r\nand  liquid bond markets.

We will\r\n\r\nadopt  many  features of the Hyde Park  example  in  our  own\r\n\r\nSpeakers'  Corner.  I will ask the Clerk  to  distribute  the\r\n\r\ncomparison  (Cols. 77-80) of the conditions of our  Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner  and  the  Hyde  Park  Speakers'  Corner.  [Copies  of\r\n\r\ndocument  distributed to hon. Members].   Members  can  study\r\n\r\nthat afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000425/20000425-HA-0720077.htm\">comparison - COMPARISON OF HYDE PARK'S SPEAKERS' CORNER AND SINGAPORE'S SPEAKERS' CORNER AT HONG LIM PARK (Cols. 77-80)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now outline my Ministry's plans for the Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner and the basic rules that would govern its operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me address the choice of venue. The\r\n\r\nSpeakers' Corner will be set up at Hong Lim Park.    It  will\r\n\r\nbe  open during the daylight hours of 7 am to 7 pm, 7 days  a\r\n\r\nweek, throughout the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also ask the Clerk to distribute a map (Cols. 81-82) which shows the exact extent or location of the Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner.   [Copies of document distributed to  hon.  Members].\r\n\r\nHong  Lim Park is easily accessible and close to the business\r\n\r\ndistrict and Chinatown, which are areas of high\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcentration  of  people  and  activities.    It   is   also\r\n\r\nhistorically  the venue for political rallies  and  speeches.\r\n\r\nThe Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post nearby will make  it\r\n\r\nconvenient for speakers to register to use the Corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000425/20000425-HA-0720081.gif\">map - SPEAKERS' CORNER AT HONG LIM PARK (Cols. 81-82)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry considered other possible locations, such as\r\n\r\nthe  Padang,  the  Civic Plaza at Ngee Ann City,  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nPark,  and  the  Botanic Gardens.  However,  they  were  less\r\n\r\nsuitable  for  various  reasons, such  as  interference  with\r\n\r\nfrequent  commercial or sporting activities, relatively  poor\r\n\r\naccessibility and redevelopment in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will only be one Speakers' Corner. Given\r\n\r\nSingapore's  population and geographical size,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nneed  for  more  than one such venue, nor to have  venues  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  sizes to cater to different levels  of  formality.\r\n\r\nEven  London, with a population of over seven million  people\r\n\r\nand  about  three times the size of Singapore, has  only  one\r\n\r\nSpeakers'  Corner at Hyde Park.  There have been  suggestions\r\n\r\nto set up more such venues in the UK, but these are for other\r\n\r\ncities across the country, rather than for London itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ground rules will ensure that speakers and audience\r\n\r\nuse  the Speakers' Corner without creating a fracas,  or  law\r\n\r\nand order problems. There will be three basic conditions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The speaker must be a Singapore citizen;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The speaker must register his intention to speak\r\n\r\nbefore he makes his speech;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The speech should not be religious in nature, and\r\n\r\nshould  not  have the potential to cause feelings of  enmity,\r\n\r\nhatred,  ill-will  or hostility between different  racial  or\r\n\r\nreligious groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on each of these conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker must be a Singapore citizen. The Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner is meant to provide Singapore citizens with an avenue\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  express  their  views on issues that concern  them.   The\r\n\r\nCorner  should not become an avenue for foreigners to  pursue\r\n\r\ntheir  own  agenda whether in respect of their  own  domestic\r\n\r\nissues, or those of other countries, including Singapore's.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speakers must give notice of their intention to speak,\r\n\r\nand  present  themselves in person  to  show  that  they  are\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens, before they start speaking.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  simple requirement.  All they need to do is to turn  up\r\n\r\nin  person at the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post, which\r\n\r\nis right next to the Speakers' Corner, produce their identity\r\n\r\ncards  or  passports to prove their citizenship, and register\r\n\r\ntheir intent to speak. They need not inform the NPP what they\r\n\r\nintend  to speak on.  Approvals will be granted on the  spot,\r\n\r\nand they can then proceed to the Corner to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will allow advance registration by\r\n\r\nindividuals  who  wish to speak, but not advance  booking  of\r\n\r\nwhole  or  part  of the venue for an organised public  event.\r\n\r\nThis is to ensure that the Speakers' Corner remains available\r\n\r\nat  all  times to all Singaporeans who wish to speak, and  no\r\n\r\nperson or group can take over whole or part of the venue  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No speeches that would cause racial or religious enmity.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  multi-racial, multi-religious  society.  To\r\n\r\nsafeguard  racial and religious harmony, the  rules  prohibit\r\n\r\nreligious speeches, and speeches that would cause feelings of\r\n\r\nenmity,  hatred,  ill-will  or  hostility  between  different\r\n\r\nracial or religious groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers can speak on any other subject they wish,\r\n\r\nin  any of our official languages.  They must naturally abide\r\n\r\nby  the  laws of Singapore, including the Sedition  Act,  the\r\n\r\nMaintenance of Religious Harmony Act and the Penal Code.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  if  a speaker issues a threat to kill  someone,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  treated as criminal intimidation.   A  speaker  who\r\n\r\nmakes slanderous remarks can be sued for defamation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the Hyde Park Speakers' Corner, no sound\r\n\r\namplification  devices will be allowed.  This  is  to  reduce\r\n\r\nnoise  pollution, and ensure that no one speaker  drowns  out\r\n\r\nthe other speakers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will adopt a minimalist, hands-off approach\r\n\r\ntowards  the  Speakers' Corner. The Police will  not  try  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  activities there, as long as there  is  no  law  and\r\n\r\norder  problem.  But should rioting, affray, or a  breach  of\r\n\r\nthe  peace occur, the Police will take firm action to prevent\r\n\r\nthe  situation  from getting out of hand.  For  less  serious\r\n\r\noffences,  the  Police will investigate and take  appropriate\r\n\r\naction,   ranging  from  verbal  and  written   warnings   to\r\n\r\nsuspensions  from  speaking at the Corner, depending  on  the\r\n\r\nseverity of the breach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Chin has asked about the steps to be taken\r\n\r\nto establish the Speakers' Corner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs will gazette an exemption\r\n\r\nunder  the  Public Entertainments (PE) Act to  exempt  public\r\n\r\nspeeches  at  Speakers'  Corner from licensing  requirements.\r\n\r\nThe  exemption order will specify the three basic  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have  just  outlined.   Regulations  will  also  be\r\n\r\nrequired to facilitate the smooth operation of the Corner  as\r\n\r\nwell as to deal with any breaches of the conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some physical improvement works will also\r\n\r\nbe  carried out at the site. For example, signages need to be\r\n\r\nerected,  and the boundaries of the Speakers' Corner  clearly\r\n\r\ndemarcated,  so  that  speakers will know  where  the  Corner\r\n\r\nextends to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are targeting to complete all preparations and launch\r\n\r\nthe Speakers' Corner by end August 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Just a matter of\r\n\r\nclarification,  Sir.   The Minister just  now  mentioned  the\r\n\r\nregistration  process and said that once the registration  is\r\n\r\ndone, permission would be given to speak.  I would just  like\r\n\r\nhim  to clarify that actually no permission needs to be given\r\n\r\nbecause  it is just a registration process and it  is  to  be\r\n\r\ndistinguished from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   licensing  process,  which  is  a  different  form   of\r\n\r\nregistration.  That is the first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is this. The Minister points out that\r\n\r\nthere  will be very few uniformed officers on patrol  in  the\r\n\r\nSpeakers'  Corner.  What would happen if  there  is  a  rowdy\r\n\r\nscene  provoked by speeches or otherwise?  What would  happen\r\n\r\nin that case?  Who will maintain law and order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Firstly, Prof. Chin is right. The\r\n\r\nlicensing  requirement  is  granted  an  exemption   by   the\r\n\r\nExemption  Order of the Public Entertainments Act.   All  the\r\n\r\nspeaker  needs to do is to put his name down and he would  be\r\n\r\ngiven a form which would state the conditions.  He would sign\r\n\r\nit  and he would go forth and speak.  In that sense, there is\r\n\r\nno  licensing.   It  is  simply that  he  has  indicated  his\r\n\r\ninterest  and  then he can go ahead and speak,  having  taken\r\n\r\nnote  of  the conditions.  For people who go to the Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner  and  speak there or as a member of the  audience,  we\r\n\r\nhope  that  they will be sensible enough not to  provoke  any\r\n\r\ndisturbance and not to disturb the peace.  Of course, if  the\r\n\r\npeace  is disturbed and people complain about it, the  Police\r\n\r\nwill be there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to seek the Minister's view on the significance of  the\r\n\r\nSpeakers' Corner to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> This subject was raised last year and\r\n\r\nthere  was  a lot of public interest among certain groups  of\r\n\r\npeople  who said that we should be like some other countries.\r\n\r\nWe  should have a free speech corner to allow people  to  say\r\n\r\nanything  they want without regulations and without the  need\r\n\r\nto  apply for a Public Entertainments licence and so on.   We\r\n\r\nthought  it was not quite a good idea.  But, in the  end,  we\r\n\r\nthought  that if that is really what the people want  and  we\r\n\r\ncan  manage the risk, we will provide for it.  Basically,  if\r\n\r\nthe people really want this, we will let them try it out.  We\r\n\r\nhope that they can make it succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, since there are\r\n\r\nno qualified privileges and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  defamation  law  will be enforced, will  there  be  tape\r\n\r\nrecorders around to tape every word that a speaker says?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I think the police has a lot of\r\n\r\nbetter  things to do than just to carry a tape  recorder  and\r\n\r\ntape  speeches.   But Mr Chiam should not be suspicious  when\r\n\r\npeople  turn up with a tape recorder.  Let me tell  him  why.\r\n\r\nBecause this is something new, there could be people who  are\r\n\r\ninterested  to go there to speak and perhaps to make  a  name\r\n\r\nfor  themselves.  There could also be people who  are  really\r\n\r\ninterested to find out what is going on and what the speakers\r\n\r\nwill  say.   Maybe  they will say something interesting.   So\r\n\r\ncurious  onlookers may carry a tape recorder.  Or a  research\r\n\r\nstudent, for example, writing about political developments in\r\n\r\nSingapore and he thinks that it is such a grand thing that we\r\n\r\nhave  taken  such a step, he may carry a tape recorder.   Who\r\n\r\nknows?   Journalists will also carry a tape  recorder.   They\r\n\r\nwill  even  carry  a  video recorder, and  not  just  a  tape\r\n\r\nrecorder.  Therefore, Mr Chiam should not be suspicious.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, if he has something to say, do not be  afraid\r\n\r\nto say it.  That is the best test, is that not?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  must compliment the  Government  for  this\r\n\r\ndecision, but I have a couple of questions.  First,  I  am  a\r\n\r\nlittle bit concerned about the location of Hong Lim Park.   I\r\n\r\nknow  that historically it may be good, but I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Government whether they are prepared to change  the\r\n\r\nlocation  if  in future it is found that other locations  are\r\n\r\nmore  suitable, for example, Bras Basah Park, with  its  more\r\n\r\nintellectual   atmosphere  with  the   Singapore   Management\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government spoke about enforcement.\r\n\r\nThere  is a difference here.  If somebody were to speak quite ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Zulkifli, can you move on to your\r\n\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> If he does not provoke\r\n\r\nsomeone, but a passer-by just decides to break a park  bench,\r\n\r\nis  the police going to prosecute the speaker or the guy  who\r\n\r\nbreaks  the park bench?  Can the Minister please clarify  the\r\n\r\nlevel  of  enforcement  and  against  whom  is  he  enforcing\r\n\r\nagainst?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I have mentioned that the Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  Park is not suitable, if that is his suggestion.  Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  Park  is  going  to  be  redeveloped  because  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Management University.  Hong Lim Park is actually a\r\n\r\nvery  suitable  location.   It has  historical  significance.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the most fiery and important speeches were made  at\r\n\r\nHong  Lim Park.  So there is a good reason to go to Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nPark and it is very convenient.  It is very accessible.   The\r\n\r\nMRT station is nearby.  It is within walking distance of many\r\n\r\noffice  workers and even those going home will pass by there.\r\n\r\nThere  are two MRT lines, the North-East line as well as  the\r\n\r\nline  running along Raffles Place.  So I do not think we need\r\n\r\nto  worry  about  the  location because  once  the  place  is\r\n\r\nestablished as a Speakers' Corner, people will turn up.  Have\r\n\r\nMembers been to Hyde Park?  It is a very large place and  yet\r\n\r\npeople  know where the Hyde Park Speakers' Corner  is.   They\r\n\r\nare not afraid of losing their way just because it is in some\r\n\r\nquiet place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enforcement, as I have said, we hope people will\r\n\r\nbehave  themselves and not provoke anybody.  If there  should\r\n\r\nbe  a  case to be investigated, it must depend on the  facts,\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances and the evidence.   The police just cannot\r\n\r\ngo  around  chasing and prosecuting everybody.  That  is  not\r\n\r\nwhat the police does.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister,\r\n\r\nand  I  hope it is not to be thought impertinent, but because\r\n\r\nof  the view expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister that this\r\n\r\nwas  merely  symbolism, whether the Government  is  seriously\r\n\r\nintent on promoting free speech in Singapore or is this  just\r\n\r\nanother  mere  show?   If  it  is  seriously  interested   in\r\n\r\npromoting free speech, would the Minister agree to an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopen debate with the Workers' Party outside?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam has always asked\r\n\r\nfor  a  debate.  We can have a lot of debates in this  House.\r\n\r\nAny  time  he wants it, we can have it. And he can  stand  up\r\n\r\nthere  and make his speech as he wants, except that  when  we\r\n\r\ngive  an answer, he is not around to listen.  So there is  no\r\n\r\npoint  talking about a debate with us when he does  not  even\r\n\r\nbother  to stay in the House.  There is nothing to  stop  him\r\n\r\nfrom going to the Speakers' Corner and make a speech.  So, do\r\n\r\nnot  worry about where.  If he wants to debate, do  it  right\r\n\r\nhere.   This is where the public forum really is for a proper\r\n\r\npolicy debate, not in the Speakers' Corner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me put it more seriously. It is not just a\r\n\r\nquestion  of symbolism.  Of course, we have a place to  show.\r\n\r\nIt  is symbolism in the sense that, yes, if you want a place,\r\n\r\nthere  is a place.  But for free speech, I think we must  not\r\n\r\ndelude  ourselves.  He can do so on the Internet.  He can  do\r\n\r\nso  with  the  press.  He can do so in any  place  he  wants,\r\n\r\nsubject  to  the rules of the land.  And he can do  so  right\r\n\r\nhere.  So, what is the worry about having free speech?  There\r\n\r\nis  free speech all the time.  It is a question of whether he\r\n\r\nis  prepared  to have it or not.  Do not run  away  from  it.\r\n\r\nWhen we give him an answer, stay here to listen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\ntwo questions for the Minister.

Move  the\r\n\r\nSpeakers' Corner to some other places?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I have is regarding the language\r\n\r\nused.  The rule says four official languages will be allowed.\r\n\r\nI  would like to find out from the Minister whether dialects,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  Hokkein,  Cantonese,  or  Teochew,  would  be\r\n\r\nallowed in the Speakers' Corner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, first, the question on\r\n\r\nredevelopment.  There is this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsaying  - I think you all understand - that when you  get  to\r\n\r\nthe bridge you will cross it.  You have not got to the bridge\r\n\r\nyet;   so   wait  for  the  time  to  come.   If   there   is\r\n\r\nredevelopment, we will find another place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On language, we say four official languages. But if he\r\n\r\ncannot speak any of them, and want to speak in Cantonese,  go\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will allow one more question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister: what is he\r\n\r\nafraid of about public debate?  Is he afraid of the public of\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  is he afraid of the Workers' Party?   Is  that\r\n\r\nwhat is worrying him?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I ask the Minister: is he aware that it is\r\n\r\nnot just Hyde Park where the people of London are allowed  to\r\n\r\nspeak up?  They can speak up anywhere else, and not only just\r\n\r\nin  London but in any other part of the country.   So  it  is\r\n\r\nnonsensical  to  say that London has only got  one  Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, why is there any need even for registration?\r\n\r\nMay  we have an assurance that the particulars of the speaker\r\n\r\nwill not be sent to the Internal Security Department?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if we are afraid of having a\r\n\r\ndebate with the Workers' Party, we would not be here.

Let\r\n\r\nme  answer  all  these Questions relating  to  harbouring  of\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, give the background and the reasons why\r\n\r\nwe  have  strict laws to deal with the immigration  offenders\r\n\r\nproblem.  This is not a new problem.  It has been with us for\r\n\r\na  long  time.   So long as Singapore's economy continues  to\r\n\r\ngrow,  there will always be desperate foreigners who want  to\r\n\r\ncome  in  here illegally and to stay here illegally  to  find\r\n\r\njobs.  They will pose a serious threat to Singapore's safety\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand security if they are allowed to remain here, particularly\r\n\r\nin large numbers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are four parties who contribute to this\r\n\r\nillegal  immigration problem: (i) the trafficker who smuggles\r\n\r\nin  the illegal immigrants, (ii) the illegal immigrant or the\r\n\r\noverstayer himself, (iii) the person who gives him a job, the\r\n\r\nemployer,  and  (iv) the person who gives  him  shelter.   We\r\n\r\ntherefore must have strict laws to deal with all of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of the problem is large. In 1998, about\r\n\r\n23,000 immigration offenders were arrested, comprising 14,700\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants  and  8,300  overstayers.   This   number\r\n\r\nremained  unacceptably  high  last  year,  with  some  17,000\r\n\r\narrested,  comprising  11,500 illegal  immigrants  and  5,500\r\n\r\noverstayers.   These  numbers have grown  steadily  over  the\r\n\r\nyears since the early 1980s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team adopts a multi-pronged approach in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the  immigration offenders problem.  To  deter  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  and their traffickers, the Singapore  Immigration\r\n\r\nand  Registration  (SIR) conducts strict checks  at  all  our\r\n\r\nentry  points.  More than 40 Police Coast Guard boats  patrol\r\n\r\nour  waters  intensively  every  day.   The  Police  and  SIR\r\n\r\nregularly conduct raids at construction sites, forested areas\r\n\r\nand   other  possible  hideouts  to  arrest  and  flush   out\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these efforts will come to nought if we do not\r\n\r\ndeal with the people who maintain, support or facilitate  the\r\n\r\nimmigration   offenders'  stay  in  Singapore,  namely,   the\r\n\r\nemployers and harbourers of immigration offenders.   So  long\r\n\r\nas  there  is  work  or  a  place to  stay,  the  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders   problem  cannot  be  tackled   effectively.    By\r\n\r\nproviding  them work or a place to stay, these employers  and\r\n\r\nlandlords  make  it harder for the authorities  to  find  and\r\n\r\ncatch   the  immigration offenders.   In  recent  years,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  persons  arrested  for  employing  or  harbouring\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders has increased from 230 in 1996, to  326\r\n\r\nin  1997,  436 in 1998 and 698 in 1999.  Stricter enforcement\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecent  years has led to more employers and harbourers  being\r\n\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1984, the Immigration Act has been amended several\r\n\r\ntimes  to  tighten  up  the  problems  of  enforcement.   The\r\n\r\nmandatory   jail   sentence  for  convicted  harbourers   and\r\n\r\nemployers  is not a new punishment introduced only  recently.\r\n\r\nLet   me  repeat  this:   The  mandatory  jail  sentence  for\r\n\r\nconvicted  harbourers and employers is not a  new  punishment\r\n\r\nintroduced  only  recently.  It was introduced  way  back  in\r\n\r\n1984,  when  the Immigration Act was amended to  provide  for\r\n\r\nenhanced   penalties  against  immigration   offenders,   and\r\n\r\nemployers  and  harbourers  of  immigration  offenders.   The\r\n\r\nmandatory  jail term is necessary to send a clear  signal  to\r\n\r\nall  would-be offenders of our tough stance towards those who\r\n\r\ngive shelter or work to immigration offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the amendments to the Immigration Act made in\r\n\r\n1993, the prosecution had difficulties in securing conviction\r\n\r\nof  errant  employers  and  landlords.   Many  employers  and\r\n\r\nharbourers  of  immigration  offenders  managed   to   secure\r\n\r\nacquittals by simply arguing that they were shown a  copy  of\r\n\r\nthe  work permit by the foreign worker, even though the  work\r\n\r\npermit later turned out to be a forged one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1991, Justice F.A. Chua in the High Court, held\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of Vadivelu that, to rebut the presumption  of\r\n\r\nknowledge  in a charge of harbouring an overstayer [and  this\r\n\r\ncase  refers to a harbourer], a person must show that he  has\r\n\r\nexercised  due  diligence  in  ascertaining  the  immigration\r\n\r\nstatus  of  the overstayer.  In that case, Justice Chua  said\r\n\r\nthat  the social policy of the Immigration Act, and  I  quote\r\n\r\nhim,   \"would   not  be  achieved  if  mere   negligence   or\r\n\r\nrecklessness on the part of the accused to enquire about  the\r\n\r\nstatus of the illegal immigrant or overstayer, if he knows or\r\n\r\nhas  reason to believe that the person is a foreigner,  would\r\n\r\nbe sufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an appeal case heard at the High Court in 1993, the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice  himself affirmed the strict  requirement  for\r\n\r\nemployers [and this time he refers to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployers]  to comply with the Immigration Act to  thoroughly\r\n\r\ncheck the foreign worker's status before employing him.   The\r\n\r\nChief  Justice said clearly and firmly in his judgement that,\r\n\r\nand  I  quote him, \"to allow an employer to evade the section\r\n\r\nby  shutting his eyes to the immigration or employment status\r\n\r\nof  his  foreign  employee, would  make  proper  control  and\r\n\r\nenforcement impossible.  It cannot be placing too  onerous  a\r\n\r\nduty  upon  employers in Singapore to require them to  screen\r\n\r\ntheir   foreign  workers  before  employing  them  to  ensure\r\n\r\ncompliance with immigration policy and the law.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is instructive to note that both the courts\r\n\r\nand  the  Government  are both agreed on  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nensuring  the  effective enforcement of our immigration  laws\r\n\r\nand  the  need to impose a high level of diligence  on  those\r\n\r\nemploying or giving shelter to foreigners.  By ensuring  that\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders have no place to stay and no  place  to\r\n\r\nwork, we are addressing key factors on the demand side of the\r\n\r\nequation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a person who provides shelter or work to the\r\n\r\nforeigner  must  exercise due diligence in  letting  out  his\r\n\r\npremises to foreigners or in employing them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the observations of the Chief Justice, the\r\n\r\nImmigration Act was amended in 1993 to expressly require both\r\n\r\nemployers  and  landlords to carry out certain basic  checks,\r\n\r\nfailing  which  they  would  be liable  for  the  offence  of\r\n\r\nemploying  or harbouring an immigration offender, should  the\r\n\r\nworker  or  tenant  turn  out to be  one.   The  employer  or\r\n\r\nlandlord  was  required  to  check  the  passport  or  travel\r\n\r\ndocument  of the foreigner he intended to employ or  let  out\r\n\r\nhis premises to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The due diligence requirements were refined again in\r\n\r\n1998,  to  make  clear  what  persons  who  give  shelter  to\r\n\r\nforeigners  must check before letting out their  premises  to\r\n\r\nthem,  and  in  view of the fact that visit  passes  were  no\r\n\r\nlonger endorsed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  passport.  The landlords were required to check  the\r\n\r\noriginal  immigration  and work passes, and  check  that  the\r\n\r\nparticulars  on the passports correspond with the particulars\r\n\r\nset  out  in  the  passes.   If the employer  is  named,  the\r\n\r\nlandlords should also check with the employers to verify that\r\n\r\nthe  prospective  tenants are indeed employed  by  them.   If\r\n\r\nemployers or landlords are not sure, they can also  call  SIR\r\n\r\nor  the  Ministry  of Manpower to check  the  status  of  the\r\n\r\nemployee or tenant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These due diligence requirements to check on potential\r\n\r\nworkers  or tenants are not onerous.  Indeed, they are  based\r\n\r\non  common  sense.   Surely,  it cannot  be  unreasonable  to\r\n\r\nrequire  the  employer or landlord to do some straightforward\r\n\r\nchecks  on  the  status of his foreign  employee  or  tenant,\r\n\r\nespecially  as  the safety and security of the community  and\r\n\r\ncountry are at stake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for such checks has been well-publicised. The\r\n\r\ndue  diligence requirements were publicised in the newspapers\r\n\r\nin  1993,  when  the requirements were first introduced.   In\r\n\r\n1998,  when  the  requirements were refined, they  were  also\r\n\r\npublicised.   These requirements have been  reported  through\r\n\r\nradio  and  television news stories.  These same requirements\r\n\r\nhave also been covered in the popular television documentary,\r\n\r\nCrime  Watch, in 1996, 1997, 1999 and this year, each episode\r\n\r\nattracting  about 730,000 viewers watching  the  English  and\r\n\r\nMandarin channels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB in 1998 sent out a letter to all the tenants and\r\n\r\nlessees  of  HDB  flats.   I  will  also  ask  the  Clerk  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  a  copy  of  that  letter.   [Copies  of   letter\r\n\r\ndistributed  to hon. Members].  This letter dated  20th  July\r\n\r\n1998 set out very clearly, step-by-step, what a landlord must\r\n\r\ndo  when  he  were to let out his premises.  And this  letter\r\n\r\nreaches  to  more than 80% of the Singapore households.   For\r\n\r\nthe  remainder, I suppose they are educated enough; otherwise\r\n\r\nthey  would not be living in private property and they should\r\n\r\nbe well read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently SIR has also pamphlets showing how to\r\n\r\nverify the status of foreigners and these have been placed at\r\n\r\nthe NPP and HDB branches.  In short, there has been more than\r\n\r\nenough  publicity  on this issue.  But we  will  continue  to\r\n\r\npublicise this and I have asked SIR to send the pamphlets  to\r\n\r\nall  households that pay property tax to remind them  of  the\r\n\r\nrequirements, and this will be done very soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides publicising the requirements of the law, the\r\n\r\nauthorities  have  also  been  meticulous  in  examining  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  and facts of each case, before a  decision  is\r\n\r\ntaken  as to whether to charge a landlord in Court.  Internal\r\n\r\nguidelines to determine whether an offender should be charged\r\n\r\nin  court have been in place all the while.  Over the  years,\r\n\r\nthe guidelines have been fine-tuned to ensure their relevance\r\n\r\nand effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a party to the 1993 Convention on the\r\n\r\nProhibition  of the Development, Production, Stockpiling  and\r\n\r\nUse  of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, or CWC for\r\n\r\nshort. We need to enact this law to implement our obligations\r\n\r\nunder   that  Convention.   The  Convention  banned  a  whole\r\n\r\ncategory  of  weapons of mass destruction and  established  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  verification  scheme  to  ensure  that  member\r\n\r\ncountries comply with their obligations under the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe  CWC  is  the result of 20 years of negotiations  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations Conference on Disarmament.  To date,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  ratified by 129 countries, including the United States,\r\n\r\nChina, Indonesia and Russia.  Singapore signed the Convention\r\n\r\nin 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I need not spell out for Members the horrifying\r\n\r\neffects  chemical  weapons can have on human  life.  To  make\r\n\r\nmatters  worse, chemical weapons are cheap and can be  easily\r\n\r\nproduced, requiring little by way of technical expertise  and\r\n\r\nraw  materials.  Unlike nuclear weapons, they can  easily  be\r\n\r\ndisseminated using commercially available equipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chemical weapons have been used in a number of armed\r\n\r\nconflicts  in the past causing death and injury to  millions.\r\n\r\nThe best known examples are during World War I, the Holocaust\r\n\r\nand  the  Iran-Iraq War.  A few years ago, the Aum  Shinrikyo\r\n\r\ncult  released  Sarin  gas into a Tokyo underground,  causing\r\n\r\n5,000  casualties.  It highlighted the fact  that  a  country\r\n\r\nremains at risk from a chemical attack even during peacetime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore ratified the CWC in 1997. Besides the obvious\r\n\r\nsecurity  benefits  in  a  world that  is  free  of  chemical\r\n\r\nweapons,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere   are  also  other  advantages  to  ratification.   The\r\n\r\nConvention  established the Organisation for the  Prohibition\r\n\r\nof   Chemical   Weapons  (OPCW).   As  a   member   of   that\r\n\r\nOrganisation, we can obtain technical assistance  from  other\r\n\r\nmember  countries  if threatened with an attack  by  chemical\r\n\r\nweapons.   Ratification is also expected to facilitate  trade\r\n\r\nin  chemicals  which are controlled by the  Convention.   The\r\n\r\nConvention   progressively  prohibits  transfers   of   these\r\n\r\nchemicals  to States that are not parties to the  Convention.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as a State Party, our chemical industries are  able\r\n\r\nto  freely import or export these chemicals to and from other\r\n\r\nState Parties for legitimate purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore does not produce or possess chemical\r\n\r\nweapons, nor do we have chemical weapons facilities or stocks\r\n\r\nto  destroy, as required by the Convention.  The verification\r\n\r\nmeasures required by the Convention have limited implications\r\n\r\non parts of our chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries\r\n\r\nwhich  I  will elaborate shortly.  The verification measures,\r\n\r\nwhich   consist   of  periodic  declarations  of   activities\r\n\r\ninvolving   chemicals  controlled  by  the   Convention   and\r\n\r\ninspections of facilities producing or using such  chemicals,\r\n\r\nare  necessary as a number of chemicals produced or used  for\r\n\r\nnormal  commercial activities also have applications  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacture of chemical weapons.  Therefore, these activities\r\n\r\nhave  to be constantly monitored to ensure that countries  do\r\n\r\nnot   use   their  commercial  chemical  industry   for   the\r\n\r\nclandestine production of chemical weapons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the salient provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\nClause  8  makes  it  an  offence to use,  develop,  produce,\r\n\r\nacquire,  stockpile, retain or transfer  a  chemical  weapon.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  obliged under the Convention to  prohibit  the\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  of  these  activities.   As  required  by  the\r\n\r\nConvention, this clause also applies to acts and omissions of\r\n\r\nour citizens overseas and persons on board ships and aircraft\r\n\r\nregistered  in  Singapore.   Penalties  for  committing   the\r\n\r\noffence  are  severe  to  reflect  its  seriousness  and  the\r\n\r\ndevastating effects of the use of chemical weapons  on  lives\r\n\r\nand property.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 creates a licensing system for the use,\r\n\r\ndevelopment, production, acquisition, stockpiling,  retention\r\n\r\nor  transfer  of scheduled chemicals for permitted  purposes.\r\n\r\nPermitted  purposes  include protective,  research,  medical,\r\n\r\npharmaceutical and law enforcement purposes.   The  licensing\r\n\r\nsystem  is administered by the National Authority, an  office\r\n\r\ncreated  as part of the Trade Development Board.  The  system\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate the gathering of information  from  chemical\r\n\r\nfacilities  to enable Singapore to make periodic declarations\r\n\r\nto  the Organisation established under the Convention.    For\r\n\r\nthe  same  reason,  clause  12 requires  those  carrying  out\r\n\r\nactivities  involving  such  chemicals  to  keep  appropriate\r\n\r\nrecords  and  provide certain information to the Director  of\r\n\r\nthe  National Authority, and clause 13 empowers the  Director\r\n\r\nto  require  any  person with information  relevant  to  such\r\n\r\ndeclaration to furnish the information to the Director.   Any\r\n\r\ninformation  so  provided is protected from disclosure  under\r\n\r\nclause  26.   This  is  to  give our  chemical  industry  the\r\n\r\nassurance that commercially sensitive information will always\r\n\r\nbe kept confidential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill provides for two types of inspections\r\n\r\nof   premises:   national   and  international   inspections.\r\n\r\nNational   inspections  are  carried  out  by  the   National\r\n\r\nAuthority  and police officers to determine if  the  Act  and\r\n\r\nregulations   have  been  complied  with  at  the   premises.\r\n\r\nInternational   inspections   are   carried   out   by    the\r\n\r\ninternational inspectors of the Organisation, OPCW, which can\r\n\r\nbe  of  two  types. They could either be routine or challenge\r\n\r\ninspections.    Routine  inspections  are  carried   out   at\r\n\r\nfacilities using controlled chemicals to ensure that such use\r\n\r\nis  consistent  with  legitimate  purposes  and  with  annual\r\n\r\ndeclarations  made by a State Party.  A challenge  inspection\r\n\r\nis  carried out when a State Party to the Convention requests\r\n\r\nthe  Organisation to conduct an inspection in any other State\r\n\r\nParty  to  the  Convention.  A request may  be  made  if  the\r\n\r\nrequesting  State Party has good reason to suspect  that  the\r\n\r\nother  State Party has violated the Convention.  However,  to\r\n\r\nallay  any  concern  over the intrusive  nature  of  such  an\r\n\r\ninspection, the Bill provides that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan inspection may only be carried out with the consent of the\r\n\r\nperson  in  control of the premises or with a court  warrant.\r\n\r\nOther safeguards are set out in clause 24 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will have limited impact on the commercial\r\n\r\noperations  of  our  companies  in  the  chemical  and  other\r\n\r\nindustries.   In  fact, since 1997, they have  actually  been\r\n\r\nmaking   annual   declarations  to  the  National   Authority\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  and  have already factored the  making  of  such\r\n\r\ndeclarations  in  their  work  schedules.  From   information\r\n\r\nobtained  in  1999,  less  than  60  companies  will  require\r\n\r\nlicences for activities involving chemicals controlled by the\r\n\r\nConvention.  Of these, only eight will be subject to  routine\r\n\r\ninspections  by  the international organsiations  as  set  up\r\n\r\nunder  the  Convention.  Trial inspections here and elsewhere\r\n\r\nhave  shown that they cause only minimal disruptions  to  the\r\n\r\noperations of companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it is morally right for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  sign the Chemical Weapons Convention  on  14th\r\n\r\nJanuary  1993  and ratifying the Convention on  21st  October\r\n\r\n1995.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my sincere hope is that Singapore shall never\r\n\r\nsupport  any form of weapons of mass destruction in war  and,\r\n\r\nin  peacetime,  to prevent their proliferation,  manufacture,\r\n\r\nstockpiling  and  take  a stand for their  destruction.   All\r\n\r\nforms  of  mass  destruction, be it  nuclear,  biological  or\r\n\r\nchemical are inhuman.  When they are used, they destroy  both\r\n\r\ncombatants  and non-combatants.  In a war, when  conventional\r\n\r\nweapons  are used, it is the civilian population that  really\r\n\r\nsuffers  and when weapons of mass destruction are  used,  the\r\n\r\ncivilian population suffers even more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I visited Hiroshima in 1998 and I visited the\r\n\r\nmuseum  which  told the story of the dropping of  the  atomic\r\n\r\nbomb on that city.  All inhabitants of that city within\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrange of the bomb died. The atomic bomb, which is a weapon of\r\n\r\nmass  destruction, killed every one in its path. It  did  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  whether a person is a soldier,  a  woman  or  a\r\n\r\nchild.   It just simply wiped out every one.  In the case  of\r\n\r\nHiroshima,  the  inhabitants on 6th August  1945  suffered  a\r\n\r\nterrible death.  The inhabitants were seared by heat of  4000\r\n\r\ndegrees Celsius. Then there were strong winds of intense heat\r\n\r\nfollowed  by  acid rain. Finally, those who were still  alive\r\n\r\nsuffered radiation which destroyed their immune system.  Many\r\n\r\nlater died of leukemia and related diseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass destruction done by chemical weapons is equally\r\n\r\nbad.  The  difference  between chemical weapons  and  nuclear\r\n\r\nweapons is that the former destroy only living things.   They\r\n\r\ndo  not destroy physical properties, such as houses and other\r\n\r\nbuildings.   However, like all weapons of  mass  destruction,\r\n\r\nthey  still do not discriminate between soldiers who are  the\r\n\r\nactual combatants and the civilian population. When they  are\r\n\r\nused, they kill every one. Some chemical weapons are designed\r\n\r\nto  kill  plants such as the agent orange chemical  that  was\r\n\r\nused  in  Vietnam to destroy vast areas of foliage instantly.\r\n\r\nThe main use of the chemical agent orange was deployed mainly\r\n\r\nto  kill  plants and trees but it was also harmful  to  human\r\n\r\nbeings  who  came  in contact with it.   Those  who  came  in\r\n\r\ncontact  with that chemical later suffered from sickness  and\r\n\r\ndisabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is right that we should have this law to\r\n\r\nprohibit  chemical weapons in Singapore and  give  effect  to\r\n\r\nSingapore's obligation under the Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I have listened to Mr Chiam and I\r\n\r\nthank  him for his support.  I think Members would share  his\r\n\r\nviews  and  comments  on weapons of mass destruction,  and  I\r\n\r\nshould add to what I said in my speech that Singapore has  in\r\n\r\nfact   signed   all   the  key  treaties  and   international\r\n\r\nconventions   involving  weapons  of  mass  destruction.

At that time,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  was making the transition from a developing  economy\r\n\r\nto   a  more  advanced  developing  economy.   We  needed  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen our capabilities in undertaking higher value-added\r\n\r\nactivities,  and  invest in R&D to better  harness  the  full\r\n\r\npotential  of  latest development in science and  technology.\r\n\r\nWe  therefore upgraded and expanded the Science Council  into\r\n\r\nthe  NSTB to nurture manpower development, and encourage  R&D\r\n\r\nin the public and private sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 10 years have gone by. Gross expenditure in R&D\r\n\r\nhas  increased  from 0.84% of GDP in 1990 to 1.78%  in  1998.\r\n\r\nThe  number  of research and scientific engineers  (RSE)  has\r\n\r\ntripled from about 4,300 to 12,600 over the same period.  The\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  now  accounts for  more  than  60%  of  R&D,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  only  54% in 1990.  The NSTB  has  also  helped\r\n\r\nestablish a technology infrastructure comprising 13  research\r\n\r\ninstitutes and centres\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  support R&D in the industry.  On the whole, we have  made\r\n\r\ngood  progress  in enhancing our capabilities  in  technology\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead to the next 10 years, our new challenge is\r\n\r\nto  transform  the  Singapore economy into a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.  We recognise that innovation and speed are the  two\r\n\r\nkey  attributes for success in the New Economy.  We therefore\r\n\r\nneed  to continue to strengthen not only our capabilities  in\r\n\r\nup-stream  technology development, but also our  capabilities\r\n\r\nin mid-stream innovation; and down-stream commercialisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, we also need to strengthen the link\r\n\r\namong    these    up-stream,   mid-stream   and   down-stream\r\n\r\ncapabilities,  so  that we can speedily turn  creative  ideas\r\n\r\ninto  marketable products and services to enjoy first mover's\r\n\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business communities will need to reinvent their\r\n\r\nbusinesses to seize the huge opportunities presented by these\r\n\r\nrapid  changes.  Likewise, NSTB and all our economic agencies\r\n\r\nwill  have to rapidly evolve in response to the emergence  of\r\n\r\nthe New Economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of the proposed amendments to the NSTB\r\n\r\nAct  is  to enable the NSTB to respond to the New Economy  by\r\n\r\nexpanding  its  role.   The  expanded  role  encompasses  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of an environment conducive not only for  science\r\n\r\nand  technology  development, but also  for  innovation  with\r\n\r\nscience  and technology, and commercial deployment of science\r\n\r\nand technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now run through the proposed amendments. In\r\n\r\nclause  2,  we  have inserted the definitions of  \"commercial\r\n\r\napplication\" and \"financial assistance\".  This  is  to  state\r\n\r\nclearly  the  proposed  expansion  in  the  scope  of  NSTB's\r\n\r\nfunctions  beyond  science  and  technology  development   to\r\n\r\ninclude innovation and commercialisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill and the amended First Schedule will\r\n\r\nallow the Minister to appoint up to two members of the NSTB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBoard  to  be  Deputy Chairmen instead  of  one.   This  will\r\n\r\nprovide  greater management flexibility to NSTB,  bearing  in\r\n\r\nmind its expanded scope of functions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen the link between up-stream R&D with mid-stream innovation and down-stream commercialisation, we will\r\n\r\nexpand  NSTB's functions to include development and promotion\r\n\r\nof  technopreneurship  in Singapore.  This  is  reflected  in\r\n\r\nclause 4 of the Bill.   This will empower the Board:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to create a pro-enterprise, pro-discovery and pro-innovation environment;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to promote pervasive development and exploitation of\r\n\r\nscience and  technology knowledge in commercial applications;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to encourage more collaborations in the education and\r\n\r\nresearch  communities,  as well as  between  the  public  and\r\n\r\nprivate sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will also step up its activities in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and attraction of local and foreign science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology   and  technopreneurial  talents,  investors   and\r\n\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill empowers NSTB to embark on a wider\r\n\r\nrange   of  developmental  activities.   This  includes   the\r\n\r\ngranting   of   financial  assistance  to   individuals   and\r\n\r\nenterprises for manpower development, technology development,\r\n\r\ninnovation and commercialisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also includes the provision of incubator and business\r\n\r\nsupport  facilities, as well as the development of properties\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  proposed Science Hub for  the  development  of\r\n\r\nscience and technology, innovation and technopreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also provides for partnership with the private sector\r\n\r\nto  offer incubator and business support facilities  for  new\r\n\r\nand growing technology-based start-ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, NSTB has done a good job in building\r\n\r\nour capability in science and technology.  In our next stage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  economic  development, we need to build and  exploit  our\r\n\r\nscience  and  technology  capability  speedily,  and  to  the\r\n\r\nfullest potential for maximum commercial returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments would empower the NSTB to\r\n\r\nperform  an  expanded role in the development of science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology,  innovation  with  science  and  technology,  and\r\n\r\ncommercialisation of science and technology,  as  we  venture\r\n\r\ninto the era of the knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin joining this debate on the National Science and Technology\r\n\r\nBoard  (Amendment) Bill, I wish to raise two issues so as  to\r\n\r\nseek further information from the Acting Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I wish to ask the Acting Minister what are the\r\n\r\nfuture plans of the Government and the role of the NSTB  with\r\n\r\nrespect  to the Technopreneurship 21 plan.  In particular,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  as reported in the press covering a speech  made\r\n\r\nby the Deputy Prime Minister Dr Tony Tan, he said that the $1\r\n\r\nbillion  technopreneurship fund would be  fully  invested  by\r\n\r\nabout the middle of this year, which is quite soon.  Hence, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to know what are the Government's intentions  to\r\n\r\nprovide  additional funding of this programme,  and  how  the\r\n\r\nNSTB would be involved in actively pursuing the objectives of\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship 21.  I also like to urge  the NSTB to  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with  the  private sector in  its  future  plans  in\r\n\r\npromoting entrepreneurship and technopreneurship development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second query relates to clause 5 of this Bill.\r\n\r\nIt  says  that the amendment Bill would expand the powers  of\r\n\r\nthe  NSTB  in order for it to discharge additional functions.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  NSTB  would have powers to provide or  develop,  in\r\n\r\npartnership  with  the  private sector,  programmes  such  as\r\n\r\nincubator centres and other business support facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here, I would like to declare that I am a director\r\n\r\nof  a  company  involved in incubator  centre  facilities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   However,  my view is that  we  should  encourage\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship, there should be more competition and  more\r\n\r\nincubator centres and more of such support facilities  to  be\r\n\r\nestablished   in  Singapore.   Only  by  having   more   such\r\n\r\nfacilities can we then be able to build up a critical mass of\r\n\r\nyoung entrepreneurs among our Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the experience of other countries such as in the\r\n\r\nUS, incubator centres have been set up by the private sector.\r\n\r\nIn  the  US, they call them by various names like hatcheries,\r\n\r\ngarages or even accelerator programmes.  These are all  based\r\n\r\non  the same concept, which is to help start-up companies  to\r\n\r\nbe  formed  and enable them to grow quickly from  a  start-up\r\n\r\nstage to a mature stage.  Even in Malaysia, I understand that\r\n\r\nthey have the Multi-Media Super Corridor.  They have provided\r\n\r\na  very  huge  area  to provide for a very massive  incubator\r\n\r\ncentre,  so  as  to  encourage Malaysians to  get  into  this\r\n\r\nincubator centre concept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what are NSTB's\r\n\r\nplans   to   support  or  develop  incubator  facilities   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  what  are  the programmes  of  the  NSTB  to\r\n\r\ncollaborate with the private sector to create more  incubator\r\n\r\ncentres.   Also, will the Government consider giving  special\r\n\r\nincentives  or  encouragement so that the NSTB together  with\r\n\r\nprivate  enterprise  can  set up more  incubator  centres  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in future?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to make some general comments on the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members of the House have recently given many\r\n\r\nexcellent suggestions on how we could effectively participate\r\n\r\nin  the new economy that will be mainly driven by information\r\n\r\nand  the  technology sectors of our industries.  It is  quite\r\n\r\nobvious  that  more  can  be done  in  creating  a  conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment that can nurture entrepreneurs as well as many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  new start-up companies, and also in supporting the many\r\n\r\nnew  small  companies in Singapore to be  groomed  to  become\r\n\r\nworld-class companies in the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore timely that an agency be given the task\r\n\r\nto  focus  on  doing  the things I just  mentioned,  and  the\r\n\r\nNational  Science and Technology Board is the best agency  to\r\n\r\nassume this role.  I must say that in the past few years, the\r\n\r\nNSTB  has  played  a  proactive role  in  trying  to  promote\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship  and  in  encouraging  the  development  of\r\n\r\ntechnological activities, and we have been very successful in\r\n\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the functions and powers of the Board\r\n\r\nis   therefore   an  excellent  measure  for  promoting   and\r\n\r\nsupporting  technopreneurship and to  organise  Singapore  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  the centre of technological development  in\r\n\r\nthis  region.  Increasingly, I feel that the role of NSTB  is\r\n\r\nbeing  divided  into  two  parts.   The  first  role  is   of\r\n\r\ninitiating and promoting longer term development efforts, the\r\n\r\nresults of which may not be so obvious in the short term, and\r\n\r\nwhich  will  involve  huge investments  that  may  not  yield\r\n\r\nfinancial returns for the Board or for the Government in  the\r\n\r\nshort  term  or  in  the  long term.   But  these  are  still\r\n\r\nnecessary so that we could steer the country and the  private\r\n\r\nsector to the desired directions, the results of which  would\r\n\r\ncreate the future industries and therefore the wealth for the\r\n\r\ncountry, and also future jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second role is one that can have an immediate or\r\n\r\nshort  term  impact and which could also result in  financial\r\n\r\ngains for the Board.  The amendments in clause 5 of the  Bill\r\n\r\nbasically reflect this role.  In this role, the NSTB acts  as\r\n\r\nan  incubator  and  as an angel investor,  or  as  a  venture\r\n\r\ncapitalist which can help stimulate many new start-ups to set\r\n\r\nup shop in Singapore.  With its infrastructure, the Board can\r\n\r\nalso help start-up companies with a network of companies that\r\n\r\nit is incubating and with the connections that the Board has,\r\n\r\nand this will help them basically progress in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsetting up their companies and in progressing further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of being an incubator and an investor is also a\r\n\r\nuseful role in creating a dynamic environment where many  new\r\n\r\ncompanies   can   thrive  and  grow  to  become   world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies.   In this capacity, the Board should not  restrict\r\n\r\nitself  to the local market, but rather it should participate\r\n\r\nas  a global player entering into the best technology centres\r\n\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, it would be wise to at least have a\r\n\r\nseparate organisational structure for each of these two roles\r\n\r\nthat  I have mentioned.  In fact, in order not to lose focus,\r\n\r\nit  may  be  a  good idea to have separate agencies  handling\r\n\r\nthese  two roles, with the possibility of the second role  or\r\n\r\nfunction being privatised in the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other suggestion I have is for the Board to be\r\n\r\nresponsible for supporting and growing the smaller  companies\r\n\r\nfrom  the  point of them being in the start-up stage  to  the\r\n\r\npoint  when  they  become world-class companies.   Currently,\r\n\r\nboth the Economic Development Board and the Productivity  and\r\n\r\nStandards Board have a bigger role to play in supporting such\r\n\r\ncompanies.   In  my  opinion, the  NSTB  could  play  a  more\r\n\r\neffective  role  than  both of these  agencies  that  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned,  especially for the technology-type of  companies,\r\n\r\nif  we  are  serious  about growing  many  more  world  class\r\n\r\ncompanies in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is also being amended to allow for the\r\n\r\nappointment of two Deputy Chairmen.  I would like to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  one  of  the Deputy Chairmen's position  be  filled  by\r\n\r\nsomeone who is still in the private sector to complement  the\r\n\r\nstrength of the existing members of the Board.  In this  way,\r\n\r\nindustry  perspective  and  current  trends  will  always  be\r\n\r\navailable  and will be useful in the decisions of the  Board.\r\n\r\nThe  Vice-Chairman should also have executive  functions  for\r\n\r\ngreater ownership and effectiveness in executing his  or  her\r\n\r\nrole.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes proposed in this Bill, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nare  good and I hope that the Minister of State will consider\r\n\r\nthe suggestions that I have made in executing the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nthe two Members for speaking up in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee asked whether the Government would\r\n\r\ninject  additional funding for T21 beyond  the  US$1  billion\r\n\r\nTIF.   Since  the  launch of the US$1 billion  TIF,  we  have\r\n\r\ninvested in 24 funds amounting to about $620 million.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult of the TIF as well as the efforts by the EDB and  NSTB\r\n\r\nin promoting venture capital in Singapore, in fact, today the\r\n\r\ntotal pool of venture fund managed out of Singapore has grown\r\n\r\nto  about  $10.2 billion.  So the total fund size is actually\r\n\r\nquite  large  and is still growing.  The NSTB  right  now  is\r\n\r\nstudying whether there is a need for the Government to inject\r\n\r\nadditional  funding  into  the  venture  market.    We   will\r\n\r\ncertainly  do  so  if there is a need for the  Government  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  play this role of risk sharing by  co-investing\r\n\r\nwith  the  industry.  Certainly, if we were  to  inject  more\r\n\r\nfunds,  the  intention  is  to work  very  closely  with  the\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked whether NSTB and the Government\r\n\r\nwould  do  more  to promote the creation of  more  incubation\r\n\r\ncentres  to  create more competition in the market  place  in\r\n\r\norder to create the critical mass of technological start-ups.\r\n\r\nWe agree with Mr Leong's assessment.  It is important that we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  encourage more start-ups and at the  same  time\r\n\r\ncreate  more incubation facilities for the start-ups so  that\r\n\r\nthey could go into operation as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the NSTB started the incubation centre programme\r\n\r\nabout five years ago, I am happy to report to this House that\r\n\r\nat  this  moment we are seeing at least 20 incubation centres\r\n\r\nbeing  set  up  by  the private sector.  What  is  even  more\r\n\r\nexciting   is   that  some  of  these  private  sector-driven\r\n\r\nincubation centres even offer equities in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlieu  of  rent so as to reduce the cash flow demand on  these\r\n\r\nstart-ups.   Looking to the future, the NSTB does  intend  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to work very closely with the private sector.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  NSTB will continue to refer new start-ups and  deal\r\n\r\nflow  that we come across to these incubation centres.   Some\r\n\r\nof  these  incubation centre management companies do  set  up\r\n\r\nincubation venture funds to invest in the start-up.  If  need\r\n\r\nbe,  the  NSTB  is prepared to co-invest with them  to  share\r\n\r\ntheir risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe Mr Inderjit Singh brought up\r\n\r\nthree  points.  First, he divided the role of NSTB  into  two\r\n\r\nparts - long term development to create future industries and\r\n\r\nshort-term  impact to stimulate new start-ups.  He  suggested\r\n\r\nthat we have two separate agencies to handle these two roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the two roles are inter-related. After\r\n\r\nall,  the  long term is made up of a series of  short  terms.\r\n\r\nWhat is long term today will become short-term in five to  10\r\n\r\nyears from now.  Our key challenge is really to find ways  to\r\n\r\nbetter align our efforts for long term development and  short\r\n\r\nterm impact so as to maximise the benefits we can derive from\r\n\r\nour  investment in these long term and short term development\r\n\r\nefforts.   In  fact, this is the main motivation  behind  the\r\n\r\nproposed amendments to ensure that we will be able to  derive\r\n\r\nmaximum  synergies from science and technological development\r\n\r\nand  technopreneurship development.  It will therefore  still\r\n\r\nbe  useful,  at  least for the time being, for  the  NSTB  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  perform both roles, of long  term  science  and\r\n\r\ntechnology   development  and  short  term  technopreneurship\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   However, I would like to  assure  Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh that in performing these two roles, the NSTB will  work\r\n\r\nvery  closely  with the industry, the research  community  as\r\n\r\nwell as the private sector because, at the end of the day, we\r\n\r\nrecognise  that the private sector is really  the  engine  of\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that the NSTB be responsible\r\n\r\nfor supporting and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrowing  companies  from  start-up  through  to  world  class\r\n\r\ncorporations.  I think companies at different stages of their\r\n\r\ndevelopment  do face different challenges.  Over  the  years,\r\n\r\nvarious  economic agencies such as, the EDB, NSTB,  PSB,  TDB\r\n\r\nand  so  on,  have built up their areas of core  competencies\r\n\r\nthat  can complement and supplement each other.  We feel that\r\n\r\nit  would be useful to continue to let each of these agencies\r\n\r\nplay  its role.  What we will do is to continue to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  coordination across these agencies so that  collectively\r\n\r\nthey will be able to provide a better level of support to our\r\n\r\nstart-ups as they grow into major corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested that one of the\r\n\r\npositions of the Deputy Chairmen be filled by someone who  is\r\n\r\nstill in the private sector.  The NSTB believes in drawing on\r\n\r\nthe expertise of the private sector.  In fact, on the present\r\n\r\nboard of 12 members, six of them are from the private sector.\r\n\r\nWith these proposed amendments, the Minister will now be able\r\n\r\nto appoint not more than two board members to the position of\r\n\r\nDeputy  Chairman.  In that sense, the private sector  members\r\n\r\nof  the  board likewise can be appointed to the  position  of\r\n\r\nDeputy  Chairman.  The Minister will certainly  consider  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion put up by Mr Inderjit Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Lim Swee Say].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\"\r\n\r\n- [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Nine minutes past Two o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Prime Minister if he\r\n\r\nwill  (i)  give  an  assessment of his recent  visit  to  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Republic of China from the economic point of  view,\r\n\r\nand  (ii)  inform the House what business opportunities  have\r\n\r\nbeen identified or made available for our business community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic assessment</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My recent visit to China has re-affirmed my bullish\r\n\r\nassessment of  its growth prospects.  It is a large market of\r\n\r\n1.2   billion   consumers   and  an   attractive   investment\r\n\r\ndestination.   It  can be a strong economic partner,  if  our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen can grasp the opportunities it offers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, like all emerging economies, there are some\r\n\r\nareas  of concern that bear watching.  For instance,  China's\r\n\r\ntraditional  industries  are  still  suffering   from   over-capacity.  Domestic  demand  remains  sluggish  although  the\r\n\r\ngovernment is trying to encourage greater spending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I am confident that the Chinese government\r\n\r\nremains  committed to the path of economic  reforms,  and  is\r\n\r\nprepared  for  the  full introduction of foreign  competition\r\n\r\nupon WTO membership.   China's impending accession to the WTO\r\n\r\nwill  keep  up the pressure to speed up reforms in its  State\r\n\r\nOwned Enterprises (SOEs) and financial sector in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One strong impression I had from this trip is that while\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese government is vigorously pushing ahead with  its\r\n\r\neconomic  reforms, it is at the same time busy preparing  for\r\n\r\nthe  New  Economy.   During  our visits  to  Zhongguancun  in\r\n\r\nBeijing and the Xi'an Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone, we\r\n\r\nsaw   that   the  Chinese  government  had  begun  to   build\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, including info-communications infrastructure,\r\n\r\nand  to  enhance institutional capacities such as in research\r\n\r\nand development, with a view to riding on the New Economy for\r\n\r\nsustainable long-term growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue of particular concern to the Chinese\r\n\r\nleadership  was the outflow of Chinese talent.   Premier  Zhu\r\n\r\nRongji told me that China was losing about 70 to 80 per  cent\r\n\r\nof its graduates from top Chinese universities, mainly to the\r\n\r\nUS.     Beijing's  Tsinghua  University  has  10,000  of  its\r\n\r\ngraduates  working  in  Silicon  Valley.   Xi'an's   Jiaotong\r\n\r\nUniversity lamented that two thirds of its graduates did  not\r\n\r\nstay  in  Shanxi  Province  after graduation.   The  Shanghai\r\n\r\nleadership is aggressively attracting talents to help convert\r\n\r\nopportunities  offered by the Internet revolution  and  other\r\n\r\ngrowth  sectors  such  as  life  sciences  to  real  business\r\n\r\nactivities.  For  example, they are offering  scientists  and\r\r\n\r\nprofessors  from  Beijing  double the  salary  and  rent-free\r\n\r\naccommodation  plus  flexible employment  terms  to  work  in\r\n\r\nShanghai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why when I suggested that Asian countries should\r\n\r\ncollaborate to forge a \"Silicon Valley of the mind\" to retain\r\n\r\nAsian talents in Asia, it met with an immediate and receptive\r\n\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Business Opportunities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As China continues to develop and open up, there will be\r\n\r\nmany  new  opportunities  for our businessmen.   The  Chinese\r\n\r\ngovernment  is now giving greater emphasis to the development\r\n\r\nof  the inland provinces. The inland provinces are many years\r\n\r\nbehind the coastal region.  Their opening up will create even\r\n\r\nmore  investment  and trade opportunities. I understand  that\r\n\r\nthe  business  delegation which accompanied me to  China  had\r\n\r\nidentified  37  business opportunities  while  in  Xi'an  for\r\n\r\nfurther consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to the private sector to assess and decide on\r\n\r\nthe  type  of  investments to be made.  The government  will,\r\n\r\nhowever,  help  to  facilitate  their  efforts  through   our\r\n\r\neconomic  agencies.    For  example,  the  Singapore-Shandong\r\n\r\nBusiness  Council,  established  in  1993,  has  successfully\r\n\r\ninitiated  12 areas of cooperation such as manpower training,\r\n\r\nfinance  and  banking,  enterprise  development,  hospitality\r\n\r\nservices  and  information exchange.  Our economic  agencies,\r\n\r\nuniversities  and research institutes will also  continue  to\r\n\r\nwork with their Chinese counterparts to enhance exchanges  in\r\n\r\nmutually  beneficial areas such as IT and telecommunications,\r\n\r\ntourism, R&D and financial services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MEDISHIELD</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are any plans to ensure that MediShield  will\r\n\r\nremain  affordable and effective such that  the  coverage  is\r\n\r\nadequate and the premium deductible will not rise unduly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MediShield is an insurance scheme. Just like other\r\n\r\nhealth insurance schemes, the premiums will be higher if  the\r\n\r\nco-payment is low, or if more disease conditions are  covered\r\n\r\nby  the scheme.  We are fortunate that since its introduction\r\n\r\nin  1990,  we  have  been able to keep the premiums  low  and\r\n\r\naffordable  and expand MediShield coverage to new  treatments\r\n\r\nand drugs, without increasing the premiums or co-payment.  To\r\n\r\ngive  just two examples, we have recently extended MediShield\r\n\r\nreimbursement to stereotactic radiotherapy for the  treatment\r\n\r\nof  brain tumour, and Prograf, an immunosuppressant drug used\r\n\r\nin  organ  transplants.  So, MediShield has delivered  better\r\n\r\nand better value for money to patients over the years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot take this for granted. The best way\r\n\r\nto  keep  MediShield  premiums as well as patient  co-payment\r\n\r\naffordable to Singaporeans, without compromising its coverage\r\n\r\nof  a  wide range of disease conditions, is by ensuring  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans remain healthy and when they do require  medical\r\n\r\ncare, the cost increases are moderated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is already heavily subsidising health\r\n\r\ncare  in Singapore. Acute hospital care is subsidised at 80%,\r\n\r\n65%,  50%,  and 20% for Class C, B2, B2+ and B1 respectively.\r\n\r\nPolyclinics are subsidised at 50%.  The measures  to  contain\r\n\r\nhealth   care  costs  must  be  complemented  by   individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  Our  best insurance for  the  future  is  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  encourage  all  Singaporeans  to  lead  healthy\r\n\r\nlifestyles. If they fall ill and have to be warded, they must\r\n\r\nchoose  their wards prudently based on their financial means.\r\n\r\nFor  those who cannot afford to pay even the subsidised rates\r\n\r\ndue  to  financial hardship, Medifund acts as a final  safety\r\n\r\nnet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SAFE AND HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhether  existing  office workplaces are generally  safe  and\r\n\r\nwhat  steps  his Ministry is taking to ensure that  our  work\r\n\r\nenvironment  will be highly favourable and on  par  with  OHS\r\n\r\nstandards of developed countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office environment in Singapore is generally safe.

Voltage dips\r\n\r\noccur  in all electric power systems and are caused  by  many\r\n\r\nreasons  such as cable damage by excavation works and  ground\r\n\r\nmovements; equipment failure at customers' installations; and\r\n\r\nequipment failure at power stations and the transmission  and\r\n\r\ndistribution  network.   Voltage  dips  cannot   be   totally\r\n\r\neliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voltage dip on 24th March 2000 was caused by the\r\n\r\nfailure  of  a voltage measuring transformer in  the  230  kV\r\n\r\nswitchgear   at  Pulau  Seraya  Power  Station.  The   faulty\r\n\r\nequipment caused a short circuit which resulted in a  voltage\r\n\r\ndip.  The short circuit was detected and the faulty equipment\r\n\r\nwas  immediately  isolated  by its  protection  system.   The\r\n\r\ndefective component has since been replaced and it  has  been\r\n\r\nsent back to the original equipment manufacturer in Japan for\r\n\r\nfurther investigation to determine the reason for failure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disruptions caused by voltage dips vary from one\r\n\r\ncustomer  to  another depending on the sensitivity  of  their\r\n\r\nequipment   and  the  protective  devices  which  they   have\r\n\r\ninstalled  to help their equipment ride through such  voltage\r\n\r\ndips.   It is hence difficult to estimate losses suffered  by\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Since many of our companies now manufacture  high\r\n\r\nvalue  products  such  as  semiconductors,  power  dips   are\r\n\r\ntherefore a serious concern for many of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation payments will arise if there is a contract\r\n\r\nbetween  a  customer and its utilities supplier  based  on  a\r\n\r\nmutually  agreed  set  of  power quality  standards  and  the\r\n\r\ncompensation where there is failure to meet these standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we do not have a generally accepted standard\r\n\r\nfor power quality with respect to power dips although we have\r\n\r\nstandards  for power outages.  However, in view of  the  need\r\n\r\nfor  very high quality power by our high-tech industries  for\r\n\r\ntheir sensitive equipment, PUB is currently working with  the\r\n\r\nindustry  to establish power quality standards for compliance\r\n\r\nby utilities companies.  This will provide clearer guidelines\r\n\r\non the quality of the power supply expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are also undertaking measures to provide\r\n\r\nan  even  higher  quality of power  supply.   Last  year,  we\r\n\r\namended  the Public Utilities Act to impose heavier penalties\r\n\r\non  earthworks contractors who damage power cables.  This has\r\n\r\nhelped reduce the number of voltage dips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as part of the restructuring of the\r\n\r\nelectricity  industry  which  the  Minister  for  Trade   and\r\n\r\nIndustry  announced last month in this House, PUB  will  also\r\n\r\nimplement  performance-based regulation  for  PowerGrid,  the\r\n\r\ntransmission and distribution company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a liberalised electricity market, we can expect to\r\n\r\nsee   a  variety  of  service  providers  provide  customised\r\n\r\nsolutions  to meet the specific needs of high-tech customers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to help existing high-tech companies in Singapore,\r\n\r\nPUB  is  working  with the EDB and PowerGrid to  implement  a\r\n\r\nscheme  to  provide premium quality power.

This  is\r\n\r\nintended  to encourage commuters to use our public  transport\r\n\r\nsystem.  Through  these projects, LTA  has  demonstrated  the\r\n\r\nattractiveness of such an infrastructure provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA will continue to focus on providing sheltered\r\n\r\nwalkways  at  the  major  transport  nodes,  namely   MRT/LRT\r\n\r\nstations  and  bus  interchanges.  For  this  financial  year\r\n\r\n(FY2000),  it  will  be spending about $6  million  on  these\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Councils will continue with their efforts to build\r\n\r\nmore  sheltered  walkways  in  the  residential  estates.

The  roads on  Jurong  Island  will  be\r\n\r\ndeclared  as  public streets when the Jurong Town Corporation\r\n\r\ncompletes all the road works and hands over management of the\r\n\r\nroads to the Land Transport Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the causeway was constructed in April 1999,\r\n\r\nworkers  had to travel to Jurong Pier, board a ferry  to  the\r\n\r\nisland,  and  then  take  a shuttle bus  within  the  island.\r\n\r\nFerries  and shuttle buses were provided by employers.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  completion of the causeway, JTC has been providing a bus\r\n\r\nservice between Jurong East Interchange and the island.  This\r\n\r\nis  a public bus service for Jurong Island workers as well as\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus service is heavily subsidised by JTC. This is\r\n\r\nbecause  Jurong Island is a huge sprawling industrial  estate\r\n\r\nwith  very  low ridership density. To compare, the island  is\r\n\r\nabout  two  times the size of Ang Mo Kio town, but the  daily\r\n\r\nbus  ridership is only about 1.5% of the ridership in Ang  Mo\r\n\r\nKio.  The  island  serves  mainly workers  which  means  that\r\n\r\ntransport demand is very peakish. It is difficult for any bus\r\n\r\noperator to run a viable bus service on the island unless the\r\n\r\ncorrect level of fares is charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council has called for a tender to\r\n\r\noperate a public bus service on the island after the contract\r\n\r\nwith the current bus operator ends. This will ensure that the\r\n\r\noperator  that  wins the tender offers the  most  competitive\r\n\r\nfares  and  gives the best value for money. Tender  proposals\r\n\r\nare  being  evaluated and will be awarded by early May  2000.\r\n\r\nThe new operator will start operations from 1st June 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC has been in contact with employers on Jurong Island\r\n\r\nto  brief  them  on  developments.  I  understand  that  many\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  prepared  to provide transport  allowance  to\r\n\r\ntheir  staff to make it more attractive for them to  work  on\r\n\r\nJurong  Island.  This  is a common practice  for  workers  in\r\n\r\nremote  locations, and I encourage employers and  workers  to\r\n\r\nwork together for a mutually beneficial solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TAXIS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Information Technology how many taxis were\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  securing COEs each month  from  May  1999  to\r\n\r\nFebruary 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi companies are required to bid for COEs only for the\r\n\r\nregistration of new taxis which are additions to their fleet.\r\n\r\nFor  replacement  taxis,  ie, taxis that  are  registered  to\r\n\r\nreplace  those  that have been de-registered, they  are  only\r\n\r\nrequired  to  pay Category A Prevailing Quota Premium  (PQP).\r\n\r\nThis  is a concession given to taxis in view of their  public\r\n\r\ntransport role.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period between May 1999 to February 2000, a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  160  new taxis were registered.

More importantly, MCDS will help  family\r\n\r\nmembers  to  develop life-skills to care for  themselves  and\r\n\r\ntheir  children and educate them on the steps that they could\r\n\r\ntake  if  their  spouse  refuses to seek  treatment  for  the\r\n\r\ndrinking problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The  appropriateness for MCDS to set up Alcoholics  Anonymous for  Women and to fund the setting up of half-way houses  for women under the influence of multiple substance abuse</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As WH already has in place an existing framework for the\r\n\r\nintervention  and  treatment for  recovering  alcoholics  and\r\n\r\ntheir  families,  MCDS  would not  want  to  duplicate  this.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are two half-way houses for women under  MHA.\r\n\r\nOne  of  them  has  a specific programme to  help  recovering\r\n\r\naddicts  cope   with their drinking problem.   This  half-way\r\n\r\nhouse is also open to members of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will continue to monitor the extent of\r\n\r\nalcohol consumption among young women and men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000425/20000425-HA-0720077.htm\">comparison - COMPARISON OF HYDE PARK'S SPEAKERS' CORNER AND SINGAPORE'S SPEAKERS' CORNER AT HONG LIM PARK (Cols. 77-80)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000425/20000425-HA-0720081.gif\">map - SPEAKERS' CORNER AT HONG LIM PARK (Cols. 81-82)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
