FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;business costs have indeed gone up.&nbsp; Rental and manpower costs have&nbsp;risen.&nbsp; Global commodity prices remain high compared to their level&nbsp;a year ago, and this has been reflected in higher fuel and <p align=left>Column: 9<p>materials costs for our SMEs.&nbsp; &nbsp; But this is not unique to Singapore.&nbsp; SMEs in other countries are similarly affected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feedback we have received from SMEs indicate that higher costs have squeezed their profit margins. But they remain financially sound.&nbsp; Loan default rates&nbsp; and rental arrears are stable. Industry feedback is that SMEs&rsquo; business expectations for the next six months are still moderately positive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our SMEs have highlighted that manpower, raw materials and rental are the key components contributing to the rising business costs. With the continued rise in global commodity costs, it is unlikely that the price pressure on raw materials will ease significantly.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we have&nbsp;put in place several measures in areas within our control to address manpower and rental costs, so as to help SMEs meet the challenges as well as tap opportunities of the current economic environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we have sought to lower business costs by easing manpower constraints through various avenues.&nbsp; Working with MOM and WDA, we have reached out to economically inactive residents (housewives and mature workers) to encourage them to join the workforce. We have also provided greater flexibility in our foreign worker policy since January 2008. As a result, while we have been seeing some increase in labour costs in the recent months, this is still at a reasonable level compared to labour costs in previous years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also sought to ease rental rates. Part of the current rental escalation could be attributed to the spillover effects from the short-term office crunch. To mitigate this, the Government has released more transitional sites and vacant State properties for office use, which will come on-stream in about a year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 10<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Government has also similarly increased space available for industrial and retail developments, which have also led to a moderation in the industrial and retail rental growth rates. By next year, there would be more forward supply which will gradually be realised over the next few years to ease demand. Nonetheless, we are already seeing a moderation in industrial rental growth rates. For the second quarter this year, industrial rental growth was at about 2.3%, down from about 7.8% in fourth quarter 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also ensure that SMEs continue to have access to credit through our Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS), Loan Insurance Scheme (LIS) and Microloan Programmes. With these available loans, our SMEs will be able to continue financing their current operations while investing in capabilities to fuel future growth. Based on our monitoring of these loans and feedback from private financial institutions, there does not appear to be much credit tightening for SMEs. For instance, the amount of outstanding LEFS and LIS loans to SMEs for the first seven months of 2008 has grown by more than 50% over the same period last year. The percentage of SME defaults on bank loans has also remained stable. We are monitoring these trends carefully and will increase Government loans to SMEs if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These challenging economic times also provide new opportunities for SMEs to grow. IE Singapore has stepped up its efforts to support SMEs expanding into emerging markets such as Latin America, Middle East, Russia and Vietnam, which still present opportunities despite the current global slowdown. For example, SMEs can now tap on IE&rsquo;s new Exporters Development Programme, which develops our SMEs&rsquo; skills and knowledge in export activities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 11<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain industry sectors also continue to see sustained growth despite uncertainty in markets and high business costs. The overall services sector, for example, which comprise largely SMEs, grew by a healthy 7% in the second quarter of 2008. In particular, sectors such as medical technologies, oil and gas, environment and renewable energy, healthcare and wellness, education and lifestyle products and services are expected to demonstrate good growth, going forward. We will support the development of these industries as well as the development of capabilities of SMEs in these areas. Such investments will ensure that our companies continue to retain their competitive edge during this period of economic uncertainty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:TOURISM SECTOR--><!--END_COL_TITLE:TOURISM SECTOR:::15--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Visitor arrivals registered the first decline in June after 51 months of uninterrupted growth since February 2004 and fell by about 3.8% year-on-year in July.&nbsp; Visitor arrivals in Singapore have <p align=left>Column: 12<p>slowed in line with the slowdown in the global travel industry, arising from the weaker external macro-economic environment and rising fuel prices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In the immediate term, STB will be working closely with industry partners to target key source markets using marketing initiatives such as the Uniquely Singapore Weekends campaign, which has been successful in drawing in visitors since its launch in August 2007.&nbsp; STB will also leverage on upcoming signature events, such as the inaugural Formula One race and the Singapore GP Season in September, as well as the year-end holiday season, to boost visitor arrivals and tourism spending.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent slowing of&nbsp; tourist arrivals to Singapore is also experienced by other regional economies.&nbsp; Singapore received about 5.1 million visitor arrivals in the first half of this year, registering a 2.9% growth when compared to the same period last year.&nbsp; This was on par with Malaysia&rsquo;s visitor growth rate of 2.6% and better than the 0.5% contraction in Australia, though slower than Hong Kong&rsquo;s 9% and Macau&rsquo;s 18%.&nbsp; Hong Kong and Macau have registered strong growth, as they continue to benefit from rising tourism traffic from China.&nbsp; In Macau&rsquo;s case, the opening of new casino resorts has also helped.&nbsp; However, the growth momentum of visitor arrivals has slowed down in both cases.&nbsp; Mr Banerjee has also asked about Bangkok.&nbsp; There are no city-specific data for Bangkok and Thailand has&nbsp;not released their first-half numbers for OATF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Notwithstanding the slowing growth, Singapore remains a choice venue amongst business travellers.&nbsp; In the recently-released annual ranking by the International Congress and Conventions Association (ICCA), Singapore was again found to have hosted the third highest number of international meetings in 2007 &ndash; ahead of regional and international <p align=left>Column: 13<p>business capitals like Beijing, Hong Kong, Brussels, London and Paris.&nbsp; In fact, Singapore has remained within the top three positions in the city rankings in the past three years (from 2005 to 2007) with an average of about 120 meetings per year.&nbsp; Singapore has also consistently performed well&nbsp;under the Union of International Associations (UIA) rankings for international meetings.&nbsp; Singapore emerged as the top international meeting city in 2007 ahead of perennial favourites like Paris and Vienna&nbsp;&ndash; an improvement over our third place position in the 2006 ranking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Banerjee also asked about the impact of high hotel occupancy and rising hotel room rates on tourists and business events in Singapore.&nbsp; While we recognise that rising room rates may affect visitor arrivals to some extent, Singapore remains a competitive travel destination.&nbsp; Our average room rate of about S$250 in the first half of the year is comparable to Hong Kong and Tokyo, whilst still about 20%-30% lower than New York and London.&nbsp; At 82% to 84%, the average occupancy rate for Singapore hotels is also comparable with the average rate of other global cities and remains within the level for optimal service delivery for the industry.&nbsp; Hotel room supply is estimated to increase by 12,000 rooms over the next three to four years, and STB will continue to work closely with other Government agencies to ensure that hotel capacity does not constrain future tourism growth.&nbsp; STB has also been working with various stakeholders to profile the career opportunities in the hotel industry as well as with the WDA to put in place the training programmes to ensure that there is sufficient manpower to meet future tourism demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;While there are challenging times ahead, the future outlook for the tourism sector remains positive.&nbsp; The diversity in Singapore&rsquo;s tourism source markets has helped to cushion the impact of a slowing <p align=left>Column: 14<p>global economy, with key source markets such as China, India and Australia continuing to demonstrate good growth in visitor arrivals.&nbsp; STB&rsquo;s efforts in developing emerging markets such as Vietnam, Russia and the United Arab Emirates have also paid off, with visitor arrivals from these regions registering strong double-digit growth in the first half of the year.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Besides the&nbsp;line-up of upcoming major events such as the Formula One race, the Volvo Ocean Race and the Youth Olympics Games, Singapore will be transformed with the completion of the two Integrated Resorts, Gardens by the Bay and the new International Cruise Terminal.&nbsp; All of these will add to the vibrancy of our city and allow Singapore to remain a compelling destination for different tourist segments.&nbsp;<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Banerjee's point is whether we need more three- and four-star hotel rooms.&nbsp; It is not for the Government to assess this as much as the market &ndash;&nbsp;between the travel industry players and the hoteliers, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, we have made a significant number of hotel sites available.&nbsp; In this case, in the second half of this <p align=left>Column: 15<p>year, there will be 13 Government Land Sales (GLS) sites with a capacity for more than 5,000 rooms &ndash;&nbsp;if I remember correctly&nbsp;&ndash; and these are available for different quality hotels.&nbsp; Mr Banerjee might also be aware that there is a significant development, in fact, in the three- and four-star segment of our hotel industry today in several locations.&nbsp; For example, in the Serangoon area, there have been major developments, because that is one area where a lot of the three- and four-star type of demand is concentrated.&nbsp; That remains a major possibility&nbsp;&ndash; what is already in the pipeline and through the GLS sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we also have some adaptive reuse kind of possibilities for disused Government buildings.&nbsp; Those are also available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, the supply is there and the potential supply availability can be boosted through this adaptive reuse and land sites.&nbsp; The important thing is for the market place to assess where these needs are and to respond to them.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM--><!--END_COL_TITLE:PUBLIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM:::20--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</B>&nbsp; Sir, since the completion of the Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) early this year, LTA has been rolling out various initiatives to improve the public transport system. I will briefly report the progress in four key areas: (i) immediate improvements to train capacity, (ii) immediate improvements to bus capacity, (iii) providing more and better public transport travel information, and (iv) other medium-term initiatives to improve the overall system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on train services.&nbsp; LTA has worked closely with the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) to increase the capacity of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. Since February this year, SMRT and SBST have injected some 800 additional train trips per week. This has led to shorter waiting times and less crowded trains around the peak hours and lunch time. For instance, the waiting time for a southbound train at Toa Payoh MRT station during the morning peak period, between 8.00 am and 8.30 am, has been reduced by about 15% to about 2 minutes. This means that even if a commuter may not be able to board the first train that arrives, he need not wait too long to board the next or subsequent trains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, with the additional train trips, crowding has been kept manageable despite a 13% surge in train ridership on the North-South East-West line between February and July 2008.&nbsp; At the most crowded stretches during peak hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>we <p align=left>Column: 17<p>are still seeing an acceptable level of loading of between 1,300&nbsp;and 1,400 passengers per train&nbsp;&ndash; or to put it in more concrete terms&nbsp;&ndash; approximately 4 persons/sqm.&nbsp; This is comparable&nbsp;if not&nbsp;better than other major cities such as Hong Kong, New York or Tokyo.&nbsp; Where train loading is persistently high, we will consider allowing bus services to run parallel to the MRT lines during peak hours, to help take some of the load off the trains.&nbsp; For example, Service 128 now runs parallel to sections of the North-South Line, from Ang Mo Kio to the CBD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, on bus services. Since June 2008, all trunk bus services plying along corridors affected by the ERP changes this year have improved their headways from 15 minutes to 12 minutes during peak hours.&nbsp; This will be further improved to not more than 10 minutes by 1st August 2009. In addition, the Public Transport Council (PTC) has tightened the Quality of Service (QoS) standards such that bus operators must operate at least 85% of their feeder bus services at headways of not more than 10 minutes during peak hours with effect from August 2008.&nbsp; This standard will be further tightened to 90% of feeder bus services by August 2009.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet the tighter QoS standards, and also as part of their continuous efforts to improve services, the PTOs are adding more buses and renewing their bus fleet.&nbsp; For example, SBS Transit recently announced that it will put 400 new Euro V buses on the road next year, at a cost of $147 million.&nbsp; Aside from basic bus services, we have also increased the number of premium bus services to 74, surpassing our initial target of 72 services.&nbsp; For commuters, premium bus services offer greater choice in the form of a faster, more direct and more comfortable journey.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In tandem with the increase in bus capacity, bus ridership has increased, by about 6%&nbsp; for the first half of 2008, <p align=left>Column: 18<p>compared to the same period last year. Crowding levels on our buses are regulated under the QoS standards, which the PTC administers.&nbsp; The PTC reviews the PTOs' compliance with the QoS standards, including passenger loading levels per bus, every&nbsp;six months.&nbsp; It is expected to provide the next update in October.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we are in the process of providing more and better public transport travel information.&nbsp;Commuters are currently already able to use an online Journey Planner on the Transitlink website to work out what services they need to take to reach their destination. This journey planner is integrated across operators and bus and rail modes.&nbsp; If they would like to suggest a new premium bus service route, they can also visit the online premium bus service demand aggregator tool, on LTA's website.&nbsp; If there is sufficient demand for a particular route from the community, LTA will approach operators to examine the viability of launching a new premium bus service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, in terms of the medium-term initiatives, LTA will be injecting greater contestability into the bus and rail sectors, by shortening the length of rail licences and tendering out packages of bus routes.&nbsp; Also, the PTC will introduce a new system of distance-based through fares by 2009, to give commuters greater flexibility in choosing the travel options that best suit their needs, including transfer journeys, without having to pay an extra fare penalty.&nbsp; The first step in this transition was announced last Friday, when the PTC said it will raise the transfer rebate from 25 cents to 40 cents.&nbsp; Also, by 2009, LTA will assume the role of central bus network planner, to ensure better optimisation and integration of bus and rail services, so that the entire public transport network including bus routes is designed holistically and with the commuters' interests in mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 19<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these initiatives mean change.&nbsp; Mr Zaqy has asked if we plan to consult community stakeholders and those affected by the changes. I would like to assure him that we will certainly do so.&nbsp; Currently, there is already extensive engagement at the grassroots and community level on transport issues including bus routes.&nbsp; Teams of managers from LTA's Community Partnership Division are assigned to each constituency, and have established strong relationships with local residents and grassroots leaders.&nbsp; If there are issues or suggestions on bus routes and services, LTA's officers will surface to the PTC for consideration.&nbsp; This process will continue, and as LTA takes on the bus planning role, LTA will also examine how to further engage community stakeholders to ensure bus routes will better meet the transport needs of the community.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B>&nbsp; Three supplementary questions for the Minister.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B>&nbsp; Sir, climate change is a global challenge.&nbsp; The direct effects of climate change include shifts in temperature, rainfall patterns, storm surges, and many others.&nbsp; In recent years, many countries have experienced more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events, such as the Hurricane Katrina in the US, Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar and episodes of severe floods in India and China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected in its Fourth Assessment Report, which was released last year, that climate change could result in sea level rises of between 18 cm and 59 cm by the year 2100.&nbsp; This does not factor in the rapid melting of Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets, as the understanding of these effects is too limited to assess their likelihood or provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea level rise.&nbsp; Scientists are currently working to better understand and project the rate at which the ice sheets may melt, as well as the resulting impacts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a relatively low-lying, densely populated island in the tropics, Singapore is vulnerable to climate change effects like sea level rises, which can lead to inland flooding.&nbsp; However, as a result of our environmental and developmental planning in the past, we already have existing measures in place that significantly reduce our exposure to the risks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1991, all new reclamation projects have to be built to a level 125 cm above the highest recorded tide level.&nbsp; This requirement is 66 cm more than the IPCC's projected highest sea level rise of 59 cm by the end of the 21st century in the worst case scenario.&nbsp; Singapore is as such well prepared for any further increases in sea level arising from climate <p align=left>Column: 22<p>change within the range of over&nbsp;one metre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of drainage infrastructure in Singapore over the last 30 years has also reduced flood-prone areas from 3,200 ha in the 1970s to 98 ha today.&nbsp; PUB will reduce it to less than 48 ha by 2011 through the development and improvement of drainage infrastructure in Singapore, such as the widening and the deepening of drains and canals.&nbsp; While the objective of this is to reduce the flood-prone areas and alleviate flooding today, the overall enhancement in the drainage system helps to reduce the possibility of upstream flooding when heavy rain coincides with high tide or sea level rise due to climate change.&nbsp; The completion of the Marina Barrage project has also enhanced our flood alleviation capabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we cannot be complacent in our efforts.&nbsp; It is important that we continue improving our understanding of the specific effects and impacts of climate change on Singapore.&nbsp; I announced last year that NEA, in consultation with other Government agencies, has commissioned a two-year study to understand the specific implications of climate change in Singapore, based on the IPCC studies.&nbsp; These include sea level and temperature changes, flooding and coastal erosion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study into Singapore's vulnerability to climate change is expected to be completed next year.&nbsp; It will help us better understand how Singapore will be affected and what needs to be done to protect Singapore and ensure that we are able to adapt to these impacts.&nbsp; We also continue to monitor closely the developments in scientific understanding of the melting of ice sheets and its impacts.&nbsp; Our study will give us modelling capability to factor in any new scientific findings to assess the localised effects on Singapore.&nbsp; This information will help in reviewing the <p align=left>Column: 23<p>adequacy of the existing adaptation measures and whether further enhancements are needed.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given that Singapore is a low-lying island, can I ask the Minister whether there are further moves to study from the Dutch about building dykes, given that we are very vulnerable to flooding?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

But having said that, we will continue to study any&nbsp;further scientific reports, including the one&nbsp;that was reported earlier, which is the question filed by Mr Low&nbsp;and Dr Lam, and we will study all these as part of the vulnerability study.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;her second point as to whether we have completed the interim study, the answer is yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings are preliminary in nature because this is a long-term study.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;will take us&nbsp;two years as&nbsp;we need to drill&nbsp;down the IPCC report&nbsp;to our context in Singapore which is located near the Straits of Malacca and South China Sea. From what we can understand, the preliminary findings show that the&nbsp;projection&nbsp;for sea-level rise is between 4 cm&nbsp;and 5 cm per century, and the sea level will increase over the global mean projection of 21 cm to 48 cm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So based on the preliminary findings, our requirement of 125 cm above the highest recorded tide-level is sufficient to deal with the estimates given by the preliminary findings. With that, we are now going into the second phase of the study where we are going even deeper <p align=left>Column: 25<p>into some other aspects of the effects of climate change on Singapore.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo, last question.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo</B>: &nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker.

The construction of the Marina Barrage has been completed and that of two new reservoirs at Punggol and Serangoon are scheduled to be completed next year. Together, they will increase our catchment area from half to two-thirds of Singapore&rsquo;s land area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the launch of NEWater in 2003, we have been successful in&nbsp;substituting potable water with NEWater for non-potable use, conserving precious potable water for drinking. The construction of our fifth and largest NEWater plant at Changi is currently in progress. When <p align=left>Column: 26<p>completed, NEWater will be able to meet 30% of our water needs by 2011, up from the current 15%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our fourth tap is desalinated water. The SingSpring desalination plant in Tuas was commissioned in 2005, and can supply up to 10% of our water demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, the implementation of the strategies under our Four National Taps approach ensures a robust and sustainable supply to meet Singapore&rsquo;s long-term water needs, and to be self-sufficient, if need be.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):</B> &nbsp; I would&nbsp;like to ask the Minister, in addition to the current available water technologies, what other R&amp;D project is the Government investing&nbsp;towards water self-sufficiency and maybe even more affordable modalities of fresh water generation?&nbsp;And the second question is: are there plans to continue importing water beyond the said agreement?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B>&nbsp; Sir, let me reply to the second question first.&nbsp; We have two agreements with Malaysia, one is expiring in 2011, the other one&nbsp;in 2061.&nbsp;The previous&nbsp;Minister and myself have&nbsp;mentioned in Parliament that we will not renew the 2011 agreement and we have&nbsp;communicated this to the Malaysians. For the 2061 agreement, it is still a long way to go. We will continue with that until the time comes for us to review it whether we want to prolong that or not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first question as to whether we are exploring other means, the answer is yes.&nbsp; We are exploring all other available technological solutions to harvest as much water&nbsp;as possible from Singapore's land area.&nbsp; NEWater has been our great success but we are not being complacent. For example, we have put a request for research proposal in which Simens has&nbsp;been awarded the contract to&nbsp;investigate <p align=left>Column: 27<p>how best we can reduce the energy costs for desalination.&nbsp; So we will try our very best to provide affordable water to Singaporeans and use technology to improve our water harvesting. Another example would be the Variability Salinity Plant, which is a water plant which can take both brackish water and river water&nbsp;at the same time. So we can change between slightly desalinated water and slightly&nbsp;fresh water and clean the&nbsp;water up.&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows us to put these plants at&nbsp;the various mouths of the&nbsp;canals across Singapore&nbsp;and thereby&nbsp;increasing the water harvesting&nbsp;in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;PUB is committed to finding new ways and means to improve our water supply but the solution lies in technology because Singapore is such a small space.

It is put in place to send an important message to Singaporeans that water is a strategic resource. Use it by all means but use it judiciously.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important lesson for us, as mentioned by Minister Mentor during the Singapore International Water Week, that we do not want to be thirsty any longer. So&nbsp;it is important for us to send that message and I do not think, at least&nbsp;in my time as <p align=left>Column: 28<p>Minister, that we will remove the water conversation tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not think the Singapore Government is also keen to remove it. What happens is that we will help people at the bottom who may have difficulties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the water tariff, we will continue to monitor the impact of energy price and other impacts on our water tariff. We will adjust it accordingly if there is a case to be made. At the moment, the water tariff is about the right level and we will keep it that way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the benefits&nbsp;of self-sufficiency, obviously, we will feel secure as there will&nbsp;be the constant supply of water to meet both our domestic and non-domestic needs.&nbsp; As&nbsp;I mentioned in my reply, if need be, we can be self-sufficient.&nbsp; At the moment, we have&nbsp;the Four National Taps and they are in place to give us the diversification and reliability of our water supply system and we will keep it&nbsp;at that.

So if you ask me, the CCC ComCare Fund available per CCC is about $50,000&nbsp;to $60,000 a year,&nbsp;which is much larger than the value of these utility vouchers.&nbsp; So we leave it to the Mayor to decide which one is more effective.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) (for the Minister for National Development):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;three ways for young couples to purchase <p align=left>Column: 36<p>a HDB flat, namely, Build-To-Order (BTO) for new flats to be constructed, Balloting Exercise (BE) for new flats already built or under construction and resale flats.&nbsp; The bulk of new flats for sale&nbsp;is through the BTO system.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average waiting time under the BTO system is about&nbsp;three years from the selection of flat to the collection of keys.&nbsp; This is the time taken to construct the flats.&nbsp; To shorten the waiting time for a new flat upon marriage, couples can apply under the Fiance-Fiancee Scheme.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has implemented various measures to improve the chances of First-Timers.&nbsp; At least 90% of BTO flats for public applicants are set aside for First-Timers.&nbsp; First-Timers are also given double the chances under the ballot over Second-Timers.&nbsp; They have&nbsp;four chances if they are&nbsp;buying a flat to live near/with their parents under the Married Child Priority Scheme.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, First-Timer applicants enjoy a very high chance of success in most BTO exercises.&nbsp; In&nbsp;six out of the&nbsp;eight completed BTO exercises between August 2007 and&nbsp;March 2008, 80% to 100% of First-Timer applicants were invited to select a flat.&nbsp; In other words, all First-Timers, in some instances, were invited to select a flat.&nbsp; In the remaining two projects, both located in Yishun, 54% to 65% of the First-Timers were invited to select the flats.&nbsp; In other words, one in two was invited to select the flat.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2008, HDB further refined its application process.&nbsp; To deter repeated non-selection of flats, First-Timer priority will be removed for those who turn down two chances to select a flat.&nbsp; At the same time, applicants who had been unsuccessful at least twice for BTO exercises in non-mature estates will be given additional chances from their third try onwards.&nbsp; Since the refinements, flat buyers have generally become more <p align=left>Column: 37<p>considered in their applications and the acceptance rates have improved.&nbsp; This suggests that the measures are effective in helping the more serious applicants to book a flat.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flat buyers looking for new flats already built or under construction can apply under the Balloting Exercise.&nbsp; However, BE launches are not frequent and consist of balance flats from the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).&nbsp; Due to the limited supply and high demand, the chances of selecting a flat under BE are not high.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First-Timers who need a flat urgently can buy a resale flat with the CPF Housing Grant of $30,000, or a higher grant of $40,000 if they stay with or near their parents.&nbsp; In addition, households earning a monthly income of less than $4,000 can also apply for the Additional CPF Housing Grant of up to $30,000.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, more First-Timers are turning to the resale market to meet their housing needs.&nbsp; In the second quarter of 2008, there were 1,470 cases of First-Timer flat buyers buying resale flats using the CPF Housing Grant.&nbsp; This is a 75% increase compared to the average of about 840 cases per quarter from the third quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I think a resale flat has a lot of advantages over a new flat. &nbsp;For example, there is a huge stock available out there and it is suited for applicants who have very locational specific requirements, and if they want to live near their parents for support, that is a very good reason to want to stay in a specific location.&nbsp; So resale flat actually has a lot of advantages.&nbsp; But, of course, cash-over-valuation (COV) is a consideration for many of the First-Timers, and that is really a reflection of the market condition. COV is an issue now,&nbsp;but it has not always been an issue.&nbsp; If you look at the COV in the past, particularly in the years from 2004 to 2006, COV was close to zero.&nbsp; So actually it is a reflection of the market condition, and I would urge First-Timers to basically watch the market carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very serious investment to buy a house and therefore choose the right place and&nbsp;pay the right price for it.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah):</B> &nbsp; I am just following up on the Senior Minister of State's comment earlier.&nbsp; Would&nbsp;MND consider changing the mechanism for the housing grant given to First-Timers buying resale flats? &nbsp;The grant could actually be delivered in cash rather than putting it <p align=left>Column: 39<p>straight into CPF, or an equivalent mechanism.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, MND would review the housing grant scheme and it has done so regularly over the last few years.&nbsp; We will continue to do so.&nbsp; At the moment, we do not have a plan to allow the use of grant to pay for COV for&nbsp;the simple reason that we believe that valuation is really what the house is worth and therefore we should not encourage buyers to pay above valuation.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ONE- AND TWO-ROOM RENTAL FLATS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:ONE- AND TWO-ROOM RENTAL FLATS:::44--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 39<p><B>ONE- AND TWO-ROOM RENTAL FLATS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Plans to meet pressing need--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Plans to meet pressing need)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

These are families:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) &nbsp;&nbsp;whose income exceeds $1,500;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;who have enjoyed two or more housing subsidies;

LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first group of families whose income exceeds $1,500, they are better off owning their own homes.&nbsp; The Government has kept home ownership affordable by providing generous housing subsidies, especially for the lower-income group.&nbsp; For example, a low-income family pays $200 a month in mortgage&nbsp;for a two-room flat.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

In contrast, it costs $1,000 a month to rent a two-room flat in <p align=left>Column: 41<p>the open market.&nbsp; Given the affordability of home ownership, subsidised rent should only be provided for the truly needy who cannot afford a basic flat even with the generous subsidies.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText2\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

Sir, home ownership remains relevant today.&nbsp; Besides providing a roof over one's head and promoting stakeholdership in the country, an ownership flat is also a store of value which appreciates in tandem with the country's economic growth.&nbsp; It allows Singaporeans to share in the fruits of Singapore's progress.&nbsp; When they retire, they are able to monetise their home ownership flats by either subletting a flat, a room or two rooms to earn rental income, or unlock their housing equity by downgrading to a smaller flat, or a studio apartment, or sign a lease&nbsp;buy-back&nbsp;scheme later next year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as mentioned earlier, the Government makes home ownership flats affordable for even the low income.&nbsp; In fact, for the lower-income families who are eligible by the&nbsp;Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) Scheme stand to benefit another $50,000 in CPF grants which can also be used for housing.&nbsp; So, technically, a low-income family can easily afford to have a two-room flat with monthly contribution of $200 into their mortgage loan.&nbsp; So, for a small group of needy citizens, as mentioned earlier, who cannot afford to buy a rental flat with our housing subsidies, the Government will continue to help them with a heavily subsidised rental flat.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For those who are downgrading and are competing with the lower-income families to get a two-room purchase flat, they actually have to pay a resale levy which will increase the price equivalent to the market rate.&nbsp;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, last year, Police arrested some 5,400 female foreigners for vice-related activities.&nbsp; 4,900 or 91% of these were in Singapore on Social Visit Passes.&nbsp; As a percentage of all social visit passes issued last year, this represents an abuse rate of 0.03%.&nbsp; As I said in this House earlier this year, there will always be a very small number among those who come to Singapore who enter under the pretext of social visits but engage in vice activities.&nbsp; This is a reality that we should expect with an open economy and with tourism as one of our key economic drivers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, MHA has in place&nbsp;a number of measures to detect and prevent sex workers from entering Singapore as far as possible under the guise of social visitors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain nationalities are&nbsp;required to apply for visas prior to entering Singapore.&nbsp; This enables ICA to screen travellers against ICA's records before they even travel to Singapore.&nbsp; If a visa applicant has adverse records or there are irregularities in her visa application, she will not be issued with a visa.&nbsp; The visa requirements are regularly reviewed and calibrated to deal with changes in trends and the operating environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 47<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a foreigner arrives in Singapore, she is subjected to face-to-face immigration clearance by ICA officers and screened against the various border control systems.&nbsp; Apart from scrutinising travel documents, ICA officers also assess the entry eligibility of each visitor.&nbsp; If the officer suspects that the visitor's intention of entering Singapore is dubious or non-genuine, the visitor will be referred to the Duty Officer for secondary examination.&nbsp; This includes screening the person's fingerprints against a database of immigration offenders.&nbsp; If it is established that the visitor has previous adverse records or is entering Singapore for dubious purposes, he or she will be denied entry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, some sex workers will still slip through the system.&nbsp; Such cases are then dealt with through Police enforcement.&nbsp; Last year, Police conducted more than 900 vice-related raids.&nbsp; These include major anti-vice operations as well as licensing checks on entertainment outlets and massage establishments. As a result, some 5,400 foreign sex workers were arrested.&nbsp; We take their biometric data, send them back home and blacklist them from entering Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Police is mindful that a woman in the vice trade may have been forced into prostitution or brought into Singapore under false pretences or against her will.&nbsp; Hence, Police has a dedicated vice unit that interviews every foreign sex worker arrested to establish whether there was any coercion or deception.&nbsp; Persons who have committed offences within Singapore will be dealt with in accordance with our laws.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Police also prosecuted 15 pimps and 30 vice-abetters in Court. &nbsp;Investigations were conducted to establish if any of the prostitutes involved with these pimps and vice operators were <p align=left>Column: 48<p>coerced, deceived or lured into vice.&nbsp; None was found to be so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, Sir,&nbsp;Singapore has a comprehensive legal framework and a robust operational framework to deal with vice and human trafficking.&nbsp; We will continue to fine-tune this framework as necessary.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B>&nbsp; Thank you, Minister, for the reply.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of the figures, especially given that 91% of women who are arrested for vice-related activities are either on Social Visit Passes (SVPs) or SVPs that had expired, what will MHA do to enhance the enforcement side, especially for the Anti-vice Branch, to further deter the rise of vice activities in Singapore and to deter the vice activities from encroaching into the heartlands?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

This is&nbsp;because sometimes&nbsp;the areas overlap.&nbsp; So&nbsp;to work in silo is not practical.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, more officers at the CID level are now available to do&nbsp;anti-vice work, including, of course, looking at the larger picture, intelligence gathering, and so forth.&nbsp; And on the ground, currently only selected officers from 'G' Division and 'A' Division have been empowered, under the Women's <p align=left>Column: 49<p>Charter, to carry out these vice raids.&nbsp; In fact, there are now moves to empower more officers from the other divisions to do likewise.&nbsp; So I do see a stepping up of enforcement on the ground.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B>&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;Speaker,&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the&nbsp;Minister whether he has any statistics on the number of males on work passes or Social Visit Passes who were arrested for vice-related activities and how is enforcement on anti-vice activities actually conducted and coordinated within the heartlands.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):&nbsp;</B> Sir, the recent high inflation has also impacted the operating cost of public hospitals.&nbsp; Tender prices of medicine and other medical supplies have significantly increased.&nbsp; In line with market movements in wage levels, public hospitals have adjusted the wages of their healthcare workers.&nbsp; In addition, we have made a conscious decision to significantly raise the staff-to-patient ratio, so as to meet rising patients&rsquo; expectation for longer consultations and shorter waiting times.&nbsp; All these factors have increased the hospitals&rsquo; running costs.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public hospitals will continue to absorb the bulk of the increases in cost.&nbsp; Our subsidy policy remains unchanged.&nbsp; Some adjustments in patients&rsquo; co-payment quantum are therefore inevitable.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As compared to last year, there has so far been no increase in the number of arrears cases.&nbsp; Patient cases in arrears after two months from discharge remain below 4%.&nbsp; Our system of heavy Government subsidies, Medisave, MediShield and Medifund has ensured that basic healthcare services in public hospitals remain affordable to all Singaporeans.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But during this period of high inflation, we have reminded our hospitals to be on the lookout for needy patients who might have a problem paying their bills.&nbsp; Patients can continue to ask the hospitals for their medical bills to be paid through instalments.&nbsp; We have increased the allocation for Medifund reimbursements substantially&nbsp;so that needy patients can get appropriate financial assistance.&nbsp; Two years ago, the Medifund reimbursements amounted to about $40 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised it to $50 million last year and for this year, the budget set aside is $70 million, which is a very substantial increase from the previous years.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column: 51<p>have also recommended that the Medifund Committees be especially flexible when evaluating the applications by elderly patients for assistance under Medifund-Silver.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are around 8,600 nursing home beds in Singapore, of which about 4,800 or 56% are subsidised beds.&nbsp; Most nursing homes can take in patients with dementia.&nbsp; Dementia covers a wide range of disabilities and differs in different degrees of complexities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of patients on the waiting list for subsidised nursing home fluctuates.&nbsp; For example, during the past year, it ranged from 68 to 193.&nbsp; But at any one point in time there were about 100 vacant beds available in subsidised <p align=left>Column: 52<p>nursing homes for placement during the same period.&nbsp; Some mismatch occurs as some patients have specific preferences such as location, operator and sometimes even diet.&nbsp; Some waiting is perhaps also sensible to minimise nursing home admission becoming too convenient a substitute for taking care of the elderly within the family. The majority of patients on the waiting list are placed within a month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Care is generally affordable as my Ministry provides the nursing homes with an operating subvention to help the lower income patients pay for their bills.&nbsp; For those who are more needy, Medifund is also available to assist.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, the demand for long-term care is growing with the ageing of our population, and this will pose a continuing challenge for us.&nbsp; We are investing more resources, including manpower, to expand the nursing home sector to meet the rising demand.&nbsp; We will also help upgrade the skills of the nursing home staff so that they can provide a higher service level and be more competent to care for patients with greater severity, particularly those with dementia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans can also help to play a part.&nbsp; First, stay active to delay or avoid the onset of long-term disability.&nbsp; That is why the Ministerial Committee chaired by Mr Lim Boon Heng actively promotes active ageing and there will be a series of wellness programmes being implemented at the community level.&nbsp; I hope the elderly Singaporeans&nbsp;will come and join in.&nbsp; It is for your own good.&nbsp; Second, subscribe to ElderShield and its supplements to ensure that we are better able to pay for any long-term care.&nbsp; Third, care for our elderly at home for as long as possible, so that they can be in the company of their families and friends.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And the current means test actually looks at per capita income of the household not exceeding $1,000 in order to qualify for the subsidy and this takes into account gross pay, which actually the CPF portion cannot be used to pay for the nursing home fees.&nbsp; So I wonder if the Government would consider perhaps relaxing the means test criteria so that more people can get some of the Government subsidies for the nursing home stay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The key point is what&nbsp;is the subvention for.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Medifund, we are&nbsp;aiming at assisting the bottom 20%-30% of the population.&nbsp; So, a short answer is \"yes\", we do review&nbsp;and&nbsp;adjust them&nbsp;as necessary.&nbsp;

This Bill is prompted by the Mental Capacity Bill which the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports will shortly take the House through.&nbsp; The Mental Capacity Bill aims to empower individuals to voluntarily plan in advance and appoint a proxy decision-maker for a time when they may lack mental capacity.&nbsp; It will also allow parents to apply to the court for the appointment of a proxy decision-maker for their intellectually disabled children.&nbsp; The Mental Capacity Bill will replace and update Part I of the existing Mental Disorders and Treatment Act.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mental Health (Care&nbsp;and Treatment) Bill will in turn replace Parts II and III of the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act.&nbsp; It aims to regulate the involuntary detention of a person in a psychiatric institution for treatment if:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;he is suffering from a mental disorder which warrants the detention for treatment; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;it is necessary in the interests of the health or safety of the person or for the protection of other persons that the person be detained.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many other countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, have similar provisions for involuntary treatment for persons suffering from mental disorders whose ability to make decisions about medical treatment is significantly <p align=left>Column: 58<p>impaired and who are likely to suffer mental, behavioural or physical deterioration without prompt and adequate treatment.&nbsp; Our Bill will maintain parity with modern best practices&nbsp;to strengthen the safeguards to protect the patients who are involuntarily detained for treatment.&nbsp; For example, regular inspections have to be conducted by visitors appointed by the Minister and a Magistrate's order is required for the detention of a patient beyond a certain period.&nbsp; The improper detention of a person, or wilful neglect or ill-treatment of a patient, will be an offence under the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me elaborate on each of the proposed amendments.</p><p><br> <I>Definitions</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will replace the term 'mental hospitals' with 'psychiatric institutions'.&nbsp; A part of a hospital (for example, a ward or a department) may now be designated as a 'psychiatric institution' for the reception and treatment of the mentally ill, instead of an entire hospital.&nbsp; This will give us greater flexibility to alter the capacity to meet changing demand in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Procedures</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a patient who has voluntarily admitted himself to a psychiatric institution may now be detained pursuant to an order of a designated medical practitioner, if he is assessed to be a danger to himself or others.&nbsp; This is to facilitate prompt treatment.&nbsp; Currently, a detention order may only be made in respect of a person who has not yet been admitted into the mental hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we are reducing the minimum frequency of inspections by visitors appointed by the Minister for Health from once a month to once every three months.&nbsp; This will enable us to set the <p align=left>Column: 59<p>frequency in accordance with needs.&nbsp; For example, where a psychiatric institution has not had adverse reports for a long period, a reduced frequency&nbsp;may be&nbsp;justified.&nbsp; This is a practical step to reduce the load on the visitors.&nbsp; The visitors are, however, required to submit a report to the Director of Medical Services after every inspection.&nbsp; Based on these reports, the Director of Medical Services may then direct the visitors to conduct further inspections as necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Strengthening safeguards&nbsp;</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, after the first month of detention, any further detention, if ordered by two designated doctors, will be capped at a maximum of&nbsp;six months.&nbsp; This is half of the current provision.&nbsp; For detention beyond&nbsp;six months, a Magistrate's order will be required.&nbsp; These safeguards are to ensure that patients are not detained beyond what is medically required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, a detained patient who requires treatment for an acute medical condition other than his mental disorder may now be transferred to another hospital, and be temporarily detained there.&nbsp; This arrangement is necessary, as psychiatric institutions may not have the necessary facilities for managing these acute medical conditions.&nbsp; There is currently no such provision in the Mental Disorders&nbsp;and Treatment Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Penalties</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we are updating the penalties for certain offences to ensure that they have a deterrent effect and to&nbsp;be on par with equivalent legislation.&nbsp; We are increasing the maximum penalties of fines and imprisonment for offences committed against patients who have to be detained for treatment.&nbsp; These patients are in a vulnerable situation and we need to send <p align=left>Column: 60<p>a clear message that abuse of such patients will not be tolerated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;First, the maximum penalties for ill treating a patient will be raised.&nbsp; Ill-treatment includes physical or sexual abuse, as well as wilful or unreasonable endangerment or neglect of a patient.&nbsp; Currently, the maximum penalty is a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment for up to&nbsp;two years or both.&nbsp; The Bill increases this to a maximum fine of $5,000 or imprisonment for up to&nbsp;four years or both.&nbsp; If death is caused to the patient, the penalty will be a maximum fine of $20,000 or imprisonment for up to&nbsp;seven years or both.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;Second, the penalty for having sexual intercourse with a patient will be increased from a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to&nbsp;two years or both, to a maximum fine of $20,000 or imprisonment for up to 10 years or both.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;Third, the penalty for improperly receiving or detaining a patient will be increased from a maximum fine of $2,000 or imprisonment for up to&nbsp;two years or both, to a maximum fine of $5,000 or imprisonment for up to&nbsp;three years or both.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;Fourth, a police officer is empowered to visit and inspect a mentally disordered person under the care of a person to ascertain whether or not that mentally disordered person is under proper care and control or is ill-treated or neglected.&nbsp; The Bill enhances the maximum fine for refusing to produce the mentally disordered person for inspection from $1,000 to $4,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;Lastly, the maximum amount for which a minor offence under the Bill may be compounded will be&nbsp;raised from $500 to $2,000.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the care and treatment of the mentally ill has evolved <p align=left>Column: 61<p>over the years and it will continue to evolve, in the light of experience and medical &nbsp;knowledge.&nbsp; Increasingly, care and treatment for most mentally ill is best done in the community setting.&nbsp; But it is sometimes necessary to detain some mentally disordered persons in a psychiatric institution, to safeguard the health and safety of the patients and to protect the others in the community.&nbsp; In such cases, we have to ensure that the power to detain is not abused.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill updates and strengthens the safeguards for the detained patients under such circumstances.&nbsp; I hope to get the support of all Members for this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I rise in support of this Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The World Health Organisation (WHO) has classified mental illness as a major health issue that will drain the coffers of many countries. In Singapore, too, we see a steady increase in the number of people suffering from mental illness. In 2006 alone, IMH treated close to 33,000 patients for mental illness in its outpatient clinics. A rapidly ageing population has added to the complexity as there are now more dementia cases. It is, therefore, in our interest to ensure that we have a proper legislation in place before the situation worsens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, welcome this new Bill. It is indeed timely for us to review the existing law to ensure that it is up to date and relevant. The Mental Disorders and Treatment Act that this Bill seeks to replace was passed in 1952 and seriously needs updating. According to the WHO,&nbsp;\"progressive legislation can be an effective tool to promote access to mental <p align=left>Column: 62<p>health care as well as to promote and protect the rights of persons with mental disorders\".&nbsp; However, according to the WHO,&nbsp;\"in some countries where legislation has not been updated for many years, mental health legislation has resulted in the violation, rather than the promotion, of human rights of persons with mental disorders. This is because much of the mental health legislation initially drafted was aimed at safeguarding members of the public from \"dangerous\" patients and isolating them from the public, rather than promoting the rights of persons with mental disorders as people and citizens. Other legislation permitted long-term custodial care of persons with mental disorders who posed no danger to society but were unable to care for themselves, and this too resulted in a violation of human rights\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Sir, I was hoping to see a different approach being taken in our legislation in the treatment and care of mentally disordered persons. But I find that the Bill has fundamentally kept the same approach which can be summed up as one that is based on institutional care and is rules based. Quite a large portion of the Bill dealt with giving powers to the Police to arrest mentally disordered persons and powers to the Magistrate and the psychiatric institution to admit or further detain a mentally disordered person for treatment. The Bill also now seeks to increase the fine for family members who fail to provide for the proper care and control of a mentally disordered person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also concerned that while this Bill has strengthened the provisions to protect the public interest through a longer period of detention of a mentally disordered person, there is very little mentioned about protecting the rights of the mentally disordered persons. While I understand the need to protect the public, there is also a need to protect the rights of the mentally disordered persons from unnecessary and prolonged detention that <p align=left>Column: 63<p>will deprive him of his freedom. I note that there is greater clarity now under section 22 on punishments for those who ill treat a patient in a psychiatric institution but more can be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Bill, Sir,&nbsp;wants caregivers to assume greater legal responsibility for the care and maintenance of mentally disordered persons, there is little support for caregivers in the community to perform their role. Caregivers need greater support as they often suffer as much as if not more than the mentally disordered person whom they are taking care of. While the Bill makes it an offence for caregivers to ill-treat or neglect persons who are mentally disordered, it ignores the fact that the mentally disordered persons are at times the perpetrators of harassment and violence against their caregivers. With the rising cost of medical care, it is certainly not cheap for caregivers to provide for the medical needs of mentally disordered family members when medical care is often needed over a long term period. Caregivers too have a life of their own. They need to work and have other family members to take care of. Often, when there is a mentally disordered family member, caregivers face financial, mental and emotional burnouts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a young man, Sir, in my constituency who suffers from severe mental illness. He lives in a 3-room flat with his mother who works as a cleaner to support him. They are on financial assistance as the young man is unable to work due to the side effects from the medication that he is taking, sometimes a problem particularly with the older, cheaper variety that&nbsp;is commonly prescribed. His mother worries about who will take care of him when she is no longer around. I have another family with a son in his 30s also suffering from severe mental illness. Once he jumped down <p align=left>Column: 64<p>from a four-storey building and on another occasion he slided down the rubbish chute, on both occasions after hearing voices. He miraculously survived both episodes. His elderly parents now do not leave home without him. I wonder whether they could be charged for neglect under this Bill as on one of the occasions when the incident occurred, he was left alone at home when one parent was working and the other went to do some errands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another gap, Sir,&nbsp;in the treatment and care of mentally disordered people is after a person is discharged from hospital. He gets very little support from the community because there are just not enough step-down care facilities and services. Home care services and support for families taking care of mentally disordered family members at home&nbsp;are also limited. There are not enough community-based programmes to help in the continued rehabilitation of people with mental disorders. The few that exist run by VWOs like the Singapore&nbsp;Association of Mental Health&nbsp;(SAMH), the Hougang Care Centre and the Silver Ribbon, are under funded and under resourced. They need more funding support especially as some of them run residential programmes and the cost of living has gone up. We all know that lack of support to help people with serious mental disorders after their discharge from hospitals often leads to relapses. With every relapse and re-admission into hospital, there is a terrible cost to the Government and society as most mentally disordered people cannot afford private rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the need for accommodation is another pressing issue for those who are mentally disordered. Three-quarters of the 1,600 patients in IMH have been there for at least three months. About 300 have been there for&nbsp;10 years or more. Even VWOs are finding it hard to cope with the demand. In the Simei Care Centre, which was set up in 2005 to provide short-term <p align=left>Column: 65<p>rehabilitative care to the mentally ill, a number of their patients have stayed on for at least three years. At the Sunlove Home, 70 of the 207 patients have been abandoned by their families. I hope that the Ministry could re-examine the basis of its current funding to some of these shelters for the mentally disordered which is inadequate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me share with this House the Australian example. In 2006, the Australian federal government allocated A$1.8 billion for the expansion of mental services over a period of five years. With this budget, the Australian government will fund 900 personal helpers and mentors to support those with serious mental illness live at home after their discharge from hospital. Carers will help those in need cope with everyday problems such as taking medicines and arranging accommodation. The funding will also expand support for accommodation provided to those with long-term mental illness. There is also funding for respite services for up to 15,000 families who care for relatives with severe mental illness or intellectual disability, with priority given to the elderly.&nbsp; So, Sir, the Australian example shows that they have adopted a much more community based, holistic approach towards treatment and care of mentally disordered persons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Sir, I would now like to seek some clarifications from the Minister on matters related to the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under section 2, mental disorder will now cover not only mental illness but also \"any other disorder or disability of the mind\". This is very wide as it would also cover mental retardation (also known as mental handicap and intellectual disability) and personality disorders. In most countries, these categories are usually separated. Could the Minister clarify whether it is in the best interest of a person suffering from mental retardation <p align=left>Column: 66<p>or autism, for instance, to be subject to the same regulatory regime as a mentally ill person and be detained for a prolonged period in a psychiatric institution?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under section 10, a mentally disordered person can be involuntarily admitted into hospital for treatment or even if he admits himself voluntarily, the hospital is given the power to detain him longer. Section 10(5) provides that the hospital can detain him for an extended period of six months, which has been reduced&nbsp;from 12 months&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I agree with the Minister&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;but section 13(3) provides for the mentally disordered person to be detained for up to 12 months if ordered by the Magistrate and this could be further extended. Involuntary detention in a psychiatric institution for a prolonged period has come under scrutiny in many jurisdictions as it restricts a person&rsquo;s rights and there is also potential for abuse. The WHO recommended that where involuntary treatment is necessary, the patients and their families and/or personal representatives must have a right to appeal to a review body, tribunal and or court against the imposition of involuntary treatment. The UK is one example which followed the WHO's advice as it provides for a Mental Health Review Tribunal to review the appeals of a person detained in a psychiatric institution under the UK Mental Health Act. The Tribunal has the power to order the discharge of any patient who is involuntarily admitted if it feels that there is no need to do so. Could the Minister explain what recourse does a mentally disordered person have under this Bill to ask for earlier release from involuntary detention in a psychiatric institution? Has the balance in the new Bill been tilted too much in favour of protecting the public but which may in fact affect the rights of those with mental disorders? How are the rights of a mentally disordered person protected from arbitrary exercise of power now that the powers of detention have been increased? Would the Minister consider establishing a <p align=left>Column: 67<p>Mental Health Review Tribunal, akin to the UK situation,&nbsp;to provide recourse to persons detained under this Act if they are unhappy with their long detention period?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as an alternative to the involuntary detention and treatment of mentally disordered persons, could the Minister consider compulsory community supervision or treatment orders which are already commonly found in many developed countries? Such orders decrease hospitalisation and total hospital days when they are accompanied by intensive community-based treatment, which requires substantial commitment of manpower and financial resources, and I admit that. But these are less restrictive and would generally include outpatient treatment, day hospital treatment, partial hospitalisation programmes and home-based treatment. New Zealand,&nbsp;for example, has revised its mental health legislation to accord with the least restrictive principle. Under the New Zealand Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act, when a court has ruled that the certification criteria (for involuntary treatment) have been met,&nbsp;&ldquo;the court shall make a community treatment order unless the court considers that the patient cannot be treated adequately as an outpatient, in which case the court shall make an inpatient order&rdquo;.&nbsp; The new Bill,&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;does not provide for supervised community treatments at all as it focuses primarily on institutionalised care which is not the best alternative as prolonged detention infringes on personal liberty whilst not necessarily ensuring the desired outcomes in the treatment of the mentally disordered. Compulsory community supervision and treatment&nbsp;are not only more humane but also provide a more holistic approach in the treatment of the mentally disordered as it complements the other <p align=left>Column: 68<p>treatment methods and provides the much needed community support for those released from institutional care. Could I, therefore, ask the Minister to study the feasibility of introducing compulsory community supervision and treatment?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under section 5, visitors are now required to inspect a psychiatric institution only once in&nbsp;three months and not once a month as is required under the existing Act. Could the Minister explain how less number of visits would benefit the mentally disordered patients and ensure better protection for them? Also, under the new section 5, the visitors need not inspect every part of the psychiatric institution and see and examine every patient as is required under the existing law. Instead, under the Bill, visitors need to visit only any part of the psychiatric institution or see and examine any patients. Could the Minister clarify how this can be considered as an improvement since visitors are now needed to visit perhaps&nbsp;only a few patients and only some parts of the psychiatric institution?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under section 7, a police officer is authorised to apprehend any mentally disordered person who &ldquo;is believed to be dangerous&rdquo; to himself or to others.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify what constitutes dangerous behaviour?&nbsp; Could the Minister also clarify what procedures and protocols are in place for the Police to ensure that there are proper safeguards so that the Police can play a constructive and helpful role with respect to people with mental disorders during arrest?&nbsp; Are police officers trained to handle people with mental disorders and how do they assess that a mentally disordered person is indeed dangerous to himself or others?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under section 8(4), the fine for a caregiver&nbsp;to produce a mentally disordered person for inspection by a police officer has been increased four times, from $1,000 to $4,000. Could the Minister explain the rationale for this four-fold <p align=left>Column: 69<p>increase in fines which would cause tremendous hardship to the caregivers, most of whom are already struggling to provide for their mentally disordered family members?&nbsp; So the question is: would increasing the fine help to address the problem or are we only trying to deal with the symptoms?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, could the Minister enlighten this House on what measures will be taken to increase the number of psychiatrists to put this Bill into effect? There are about 115 psychiatrists in Singapore, giving a psychiatrist-to-population ratio of about 2.6 per 100,000, which is low compared to other developed countries like the USA, which has a ratio of 13.7 per 100,000, the UK (11 per 100,000), and Australia (14 per 100,000). There is also a shortage across the whole range of mental health professionals: psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, psychiatric case managers, medical social workers and occupational therapists?&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister what measures are being taken to recruit and train more of these staff as well?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, could the&nbsp;Ministry of Health&nbsp;also focus more on early intervention programmes as early treatment certainly makes a difference?&nbsp; The Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP)&nbsp;is a good start but more can be done, particularly in schools and at the workplace. In the labour market, one big problem faced by mentally disordered people is the difficulty of getting a job as employers are not willing to employ them. Could they be provided with stronger support and more assistance?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, could the Minister also review the current situation where mentally disordered persons are excluded from MediShield coverage causing them hardship as their illness requires long-term treatment, particularly long-term hospitalisation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 70<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, could the Minister give an update to this House on the progress made by the Inter-Ministerial Committee which was appointed last year with the task of rolling out a roadmap to tackle mental illness? What are the measurables and how have the lives of mentally disordered persons improved? Could the Minister also enlighten this House as to how much of the $88&nbsp;million&nbsp;that has been set aside to implement this mental roadmap&nbsp;is allocated to funding the various VWOs that are running shelters and programmes for the mentally disordered as they are under-funded and under-resourced?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion,&nbsp;this new Bill is but one of the measures that will help to provide for the better care and treatment of mentally disordered persons. However, nothing contained in this Bill can overcome the prejudice, stigma and discrimination that mentally disordered persons face everyday of their lives. It is this stigma that often prevents individuals from seeking treatment early when the chances of recovery are better. It is this stigma that prevents them from landing a job, renting a room or integrating with the rest of society. It is this stigma that often makes them feel like lesser human beings and affects their recovery. To remove this stigma and prejudice requires more than the law. It requires the effort of everyone. For a start, we should start an education campaign to raise awareness and stamp out prejudice and narrow mindedness. I think we owe it to our mentally disordered Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the Bill, Sir.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>3.30 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to begin by quoting Dr Johann Christian Reil, one of the most progressive psychiatrists of his era, in the late 18th century.&nbsp; He said:<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"It is difficult to understand the incredible inhumanity with which mentally-sick citizens <p align=left>Column: 71<p>were treated.&nbsp; We incarcerate these miserable creatures as if they were criminals in abandoned jails, near to the lairs of owls in barren canyons beyond the city gates, or in damp dungeons of prisons, where never a pitying look of a humanitarian penetrates; and we let them, in chains, rot in their own excrement.&nbsp; Their fetters have eaten off the flesh of their bones, and their emaciated pale faces look expectantly toward the graves which will end their misery and cover up our shamefulness.&nbsp; Excited patients were locked naked into narrow closets and fed through holes from copperware attached to chains.&nbsp; Beatings were common and defended by shallow rationalisations.&nbsp; Strait jackets and chains attached to walls or beds were used to restrain patients, since the theory was that the more painful the restraint, the better the results, particularly with obstinate psychotics.&nbsp; The unsanitary conditions, lack of nourishment, wounds inflicted by the chains, and application of drastic skin irritants to increase the torment killed a large number of these patients.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, what I just recounted were not just fictional stories that could possibly be made into box-office movies, such as the likes of Hannibals or&nbsp;the Silence of the Lambs.&nbsp; Such stories still exist in this day and age, though not to such horrific extent all over the world in mental institutions and homes, whose <I>raison d'etre</I> is to provide the very refuge, protection and care for these vulnerable human beings suffering from mental illnesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a highly stressful urban society like Singapore, we do expect to see more people suffering from some form of mental illnesses.&nbsp; In addition, as more people are living longer, the incidence of the elderly developing age-related degenerative diseases of the brain, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer and senile dementia, is expected to rise as well.&nbsp; By the year 2050, Singapore would have the <p align=left>Column: 72<p>world's fourth oldest population.&nbsp; The introduction of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Bill is not only timely but also an important step in the right direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia or&nbsp;dementia, are growing&nbsp;problems plaguing many developed countries.&nbsp; In the United States, the Alzheimer's Association estimated that the direct and indirect cost of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia amounts to about US$145 billion annually.&nbsp; A study on Singapore in 2004 estimated that about 5.6% of our adult population suffers from some form of depression.&nbsp; This figure works out to more than 200,000 based on our current population size of four million.&nbsp; This is indeed an alarming figure for our healthcare delivery system to tackle.&nbsp; If not managed properly, the cost overrun could be catastrophic to our national health budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the estimated number of 200,000 people suffering from depression, our Institute of Mental Health only treated a total of 33,000 patients last year, as alluded to by Mdm Halimah.&nbsp; This disparity in number of afflicted and those who sought treatment can be attributed to our Asians' perception of&nbsp;mental illness.&nbsp; Because of the stigma attached to mental illnesses, Asians are reluctant to seek treatment early when confronted with mental illnesses.&nbsp; Asians also have a tendency of somaticising psychological distress as physical pain.&nbsp; Experts in the field are in general agreement that early treatment of mental illnesses is crucial.&nbsp; Hence, I would like to urge the Ministry to engage and train primary healthcare givers, such as GPs, to help identify and provide early treatment, and to refer them to a specialist before the illness deteriorates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Hong Kong, mental healthcare faces critical manpower shortage problem <p align=left>Column: 73<p>resulting in compromised quality of care, as well as physical and mental burnout of the caregivers.&nbsp; The situation in Hong Kong is likened to having five lids for 10 boiling teapots.&nbsp; Comparatively, in Singapore, as our population grows, the number of mental healthcare givers needs to correspondingly grow with it.&nbsp; The question to ask thus is,&nbsp;\"Do we have an adequate number of mental healthcare professionals?\"&nbsp; In the US and Canada, the ratio of professional psychiatric caregiver to the population is about 1:8,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas WHO recommends that the ratio should be about 1:19,000.&nbsp; According to the Singapore Medical Council's annual report, there are currently about 114 psychiatrists practising in Singapore.&nbsp; Based on WHO's recommendation, we should, therefore, have 210 doctors specialising in psychiatry.&nbsp; We need to act now, given the length of time needed to train the necessary medical professionals to meet these rising demands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is a fact that mental patients are more vulnerable to abuse than their perceived image of \"danger\".&nbsp; Mental patients, because of the nature of their ailments, are prone to abuse with possibly little recourse.&nbsp; In that respect, I support the harsher penalty imposed for the ill-treatment of patients by healthcare givers as it serves as an effective deterrent against such acts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Sir, let me declare my interest as a member of the healthcare profession.&nbsp; I am a little concerned over the possibility of wrongful prosecution of mental healthcare givers.&nbsp; Mental healthcare providers are exposed to a wide range&nbsp;of patients with mental illnesses, many of whom are of the violent type.&nbsp; For instance, healthcare providers taking care of patients suffering from paranoid schizophrenia are susceptible to violent manipulation.&nbsp; In addition, given their mental state, the injury and ill-treatment <p align=left>Column: 74<p>may be self-inflicted, leading to the wrongful prosecution of healthcare givers.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry can recognise this possibility, no matter how remote, when investigating alleged claims of abuse by mental patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in the prosecution of ill-treatment, the same predicament faced by family caregivers needs to be taken into consideration, and judicious enforcement necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, seemingly innocent problems are quite common for the elderly with mental illness.&nbsp; Hence, the issue of ill-treatment to people with mental illness, especially family members who are caregivers, needs to be enforced with greater care and sensitivity.&nbsp; For instance, the demented person may complain to others for being ill-treated by not being fed, while in actual fact they had been fed but could not recall recent events because of the nature of their sickness.&nbsp; Family members are already quite stressed out taking care of one of their members with mental disturbances, and may just keel over when confronted with unnecessary investigations into allegations of ill-treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to clarify with the Minister the reason for not stating the penalty for family members guilty of ill-treating mental patients in clause 8 of the Bill.&nbsp; Perhaps, family members who ill-treat mental patients, like Mr Sujit Kumar from Fiji, known to millions around the world as the Chicken Boy, who was confined in a chicken-coop by his family for almost 20 years.&nbsp; It is equally culpable.&nbsp; I understand the need to be sensitive and not to over-burden family members who are caregivers, but it is imperative to send the right signals that we do not condone any ill-treatment of mental patients by anyone.&nbsp; And the Bill needs to be fair in prosecuting any wrong-doers, whether they are healthcare givers, family members or anyone else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 75<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to seek clarifications from the Minister on the following issues:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The Bill amends the maximum detention period of mental patients from 12 to six months, with further extensions requiring&nbsp; Magistrate approval.&nbsp; However, the Bill does not state if there is maximum period for this Magistrate's imposition.&nbsp; I would think that the maximum period is necessary as it mandates a thorough review of the patient's status before a further extension is allowed.&nbsp; Thus, preventing unnecessary prolonged detention of any mental patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp; Clause 15(5) allows a transfer to another hospital for treatment of non mental-related illness.&nbsp; This initiative is good as it allows prompt treatment of the non-medical condition in a better equipped facility.&nbsp; However, one concern is that when deciding on the medical facility for such a transfer, it should ideally be equipped in terms of physical infrastructure to handle such mental patients, especially if they are violent or suicidal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In clause 10 of the Bill, what is the definition of the designated medical practitioner?&nbsp; Must they be specialists, ie, psychiatrists?&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, can the designated medical practitioner who has the power to sign the order to detain up to one month&nbsp;be a non-specialist and potentially a trainee or junior doctor?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, let me quote from an American writer, Renata Adler, best known for articles in <I>The New Yorker&nbsp;</I>magazine:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Nothing defines the quality of life in a community more clearly than people who regard themselves, or whom the consensus chooses to regard, as mentally unwell.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 76<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.41 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, allow me to tell a story from a popular movie from Hong Kong some 20 years ago.&nbsp; The title of the movie was \"<I>tian cai yu bai chi</I> \".&nbsp; Literally translated into English, it reads \"The Genius and A Fool\".&nbsp; The scene that I remember revolved around a mental hospital and the dialogue between a mental patient and one of the main actors.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This patient was squatting and holding a fishing rod over a bucket of water.&nbsp; He was asked what he&nbsp;was&nbsp;doing and replied that he was fishing.&nbsp; The protagonist then asked him how many fish he had&nbsp;caught that day.&nbsp; The patient replied,&nbsp;\"Are you crazy?&nbsp; This is just a bucket.&nbsp; How to get any fish?&nbsp; I may be mental, but I am not stupid!\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this episode is fictitious and culled&nbsp;from a movie, it does illustrate the difficult task of defining what mental illness is.&nbsp; It also highlights one thing, ie, all mental patients&nbsp;&ndash; or the more politically-correct term is patients suffering from mental illness&nbsp;&ndash; are human beings too, like you and me.&nbsp; They have their feelings, wits and ability to think.&nbsp; Although they may be deluded and hearing voices when they become unwell, they can be treated and become rational.&nbsp; Certainly, they are not stupid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to declare my interest as a practising psychiatrist.&nbsp; Mental illnesses cover a broad area of human ailments.&nbsp; It is a problem that can afflict the young, the old and the not-so-old.&nbsp; A child going to school for the first time might suffer from school refusal, which is considered a form of mental illness.&nbsp; A person hearing imaginary voices is suffering from mental illness.&nbsp; So is an elder person who has degenerative brain diseases presenting behavioural problems <p align=left>Column: 77<p>and/or deteriorating memories.&nbsp; Another person not being able to sleep without an&nbsp;increasing dosage of medication may also suffer from some form of mental illness.&nbsp; In such instances, medication may worsen the patient's condition when&nbsp;the patient actually needs ultimately to be weaned off the medication to be on the road to recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is a thin line after that between a medical problem and a psychological problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill seeks to protect the mentally ill but fails to be clear about the definition of the area of mental illness to be covered.&nbsp; This point was also brought up by Mdm Halimah.&nbsp; In fact, the onus appears to be lop-sided, weighing on the psychiatrist to set out the parameters of what&nbsp;mental illness is.&nbsp; Therefore, given the many varied types, it would be&nbsp;overly onerous.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry can be clearer in its definition of the type of mental illness that the Bill seeks to address.&nbsp; Moreover, the proposed Bill involves only doctors in the decision-making of applying this detention order or order for involuntary treatment in the hospital.&nbsp; In the UK, Australia and a number of other developed countries, these detention orders are often made</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>jointly by a psychiatrist and a social worker. I urge the Ministry to consider adopting a similar approach. Having such an approach will allow a more rounded and&nbsp;informed decision when an application is made. The social worker will balance the views of the psychiatrist and they will have to ensure that the patient's social and family backgrounds have been investigated and considered before any order can be applied</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like to touch on the problems of patient-therapist relationship. Confidential relationship between patient and therapist or psychiatrist is different when it concerns people with mental illness. Unlike the usual patient-doctor relationship&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;where patient confiden-<p align=left>Column: 78<p>tiality overrides most other considerations&nbsp;&ndash; when it concerns mental patients,&nbsp;we are on a slippery ground. In this Bill, I hope we can be clear where we stand. Do we make a clear stand now and debate in this House, or do we wait until something similar to the Tatiana Tarasoff's case before we act?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to narrate briefly what happened to this Tarasoff's case. This is a case of <I>Tarasoff vs the Regents of the University of California</I>. The family of Tatiana Tarasoff sued the Regents of the University of California for failing to act after Mr Poddar confided to his psychiatrist, Dr Moore, that he intended to kill Ms Tarasoff. Dr Moore diagnosed Mr Poddar as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, then ordered Mr Poddar's detention, but was overruled by his supervisor. Mr Poddar plotted, waited and when the opportunity arose, he ended up killing Ms Tarasoff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The California Supreme Court made the landmark ruling that a professional mental health body has an obligation not only to the patient, but also to the individual&nbsp;whom the patient specifically wanted to harm. The California Supreme Court ruling has not been accepted all over the United States, but has influenced many other judiciaries as well. In our case, since the Bill is being presented in this House, it might be in our favour to deliberate and debate it to reach a consensus. It would not be fair to leave it to our judiciary to second guess our intent. Do we take the majority stand that the communication between patient and therapist must yield to the extent where disclosure could avert essential danger to others? Or do we take the stand that the protection privileges of the patients rule supreme? This is an important issue which unfortunately the Bill does not seem to address. I would like to see the Health Minister present his learned views and then let the House debate on this issue on the sacrosanct rights of a patient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 79<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we are still on this subject, I am concerned, on the other hand, about the lack of security of mental patients' rights and welfare. I echo the call&nbsp;by Mdm Halimah. To protect the rights of the patients, we must adopt a balanced approach between protecting public interest and maintaining the dignity of and respect for the patient. Just as while bacteria are not visible to the naked eye it does not mean that it is not present. Similarly, the absence of abuse of mental patients&nbsp;does not mean that it does not happen either. Given the inability of mental patients when they are unwell to control over their mind, and as an extension, ability to protect themselves, mental patients' right has to be clearly safeguarded. For example, when a patient is involuntarily institutionalised, patients should retain the right to be visited by&nbsp;the family, the right to legal counsel and the right to appeal against&nbsp;involuntary institutionalisation. The recourse to appeal needs to be immediate and not allowed to drag on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, mental illness is unique&nbsp;from other physical illnesses. Hence, if a patient has an acute mental illness, and especially since he is still lucid or&nbsp;during his&nbsp;lucid moment, his appeal against institutionalisation ought to be heard and considered immediately. To this end, the United Kingdom's Mental Health provision for&nbsp;a Tribunal could be exemplary for us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to relate another story, Sir. It was told to me that&nbsp;a cheerful young boy working as an office assistant had an acute stress-induced nervous breakdown when he was travelling with&nbsp;his office colleagues to New Zealand. He ran away from his hotel room in the middle of the night, ostensibly waiting for his flight to take him home. While waiting all alone in the airport, he started to display his clothing all over the floor. The police found him, brought him back to the <p align=left>Column: 80<p>hotel and the next day, he was brought to the psychiatric hospital where he spent the night. The boy related later that when he was in the hospital, he begun to regain his own composure and was calmer after the hospital had given him some medication. He was normal but they insisted on retaining him overnight in the hospital, together with other more seriously-ill mental patients. He went through a terrible time and no one would listen to him that he was well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, not all mental patients are alike and most mental patients are not a threat to society at large. Therefore, there must be a recourse to appeal and communications with the mental patient must always be maintained and established. I recognise that the Bill does attempt to provide some form of external audit. But if someone has been detained on a six-monthly order, waiting for six months is&nbsp;cold comfort to cases like the boy I have just mentioned. It might be too late for the boy. He would have been frightened by the terrible experience of living in a mental hospital and \"gone mad\" literally. The law must guarantee that&nbsp;immediate appeals and communications&nbsp;are allowed. Both England and Scotland made amendments to their Mental Health Act that, amongst other things, weigh heavily on protecting the rights of mental patients. In particular, both England and Scotland allow for the formation of a Mental Health Tribunal as the forum to hear cases to decide on compulsory treatment&nbsp;order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is another role of the Mental Health Tribunal. It is important in determining the type of treatment, the rights of the patient as well as when the patient can be taken into&nbsp;a hospital against his will. Let us talk about the treatment. In light of the different possible treatments that a psychiatric patient can be subjected to, for example, electro-convulsive treatment (ECT) or neurosurgery for mental disorder (NMD), it is all <p align=left>Column: 81<p>the more important for the rights of the patient to be safeguarded. I think the Bill is not&nbsp;clear on this count. These provisions are not new and they are easily available. I rather not second guess the Ministry of Health's intention to deliberately leave this out but look forward to hearing from the Minister in his explanation.&nbsp;I also urge the Minister to consider taking the same approach of having a Mental Health Tribunal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major obstacle faced by mental patients is stigmatisation. To quote our distinguished Minister&nbsp;for Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, he said that it is as bad as the undesirable label given to ex-convicts. Like ex-convicts, mental patients may recover from their illness. Like any medical illness, they are mostly treatable with medicines or different types of psychotherapy. However, social stigmatisation has no cure. They tend to stem from ignorance, and sadly, there is a lot of ignorance surrounding mental illnesses. The findings of a recent survey support this generally accepted misnomer that mental patients are \"dangerous\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is further from the truth. The mentally ill are no more violent than those who suffer no mental illness. If you look at those persons who have committed the violent crimes, in fact, many of them are otherwise normal people with no mental illness. But Singaporeans are no different from many people all over the world in thinking that the mentally ill are dangerous people. We generally think that they are dangerous to normal people and, hence, need to be segregated. The myth that mental patients are prone to violence is probably perpetuated by the media. So this results in stigmatisation which is worse than the disease itself. Unfortunately, this Bill does not even attempt to deal with the terrible stigmatisation&nbsp;that mental patients have to bear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you another survey. In&nbsp;a recent survey in the United Kingdom <p align=left>Column: 82<p>Parliament, published in July 2008 by the Royal College of Psychiatrist, the survey covered 94 MPs, 100 Lords and 151 parliamentary staff in the UK. It is&nbsp;very telling of the downside of stigmatisation. The report&nbsp;conducted by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Mental Health showed that 27% of those surveyed had reported some form of personal experience of mental health problem. However, it is not surprising also to learn that one in three of them feared hostile public reaction which prevented them from being open about their mental health problems. British Members of Parliament stand to lose their seat for life if they are sectioned under the Mental Health Act for six months or more. While there is understandable reason for the British MPs to hide their mental health problems for obvious reasons, I think what is more important is that the social stigmatisation is also stopping them from seeking treatment. This is a big problem, if left unattended and will cost our society even more. So, therefore, we need to have public education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I acknowledge that it would be an uphill task to try and address the social stigmatisation issue but given the terrible cost we would have to bear, we need to deal with them head on. For starters, we could begin with&nbsp;greater public education on the ignorance surrounding mental illness. We need to inform the general public that mental illnesses are treatable. It is estimated that 1% of any given population may suffer from schizophrenia. Just now, Dr Lam also quoted a report in 2004&nbsp;which estimated that about 5.6% of our population suffers from depression&nbsp;and this will work out to&nbsp;about 240,000 of our population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the common problems among people with mental health problems is when&nbsp;it comes to applying for jobs. Usually, there is a column requiring them to declare whether they have any mental <p align=left>Column: 83<p>health problems.&nbsp;In dealing with my patients in a psychiatric clinic, I see that this is a constant struggle for many of them because I suspect that if they truthfully declare that they have some form of mental health problems, it is very likely that the prospective employers would not even consider shortlisting them for interview.&nbsp;This may mean that a quarter million&nbsp;people may lose their job or become unemployed. And also because of this stigmatisation, many people are not seeking the necessary treatment because if I go and see a doctor and I have been diagnosed as suffering from depression or schizophrenia, the label will stay with me. If I never see a doctor, I never know that I have this illness, I would never have to declare it. So it compounded the problem even more.&nbsp;I think we should educate our people to let them know that delayed treatment is not to our advantage. Early detection and treatment, like Mdm Halimah suggested, will help recovery and prevent illness from developing into a crisis. So I support the Government's efforts to engage&nbsp;a primary health provider&nbsp;for early identification and treatment of mental illness, and nipping it&nbsp;in the bud before it becomes more serious. It would go a long way to help us from engaging a bigger medical bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One common problem of people with mental illness is that mental illness is a chronic condition. Besides the right dose and right type of medication, the patient needs to be followed up&nbsp;regularly by the psychiatrist and be given support by a network of social workers and many other agencies. However, our experience shows that a significant proportion of the patients defaulted on the treatment for a variety of reasons after they are discharged. And what will happen is that they will relapse and often result in re-admissions. This is what we call a revolving-door syndrome.&nbsp;I think there is one way that we can avoid the revolving-<p align=left>Column: 84<p>door syndrome by introducing a community treatment order,&nbsp;as proposed by Mdm Halimah.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore, also urge the Ministry to ensure that&nbsp;patients get their regular follow-up and continue with their treatment after they are discharged from the hospital, and to provide for a Community Treatment Order to ensure continual treatment after they return back to the community. Both caregiver as well as immediate families have the responsibility to ensure that mental health patients continue with their treatment. The community support services also need to be beefed up as well. If the law fails to safeguard continual treatment and medication of the patient, the patient will be released soon after they show some sign of recovery, staying away from medication and, especially when the money is tight, they would relapse and revolve back, this time probably more serious than the last, to the hospital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Community Treatment Order, we must also ensure that there is a clear involvement of social workers and all the community support services.&nbsp;This is because many of our patients with mental illness also face a whole range of social problems when they attempt to reintegrate back into the society. Not only&nbsp;discrimination of jobs, they&nbsp;may also have problems of housing,&nbsp;family relationship and financial difficulties. Therefore, this multi-agency and&nbsp;multi-disciplinary approach is crucial in the long-term care of the patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to urge the Ministry to consider free continuous treatments for psychiatric patients. Because&nbsp;a recurring mental patient, is of little economic value to the State. It is of even little significance to his immediate family. In preparation for the play \"Off Centre\", Mr Alvin Tan of the Necessary Stage, interviewed some recovering mental patients, and reported that all did <p align=left>Column: 85<p>not want to reveal to him their occupation. They fear that if the truth comes out, they might lose their job. It is a fact that most employers are reluctant to employ people with mental illness. Mental patients would be even more resented by their family members if, in addition to losing their economic value, they are a financial burden to their family and that may prevent the family from wanting to support them for treatment. In this regard, I think we may be better off providing free treatment to these patients so that we can maintain them well in the communities, so that whether they can work or they cannot work, they have a more meaningful life without having to be re-admitted repeatedly&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it is like a revolving-door syndrome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with these comments, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.

The Bill is a farsighted move in drawing up a framework to provide clarity in the event of any legal disputes involving those who may be mentally ill, and in ensuring such patients are identified and given appropriate health care and attention.</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, to effectively provide support for the mentally ill, much more can be done. Although mental patients are able to turn to medical care from local hospitals and health institutions, they receive little in terms of social support.&nbsp; On the other hand, those who are suffering from physical health problems, such as cancer victims and the physically disabled, have the options of seeking medical and social assistance from welfare organisations that are established to take care of their ailments. This is a situation of disparity that needs to be addressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few welfare organisations cater to the needs of the mentally ill.&nbsp; I believe there are sub-specialties in counselling and that one who is trained in psychological counselling may not be suitable to handle cases that require someone trained in psychotherapy. Hence, though some volunteers are trained in counselling skills, this does not equip them to deal with a whole spectrum of cases including&nbsp;involving those who are mentally ill. We must be able to train our psychological counsellors in the community to identify mental health patients and refer them to trained mental health professionals.&nbsp; Presently, in the community, there are very few trained mental health professionals.&nbsp; We need to speed up the effort to encourage this pool of professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to increase the awareness that mental health can improve with prompt treatment, as in the case of cancer.&nbsp; More often than not, mental patients find themselves in the dilemma of <p align=left>Column: 87<p>whether to seek medical treatment or not.&nbsp; Some may find medical fees unaffordable. Some do not recognise the severity of their symptoms. Yet others keep mum about their predicament and avoid the hospital for fear of negative labels. Worse will be those who turn to pseudo counsellors who mislead them, and strip them off their life savings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they are receiving treatment, they also require support to get their life back on track. So we need to organise strong support groups in the community to give post-treatment support. This is where I urge the Government to look into training a talent pool of perhaps volunteers by giving them opportunities&nbsp;to undergo basic training in areas that are pertinent to understanding and&nbsp;supporting mental illnesses.&nbsp; I think this is especially so for family members because they are caring for the patients day and night.&nbsp; Personally, when I was young, I was living,&nbsp;for a short period, with a mental patient and it was really very torturing and&nbsp;very hard on the family to care for the patient day&nbsp;and&nbsp;night.&nbsp; At times, when there is no medication,&nbsp;either&nbsp;because there is no financial support or&nbsp;the patient refuses to take the medication,&nbsp;the patient&nbsp;goes on a cyclical mood.&nbsp; And that is where aggressiveness comes in, there is a real need for community support in terms of even police intervention, and&nbsp;this is where I feel that even the Police could be involved in certain areas as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, special attention needs to be given to the elderly, who constitute a large group among those with psychological problems. Last year, suicide rates among those aged 65 years and above took a leap from 69 in 2006 to 87. A large number of these suicide cases may be attributed to psychological issues. Training for counsellors to handle this group should also include lessons in local dialects so that they can communicate <p align=left>Column: 88<p>with the elderly, most of whom do not&nbsp;speak Mandarin, for example. This will also enable volunteers to become confidant to the elderly and alleviate their loneliness.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I urge the Minister to look into how we can prevent people from abandoning the mentally-ill at the hospitals or institutions. Given modern technology, we should impose a system whereby the next-of-kin, guardian or family members must be tracked&nbsp;so that they&nbsp;look after these patients. Without family support, their chances of recovery and returning to society would be worse.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Kalyani K Mehta--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.36 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Kalyani K Mehta:</B> <p>Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir for granting me permission to speak on this Bill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, one in six persons suffers from some form of mental health problem. While the current percentage of 16%-18% is lower than many developed societies&nbsp;like USA, where the corollary is 26%, the finding from the National Mental Health Survey has propelled the Ministry of Health to carry out a Blueprint or Master plan for the next&nbsp;five years. The introduction of this new&nbsp;Bill which replaces the earlier Mental Disorders&nbsp;and Treatment Act 1985 has been long overdue. For far too long we have devalued people with mental illness, and there has not been proper protection, whether medical or legal, of mentally ill persons. Stigmatisation of people who belong to this category was prevalent in the past as seen in the derogatory reference to Woodbridge Hospital as the 'mad persons' hospital.&nbsp; Even today, a person with a history of mental ill health would have difficulty in seeking employment.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To illustrate, allow me to describe an empirical study conducted in Singapore by a Master's level Social Work student from <p align=left>Column: 89<p>National University of Singapore. He found that schizophrenic patients were so afraid of being identified by their employers as being mentally ill that they religiously kept their appointments with their doctor, and were conscious of taking their medicines as prescribed. Hence, they lived in fear of being disclosed, and instead of advocating for better treatment by society, they kept their shroud of secrecy to hold on to their jobs. A similar study using similar research instruments, found that in contrast to the Singaporean patients, their American counterparts were more active in advocating for themselves, and did not live in fear of being identified as mentally ill. One positive outcome identified by the researcher was that Singapore patients tended to be more compliant as far as medication is concerned as compared to their American counterparts!&nbsp; The study made me wonder whether we could work towards a situation when schizophrenic sufferers would feel accepted by society and have a positive rather than a negative motivation to comply to medication.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last&nbsp;10 years, the legal sector has made some progress in their recognition of the needs of the mentally ill when they appear in court. Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, who introduced the Community Court in June 2006, introduced relevant policies as to how the mentally ill and disabled should be tried in court.&nbsp; His progressive thoughts in this arena are commendable.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Bill is comprehensive in that it deals with the apprehension, treatment, removal and transfer from a psychiatric institution; maintenance and liability, punishment for offences against mentally disordered persons as well as for improper detention of them. It is more reactive and protective of the physical well being of the mentally ill.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the following concerns about the Bill.</p><p align=left>Column: 90<p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, not enough attention is paid to the psychosocial treatment of the abuser after he or she has been fined and punished for ill-treatment and/or neglect of the mentally disordered person.&nbsp; Just as we have mandated counselling for the domestic violence abuser, similarly, informal and formal caregivers may also need counselling and support to improve themselves&nbsp;or even show remorse for their past deeds.&nbsp; Caregivers, who have intentionally or unintentionally neglected or ill-treated the mentally disordered person, usually have been burnt out by the stress of caregiving which could have been for lengthy periods,&nbsp;eg, 20 or even 30 years.&nbsp; They need help too.&nbsp; In order not to overstretch the manpower of the Medical Social Services Departments, such abusive caregivers could be referred for counselling at the Family Service Centre nearer their homes.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second concern is that mentally ill persons may be detained or institutionalised against their will.&nbsp; The reasons for detention have to be the health and safety of the mentally disordered person as well as the safety of other persons.&nbsp; The period of detention should not exceed&nbsp;six months.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp;for Health whether there will be a channel for review of detention.&nbsp; Are there plans to develop a Code of Practice to guide any family members who may wish to seek a review of the detention order? &nbsp;To whom should such a request for review be directed?&nbsp; For comparison purposes, the British have developed a document titled \"Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards\" or DOLS&nbsp; in June 2008, which provides such information. It is reasonable for concerned family members to seek a review and they should be entitled to a full explanation, as mentioned earlier by my honourable colleague, Mdm Halimah.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another related third concern is that of inadequate manpower to cope with the <p align=left>Column: 91<p>additional clientele in psychiatric institutions. With the broader powers assigned to police officers for the removal of mentally disordered persons, it is to be expected that the numbers admitted to the psychiatric institutions will increase dramatically. If the population of allied health workers such as counsellors, medical social workers and psychologists does not commensurate&nbsp;with the expansion of services, we could face insurmountable problems. I would like to ask the Minister for his plans on the rapid expansion of the sector of allied health professionals such as nurses, psychologists, medical social workers, counsellors, and the like. If our local expertise is inadequate, will our dependence on foreign labour be accelerated as a result?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a well-thought-out strategy to introduce the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Bill and the Mental Capacity Bill together as they deal with connected issues. The Singapore Government is to be applauded for taking the issues of the mentally ill and disabled very seriously. It is not only imperative politically, but also morally and philosophically, for a government to support its marginalised populations and facilitate their growth and protection. By example, our Government is giving the message that the mentally disordered persons deserve a better deal in life, and better services, which they may have been deprived of either by choice or circumstance. The inspection of psychiatric facilities by a Board of Visitors every three months is also necessary to maintain the institutions' high level of quality of care.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a broader level, we need more evidence-based research to identify the causes for the rise in mental illness in our population.&nbsp; Does the Ministry have any plans for conducting such research?&nbsp; If yes, can the Minister please elaborate?&nbsp; Prevention is the better route, both <p align=left>Column: 92<p>economically as well as in terms of productivity; some forms of mental disorders are hereditary and it is hoped that our Singapore Genome Project may help in future to curb such sources of mental illness. Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is one such mentally debilitating disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080915/20080915VS_115827.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I>*.]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, mental disorder is one that is not easily detectable.&nbsp; According to my understanding, even the doctor and psychiatrist agree that two doctors will never get the same diagnosis for a psychotic patient.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how does MOH define mental disorder.&nbsp; For instance, making gestures in public, making indiscreet remarks, sloppily dressed, or scolding people for no reason &ndash; is this considered a case of a mentally deranged person? The person might not have vandalised, or hurt anyone. However, a mentally deranged person can vandalise public property, he cannot refrain from dangerous behaviour, and can inflict harm on another person. But according to the proposed amendment, the police officers will only transport the mentally deranged person to the hospital for treatment in the event a member of the public lodges a complaint. But members of the public are usually not proactive and they will not call the police.&nbsp; If these psychotic patients are not treated in time, their illness will get worse.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I propose that we empower our police officers with the authority that in the event they encounter mentally deranged persons, they can \"invite\" them to the hospital for examination.&nbsp; If the patients&rsquo; condition is not too serious, the family members can take care of them, make sure that they receive treatment periodically, so as to prevent it from worsening. For those with a critical <p align=left>Column: 93<p>condition, the Government should make it mandatory for them to receive treatment.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is facing a greying population, and we know that dementia is one very common case of mental disorder.&nbsp; If you have watched Jack Neo&rsquo;s movie \"Money No Enough II\", in one part of the movie, the elderly mother has dementia and she repeatedly asked her son, \"Have you eaten?\".&nbsp; This has caused misunderstanding between the mother and son, and we can see that dementia has similar symptoms as that of mental disorder.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister, under the proposed changes, will there be any negative impact on the elderly who have dementia?&nbsp; My worry is that some parents might abuse the system and they get the police officers to send their old folks for examination, or compulsorily admit them into psychiatric institutions.&nbsp; This may cause family discord and could be detrimental to our Government&rsquo;s family policy. In this regard, how can the Ministry ensure that all these dementia elderly are not treated as psychotic patients?<br></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 173-174.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.48 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me thank Members for rendering their support to this Bill. &nbsp;Members have spoken very passionately on this subject and I have noted all their feedback and suggestions.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted by Members, mental disorder covers a very wide range of mental illnesses, and that is why most legislation, including ours, have to define \"mental disorder\" very widely.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah, Dr Ong Seh Hong and, just a while ago, Mr Ang Mong Seng seem to prefer a clearer, presumably, tighter definition.&nbsp; But the objective of this Bill is to ensure that those mentally ill patients who require <p align=left>Column: 94<p>institutionalised psychiatric care are accorded prompt treatment.&nbsp; Not all mentally ill need to be institutionalised.&nbsp; In fact, only a small minority do.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Dr Lam highlighted this point a while ago.&nbsp; So all patients have to be assessed and a medical judgement made.&nbsp;&nbsp;We think this is best achieved by allowing the attending doctor to make such an assessment rather than trying to hard-wire the various possible mental disabilities into the legal definition.&nbsp; But because mental disorder covers a wide range of mental illnesses, the stereotype image of the mentally ill is most unfortunate, incorrect, unfair and unhelpful.&nbsp; A senior doctor once commented, probably half in jest, that to different degrees, we are all mentally ill.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he probably meant it quite seriously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that most mentally ill patients can carry on a productive life, especially if they comply with the doctor's medical prescription.&nbsp; They do not need to be institutionalised.&nbsp; Even for the small minority who require institutionalisation, extended institutionalisation is now the exception rather than the rule.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;the result of better medical knowledge and advancement in mental healthcare.&nbsp; Unfortunately, society's perception of the mentally ill remains largely archaic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by Dr Ong Seh Hong, a recent study by IMH found that more than one in three Singaporeans believed mentally ill patients to be dangerous.&nbsp; About half of the respondents felt that the public should be better protected from people with mental health problems.&nbsp; The stigma runs deep, as noted by several Members.&nbsp; The majority of the respondents believed that mental health problems could afflict anyone, including themselves.&nbsp; But about half would not want anyone to know about it, if they were to suffer mental health problems, and that is why many continue to delay treatment to the detriment of their own health.&nbsp; And this is not unique to Singapore.&nbsp; Dr Ong quoted a <p align=left>Column: 95<p>similar study in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; So, clearly, we have much to do.&nbsp; We have to work harder to correct the misperceptions,&nbsp;destigmatise mental illness, promote mental health and ensure that the patients receive prompt care in the appropriate setting, whether it is in a hospital or in a community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah, Mdm Cynthia Phua and Dr Ong highlighted the benefits of educating the public about mental health.&nbsp; I totally agree.&nbsp; Early treatment and detection aid recovery and prevent the illness from getting worse.&nbsp; These are the issues&nbsp;we need to address through community-based mental healthcare programmes.&nbsp; Medical experts agree that community-based care is the way forward in improving the standards of care for the mentally ill by focusing on rehabilitation and integration of the patient into society as far as possible.&nbsp; There is evidence to suggest that aggressive community management of persons with mental illness can result in improvements in the quality of life, greater acceptance of treatment and reduction in hospital readmissions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, my Ministry launched a five-year programme to help enhanced mental health.&nbsp; So we are now into year two.&nbsp; There are four key thrusts&nbsp;&ndash; improve public education on mental health, develop community-based mental healthcare services, increase manpower and enhance research capabilities in mental health.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are all on the same wavelength here, based on what Members have spoken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two-thirds of the fund would seek to expand the community's resources for persons with mental illness.&nbsp; This includes developing partnership with GPs, community mental health teams and integrated medical psychological teams.&nbsp; The community mental health teams <p align=left>Column: 96<p>target four significant groups - school-going children, adolescents, adults&nbsp;and the&nbsp;elderly.&nbsp; They provide clinical services which include diagnosis, treatment and support to persons with mental health conditions in the community.&nbsp; They also provide training to front-line staff in a community agency as well as carers,&nbsp;a point raised by Mdm Cynthia Phua.&nbsp; The targeted agencies include eldercare services, VWOs, grassroots organisations and schools to teach them to detect possible mental health problems in their clients and educate them on the follow-up steps that they should take.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early detection and intervention programmes ensure that persons who have just developed mental disorder can reintegrate into the community as soon as possible.&nbsp; With good clinical care and strong support in the community to ensure good compliance with follow-up treatment and rehabilitation, the mentally ill in the community can be managed much more effectively.&nbsp; About $18 million is set aside for public education to increase awareness of Singaporeans about the importance of mental wellness and what they can do to maintain it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all things,&nbsp;a preventive approach is best.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we wait until it is too late, it is really too late.&nbsp; We can try to remedy and rectify, but it is never satisfactory and full recovery is almost impossible.&nbsp; The Health Promotion Board will implement its health promotion activities across a variety of settings, such as schools and workplaces, targeting Singaporeans at various stages of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mdm Halimah and Dr Ong that society needs to help the mentally ill in many areas, including trying to secure employment.&nbsp; IMH has a job club programme to facilitate the employment of persons whose mental disorders have stabilised by providing rehabilitation and skills training.&nbsp; I believe strongly in this, but I know how uphill the task is.&nbsp; I have looked at the&nbsp;\"Yellow Ribbon\" programme <p align=left>Column: 97<p>which tries to help the ex-convicts&nbsp;secure jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It started off difficult, as usual.&nbsp; But after 10 years,&nbsp;it had achieved quite good results.&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenged our people in IMH and the Ministry of Health&nbsp;to try to do something similar,&nbsp;though knowing that getting employers to accept ex-convicts is&nbsp;probably&nbsp;easier than the ex-mentally ill;&nbsp;a lot has to do with&nbsp;social stigma,&nbsp;which many Members&nbsp;have talked about.&nbsp; Society tends to generalise that all mentally ill are&nbsp;identically of the extreme, when in fact these are the small minority.&nbsp; Many can be stabilised and rehabilitated and can function like you and me.&nbsp; So we need the support of many to make this work, ie,&nbsp;employers, fellow employees, family members, community rehabilitation organisations as well as agencies like the Workforce Development Agency (WDA) and CDCs.&nbsp; Through these initiatives, we seek to train more GPs to better manage their mentally ill patients, avoid hospitalisation, reduce length of hospital stay, increase public awareness of the importance of public mental health and knowledge of coping strategies as well as improve the level of functioning of the mentally ill patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mdm Halimah and Prof. Mehta that we need to ramp up our manpower in a big way to support mental healthcare.&nbsp;We need many more trained professionals who can manage persons with mental illness effectively.&nbsp; Mental health or psychiatry has now been incorporated into the basic training of medical doctors, nurses and therapists.&nbsp; We support post-graduate training and specialisation in mental health for healthcare professionals through training awards&nbsp;and&nbsp;scholarships.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Members noted, there are now 116 registered psychiatrists in Singapore.&nbsp; Too few!&nbsp; We have to ramp up the number.&nbsp; I am quite glad to note, just before coming here, that right now,&nbsp;we have 50 trainees in the pipeline.&nbsp; We are definitely going to increase the number to at least 200 by <p align=left>Column: 98<p>2015.&nbsp; It can be done.&nbsp; If we need to augment with foreign recruits, we would do so.&nbsp; This would raise the psychiatric population ratio to about 4:100,000&nbsp;&ndash; still low compared to many other countries, but a significant improvement compared to today.&nbsp; But we have to take a multi-disciplinary team approach, relying not merely on psychiatrists.&nbsp;&nbsp;$15 million has been set aside to develop mental health manpower through the training of nurses, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, medical social workers and many more, as noted by Mdm Cynthia Phua.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mental health scholarships, awards and other skills development opportunities are also being offered.&nbsp; GPs can do more, as our key partners in managing patients with more stable and less severe mental illness in the community.&nbsp; Hospitals are training our GPs and engaging them in close working partnership to deliver continuing mental healthcare in the community.&nbsp; A new graduate diploma in psychiatry for GPs will also be launched.&nbsp; The family medicine training programme which prepares our young doctors to become GPs now includes a core posting in psychiatry.&nbsp; That probably helps explain the big increase in the number of trainees in psychiatry.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Prof. Kalyani Mehta asked about clinical research.&nbsp; Yes, this is also an area of emphasis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the five-year programme funding, a small though significant&nbsp;sum is set aside for research,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 99<p>to particularly pay attention to applied research;&nbsp;how we can reduce hospitalisation stay, how we can avoid re-admissions to hospitals, and&nbsp;other related areas.&nbsp;

Let me now address some specific queries on the Bill.&nbsp; Dr Lam asked whether non-psychiatrists, including potentially untrained junior doctors, may sign the orders to detain patients for care and treatment.&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; Clause 2 of the Bill states that only a doctor working in a psychiatric institution and who is designated in writing by my Ministry may sign such an order.&nbsp; And, obviously, we would only authorise doctors who are competent and have been properly trained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Members were concerned about patients being subjected to unnecessary or prolonged detention.&nbsp; This is a valid concern.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Dr Ong called for a Mental Health Review Tribunal to hear appeals by patients and their families.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked for stronger protection of a patient from the arbitrary exercise of the power of detention, now that it has been increased.&nbsp; Dr Lam asked if there is a maximum period of which a Magistrate may order a patient's detention.&nbsp; Let me clarify that, as compared to the current Act, this Bill does not increase the power of detention or the length of time for which a patient may be detained.&nbsp; On the contrary, this Bill is to reduce the power of detention.&nbsp; The maximum period of detention, for example, is now halved.&nbsp; Let me stress that not all mentally ill patients can be detained by us.&nbsp; We must fulfil two conditions:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 100<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; That his condition requires in-patient treatment.&nbsp; If he does not require in-patient treatment, there is no reason to exercise this Act; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; That detention is necessary in the interest of his own health and safety or for the protection of other persons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, both criteria must be valid before we can exercise this power.&nbsp; And there are checks and balances in place to ensure there is&nbsp;no abuse.&nbsp; For instance, the need for detention is reviewed regularly by a multi-disciplinary team treating the patient, as well as by the Visitors Board.&nbsp; The Visitors Board comprises lay persons and doctors who are not working at a psychiatric institution.&nbsp; As an added safeguard, applications for detention of up to 12 months at a time can only be made by these external visitors, after reviewing the institution's report and personally inspecting the patient.&nbsp; The visitors' application is then carefully scrutinised by the Magistrate who then decides whether to make such a detention order.&nbsp; Apart from these safeguards, applications may be made to the High Court for a review of any detention to challenge the lawfulness of a detention.&nbsp; Once a patient is assessed as no longer posing a danger, he will be discharged from detention immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this is not a new power, let us see what has been our actual experience.&nbsp; Last year, for example, IMH had more than 3,000 admissions under the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act.&nbsp; But of these, only five cases required further detention beyond one month.&nbsp; In fact, only 5% of these cases require detention beyond three days.&nbsp; So, the bulk of the detentions&nbsp;are for less than 72 hours.&nbsp; A Magistrate's Order for extended detention is&nbsp;also rare.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the current measures are adequate, based on&nbsp;actual experience.&nbsp; We will study best practices overseas to <p align=left>Column: 101<p>see whether additional safety nets, such as the tribunal that Members mentioned about, should also be put in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will keep an open mind on this particular issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah expressed concern that a reduction in the minimum frequency of visitor inspections might affect the protection of patients.&nbsp; Let me assure this House that the protection for detained patients will&nbsp;not be compromised.&nbsp; The amendment refers to the minimum frequency of visits.&nbsp; So it does not prevent visitors from conducting more frequent checks.&nbsp; We have added a provision which allows the Director of Medical Services to order additional visits if he deems necessary.&nbsp; The visitors can also make surprise random checks at any time.&nbsp; The visitors have a comprehensive list of tasks to perform whenever they conduct an inspection.&nbsp; Besides inspecting the institution, they also have to carefully review the overall well-being of the detained patients through observations and interviews.&nbsp; In addition, they need to evaluate patients detained by court order under the Criminal Procedure Code, make recommendations on patients' fitness for discharge from detention or from a remand to an open ward.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Mdm Cynthia Phua spoke on continuing care for psychiatric patients after their discharge from hospitals, and this is clearly necessary.&nbsp; Last year, my Ministry provided about $7 million of subsidies to support such long-term care for psychiatric patients.&nbsp; This will not be sufficient, going forward.&nbsp; Our approach is to ensure that a wide range of community-based services are available to help these patients.&nbsp; We will invest more resources to expand the sector as demand increases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Dr Ong have asked us to study the feasibility of supervised community treatments.&nbsp; Mdm Phua also called on MOH to support the <p align=left>Column: 102<p>management of these patients in a much more aggressive way in the community, and we will try to be aggressive.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah referred this House to the New Zealand Mental Health Compulsory Assessment and Treatment Act.&nbsp; If a patient can be treated in a community and does not pose a danger, then he cannot be detained.&nbsp; Detention is a major step and that is why we set the threshold high.&nbsp; But countries, such as New Zealand, have gone further.&nbsp; Under the New Zealand scheme, two kinds of compulsory orders may be made.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is an in-patient order&nbsp;which is similar to our Bill, when detention and in-patient treatment are considered absolutely necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is community treatment order, where a patient can be adequately and safely treated on an outpatient basis and he is ordered to undergo treatment in the community.&nbsp; Mandatory community treatment is therefore a complement to compulsory in-patient treatment and an extension of legal coverage.&nbsp; It is not an alternative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry is committed to ensuring that patients with mental disorders are treated in the least restrictive way possible.&nbsp; Like any other illnesses, such patients and their families should be encouraged to seek help, whether in the community or in a hospital.&nbsp; Detention is really a last resort, when a patient poses a risk to himself or to others.&nbsp; Even when detention is necessary, there is a provision in the Bill to grant the patient leave from the institution.&nbsp; This is one mechanism to transit patients back to the community even before formal discharge, when the risk to themselves or the community is reduced.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our intent is clear.&nbsp; It is to shift the focus of caring for the mentally ill from the institution to the community.&nbsp; If a patient does not need to be detained, then <p align=left>Column: 103<p>we think it is best to emphasise voluntary treatment and community self-help, rather than resort to legal compulsion.&nbsp; That is why we promote voluntary community mental health treatment programmes rather than extend the law to make community treatment compulsory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I keep an open mind.&nbsp; We will closely monitor the progress, outcomes and the effectiveness of our own programmes and compare them with the experience in New Zealand and elsewhere.&nbsp; We can then decide if we need to extend the law to provide for community treatment orders.&nbsp; But, meanwhile, we step up and strengthen the community services.&nbsp; There is a gap and let us plug the gap first.&nbsp; We will think about the law later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked for MediShield to cover mental illness, while Dr Ong suggested that treatment be free.&nbsp; With Medifund, some mentally ill do not pay anything.&nbsp; So, it is free for them.&nbsp; But they have to be properly means-tested to avoid any abuse.&nbsp; MediShield does not cover mental illness because its premiums have not factored in such a liability.&nbsp; If MediShield is to cover mental illness, these premiums will have to be raised.&nbsp; But I have mentioned before that I&nbsp;keep an open mind on this particular idea.&nbsp; At some stage,&nbsp;when we are going to revise MediShield again,&nbsp;we can think about this particular idea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah was concerned that increasing the maximum penalty in clause 8 of the Bill will cause hardship for caregivers.&nbsp; Under clause 8(3), a police officer is empowered to visit and inspect a mentally disordered person to ascertain whether or not he is properly cared for or whether he is being ill-treated or neglected.&nbsp; A caregiver commits an offence only if he refuses to allow the police officer access.&nbsp; I believe it is <p align=left>Column: 104<p>necessary to enhance the penalty for such an offence so as to protect the patients in the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng was worried that family members may abuse the elderly with dementia by complaining to the police so that these elderly persons can be arrested and removed from their homes.&nbsp; If so, this will indeed be a very sad development for our society.&nbsp; The police will not detain any person indiscriminately based solely on complaints.&nbsp; They will conduct a thorough investigation and assessment of the situation.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the investigation turns out that the family members have ill-treated their mentally ill relatives&nbsp;&ndash; a scenario&nbsp;painted by Dr Lam just now&nbsp;&ndash; they would have committed an offence, not under this Bill but under the Penal Code, and will be taken to task.&nbsp; In any case, each case will have to be looked at individually and we should not jump to any hasty conclusion or moral judgment.&nbsp; It is easy for outsiders to criticise a family member living with a mentally ill 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&nbsp; As Mdm Halimah, Mdm Cynthia Phua and Prof. Kalyani Mehta have noted, sometimes the family members will need strong support and treatment too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked what constitutes dangerous behaviour, whether police officers are trained to handle persons with mental disorders and how they assess that a mentally disordered person is indeed dangerous to himself or others.&nbsp; Dangerous behaviour may include arming oneself with a knife or other sharp object, threatening others, or putting oneself in a precarious position, for example, climbing out of the window to stand on the parapet.&nbsp; In dealing with such situations, the police will bring the mentally disordered person into safe custody first before referring them to medical assessment and treatment.&nbsp; The police have proper procedures in place to handle such persons.&nbsp; These procedures will guide <p align=left>Column: 105<p>officers on the course of actions to take, to assure, to pacify and to persuade the person to go for medical treatment.&nbsp; Where force is required as a last resort, to disarm the person or to bring him into custody safely, these procedures further specify that such force shall only be sufficient to overcome the threat or resistance.&nbsp; In short, police officers do receive training in handling persons with mental disorders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng asked if the police can be more proactive in getting patients, behaving strangely before they become violent or dangerous, to seek treatment early.&nbsp; We certainly should try, whenever we come across such cases, to alert the medical officers and&nbsp;hospitals so that we can start early treatment or diagnosis.&nbsp; But I hope we can do it in a way which will not reinforce the flawed stereotyping of the mentally ill.&nbsp; Some of this social nuisance does not equate to dangerous behaviour.&nbsp; It simply means that the person is unwell</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Is he getting enough support and care from his family, compliant with his treatment or experiencing a relapse?&nbsp;Let us all, as family members, neighbours and fellow Singaporeans, lend a listening ear and a helping hand. Society can play a greater role in supporting the needs of the mentally ill. Police assistance can be sought, however, if the public thinks that the nuisance is persistent and it poses a danger to himself or others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank Dr Lam for expressing concerns about the welfare of healthcare givers working in psychiatric institutions but we are used to dealing with such occupational hazards. The IMH has a framework in place to deal with cases of assault on staff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 15(5) of the Bill allows the transfer of detained patients to&nbsp;another hospital for treatment of non-mental related illness. Dr Lam was concerned <p align=left>Column: 106<p>that the receiving hospital's facility might not be adequate. We will work with the hospitals to ensure that they have the necessary capacity and capability to manage these patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong highlighted the 1976 California Supreme Court ruling of <I>Tarasoff vs Regents of the University of California</I> and asked for a debate on this issue. While I agree that the California case threw up an important issue,&nbsp;I doubt this is the occasion to debate it. I do not think it is appropriate to legislate on a psychiatrist's duty of care towards third parties in this Bill. Without detracting too much from the debate on this Bill, let me just say that the doctor-patient confidentiality is fundamentally important but it is not absolute. There may be very compelling situations where countervailing public interests may justify disclosure. This is also recognised in the Singapore Medical Council's ethical code and ethical guidelines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will continue to work with other ministries and agencies on this nation-wide mental healthcare programme. My Ministry cannot do this alone. Under this programme, we will pro-actively care for patients&nbsp;across a wide spectrum of mental health conditions. The focus is prevention, early treatment for those who suffer from mental health conditions, get them back on their feet with continuing care in the community wherever possible.&nbsp;While the Government will work hard on this, the society at large has to work even harder on changing mindset, ie,&nbsp;employers, fellow employees, fellow Singaporeans, family members, neighbours. The mentally ill need our help, our sympathy, our empathy. Try to put ourselves in their shoes. If you continue to stigmatise mental illness, treat all of them like psychopaths, we will only make their conditions worse and their recovery more difficult.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, join Mdm Halimah, Dr Ong, Mdm Cynthia Phua and all the <p align=left>Column: 107<p>Members who have spoken, to appeal to all Singaporeans to join us to help these unfortunate patients. But for a small minority of these mentally ill, their psychiatric problems necessitate their involuntary admission, care and treatment in a psychiatric institution. This is to ensure their personal safety, health and to protect other persons in the community. Hence, we need this Bill and, once again, I thank the House for their strong support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Mr Khaw Boon Wan].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MENTAL CAPACITY BILL--><!--END_COL_TITLE:MENTAL CAPACITY BILL:::130--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 107<p><B>MENTAL CAPACITY BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.21 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Ms Indranee Rajah) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our population is ageing and with ageing, unfortunately, the rate of dementia will also increase. At the age of 65 years, one in&nbsp;twenty&nbsp;of us may have dementia. By the time we are 75 years old, the incidence could be as high as one in 10. Maybe&nbsp;I will use the numbers in the Chamber as an analogy. If this Chamber was full and all of us were past the age of <p align=left>Column: 108<p>75, there could be as many as nine persons who would have some form of dementia. I think it is just a coincidence that there will be nine speakers on this Bill!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we grow older and become frail, the fact is our dependence on other people will&nbsp;increase. In a</p><p>book entitled, <I>\"Tuesdays with Morrie\"</I>, the author Morrie Schwartz described this need quite succinctly. He says, and I quote, \"It's like going back to being a child again. Someone to bathe you. Someone to lift you.&nbsp;Someone to wipe you.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morrie Schwartz graciously accepted his need for others as his body wasted away from Lou Gehrig's Disease and&nbsp;he was unable to take care of himself.&nbsp; But sometimes, instead of the body wasting away, our minds may waste away first. And we may be unable to make decisions on our own and ultimately be unable to fend for ourselves. If any of us, unfortunately, was to reach that point, I am sure that we will feel much safer if we knew that the person whom we&nbsp;were going to depend on at that point in time was someone whom we had chosen&nbsp;when we had the capacity to choose&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;someone whom we could trust and rely on and someone who was willing to undertake that burden. The best time to choose that someone is now, before we lose our minds, before we lose our capacity. The question therefore is: can we do so under the current legal system? The short answer to that question is \"not quite\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, a Committee&nbsp;of Person or Estate may be appointed by the High Court to manage the personal welfare and financial matters of those with 'unsound mind' and who are deemed to be incapable of managing their affairs. This is provided for under the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act, an Act which&nbsp;Parliament has just agreed to repeal. However, the problem with this prevailing <p align=left>Column: 109<p>legislation is that the appointment of the Committee of Person or Estate can only be done after an individual person has lost his mental capacity. In other words,&nbsp;you cannot plan in advance and, even worse,&nbsp;you cannot exercise a choice.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am therefore introducing the Mental Capacity Bill to address this lacuna. We have studied the legislative frameworks of various countries, including&nbsp;the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and other countries closer&nbsp;to us in Asia, including&nbsp;Japan and Hong Kong. We have found the England and Wales Mental Capacity Act to be a comprehensive example, and we have modelled our Bill along their lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mental Capacity Bill puts in place a framework for proxy decision making. This framework sets out who can make the decisions on behalf of those who are mentally incapacitated, which includes persons with dementia, intellectual disabilities or&nbsp;brain damage. It also specifies the processes for doing so. Family members and caregivers&nbsp;who make&nbsp;decisions on behalf of those lacking capacity will be guided by this overall framework. And recognising that persons who lack capacity are specially vulnerable, this Bill provides safeguards against abuse by proxy decision makers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Public consultation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill is one that has taken a long time in gestating and it has been considered by staff in the Ministry of Law, Ministry of Health and the MCYS for almost a decade. Personally, it has been on my desk for almost three years and we consulted the public through a&nbsp;consultation exercise which began two years ago. So, we have taken our time to carefully and&nbsp;deliberately craft this Bill and make sure it suits our local conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consultation exercise included, in particular, consultation with social welfare organisations,&nbsp;legal, banking and medical <p align=left>Column: 110<p>sectors.&nbsp;I am very heartened that most Singaporeans and key stakeholders have welcomed the Bill as a timely measure in view of our ageing population and they have also provided useful feedback. We have evaluated all the feedback and we have also amended&nbsp;our original drafts so that we have&nbsp;come up with what I believe is a more appropriate Bill in its current form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would now like to draw the attention of the House to some of the main features of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Lasting Power of Attorney</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mental Capacity Bill will empower individuals to plan in advance. It creates a new statutory mechanism called the Lasting Power of Attorney (or&nbsp;LPA in short). With the LPA, individuals can&nbsp;choose, in advance, the person whom they would like to&nbsp;make decisions on their behalf, if and when they lose their capacity in the future. The designated proxy decision maker is known as the donee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LPA is a flexible instrument and individuals&nbsp;will be&nbsp;empowered to determine in advance the specific areas&nbsp;which their donee&nbsp;can make decisions for them.&nbsp; These areas may cover property and financial matters, as well as personal welfare matters, including healthcare matters. When the individual loses his mental capacity, his donee is sanctioned to make decisions on his behalf in the areas that have been pre-determined by the person.&nbsp; An individual&nbsp;can also&nbsp;appoint one or several donees who can act jointly or jointly and severally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Bill, we have provided that bankrupts will not be able to act as a donee for property and financial affairs. However, a person who is a bankrupt can act for personal welfare affairs. When we consulted the public on the exclusion <p align=left>Column: 111<p>criteria for donees, we received&nbsp;mixed reactions -&nbsp;some wanted us to be very safe and have a long list of exclusion criteria, yet, others said that these are personal decisions and we should let the&nbsp;individual decide&nbsp;who he or she&nbsp;wants to act as a donee, regardless of any previous convictions or financial embarrassment which an individual may be exposed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, we decided to take what we believe is the right balance between protection and choice and we decided that we would draw the line only on bankrupts insofar as property and financial affairs are concerned. We do not want to be overly prescriptive and we want to allow Singaporeans the maximum choice to choose someone whom they trust to be their donee. But I would emphasise that you should consider very carefully the overall circumstances of the person whom you are intending to make your donee and to confer a lasting power of attorney to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When individuals plan in advance, they may actually alleviate their loved ones of much stress later when they lose capacity. I will cite an example&nbsp;of one&nbsp;Madam Adeline Ang who&nbsp;is married with two sons. Some time ago, her husband was diagnosed with brain cancer, subsequently lost&nbsp;his ability to make decisions, and&nbsp;Madam Ang found that she then could not gain access to his bank account in order to even pay&nbsp;his medical bills. She was told she had to make an application to Court but she&nbsp;discovered that this process would be costly and sometimes cumbersome.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, she chose not to go to&nbsp;court but that meant she had to struggle even more, to look after the husband, to get the necessary resources and also to look after the children.&nbsp; We believe having a Bill like this which allows pre-planning and pre-designation will lighten the burden in a significant way for future families in such <p align=left>Column: 112<p> circumstances.&nbsp; But having said that, I also want to say that we will not mandate that everyone must make such a directive and conferring a lasting Power of Attorney to someone else.&nbsp; This will be entirely voluntary.&nbsp; We are merely providing individuals with the means to do so if they wish to and this, therefore, is the attraction of the Bill.&nbsp; It is empowering, it is giving you a choice, and it allows you to plan in advance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Court decisions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sometimes, there will be people who did not plan or deliberately did not want to plan and to appoint someone as a&nbsp;donee.&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a case, there is&nbsp;an option of applying to the High Court when that person loses capacity, for a court decision on the person&rsquo;s personal welfare or property and affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The High Court will have powers which are listed in the Bill to make decisions on the control and&nbsp;management of the mentally incapacitated person&rsquo;s property, carrying on the profession or business of the mentally incapacitated person and the execution, amendment or revocation of a will on behalf of that person.</p><p><br><I>Court made wills</I></p><p><I><br></I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allowing the High Court to make wills on behalf of a person who lacks capacity was a recommendation put up by the Law Society and one which I hesitated on initially.&nbsp; However, after consulting the experts&nbsp;involved&nbsp;in this field, I think this is something which we should provide for.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?&nbsp; When a person who has not made&nbsp;his will and then subsequently&nbsp;loses his capacity, and if he&nbsp;has got&nbsp;a fair bit of assets that need to be distributed, and where it is apparent from his circumstances that the distribution of&nbsp;the assets according to the laws of intestacy&nbsp;&ndash; that means according to circumstances where no will is made&nbsp;&ndash; <p align=left>Column: 113<p>would lead to inappropriate, unfair or unjust outcomes, then there is an advantage in allowing an application to the High Court for the court to step in and decide in an objective&nbsp;and fair manner as&nbsp;to&nbsp;how these assets should be distributed in the person&rsquo;s best interests,&nbsp;not necessarily&nbsp;in the best interest of the beneficiaries &nbsp; This, I believe, will clarify misapprehensions and prevent possible future&nbsp;disputes or tensions among family members.&nbsp; Family members can then focus on looking after the well-being of the mentally incapacitated person.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Deputies</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who have not planned in advance, and where there is a need for ongoing decisions to be undertaken, the High Court can also sometimes&nbsp;appoint a deputy for the person who lacks capacity. This system is not unlike the current Committee of Estate or Person which we have&nbsp;in today's legislative framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This provision would be particularly useful for parents of children with intellectual disabilities. Let me explain this in greater detail.&nbsp; Very often, parents who have children&nbsp;with disability, mental or physical, have expressed to me that their greatest anxiety is what happens&nbsp;after they pass on.&nbsp; Who will look after their child?&nbsp; Who will look after him when he reaches adulthood?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will take care?&nbsp; Who will make decisions?&nbsp; As a parent myself and, I think, as all of us here are parents,&nbsp;we can empathise with this great&nbsp;anxiety or fear of the future&nbsp;in such&nbsp;circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill would not be a panacea&nbsp;for their worries but it provides a framework which I believe will assuage some of their fears.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how this will operate. Parents can apply to the High Court to appoint a deputy for their child. In the case where the child has reached the age of 21, the court may make the appointment if at that point in time the <p align=left>Column: 114<p>child is deemed to&nbsp;lack the capacity within the meaning of this Bill.&nbsp; In the case where the child is not yet 21, the court may still&nbsp;make the appointment if it considers likely that the child will continue to lack capacity when he reaches 21 years of age.&nbsp; In appointing a deputy for&nbsp;the child who has not reached the age of 21, the court must have regard to the principle that&nbsp;the appointment of his parents or guardian is to be preferred. The court also has the power to appoint successor deputies in the event that the parents pass away.&nbsp; When considering who should be the successor deputy for a child who has not reached the age of 21 years, the court shall have regard to the parents&rsquo; wishes. In other words, the parents can indicate who they want to&nbsp;act as their successor deputy and the court will have regard to their wishes.&nbsp; This, therefore,&nbsp;establishes a succession pathway for the care of the child with&nbsp;intellectual disability and we will work to make this process as efficient and simple and as affordable as&nbsp;possible to all parents in such circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Safeguards and protection</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have shared with the House the avenues provided under this Bill to appoint a proxy decision maker, either a donee or a deputy.&nbsp; In addition to providing these&nbsp;avenues, the Bill also guides proxy decision makers in the discharge of their duties. Let me, therefore,&nbsp;elaborate on some of&nbsp;these provisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key principles</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the heart of the Bill is a set of key principles whose&nbsp;core tenet is that every individual must be presumed to have capacity unless shown otherwise. The Bill provides a two-stage test that must be applied in order to determine whether&nbsp;a person has the capacity to carry out an act or make a particular decision. It focuses on the particular time&nbsp;that&nbsp;the decision has to be made and on the <p align=left>Column: 115<p>particular matter to which the decision relates. This, therefore,&nbsp;allows the&nbsp;calibration of powers to be granted to appointed proxy decision-makers so that they will take into account, at all times, the extent of&nbsp;the person&rsquo;s mental capacity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;for those that lack capacity, decisions that have&nbsp;been taken on their behalf must be taken in their best interests. The Bill offers guidance on what constitutes best interests. One example would be in the case of making a decision with respect to&nbsp;the incapacitated person&rsquo;s property. The Bill states that where there is a need to dispose of or settle&nbsp;a person&rsquo;s property, the decision-maker must be motivated by a desire to ensure that the incapacitated person&rsquo;s property is preserved as far as possible to maintain the incapacitated person during his life.&nbsp; This is to avoid some of the conflicts of interest which inevitably arise in such circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Statutory protection for informal caregivers</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have provided for statutory protection for informal caregivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are people who are looking after people who are incapacitated but have not been designated formally as donees or deputies.&nbsp; As long&nbsp;as these informal&nbsp;caregivers perform&nbsp;acts&nbsp;in connection with the care and treatment of people with incapacity, in their best interests, and without negligence, then clause 7 of the Bill will provide these informal&nbsp;caregivers with protection against civil and criminal liability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This requirement, and I want to emphasise this requirement,&nbsp;to act in the best interests of the mentally incapacitated person and without negligence, is based on existing common law principles. Caregivers should be assuaged that they <p align=left>Column: 116<p>would not be &lsquo;criminalised&rsquo; nor face civil suits in their course of caring for the mentally incapacitated insofar that they were performing these acts of care and treatment in the best interests of the mentally incapacitated in good faith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Excluded decisions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Sir, there are some issues which we believe should be excluded and some decisions which proxy decision makers should not have a right to make.&nbsp; For instance, there are some decisions which are so sensitive,&nbsp;for example, the consent to marriage; consent to divorce; consent to sexual relations; sterilisation; adoption; renunciation&nbsp;of religion or change of gender. This Bill will also not affect the existing operation of the Human Organ and Transplant Act or the Advance Medical Directive (AMD) and where&nbsp;a person has already made an AMD, the AMD will prevail.</p><p><br><I>Criminalisation of ill-treatment</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am certain that the majority of us, if we are called upon to perform the role of a proxy decision maker, will do so sincerely and to the best of our ability but we should also be realistic and understand the vagaries of human nature.&nbsp; Some of us may have read in the&nbsp;newspapers, I think&nbsp;in May this year, of a wife who was appointed to the Committee of Person&nbsp;for&nbsp;her husband by the court.&nbsp; Her husband was incapacitated due to a work-related incident. She was appointed to manage the sum of money that was awarded to her husband as a result of the accident. I believe this was the Workmen's Compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us would have been appalled to read that not only had the wife pocketed the entire sum of money for herself, she also locked her husband up at home without care while she went on to live with another man.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to deter such flagrant cases of abuse as far as possible.&nbsp; As a bulwark <p align=left>Column: 117<p> against abuse, this Bill&nbsp;will introduce a new criminalisation clause. Ill-treatment or wilful neglect of a mentally incapacitated person will be a criminal offence. Any caregiver, donee or deputy found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment or a fine or both.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Office of Public Guardian</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will set up a new Office of Public Guardian. It will perform a range of functions that contribute to the protection of those that lack capacity. The Office will supervise and support court-appointed deputies.&nbsp; Families may approach the Office of Public Guardian for information on making the Lasting Power of Attorney as to&nbsp;what powers they could consider granting and what to consider when trying to choose who they want to act&nbsp;as a donee. We expect that the Office would be operational some time in the middle of next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy&nbsp;Speaker,&nbsp;we cannot stop the ageing process and we cannot stop the fact that some of us will lose capacity in the future.&nbsp; But this Bill is to empower us to plan in advance, to try in some significant way to secure peace of mind even if we were to lose our minds in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.42 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I may be getting old but I assure the Minister that I am not yet suffering from dementia.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;the Mental Capacity Bill is both timely and appropriate. Singapore is rapidly ageing. We are constantly reminded of the increasing number of elderly Singaporeans. With ageing, comes <p align=left>Column: 118<p>the reality that our mental faculty may not be as capable as before.&nbsp; For a fair number within our society there will come a time where they are no longer capable of assuming the mental ability and responsibility for their decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act (MDTA) is the only significant piece of legislation that deals with people who are mentally incapable of looking after themselves. And we have just only this afternoon repealed this Act but it will come back in a different form.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the MDTA was drafted more for those who are mentally unsound than for those who are mentally incapable, in law at least, of&nbsp;making proper decisions. Although the MDTA may be applied to those who lack mental capacity to look after themselves, to have decisions taken on behalf of those who lack the capacity under the prevailing legislation may not always be appropriate, as the application of the Act carries with it the potential stigma, as we have heard earlier, of being labelled as insane by the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The present Bill, therefore,&nbsp;fills a gap in the legislation.&nbsp; It also simplifies and makes it possible for us to plan ahead to prepare for the day we no longer are able&nbsp;to&nbsp;make sensible decisions. With the passing of the Bill, Singaporeans can now draw up instruments in the form of Lasting Power of Attorney, or can now take comfort in the prospect of a court appointed Deputy who can eventually make decisions in their best interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore,&nbsp;applaud and welcome such moves by the Government to attempt to bring back some dignity in the lives of those who cannot look after themselves.&nbsp; However, I do have a few concerns that I hope Minister can shed light on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be ideal for one to plan ahead to draw up Lasting Power of Attorney but <p align=left>Column: 119<p> I am not sure if the majority of Singaporeans will fully appreciate the benefits that this legislation seeks to bring to them. I suspect that as with wills and testamentary dispositions, most Singaporeans would either be ignorant of the matter, or will not appreciate it sufficiently to want to bother. Besides, even if they are prepared to draw up such an instrument, we may not have the right people who are sufficiently informed of their rights and obligations in duty to properly discharge their functions as guardians of such mentally incapacitated people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of a Lasting Power of Attorney, concerned parties, as we understand,&nbsp;may still apply to court to get&nbsp;an order to appoint a Deputy to act on behalf of the person concerned.&nbsp; However, unless that person is a man of means, few would ordinarily want to take the trouble of making an application to court to get a Deputy appointed in the absence of a Lasting Power of Attorney.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who will bear the cost of such application?&nbsp; The fact remains that a person who lacks the mental capacity to make decisions would have to rely on his family for his daily needs. What he may not be able to do, unless he has made prior arrangements, is to have contractual dealings with other parties.&nbsp; In many cases, families may just wait till the person passes away before dealing with his assets and properties. The prospect of going to court to make an application in most cases would just put many Singaporeans off.&nbsp; Unfortunately, unlike estate matters where properties of the deceased may be applied for the benefit of the beneficiaries, including the administrator, there may be fewer incentives for anyone to apply to court to act as a Deputy as there are added impositions on the person concerned without the obvious benefits.&nbsp; Sir, if the Act is to achieve the broader purpose for <p align=left>Column: 120<p>which it was designed, it should be made more friendly and less costly to implement and has a wider reach to all and sundry rather than just be confined to a few.&nbsp; What we certainly do not want is a legislation that is confined to the middle class and the well-heeled Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, much authority has been given to the Attorney or the Deputy in a court appointed case. These powers are wide ranging.&nbsp; Potentially, these persons may make decisions that harm the person concerned although these decisions are ostensibly made in his best interest.&nbsp; The Bill presently disallows persons who are bankrupt from acting on behalf of the incapacitated person in certain matters.&nbsp; However, the Act is silent as to persons with past record of criminal convictions, particularly those who have been convicted of violent or sexual crimes, fraud or dishonesty.&nbsp; I note that the Public Guardian, together with the Board of Visitors, is supposed to provide supervisory guidance on the conduct of the Attorney, which, for the purpose of my speech, also includes the Deputy appointed by the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question really is, whether this is sufficient to safeguard the interest of the person concerned.&nbsp; The Bill seems to be saying that a bankrupt is more dangerous than a convicted fraudster or a violent criminal.&nbsp; This seems like an anomaly and is rather presumptions.&nbsp; A person could be bankrupt for various reasons.&nbsp; However, the law unfortunately makes the presupposition that all bankrupts cannot be trusted to act in the best financial interest or property interest of the person who is mentally incapacitated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the Bill entrusts the Attorney to behave properly in discharging his duties under the appointment.&nbsp; Currently, otherwise determined by the authorities, the law allows the Attorney to deal with the property and affairs of the incapacitated person.&nbsp; Such acts will be binding on the person whom the Attorney <p align=left>Column: 121<p>represents. While the Bill makes provisions for the oversight and supervision by the courts, the Board of Visitors and the Public Guardian, there should be rules to spell out the specific areas that these guardians should look out for.&nbsp; For instance, the Bill is silent on the question of whether or not, in the discharge of his duties, the Attorney ought not to be placed&nbsp; in a position where he is in breach of his fiduciary duty to the incapacitated person.&nbsp; As to what the nature of that fiduciary duty is, as I said earlier, or what is the nature of the conflict that the Attorney should not put himself into a position is very much dependent on the knowledge and maturity of the Attorney concerned.&nbsp; In this regard, I am not sure whether all who will be appointed Attorneys under a Lasting Power of Attorney will properly and fully appreciate the responsibilities that he now has to shoulder for his loved ones whom he&nbsp;is giving continuing care for.&nbsp; I do understand that under the present regime as proposed, there is a provision for the Code of Practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would like to urge the Government that in drawing up&nbsp;a detailed Code of Practice, the Government would take into consideration a very detailed set of guidelines that will&nbsp;guide and supervise the Attorney or perhaps the Deputy in the discharge of his duties towards the incapacitated person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in its implementation, much will have to depend on the public to have the good sense to know that delegating the authority to someone to make decisions on their behalf under certain circumstances is a very important and serious exercise.&nbsp; Much of his quality of life will depend on the Attorney to properly discharge his duties and to have the wherewithal to discharge it.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the introduction of the Bill is welcome as it provides a&nbsp;proper platform that is convenient and efficient in dealing with mental incapacity than that which is currently available.&nbsp; However, this is also one Bill that would require much public <p align=left>Column: 122<p>education and training if it is to be effective.&nbsp; I do hope that in this regard, the Government will put in place resources to properly and adequately prepare the public for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Madam, I support the Bill.<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.50 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I will speak in Mandarin.<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>In Mandarin</i>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;</I> <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080915/20080915VS_121709.pdf\"\"><I>Appendix A</I></a> <I>*.</I> ]&nbsp;The introduction of the Mental Capacity Bill is indeed timely as we anticipate and prepare for the imminent challenges of an ageing population coupled with longer life expectancy.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the draft Bill was circulated for discussion, many groups of people from various non-governmental organisations&nbsp;and self-help groups were consulted.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.53 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Mental Capacity Bill and thank the Minister for this significant legislation.&nbsp; If executed well, this new Bill will make a real positive difference to many lives.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will speak on three key points: (1) responses to the Bill;&nbsp;(2) its positive features; and (3) provide three suggestions for implementation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The response to the Bill is mixed.&nbsp; One, professionals, especially the social service, legal and healthcare sectors, generally welcome the new Bill as it provides a comprehensive framework that reforms and updates the current Mental Disorders and Treatment Act (MDTA).&nbsp; The current Act is limiting in its scope and does not allow persons to plan in advance for a time when they may lose their <p align=left>Column: 124<p>mental capacity.&nbsp; Two,&nbsp;parents of special needs or disabled children appreciate the new Bill and thank the Ministry for this.&nbsp; In a 2006 Parent Workgroup Report on enhancing the financial security of persons with special needs, close to 100 parents and disability experts were engaged.&nbsp; The families' key fears were grouped into two main areas, namely, (1) financial and (2) caregiving arrangements when they are unable or&nbsp;no longer around to look out for their special needs children.&nbsp; And, three, other Singaporeans who either do not have or do not want to rely on their children and wish to plan in advance for their old age, I believe, also embrace the new Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for the man in the street, the content of the Bill does not appear to be their concern.&nbsp; At&nbsp; a recent dialogue with my residents and grassroots leaders, I learnt that there is even concern that planning too early will (1) disrupt harmony amongst their children, and (2) encourage the abdication of filial duties of adult children who are not \"appointed\" to make financial and personal welfare decisions when their elderly parents lose their capacity.&nbsp; Hence, for&nbsp;the typical Singaporeans, there is a need for the Ministry to educate them so they can&nbsp;make informed options, instead of relying on their potentially false confidence that things will fall into place when the time comes or as the Chinese call this attitude, \"<I>chuan dao qiao tou zi ran zhi</I>\", or as the song goes, \"<I>que sera&nbsp;sera</I>, whatever will be will be\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the new Bill is based on the British Mental Capacity Act passed in 2005 and came into force in 2007, Singapore is in a fortunate space to not have to reinvent the wheel.&nbsp; Positive new features were introduced in this new Bill.&nbsp; The Bill is comprehensive and protective of the person lacking capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new positive features of the Bill include the Lasting Power of Attorney <p align=left>Column: 125<p>that the Minister spoke about, a new regime for the appointment of a Deputy and even Successor Deputies for the person lacking mental capacity and the creation of the new Office of Public Guardian and Board of Visitors with accountabilities to safeguard the persons lacking capacity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Bill is comprehensive and its authors took care to protect the person lacking capacity.&nbsp; Concerns raised in the UK experience were considered and, I believe, one of which was that lacking capacity need not be total and some people may lack capacity only in regard to some areas.&nbsp; For example, some people with disability may have no problems deciding what to eat and where to live but maybe unable to decide best on matters related to property and finance.&nbsp; Hence, the laudable provision of the Bill that persons participate as much as possible in any decisions made on their behalf.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent abuse, limitations were also imposed on&nbsp;the powers of the Deputies and donees in matters such as the making of gifts, execution of wills, key decisions like sterilisation and the carrying out of life-sustaining medical treatment.&nbsp; These are good news and good features.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to move next to the point of similarities between the elderly and the disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same new Bill are provisions addressing what appear to be similar needs of the elderly and the \"disabled\".&nbsp; Both the elderly and the younger disabled at some time in their lives need someone to make decisions on their behalf and to look out for them and to look after them.&nbsp; The key difference is the time that it happens, the elderly are likely to take a longer time to reach the point of need but many elderly people do become less able and disabled at some stage.&nbsp; As the Minister had alluded to, we have nine people potentially in this House who could be afflicted with dementia.&nbsp;&nbsp;I <p align=left>Column: 126<p>believe that it is not just dementia we are talking about.&nbsp; Everyone in this House is potentially disabled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, indeed, the sooner we can see that some needs of the \"disabled\" and the \"elderly\" are not all that different,&nbsp;the sooner we can \"mainstream\" policies and services for the \"disabled\" in areas such as healthcare, employment, workfare, Medisave top-ups, MediShield, ElderShield scopes and coverages, tax reliefs for dependants, public transport and even housing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it may be appropriate to even suggest that the Office eyeballing the needs of the elderly is also appointed to look into the needs of the younger disabled and identify common needs and strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been said that behind every glamorous vision are a million plodding steps that need to be taken before the vision becomes a reality.&nbsp; Indeed, legislation alone is not sufficient and must be supported by practical guidelines and other initiatives to ensure that the Bill, if and when it is passed, does not become a white elephant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2008-9 business plan of the UK Office of Public Guardian speaks of the reality of execution difficulties of the Mental Capacity Act, and I quote, \"The implementation of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 in UK and the establishment of the Office of the Public Guardian is an ongoing challenge\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore ask the Minister&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

consultation in developing the Code of Practices;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp; mass communication and education; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 127<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp; integration of other pieces in a master plan for the elderly and the disabled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the Code of Practices is a critical document provided in the Bill to provide further guidelines and illustrations on implementation of the Act.&nbsp; In the UK, this document issued by the Ministry of Justice is 302 pages long.&nbsp; I am not certain that the Singapore equivalent needs to be that long.&nbsp; However, I believe that time and resources must be applied to ensure that there are careful consultations during the drafting of the Code of Practices.&nbsp; This is to ensure that it is localised to our Singapore conditions and understood by all stakeholders, not just attorneys and lawyers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, a loss of capacity can be caused by an array of conditions, such as psychiatric illness, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, brain injury, learning disability and other neuro-developmental problems.&nbsp; In drafting the Code of Practices, medical and disability experts, social workers and so forth must be included to provide expert inputs to assessments of capacity and for appropriate care plans for the persons affected.&nbsp; Crucial dialogues must be held.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the Bill provides for a framework that is flexible and intended to be so, to ensure that individuals can participate as much as possible and to cover a range of possible scenarios for decision making, there is a real need for clarity for the purpose of day-to-day implementation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we mean, for example, by terms such as \"all practicable steps\" in clause 3, \"best interest\" in clause 6, \"minimum level of restraint\" in clause 8, \"reasonable price\" in clause 9, and&nbsp;\"reasonable expenses\" in clause 24?&nbsp; All <p align=left>Column: 128<p>these in practice need clarification and guidance for those implementing the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A comment often overheard regarding the Bill is that whilst it is a very good idea in principle, how will the Bill or the Act later become public knowledge and be understood and applied?&nbsp; Out of the 10 professionals whom I have sent the proposed Bill to last week, only one lawyer could fully comprehend the terminology, proposed features and&nbsp;implications of the Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, propose the development of a Communication Matrix that lists target groups according to their income and language proficiencies; how and where these target groups receive information; and matching communication strategies so that&nbsp;many people who need to can easily access the information needed to plan for their own futures and know where to get help.&nbsp; Communication has to go beyond the usual brochures, media releases and cartoon illustrations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The Ministry has been proactive in recent years to address the needs of the ageing population and those who are at risk, eg, the disabled and the lower-income group.&nbsp; Many of us in the sector are encouraged and grateful by initiatives, such as:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Council for Third Age;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Enabling Master Plan for the Disabled;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Trust Company for the Disabled;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Financial Literacy campaigns;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; ComCare Funds for the needy;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; Community Foundations; and several others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Bill cannot operate in a silo if it is to make a difference.&nbsp; There is a need to integrate the many pieces of effort and <p align=left>Column: 129<p>provide a clearer roadmap for Singaporeans planning for their future.&nbsp; Take, for instance, the Bill presupposes that there are sufficient financial resources available for persons to plan the future.&nbsp; But findings of the October 2006 AXA survey of 10,000 Singaporeans showed that most people do not have sufficient&nbsp;to retire and, in fact, have a \"worrying disconnect with reality\", as far as the resources they have for retirement&nbsp;are concerned.&nbsp; This lack of preparedness is further compounded in families with disabled children and, worse, in lower-income families with severely disabled children.&nbsp; The current \"que sera sera, whatever will be will be\" attitude towards the future is a potential time-bomb for a rapidly ageing population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, I would like to urge the Ministry to take the lead to integrate the many piecemeal initiatives to help Singaporeans, especially those who are ageing and/or disabled, to be more prepared for their future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop a more user-centric, not agency- or Ministry-centric, map of services for easier navigation, so that those who are more able can equip themselves to make more informed choices for themselves for their future.&nbsp; The same map can be used by the appropriate Helping Hands in society to identify, eyeball and support those who are at risk due to their lower income or education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us also continue to learn from others who have walked the journey before us in the UK, Scotland, Germany, Japan and the United States.&nbsp; In the UK, for instance, the Office of Public Guardian has already been set up with its own business plans and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).&nbsp; We can avoid any potential pitfalls while localising our practices to align with our own Singaporean culture and values.&nbsp; We can <p align=left>Column: 130<p>even contribute, as we learn, to&nbsp;a bank of best practices to carers and practitioners in the rest of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I would&nbsp;like to again&nbsp;thank the Minister and his team for this significant legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:EXEMPTED BUSINESS:::130--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debate resumed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.06 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Madam, as mentioned by the Minister in his Second Reading speech, the Bill was modelled after the UK Mental Capacity Act 2005.&nbsp; I have done a comparison with that UK Act and I noted that there were some interesting departures from the UK model on which I would like to ask the Minister for some clarifications.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first concerns the Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) which confers powers on the donee to deal with the property of the donor who is called \"P\" in the Act.&nbsp; Clause 14 allows a donee to make gifts out of P's property.&nbsp; Since the gifting will be done while P is alive, the donee should act conservatively so as not to deplete P's property which can be used for P's healthcare and other needs.&nbsp; However, there is no mention in the Bill about who the donee can make gifts to or for what <p align=left>Column: 131<p>purpose.&nbsp; In contrast, the UK legislation specifies that gifts should be made by the donee only on customary occasions, eg, anniversaries or birthdays, and to persons related or connected to P, or to charities as P would have done.&nbsp; Is it not prudent that we should similarly write into the Act the conditions under which the donee can make gifts on P's behalf?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the next few issues relate to the role of the court under the proposed Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I note that, in the UK, a special court of protection&nbsp;is set up to handle applications under the Mental Capacity Act.&nbsp; This clearly signals the protective function of the courts in such applications, and will develop judicial expertise and smooth interfacing between the court and social agencies involved in such matters.&nbsp; By contrast, the Bill provides for such applications to be heard in the High Court, presumably by generalist judges.&nbsp; Did the Government consider the benefits of setting up a special court instead?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, under clause 23(1), the court can make certain decisions on P's behalf, including the execution of a will, which the Minister touched on earlier.&nbsp; While I note that the UK provisions also have this provision, I have some discomfort over this as my question is: when would it be right to execute a will on behalf of P?&nbsp; People die intestate every day, as mentioned, and the rules of intestacy will apply to distribute property to family members in a certain default order.&nbsp; On the other hand, if there had been a will previously executed by P while he had capacity, it should not be easily rewritten.&nbsp; People are entitled to make quirky decisions on their own property.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, the Minister mentioned that the re-execution of the will or the <p align=left>Column: 132<p>execution of the will by the court will be made in the person's best interests and not in the beneficiary's best interests.&nbsp; I wonder if he could clarify this statement further, because the will only kicks in when the person is dead.&nbsp; So, it obviously has to be made in the interests of the beneficiaries.&nbsp; Will we have a case where the court is substituting its own judgment as to what is a fair distribution of property and taking that away from P?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the UK Act provides for a service called the Independent Mental Capacity Advocates (IMCA) service for persons who are mentally incapable and may not have next-of-kin or appointees.&nbsp; These independent advocates are provided by the state and function as independent persons to watch out for P's welfare when he is faced with two types of decisions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) whether to undergo serious medical treatment; or</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; whether to effect a change of accommodation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an advocate would support P in various ways.&nbsp; For instance, he would look at the options available, ascertain what P's feelings and wishes are likely to be, and work collaboratively with the healthcare professional or administrator before decisions are made.&nbsp; Since there is nothing in the Bill about this, would the Minister like to explain how this gap will be closed?&nbsp; For instance, if there is a destitute dementia patient with no family, how would his interests be protected?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, the Bill also gives the Public Guardian very wide powers to ask for information and documents, for example, under clause 32.&nbsp; Under the UK Act, the kinds of documents that the Public Guardian can call for are health, social records and care records.&nbsp; By contrast, our Bill does not limit the power to any particular class of documents.&nbsp; It is further <p align=left>Column: 133<p>provided that the Public Guardian is to be given \"full and free access\" to buildings, books, papers and electronic records.&nbsp; These powers seem very draconian.&nbsp; The only people exempted from compliance are lawyers who need not disclose confidential client information.&nbsp; What about others with duties of secrecy, for example?&nbsp; Are we now to assume that P's bankers are required to disclose information about P's property without any court order?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Madam, the Public Guardian's annual report.&nbsp; Clause 34 requires the Public Guardian to present his report to the Minister&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;presumably the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports&nbsp;&ndash; but not to Parliament.&nbsp; Under the UK law, the Public Guardian presents his report to the Lord Chancellor who must, within one month, lay the report before Parliament.&nbsp; I wonder why the Minister does not adopt a similar disclosure of the report to Parliament.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.12 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the Bill.&nbsp; I apologise for my lack of voice.&nbsp; I am down with a flu.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first declare my interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, I was a member of a sub-committee of the Academy of Law chaired by a High Court&nbsp;Judge, which recommended extensive changes to then Mental Disorders and Treatment Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a vast improvement over various provisions of the old Mental Disorders and Treatment Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most significant change is the recognition of the concept of limited incapacity, ie, that while an individual may lack the capacity to make some kinds of decisions, he may well have capacity to make others.&nbsp; The old Act did not make that distinction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, an application under the old Act to appoint a Committee of Estate or Person required a finding that the subject <p align=left>Column: 134<p>was &ldquo;unsound&rdquo; and incapable of managing his affairs.&nbsp; That was because the old Act was based on the English Lunacy statutes, which have long since been repealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, applications under this Bill will not carry the same stigma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also applaud the&nbsp;introduction of the Lasting Powers of Attorney as this&nbsp;enables individuals to have as much say as possible over their own welfare and property even after they no longer have capacity to make decisions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, let me touch on some technical aspects of the Bill and seek some clarifications.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the issue of abuse and publicity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 38(2), and&nbsp;save for a narrow class of persons set out in clause 38(1), any person may apply to appoint a deputy over another person with the permission of the Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, any application under the Bill, even one for permission to apply, may cause embarrassment to the subject and his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the application may be reported by the newspapers using their right to report on judicial proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, while a frivolous application will no doubt be dismissed by the Court, the damage from the adverse publicity to the subject and his family may already be done.&nbsp; I therefore believe it would be preferable for any application for permission of the Court under clause 38(2) be heard in camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will protect the subject and his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the application for permission has merit, the main application can be heard in open court consistent with the principle of open justice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, there should be&nbsp;stricter rules relating to those who apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the applicant should be made to declare if there are any conflicts or facts relating to him which may make him <p align=left>Column: 135<p>unsuitable to be appointed&nbsp;a deputy, eg,&nbsp;where he has previously been made bankrupt or convicted of any offence involving dishonesty or sexual misconduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not provide for any obligation to disclose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, there should be greater supervision of the appointed deputy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24(10) provides that the Court may require the deputy to submit to the Public Guardian such reports as the Court may direct.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill should make clear that, unless the Court otherwise directs, such reports should include regular medical reports on the subject person.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a change in the subject person&rsquo;s health, the deputy&rsquo;s appointment may no longer be necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;But where the deputy finds himself in an advantageous position, he may be reluctant to give up his appointment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Guardian may&nbsp;not have the resources to supervise or scrutinise each case.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be prudent&nbsp;to allow an&nbsp;independent third party, such as a doctor, to have regular access to the subject person to ensure that his interests are being taken care of and there is a need to continue the appointment of the deputy.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

There is already a provision under clause 32(1) which gives the power to the Public Guardian to require any person to deliver&nbsp;any information or documents under the pain of penalty.&nbsp; So what is the purpose of these wide powers under&nbsp;clause 32(4) and (5)?&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is any suspicion of criminal offence, the Public Guardian should enlist the assistance of the police, and the provisions relating to search and seizure under the Criminal Procedure Code <p align=left>Column: 136<p>will apply.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no suspicion of any criminal offence, it is difficult to see why the Public Guardian requires such wide powers under clause 32(4) and (5).&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if necessary, such power should only be exercised with the leave of the Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I have some concerns with respect to clause 32(9).&nbsp;&nbsp; This provides that clause 32 shall not compel a professional legal adviser to disclose or produce any privileged communication made by or to him in that capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This recognises the principle of legal privilege and the importance of preserving the confidentiality of privileged communication.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are, however, two problems with clause 32(9).&nbsp; First,&nbsp;the common law definition of legally privileged information does not just include communication made by or to the professional legal adviser.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why therefore have that qualification?&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Minister confirm that the exception under clause 32(9) will apply to all&nbsp;communications which the common law regards as privileged?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the privileged communication on document&nbsp;will in all likelihood also&nbsp;be in the possession of the client.&nbsp; But the Bill only gives protection to the legal adviser from disclosure.&nbsp; The Bill, therefore, suggests that the client is required to produce all legally privileged materials in his possession.&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, that undermines the fundamental basis of legal privilege.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify whether this is the intention of the Bill?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, and in conclusion,&nbsp;this Bill&nbsp;has wide-ranging&nbsp;implications.&nbsp; It is a good Bill and&nbsp;Singaporeans and others&nbsp;should be made aware of the various avenues available to them to help manage the personal and property affairs of those who are mentally incapable.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I share the call of the MPs before me that the Ministry devotes enough resources to educate Singaporeans on this law.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Kalyani K Mehta--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 137<p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>6.18 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Kalyani K Mehta:</B> Thank you, Mdm Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Mental Capacity Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It symbolises the determination and the concern of the Government to protect the interests of persons who lack the capacity to make decisions for themselves due to, I quote,&nbsp;\"impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain.\"&nbsp; Importantly, an assessment by a certified medical practitioner is required to establish that the individual lacks capacity. &nbsp;In Singapore it has been documented that there are 22,000 persons suffering from dementia, and each year 7,000 are diagnosed with the disease. (This is from a <I>Straits Times'</I> report \"Alzheimer&rsquo;s set to grow with ageing Singapore\", 22nd September 2007). With an ageing population, this group of dementia patients will definitely grow, and their welfare has to be protected, as the Minister has described earlier.&nbsp; On the other hand, the lifespan of mentally disabled persons is also increasing.&nbsp; Hence, we face the future scenario of a sizeable sector of older people, who are likely to be neglected or abused, unless individuals are empowered by state legislation to do proper planning.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill addresses the difficult question that troubles many elderly:&nbsp;how can I ensure that good and proper care will be exercised if and when I am not capable of deciding about my own medical treatment, day-to-day decisions, financial matters or even housing?&nbsp; The Bill provides for the nomination of a donee (or donees) in an affordable way, through the Office of the Public Guardian.&nbsp; The Bill clearly spells out the limitations of the donee&rsquo;s power as well as age, ie, minimum 21 years.&nbsp; The donee cannot change the will, Advance Medical Directive, or CPF nomination made earlier by the donor.</p><p align=left>Column: 138<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are safeguards in place to limit the lasting Power of Attorney of the donee as well as the deputy, who is appointed by the court if a certain situation requires the appointment of a deputy.&nbsp; To carry out the work spelt out in the Bill, the Minister would appoint the Public Guardian as well as the Public Guardian Board.&nbsp; To assist the work of the Public Guardian, a Board of Visitors would also be appointed.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to mention some of my concerns and recommendations, which I hope that the Minister&nbsp;for Community Development, Youth and Sports will consider.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, for the establishment of whether a person lacks capacity, it is stated in&nbsp;clause 2 that,&nbsp;\"it does not matter whether the impairment or disturbance is permanent or temporary\". &nbsp;This means that, at the moment in time when the assessment is done, if the donor was in a momentary unstable state, either due to effects of stress or depression, the potential donee could take over his financial/property/personal welfare/housing decisions if he/she has been nominated at an earlier period.&nbsp; I think that it would be better if the medical practitioner suspects a temporary unstable state, the donor could be brought back for a second assessment perhaps a week later.&nbsp; A family physician who knows the donor well may \"smell\" something suspicious and may not be comfortable with immediately classifying the donor as mentally incapable.&nbsp; Through my conversations with GPs I have learnt that they find this task of assessment quite &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; in terms of the responsibility they are required to undertake. Such an option of a second assessment would allay the anxiety of medical practitioners, in cases of doubt. Tom Kitwood, a well-known British psychology expert on dementia, has written in his book titled,&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Dementia Reconsidered\", about physical conditions that can have side effects that 'mimic' dementia. Some of these physical <p align=left>Column: 139<p>conditions are confusional symptoms that accompany or follow pneumonia, delirium, chronic infections such as that of the urinary system, and even inadequate nutrition over a lengthy period.&nbsp; I would add that the stigma and shock that accompany the diagnosis of dementia, especially Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease for the patient and his family members, deserve a second assessment, whenever some doubt exists in the doctor&rsquo;s mind.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second,&nbsp;clause 42 refers to ill-treatment and/or neglect of the donor by the donee or deputy appointed by the court.&nbsp; As it is not uncommon in wealthy families for one sibling to be jealous of another sibling, and in order to inflict punishment, may argue that \"emotional injury\" has been inflicted upon the donor by his/her sibling donee.&nbsp; The motive could be revenge.&nbsp; Another scenario could be that in the course of the duty of care, the donee may have just uttered once a negative complaint of the aggressive behaviour of the donor.&nbsp; Does this constitute ill-treatment? &nbsp;The clear definitions of ill-treatment, injury and abuse should be set out in the Bill or in the Code of Practice so that all parties concerned are clear and room for maneuvering is diminished.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would request the Minister to assure the House that in the implementation of this aspect of the Bill, extra caution and professional assessment be exercised in the process, so that family caregivers would not be discouraged from taking on the roles and responsibilities of a donee.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the current Singapore Mental Capacity Bill has many similarities with the British Mental Capacity Act (2005) as my earlier colleagues have mentioned.&nbsp; Since then the UK has adopted the Code of Practice in April 2007 and subsequently the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards in June 2008.&nbsp; Since there is <p align=left>Column: 140<p>a reference to a Code of Practice under&nbsp;clause 41, I would like the Minister to inform the House when can we expect the Code of Practice in Singapore&nbsp;to be ready and available for the public and professionals to use?&nbsp; I am especially concerned that when this Bill comes into effect, if the Code of Practice is not ready and available, those professionals who have the \"duty of care\" towards the mentally incapable will face many problems in explaining to the public and informing them about the meaning and the reach of the Mental Capacity Bill or Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UK website of the Office of the Public Guardian is very informative and the Code of Practice carries relevant examples to enlighten the public.&nbsp; I urge the Minister to look into the possibility of such information being easily accessible in Singapore, as the baby boomer generation would make full use of it. The list of certified medical practitioners who are trained to do the assessments of mental incapacity should also be posted on the website.&nbsp; Some of this information could be posted in different languages on the website as well as flyers and posters on public notice boards.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the Bill does not specify the qualifications needed for a deputy to be appointed by the court. In my view, there should be a short but comprehensive training provided to the deputies, as the kinds of issues they are likely to face could be highly complex, and not just legal.&nbsp; A reasonable amount of time should be&nbsp;given to the deputy to complete his or her investigations, as quality could be compromised in the name of efficiency.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a final note, I would like to enquire from the Minister whether he has any plans to assist those families whose aged relative may already be diagnosed with dementia and they&nbsp;have legal and financial problems that require the application for a Lasting Power of Attorney. Currently, the <p align=left>Column: 141<p>family would have to approach a lawyer and incur heavy costs in order to obtain an LPA.&nbsp; For these families, the Mental Capacity Bill has come too late, as it were. Perhaps, the MCYS could set up a team of <I>pro bono</I> lawyers who could assist such average or low-income&nbsp;distressed families to deal with the problems faced.&nbsp; My conversations with service providers on the ground has indicated that this is a gap in the current provision of social service delivery that should be looked into, in the same spirit that the Mental Capacity Bill is being seriously considered today in front of us.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Madam, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>6.28 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of this Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill provides a statutory framework to protect vulnerable people, caregivers and professionals.&nbsp; It makes it clear who can take decisions in which situations and how they should go about this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current law is restrictive as it lacks sufficient safeguards to protect those who lack the mental capacity to provide for their needs.&nbsp; The ambit of the current law, which covers only mentally disordered persons who are of unsound mind and incapable of managing himself or his affairs, excludes those who may be mentally sound but are incapacitated for a variety of reasons such as old age or sickness.&nbsp; The Bill provides a wider coverage.&nbsp; It provides all persons who lack capacity because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain. What is more important also is,&nbsp;unlike the old Act, the Bill covers functional incapacity as it talks about a person who lacks capacity in relation to a matter \"if at the material time he is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to that matter\".&nbsp; This is in contrast to the <p align=left>Column: 142<p>old Act which talks about a person \"being incapable of managing himself or his affairs\" which suggests that the Act could kick in only if there is general incapacity, that is, the person is incapable of totally handling himself in all regards. So, this Bill&nbsp;is certainly an improvement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are a couple of points in this Bill&nbsp;for which I would like to&nbsp;seek clarifications from the Minister, particularly to ensure that there is adequate protection for the person who is mentally incapacitated.&nbsp; First, could the Minister clarify whether the existing definition of what constitutes the best interests of a person lacking in capacity is sufficient to protect his interest?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ensuring that whatever is done is in the best interests of a person is a key element of this Bill to prevent abuse, exploitation and decisions adverse to the person lacking in capacity. Section 6 elaborates what must be taken into account in order to determine what is in the best interests of the person. However, this definition is not too&nbsp;clear. A patient&rsquo;s interest is reduced to the subjective \"wishes and feelings\" of the patient. No mention is made of the need to take into account interests in relation to the life and health of the patient. While&nbsp;these are&nbsp;not the only aspects of a person&rsquo;s welfare, life and health&nbsp;are certainly important aspects that should have been stipulated in the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp;could the Minister clarify whether there are sufficient safeguards to protect the interests of the person who lacks capacity, particularly in relation to the extensive powers given to those appointed under the Lasting Powers of Attorney? The Bill gives significant powers to proxy decision makers and grants them legal status in the context of healthcare. There are, however, risks in giving such powers to those not medically qualified who are not like doctors held accountable for medical negligence, and who may even have a conflict of interest such as a financial expectation on the <p align=left>Column: 143<p>patient&rsquo;s death. As presently drafted, the Bill gives proxy decision makers power without too much&nbsp;accountability. At the very least, there needs to be a prescribed duty of care and accountability in law for decisions taken by the donee in a Lasting Power of Attorney. The donee should be required to give due weight to a patient&rsquo;s health interests, and not simply to the patient&rsquo;s desire expressed at some earlier time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, I join the hon. Member of Parliament, Mr Sin Boon Ann, in asking the Minister whether he could clarify why the Bill prohibits an undischarged bankrupt from being appointed as a donee of a Lasting Power of Attorney in relation to a person&rsquo;s property and affairs but allows someone who has been convicted of fraud, theft, misappropriation or criminal breach of trust to be appointed as a donee of a person&rsquo;s property and affairs. If the prohibition on undischarged bankrupts holding office as donees is because of the fear that they might be tempted to abuse their position by dipping into the coffers of the person lacking mental capacity, would not that same concern apply to those who have criminal convictions for theft, fraud, CBT or misappropriation? In fact, people can be made bankrupts for so many reasons and some of it may not even be due to their lack of integrity, as in the case of someone who stood as a guarantor for a friend who subsequently disappeared leaving him saddled with the debt, or someone whose business failed despite his best efforts and who lost a considerable amount of his own savings. Are these people who became undischarged bankrupts more reprehensible than or even as reprehensible as someone who has been repeatedly convicted and jailed for theft or other crimes related to property? If bankrupts are excluded, could the Minister clarify why these other convicted criminals are not similarly excluded? Likewise, could the Minister <p align=left>Column: 144<p>clarify why sexual offenders are not excluded, an important consideration, in my view, particularly if the person who lacks capacity is a woman?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Madam,&nbsp;could I also join the others in asking the Minister what steps will be taken to educate the public on the contents of this Act, eg, their rights to appoint the Lasting Powers of Attorney or to get appointments of the deputies.&nbsp;This is not a simple Act to understand but it benefits members of the public&nbsp;considerably.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.34 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mdm Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill, whose main purpose is to provide a legal framework to enable a person to voluntarily make advance plans for his own financial and personal&nbsp;affairs should he lose his mental capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Mental Capacity&nbsp;Bill also criminalises ill-treatment and wilful neglect of mentally incapacitated people.&nbsp;With the rising number of older people and&nbsp;an ever rising incidence of dementia, I think we need this Bill.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This law does not deal with a remote possibility but a real eventuality.&nbsp; According to Alzheimer's Disease Association Singapore, there were 20,000 people with dementia in 2006 and in 12 years' time, this number will balloon to 50,000.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my house-to-house visits to the HDB rental blocks in my ward, where the residents are mostly poor, I have come across elderly parents who are in financial hardship and still willing to look after their mentally-ill children.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their love is truly unconditional.&nbsp; They see their children not as burdens to be borne, but treasures to be cherished.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I have people coming to my MPS asking for their <p align=left>Column: 145<p>mentally or physically ill parents or relatives to be put in nursing homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;They say they cannot take care of their mentally or physically ill parents or relatives due to work commitments or family problems.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it is easy for us to condemn this behaviour, to say that the children ought to behave better.&nbsp; But, first, let us take the log out of our own eyes, before we can see better, to take the speck out of this group of people.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day to day, if we have to take care of someone who cannot control his toilet, who dribbles when he eats, who goes missing due to failing memory, it will strain our patience and drain our emotions, especially if that someone is a doddery old man or old lady, rather than a plump new baby.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, there is no warm glow of romance and sentimentality in old age for some Singaporeans.&nbsp; Too many of us can justify putting our older relatives in homes with all kinds of reasons, such as we need to work to provide for the children.&nbsp; We need to have time for ourselves.&nbsp; The old folks would be happier in nursing homes because there would be nurses taking care of them.&nbsp; They would also have friends there.&nbsp; They would have regular excursions and outings.&nbsp; They would not notice where they are, actually, since they have dementia, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we were to ask the older people&nbsp;&ndash; would they prefer to be in their own homes? Almost everyone would say yes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <I>&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This law does not prevent people from taking the easy options of putting older people in nursing homes.&nbsp; But it does make sure that those who have the capacity and the means, will be able to dictate how they want to be taken care of, in the dark days when they can no longer make the decision themselves. Hence, I do hope that all of us can take a little time to <p align=left>Column: 146<p>reflect on this, and make advance plans for ourselves. This is a little like making a will&nbsp;&ndash; to prepare for an eventuality that we would rather not think about, but it is far wiser to spend a few&nbsp;hours or even days&nbsp;going through the process than have our families face all the difficulties from our inaction now.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come to something that is&nbsp;harder to do. This law gives us some black and white in our society.&nbsp; But laws cannot regulate private behaviour.&nbsp; It cannot force people to take what are ultimately private decisions.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall some of the debate that went on in this House, when we first thought of legalising the need for children to take care of their parents&nbsp;&ndash; it ended up in the passing of the Maintenance of Parents Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is harder to regulate such things as filial piety but we have&nbsp;managed to do&nbsp;so.&nbsp; In the last two years, the Tribunal for Maintenance of Parents had received 870 reports of children not supporting their parents.&nbsp; It is a tangled web of name calling, of failed duties and recriminations&nbsp;&ndash; but the law gets the job done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or does it?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know of the unequal burdens borne by some offspring who provide more for their parents than their siblings.&nbsp; We also know of the many nieces and nephews who are paying for the old person&rsquo;s stay at a nursing home, if their cousins do not ante up.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know of the grudging payments, the shame of elderly parents begging for money from their sons and daughters.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Mental Capacity&nbsp;Bill will not prevent any of these private sufferings and humiliations.&nbsp; It will merely ensure that the public conform to the barest minimum.&nbsp; But that is the role of laws in a society and the rest is up to the private individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 147<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what lies before us today is not an amendment to an existing policy but a moral choice.&nbsp; This debate is not about neglect or ill treatment.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, indeed, about our providing for how we want to be treated when we ourselves can no longer know how we are being treated.&nbsp; It is also about how we can become criminals if we do not treat those who are mentally ill well. In short, it is about how we should act, and how we want others to act, when no one is watching.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moral values and conscience are the best care for our elderly who are no longer able to care for themselves.&nbsp; Unfortunately, values and conscience cannot be shaped by the laws.&nbsp; Hence, we need to go beyond this Bill to care for older people who have lost their mental capacity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have the Second Reading of this Bill today.&nbsp; And I support this Bill because it shows&nbsp;what we stand for as a society.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having put the Bill in place, I would say that our next duty is to make sure that the law is used as it is intended.&nbsp; To achieve this, we need to educate our children, by our own behaviour to our parents, and by our compassion to fellowmen.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a story in India which is as old as time.&nbsp; It is about a coconut shell and this is how the story goes.&nbsp; When a man turns old, he becomes useless and cannot contribute to the family.&nbsp; So, his son does not allow him to eat with the family.&nbsp; The old man is given a coconut husk and told to sit outside in the wind.&nbsp; He is not allowed a room in the house but given an old cloak against the storm when he sleeps outside.</p><p align=left>Column: 148<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the old man dies. His son wants to throw away the coconut husk.&nbsp; \"But wait!\" a little boy cries. \"Why? Grandpa is dead, we don&rsquo;t need this anymore,\" says the man to his son.&nbsp; \"I want to keep it,\" says the boy. \"What in the world for?\" asks the man, amused.&nbsp; \"So I can give it to you when you grow old,\" says the boy.&nbsp;This is when the penny drops.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I must quickly add that we need to teach our children to be sensitive to this call of conscience for the right reason.&nbsp; We treat our parents well, not because we are afraid of being given the coconut husk one day, but because it is the right thing to do.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent Jack Neo&rsquo;s movie, there was a scene where a filial son was persuaded by his family that it is the \"kinder\" thing to send his ageing mother to a nursing home.&nbsp; No laws against that, but his conscience would not&nbsp;allow him to&nbsp;do so lightly.&nbsp; Those who have watched this part of the movie will have a heavy heart like mine. The old woman has clearly not lost any of her mental capacity, but the way she was treated was clearly not in line with her wishes. Her problems, like that of many other ageing people in society, are clearly more complex than can be wished away by a new Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, we have many challenges to tackle in the road ahead, as more of us become older and some of us&nbsp;become mindless.&nbsp; The law is our ally in making sure that the worse does not happen.&nbsp; However, to be the best that we can be, we need a moral voice and a strong conscience which can only be upheld by Singaporeans ourselves, not the laws.&nbsp; Hence, we need to do more in our classrooms and our homes on moral education.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Speaker, with that, I support the Bill.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Some&nbsp;Members have also asked&nbsp;relevant questions on the safeguards provided by this Bill and also&nbsp;the way we will implement them.&nbsp; And the fourth group of questions and comments were with respect to execution&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I think that is one of Ms Denise Phua's favourite words, \"execution\"&nbsp;&ndash; insofar as public communication, the formulation of the rules of court and the Code of Practice are concerned.&nbsp; So allow me to attempt to respond.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect that I may miss out a few points but&nbsp;Members can always raise them later if Mdm Deputy Speaker allows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let us look at the similarities and differences between the Bill that we have put before this House and what the UK has enacted.&nbsp; First, the key similarities.&nbsp; Our definition of \"mental capacity\" is the same.&nbsp; Our approach to providing statutory protection for caregivers is also the same.&nbsp; We have the same concept of payment for necessary goods and services, except, in the case of Singapore, I restricted it a little bit so that, unlike the UK system, donees cannot use the incapacitated <p align=left>Column: 150<p>person's assets to be pledged as credit.&nbsp; The concept of&nbsp;a Lasting Power of Attorney is also largely similar.&nbsp; The only difference being that in the UK, the properties and affairs of Lasting Power of Attorney can be used even while the person still has&nbsp;capacity.&nbsp; I did not want to be so liberal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as court power is concerned, it is largely similar.&nbsp; But, yes, the Member is right, there is a dedicated court in the UK to decide on all matters pertaining to this Act.&nbsp; They call it a Court of Protection.&nbsp; In our case, I will rely on the High Court.&nbsp; Of course, subsequently, if the Judiciary decides that they want to have a special court like the way they have a Family Court, that is something which may evolve in due time.&nbsp; But the point is&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;we are fully committed,&nbsp;both as far as legislation and judicial processes are concerned, to making sure that this legislation will work&nbsp;and none of us are pulling any punches.&nbsp; And I can assure&nbsp;Members that MCYS, MinLaw and the courts will do their best to make sure things are done properly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as statutory wills are concerned, we have also basically used the same framework that the UK is using.&nbsp; Many Members have asked, under what circumstances, would a court need to either execute or revoke a will?&nbsp; And this was the same question which I asked when the Law Society first came with this proposal.&nbsp; They have listed some of the situations&nbsp;for me and I will just quote this for Members' own consideration.&nbsp; For instance, where a person has remarried after making his first will, but before he makes his second will, suddenly becomes mentally incapacitated, and the result of the intestacy in those circumstances may be inappropriate.&nbsp; A second example where the primary beneficiary has predeceased the mentally incapacitated person so that, in effect, the latter is now intestate.&nbsp; The third example is where a property intended to be a legacy in an <p align=left>Column: 151<p>existing will no longer exists, for example, the court may have to order its sale so that its proceeds can be used for the medical care of the incapacitated person and therefore some other provisions will need to be made for a beneficiary.&nbsp; The fourth example, which I was given, was where there has been a major change in the mentally incapacitated person's circumstances or in his relationship with the beneficiaries in his will, for example, his spouse has divorced him.&nbsp; So the point is that there may be circumstances where a court may need to intervene.&nbsp; But this is a power which, I am sure, will be exercised very, very carefully and very stringently, and not something which, I believe, any of our courts will enter into lightly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me deal with the provisions which are unique to Singapore.&nbsp; We have gone into some detail to define \"best interest\".&nbsp; But one aspect which is different in ours compared to the UK is that we have gone on to emphasise this precept that the property must be preserved for the maintenance of the incapacitated person.&nbsp; So, in fact, our framework for allowing donees to make gifts is actually more restricted than that with the UK.&nbsp; In the UK, the donee is able to say&nbsp;that this was the customary gift he used to make on this occasion to his favourite standard charity, and so on, and so forth.&nbsp; So he could make such a gift as a continuation of past practice.&nbsp; We are&nbsp;more restrictive.&nbsp; We have said that the donee cannot make gifts unless, first of all, it is provided for expressly in the instrument setting up the Lasting Power of Attorney and, in any case, you cannot make gifts to a level which will compromise the adequacy of assets which will be used to provide for the mentally incapacitated person.&nbsp; So I assure Ms Sylvia Lim we are actually being more careful in Singapore than in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 152<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area where we are different from the UK is that we have restricted decisions under the Lasting Power of Attorney in so far as the Advance Medical Directive is concerned and also we have said that the donee or the deputy cannot make decisions&nbsp;with respect to the continuation or cessation of life sustaining and extraordinary medical treatment.&nbsp; One criticism which has been made about the UK legislation, although it may not be a fair criticism,&nbsp;is that&nbsp;if you give donees excessive power on medical decision, you may be providing a back door for euthanasia to be executed on the instructions of a donee who may, as several Members have quite rightly pointed out, have a conflict of interest.&nbsp; So, in our case, we have been very careful with the scope that medical decisions, especially&nbsp;the treatment necessary for life or treatment which if withheld would lead to significant deterioration are off-limits and medical professionals will exercise judgment in those areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area where we differ from the UK is that in cases where, for instance, a transaction involves a sale of property or a house or a flat, our banks have requested that they have a right to insist that they will not enter into such a transaction unless the donee can show medical evidence that the incapacity is permanent, and not something that waxes and wanes, which was a concern of Prof. Kalyani Mehta.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area where we are different is in our definition of \"wilful neglect\" and \"ill treatment\".&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, we have used a similar framework to that which we used in the Children and Young Persons Act.&nbsp; The UK, in fact, does not have a definition for \"wilful neglect\" and \"ill treatment\" in their Mental Capacity Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area where we are different, and I think it is worth highlighting, is that we have a specific whistle blower <p align=left>Column: 153<p>protection clause in our Bill.&nbsp; This, we have provided for after receiving feedback from the legal fraternity.&nbsp; So we have accorded healthcare workers immunity from liability for reporting suspected cases of ill treatment or wilful neglect of a mentally incapacitated person.&nbsp; This immunity does not extend to bankers and lawyers who are governed by the Banking Act and the Code of Professional Ethics respectively.&nbsp; The UK Act does not have a specific whistle blower protection provision in their Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are further details of excluded decisions which I can provide to Members subsequently.&nbsp; But let me assure this House that, in fact, we have been more careful than in a similar analogous framework which the UK has chosen to use.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members have raised questions about the definition of \"capacity\".&nbsp; I think it is worth highlighting that the legislation recognises that capacity can wax and wane.&nbsp; You may be capable of making a decision on this specific topic today, but you may not be tomorrow, or you may recover the day after.&nbsp; We recognise this and that is why we have ensured that the presumption is that the person has capacity until established otherwise.&nbsp; So the question of someone being just arbitrarily or prematurely defined as \"incapacitated\" and therefore a donee stepping in and exercising power inappropriately is a scenario which we did consider in&nbsp;the legislation.&nbsp; And&nbsp;Members are quite right that&nbsp;as we formulate the code of practice and the subsidiary legislation, we will make sure this protection is catered for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in defining \"best interest\", the point is that it is very difficult to come up with an encyclopedic, comprehensive definition of \"best interest\".&nbsp; What you see in the Bill before you is a checklist of things that a donee needs to go through before he makes a specific decision.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 154<p>checklist includes respecting the person's past and present express wishes, feelings, beliefs, values and also consulting with other persons who were close to the incapacitated person.&nbsp; In addition, we have also included this point that property must be preserved for the maintenance of the person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Bill does not allow donees or deputies to make decisions on behalf of incapacitated persons in relation to life sustaining treatment or treatment that is needed to prevent serious deterioration of health.&nbsp; This is a point which I alluded to earlier when I compared our legislation to that of the UK.&nbsp; Our Bill also gives precedence to the Advance Medical Directive, and I hope that these points will give some assurance to Mdm Halimah and Mr Sin Boon Ann that where there&nbsp;is any conflict of interest, the proxy decision-makers must be guided by the best interest of the person and the legislation will hold him or her to this standard of care and duty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also sets another key principle that we recognise fluctuating capacity and variable degradation of capacity, and therefore we need to make sure that there is appropriate mechanism to determine capacity.&nbsp; We could have made it&nbsp;pseudo accurate and very difficult by insisting, for instance, that only a psychiatrist could define \"capacity\".&nbsp; But I think even my colleague here, Dr Ong Seh Hong, will agree that there are not enough psychiatrists to go round.&nbsp; It would be onerous and it would ultimately be expensive.&nbsp; So we got agreement from the College of Family Physicians who had said that GPs can be trained so that they will be able to certify capacity or lack of capacity, either on a short-term or on a permanent basis.&nbsp; So we have to achieve the right balance between security and convenience.&nbsp; And, again, with consultation and with the participation of other stakeholders in this field, I think it is workable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 155<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also several questions raised by many Members with respect to the qualifying conditions for being a donee, specifically why did we exclude people who are bankrupts.&nbsp; As I said earlier, I had to make a choice between being very, very rigorous and having a long list of exclusions&nbsp;or having no exclusions at all.&nbsp; The argument for having a long list of exclusions is that people need protection and there are some people whom you cannot trust.&nbsp; The argument for having zero or minimal restriction is that it gives people a choice&nbsp;&ndash; they are choosing their own family members, their own friends, their own colleagues whom they trust.&nbsp; Well, we lean more towards giving people a choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of people who are bankrupts, I want to emphasise, we were not casting any value judgments about their honesty or ability.&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to exclude bankrupts simply because an undischarged bankrupt has legal impediments to him performing certain functions such as, for instance, acting as a trustee or acting as a company director.&nbsp; And we felt that these legal impediments may complicate their work in so far as they were performing the work of a donee on property and affairs.&nbsp; Even in the UK, they have kept this disqualification against people who are bankrupt.&nbsp; I also want to emphasise that people who are bankrupts can act as donees as far as the personal welfare of the person who is mentally incapacitated is concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;This disqualification is restricted only to the management of property and affairs.&nbsp; But it is not meant to be a value judgement or to cast aspersions on the ability and on the love and devotion of people who may be bankrupt for a variety of reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also questions, I think from Prof. Kalyani and also from Mr Hri Kumar, with regard to some process issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Mr Hri Kumar has a <p align=left>Column: 156<p>good suggestion that there may be some proceedings which are better heard in camera in order to protect the privacy of the people concerned, and clause 39, which sets out the system for generating rules of court, does provide <I>inter alia</I> for&nbsp;hearings in camera.&nbsp; This is something which the court can generate subsequently</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>if it feels it is warranted.&nbsp; Similarly, this issue of disclosure, especially where there are conflicts of interest, I believe can also be covered under the rules of court or under the code of practice which we intend to generate over the next few months to a year.&nbsp; Clause 24(10)(b) also imposes a duty on the deputies to submit reports which the court can specify from time to time with respect to the performance of his or her duty.&nbsp; So the point is that there are safeguards and there will continue to be new safeguards which we will need to evolve but we will do so using the rules of court and the code of practice and we will do so in close consultation with all the stakeholders.&nbsp; I also want to reassure Mr Hri Kumar that this Bill does not change the principle of legal privilege.&nbsp; I think as a lawyer, he wants that assurance.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;give that to him.&nbsp; I made sure.&nbsp; I checked with the AG's Chambers before I gave this assurance to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have to set up the Office of Public Guardian.&nbsp; As I said in my earlier speech, it will contribute to the protection of those who lack capacity.&nbsp; Some of you are worried that we may have vested too much investigative power into the Office of Public Guardian.&nbsp; I think this is a matter of judgment.&nbsp; At this point in time, my view is that people with mental incapacity are specially vulnerable.&nbsp; We have been quite liberal as far as allowing&nbsp;persons to qualify as donees and deputies.&nbsp; The <I>quid pro quo</I> there is that I want to make sure that this office is in a position to investigate fully and quickly and expediently any potential abuses of powers by donees and deputies.&nbsp; I am sure this is not the last word on this topic <p align=left>Column: 157<p>but I am asking the indulgence of this House that these are new areas, new laws, new offices and new processes we are setting up.&nbsp; Let us do so carefully.&nbsp; If later on we find that we really do not need to vest such powers in this office, then we can review or&nbsp;consider an amendment, but not at this stage.&nbsp; I prefer to be careful at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There will also be a Board of Visitors that will support the Office of Public Guardian and the court in carrying out investigations on matters relating to the exercise of powers under this Act.&nbsp; This Board will investigate possible abuse, in addition to checking on the general well-being&nbsp;of incapacitated persons.&nbsp; The Board will comprise professionals and have healthcare expertise as well as lay persons without medical qualifications.&nbsp; Mr Sin has quite rightly emphasised that the Board of Visitors and the Public Guardian must pursue their duties rigorously and I give Members the assurance that my Ministry will provide the resources to this Office so that they will do a good job.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that Mdm Halimah and Mr Sin Boon Ann are assuaged by the precautions that we have set out in this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also heard Prof. Kalyani's&nbsp;concern that some family members may be reluctant to be donees.&nbsp; They may be afraid of being punished for ill-treatment because, as she said, someone may have just laid one accusation against them.&nbsp; I am sure Members will appreciate that we need to strike a balance.&nbsp; On the one hand, we need sufficient safeguards.&nbsp; On the other hand, the safeguards should not be so excessive that they deter people from serving as donees.&nbsp; We have considered this issue very carefully and we have sought to achieve the right balance in drafting the legislation.&nbsp; But I think we will have to do more work in coding the code of practice because that is when we can give more guidance, go <p align=left>Column: 158<p>into greater detail and granularity about the circumstances which things may or may not be said or done and ensure the right balance between protecting people who are mentally incapacitated and protecting their family members who are caring for them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff at the Office of Public Guardian will be trained.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be a specialised task and we will ensure that they can assist families and ordinary folks who would need information on making the Lasting Power of Attorney.&nbsp; As I&nbsp;said earlier,&nbsp;the England and Wales Mental Capacity Act was only enacted in 2005 and only fully implemented in October last year.&nbsp; They are still on a learning journey and I give Members the assurance that we will watch their learning journey and make adjustments accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One point which&nbsp;Ms Sylvia Lim&nbsp;asked&nbsp;about was that, in the UK, they have set up an independent advocate.&nbsp; That is a pilot scheme which they have set up.&nbsp; I think they have appointed 144 people, costing them a grand sum of &pound;6.5 million.&nbsp; I am not in a hurry to go and start up&nbsp;more bureaucracy and more inspectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is that families in Singapore are available by and large.&nbsp; This is a small place and I think there will be very few people who truly are destined to have no one else to look after their interests.&nbsp; For those people in Singapore, particularly those who are destitute and in our homes,&nbsp;the Ministry, my staff and the voluntary welfare organisations will have to play such an advocate role.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not keen at this stage to set up an elaborate Government bureaucracy at great expense to do this.&nbsp; Anyway, it is a pilot project, even in the UK.&nbsp; Let us watch and see before we jump into setting up this machinery.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So let me end by saying that this is&nbsp;a new legislation and I am sure this is not the last word.&nbsp; Mr Sam Tan has also emphasised that this is not just about <p align=left>Column: 159<p>legislation.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it is about values, attitudes, a sense of responsibility,&nbsp;duty and&nbsp;obligation, and we cannot legislate all these.&nbsp; It is worth&nbsp;reminding all of us that it still starts with family relations and friendships, and making sure our community continues to treasure people who are old.&nbsp; That they are not people whom we would give a coconut husk and tell them that they are disposable.&nbsp; Instead, people who are old,&nbsp;disabled or&nbsp;mentally incapacitated have value and&nbsp;dignity and deserve protection and choice, and this legislation is one small piece of the safety net, which all of us will have to build in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

SMEs can also receive funding for executive and managerial training, of up to 50% of course fees capped at $20 per trainee per hour.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA also actively works with SPRING Singapore and industry associations to reach out to SMEs.&nbsp; For example, WDA is working with the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) on a programme to reach out to SMEs and upgrade their HR capabilities through suitable HR courses under the Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) framework. In the manufacturing sector, WDA partners with various industry associations such as the Association of Process Industry (ASPRI) and the Singapore Precision Engineering and Tooling Association (SPETA), both of whom have many members which are SMEs, to promote skills upgrading as a means to improve organisational productivity and competitiveness.&nbsp; As a result of these efforts, the value of SDF training assistance for companies with less than 100 employees, has nearly doubled from $29 million in FY06 to $42 million in FY07.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CONSUMER PROTECTION (FAIR TRADING) ACT--><!--END_COL_TITLE:CONSUMER PROTECTION (FAIR TRADING) ACT:::164--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"></B><p align=left>Column: 161<p><P><B>CONSUMER PROTECTION (FAIR TRADING) ACT</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Inclusion of financial products and services--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Inclusion of financial products and services)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Siew Kum Hong </B>asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether the&nbsp; Government intends to exclude any financial products and services from the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act; (b) if so, how will such exclusions protect and benefit consumers; and (c) how will the new provisions governing a stay of proceedings impact consumers.&nbsp;</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><p align=left>Column: 163<p><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act or CPFTA was recently amended to include financial products and services. With the amendment, the CPFTA will now also protect consumers against unfair practices in transactions involving financial products and services.<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, financial institutions regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will not be subject to two specific provisions in the CPFTA that empower specified bodies (CASE and STB as stipulated in the CPFTA) to take action against errant traders. This is because MAS, as the regulator, is in a better position to enforce compliance with the law by taking formal regulatory actions against these institutions for regulatory breaches as well as require them to improve their internal compliance processes and procedures. There is therefore no need for a specified body to replicate MAS&rsquo; enforcement role. All other CPFTA provisions will apply to these financial institutions, and consumers will continue to have the right to seek civil remedies through the CPFTA.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 6 of the CPFTA allows the parties to a court action against a trader for an unfair practice, the option of applying to stay the proceedings when a specified body has applied to a court for a declaration or injunction relating to the same unfair practice. Consumers benefit from this provision as it allows them to rely on the outcome of the specified body&rsquo;s action. For example, if the court agrees with the specified body that the trader had engaged in an unfair practice, the consumer need not re-argue in court the issue of whether the practice was unfair. The result of the specified body&rsquo;s action may even prompt the trader to settle with the consumer. This process will allow both parties to save on the cost and effort of consumer actions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:TRANSPORTATION OF FOREIGN WORKERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:TRANSPORTATION OF FOREIGN WORKERS:::166--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"></B><p align=left>Column: 163<p><P><B>TRANSPORTATION OF FOREIGN WORKERS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Safety requirements--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Safety requirements)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Christopher de Souza </B>asked the Minister for Transport what steps will his Ministry take to ensure the safety of foreign workers when they are transported to and from work sites and whether minimum safety requirements such as proper seats and shelter from rain will be mandated.&nbsp;</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce business costs, owners and hirers of goods vehicles are currently allowed to use their vehicles to transport their workers to and from their places of work or business, subject to various safety regulations.

The first project along Kallang River at Kolam Ayer was completed in February this year, with strong community support for the project. There are now more activities such as morning exercises and community gardening at the waterfront, and Mid Autumn festival celebrations recently. The second project at Bedok Reservoir was completed in March this year.&nbsp; Since then, a number of activities have been held there, for example, the 'Hydro Sapiens' performance of the Singapore Arts Festival.&nbsp;

PUB also explores the use of innovative products and new technology to reduce construction and maintenance costs.&nbsp; For example, for the project at Bishan Park, PUB is exploring the use of concrete that is recycled from the redevelopment works to provide the material for the rock bedding instead of using imported natural rocks.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;A 2006 Students' Health Survey, jointly conducted by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and the Ministry of Education (MOE), found that 4% of Secondary 3 and 4 students have had sexual intercourse. Of these, 24% were sexually active (more than&nbsp;five times in the past 12 months).</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another study by NUS is currently underway to examine the correlation factors, including socio-economic and educational background.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several programmes are in place to address the rising trend of STIs among youths.&nbsp; The topic on STIs is included in the science syllabus and MOE has made it mandatory for schools to implement sexuality education.&nbsp; HPB complements it with its \"Breaking Down Barriers\" (BDB) programme, an STI/AIDS prevention programme targeted at Secondary 3 students.&nbsp; The BDB programme covers protective measures like abstinence and condom use, and life-skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation.&nbsp; STI/AIDS <p align=left>Column: 171<p>awareness and education programmes are also conducted for students in post-secondary and tertiary institutions.&nbsp; These programmes help the students to recognise the signs and symptoms of STIs and advise them on the appropriate medical follow-up.&nbsp; Those who are diagnosed with STIs are treated and counselled individually. HPB also works with Family Service Centres and other youth organisations to reach out to other youths to provide them with knowledge and skills to protect themselves against STIs.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents play an important role in the sexuality education of their children. HPB conducts regular \"Love Them. Talk about Sex.\" programmes in work places, schools and community venues.&nbsp; These offer parents information and tips on how to broach and discuss sexuality issues, including STIs, with their children. A toolkit, helpline and website (www.letstalkaboutsex.sg/parents) have also been developed.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through these programmes, we aim to reduce the incidence of STIs among youths over time.&nbsp; We will repeat the Students' Health Survey every three years to monitor the effectiveness of these programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:NEW BRIDGE ROAD, EU TONG SEN STREET AND SOUTH BRIDGE ROAD--><!--END_COL_TITLE:NEW BRIDGE ROAD, EU TONG SEN STREET AND SOUTH BRIDGE ROAD:::172--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"></B><p align=left>Column: 171<p><B><P>NEW BRIDGE ROAD, EU TONG SEN STREET AND SOUTH BRIDGE ROAD</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Data on traffic speeds before imposition of ERP--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Data on traffic speeds before imposition of ERP)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan </B>asked the Minister for Transport if he will provide data on traffic speeds that had occurred for the three-month period prior to the imposition of ERP at New Bridge Road, Eu Tong Sen Street and South Bridge Road.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the implementation of the ERP gantries along the Singapore River Line, traffic speeds across the three ERP gantries in the southbound direction and across the two ERP gantries in the northbound direction were below the lower threshold speed of 20 km/hr from 6.00 pm to 7.30 pm on weekdays, reaching as low as 18 km/hr.&nbsp; The ERP was imposed to ensure that speeds on these roads can be restored to the optimal speed range of 20-30 km/hr.<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P>\t        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
